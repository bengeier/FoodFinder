{"text":"Having eaten here several times, I was unsure between 3 and 4 stars as some visits/meals were better than others. Pretty solid fare, bar food type. Not the best atmosphere inside - kind of dark, gets a bit loud, still enjoyable though.

Highly Recommended:
Buffalo Chicken Mac & Cheese 
Skinny Dip (Buffalo Chicken Dip with Chips)
Hog Heaven, especially because of the side horseradish sauce.
Russet/Sweet Potato Fry Mix

Average:
Rosemary's Breast
Burger
Salads (in general)

They are known for having great pizzas, but I've only ever had a bite here and there.

Half price after 11 is always super crowded.
Good happy hour beer prices.

When getting takeout, I do feel the portions are smaller."}
{"text":"For appetizer we had the Mussels and it was delicious. For dinner we had the Moby Dick and it was amazing. We also had the Smashed Potato Pizza and it was awesome and it is not what you expect to be in a good way. Drinks were good also."}
{"text":"I love this place, having been here tons of times. Half price after 11pm. There will be lots of people waiting outside since 10:45pm. If you have a group of more than 2, you may have to wait for up to one hour. I personally love their wings, thai me up skewers, fire-baked brie and big ass brownie."}
{"text":"Great bar food and awesome beer selection.  This place is by far my favorite spot in Oakland.  
The wood fired pizzas are super tasty and not a single thing on their menu comes from a freezer packet. 
It can be a little loud at times but that's to be expected from a place in the middle of a college campus."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place since it opened.  Great staff.  Great food.  Excellent place to go to watch a game, just hang out, or have a good meal.  New owner (former emloyee has worked there for years) has made some some awesome upgrades.  Huge whiskey and beer selection.  Don't cry about a wait if you come at a busy time.  It's  worth the wait.  Hope they bring back the catfish sandwich."}
{"text":"Pizza here is pretty decent, and with Half-price, extremely cheap ($3) That alone makes Fuel worthwhile. However, I wouldnt really consider coming here during regular price hours (before 11). If you do come during halfprice, be prepared to wait for a table and than only get average service by the overworked staff. But for these prices, I dont complain too much"}
{"text":"As much as I've enjoyed my awkward trips to F&F, I can't explain what's so great about it.  The service is average during normal hours, and (understandably) terrible during half price.  The crowds of fellow college students means I'm sometimes in the cold for upwards of half an hour, waiting for a table.  And by the time I'm done, the buses aren't necessarily running, so I have to walk home in the cold.  But it's still quintessentially college to me, so I keep coming back.

I actually don't like most of the food.  The vegetarian sandwich I got was kind of bland and the bread was pretty terrible.  Not a fan of the pizzas or nachos either, though I know some people are crazy about them.  It seems overpriced for the quality, except maybe during half price... but then you're tipping double and possibly ordering drinks, so you're not saving a ton of money.

Some pluses: they have a terrific beer selection (or so I'm told; I don't drink beer) and great wings (again, I don't eat them).  But I do eat the sweet potato fries... mmm, only $1 for a side of sweet fries if you're here after 11 pm."}
{"text":"I haven't lived in Pittsburgh for 4 years, and even now after all this time, on a Thursday night I wish I was still lived in Oakland so a few friends and I could hit up Fuel for some dinner and drinks. 
Fuel is the best place in Oakland at night, particularly if your over 21. It's a little crowded but the beer selection (100 different varieties) is the best virtually anywhere. The half price menu starts at 11, so you can go there get dinner and drinks with some friends and it's a good night. 
The food is always excellent, and after 11 a good value. 
The service is always good. 
I love the ambiance of the place, but I could see how people could find it irritating. It's loud (particularly when there is live music) and it is crowded. However in my four years going to fuel this never once dissuaded me, because the half priced menu is just too good and trying the new beers is just too much fun."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant for what it is - bar food, but bar food done right.  The brick oven pizzas are exceptional and the menu contains a few unique topping options - see the \"smashed potato\" pizza.  The sandwiches and burgers all come on delicious twist rolls made by a local bakery.  The wings a crispy and drowned in a number of spicy sauces.  The half price menu after 11pm is worth showing up early and waiting for, but occasionally you get what you pay for (wings lacking on sauce, etc.).

The beer list is what really shines here.  With over 100 bottles and around 10 rotating draft selections, there's always something new to try.  You can even join their beer cult, try all 100 brews in their beer bible and get your name up on the wall.  The cult's motto - shut up and drink."}
{"text":"Love the beer selection and the fun atmosphere here. The stone fire pies and wings are awesome plus they have a great late night menu! Definitely worth a stop in Oakland."}
{"text":"I've only been here during late night for their half off menu. The chipotle polka pierogies are my personal favorite because it is spicy and savoury topped of with some sour cream to balance the spice. I've tried their smash potato pizza and the margherita pizza as well, both pizzas were flavorful with a nice thin crust.  

Great place for late night, will surely be back!"}
{"text":"I would never, for any reason, eat here during the school year (mid-August until May). The food is just not THAT good, if you know what I mean. The place is also small, with too many small jammed together tables and is pretty loud, even in the summer in the afternoon.  

That said, I have eaten here several times and the food has always been fine. I usually get the rosemary chicken or campfire steak and potatoes salad. Those have both been consistently good. My husband usually gets one of the chicken wraps - and they have also been decent. They give you a mix of russet and sweet potato fries -- if you get them when they just come out of the fryer, both are pretty good. But we have also gotten some cold, stale ones. They still don't taste horrible, but you won't be raving about them. 

We totally skip appetizers here, they are small and over priced. Two small-medium sized vegetable egg rolls cut in half for 7.00 dollars seems a bit insane, especially since you can get ones that are a superior quality (less oily and the filling isn't mush) right around the corner for 1.25 a piece. 

Next would be service - honest, it's probably the reason why we don't come here more often. Your order is taken quick and the food always comes reasonably fast, but on more than one occasion our server has never came back until she (we've never had a male server) drops the check off. We usually tip around 20% for good service, this place we consistently tip less.  Servers and hostesses have a tendency to gather near the back toward the hallway to the restrooms -- talking to one another or using their cell phones."}
{"text":"Yikes.  This was not my favorite find in Pittsburgh.  The food was moderate to bad, the wait staff didn't know what was on tap, and the booths were made of cinder blocks.  I might have felt differently about the place if I were 21, but as a 30-something it was seriously lacking."}
{"text":"Great food and great staff!

I ordered a burger and it was cooked just the way I ordered it and the fries were spot on!  Bar food is hit or moss, but this was a home run!

I am an out-of-towner, but travel here for business and will certainly be back next time around.  

What should I try next...hmmmm????"}
{"text":"It is one of the greasiest places you can go to in Oakland. My friend and I were recently looking for an American restaurant that we wouldn't need a reservation or have to wait for a table and decided to go to Fuel and Fuddle. I ordered nachos and there was oil or grease on the chips and all over the plate.  The chips that did not have any cheese on them were still covered in the oil. It was bizarre, confusing, and overall disgusting. Do they put grease on their plates before putting the food on? My friend got the turkey burger was not a fan of it either; now we know why there is never a line here. If you like greasy food, this place is for you!"}
{"text":"Do not order this for delivery. It was a thrown together, greasy mess of soggy bacon, all the sour cream in Pittsburgh, and an occasional piece of chicken on the pizza that someone apparently just threw some lettuce on. Atrocious. I've never had such a bad delivery order. 10/10 will not order from here again."}
{"text":"Fuel and fuddle is always a great place to eat.  We went there after we saw the wait at Pamela's Diner.  But we weren't disappointed in our second choice.   They had Great Lakes Christmas Ale on draft which is amazing!  There were five of us and we we were seated right away.  Our server was very nice and attentive.  Our table ordered the smashed potato pizza, buffalo chicken pizza, and BBQ chicken pizza.  The smashed potato and buffalo chicken were amazing but the BBQ was disappointing.  However, the other food, atmosphere, and beer choice were excellent!"}
{"text":"In town for a wedding. Rollafatty was ok - didn't actually see/taste any pepperoni. Naked truth pizza and a house salad (with roquefort) for main course was great. Apple thing for dessert was huge. Like a pizza with 3 scoops of ice cream. Solid beer selection. Sandwiches all looked really good. People next to us had buffalo chicken dip - smelled horrible, but looked interesting."}
{"text":"I ended up ordering the Hog Heaven Sandwich which has pulled pork, cheddar cheese, and applewood smoked bacon. As a fan of pulled pork I thought the sandwich was tasty, however, the thing that won me over were the sweet potato fries and the delicious dipping sauce that they provided. I highly recommend fuel and fuddle and I'm excited to try other items on their menu soon!"}
{"text":"Fuel and Fuddle has been my favorite place since I set foot on Pitt's campus four years ago.  This place is fantastic!  

Yeah, so it's a little loud in the evening - but so worth it.  If you're looking for a more relaxed dining experience, go before all of the students come in to take advantage of the late-night 1/2 price menu.  However, this place is often crowded, because it's just so darn good.

Great beer selection and even better American bar food.  My appetizer of choice is the Dive Diner Fries.  For dinner: I love the sandwiches, which come with a yummy mixture of fries and sweet potato fries.  The pizzas are great also.  And dessert - split the Big Azz Brownie with somebody.  

Overall a great place, you just have to be willing to put up with the hustle and bustle of a busy restaurant at the heart of a college campus."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after a particularly disappointing steelers loss. Good service, nice atmosphere. I ordered the Havana burger, modeled after a Cuban sandwich. While my buddy ordered the pulled pork. Both sandwiches came with both regular and sweet potato fries, the sweet potato fries were excellent. We also split the buffalo chicken dip which was the highlight of the meal for me. Not much wrong with this joint. Burger was a little overcooked but not enough to ruin it. Will definitely be back at some point in the future."}
{"text":"Pretty good! They were able to accommodate us - a group of 17 people. Our server was great. Lots of choices for drinks and food was good. Nothing to complain."}
{"text":"Fuel & Fuddle is known for its beer selection, burgers and brick oven pizzas. Their burgers are generally served on really nice Kaiser rolls that are plush like pillows and the sweet potato fries are quite excellent. Their pizzas are also some of the best around in Oakland. The beer selection is quite diverse although rather overpriced.

For larger parties, there is an area downstairs with a couple of televisions tuned to sport channels (although your experience with service will suffer). 

Unfortunately I don't think I can rank this otherwise fine establishment any higher due to its inconsistent service. There has been too many times when it has been difficult getting a check or the attention of the staff. I attribute this to poor training compounded by the flaws of my generation."}
{"text":"I ordered a Bayou Chicken Salad from GrubHub for lunch. It was delicious and a generous portion. Lots of chicken, nice fresh greens, hard boiled eggs, bacon, and tomato."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Even on a packed night at 11:30, we were still able to get a table in less than five minutes. The atmosphere is great, with friendly staff and patrons.

We ordered a buffalo chicken pizza, which was just about perfect with its thin crust and brick oven charred bits. We also ordered the dip sticks (with mozzarella) and the zen wraps as \"appetizers\" (they would probably be considered entree-sized at most other restaurants). The dip sticks were a bit zippier than expected, but still pretty good with the marinara sauce. The zen wraps were quite unique, and incredibly delicious.

We ended up having to take a lot of our food home, because there was so much of it (even though it was only two apps and a personal pizza). I would suggest starting with one dish and going from there.

This is the place to go for late night munchies and decent prices. We'll definitely be going again before our trip is over!"}
{"text":"The decor is cool and funky. There is a nice amount of car and road trip inspired memorabilia--signs, hub caps, license plates, etc. The bathroom downstairs was kinda gross, not unexpected for a college joint--the floor tiles were cracked, the urinal stalls had dried on spray on them and the smell was like someone dropped a case of air fresheners in a portapotty

The service was attentive and the hostess did a great job accommodating our large party of 6 adults and 2 children at 6 pm on a Saturday without reservations. The servers delivered drinks quickly and gave us enough time to make decisions on food without having us feel like we waited forever. 

The food overall, was fine, but a bit disappointing. I ordered the \"Aporkalyse Now\", which is a burger with 50/50 beef/bacon burger topped with more bacon, pickled banana peppers, and melted cheese. This was pretty disappointing. I asked for the burger to be cooked medium, but the server said that because it has raw pork in it, it had to be cooked medium well but it would be juicy still--however, it wasn't. The burger was dry. The kaiser roll the burger was on was cold, dry, and stale. The fries were cold and soggy. For a self-proclaimed \"gastropub\" the food was very poorly executed. My dining companions ordered the pulled pork (which they really enjoyed) and the quinoa burger (also dry). Everyone else's fries were warm to hot, so my cold fries were a definite kitchen miscue. 

The beer selection was very good. The bottle list was impressive and the draft list featured diverse offerings that varied in both style and alcohol levels. The prices were very reasonable for all the beers for $3.50 for a yuengling pint to a $6 Lagunitas Barleywine

I think Fuel and Fuddle would be a great place to hang out, have a snack, and a pint of craft beer. However, to call this place a gastropub sets up unrealistic expectations"}
{"text":"Have had their food before, but not recently.  We ordered their food through \"Wheel Deliver\" and it was as good as I remember.  The Psychedelic - portobello mushroom sandwich with sweet potato fries was excellent.  Everyone at lunch enjoyed their food."}
{"text":"Came here a lot during my CMU days.  Good beer selection and yummy pizzas, and there's a half off menu after 11pm."}
{"text":"This place was okay. The atmosphere is kinda strange and like it's trying to be Coyote Ugly The Movie but then it's also like \"oh wait, we also have to be like a family restaurant.\" So the service was... hmmm... \"sassy\" maybe. But not exactly the greatest.

However, my salmon salad was very nice. The fish was tasty, maybe too many onions, but the spinach was fresh and our server put the viniagrette on the side, which I would definitely recommend.

The restaurant's really small, so if you go when it's really busy (it was full but not too busy on a summer Sunday evening) you might have to wait. If the wait's more than fifteen minutes, I'd find another place, though."}
{"text":"Great place to go after work, good selection of drinks and food! Service is fast and friendly. So many choices of whiskeys cant wait to go back to try more. Phat wraps are delicious."}
{"text":"I stopped by with my boyfriend for the late night specials (11 pm to 1 am) last week. Although the deal was good (we took advantage of $5 pizzas and $2 sides), I don't think I'll be returning.

The place was a typical sports bar, dimly lit. We were seated in a corner, and although no one was sitting near us, the place felt cramped. Our waitress was just going through the motions and seemed annoyed. 

The food wasn't that great, either. The sweet potato fries, which were the main reason I wanted to try this place and are advertised as \"world-famous,\" had a great, crisp texture, but were way too heavily seasoned. I would've preferred them plain. We also ordered the Classic Maggie live fire pie (a pizza), which was a plain pizza with about three pieces of basil on it. The crust under the cheese was soggy; there was nothing special about the pizza.

All in all, a good deal for under $10 including tax and tip, but I probably won't be returning, especially not if I have to pay full price."}
{"text":"Incredible wings!  Seriously!  We ordered Carolina - extra crispy - which exceeded the expectations of us wing connoisseurs. Service was fast and polite. Our server offered great recommendations on beer draft specials and sandwiches."}
{"text":"I am staying in Pittsburgh for a month, and after going to many of the restaurants in the area, this is by far my favorite.  I ordered their Buffalo Burger, which was absolutely great.  I am normally not a fan of sweet potato fries but theirs were really good.  Their beer selection is large, which was great for me (normally I cannot find the Hoffbrau Dunkel at most restaurants).  I will definitely be going back there, probably getting one of their pizzas when I am done writing this review."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches (meat loaf is best) and pizzas.  Decent Draft list. Probably your best food option in south oakland. You experience will vary depending how jammed it is."}
{"text":"The Place: Clean, Casual
The Service: Inviting, Friendly, Quick
The Food: Variety, Flavorful

One of my Favorite Places to eat in the \"burgh\".  House Salad, BBQ Wings, Kick Gas Nacho's, Rosemary's Breast (Hold the Mustard, BBQ on the Side) with the INCREDIBLE Sweet Potato Fries!

Half-Price Menu after 11:00pm"}
{"text":"You know, I used the be down with Fuel, but... I'm tired of being abused by the 2 hour wait during half-price times, by the horrible collection of offensively dressed Pitt students (do you really have to do your makeup if you're wearing sweats? come on), by the 12-person CMU nerd squads.

The food is good, the beer selection is excellent... but christ, I don't really need a $3 sandwich THAT badly."}
{"text":"Fuel is the ultimate South Oakland place to eat.  It has it all:  great beer selection, delicious food (sweet potato fries and chipotle polka are my faves), half-price after 11:00PM, and good atmosphere.

The food here is bar food taken to the next level with fresh and house-made ingredients.  There's still plenty of fried stuff, but it's always done with a twist or some kind of strange ingredient to keep it interesting.

The drink menu is full of powerful cocktails (16oz for 6 bucks) - try the 5-speed, you won't regret it.  The beer selection is the real star here though, with a constantly rotating tap selection with some real winners, and decent house brews.

Service is spot-on.  Bartenders are knowledgeable and helpful. 

BOTTOM LINE:  Great food and drinks.  Half-price after 11.  A little step to the left of normal South Oakland fare, and a great place to start or end your night."}
{"text":"BBQ pizza and Bayou Blues wings(dry rub) are a must have!!! Wings seasoned Perfectly!!!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere... Great Greek salad... and awesome chili... Huge servings... Had to get to go bags which for me is rare."}
{"text":"This is actually one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh.  I think it gets written off as a collegey Oakland place.  It is clearly a collegey Oakland place, but it also has some of the best bar food in the region.  The wings are excellent, crisp, juicy, big with good sauces.  They are some of the best wings in the city, up there with Bufflao Blues and Quaker Stake.  The pizzas are excellent, especially the mashed potato pizza.  I encourage everyone to try it, wonderful smashed potatos, chedder cheese, bacon, lettuce and ranch dressing.  Their other pizzas are good as well.  They also have a wonderful selection of very good sandwiches and burgers.  Their stake and potatoes and alligator stew are also excellent.  It's an all around good place that takes all of their food and drinks seriously.  Can't go wrong with anything here."}
{"text":"Came here after 11pm with a friend, entire menu is practically half off! 
Come around 10:45 and get your name on the list, when a table opens up they'll call you in - get's to be pretty packed around 12.

sweet potato fries = awesome 
buffalo chicken pizza = awesome-r!!
wings = awesom-est!!!

everything ends up to be about 4.50 each, service is good too. 95.54% chance you'll go into a food coma afterwards.

lively place filled with college crowd,  i would most def. come here again."}
{"text":"Cool place.  Lots of beers on tap, though menu didn't really have them right.  Just look at the chalkboard.  Pulled pork sandwich was great.  Of course it is loud, it is packed with people on a Friday night.  And service was great for us."}
{"text":"Visits: Once, for lunch.

Food: I'm not a pub crawler, and I don't really like pub food, so my opinion comes with a shaker of salt. To me, it was standard American food, done bland and soggy - the fried cod sandwich was pretty flavorless, and so was the sauce that came with it (it was orange but tasted like salty mayo with no heat). Maybe I ordered the wrong thing - maybe they're no good with fried fish. But if they're no good with it, why offer it at all? The portion size was generous, but I honestly felt like I was eating fish cardboard on a bun. The fries were all soggy, despite being fully inundated with oil, to the point where the sweet potato fries tasted more like oil than sweet potato. Two points off.

Atmosphere: It works, I guess. I honestly think the decor is kind of confusing. I don't think it knows if it wants to be a restaurant or a bar - the bar area is a standard bar, but the booth and table seating screams 50s restaurant. The two don't really match, especially since the booth/table seating is significantly shorter than the bar (which is directly adjacent, so it's not like it's offset). One point off.

Service: No complaints here. Prompt and friendly.

Cost/Benefit: The portion size was pretty good for the price. The quality may not be, but they don't skimp, and I'm not going to ding twice for the same thing.

I rated a similar bar/restaurant combo in Boston (Sunset Grill and Tap). I gave it four stars even though I didn't enjoy it, because it hit all the right buttons for people who want that kind of thing. This, however, wasn't enjoyable for me, had memorably bad food, didn't give the impression that it would be a fun bar atmosphere for that kind of audience, and was overpriced. I'm guessing the good reviews come from the wide variety of drinks, which I didn't have. But if that's what it's for, why bother having a restaurant at all?

Also, this is a random side note, but I hate the menu. It's \"trendy\" as hell, and makes you read the descriptions just to know what the main part of the food is for half the items. \"bat out of hell\" = meatloaf. \"bada bing\" = sausage. Whyyyy??? I don't necessarily mind gimmicky names, but I'd like to at least know what the main foodstuff in the menu item is at a glance."}
{"text":"wood fired pizza selection, and quality was strong. wide beer selection (on tap.) wait staff was helpful and we had a relaxing Saturday afternoon just visiting."}
{"text":"Traveling for work again solo and was staying at the Hilton close by.  Decided to walk towards Univ. of Pitt and found this place.  It has a casual bar atmosphere that attracts both a younger college crowd plus a post work corporate crowd.  I had a burger which was very good.  The fries were awesome.  Probably will be my dinner choice next time I stay in this area."}
{"text":"The food is a bit over priced but it is definitely delicious and perfect comfort food. Highly recommend the smashed potato pizza, definitely the best thing on the menu or their skinny dip.  I am so sad they do not have their half price food after 11pm anymore, but their late night $5 menu is just as good."}
{"text":"My family and I just ordered takeout from Fuel and Fuddle today and we were all impressed! After, trying it for take out I definitely want to go back and actually eat in the restaurant. I actually learned about Fuel & Fuddle by searching for the best sweet Potato fries in Pittsburgh lol and Fuel & Fuddle popped up. I ordered the Sierra grilled chicken salad and it was pretty good! I'm on a special diet so I was a little limited on what I could get and a salad sounded wonderful! The Balsamic Vinigrette was amazing!! The sweet potato fries were the highlight of ordering however! They were so great and crispy!!"}
{"text":"Fuel and Fuddle has great food, and half off after midnight is awesome.  The service is usually good and attentive, and it is great for taking groups.  They are very accommodating."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner. Beer list was extensive. This was your average gastro pub food fare. We had the nachos and the bbq chicken pizza. The food was ok, prices right and service was friendly."}
{"text":"Good beer selection and a reasonably varied menu are probably the highlights of what is otherwise one of the more famous University of Pittsburgh college hang outs. 

My son frequents this place and raves about the hanger steak,  the muscles,and  the pulled pork sandwich. 

I had the muscles-  I had to say while the portions were on the small side - the overall quality of the muscles and how they were prepared was excellent. 

The beer selections outstanding. 

All in-  pretty good execution and good value for the money."}
{"text":"Decent bar food when sober, absolutely revelatory when not.

Appetizers tend to be good and filling. Chicken wings are sizable and the seasonings are unique. Everything really benefits from treatment in the live fire. Nachos are excessively cheesy but benefit from wood firing, as does the quesadilla. The optional chicken chili on both of these dishes is hearty and smoky.

Main courses are a bit of a mixed bag. All the pizzas are delicious, as the oven imparts a nice char and crispness to the crust. Sandwiches are disappointing, as the bread they serve everything on is far too doughy and chewy without much crust to speak of. Burgers suffer from a lack of seasoning and inspired toppings. Fries are overhyped, both Uncle Sam's and Joe Mama's on the same street offer far superior versions. The sweet potato fries are decent, but again overhyped. Steer clear of the big plates, every time I've ordered one I wished I got a pizza instead.

Desserts are wonderful, but let's be honest, when aren't they?

Don't miss the great beer selection. House brown and pale ale are always on tap and fairly good, other than these they keep 8 others rotating draughts. The bottle list is gargantuan, there's bound to be something for everyone.

Atmosphere is LOUD and service isn't always on par. But hey it's a college spot, what do you expect?

In short don't miss the apps, wood fired pizzas, and great beer list. Avoid the bland sandwich offerings and big plates."}
{"text":"If you are looking for sugary, greasy late night food, this is the perfect place.  Came for late night snacks with a large group of friends.  The brownie is just as giant as the menu description claims, and the Brie was swimming in oil in a delightfully unhealthy way.  Our servers may have been a bit annoyed with us due to our group's size and the time we walked in the door.  However, even though we weren't all seated together, we all had a pretty great time."}
{"text":"Are they still doing happy hour? If they are, it's a good deal for the food you get. It's a good late night hang out spot for students. Cheap eats, pretty chill vibe. 

Really loud and dim inside during happy hour. Make sure you go before 11 to put your name down, because the place fills up really quickly.

The food at normal price, for the quality and portion, is overpriced imo."}
{"text":"There is some really great food here with a fun atmosphere to boot. Total late night food. They have some really good pizza here (my favorite is the Humpty Dumpty, which is Italian sausage, bacon, mozzarella, and scrambled eggs topped off with olive oil), and on top of that, some good build your own burgers, and even some great desserts (I'm looking at you, nutter butter pie).

If I could, I would stop here more often."}
{"text":"Since being in Pittsburgh for college (it's been a smidge over two months) I've eaten here five or six times and I have yet to be disappointed. Like a good consumer should, I've tasted my way around F&F's diverse menu, ordering something different each time, in addition to mooching a bite of my friends' dishes as well. What I have to say about the dishes I've had:
Havana Burger - unique. I love the aioli, the ham, and beef all working together here. Not a huge fan of the heavy buns that are served here, but the contents make up for that. 
Hog Heaven - I'm a pulled pork lover, and theirs really hits the spot. I think they use their own bbq sauce, and it's the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. The meat is shredded evenly, and I never got a disappointingly dry lump of pork in my bite. Props! The pepper horseradish dip this sandwich comes with is AMAZING with the sweet potato fries. Maybe even better than it is on the sandwich!
Smashed Potato Pizza - If you love carbs like I do, get this pizza. Everything great about loaded potato skins and pizza in one personal flatbread. Do it. 
Build-your-own Burger - Got a classic burger with pickles, onions, lettuce, mayo, topped with a fried egg. Only gripe was the dense bun again. 
Pulled Pork Quesadilla - I honestly don't know why this works. It is fantastic... The quesadilla flows over with deliciously juicy pulled pork and a mix of gooey cheeses. Served with a house salsa and sour cream. Enough to fill a grown man. 

In general:
- Fries here are great. They do a mix of russet and sweet potato fries. They are the only sweet potatofries I have ever liked.
- Atmosphere is perfect for what they're marketing. Bar and grill with the feeling of a dive bar and a resteraunt at the same time. (If you use the bathroom in the basement you'll understand me a little more) Sometimes it can be a bit dark or too loud, but always to a manageable degree. 
- Service is friendly, but sometimes the workers forget to be up to date with resteraunt policy. Sometimes the check could be split, sometimes my school id is an accepted form of paymentand sometimes not, and a hostess once forgot there was outdoor seating for the resteraunt. 

Bonus points:
- Fuel & Fuddle. Fuel: Recieve energy from food. Fuddle: Confuse someone by using alcohol. Name isn't just catchy, but clever too! 
- From 11pm-1am they have a killer $5 menu (includes many things I enjoy) 
- I don't drink, but they have a wide, WIDE, variety of drinks to choose from.

Verdict: You'd be dumb not to try this place out. If you enjoy it, you'll come here lot!"}
{"text":"This has been a go to place for me since college.  I haven't been in a while and heard they added some new menu items. This place never disappoints as the service is quick and the food always tasty.  This is also the place to go if you are looking for a unique beer to try as they always have a great selection of drafts. I went with the Blue Point Pumpkin which is one of the better pumpkin beers.  The pizzas are always a good choice as they are baked in a fire brick oven. It was between the smashed potato (highly recommend) which I always get and the flying buffalo. I went with the flying buffalo which was topped with pieces of wings, celery and blue cheese. Delicious!  Also a neat thing about this restaurant is they give you a fortune cookie with your bill. I foresee another great dinner at Fuel very soon!"}
{"text":"Love it!  Especially their smashed potato pizza.  Just don't go planning to stick to a clean, healthy diet."}
{"text":"Really good pizza!  Excellent  crust.
The pizza  size was perfect for sharing.
We added a nice avocado salad.

Service was attentive."}
{"text":"As my go to place for quick food after studying, it can't get much better. the food is great quality and has a great variety of food. with creative names for their food like rollin a fatty and hog heaven, it allows you to have a lot of fun. They participate in half off, which a lot of local restaurants do. after a certain time, food on their menu goes half off. Its a great way for you to get a late night bite after studying 2 blocks away in hillman or in the cathedral. Their pizzas are great too. With all of their food they use great ingredients which comes out in their food. i would recommend this to all"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fun, appetizing meal, then Fuel & Fuddle is the place to go! Whatever you get, I highly recommend the sweet potato fries! This is a place that I would deem as a typical college hangout in Oakland."}
{"text":"If you live anywhere in Pittsburgh and want a decent cheap meal and good beer selection do yourself a favor and head over to fuel. It's the perfect image of a 'hole in the wall' for Oakland, so it does draw the younger college students, and the seating is usually pretty tight, if you don't mind that you'll be greatly rewarded."}
{"text":"A nice place to stop in for a beer in Oakland. A drawback for me is that it typically draws the younger college crowds, particularly on the weekends- and it's a relatively smaller place so it gets absolutely packed. And while the beer selection is typically good to very good, I stopped by twice in the last week and they don't have any pumpkin beers on tap! Come on, guys; it's the best time of year for seasonal beer..."}
{"text":"I ordered the Sierra chicken salad. It was alright. The chicken was a little burnt and the dressing had an odd flavor, but the portion was large. I think it was a bit overpriced. Also, my friend and I were seated downstairs for lunch and employees kept going into this store room near us. It was rather annoying because it was constant."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers to begin with. The wings, sweet potato fries are awesome. We had to order extra after we finished our main entrees. The hog heaven pull pork sandwich is really good too. Only complain i had was the chipotle polka pierogies came soaked in grease. 
The place is a little loud but the atmosphere is fun! Typical college crowd. Best of all most of the items on the food menu are half off after 11 pm!"}
{"text":"I love this place mostly because I used to live on the same street Oakland ave and that they have late night halfsies.  

I adore their baked brie dish that comes with honey, sliced apples and is dusted with confectioner's sugar, the price of $3.75 during late night is pretty much perfect.  

I find most of their dishes to be just okay hence the 3 star rating.  But it is a deal that you can't beat and they do have a wide selection of beers, the best anywhere in oakland i believe.  Its a perfect place for college students without a lot of cash, but sometimes I wonder how they make money when most of their customers can't even drink.  

There is always a long wait at the beginning of late night at 11pm and also beef and fish are exempt from their half off deal.  

Another dish I always go to is their chicken or veggie quesadilla.  I'm surprised that I haven't tried all of their dishes by now, their pizza is mediocre as well.  

If you end up here on any day the baked brie appetizer is the dish to check out, its the dish that sticks out like a sore thumb on their menu and it willl blow you away for the price, they would charge 15 bucks or more in ny for a similar dish.  

their sweet potato fries are ok, the plus is that there is no upcharge for them, at least as of the last time i went i believe."}
{"text":"We really liked this! Typical college bar with really great buffalo chicken dip. It's absolutely what you'd expect a college restaurant to be. The Hog Heaven was amazing"}
{"text":"Good for a hangover.  It's a little loud however.  I've thrown up in the bathroom many times, not due to the food.

The fries are thin and kind of disappointing.  The food is good.  Not spectacular. It's decent.  The specialty drinks are strong, and that's a plus."}
{"text":"The waitress stole my credit card information. I'll leave it at that."}
{"text":"An Oakland classic.  I stopped in to watch some football on. Sunday afternoon.  There was a nice variety of craft beers on tap, and bartender Chelsea was very helpful in steering me to some wise choices.  They had a ice selection of bottles,  too, but those will wait for another visit.  There was also an impressive selection of whiskeys - just one of those for me.
As for food, I went for the 'build your own' section of the menu. Nice idea - I got the sausage with some interesting toppings (interesting to me, anyway). Sandwich comes with a mix of regular and sweet potato fries, I prefer the regular only, and there was no problem with that.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Large selection of beer and whiskeys. Food is a hit or miss it seems like. My husband and I were here with two of our friends and although everyone else's food was a miss, mine was a total hit! I ordered the Smashed Potato pizza and it was so darn good. It's like a pierogi pizza but better. The bacon was salty, the lettuce added freshness, tomatoes were sweet, onions added some zing and then topped with a tangy and creamy ranch dressing. Such well-balanced flavors. Unfortunately, I was the only one to really enjoy my meal. My counterparts ordered meatloaf, a meatloaf sandwich and a crab cake sandwich. Folks, don't get the meatloaf here (and I don't know why it was picked by two members of our party). The meatloaf basically was a grilled salisbury steak. The crab cake sandwich was okay, but you'll have better. I'd say this is a good place to drink and to order drinking food (like pizza), but don't venture and get something you wouldn't normally drink with."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the beer is the fuel and the food is the fuddle or the other way around but it doesn't matter. Both are friggin' awesome!! Got there around 9 on a Sunday night and the crowd was just right. We took two spots at the bar. The bartender Amy was awesome.  She knows her beers and  doesn't let your glass sit empty without checking in.
We shared the smashed potato pizza and the chipotle polka.  Both were delicious.  
The pizza surprised us with some salad ingredients on top and they really make it great.  The potato is perfect with the crunchy crust.
The chipotle polka definitely has some heat and spice.  Nothing crazy but a nice kick.  The pierogies were delicious just melting in your mouth.

I had a good variety of beers from the tap and everything was great and as advertised by our bartender.
We were even able to get a good old Miller Lite from the cooler for a traditional beer and a shot to top off the night."}
{"text":"We have ate here two years in a row while working in town. It was pretty good. Lots of different beer choices.  Had the pork sandwich and pizza.  Both were good.  Seating is kind of rough it you have more than 4."}
{"text":"One of my favorite late-night spots in Pittsburgh. Great selection of American fare and DELICIOUS appetizers. Half-off 11pm-1am, you can't beat it. (Make sure you come early to get your name on the list before the late night rush.) Some musts: Zen Wraps, any of the pizzas (minus the margarita which I found to be pretty disappointing for a basic), and the sweet potato fries!!! You can ask for sweet potato fries only instead of the mix that usually comes on the side of the entrees. Sandwiches are good... especially the braided bread they come on but I'm usually more satisfied after ordering multiple appetizers or pizza (also try the baked brie if you like cheese). Salads are a hit or miss depending on when you order them. Their honey mustard is pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Fuel and Fuddle will always hold a steady spot in my heart. The atmosphere is very \"college-like\"--loud and obnoxious. There is a bar and TV's with the latest sports update. The lighting is kind low and dark, but that sets the mood I guess. I love going here for half off specials (after 11pm). The wait could be kind of long during the weekend for half off, but so worth the wait. Get there a little earlier to secure your seats on the waiting list. 

This place serves your typical All-American grilled and fried dishes. Oh yeah did I mention half off after 11pm? Let me say it again: HALF OFF AFTER 11pm. As a college student living on a budget, I take advantage of this every weekend. Their portions are huge and with the half off special, you could probably order like THREE dishes for approximately $12. Can't beat that. 
 
My favorite thing here is their sweet potato fries. I get it every time I'm at Fuel and Fuddle...the crispiness is truly an addiction. Some other favorites: rosemary chicken breast sandwich, cold turkey sandwich, and skinny buffalo dip. The sandwiches and dips are perfect every time. The wings, however, are a hit or miss. The last time I had the wings, they were really dry. Not a huge fan of the wings. 

Overall, I highly recommend Fuel and Fuddle if you're in the Oakland area late at night and looking for an opportunity to feast like a king with the budget of a peasant."}
{"text":"My son, a student a Pitt, took me here for a quick dinner. I have to say it was a pleasant surprise. The food was excellent! The atmosphere is quite fun, and the decorations are cute. A real find."}
{"text":"One of my college favorites. Although they have changed the menu over the years I still love the Veg head. Their fries are different than they used to be 10 years ago but if you didn't visit then you wouldn't know any different and would still think they are delicious. I recommend going when school is not in session for less of a wait. No complaints otherwise!"}
{"text":"meh. nothing too special but definitely not bad (and trust me, there is some BAD food here in pittsburgh. blegh. they just survive off of poor students unfortunately)

anyway i came here for their half of food late at night, but unfortunately got something that wasn't half off (i think its a pizza? maybe?) but also had some other dish that was half off. not bad, not great. just come for cheap food."}
{"text":"Ah, Fuel & Fuddle. Fuel & Fuddle was one of my college dining favorites - but since I'm no longer a student, I wondered when I stopped in today if the place would be as good as I remembered. It was - woo!

A friend and I came by for dinner after a day at the museums, and as previous Pitt students the noise and collection of young diners didn't surprise us - we just got our seat and raised our voices so we could hear each other as we talked. While looking at the menu I was surprised by how many beers and ciders and whatnot they offered; the last time I ate here I was under 21, so I didn't remember this at all. I saw that the portobello sandwich I'd eaten here previously was still on the menu (ah, good times), but figured it would be nice to try a few other things. So my friend and I each ordered a burger (his made with regular beef, mine a black bean patty) and decided to split their Rollafatty.

The Rollafatty appetizer is basically two mini pepperoni rolls, served with a side of sauce. Very greasy, very cheesy, and very yummy - I'm glad I split it, though. Then our main courses came out on that were plates 100% covered by our food. I think the burgers were pretty standard restaurant sized burgers, and the other half of our plates were full with a mix of regular and sweet potato fries. The fries, while a bit salty, were absolutely delicious; so was my black bean burger, the Garden Of Eat'n. I love black bean sandwiches and appetizers in general, and this one was covered in pesto sauce and mixed with other burger toppings - very yummy! I loved what I ate but ultimately left with about a third of my sandwich and most of my fries (plus my friend's - he didn't want them), as neither of us could finish our entire meals. I doubt we could have even if we skipped the Rollafatty appetizer.

Graduate or not, I'm definitely still a fan of Fuel & Fuddle - it's not fine dining but it's good pub-restaurant (burgers, sandwiches, pizzas, salads, etc.) and they have a great selection of drinks, and the service is generally really quick given the crowds they bring in. Of course, if you stop in while school's in session you will have to share your eating space with students - so as long as you're ok with that, I recommend stopping in to eat here sometime. The sweet potato fries alone are worth it!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. Better than typical bar food. They charge a arm and a leg. Its always busy, but thats oakland for you. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Avoid! Now I know why all of the positive reviews said great late night place. You need to have a drunken buzz to enjoy the food. We were 0 for 4 on dinners. BBQ chicken pizza crust was burned and lacked flavor. The pulled pork was dried out, tough and lacked taste. Buffalo Mac n cheese was too thick tasted like they just dumped Frank's Red Hot Sauce in. Lastly, the jerk chicken was too jerky. Waitress took our order and didn't check on us or offer to get more drinks."}
{"text":"fun room upstairs. We were seated downstairs which smelled weird. We just tried the pizzas which were too doughy and bland for my taste. Would go back and try other items. and sit up top."}
{"text":"Nice beer selection, but the food is terrible.  We had a party of three.  The pizza crust was mushy and seemed as if they made hours before and reheated it.  Chicken chilli had more onions than chicken.  The portobello sandwich had some thing hard in it.  Service was quick but not nice.  Go to drink beer and eat somewhere else.  Not good!!!!"}
{"text":"i got the bbq pulled pork fire kissed quesadilla yesterday to go and a side of sweet potato fries and my friend got the charred charlie. 

the quesadilla was really good; nice bbq flavor and the pork falling apart and cheesy goodness, topped off with a nice sturdy tortilla. the edge pieces were crunchy and the center 2 were more soft so you kinda get a full experience also i don't know why but it tasted good dipped in the salsa too. 

the sweet potato fries were also really fantastic!! not sure what the seasoning is but i'm addicted. also tasted great with the salsa. 

my friend said the charred charlie had a tad bit too much wasabi for his liking and enough soy sauce to feed a small family (alarming considering we both put soy sauce in everything) but it could just be because of the way the takeout container was. 

portion sizes and flavors were great overall, loses a star for my friend's sodium intake levels and the servers were not very interested in helping with the takeout order!!"}
{"text":"Overall, had a really good experience. I was visiting for business and, flying solo, decided to cozy up to the bar for the evening.

After a quick glance at the menu, I appreciated the different types of beers being broken down into subsections as I'm not a beer connoisseur so that helped me with my selections.

I started out with a Rollafatty for my appetizer. When the two fatties (food) came out, they were extremely hot and came with a side dish of marinara sauce. Each was filled with a large amount of cheddar cheese and an average amount of small sliced pepperonis. They were crisp on the outside but weren't dry on the inside due to the immense amount of cheese. Beware, these were extremely greasy but oh so good!

I ordered the c'mon iwana leiya for my main entree which is a Hawaiian Pizza. The crust was thin, golden brown and a good mix of crunchy and chewy. The pizza tasted fresh... Not like it was frozen or premade hours before. It was a good size for a single serving.

I finished my third and final beer with a nutter butter pie. It was rich in peanut butter flavor but not overpowering.

Throughout the night, different people came to the bar that I was able to chat with. You could tell some were regulars while others were there for business or conferences. A good evening of trying different beers and eating a very satisfying meal!"}
{"text":"We first went to Fuel & Fuddle two days ago, the food and service were excellent. We went back tonight (3/14/2015). Apparently if you ask to be moved because a child is out of control next to you, your food and service suffer.
The burger I ordered medium was medium rare, the fries and burger were cold. Our server was indifferent to anything she was too busy eating her own food and drinking her soda to be bothered to ask if I wanted a refill. Oh and she spent a good five minutes talking to a customer she knew. When I complained to the male host he didn't care at all."}
{"text":"Tried chicken wings and sweet potato fries. The wings are not tender enough, but the flavor is great. Love the fries. So crunchy and slightly sweet."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere - fun and light! Try their late night menu! Brews are always on point and half off food for late night is a STEAL! One of my faves in Pittsburgh for sure!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing to get on the menu is the smashed potato pizza. It  tastes like a pierogies. I also like their draft list and their service. My boyfriend and I like to go their for a late dinner on weeknights and it isn't busy at all. It does get packed on the weekends."}
{"text":"This is my pregame Pitt basketball stop.  You have to get there early becasue it gets crowded in a hurry.  My usual is the bufflao wings and the chicken chipotle chili.  The wings have a good flavor and are crispy, which is the way I like them.  The chilli is solid, but nothing special.  The beer selection is above average, but not extraordinary."}
{"text":"Would definitely recommend anyone new to the Pittsburgh area to try this out! It's great for dinner or if you're drunk at 12am and want quality food. 

My friends and I got the skinny dip (buff chix dip) which was amazing, the smashed potato pizza which was also amazing and someone got the jive burger (turkey burger) which again was really good. Lao the sweet potato fries are a must try!!!"}
{"text":"TRY THE CHIPOTLE POLKA (But it's huge so share with someone... or dont). 

We came here for some food after a night out and it was cool. The food wasn't healthy and didn't necessarily taste like super great quality. But it hit the spot and the leftovers were great for breakfast the next day. We also ordered some goat cheese pizza dish, wasnt a huge fan of that one. They also had a promotion going with DASH, so our meal was basically $0  (not including tip obviously)."}
{"text":"Recently visited for the first time with friends and really enjoyed it. The pierogi appetizer was magnificent, as was my crabby patty sandwich. Lots of choices and everyone liked what they got. Will definitely be back to try new dishes here. Great hours, as well. I like that I can stop for a late dinner when I'm working. Loud!! in the evening."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous food. The ambiance makes it feel like you are a part of the history of the city. And the Half off menu is great!!"}
{"text":"Very very good pizza. I'm epically inpressed with the quality here. However, because of the ridiculously high price for a personal sized pizza (which was exactly the size of a normal plate one would have in the household), i wanted to give it a 3.5 but round up because how good the pizza was. The crust is crunchy and extremwly thin, i'm absolutely in love! Would recommend the Florentine."}
{"text":"I actually really enjoyed this place!  Just grabbed lunch here and ate the Baby Got Back Phat Wrap. I thought it was pretty good. This place seems to get a ton of haters, maybe for the nighttime atmosphere (?) but I work at Pitt so I'm a \"grown up\" and thought this was a decent place to grab a quick bite. 

The only reason I give them 4 stars is because I thought the staff was a little intimidating and it was super dark for a lunch at noon. Maybe if there was a little more lighting for daytime activities!"}
{"text":"I love how they had their happy hour sometimes really late at night after studying. Their food is really actually great. I have no complaints. And happy hour prices are amazing!"}
{"text":"I only get the smashed potato pizza here, and it is delicious. I love the combination of the mashed potatoes and buttermilk ranch dressing, which is surprisingly great. Mostly bar food, and they have late night specials (half off!) Parking can be tough in Oakland, especially around this place."}
{"text":"I've been here before and it's been fantastic... however today they had an off day... my holy guacamole salad (normally bomb) had way too much dressing on it and the burger was burnt.

The server we had (I won't put her name on the internet because that's mean) forgot to mention to the cook no tomatoes and mayo on my girlfriend's wrap. I had to ask three times for my beer and, lastly, she asked if we wanted our appetizer before our meal... hmmmm yes of course haha...

Should be two stars... three because we got a fortune cookie lol"}
{"text":"Come past 11 for half off, food is american dishes and are pretty satisfactory their buff chicken dip and smashed potato pizza are popular choices. The atmosphere is pretty good but being a college favorite especially around 11 the place gets quite loud. For larger parties they can accommodate with downstairs seating."}
{"text":"Really good food and great beer!  Every time I go here I have the same thing: sirloin burger and railbender beer.  The burgers are huge and the fries are plentiful (both potato and sweet potato).  I always have to ask for lettuce and tomato but that's fine by me.

Oh boy.... the railbender!  I literally went on a bender the first time I had this beer.  It only takes two my friends, only two.  I didn't know how drunk I was till I fell down in broad daylight.  sigh

Railbender tastes like Bass but even better.  Who would think two beers would cause so much trouble!?  Love it."}
{"text":"Most people seem to love this place, but just did not mesh for me.  It was a bit too crowded and loud for eating dinner.

If you're a student, you may really like this place.  For a young professional like me, it was too college.

Food was tasty, but ambience was not."}
{"text":"This place isn't the worst, but it certainly is not the best. 
Fuel and Fuddle definitely caters to the college crowd with their low key vibes, dim lighting, and loud music. The atmosphere was pretty relaxed but you could tell you were in a college town bar/restaurant. 

The beer selection is stellar with a wide variety of craft beers on tap. The food is average bar food - nothing remarkable to report. A friend and I came in on a Thursday night before heading to a Pitt game and were seated immediately. We shared the nachos with pulled pork and while we finished the plate, they weren't our favorites nachos we've ever ate. F&F does not do nacho cheese so it was just shredded cheese melted over a plate of nachos with cold toppings thrown on at the end. The pulled pork was the best thing on the plate, so I'd recommend just getting their pulled pork sandwich. 

Would I come back to Fuel and Fuddle? Sure, if I was grabbing a beer before a game. But I have no intention to add it to my rotation of bar/restaurants."}
{"text":"Great bar with good food. Stay away from the crab cakes, but the pizzas and salads are very good. One of the better beer selections in Oakland. Try the BIG fish sandwich.."}
{"text":"Bad food.  Bad service (got 2 of our orders wrong and gave us attitude for asking it to be corrected).  Great location.  Good beer specials.  Small TVs."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about 13 years at this point, so it's probably time to share how I feel about it!

The menu is great, with something for pretty much everyone. (Especially when you come in after 11pm, at which point nearly everything becomes half-price!) The beer selection is even better. And on Sundays, they have one of my favorite brunches in town. The \"sausage egg-stacy sandwich,\" with its Breadworks roll and gooey provolone, is my personal Kryptonite. (If Superman couldn't stop eating Kryptonite -- so maybe it's more like my personal crack.)

The service can be a little hit and miss -- partly this is because the servers are all quite young and this is a super-crowded place, almost all the time, and also partly because it's a college hangout, and sorry to be ageist, but college freshmen tend to gum up the fine-tuned gears of any restaurant they enter. However, from time to time you will also get something a little overcooked from the wood-fire grill. I've had nachos that were a bit scorched in the past, for instance. (95% of the time, though, they totally rule.)

All told, this is an absolutely worthy place to have a meal. I thought that at 18, and I think that at 30. (And from an anthropological perspective, it's a damned interesting place to people watch.)"}
{"text":"Delicious multi meat hang over burger with tasty sweet potato fries. Enjoyed the food and environment althought we had yo yell as a group to hear each other."}
{"text":"Coming from Jacksonville, FL we had heard this was a comparable spot to some of the bars in our King Street district. F&F was small, with only 10 beers on draft. I had expected at least a dozen or two beers.

It has a nice vibe and we sat up at the bar, but it's really nothing special. It's fine to stop in if you're nearby for a cold beer but don't go out of your way."}
{"text":"Fuel is one of my top choices for weekend brunch in Pittsburgh. Their (free, unlimited, typically good) coffee and twists on the classics make a great choice for one or ten. If you come in with ten, you may want to call ahead to get the less noisy basement tables, no matter what time of day. Brunch is the best, in my opinion, as Fuel transforms from a noisy, dark college restaurant to a calmer, lighter atmosphere. Also they have specials on bloody marys.

Half-price starts at 11 pm, and includes about 65% of the menu. Like all half-price in Oakland establishments you will see a line unless it's a school break or you're there 30 minutes early. It's worth the wait though for delicious food. I'm a fan of their salads, but their pizzas are pretty excellent also. Desserts, like the apple burnover (think huge brick oven baked apple turnover with vanilla ice cream), are quite enough for two.

Beer selection is fantastic, and conveniently laid out for you in the menu, prices and all. If you go there for the drinking, be sure to get some crab dip. You will not regret it. Unless you have an allergy."}
{"text":"I ordered the Florentine Pizza + roasted red pepper from Fuel & Fuddle through Grub Hub's delivery service.  The pizza came within an hour and was DELICIOUS!  The goat cheese was sprinkled throughout which made it that much tastier.  The pizza was light and did not make me feel bogged down like some pizzas can.  I will be ordering from here again.  Too bad there's no chance of getting a few beers delivered along with the pizza."}
{"text":"This place would probably have gotten a higher rating had I gone to the actual location. The takeout was just alright. my veggie burger was actually pretty good once heated up a bit. they messed up on both side orders for the two meals and messed up on the requests for the turkey burger. the turkey burger was just OK, pretty plain and very well done. again I could imagine the food being done as we ordered and hot from the kitchen and it may have been a knockout. delivery just didn't do it. I'll be back to try again in house!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan. I always leave disappointed.

I'm a draft beer drinker. They have a good selection, but everyone seems to at this point.

My problem is the food. It is just eh. They have the wood fired oven, which is nice. I guess I don't understand the large crowds. The food is good, but not that good.  I guess I prefer Hemingway's for standard bar food or The Porch for upscale bar food."}
{"text":"How I missed coming here on the regular.  Things happen for a reason and I am happy they happen the way they did.  My time away from being a regular here has made me appreciate it more than before.

It's still crowded, it's still small in size, and it's still as loud as can be.  But that does not deter me from entering, as it should not deter you.  The food is just as good as I can remember too.  Even though it had been some time since I dined here, I still ended up getting my old reliable.  The Befuddling Sirloin Burger is still as befuddling as I remember.  The 100 proof bourbon BBQ sauce is just enough on this sandwich that I never need to top it with anything else.  Their burgers are amazing, not a traditional patty in any sense.  It's not round, it's like it was round then they decided to take a rolling pin to it and elongated it.  Good thing they did too, to fit the bun they put it on, it cannot be round.  The bread sometimes puts it over the top and really makes it a gut buster.  Also, I didn't need any other side than their handful of russet and sweet potato fries, a great compliment to a great sandwich.  

My friends decided to both have the 1/2 rack ribs.  Smothered in the same BBQ sauce as my burger made it just as mouth watering.  They put all that deliciousness on top of a bed of what looked like grilled veges.  A really nice mixture I am told.  They also top this off with a handful of the mixed fries.

The price takes a bit out of the pocket, but it is totally worth it.

*a few notes about this place: parking is horrible (read as: be prepared to circle the block, or take the hit to use a garage), best to call ahead to get a table at peak hours or sit at the bar, if you don't want to wait visit one of it's sister eateries right next door, delivery available through Wheel Deliver for a few dollars more."}
{"text":"Best burger meat ever... and very interesting burger recipes too. Their fire oven pizza is also delicious. If you like beer, there's a zillion options for that too!"}
{"text":"The three of us went to this place during their half price menu time. 

The interior was well-lit, with graffiti on the walls giving it a little rustic yet inviting feel. We ordered Fire-kissed Quesadilla, Classic Veg Head, Chipotle Polka and the Cajun Chicken Sandwich (which I cannot find on the menu for some reason). They also have an array of beers to choose from. 

The Fire-kissed Quesadilla was mouth-watering, veg head was good and the cajun sandwich, even though a tad chewy, was lip-smacking. The Chipotle Polka was nothing but a few pierogies deep-fried in oil. Though oily, it was delicious. For dessert, we ordered the Big-Ass Brownie. It was both 'big-ass' as well as devilishly good. It was the kind of dessert which you would eat and immediately feel guilty about. 

Even though the food quality wasn't the best, it was clearly value-for-money because of the half -price thing. I would recommend everyone to visit this place and especially try the brownie which definitely lives up to its name."}
{"text":"In Pitt for work, so I'm just here to explore the chicken. Got here at nighttime with a party of four

Service - I didn't really keep note of that.
The waitress was weirded out it seemed cause none of my party of four wanted any of their damn beers.

Chicken is my beer,

- blackened Chicken Wrap was AMAZING.
- The fries that came with it was LEGENDARY. They give you half regular fries and half sweet potato. Their sweet potato fries are the best I ever had. They are seasoned well and melt in your mouth.

Like I always say if you don't need  ketchup for the fries to taste good, you have an excellent fry.

Just like if you don't need beer to appear exciting or humorous, you have an excellent personality.

My party had some other stuff that I don't remember but they loved it. Let's just say we enjoyed our food hangover afterwords. It's like the itis but we're not sleepy.

The atmosphere was great dim and grungy."}
{"text":"Nothing nastier than seeing one of the cooks not wearing a hairnet or gloves while he is preparing your food. I watched this guy wipe his sweaty head four times while preparing food. That has to be one of the nastiest hygiene practices I've seen in a kitchen. DISGUSTING"}
{"text":"Fuel is filled with a variety of people.  The lunch crowd consists of an eclectic mix of professionals, students and locals.  Anytime after lunch and you're in for mostly the undergraduate/grad student crowd.

The menu is quite varied.  Appetizers, salads, pizzas and sandwiches line the pages with funny names like, \"Rosemary's breasts\" (a delicious chicken sandwich, recommended with the cajun mayo, lettuce and tomato - you need to ask) and \"Rolla fatty\" (a pepperoni roll with mozzarella baked in...delicious). I also recommend the house salad with apples and walnuts.  Stay away from the chili and most of the \"large plates.\"  I don't think they sell enough of them to remember to prepare them properly.

Good food (mostly). HORRIBLE for conversation.  This place is built entirely from painted cinder block = no noise absorption whatsoever!  Fuel always proves good for a young crowd during a sporting event but I would NEVER bring a date here...ever.  

Great for college kids, they offer a 1/2 price menu on most items after 11.  It was great when I was in school.  Things get really tight in there though.  They have a great beer menu - one of the best in Pittsburgh.  I would give it 3.5 stars if I could.  You average, without alcohol, about $10-12 per person after tax."}
{"text":"The best late night food in Pittsburgh. The food is good, it tends toward fried and salty but that's fine. Portions are ridiculous. I love mustard, and by far the best mustard I've ever had was here. The pizzas are done well in a brick oven. But even if you hate everything else, the beers alone are worth the trip."}
{"text":"Very good food, pretty poor service.  Atmosphere is nice, but not amazing.  A solid choice in restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here late at night in order to get the really cheap food. The idea is perfect, especially in Pittsburgh where very few places are open very late. Sweet potato fries are one of my favorite indulgences, and they were the sole reason that I came here. They did not disappoint. The next time I come I would like to try the black bean veggie burger. Apparently this is a hot spot for Pitt students and has a very young and hip and happening atmosphere. Will most likely return."}
{"text":"Love the pizzas here - smashed potato is my favorite (just add bacon) and the roll a fatty is pepperoni heaven."}
{"text":"College bar in Oakland. Since school is out now is a good time if you wanted some bar grub and a beer. The serve the standard wings, fries, and pies. I tried the alligator stew served with mashed potatoes. 

Check it out if you're ever in Oakland."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the atmosphere here and the food/service was above mediocre but nothing incredible. Unique bar food that wouldn't quite entice Guy Fieri. I had a quesadilla and it was lovely but not quite filling, the food is also on the pricier side."}
{"text":"Great place to go for food anytime of the day or night.  Their pizzas are really great and have many different unique kinds like the \"smashed potato pizza\"

For this past trip I only went to drink, but that is okay because they have many many kinds of beer.  I found out that they now also have two different kinds of house beer on tap.  I tried the brown ale and thought it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Go for the late night menu or else it's not really worth it. Mostly everything on the late night $6 menu is delicious!! (Besides pizza...their pizzas aren't good). My favorites are the buffalo chicken dip, chipotle polka pierogies, the hog heaven and their sweet potato fries. Also really great beer selection, perfect place to try a new beer you haven't had before!"}
{"text":"I'm giving Fuel & Fuddle 1 star for each goal I saw the US Women's Soccer Team score in the final during the 20 minutes between ordering my meal and finishing it.  The goals didn't really affect my review, but it certainly made dining here even more enjoyable. I was staying nearby, and F&F was one of several interesting places for dinner within walking distance of the hotel, and we deemed this one most interesting. I think it's a stretch to call it a gastropub, it's more like a tavern edging towards gastropub. 

The menu is outstanding and well organized, especially the beer by type - though I'd rather actually see a bit more about the beers such as where they are from. Without that, I was still happy to settle for a Great Lakes Eliot Ness amber lager. 

Normally at a place like this, I would order a burger. But since I had had one for lunch, I instead opted for a bowl of the chicken chili and a side of southern slaw. The chili was lukewarm temperature-wise, but it had what I felt was a just-right amount of spicy warmth. The slaw was fresh and I'm pretty sure homemade, but I found nothing about it which made it \"southern.\"   One of the other people at my table let me sample his hamburger - delicious, I'd definitely order one here - and it came with not just regular but sweet potato fries as well. The sweet potato fries have a sugary coating. 

Service here is very casual, but we were checked on frequently - just the right amount for a place in a \"college area.\" If I were living in the area or attending school here, I'd dine here often."}
{"text":"My family recently went here for my sister birthday. There was 7 of us. The place reminds me of a cool diner. Many craft beers, and cocktails. The food was very good also. I had some wings which were cooked perfectly. Everyone got something different to eat and no one had any complaints. I ended up getting the Alligator Stew. It was pretty spicy, and not what I expected. But I really enjoyed it. My brother got the chicken chili which he also said was very spicy. As a family we like spicy foods, so it wasn't an issue. All around happy table and for a group of 7 with some beers and dinner, our tab was about $125.00"}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent place for bar food.  They have a nice chicken breast sandwich, and oversize nachos.  I have found after eating many a lunch here while I was working nearby, that the quality of the food is a bit inconsistent.  The fries are decent and you can ask for a garlic aioli for them.  My wife would probably give them an additional star because she really like the sweet potato fries.  One good thing about this place is that it is great for a mixed group with lots of food idiosyncracies.  There are a decent number of veggie options, e.g., a mushroom sandwich."}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch. Lots of great menu item choices. Great craft beer selection also."}
{"text":"I didn't go to Pitt - so I hadn't been to Fuel & Fuddle  before. I hit up this local watering hole before the Pitt game on Wednesday night. 

This spot was busy at 7pm - and we got seated in a two person table. It was squeeze between two other tables. I'm not a fan of that - I like to have my own space to catch up and talk openly. But it was definitely aimed at the college crowd. 

To start, I ordered a Apricot wheat beer / it was good. I would get it again.  They had a nice beer selection. 

To share - we ordered the nachos with shredded pork. They were loaded with jalapeños, black olives.  tomatoes, shredded pork, cheese - and topped with a little sour cream. It needed more sour cream - so we did get more. 

To conclude - I won't pass on this place but it definitely wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Went here with friends and family on New Year's Eve.  The food was good, as was the selection of beers.  Ribs, pizza's, pulled pork, steak sandwich, and alligator stew -- all yummy, although the alligator stew was a little heavy on the black pepper.  I guess that's meant to represent the alligator biting back?

I plan to go back again, although I'm told it's usually very crowded.  We had no problem getting in on New Year's Eve, and they did take a reservation.  But we arrived an hour early (~ 7p), and were still seated."}
{"text":"Recently went here to celebrate my brother's 21st birthday. We were in Pittsburgh for the weekend for our first time and we're staying near Pitt. We were looking for a place that our whole family could go to that served food late and was open past 12. Fuel & Fuddle checked all the boxes with a late night food menu and a kitchen that stayed open til 1 and a bar that was open until 2! My whole family was impressed and both my brother and I were saying we wish we had such a great place to go to on our campuses. This place knocked it out of the park. Cheap food and drinks and a fairly extensive menu. Everything we ordered was incredible between the personal pizzas, wings, and wraps and our drinks were equally good. My mom and I opted for cocktails. Only $7 and extremely potent. I got the impala while mom opted for the Monte Carlo. Both really good. Our waitress was super nice and more than helpful to swing by our table again at 12 to serve my brother his first drinks. He ordered one of their whiskeys off of their extensive menu and a corona, only $3.50. All in all such a great place, if you're in the area especially for some late night eats- definitely swing by!"}
{"text":"Good cheap eats, including burgers, pizza, sandwiches, beer, and interesting variations on those themes. Half off food is a must for college students, and as such it can get very crowded. Sweet potato fries are tasty, and the service is competent if a little slow when it gets really busy."}
{"text":"The food here was quite average. I ordered the land and sea which was a steak and shrimp mix. There wasn't a lot. I would suggest if you come here to get one of their hamburgers. Instead, you'll get more food. My meal didn't have anything out of the ordinary. I asked for my steak to me cooked medium, but mine ended up being cooked to well done. So basically it tasted like rubber, but the shrimp was good. The fries. Come mixed with sweet potato and regular. The portions are still smaller than what's usually around Pittsburgh, probably because it caters to the college crowd. There's mostly dim lighting, and and loud music, so I'm assuming that most students go there to socialize. There's also a large selection of alcoholic beverages. It has a very hipster, young grad student sort of a feeling. It's an average place, but I'm not a fan of the atmosphere. I probably don't go again."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt my favorite restaurant in Oakland.  There's tons of variety, great apps, and a decent beer selection.  This place is definitely more restaurant than bar, but the food does not disappoint.  Casual food at great prices--you can't go wrong! PS. Go with the nachos!"}
{"text":"You cant beat the late  night half price! Get the wings! 
One star taken out because all other food i tried is just ok...."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but feel I had to. We ordered delivery through Grub Hub...risky, I know, however I was tired of pizza and felt I could get something different here. I ordered the Havana Burger medium rare. I'd prefer my burger be under than over but this was raw...charred on the outside and totally raw on the inside. It was inedible. Unfortunate because it smelled really good. We also ordered the beer muscles. Another risky delivery order but it came quickly so I had high hopes. The flavor was good but there were 9 unopened mussels...NINE!!  When you have a pound of mussels and you can't even eat NINE of them, you're still hungry!  Paid for a lot of inedible food today and that sucks. 

UPDATE:  I wrote an email to Fuel and Fuddle about my experience and they promptly apologized and are sending a gift card. I'm all about 2nd chances!"}
{"text":"The current 3.5 star rating of Fuel & Fiddle is really fair.  I think it is three star if you go during normal hours and four stars if you go for the late night food specials.

There are so many different beers and whiskeys to choose from here, and I was impressed.  I didn't order anything this trip, but I would definitely consider coming here for late night pizza and whiskey.

Let me start by saying that the menu is massive.  Anyone can find something to eat here.  My friend and I split the Bada Bing ($10) and On the Lamb pizza ($10).  The Bada Bing was a grilled Italian sausage sandwich with sweet peppers, onions, marinara & provolone.  The sandwich was OK, but it was a bit dry.  The pizza had gyro-style lamb and provolone cheese, and was topped with lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumber dill sauce.  It was super unique, but I enjoyed it.  The food was pretty standard and nothing to write home about.

I would come back for the late night $5 pizza special and to drink, but I don't think I would stop back in just for dinner.  The atmosphere is fairly loud, if that deters you."}
{"text":"GOOD LAWD! This place is a college MIRACLE! It's like, an oasis in a desert for the Carnegie Mellon and U. Pittsburgh college kids! HALF OFF (almost) all food! 
With the exception of seafood, steaks, or alcohol but who CARES?! 

Even during the summer session, this place was bustling! I went here almost every night for the first few weeks until I discovered the word \"moderation\" .. needless to say, awesome.

Oh and their humorous blackboard on the right side when you walk in the door got me my first time. Ho ho ho - you so funny, Fuel & Fuddle."}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick easy lunch. The pepperoni roll is small but delicious, just very greasy! The fries are a mix of regular and sweet potato, but you can get just one or the other if you'd like. There appears to be a large beer selection, but I'm currently pregnant so I didn't look at what they offered. I had a steak wrap and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Gotta love Fuel and Fuddle!  Awesome beer selection and consistently good food that doesn't disappoint.  The atmosphere is fun and laid back, and this place really could be franchised."}
{"text":"Fuel & Fuddle has consistently remained on my list of Pittsburgh-restaurants-I-will-randomly-crave for the better part of 10 years.

I started coming here, as all Pitt students do, freshman year, for the luxury of half-price food after 11, and the chance to use our Pitt bucks (which I know have since taken on a different name - the dining dollars on your ID card that let you in to places other than campus eateries).  They could accommodate a group of us without a problem, and I can't think of an occasion where the service has been bad.

I am also a huge, HUGE fan of their brunches.  These are easily the cheapest brunches in the city, with no plates over $8, which includes the cost of your bottomless cup of coffee.  They have breakfast pizza, the best breakfast sandwich in Pittsburgh (the sausage eggstasy sandwich, with two sausage patties, scrambled eggs, cheese, and a lovely bun), and something cleverly titled the 'hangover helper,' which has all the breakfast meat you could ask for, plus beer-battered pancakes.  (PS, it's not just for hangovers, it's also enjoyable post-half-marathon, as we discovered this May!)

The prices at Fuel & Fuddle are so reasonable, even before half-price time starts, and they've stayed pretty much the same since I first started going back in 2001.  They have a great beer selection, if you're into that sort of thing (they even have a beer club where you can attempt to drink 100+ different varieties for a chance at having your name on a little plaque on the wall).

I highly recommend the nachos - this is the thing that brings us back late at night many a time.  They're baked in the brick ovens with real cheese melted right on top, and big chunks of juicy tomatoes strewn throughout.  You can even add chili to the nachos for a little more bite!

Other great menu items include the pizzas (also baked in the brick ovens, and personal-sized, although you may have a piece or two left to take home with you) and the grilled psychedelic, their portabella mushroom sandwich.  The dive diner fries are crispy, perfectly-seasoned waffle fries, and they come on a plate big enough to feed the full party at your table.

Some notes: during the school year (Sept - beginning of May), crowds can be bad at half-price.  If you're over 21, my advice is to get there shortly before (they won't seat anyone for just half-price until 11 itself) and order your drink.  The awesome waitstaff will wait to put your food order in until the clock hits 11, and then you won't be so pressed to find a seat.

There is a small section of the menu that is not half-price, but it's clearly labeled so you're aware.  

Brunch is 11-2 on Sundays, and on Steeler game days especially, it can get crowded.  We always try to get there just after 11 to get a table.

Downstairs, they have a large seating section that can accommodate groups.  I hosted the NaNoWriMo kick-off party there one year, and they put up with us bringing our laptops while enjoying our brunch.  Just call in advance if you know you're having a huge party (I know Pitt has also hosted writing program reading events here from time to time).

Parking is the only truly chancey thing about this place, but they're right on a bus line, and if you live in Oakland or the surrounding areas, just walk over.  You're guaranteed to want to eat a lot, so mightaswell get your exercise in ahead of time :)"}
{"text":"Another Oakland staple, Fuel & Fuddle is the go-to gastropub for Pitt students. Fuel's vibe is meant to appeal to the college student's \"indulgent\" tendencies. Menu items names like \"rollafatty,\" \"rump shaker,\" and \"grilled psychedelic\" all play into this theme; not to mention the blatant \"Route 420\" painted on the wall. Food-wise, pizzas, sandwiches, wings, and their signature mixed sweet potato/traditional fries will absolutely satisfy your cravings, regardless of whether or not those cravings were influenced by any botanical studies you and your friends conducted beforehand. Pitt isn't a STEM school for nothing, amiright?

With over 100 drink options, Fuel is a great place for new and old alcohol fans to try new beers and such. The low price late night menu begins after 11PM; I've spent countless nights chowing down here with my friends. I've noticed that the food quality goes down at 11PM: fries are dry from sitting outside the fryer, pizza crusts can get more burnt, turkey burger is not formed as well as it should be, etc. Regardless, it's still delicious and totally worth it: you get what you pay for at that hour."}
{"text":"Fuel & Fuddle is a favorite among college kids in the area, and I am no exception. Late night is fantastic: featuring all the greasy foods we crave at night for great prices. Fuel & Fuddle is also a great place to meet up with friends, especially if you can get a table in the basement where it's quieter. 
The only thing I don't love about this place is the noise level and sometimes the food quality suffers on really busy nights- but more than 95% of my experiences have been phenomenal."}
{"text":"As a Pitt grad, Fuel and Fuddle has always been one of  my staples.  It may not be the best restaurant in Oakland but they have a great selection of food and beers and they served sweet potato fries long before they were popular.  My favorite item on the menu is the smashed potato pizza.  Who knew that mashed potatoes, chicken, ranch, lettuce and tomato on a pizza could be so tasty?   I was dubious at first but there is something about it that works so well.  I'd recommend any of the brick oven pizzas.  If you're there after 11PM, food is half off but it gets really crowded at that time especially during the School year.   

If you come just for drinks, you'll find that the bar area is pretty small.  They also have a downstairs area that can accomodate larger groups ."}
{"text":"Whenever you have a spot to run to with a nice selection of beer, good food and a decent atmosphere, you have to keep going. 
A friend of mine is or was a regular at this spot, and when a friend was celebrating being something over 30, he took over the basement for Jeopardy and I hate to say it, but I ran that mother and my team was in the lead the whole time. 
But wait! There's more... they had some very impressive grub, and the waitress kept her cool even though she was weaving in and out of a very thirsty crowd of about 20 members of this private party. She kept her cool, and hats off to her. 
I mosied on up the stairs to see what was happening above ground, and it was pretty good. I think they might become a part of my regular stop-throughs when I am in town."}
{"text":"Small bar in Oakland, Fuel and Fuddle is crowded on Pitt basketball game days. They have an extensive beer selection and so-so food."}
{"text":"I've never been to F&F for the late night half price food but have been there a couple times for dinner and drinks. The beer selection is awesome. I personally love the fire-baked brie which comes out nice and warm and has honey drizzled all over it. When you cut the breading, the cheese just melts out. I'm a big fan of the Porky's Revenge Pizza and the Filler Up pizza.  The burgers are decent and I usually get the sweet potato fries with them because they are so much better than regular fries. Overall, a good place to eat. If you do want to go for half price late night special, make sure you get there early because there is usually a line outside."}
{"text":"Used to frequent here in college, and just went back a few weeks ago.  Menu is still super legit and reasonably priced.  The veggie burger patty is really great and made in house.  Their different aiolis are also all wonderful.  I love that they have cocktails in pint glasses!  Still a great place for some comfort food and boozing."}
{"text":"Fuel and Fuddle stands out when it comes to quick and easy \"bar food\". Apps, burgers, and beer are definitely their specialty. I had a byo burger, that had dozens of topping choices, which is awesome. Something to note however, my burger came with both sweet potato fries and regular fries (little weird). My dad had a one of F&F's pizzas which was decent, but not the best. Another food group to note is the apps, I had the nachos and the pierogis, both outstanding. If you aren't a cheese person the nachos may not be for you. I would definitely recommend the pierogis though. Along with the food, our waitress for the night was nothing short of fantastic. She was attentive and knew her stuff when it came to the menu and the beers. You could tell she's tried the food and drinks and led you down the right path. 

Next, the ambiance is very casual. The sound level is on the higher side, but it's all within the range of the type of place Fuel and Fuddle is. 

Overall, Fuel and Fuddle has excellent bar food, and with my experience a great waitress. I would definitely recommend F&F to anyone in down town Pittsburgh. It's a great place."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, most recently Nov. of last year.  Fuel and Fuddle is one of those restaurants you go to expecting to have a great time, and that you'll enjoy the food because of that (ahem, Mad Mex).  While the food here is decent, I wouldn't say that it's anything to write home about, in particular.  The smashed potato pizza is pretty good, esp. with rosemary chicken on top, as are the \"skinny\" dip, nachos, and sweet potato fries.  I really think people come here to drink, more than anything else.  I'm not a beer drinker, so I can't comment on the beer (which is what most people seem to order), but some of their mixed drinks are interesting.  They have one that's mint flavored that I especially enjoy (forget what it's called)--but then again, I'm one of those weirdos who enjoys mint-flavored drinks (cf. my review on Union Pig and Chicken).  Overall, a fun place to come with a group or a few friends to get some drinks and munchies, but don't expect gastropub-quality eats."}
{"text":"A staple on my Pittsburgh food rotation, especially when I lived in Oakland. It would get 3 stars if it wasn't for their half-price late night special which brings the food to a price that is so ridiculously cheap that it feels almost wrong. Plus a great beer selection--I loooove their house Fire Brick Brown Ale, brewed by Smuttynose.

Favorite things on the menu: Wings (seriously addictive bleu cheese, but unfortunately no celery), amazing sweet potato fries, and the Chipotle Polka--spicy mini-pierogies loaded with cheese, bacon, carmelized onions, and sour cream.

Avoid: The burgers are terrible, which is weird since they share ownership with Burgatory. Also not a fan of the too-sweet pizza dough.

Go before the half-price special starts at 11pm to put your name in for a table, or be prepared for a loooooong wait among lots of undergrads."}
{"text":"Fuel & Fuddle always seems to be crowded, whether it's lunch, dinner, late night, or summer. It's a very typical college town local bar kind of establishment. That said, the space is a bit too tight for my tastes--tables are situated pretty close to each other, and conversations are loud. Service can be a hit or miss, as it's always so busy in there. 

Food is pretty decent; they have a long menu and lots of sandwiches, burgers, and plates, as well as small bites. Somewhat pricey, but they do have late night, which is great for the area. Overall a fine stop if you are looking for the right atmosphere."}
{"text":"Go after 11pm for the half priced food and experience one of the best bar-food menus in Pittsburgh. The sweet-potato fries are the best I've ever had, the pizzas are always good, and the sandwiches are big. When I go I mostly order off of the appetizer menu.  Never had a bad time here, but if you aren't there at 11pm then expect a wait of up to 40 minutes. I've had some people be skeptical when I've said it's worth the wait, but I've never had a complaint once the food came. Also it isn't very expensive before the half-off, so I've been here many times during the day - you just feel kind of bad that you could be getting it for so much less"}
{"text":"What is a fuddle? Nobody knows.  

I hate the name of this place.  It sounds sooooo dumb.  They should re-name it something less dumb-sounding.

I used to call it \"That loud place,\" because I couldn't remember what it's called, and it's really really loud inside.  

Aside from that stuff, though, the experience here is pretty good.  The food quality's pretty decent, the service is usually quick.  A friend of mine swears by the nachos, enough so that he generally won't order them from anywhere else.  

If you don't mind loud (and if you're in Oakland, you better get used to it,) Fuel and Fuddle is just fine.  Except the name.  The name's really stupid."}
{"text":"Fuel and Fuddle never ever disappoints.  Nestled in the urban campus of the University of Pittsburgh, this unpretentious place serves great food, and boasts a down to earth staff that consistently provides great service.  I especially love the pizza, the nachos (with chicken chili), and the \"Goin' cold turkey\" sandwich made with actual real turkey.  Imagine that!  It's a great place that makes you feel young, even if you aren't.  A great selection of beer is yet another reason why I keep coming back to Fuel &Fuddle.  Hungry and don't know where to go?  Run, don't walk, to Fuel & Fuddle.  Do it.  NOW."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent beer, excellent staff. The only bad thing on the menu I have tried is the cucumber salad. 

I particularly recommend their beer mussels appetizer, Ice Ice Baby wrap (shrimp wrap), and naked truth pizza."}
{"text":"Very sad to discover that their signature bread and fries are now just like every other bar. I'm glad they were able to stay open, but, these were the things that made it unique. Bummer that they couldn't maintain that standard."}
{"text":"Another restaurant on our Pittsburgh list of must eats, and was very satisfied!! Our server was very attentive and nice, and the food was amazing! We got the pesto pizza, bbq wings and the hog heaven. The hog heaven was really good and came with a side of a nice horse radish dip and also came with a mix of sweet potato fries as regular fries. The pesto chicken pizza is among my top 10 best pizzas I've ever had! And the wings were flavorful and crispy!! We came for the late night deals and a local recommendation. Would definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Just one word,  Nachos. I am determined to find the best in the Burgh, and this place is on the watch list.  Chicken Chili, fresh jalepenos (they have to be fresh!), sour cream, cheese, sliced black olives.   So good!  My only complaint is no salsa or huac (which I love.) Still they will be in my running to enter best 'chos!  Keep up the good working Fuel, and thanks for refueling me!   (I had to)"}
{"text":"When I went to Pitt, this was an absolute favorite of mine. It was the standard place I would take family or friends when they visited. The food is always delicious, well priced, and never disappointing and the service is always on point even when it's a crazy busy Saturday afternoon. You must start with the wings. Big, meaty, crispy. Just perfect! As far as entrees some of my favorites include Rosemary's Breast, the pulled pork sandwich, or the fried fish sandwich. The pizzas are always great too - thin crispy crust. Or be adventurous and try the alligator stew. Ugh wish I was back in the burgh!"}
{"text":"Just go for a drink. It's a cool environment and the bar is excellent. The food is average and a little pricy; if you do decide to order some, go late-night for the specials!"}
{"text":"One things I miss about being a college student in Pittsburgh is this place. It's hard to find any other city where you get half price and delicious food in large quantities this late at night.

Late night starts from 11pm-1am when the kitchen closes. During this time, mostly everything is half off except for some of the big platters, seafood dishes, and drinks.

Recommendations:
Wings - messy but so good, I always go with the standard buffalo but the other flavors are great too, wings are large, crispy, and juicy.

Dip sticks - Definitely pay that $1 extra and add the mozz. Great rosemary flatbread and marinara sauce. Cheese makes it even better.

Roll-a-fatty - Kind of like a calzone but better because it's half off and you get extra marinara sauce to dip.

Pizzas - A little bigger than a personal pan, but easily finished by one person. I like the Classic Maggie and all the ones with lots of MEAT. My friends always get the Smashed Potato, but I've never liked it since it tastes likes salad on a pizza.

I've never been here not during late night so no idea how it is during normal hours, but it's always been crowded every time I've been here.It's especially crowded on Thurs-Sat. because of all the college students. Don't be surprised with up to an hour's wait. Best time to go though is to get there either around 10:30pm to wait in line for late night to begin, or around 12-12:30pm right before their kitchen closes."}
{"text":"I finally found thin crust pizza in Pittsburgh! No thick, doughy crust! I ordered the Naked Truth. I would have liked a lot more basil and a few more tomatoes, but the crust, sauce and cheese were excellent. They also have a solid local craft beer selection. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Met my college friends at Fuel today. I hadn't been there in over 10 years. The atmosphere was exactly the same, chill, hip, familiar. The food is unique. Our service was good, great beer selection. The nachos were stale but our entrees made up for it. Great food, great atmosphere, great beer."}
{"text":"I was seated immediately upon arrival. Their beer menu was extensive and gave me the option to choose something I had never had before. After drinks I ordered the smashed potato pie. It's was good but it was nothing extraordinary. My one complaint is that when I attempted to go down to the bathroom the urinal was filled with puke. Other than that it was a good low budget meal."}
{"text":"Food: I think I have only gotten wings from this place. Hot Wings, Jerk Wings. I can't recall what other types of wings I have eaten from here. Big wings is what Fuel and FUddle gives the customers.

Fries: Regular fries are cool. Nothing special. It was this place that I first had sweet potato fries. They are thin cut fries and are solid. Again, nothing special.

Workers: College students. Never had a problem with anybody.

Atmosphere: Nice spot after hours. Feeds the entire University of Pittsburgh Campus. Dark and dim during the night and you can catch a live performance every once in a while.

This place will always have my respect because I associate my college experience with their wings. Much respect Fuel and Fuddle.

Solid spot."}
{"text":"Wow. Really really disappointing. Got the Moby dick (fish sandwich). I would have been happier if it were bland.  Instead it was just plain awful. The batter was overlooked and the steaming pile of fish within was just awful. How to describe awful? Foul taste. Just that. Amped by the fact that the slaw on top tasted terrible and the water was retained in the fish after it was cooked so it quickly turned into a sloppy mess at the first bite. The fries were fine so there's that and the beer was good but that is the only positive. Not gonna complain but never getting food again. Ugh."}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent!  Wings great and burgers was spot on..love the sweet potato fries...and $2 Yuenglings can't beat that, Sunday special."}
{"text":"Meh.  This place really doesn't have anything great going for it.  The food is OK, but with Uncle Sams, Mad Mex, and other great spots only a stones throw away, I don't really see the appeal of this place.  Apparently the local beers and waffle fries are good, but I had to go for the Yingling."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Fuel and Fuddle based purely on the fact that it was open late and we were starving after our movie.  The thought that first struck me when I arrived was that the floor was covered in trash; dirty napkins, straws, french fries, and who knows what else.  

We were seated at a small table and the backs of the booth seats were cinder blocks--not comfortable at all.  Then we were handed sticky menus, which prompted the use of hand sanitizer after handling.  When I asked the waitress for recommendations she basically said everything on the menu was great (definitely hard to believe).  

As for the food, my husband ordered a margheritta pizza, which came out burnt to a crisp on one side but otherwise was fairly good.  I ordered the nachos, which were covered in burnt cheese, huge chunks of unripe tomatoes, a few black olives and half a carton of sour cream.  Both entrees looked very unappealing; I ate about four nachos before pushing the plate aside.  

Out of the entire disastrous evening, the service gets the prize for very worst.  After the food arrived we never saw our waitress again and waited twenty minutes for our check.  My husband finally had to get up to look for her and found her texting in the back.  We ended up not leaving a tip, a definite first for us.  

If your looking for a late night bite to eat, do yourself a favor and go across the street to Primanti Brothers."}
{"text":"A BOAT-load of beer! A hundred-some choices from light to dark and everything in between. Can't go wrong for beer. 

Depending on the time of day, a long wait may be awaiting you, although we had a table at first try this last time, at lunch-time on a Saturday. 

Food: ...alright, nothing to get too excited about. I remember it being better in the past. The choices are many but my wife could not find their famous 'going-cold-turkey' sandwich and they weren't willing to make this now-off-the-menu item either. 

We may go back, or not but our excitement is a little gone."}
{"text":"Too crowded.  The only thing I remember is the sweet potato fries.  Delicious.  But not worth the trip."}
{"text":"Stopped in around 1am for some pizza after a night out with the girls. It's not the best but their late night menu hit the spot. Back in college they used to have half priced nights. I got pizza and was able to substitute chicken. The staff was friendly and we got our food pretty fast."}
{"text":"A classic Oakland restaurant with a great atmosphere for a night out or a quiet dinner earlier. The beer selection is very thorough with a large selection of IPAs.

Recently I tried the alligator stew here and while it is good the place that fuel and fuddle really excels is their sandwiches.

A must for any students in the Oakland area with their late night special."}
{"text":"Great happy hour special (4pm-6pm and unadvertised, I believe) and the appetizers were all really tasty.  While the menu looks like typical bar food, our quesadillas were flavorful and packed with pork. During a mid-August afternoon, it wasn't too crowded till closer to 6, but that might change during the semesters. I'll still stop back and check it out though."}
{"text":"This place wasn't as good as we were expecting.  My pizza (Classic Maggie) was good, but nothing outstanding.  My husband's burger was completely charred and basically inedible.  We didn't bother sending it back as our waitress was nowhere to be found.

It's your typical bar food with a decent beer selection...nothing more, nothing less."}
{"text":"Fuel & Fuddle is the Lucy to my Charlie Brown.

I want to like the place.  I really do!  The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly.  The staff is nice (although the owners clearly subscribe to the \"hire only the prettiest girls\" theory of staffing, which is a little annoying).  And everything on the menu sounds delicious.

There!  That's why I don't like the place.  Everything sounds delicious.  SOUNDS.  Yet when the food arrives, it inevitably disappoints.  It's just not as good as it should be.

Part of the problem is the bread they use for the sandwiches, which tastes institutional and consistently underwhelms.  Several times I've had sandwiches there that would have been awesome, except they were on that lackluster, tasteless bread.

Positive things:  the beer selection is good.  The appetizers are passable.  I have no comment on the half-price food thing because half-price for mediocre food is still overpaying.

In summary, I want Fuel & Fuddle to be awesome.  But it simply isn't."}
{"text":"F&F is not a restaurant; it's a way of life.

I went to college in Pittsburgh, and there is NOTHING like F&F's half price Late Night experience. F&F is not the only place that does the half price Late Night thing, but it may as well be, for me.

After 11 pm every night, most of the menu is half price. You do have to get there early (10:30 ish on Fri/Sat/Sun) to put your name on the list, but for students, standing outside and chatting with your friends is part of the experience.

(Edited to add: Don't forget to tip on what your full bill would have been!)

My faves include the sweet potato fries, baked brie (!!!), Smashed Potato pizza, and turkey or buffalo burgers. I've heard they have amazing beers (but I don't drink) and I know they've got some fantastic desserts (my fave was the bread pudding which is gone now, but the brownie and apple turnover dishes are delish too).

They also have a surprisingly good brunch, and for the record, the basement is much less loud than the upstairs.

Every time I go back to Pittsburgh, I make sure F&F is on the agenda. Like I said, it's not just a restaurant."}
{"text":"Fuel & Fuddle is a nice option for lunch or dinner in Oakland.  They have a solid menu that ranges from specialty pizzas to a full out chicken dinner.  Lots of craft beers to choose from as well. 

Many menu items are cooked in a brick oven in the corner of the restaurant - from the pizzas to the crab cakes - so if you like that style this is your spot.  For pizza I think it is great, for items like the crab cakes, meh, not so much.  

Most meals are served with a mix of regular french fries and sweet potato fries.  The prices are a little more than what you'd pay for a typical lunch (plan on about $12-$15 for a meal and a soda) but worth it.

It gets crowded FAST and there is limited seating and a small bar.  Larger groups can sit in the basement which offers larger tables with bench seating.  

Staff here are attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Our first dinner in Pittsburgh -- great burgers, pizza, and salads. Walked off dinner around Pitt. We would definitely come back and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"This is where I had my first sweet potato fries. The brick oven pizzas are great. The service is good. I had a friend drop half a quesadilla on the floor. We asked the waitress for some napkins. After she gave them to us, she came back with half of a quesadilla. They have some interesting beers. I'm not a beer guy, but you might be. I will return to this place."}
{"text":"The place is cozy with a nice atmosphere. Good selection of beers. 

Ordered a basic burger and fries. The fries were room temperature. The waitress did offer to replace them. The burger was juicy with good flavor. 

The waitress did say the pizza was their specialty."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I've never had something I didn't like here. The wait staff is always really nice and quick. They also have a great selection of beer."}
{"text":"This place brings great memories to me :) Its a cute bar/restaurant place,and i guess its mostly filled with CMU kids and maybe Upitt.They have a good list of beers and i am a great fan of their food.
   Wait for it....The world's best fried called the \"Waffle fries\".It's just soo tatsy and out of the world.everything time i think of good food ,i still wonder if there is a place which makes waffle fries.This is the place where i first ate waffle fries and i am going back for that..pssst..i even wanted to make a trip to Pittsburgh just to eat them ;).And the last thing i wanted to do before leaving pittsburgh was...any guesses??
   Yes!!!eat waffle fries :)They are great!!but not healthy apparently.It's a great place to go hangout with a bunch of friends,and relax.Don't miss it !

{"text":"Awesome restaurant and bar to go to with friends! The only reason I give it 4 stars is because parking can be hard to find (only street parking is available) and there isn't a great spot to stand and wait for a table to be ready (we have always had to wait for a table when we go.) The pizzas, pierogis, and buffalo chicken dip are awesome! And the beer menu is always changing and has some really great options on it! Highly suggest."}
{"text":"Good casual place to grab lunch or dinner! I got a burger and fries and it was great! The burger was huge and the fries were a mix of russet and sweet potato. The service was also great and everyone was very nice!"}

{"text":"I tried my first buffalo chicken pizza here 8 years ago when my parents were visiting me at PITT... and I've been hooked ever since. 

Loud and fun college atmosphere. This will always be one of my favorite restaurants to go to in Oakland."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite hangout joints. After 11pm, most of the food is half-off which is great.

I ordered:
'rollafatty' 
giant slices of pepperoni and mild cheddar cheese rolled in our made-from-scratch pizza dough and fired in the brick oven. served with house-made sicilian marinara $7.5

and

'the smashed potato' 
seasoned smashed potatoes, apple smoked bacon, mild cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions drizzled with house-made buttermilk dressing $8
add grilled rosemary chicken breast...add a buck! (Which i did and you should too!)

Now the RollaFatty is good, but the portion was too small to pay for it at full price. But the Smashed Potato was well worth it :)

I'd gladly go again :)"}
{"text":"I am an out of town-er visiting the area, and stopped in here for a bite at lunch.  The food was good, the Chipotle Polka appetizer was very spicy but delicious.  I am not one to continue eating something if my mouth is burning, but those mini pierogies were tasty!  My sandwich was good, the veg head.  It wasn't anything overly special though.  I took a bite of my man's rosemary chicken sandwich and that was very good.  The best part, they give you half sweet potato fries half regular fries... you get the best of both worlds... the sweet potato fries were fried perfectly to a nice crispiness.  Not soggy at all and bursting with sweetness.  We went around 1:30 PM on a Monday and it wasn't to crowded.  The service was decent, the atmosphere was calm, and the prices were suitable for the amount of food you get (I still have 2/3 of my sandwich and half the fries in the fridge now).  Good place!"}
{"text":"i can't remember if i really like the food here, except that I loved getting the mixed basket of idaho potato and sweet potato fries and the politically incorrect \"irish car bomb.\"

more than anything they have a big room downstairs where i could come with 30+ folks and haggle over how to pay the bill, lofl."}
{"text":"Disguised as a wood stove restaurant, Fuel and Fuddle also serves as a beer lover's emporium. As an undergrad student at the University of Pittsburgh I often would head over to Fuel and Fuddle during the late night hours for its unique takes on classic American cuisine. But it wasn't until I took a seat at the small bar in the corner that I realized I was in a place that was so much more than just a good place to eat.

The beer selection is amazing, literally hundreds of brews to choose from including pale ales, porters, IPAs, stouts, you name it and Fuel and Fuddle has it. On the wall behind the bar hangs the names of people who have at least tried 100 different beers. I even saw a plaque celebrating a patron who tried 1000 different beers. Count that. 1000 beers. That's pretty impressive.

Around ten beers are on tap, each one is a different style giving the beer lover a great number of options to choose from. If the draft beers don't fancy your tastes then you'll surely find a beer you love in the selection of over 500 bottled beers in stock.

For its selection of unique beers, Fuel and Fuddle's prices are varied. Draft domestics are as cheap as $2.00, but some of the rare micro-brews and import bottles can be upwards of $10, so if you are drinking on a budget it might be in your interest to check the price with the bartender before you order.

If you are looking for rowdy drunken foolery Fuel and Fuddle is not your place. The bar area is entirely too small for anything than merely drinking. Furthermore, if you are trying to find a place to watch a game Fuel and Fuddle isn't really suited for that either. The TV's are small and positioned at awkward angles coupled with the noise level from the restaurant makes it impossible to hear any of the commentary.

Fuel and Fuddle is best suited as a kick off to a night or a place to get a couple drinks after dinner. For a beer lover, the selection is unmatched anywhere in Oakland and can compete with any place in the city. For it's beer selection I recommend this bar to beer-lovers passing through Oakland."}
{"text":"An impressive beer selection and purely average bar food round out Fuel and Fuddle's offerings.  Most dining options--from burgers to brunch--cap out at mediocre.  But with a hundred beers to choose from, this place still earns three stars.  If you're not up for drinking, however, you can find much better options."}
{"text":"This is definitely a college student geared restaurant. So if you like that kind of environment then yes, this is the place for you.  

I personally wasn't impressed by the waitstaff, atmosphere, or the food for that matter. I had the portobello mushroom sandwich and asked myself what it was.  The sandwich had nothing of substance besides the huge roll of bread it came on. I took off the singular shriveled piece of lettuce that came with the blackened burger and ate my sweet potato fries instead.  
Now, that is something that you should go for! The sweet potato fries are perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. They aren't dripping with oil like other places so I don't feel like a total glutton. 

I remember coming here my freshman year for their half off and ordering their famous mashed potato pizza.  It was a good time, I tried ordering it again when my friend invited me for dinner and couldn't finish the darn thing."}
{"text":"I came here this past Saturday after the Pitt vs. SBU game for a bite to eat. I hadn't actually eaten here in quite some time and I ended up being pleasantly surprised with the food being tasty as I remembered it being. We got there right before the big after game rush so we were able to snag a booth. I didn't catch our server's name but it took us (and I'm not exaggerating) 15 minutes to get our first drinks. They were drafts so it's not like anything needed to be done except pouring them in glasses for us. The draft list was  not what i remember it being. They had maybe 10 to choose from however, they were all from 2 breweries. I'd have liked to see a bit more variety since that is what I always remember them being known for-their beer selection. After we finally got our first drinks we put in an appetizer, the fire baked brie. The brie was baked in their pizza oven wrapped in dough and served with caramel drizzle and apple slices. The taste was very good-oozey,cheesy,gooey-exactly what you'd want it to be. I think they should serve it either with more apple slices or some type of crostini or crackers. For entrees, my boyfriend and I decided to order 2 pizzas and split them amongst the two of us plus his friend that ended up joining us. We ordered the flying buffalo (Fresh Mozzarella with Grilled Rosemary Chicken & Celery Tossed in Our Scratch-Made Buffalo Sauce Finished with Crumbled Bleu Cheese) and the slaughterhouse (Housemade Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Giant Pepperoni Slices,Crumbled Italian Sausage and Apple Smoked Bacon). Each was around $9 and was an 8 cut pie. The flying buffalo was my favorite. The sauce was not overly hot and it blended nicely with the blue cheese. I only sampled one slice of the slaughterhouse and it was basically a loaded meat pizza. It was pretty good however the crust was pretty burned. The friend joining us ordered the chipotle polka (Mini Potato & Cheese Stuffed Pierogies Smothered with Sweet Onions,
Bacon and Smoked Jalapeños in Adobo Sauce. Topped with Sour Cream,Cheddar & Monterey Jack Cheeses) He had a lot to take home but he said they were pretty good. I'm not a pierogie  fan so I can't attest to his review since I did not try them myself. overall Fuel and Fuddle is still a good place to go in Oakland, just be able to tolerate extremely slow service and possibly having to wait for a table if there is an event and you don't arrive before the rush."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, reasonably priced. Was better when they ran their half off specials after 11pm before renovation, though. Their fries, especially the sweet potato ones, are delish! Can't go wrong with their fire pies (pizzas) either. The Big Azz brownie, literally a brick of chocolate with ice cream, is one of the most sinful things I've had. An Oakland Classic, I would recommend everyone try it at least once!"}
{"text":"Cool little place hidden away in Oakland.  Great place for a few drinks and apps.  If your a vegiterian this is a great spot."}
{"text":"Ordered Pirogies today...soooo good. Also ordered a Penn Pilsner...also very good. Excellent service. When I visit my son at Carlow Univ...will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"It's basically a loud, dimly-lit sports bar that serves cheap, greasy 1/2 finger food after 11pm. Nothing really stood out and, again, the food was really greasy. 

Meh. Go if you have midnight munchies and you want cheap food."}
{"text":"This was a classic all throughout undergrad especially freshman and sophomore year. I went here for late night food every week in my earlier years and once a month later on in undergrad. 

I always ordered the skinny dip (buffalo chicken dip) which never disappointed and also got the funnel of love which is a really delicious funnel cake. 

I started regularly ordering the pierogies as well which quickly became a favorite of mine. I think I have such positive opinions of this place because I associate it with such fond memories of undergrad."}
{"text":"Had salad one day for lunch while visiting Pittsburgh. Decent enough and the vegetables were fresh, but waaaayy too much dressing (get it on the side). If it's cold, try the chili."}
{"text":"Overrated, bad spot to eat. Their nachos were horrible and complete waste of 10 bucks"}
{"text":"Very laid back environment and reliable service! We came on a Saturday afternoon for drinks and appetizers, and sat at the bar. The bartender was attentive but not overbearing and got us our drinks pretty fast. Their beer list is laid out by type - very helpful! We got the Rollafatty appetizer - delicious! I'd come back here if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"Traveling on business.  Until tonight I didn't have a reason to return to Pittsburgh.  BYO burger was great, when I asked for my fries crispy the waitress told me I would get both regular fries and sweet potato fries (my wife loves them, me not so much) I hesitate and just go with it.  The huge plate of food came and I tried the regular fry first as always to confirm crispy, good, then a sweet potato fry, AWESOME.  I have never had a sweet potato fry that was even close to crispy and these were not only crispy but tasted great."}
{"text":"Came here for beer with the co-residents after giving a physics lecture earlier in the day.  

Food (7.5/10) = Got the meatball pizza.  Definitely enjoyed the thin crust pizza.  But getting to business, I came here to chill with friends and for beer.  Fuel and Fuddle has a great beer selection.  What surprised me, was that they carried Abita, which is something I haven't seen since leaving Louisiana two years ago.  Great beer, indeed.  Happy hour is from 16:00-18:00. 

Ambiance (7.5/10) = Didn't really pay attention to the place actually.  Was just enjoying the beer and hanging with the co-res.  

Service (8.5/10) = Our waitress was great and attentive.  Checked on our table frequently to see if we needed anything, but not at the high frequency of being annoying.  

Overall opinion = will come back to this place for sure for the next 4 years to decompress with their great beer selection.  I only wish that they extend their happy hours to 19:00."}
{"text":"We were in Oakland today around lunch time. I checked the places I had bookmarked for the area. Fuel and Fuddle was across the street from where we were shopping. We walked in and loved the decor and set up of the place. 
Our server was very nice. She answered our questions and quickly got our drinks. My husband ordered the Moby Dick sandwich and I ordered the Chicken Pesto pizza. 
The Moby Dick is a fish sandwich. The piece of fish is 3 times the size of the bun. It's fried in a great southern style coating. It's not the type of batter you find on Pittsburgh fish sandwiches-thick and greasy. There is also coleslaw on the sandwich. It tastes good and gives a great crunch. The best part (besides the coating) is the tarter sauce. We are pretty sure it is house made. It's the best tarter sauce I've ever had. It was thick and creamy and had great flavor. The sandwich is served with a mix of regular fries and sweet potato fries. 
My pizza was the size of a dinner plate. It has a thin crust and is baked in a brick oven. It had a base of olive oil, followed by a layer of pesto. Then it was topped with a creamy cheese, pieces of grilled chicken and tomatoes. One bite and I was hooked. I liked the thin crust and the crispy edges. 
We enjoyed our dining experience from start to finish. We we go back soon and take our friends."}
{"text":"Hit this place while in town for the Memorial Day weekend.  Dropped in for lunch on a rainy Sunday, while visiting the Pitt campus.

The burgers stood out on the menu, even though there looked like plenty of interesting entree's, but many of them seemed more like dinner...

Ordered the Hangover burger.  I'm always a sucker for a bacon and egg burger.  Burger was fantastic, cooked a bit more than the med-rare, but close enough.

The side was a half and half mix of sweet potato and regular fries, the sweet potato fries looked like they had been sitting for too long, a bit shriveled and fairly chewy.  The other fries were great.  

I didn't order any beer or cocktails, but looked like a great selection of beer.

Dropped a star because of the fries.  Overall a good experience, would give them another chance."}
{"text":"If you're a beer lover, then you will LOVE this place. Not only is their beer selective expansive, it is also top notch. Just about every time I visit I order something new to try with the help of their knowledgeable bartenders. 

It's dark and gives off a bit of a moody feel, but that is awesome when it is crazy hot outside and you're trying to escape the sun's death rays. So far the food has been sort of hit-or-miss for me. The first time I visited, even though I was definitely having a good time, I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and took about two bites. It was terrible. Even the waitress admitted that it definitely was not one she liked, and she was nice enough to take it off the bill for me, though I did not ask. 

Their meatloaf is killer, and I highly recommend ordering it with a side of sweet potato fries. In fact, if you aren't very hungry you should order a half-and-half mix of their regular and sweet potato fries. The fries are soooo good here. I wonder how many times I can put fries into this one paragraph ...

I have also had a few of their pizzas and only had one bad experience: their margherita pizza. I'm pretty sure it was just the cook that particular visit, but it was just awful. Not just flavor-wise, though it was more of a cheese pizza than a margherita. I picked up a slice and all of my toppings fell through the back. No joke. The bottom of the entire pizza was so soggy, it couldn't hold together. Which also makes for an unpleasant experience in your mouth, in case you were unaware.

All in all, I would recommend a visit to Fuel & Fuddle if you are in the area. Be careful in regards to parking - finding a space on the street is usually impossible and a quarter will only get you 7 & 1/2 minutes in the meter."}
{"text":"Nachos = heap of chips with mild cheddar, canned black olives and a few slices of jalapeño that had been microwaved into a rubbery, tasteless mess. Black bean and quinoa burger = bland, cold, gray patty of mush served on a stale roll. Avoid."}
{"text":"This is one of the few locations in Oakland that, at the very least appears, to be able to pass a sanitation inspection in my native county. The cleanliness along with upbeat college environment makes it a spot that I enjoy going to eat at as opposed to ordering takeout.

Fuel & Fuddle also has a wide selection of beers and has some pretty sweet late night deals (I think half off). The menu is also quite extensive featuring a mix of finger and utensil food. The quality of the items does seems to be consistent as I've been satisfied with all the entrees that I've tried so far with my favorite being the fish sandwich."}
{"text":"Would give this place negative stars if possible. Horrible service. Drink we're so bad we sent them back. Buffalo chicken dip was disgusting - how can you mess that up? Burger came out cold. Awful service, even worse food. Never again."}
{"text":"If your looking for a collage town hang out look no more. It's small and the tables cramp you together so it has a intimate vibe. It has a large selection of beers and liquor. Definitely guaranteed to satisfy the picky ones. The food is awesome there's so many good choices it's hard to go wrong. I am personally a huge fan of there sweet potato fries I don't know what's different from there's to others but it's so hard to stop eating them. Today I decided to try the flying buffalo pizza. I am so happy I did because it was so delicious it all paired together so well. The dough was thin crust but had such a full flavor. The chicken was packed perfectly with flavor notes of the rosemary. The scratch made buffalo sauce was beautiful not to spicy or overwhelming flavor. It all blended together so well I was so pleased. I had to get some to go being I couldn't finish it all because the portions are large. I will definitely be returning here in the near future."}
{"text":"2 words: Late Night! I've always been for their late night special which is half off the menu. Fuel is your quintessential cheap late night food that gets the job done (burgers, wings, fries). 

This time I ordered the chicken quesadilla with smashed potatoes and sweet potato fries. I was pretty disappointed by the chicken quesadilla. It was bland and had very little chicken and filling. The sweet potato fries, although not the best I've had, and the smashed potatoes were satisfying! All sides were $3

Great for large groups. Very casual, college environment (in the heart of Pitt's campus)"}
{"text":"Flavor explosion! I love the food here, there is nothing on the menu that isn't completely delicious! Food of this quality is really the exception rather than the rule in an area so close to a big school as I've learned.

But the service has always been slow when I've visited and the place is always loud, even when you're in for lunch and the place is almost deserted--though if you're in it to really enjoy the food, that's when you want to go."}
{"text":"We were in the Burgh for a mini vacation, ok there on business to see King Diamond! However, we were scared that the place would be a ghost town,past 11:00.
We were happily wrong. We stumbled into this place, after a tedious drive, and chowed down on some great grub. 

No qualms with the food, the party of 6 was happy! That is a rare occurrence!

Oh I had a $6.00 dinner, since I got a side salad, a side of veg, and a side of fries. All were satisfactory, and yummy."}
{"text":"A great gastro pub in the University area. Although it was very loud inside and the service wasnt anything to write home about, its a great place to grab a burger or a beer (which they have plenty of-- phenomenal craft beer and draft list!). If you're coming here, be sure to make room for the regular fries AND sweet potato fries that come with your meal-- yum. I got the Rosemary's Breast sandwich and it was pretty unique-- very filling as well."}
{"text":"Neat, bar-ish atmosphere but with a local feel. Great beer selection, I was very impressed. The food was very good as well. Thanks for not steering me wrong fellow yelpers! I probably would have passed over this place were it not for the great ratings! I'd come back!"}
{"text":"If you're in Oakland with friends who are divided on drinking vs. eating, Fuel and Fuddle is a good compromise: big beer selection to satisfy the drinkers, and plenty of food options to keep the eaters happy.

The portions here are really generous.  While not listed directly on the menu, you can request a side of just sweet potato fries (instead of the mix of regular and sweet potato fries), and the plate you get is huge.  The pizzas here are pretty good, with thin crusts that are nicely chewy.  The dessert portions here are the largest I've ever seen--the brownie is about three or four times larger than the typical bar brownie and the nutter butter pie is the tallest peanut butter pie I've seen.  I like how Fuel and Fuddle tried to put its own twist on the apple turnover with the apple \"burnover\" by using pizza dough instead of puff pastry.  The dough itself, however, could have been more sweet--even with warm apple filling inside, the chocolate sauce drizzled on top, and the vanilla ice cream, I felt the dessert lacked something.

As other reviewers have said, this isn't a place to go to if you want to have conversations.  In a party of six, I had to stick to talking to the people right next to me, and even then I felt like I was nearly shouting.  The food and drinks here aren't bad at all, but not quite enough to convince me to frequent this place if I'm not already in Oakland."}
{"text":"I don't know if the waitress was having a bad day, but it turned into a uncomfortable experience.

Normally I like to order a byo burger, with ground beef and all the free toppings. But when I told the waitress this usual order, she repeated my order with a slow incredulous blink and unnecessary tone, \"All the toppings?\" \"Yes, all of them. I like them.\" And she continues to repeat this two more times, and me having to confirm this. I haven't had a problem with this order before, and it doesn't list that there is a limit to the number of toppings. I couldn't understand the difficulty in why she had to repeat this more than twice and I had to reconfirm this more than twice. Is she judging me? I didn't understand. 

Still confused as to why I have to repeat myself four times, I go on to say that I have ordered this byo burger before several times, and there weren't any issues with the previous orders -- the waitstaff took my order without a problem and the burger came out fine (really good) in the past. Then she says as if I WAS A LIAR and said, \"Ok but I don't know if it'll all fit.\" 

Burger came, burnt sweet potato fries. I really don't trust this meal.

Thanks, I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Excellent sweet potato fries and really nice beer selection. However the food and service lacks consistency. The first time i dined here I ordered a type of pulled pork sandwich. Alas it arrived blackened beyond recognition and my friends complained about the way it smelled. And don't get me wrong i love a good bonfire and the scent of charcoal just as much as any girl, but not so much when it's on my plate. After that experience I've mostly stuck to ordered sweet potato fries and the pizzas. During another instance my friend and i waited an hour for our food. upon finally flagging down the waitress she revealed our order had been burnt and the chefs forgot to recook it. (I knew I smelled something burning!!) we only had to wait about 15 minutes for them to redo our order....but when they brought it to us it was the completely wrong dish. The waitress was very apologetic and handle the situation very well. And we didnt pay for our food. Apart from that the experience has either been hit or miss. Some days the pizza is spot on. Others days the crust is a charbroiled and shriveled husk. I must say I do love half off the menu after 11pm."}
{"text":"Food was meh...service was decent. Torn between a 2-3...opted for two since I couldnt even finish my meal.

If youre int he area and looking for a late night bite...try mad mex's instead."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good! I've been here a couple of times and ordered different things. The menu is vast so really all and any kind of American food can be found! The pulled pork sandwich was scrumptious and the wings were well done! I also found Angry Orchard Hop'n Mad Apple cider here, and it's the greatest drink in the world! Best cider I've had in the States! Good on ya for having his delicious bottle around, Fuel and Fuddle!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, outstanding menu, good service. It's easy to see why it's so popular. A really fun place. I ordered a meatloaf sandwich, my friend ordered a Caesar salad, both were wonderful. An ever hanging draft list on a blackboard will have you coming back. Small and loud is part of the charm. Fun, fun, fun!"}
{"text":"Such a fun, unique place! The food is definitely filled with deliciousness. Some are good for you choices, some truly indulgent American classics but with a funky with a twist.  My favorite meal is the flying buffalo pizza and sweet potato fires. Their homemade ranch dressing is truly the bet ranch I've ever had. Its thin and salty.  
Fuel and Fuddle is located on Pitt's campus so make sure you check the basketball schedule before planning a visit."}
{"text":"Good food and relatively inexpensive. Good beer selection and good service.  I had the pulled pork bbq sandwich. Very good!"}
{"text":"One of the nicest Burgers in the Oakland area. At least among those I have tried. They also have a wide veriety of beers that you can try."}
{"text":"I've never gone to F&F for late-night, which is when the line can stretch out the door. However, the lunch menu is reasonably priced and the pizzas are amazing - some of my favorite anywhere.

Also, F&F has a wide selection of beer, and even has a beer bible where you can fill out the beers you've tried."}
{"text":"Everything is great here food wise. Their pizza is excellent, and their nachos are great too! The service isn't the best, and if the hostess has friends at the door she might seat them before you."}
{"text":"I've gone here for lunch two times, and each time, I've gotten a sandwich and fries (mixed russet and sweet potatoes). Both times, I was happy with what I ordered. It's all quality stuff, but speaking as a \"poor grad student,\" the value for your money isn't as good as it would be at some of the other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I think I've only gone once during non-half-off hours in my four years in Pittsburgh because my general opinion of Fuel & Fuddle is meh.  It's meh as in nothing to wow me, but not at all a bad-meh as I have gone pretty frequently during half-off hours.  Located right off of Pitt campus, you really can't beat a decent $5 meal.  For half-off on most nights, do expect to wait 15 minutes for a table and 30 minutes for your plate.

The food is okay.  It's basically average all-American food, although some dishes just aren't well made.  I remember I once ordered a salad dish with guacamole...couldn't finish it because I couldn't ask for water refill fast enough to wash down the over-abundance of flavor...  Then there was a chicken wrap that featured really charred chicken pieces that didn't taste too great and was WAAY too salty.  BUT I know that the potato fries are pretty good and some of their weird pizzas are pretty tasty...  Also, most plates have a good amount of food.  Yay American sizing =)

Overall, I recommend it especially if you're in college.  It has a college atmosphere and helps you stay on a budget.  And really, the food is SOLID to GOOD."}
{"text":"It was alright, but at least the sweet potato fries were good.

Fuel and Fuddle is your typical casual, late-night dining spot that prides itself on their pizza, burgers, and other bar food. The Havana Burger and quesadilla were good, but not great. I might come back for their cheaper late night menu (11PM - 1AM everyday) but the food was definitely not worth the regular price for me. 

The highlight of my experience was the sweet potato fries that came with my burger."}
{"text":"Came here a few times and it's always more fun in the night. I came here for lunch with colleagues one time and it was decently crowded. We were able to get a table without any hassles which was great. Everyone in my group enjoyed Their food and the we ice was good too. I ordered a salad and it was food as well. Portions are quite large, so be prepared for that. It's decently priced.

One of my favorite items is their dessert pie which is like a giant cookie filled chocolate which was absolutely delicious. It's quite heavy though, so I'd recommend sharing that."}
{"text":"I loved this place: amazing pizzas, great drinks, good atmosphere. Until I experienced an incident involving a mouse. We had paid our bill and were just waiting to leave when a mouse suddenly scurried across the window sill above our booth and across to where my friends were sitting. We all flew up and out of the booth in reaction to this. Our waitress came over to ask what happened and we told her. Her reaction was slow. She casually walked back to get the manager. All he did was say he was sorry. No refund or anything was offered and I felt like I was being interrogated to find out where the mouse was. This was the worst experience ever at what used to be one of my favorite places to go and I will never return."}
{"text":"I have had food here about 3 times now. Once at the restaurant and twice I have ordered from Grubhub. I've had the wings, Cajun steak and shrimp dinner, meatloaf, and beer mussels. All of them were so delicious and my Grubhub delivery was fast and fresh! It came from Oakland to Lawrenceville in about 45 minutes. My chef friend introduced me to this spot and it's always great."}
{"text":"Fuel & Fuddle strikes me as one of those establishments that stirs sentimental feelings from patrons who were regular visitors during their college days in Pittsburgh. 

Either that or it's the funky, brick-walled, logo-laden atmosphere. 

I'm all about the food, ya peanuts, and aside from a rather accomplished pizza, I came away unimpressed. 

Kay, myself, and I friend who lives in the vicinity were to catch a concert ('Again?' I hear you groan...) at the Petersen Events Center and of course needed that pre-show bite to carry us through the proceedings. After having remembered that a fellow Yelper or two has mentioned that F&F is a favorite dining spot of theirs, I thought we might be in for some good grubbin'. 

As I wrote earlier, I did savor our crudely named C'mon Iwana Leya Hawaiian Pizza. Succulent, lightly brackish grilled ham played off the juicy, caramelized pineapple like accomplished twin guitarists, the stage being a thin crust that was akin to a dusty, toasted pita with its union of chew, crispness, and char. Fresh, silken mozzarella blanketed the affair while a house-made bourbon-infused BBQ sauce brought richly sweet, intoxicating undertones. Dark Paradise would have been a more fitting title for this gripping story of a pizza/appetizer. 

I came very close to ordering the Alligator Stew, but its description conjured images of me not finishing what read like a Shepherd's Pie that might have been stingy with the armored lizard in question. Translation: I thought it might be too filling and lacking in gator.  Nah, I wanted something a little lighter. 

So whaddya know? I went with a Havana Burger. 

And I began to wish I'd been more adventurous. 

I like Cuban sandwiches, and I am obsessed with burgers, so it stood to reason that I should have been pleased with this handheld hybrid.  Instead, aside from the above average regular and sweet potato fries (a helping of each is apparently included with each burger), the overall entree left me chilly, especially when one considers F&F's chuck, sirloin, and brisket blend. Yet that 1/2 pound patty, ordered medium-rare, was cooked medium, creating dryness where there should not have been. Crud, Eat 'N Park's Superburger is juicer than this was. Also unforgivably arid were the ham and pulled pork. Provolone and dill pickle chips had marginal involvement as did whole grain mustard and roasted garlic mayo, which were plopped in the center of the burger itself without being spread about. While not a deplorable burger, it wasn't worth the boat ride from Miami, know what I mean?

Dessert was a toss-up between the Sweet Potato Cheesecake, Nutter Butter Pie, and The Big Ass Brownie. F&F doesn't make the cheesecake in-house, so that was quickly dismissed even if it's probably very good (I'll go to Enrico Biscotti Co, if I want to try it). The Nutter Butter Pie was promising, but once more trepidation caused me to order the brownie. My readers will know that hot fudge brownie sundaes are arguably my preferred dessert over them all, but this one was not nearly as \"gooey\" as F&F states on the menu. Old \"Big-Ass\" was more like a large cube of warm chocolate cake topped with walnuts, chocolate syrup, caramel, and vanilla ice cream with some raspberry (?) puree acting as a clever, artistic garnish (see my photo). Moderately tasty it was even if the cake (this was no brownie) wasn't as moist as I would have liked. Still, I craved something fudgy, something dense, something dripping with molten ooze. It wasn't to be. 

Nonetheless, the service was fine, and environs were welcoming enough. Perhaps my ordering instincts shorted out when I came here. Restaurants with many fetching options sometimes do that to me."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant in the area!
The servers are always pleasant and quick. The food always comes hot. The beer comes cold. 
Their menu is entertaining and there's something for everyone.
My favorite is the Grilled Psychedelic sandwich. It's a portobello mushroom sandwich and is always very good. Their wings are great too! And they also have the option of getting sweet potato fries with your food!
The atmosphere is spectacular - always fun and lively - and after 11:00 P.M. the food is half price! 
I really do love this place."}
{"text":"When visiting Pittsburgh for the first time, some locals directed us to try this place and we're glad they did...having now lived here for a little over a year it remains one of our favorite hangouts in the city and given its Oakland location makes an excellent walkable destination for college folks looking for something a step up from Hemingway's and the like (without a step up in price).

When you step in, there's always a fun message on the chalkboard usually making fun of something to do with chain restaurants or horrible NASCAR style beers...neither of which have any connection to the fare or beverage selections here.  There's a dizzying selection of bottled brews on the menu, but attention draft fans the larger chalkboard inside the place is what you want to be looking at.  There are always a dozen or more interesting worthwhile selections up there and if you're stuck for suggestions, there's an employee favorite listed at the bottom.

The food is delicious and portions are ample, most of the time if we don't split an entree we end up with leftovers (never a bad thing!).  I don't think we've ever tried a dessert but we've had most of the salads and sandwiches and several of the entrees and never a disappointment among them (also, there are a bunch of unique pizza options though we've never really been into pub pizza, preferring the big floppy NYC stuff).

Favorites include the buffalo burger, turkey burger, meatloaf sandwich, and the salad with the candied walnuts and avocados...thought you probably can't go wrong with anything they serve.

Finally, in Oakland tradition, late at night most of the food (see menu for details) becomes half-off for those on restrictive budgets (or those who would just prefer to preserve more dollars for the aforementioned draft selections).

If you're in the Pitt/CMU area and looking for something with more variety and better sit-down atmosphere than Primanti's or the \"O\" definitely surf over to their web site and see if the menu catches your fancy!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly my favorite place in the entire United States. It's unfortunate it has to be in Pittsburgh, PA...but that's part of what makes it awesome in it's own way. I am giving this place the honor of my very first Yelp review even though I have not lived in Pittsburgh for more than a year.

This place has amazing American pub food. The nachos are piled high with an indeterminable amount of good toppings. The buffalo wings (and other kinds of wings) are large, properly covered in sauce, and perfectly spicy. But the best food here are the pizzas. The Flying Buffalo, the Garden of Eden, et. al. No matter what mood you are in, there's an awesome personal pizza to be had.

As if the food wasn't enough, they have probably the best (not the largest - the best) beer selection in Pittsburgh. House brews and Great Lakes (from Cleveland), Guinness, Yeungling, all on tap. More than 50 others in bottles. At decent prices too!

Almost all food is half-off after 11PM every night - which is key.

On Saturdays, the \"house blues man\" Don Sjzeck, plays his awesome mix of Johnny Cash, Greatful Dead, blues, and rock covers as well as his fun sing-along original stuff. It made every Saturday night awesome for me.

Hangover Breakfast on Sunday mornings is great for its stated purpose. Unlimited coffee, bloody marys, etc.

Do what you need to do and go there one night. It's worth it and its an awesome Pittsburgh experience."}
{"text":"The plan: Get there by 10:45 to beat the half off food crowd that gets there at 11PM. Order some beers and wait for a table. They usually have specials going on. Sit down by 11 and order some food at half off. Except diner waffle fries they are NOT half off. 

I think these people own Joe Mama's two doors down. 

Vegtarian: Portablello burger with sweet potato fries and ying yang rolls! yum!"}
{"text":"So sad that their late night menu is now $6 instead of $5. However, their chipotle polka pierogies are still worth it. The pierogies are filled with potato and cheese and then cooked in a spicy chipotle sauce. The caramelized onions, sour cream, cheddar, and bacon elevate these from just normal pierogies to a cheesy delightful explosion in your mouth."}
{"text":"This was the first time I'd ever set foot in Fuel & Fuddle, being of the 'older' generation, who tends to steer clear of college haunts...but I'd had their food before, compliments of Wheel Deliver, in the non-20-something safety of my home. 

The food that I'd had had frankly been somewhat impressive, even for delivery, which I'm discovering in da burgh, tends to lean toward the 'let's skimp a bit' side. It was last summer, so I can't remember everything we'd ordered, but I do recall a pasta dish with seafood that was actually a healthy portion, as well as very creamy and tasty, with some nice plump shrimp.

So this past weekend, with an old high school friend in from out of town, after already having eaten a big lunch, then sitting through a movie, we were peckish at the dinner hour. We initially wanted to try the Conflict Kitchen, but they were closed on a Sunday for the dinner hour, so we drove a few blocks over and started to hunt, and I thought 'Hey, let's give Fuel & Fuddle a physical try!'.

We were met at the door by an absolutely delightful young gal named 'Morgan', who was not only greeting us at the door, but she was actually there to OPEN the door for us. She took us to a table, gave us our menus, and returned in mere moments to take our drink order - Coke products - thank GOODNESS - our lunch choice, a Mexican restaurant, only had Pepsi (or Pessi, as they put it) products, and by dinner I was seriously Jonesing for a DC. Morgan assured me that she'd keep the glass full and she did.

Since we weren't up for a full meal, the decision was made by my friend, after minimal suggestion, that dinner needed to be WINGS and CHOCOLATE. So we split an order of Garlic Parmesan wings, and then split a Big Assed Brownie. 

The wings were very good, plump and juicy and flavorful, served with Ranch Dressing, and the ten of them sated our small appetites just fine. 

However, Morgan was a trooper, and the kitchen was extremely accommodating when I asked a special favor. When we'd ordered for delivery, I had been dying of curiosity about their Alligator Stew. I'd had my Gator Bites when living in Florida, but had never had gator meat in a stew. Every time we ordered, they ended up being out of the stew, so I'd never gotten to try it. Now, we were in no position to devour a full meal, but I still wanted to try it. So I asked if they might be willing to part with just a sample for future reference, IF they had any. Morgan checked, and the kitchen obliged with a small bowl of the mashed potatoes covered with a small sampling of the gator stew. It also has chicken and sausage in it, but they were easily recognized. The gator was tender and flavorful as well. Morgan said she'd never try it. I may have convinced her to step out of the black and gold box and take one bite...to expand her horizons. The stew really is very good. And come on...like everything else that people think is too weird to try...tastes like chicken. Well, ok, not really. It tastes more like pork with the texture of soft ground beef.

Next up came the dessert. Cindy ate the one of the brownies and a few bites of the ice cream, and took the second brownie home, and I just picked at the ice cream. It was perfectly fine for what it was. A big assed brownie with ice cream, walnuts and chocolate sauce. 

The crowd WAS very young, and had it been packed with this age group, I probably would have opted to move on, but being that it was summer and a Sunday, it was not packed, and therefor tolerable.

Morgan thanked us profusely for being so nice, to the point that I can only imagine what she might go through with her 'regular' crowd. And that would be the crowd I'd try to avoid.

But for an off-season evening, it was a very pleasant experience. The food was good, the atmosphere pleasant, the service perfect, and the price was decent.

And they definitely have a few variations on the menu that I'd like to go back and try when I'm up for an actual dinner.

There was no Fuddle, but plenty of Fuel.

Good job, and thank you Morgan."}
{"text":"Most of my visits to Fuel and Fuddle were for their late night menu, which in my recollection begins at 11pm. There's always a line out the door before then so be ready to wait. I loved their big wood-fired oven. The pizzas are really tasty (smoking hen, the naked truth, and the smashed potato pizzas are must try's!). Try their big ass brownie sundae, but be sure to share it with a friend because you won't be able to finish it alone."}
{"text":"Well said Jessica W. 

I also want to put a special note in about the waffle fries, more specifically, the awesome sauce that comes with them that is completely addicting. I have had generally good experiences with fuel and fuddle, however, my dessert spoon tasted of green onions the last time I was there. Strange combo with peanut butter pie. But definitely good bar food."}
{"text":"Excellent! I ordered through grubhub and the food arrived hot and quick. The pierogies are so good! You can never go wrong with cheese and bacon. My burger could have been seasoned a bit more but other than that it was pretty good too. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"They deserve 25 stars. I stumbled into the place on my lunch break and it is beautiful. I had no idea the food was sooooo brilliant and good. I had the cheese burger and fries. I literally wanted to sleep on the floor after i ate. yummmy!!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to go for my 21st birthday. This was not my first choice after looking at bars on yelp. But after going here, I wouldn't have wanted to go anywhere else. We didn't want to go to a dive bar, it needed to be open past 12 and we needed to be able to order food. This place checked off all of our boxes. The place was cool, small, had high ceilings, decorations on the walls, and felt warm- aesthetically. Our waitress was really good. She served me my first legal drink. The prices were really good. We were there at a time that the late night menu was available, so food was cheaper. As a college student, who does not attend Pitt, it was still really cool to be there and be around younger people. I got a blackened chicken wrap and it was so so good.  I didn't even get a picture of it, because after my first bite, I wanted to eat the whole thing. I also got fries with it and they said that they could give me sweet potato and regular fries, which changed the whole experience for me. I thought that was really cool, because I love both fries. We got chicken wings too, they were really good. Everyone I was with was happy too. They offered bottles and tap and they had so many whiskey and bourbon choices which was really cool. The menu was cool because it explained the differences between whiskey and bourbon which was cool to read. Would return - happily."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery a few months ago. Their sandwich and fries were good but the pizza was COMPLETELY BURNT TO THE PINT WHERE IT WAS INEDIBLE."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of good things about fuel and fuddle so I was pretty excited to dine here, but I was a little let down.  We were crammed at a tiny table between two other tables where we were stuck listening to the surrounding conversations.  The service and food were decent, nothing special...except for the fire baked Brie, that was awesome!  Maybe our experience was just \"okay\" because we were here for dinner when it was packed, we didn't drink, and we made bad entree choices?  I might try this place for lunch or late night some time and see if my feelings change."}
{"text":"Just came back from lunch with a friend. She ordered the special Big Ass Fish Sandwich, which was indeed huge. I got the Veggie & Hummus Phat Wrap--also a lot of food. Overall, very serviceable, my skirt wasn't blown-up but it's a good place to get good food that's not expensive. I will say when I asked for the other half of my wrap to be boxed up the waitress came back with a box for me to do so, which in general I'm not a fan of.  But here, where the space is a bit tight it's kind of awkward to have to box your own food."}
{"text":"Fuel and Fuddle has my favorite wings of all time. I love the hottest ones! I eat lots of spicy food, and these are the only that are both tasty and spicy. Great beer selection. I love the alligator stew and waffle fries, especially. 

Only problems with F&F is how crowded it gets, how loud it gets, and that it's in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I used to come here five years ago when I was in college and I had a lot of great memories. The food was never extraordinary but they had a few good dishes. However, I went back recently and was extremely disappointed. I had been looking forward to their jerk chicken wings and they are now using a new sauce that doesn't have nearly as good of definition or flavor. They brought all of our food out at once (appetizers, soup, salads, main dishes) and some of it was cold. This happened because our waitress was sweeping the floor for ten minutes when our food was up. Generally the only items we had that were good was the house salad and the sweet potato fries. The chicken chili had potential but it was barely warm. To boot the restaurant was not very clean when we were there. The bathroom smelled, both toilets were clogged, and there was no toilet paper. All in all, I had high expectations and was disappointed."}
{"text":"Service was good. Attentive and polite staff. However, the food was low quality, very salty, and uninspired."}
{"text":"Absolutely AWESOME place to go for late night. Bar is great, and the menu for late night is fantastic. They literally have everything that you can imagine...I always get the psychedelic wrap with the portabella mushrooms. Wish that the fries were half off at late night too. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because the wait is impossibly long at night...wish they were better with moving people along."}
{"text":"As a Pitt alum, Fuel and Fuddle is by far my favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh.

1. Fuel's late-night (11pm-1am) $5 menu is unbeatable. After a long night studying or at the end of a fun weekend, Fuel is the best place to go with friends.

2. Everyone finds something addicting to order at Fuel (many people more than 1). The burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, appetizers, and - surprisingly - SALADS are all addicting in different ways, and the main struggle ordering is deciding between all of your favorite dishes. I always end up ordering the Skinny Dip (buffalo chicken dip), but I also love the Smashed Potato Pizza, Hog Heaven, Veg Head, nachos, and Chipotle Polka. All of the sandwiches are served with a mix of russet fries and sweet potato fries, and lots of people pay the extra $2 to get all sweet potato fries because they're amazing. To be honest, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!

3. If you want to try 100+ beers/whiskeys, go to Fuel. They have \"Beer Bibles\" to keep track of which ones you've tried, and you make it on the wall when you get to a certain number. 

The atmosphere at Fuel is dark and sometimes loud, and the servers are quick and no-nonsense. Try it out to see for yourself!"}
{"text":"This will always be my favorite go-to late- night college student food spot! It has a fun, underground vibe, and with half price meals after 11 pm it's perfect for a college student.

The best dishes are:
- Smashed Potato pizza: It is so good! By far the best thing on the menu. Actually me and my boyfriend like this so much that we've even tried to recreate it! 
- Skinny dip: Replace the chips for the delicious sweet potato fries! They go really well with this spicy buffalo chicken dip
- Turkey wrap: For the days you're not feeling adventurous or want to pretend to be healthy - it's still pretty good though!

The wings are good too but I wouldn't try to explore this menu too much after that (the rest of it isn't that great). A lot of the dishes here are pretty hit or miss.

A few cons: After 11 pm this place gets ridiculously crowded. If you have more than 4 people in your group you'll be waiting for at least 45 minutes even if you show up 15 minutes before half price time to put your name in for a table. But I suppose time is the price you pay to get your food half price. Also I am not a big fan of the bar - I ordered a drink here once and the bartender took what was nearly double the price of the drink and didn't give me any change assuming it was a tip! I tried to get her attention a few times to no avail.

Although I would not come here full price (after paying half-price for so long), this was a great place to hang out with college friends and eat some cool eclectic food!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! I had the mashed potato pizza, which was one of the most guilty cheesy treats I've ever had. And I tried a little of my sister's nachos - awesome :) All the food is simply amazing!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure. One of the best beer selections in town. Relativity simple bar food menu, but the food is excellent. Very friendly service (particularly for Oakland ). Can't go wrong here, great place"}
{"text":"Fuel and fuddle is great. I've been there three times, and had different experiences. The first time when I went with a small group, I love it the burger was delicious and their sweet potato fries is everything! I love it. The second times I went with a group of six and they seat us down in the basement. For some reasons, maybe the server forgot about us but we waited forever for the food and for our water to be refilled. I didn't have a good experience. However, the third times I went with a group of 12 and we were again seated in the basement but food came out quick and everything was tasty. The only reason I didn't give them a four stars is that one experience and also I like BRGR or burgatory better. The food was great, but it wasn't Outstanding. I would go back if I'm around the area and someone wants to go, but it's not somewhere I want to go specifically!"}
{"text":"I had the steak burger ($9) and it was quite good. They actually made it medium rare (I've had trouble getting anything rarer than medium in Pittsburgh when I order medium rare). It comes on a long soft, roll- it's definitely different, but palatable nonetheless. The burger had a nice char on the outside and was still juicy on the inside. It came with a mix of regular fries and sweet potato and those were a nice touch. I had a brown ale of sorts ($4.50) and it was not too malty and not too heavy. Service was quick and the staff was helpful."}
{"text":"What do I love about Fuel & Fuddle? I love the kinda massive selection of beer.
I love the appetizers: Skinny Dip (a nice take on Buffalo chicken dip) fire baked Brie and the nachos.
What do I like about Fuel & Fuddle? Sierra grilled chicken and campfire steak and potatoes.
Lots on the menu to choose from so definitely need to get back and try more."}
{"text":"Excellent management and hard-working staff. A relaxed and casual vibe with delicious and creative foods and unique drinks and beers. We love the new quinoa burgers! Try the sweet potato fries too. A go-to, never-disappointing spot!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place! This restaurant has a great old American feel. The menu has many choices including: sandwiches, burgers, entrees, pizzas, salads and desserts! They also have a large beer selection. 

The first time I came here, I got the meatloaf sandwich. It was pretty good! Not super memorable but tasty. The second time I came I got a margarita pizza with chicken on it. It had a great crispy crust but the cheese was super mushy. Overall it tasted pretty good! 

Next time I wanna try the skinny dip (buffalo chicken dip) and one of the cool desserts!"}
{"text":"I will always remember this restaurant fondly because it started my love affair of sweet potato fries.  They would mix the sweet and regular fries together and let me tell you, the regular fries were sorely neglected every time!  

Funny thing is, this place is such a college-y hang out, but it's actually a really great place to grab food in Oakland.  Plus, the over 21 crowd can enjoy the great beer selections they have on tap here.  I LOVE places with a wide selections of beers on tap!  For some reason beer just tastes so.much.better out of a tap!

All the wood grilled selections are fantastic! For apps....3 words: Fire Baked Brie.  3 more words: TO DIE FOR!  I've also always been a fan of the individual pizza's and the Sierra Grilled Chicken Salad for the lighter side (of me!).  The sammie's are also very good.  I'm always into a good Portobello option, and the sandwich is fantastic with light balsamic drizzled on top.  

Annnnnnnd bargain time for poor hungry college students and people who still act like poor hungry college students (maybe me).  It's half price food after 11 PM.  I may not have went to school in Oakland, but we would stuff ourselves (literally sometimes 7 people) into one tiny car to have some late night bites.  Seriously, there's a lot I do for food and being squished inside a car for a 10 minute drive is totally worth it here!"}
{"text":"Their mashed potato pizza is delicious and they have a grrrreat draft list! it is also great to visit Fuel after 11 to get discounted menu items. As far as Oakland goes, you can't get an atmosphere quite like Fuel's anywhere else."}
{"text":"I love this place!! It's such a college scene, so be aware of that. If you go there after 11 at night, almost everything is half off! 

They have great food and a wide variety of drinks and a fun atmosphere. It is really really loud inside, there is no sound absorption in the place. It can be extremely crowded, and there are many times when you have an hour plus wait to get seated. - Also, don't forget - this is Oakland. Have fun trying to park!!!! :)"}
{"text":"There will always be a soft spot in my heart for Fuel & Fuddle, and I think it's safe to say all other Pitt grads feel the same way. Good food, good people and darn good selection of beer.

Everyone will tell you that their sweet potato fries are a must. They are awesome - so don't miss out. Most people will say you have to try Fuel's wings or Rosemary's Breasts, which are fine, but honestly, I'd have to recommend the Classic Veg Head and the Smashed Potato. They put the Veg Head sandwich in the brick oven just long enough so the provolone cheese melts over the hummus and veggies - it is phenomenal. And who would have thought smashed potato on a pizza would work, but believe me, it does. Plus, there's bacon and ranch dressing to help solidify just how good it is.

Fuel is not a big place, so be prepared to wait for a table - but it's completely worth it."}
{"text":"Second time here..food way too salty. Rosemary chicken and Bada Bing both were so salty we had to ask for water to get it down. 
Too bad..
Great bear selection though but won't be back for food."}
{"text":"I love fuel. It's a shame that I live off campus or else I'd definitely be here more often for late-night (after 11 PM). I don't usually get drinks here but their smashed potato pizza and sweet potato fries are to die for. I always only come here for their pizza, wings, and fries. Rollafattys weren't horrible but I don't think they're worth it. And the Caesar salad was just a Caesar salad. Pizzas 10/10, wings 10/10, sweet potato fries 10/10. I only come here for late night so this review is based off of that. I LOVE FUEL. Also shout out to Zoë the hostess, she da bomb."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Oakland. As a student, you cannot beat their late-night deals. The $6 menu after 11pm includes pizza, wings, sandwiches, etc. Their sweet potato fries are the best I have ever had, but what I love most about these fries is they offer a combo of sweet potato fries and regular fries which truly is the best of both worlds. Even without the late-night deal, Fuel is still affordable and delicious. I'd recommend the Smashed Potato Pizza, the Hog Heaven (pulled pork sandwich), the Carolina Gold wings, and the Steak and Potatoes salad."}
{"text":"This place has a good selection of American food and beer.  If you're up for waiting for a while then I would suggest the half off after 11pm deal, but I do go here for full priced food.  My favorite is the 'Goin Cold Turkey' which is actually a very simple meal of a huge slab of turkey, red onions, chunks of tomatoes and garlic mayo on a big soft bread roll.  Its served with their famous mix of sweet and regular potato fries.  I haven't been dissapointed by their pizza or their salads either.  The fire baked brie is also a tasty little morsel that I would suggest for sharing.  It can get very noisy in here, and if you sit in the basement you can feel a little excluded.  Nothing fancy here, but I would suggest it for a Lunch or Dinner with friends or family."}
{"text":"Best place in Oakland to go. Was staying downtown but still made the trip over to eat and drink there."}
{"text":"Fuel & Fuddle is a bar & restaurant in Oakland - the heart of Pitt campus, but you'll find a lot of Carnegie Mellon students there, as well as students from other colleges. It's half off after 11 pm, so good luck finding a table. 

I recommend their pizza - I get the flying buffalo often. I also recommend their nachos - plenty to share. Not anything to write home about, but still well made. Everything here is good.

They have a fairly big beer menu and drink menu."}
{"text":"Apparently they have waffle fries again... they took it off temporarily so they could increase its price on the menu...

I guess I have to give them a star back. (did you know Mad Mex has waffle fries too now?)

The standards are pretty much their pizzas (smashed potato, buffalo chicken, etc.), waffle fries, and sweet potato fries after 11 PM when almost everything is half priced.  The wait is LONG as it gets ridiculously crowded as the masses of CMU and Pitt kids head down (if you miss the 11 PM rush, get ready to wait close to an hour).  Since waffle fries are pretty much the only reason to go to Fuel and Fuddle and there's no late night discount on them, I'd recommend going BEFORE 11 PM and just grab a drink with your fries and then head out to enjoy the rest of your night.  Their house beer is excellent and I believe they have a rotating tap.

If it happens to be Thursday, Friday or Saturday night and you're still hungry, you can head down to Sphinx Cafe where a guy grills up hot dogs (2 for $3), burgers (2 for $5), and pulled beef from 10:30 PM until 3:30 AM right outside."}
{"text":"My memory of this place is wildly different from the food I had experienced the last night I was here. I ordered a Margarita pizza, but what it really was was a cheese pizza with a few tiny pieces of basil scattered on top. Paper thin, flat crust. For a wood fire pizza, I was expecting something a bit more flavorful. 
Second, I ordered the Walnut Avocado salad. The avocado had been previously frozen so it was flavorless and mushy.  Aesthetically, when the food was set down, I did not want to eat to it. Nothing looked good, and nothing really tasted good either. 
What saved this place was their price of beer and the server. Both were remarkably good."}
{"text":"I went late at night with a bunch of friends and they struggled to have us seated until one of my friends suggested outside seating. We were split into two tables (with different servers) so my table was served first and the other wasn't served till I was halfway done with my order.

I ordered a smashed potato pizza from the half price food menu (but they were all over a dollar from being half priced....) and it was pretty good despite the burnt edges on the pizza and bacon."}
{"text":"1/2 off food after 11. random/eclectic \"bar\"ish food, but all pretty good. my favorite is the \"smashed potato\" \"live fire pie\". it is SOOOO good. what good be bad about bacon, cheddar, mashed potatoes and ranch dressing? sounds a little bit strange, but what's not to like? =D

also great sweet potato fries, and bourbon bbq wings. their sandwiches are also good, but usually i stuck with the smashed potato."}
{"text":"Fuel & Fuddle has been my number one destination for late night food since I moved here 4 years ago. A no frills college bar and diner, Fuel & Fuddle is often the best, if not one of the only, choices for late night food in the area. They have late night pricing for many of their menu items that is very economical. My personal favorites are the Rollafatties and Fire-baked Brie, I usually order those two and a beer and it makes for a delicious, unhealthy fourth meal.

5/5 for their beer selection, plenty to choose from
4/5 for their atmosphere. It can be chilly sometimes and the seats are uncomfortable, with often cramped walkways
4/5 for the food. Top notch for what it is: college bar food"}
{"text":"Fuel & Fuddle is one of the major reasons I come back to Pittsburgh. Forget homecomings, reunions, or weddings, the one undeniable reason to visit is Fuel & Fuddle for, of course, late night half-price.

As a poor college student, the Fuel & Fuddle 11pm half-price was a saving grace from the mundane university dining options. Not everything on the menu was half price, but most of the good stuff was. The menu is fairly unique, but also familiar and executed very well. There's something here for everyone, including vegans, vegetarians, girls who just don't eat that much, bros who eat a ton, and beer snobs. 

My fraternity brothers and I would come here every Sunday at 10:30pm to put our names in for groups of 10, 20, even reaching 30 on one crazy night. Good food, good conversation, some of the best memories I had in college. The waitresses are always very friendly, and are usually very attentive.

I've tried just about everything on the menu, but here are some of my favorites : 
Goin' Cold Turkey -  HUGE slab of turkey, with a HUGE portion of fries (russet or sweet potato). I usually ask for the garlic mayo on the side to dip both my sandwich and my fries in. Unbeatable.

Smashed Potato Pizza - One of the more unique pizzas they had here. A layer of mashed potatoes with ranch, lettuce and bacon. Pretty amazing.

Flying Buffalo Pizza - Buffalo wings on a pizza. Enough said. I usually asked for bleu cheese sauce instead of the crumbles they put on for a creamier texture. 

Swamp Rub Wings - A bit on the salty side, but a pretty unique peppery rub. The wings in general here are all delicious, and are all jumbo sized.

Only thing here I would avoid are the wraps. My friends and I ordered them on several occasions and they didn't even come close to comparing to the other sandwiches on the menu.

Overall, my many fond memories at F&F might make me biased, but this is one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh, if not the entire country. Count on F&F for great All-American bar food and great times to be had by all."}
{"text":"I've had a variety of their salads, thai chicken skewers, loaded fries, and brownie. Oh their brownie so good!! I use to love coming here, not the parking around the area is a pain in the neck. Food is good. Prices fair. Seating can be cramped. They do have seating down stairs. NEVER come there on evening of Friday! It's a mad house!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Whether you're looking for lunch, dinner or a place to grab drinks, this is a great place to come to. Their beer selection is pretty good and their food is pretty good as well. 

This place is pretty busy regardless of the time of day you come so seating can be hit or miss here. Usually though, I've been able to get a seat fairly quickly everytime I've gone. All the food here is pretty good tasting so you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Arrived at about 7pm and the place was PACKED. We were told that the wait was about 10 minutes... 10 minutes that were probably well-spent because we found Carmen Sandiego as she walked in the door! (So maybe it wasn't her, but my bf does mention that the resemblance was uncanny. Long brown hair, red trenchcoat, etc.. yeah.) But that's another story.

After the wait, we were lead downstairs, which we found to be quite empty. (Granted, there were about 4 or 5 tables there, but only about 3 people left the place.. from upstairs. So maybe they were just waiting for a waitress for the downstairs area.) Food and drinks were pretty decent for the price. The oven-baked brie (with honey and apple slices) tasted pretty good. I would advise against the nachos - it was mostly pre-packaged chips... That was pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"I really can't justify going here any other time but late night, but late night alone is worth 4 stars. Food is always good, not spectacular but really good. Can't really complain!"}
{"text":"Fabulous rotating draft beer selection and the servers have generally been very helpful in making sure I pick something I will like. 

Pizzas there are my go-to, but everything I've had from their menu has been great. I'd argue they have one of the best veggie burgers in the area. Love the regular/sweet potato fries combination that comes with it. 

The only reason I am giving four stars instead of five is because this place is just not an option when dining with my son. They make clear on a sign by the front door that they do not accommodate children."}
{"text":"I went during the lunch rush, but it was waaaayyyyyyyy too loud for me.  I had a guacamole themed salad, but instead of actual guacamole it had this weird thin spicy guacamole style dressing, which made me sad."}
