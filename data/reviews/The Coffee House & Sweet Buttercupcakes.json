{"text":"A quaint little cafe sandwich shop across from the El Dorado n Rainbow casinos. Love discover in jems like this ever since movin here to Vegas. And the Henderson area has so much to offer, love the old town vibe of this area. The Coffee House is a great example of neighbourhood hospitality. Friendly services n personal detail attention to meet each customer's needs. Outstanding in every ways: food, service, drinks, etc."}
{"text":"Cutest little coffee shop with very friendly staff. DIRTY CHAI LATTE was awesome! Will definitely be back if I am ever on this side of town again!"}
{"text":"Needed a quick caffeine fix and I was very satisfied. Their cappuccino was really good! I also tried their cookies and it was a nice treat. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I loved how they made their flavored syrup there! Raspberry, mint, cream orange and I can't remember the last one. The mint was super good !"}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop in all of Henderson. They really know how to make my favorite coffee drink and all of my friends come here or I bring them with me. So if you want the best cupcakes and coffee, this should be on the top of your list and if it isn't you gotta go here."}
{"text":"The coffee house in old Downtown has a calm vibe and I had a good experience while visiting. The parking is a little inconvenient due to the location on Water street, (on the street or behind the building. I was welcomed promptly and service was very warm and welcoming. After placing my order I had a great selection of seats from tables, window bar, or even some comfy arm chairs. I ordered and consumed an Iced Caramel latte that was pleasant. Only improvement I would like to see was in the area of cleanliness. It was quite apparent through out the store that no one had swept by mid afternoon. As we all know pastries crumble and have to be cleaned up after. (Visit being 3PM and was not busy). Minus one star for cleanliness but overall enjoyed the atmosphere and service. I would visit again."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. It took several visits to actually find them open, and it seems their hours and menu have changed a lot over time. 8AM is a little late to open a coffee shop if you're hoping to grab neighborhood business, and I would think closing on a Sunday would cost them business from people exploring the cute downtown area.  They focus mostly on beverages, with some limited grab and go food items and pastries. Menu had wraps listed as \"coming soon\", but I saw no mention of the breakfast quiches and sandwiches mentioned in other reviews.   The coffee I got was decent- they have a few unexpected flavors for your latte, like mint, which is seasonal elsewhere. I don't know if they were out of nonfat milk when I went, or if they don't stock it, but they do have soy and almond available?   If you go in the late afternoon, they discount their pastries: cupcakes were BOGO when I went. The pina-colada flavor stuck to the wrapper and didn't wow, but the classic red velvet was well done and disappeared quickly.   Service was friendly. Space is large for groups, quiet for studying, and has a lending library available on site, which I thought was a great touch. Though it's on Water Street, it's not a particularly high-traffic area so it seems this spot is still fighting to stay open and find it's niche in the community."}
{"text":"Totally new experience now happening at this location! French bread and pastries flown in fresh from France. Coffee house extraordinaire so worth the drive."}
{"text":"I love coming to old Henderson!! It's a cute little town where they have different shops on the streets.   Driving around to look for a coffee place, we found this spot! I like the surrounding, it has that college vibe inside. Ordered the caramel latte, and chocolate chip that's baked from scratch! The chocolate chip is a must try, it's so soft and super chocolatey! Latte wasn't bad, but I've had better.  Tip: don't forget to check in on Facebook....they give you 10 percent off your order!"}
{"text":"It's a fantastic mom and pop coffee shop. They have food items listed on the menu I posted. They also have a few pastries like cookies, muffins, and scones. They have a fantastic mint latte. The mint syrup is made in-house. Anyway, good for meetings and studying and just spending quality time with anyone or yourself. There is background music that isn't too loud. They have a books available for anyone to read. They have board games also available for anyone to play. I really want this coffee shop to get more business so please don't be afraid to give it a try."}
{"text":"Cute place, i got the smores cupcake and an ice chai tea, not too bad. The icing on the cupcake was delicious though."}
{"text":"Love that they have almond milk here! Great coffee, friendly staff, and low prices. If they opened earlier than 8am I would stop every morning before work."}
{"text":"Cute, local coffee shot with good Americanos, blueberry muffins, and cupcakes.   Low stars because it was not what I was expecting. The menu linked is NOT current. I was looking for more food (prepping for a big athletic event tomorrow) and there wasn't even a breakfast sandwich to be had. I had a bagel and that was just ok.   Don't skip coming here if you want a tasty cupcake, but go somewhere else if you want a real breakfast."}
{"text":"I love this little coffee shop. It's quaint and quiet. I love to sit here reading a book. So nice to not be in a Starbucks and actually not feel like you're in Vegas for a minute while drinking coffee!"}
{"text":"First time here and I must say they have delicious coffee and also the dirty chai is probably the best I've had in vegas thanks ladies!"}
{"text":"Randomly took a trip to far Henderson with my boyfriend to see his mom at work  (we live near summerlin) and while he and his mom went to wells Fargo, I decided to stop in here. Really quaint and the barista was very friendly in helping me with my order (a vanilla iced coffee with almond milk). Side note: it's great that they have two milk alternatives. I'm not a fan of soy milk. There's random big, comfy chairs to sit on and even a record player with records to choose from (not sure if decoration or useable!) The iced coffee is delicious. Not too sweet, nor bitter. Didn't try the cupcakes as I'm on a low carb diet (no bread for me haha) but they looked good! Good choice stopping in here and getting my quick pick me up :)"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good coffee.  However, after trying one of each kind of cupcakes in their bakery case, I can honestly say that they are not good at all.  The bottom part of every cupcake tastes the same regardless of the flavor (chocolate, vanilla and even red velvet tasted exactly the same) the frosting was also very flavorless.  Also, there is a very strong taste of baking soda and margarine in the cupcake base which isn't good if Sweet Butter is in the name of your restaurant.  Real butter should be used instead of margarine shortening.  The Cupcakery cupcakes are so much better!  Don't think I'm combing back for anything other than a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Under new management......again. But it's still the same old cozy coffee house! My meeting place of choice when I'm working. I love that old time coffee house feeling this place has, and it never loses that no matter who's the owner. If you want a good place to relax either alone or with friends and enjoy a non-commercial cup of Joe, I highly recommend you head to Water Street and check this gem out."}
{"text":"I want to love The Coffee Shop. I really do. I am a fan of independently owned coffee shops, and with this being on Water Street in old Henderson, it's close to home.   My biggest issue with The Coffee Shop would have to be the operating hours. Opening on weekdays at 8 am means there is no chance of me stopping in here for a cup of caffeinated goodness before work. Closing weekdays at 2 pm means there is no opportunity to swing by after work either. And with The Coffee Shop being closed on Sundays, that means Saturdays are the only days I can get coffee here.  Allison S. and I stopped in on a Saturday hoping to get a little breakfast and some caffeine before starting a day of shopping. The food menu was limited to sandwiches, salads and some crepes, so we inquired about other breakfast offerings. The man working, who I believe is the owner, suggested a souffle which sounded excellent so we each decided to get that as well as a drink.  Food is made to order at The Coffee House, which we were warned about when we ordered, so there was a short wait for our breakfast. There was a musician playing the guitar and singing both covers and original songs for us to enjoy as we waited. Our drinks came out rather quickly, mine was one of the daily specials and it was excellent.  I wish I could say that the food was as good as the drinks. I don't eat a lot of souffles, but I am pretty sure that they are not supposed to be quite as runny as the ones we were served were.   I'd love to return to The Coffee Shop for more caffeinated drinks, but unfortunately due to the hours it may be a while before I get a chance to do so."}
{"text":"This coffee isn't great and the atmosphere was bland. I don't plan on returning here."}
{"text":"Adorable little place off of Water Street in old Henderson. I came in on a Saturday morning, the service was friendly and quick. My husband and I both ordered ice coffees, he had a bagel and I tried 2 of their mini cupcakes. The red velvet and the lemon with strawberry frosting were delicious and freshly baked. For everything it was under 11 dollars, surprising inexpensive. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Good vibe, not crowded on a Saturday. Free wifi and affordable good coffee. To top it off, they were nice enough to send us off with free cupcakes. Nice touch and nice people. Would recommend, especially for a mellow place to read, study, or use the computer."}
{"text":"We had he tuna sandwiche, turkey and provolone and a grilled cheese (just ask and they make kid friendly sandwiches) and an Americano. The tuna was the BEST! We enjoyed the atmosphere and the lovely staff! Would've had cupcakes but heading to the farmers market for shaved ice :)"}
{"text":"This place has been many coffee shops in the past several years. I'm hoping this one sticks around. I'm happy this place at least has normal business hours. I've been in a couple times now that they are under new ownership. I dig their coffee. Not the best, but definitely not the worst. The prices are not  to steep. But I have to say this.... If your business's name has cupcakes in it then your cupcakes better rock. I've tried their mini cupcakes twice and have regretted it both times. The frosting is horrible and the cake is dry, dry, dry with no flavor whatsoever. Put it this way I could do better.  Coffee House and Sweet Buttercupcakes definitely should step up their cupcake game or just drop the cupcakes off the name of the business completely and stick with coffee. Fingers crossed this place sticks around. Goodness knows old Henderson needs a decent coffee option other then Starbucks!"}
{"text":"I visit several coffee houses and cafes in the area with free WiFi. I'm a student and am in constant pursuit of a good vibe for studying. This place nailed it! Nice music, very comfortable, nice location, free wi-fi, and friendly staff. I will be coming back frequently and highly recommend it to students and readers."}
{"text":"A quant coffee joint with dimmed lights and pandora music ambiance. You'll find a short and flavorful menu dedicated to the simplistic needs of its patrons. Don't let it fool you though, the drinks are made right and perfect. You can't go wrong here. A more intimate setting than your average coffee house. Variety of seating is available depending on your comfort need."}
