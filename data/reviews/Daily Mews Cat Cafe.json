{"text":"Highest priority to see a cat place while visiting. I didn't have much for reviews to go on but this exceeded my expectations. As a cat person I was delighted to find them. 

You walk in and there's a gift shop and coffee stuff and snacks you can get too. It's there you'll pay admission into the cat area/play room. Everybody here is so friendly and wonderful. It's a great concept to have where you can come in for an hour or more and play with the cats. You'll have to sign a waiver before entry that you can't sue them or anything if a cat scratches you. But if you're like me it's part of the charm of owning a cat, or they own you.

Before leaving I browsed the gift shop area and have something to take back with me. Very clean, organized. Nothing like the dungeon some shelters can appear to be. When I'm in the area I'll be back."}
{"text":"We wanted to surprise our 11yr old Goddaughter with a visit to Daily Mews.  Having never been to a cat bar (for lack of a better term - they do sell bottled beer during your visit, but I wouldn't technically call it a bar), we weren't sure what to expect.  We were blown away by the set up, the amenities, and the staff.... not to mention the sweet cats!  The place was semi-crowded; surprising for a Tuesday at 430P!  The staff took the time to explain the protocol and described each cat and their personality in depth, then we were free to play and pet.  And all the cats are available for adoption, which is an awesome way to put these little guys and gals into loving forever homes.  What a great concept!  We'll definitely be back."}

{"text":"This is a cozy, beautifully decorated place where you can spend time with adorable, playful cats.  It's an awesome way to find your next pet if you're looking to adopt, or just to get some quality cat time if you're not.  Love the wine selection. Also has great gifts for cat lovers."}
