{"text":"After being bitter and insulted over being hit up for a cover charge on one Saturday evening I am adjusting my review. This is our local bar and I have had many great times as the service is always good and the food even better. I took my frustration out in a business that didn't deserve it. Great food and people . Not a fan of the new Saturday night Dj/cover but to each their own there is a place for everyone. My apologies for my anonymous poor review this is a way better place then I gave them credit for. Perhaps a breathalyzer on my yelp account would be helpful"}
{"text":"I wrote a really bad review several years ago, so when my friends wanted to go hear Tres Amigos play on taco tuesday I was very hesitant but I'm happy to say it was a much better experience.   Good music, good friends, and good chips and salsa started the evening out well, and continued with awesome $2 tacos.  My friends who didn't get the tacos were really happy with their meal too. The service still may be a little slow but the servers are friendly and the atmosphere of the bar listening to awesome music and catching the latest game on tv made it a great evening.  I've been back on several occasions, I'm glad I gave it another try!"}
{"text":"The shrimp enchiladas were good but the service is marginal at best.   They have a great attitude and are friendly but not very attentive.   Waiting to pay for 15 minutes. And they still have not come by.  Good thing is we had the patio to ourselves.   I would give it another try if we are in the area just to see if it was a fluke."}
{"text":"Great mariscos and reasonably priced. Awesome drink specials. Has a clean and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Starting with the stale chips and ending with a disgustingly dirty bathroom with no soap and no paper towels.  I can't imagine what the kitchen looked like.   Beer was good."}
{"text":"Excellent all around. Fajitas. Great. Dessert fried ice cream..awesome.  We are from out of town and found this great place from reviews on here.  Atompshere great waitresses great."}
{"text":"We go here quite often - love the tacos.  The service has been a little off a few times, but they try.  It's a lively place with a good happy hour crowd - can get real busy and pretty noisy.  A cold Pacifico in an iced mug with salted rim and 2 shrimp tacos -heaven!!"}
{"text":"Service was bad. Food was bland. Ordered the fried fish. Was supposed to be a red snapper. Looked like a Tilapia to me. And it was soooooo over fried. I love fried whole fish and this was the worst i have ever had anywhere..."}
{"text":"So now on top of being unprofessional now their liars. The manger did admit to it and the owner saw it on camera. He also admitted to it. 

   It's unfortunate that the service there can't be as good as the food. I can see by the other reviews that this is on going issue with them. This is probably why they are not five star."}
{"text":"The food and service here at baha joes was most awesome,  the beautiful and super fast waitress Faby only made my dinning experience that much more  memorable!!!!."}
{"text":"Walked into the place with my wife and baby. Stood at front desk waiting for a waiter or host for close to 10 minutes, many waitresses saw my wife and I and not a single one said a word to us as we waited there. I even waived my hand at a waitress to come over and help us out and she ignored us. 
In the end we waited and no one came to help us, so we left. It's a joke of service. I will never return and highly recommend no one go there as service was so incredibly poor."}
{"text":"If you want an authentic Mexican atmosphere, this is the place.  They have a trio playing popular and traditional songs at your request (weekends/weeknights).  The seafood selection is just right.  I've had the shrimp enchiladas and the shrimp in mushroom sauce with the \"toritos\" as an appetizer.  They are jalapeno peppers stuffed with cream cheese and wrapped up in bacon, drenched in soy sauce.  Heart attack city but so worth it.   The only downfall for me is that there are way too many tables for the space and the noise level is at times a little overwhelming but after a few Micheladas (beer with clamato) the noise becomes happy whispers."}
{"text":"For you bar flies out there, this is going to be your best bet around this area. Branded as a Mexican &  Seafood Cantina, they provide a vast range of options in both arenas. However, the real draw is the sports bar atmosphere. Perpetual happy hour specials during all Saturday NCAA football and NFL Sunday Ticket. The bartenders are friendly, particularly a guy by the name of Mike. He always makes sure you don't need to wait for a refill and that the customers are taken care of.  If you're in the area and looking for some good times while watching the games, definitely check this spot out."}
{"text":"Great sports bar and restaurant! The food was great and the service even better!! Ask for \"Iris\" when you go, she's the best waitress.. love her!"}
{"text":"This place was rocking, fast service at the bar, great drinks at happy hour, & staff and customers were very friendly. Stiff drinks & great food service. Great to see a tight run ship with grace & fun,!!"}
{"text":"Love Baja Joe's!! I wish I knew about this place long before friends introduced us to it. I hadn't had Mexican food this good since I lived in Tucson. 

About the food: Apart from my mom's house, this is the only place I can go for a good caldo! Other restaurants only offer a generic version of \"tortilla soup\". No other place compares in quality and variety. I also love the camarones culichi. The ingredients are whole and fresh. It tastes like home!

About the staff: They are always warm, welcoming and accommodating - and they remember me and my family each time we visit. I've dined here with my family of 3, brought parents and extended family, and even hosted 50-60 people for my husband's birthday - it's always an enjoyable experience!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so the service isn't always the fastest, but its friendly and the food is great! Fish and pork tacos and shrimp stuffed peppers. Yum!! They just expanded and the new bar side is super nice. Love it!"}
{"text":"Best around.  Salsa great!  Beans and rice, the basis of Mexican food was perfect.  My combination plate was savory, spicy and kept me wanting more.  After years of eating at the other local Mexican restaurants, this is the one the competition should worry about!"}
{"text":"Baka Joe's is a tremendous value!  The food is delicious and pricing for most items are very good.  Service is consistently good.  I recommend it very highly.  We eat there at least twice a month."}
{"text":"Baja Joe's is a great Mexican joint in North Mesa.  It's our go-to for breakfast burritos and amazing dinners. It's authentic, and the clientele reflects that - it's where people in the area who know good Mexican go. The service is always fast and friendly, and the food consistently good. It can get busy for dinner on the weekends, so we often go during the week."}
{"text":"Favorite place to go! I've been going there for years and will continue to. Their carna asada is always cooked perfectly. Best shrimp ceviche I've ever had. And everything on the menu is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I've had shrimp all over. Joe's Crab Shack, Red Lobster, and Bubba Gump's in Las Vegas, Fisherman's Wharf in San Diego and Kona Hawaii.  Baja Joe's is the best shrimp anywhere. It is caught fresh in Mexico and delivered fresh. The chili relleno's are a favorite too. Best Mexican food in Az. The owner/ head chef/manager , (don't  know which or all the same guy) wears the white Head Chef jacket and walks the restaurant and talks to the customers has some good stories if you can get him to set at your table and tell them. Be sure and order the table side guacamole.  Glad it's 2 minutes away."}
{"text":"My favorite place to have a beer and eat some great food. Love the fish tacos. Staff is friendly and fun."}
{"text":"Best fried shrimp taco I've ever had in my life. I have been there half a dozen times already... and every time I get back to the Phoenix area, I make a special trip there and bring new people. I've taken four different people there in the past month or so, and they all had the fried shrimp tacos on flour tortillas, and agreed they were the best tacos of their life.

Taco Tuesday gets you any taco for $2.50, and these are BIG tacos... not street minis. And now for the best part... they put the bottle of chipotle sauce on the table... 'nuff said.  :-)"}
{"text":"Not fancy at all but the food is simple and fresh!! No room for improvement on the food. Service was so so but friendly. Portions are large (we were starved & couldnt finish 2 appys and 1 main for lunch) so don't go to crazy on your order which is hard cuz if u luv seafood u will luv baja joes!"}
{"text":"Once again the servers take others orders first. A person can die of thirst waiting for a beer."}
{"text":"Outstanding local hang out! Food and service were excellent! This was our first visit and we will definitely be back. The fish platter was incredible!"}
{"text":"I always make sure I bring my family here or anyone else that comes to visit. This is close to where I live and the best I've been to in my area. Im a usual...out of all the times I've been here I've only had a rude waitress ONCE...and I've been coming at least once a week for over a year. I take my three kids there each time too. Im a Mexican who likes authentic Mexican food. So this is where I go. Margaritas are good too. Never had seafood but everyone who has had it says its really good."}
{"text":"Great CHIMICHANGAS!! very friendly service and clean Mexican feel restaurant. They make you feel like your in Mexico! The food is delicious !"}
{"text":"This is a very casual inexpensive old-fashioned Mexican food restaurant.  The food is really great and authentic.  Salsas are delicious, and the guacamole prepared tableside is wonderful.  I had cheese enchiladas with onion both red and green. They remind me of the enchiladas that I grew up with here in Arizona.  It was a drive to get here to be with family, and we will willingly do it again simply because it is that good.  Service was great.  The menu is varied and has many seafood dishes.  We will be back that is for sure!"}
{"text":"Grilled fish taco , bad. Pork enchilada, greasy. Frijoles, eh.
Everything tastes the same... Too bad. Quacamole was good"}
{"text":"My family and I LOVE this place. Definitely the best place to go for great and affordable seafood. The only thing I dislike is that the food always seems to take forever to come out and waitresses are super busy all the time but friendly without a doubt. We usually visit on the weekends which is probably why they're always busy but overall a great place for seafood. Id recommend the shrimp chipotle and the desserts, fried ice cream and flan my favorite."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was terrific I believe our waitresses  was named Faby she was so helpful in helping us order she's the best !"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place. The food was excellent! Fresh salsa and great seafood. I would recommend the first tacos for sure. Although everything I have eaten has always been delicious. I am now a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Great patio even if it is in a shopping center.  Service very slow. Chips and salsa were quick to arrive but we were ignored after that for a long time.  Check took a long time too.

Enjoyed the chicken enchiladas.  Will have to try more dishes. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Expanded the bar since my last visit. Not a dive bar but not a snooty bar either. Comfortable and friendly locals"}
{"text":"Good quality Mexican restaurant. Great seafood. We especially like the seafood platter for 2. It is plenty for 3-4 people."}
{"text":"Great food, great Mariscos (Mexican Seafood)  I'm a regular here and every time I come by I am satisfied. Great drinks and great entertainment on weekends as well."}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant but the staff are extremely lazy and cold except for 2 ladies that work there if you plan to go there you'll be waiting for at least 10 mins before they acknowledge your there to be seated when the place is almost empty the food is burnt and over cooked  I will say they have good beans I will not go back because they have lazy cooks that cut corners and they don't seem to care plus the noise is so loud from the bar you can't even have a conversation with your friend or family"}
{"text":"Each time I come back this place has gotten better... From drinks to food to cleanliness... Great live music and the food has always been great... Reasonably priced, and always room for company."}
{"text":"Came baack ofr the two dollar tacos. 
Almost worth it, except
YOUR BAND WAS AWFUL.
DREADFUL TERRBLE!

I ended up getting my food to go. 
Ill be back for the food and service. 

You should sell ear plugs."}
{"text":"Food was great. Large portions for price paid. Chips and salsa were great too. I can't speak for seafood or adult beverages."}
{"text":"La comida exelente pero la mesera nada que ver espero mejore sus modales no creo ser un mal cliente y ami esposa le gusta mucho la comida :("}
{"text":"My first time at Baja Joe's and I loved the food, service is excellent, very nice people working, Iris was my waitress and she did a great job! Totally recommended..."}
{"text":"Ceviche still had shells on it, no ranch served with wings, disgusting celery, not to mention paying $7.00 for a corona, whole place stunk like vomit and beer, bartender had no clue what the specials were. Food lacked flavor to say the least."}
{"text":"I stopped by for the first time on Saturday. I ordered an iced tea. Maybe it's just me but $3.25 for iced tea seemed a bit much. Then I had to flag down another employee for sweetener. I wasn't impressed with the restaurant. I have no desire to return again."}
{"text":"I really do like coming to Baja Joe's. You can't beat the ceviche. It is the best! The only bummer is the extremely loud mariachi music. I think that is what they play themselves off as. Weird to see them drinking beer and playing crazy loud off key music. Hard  to watch and hard to listen.  Definitely can't hear the people you are with.  If you love the food, call ahead to make sure no mariachi band is playing. The food is worth it."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Lots of variety and a full bar.  Service was a bit slow and they added gratuity automatically even though we only had five people in our party.  I usually drive to central Phoenix for Mexican seafood.  It's nice to know I can stay close to home on Mesa now that I've found Baja joes"}
{"text":"Best Mexican we've had in this area, by far!
The shrimp were fantastic.  The salsa and hot chips great.
The service was terrific and the patio is very nice!"}
{"text":"I  used to be a regular, went 2-3 X every month for the last 3 yrs. The food is very good, however the service has deteriorated to the point where the waiting staff , manager and back of the house don't seem to care about customers.
3 recent examples. On Aug 2016 I ordered 6 regular oysters and after 30' they brought special oysters. When i asked them what was this the waitress told me what i ordered and  I couldn't change it. I wasn't in a mood to fight and they were good so i ate them.  Then i went back a month later and sat at the Bar, it was taco Tuesday. I ordered tacos and a cocktail and grabbed hot sauce since waitress was nowhere to be seen. After 10' she came back, saw the bottled sauce and admonished me for not asking her and \"taking it\" from anther empty table.
Finally after bragging about the food i brought 8 people yesterday. We called 1 hr in advance to reserve with Janet. When we showed up at 6:50 they told us 20' , at 7:40 i talked to the mgr about putting 2 tables together that were empty. He didn't even try, so we left and went to Playa Hermosa who moved 2 tables and accommodated us. The food is just as good. Even though its a longer drive i will no go back to Baja Joes until service improves."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their chips are always warm and delicious. The chipotle shrimp is to die for and the Red Snapper Veracruz is the best I've had."}
{"text":"This place turned out to be so much better than I originally thought. My mother took my family out to lunch with a \"groupon\" she scored, and thanks to her I now have a new favorite Mexican food place!

The environment is relaxing and refreshing with a beach-theme and colorful murals along the walls. Service was fast and friendly, and they have great accommodations for families. 

As far as food goes, I couldn't stop eating my carne adobada. Rice had wonderful flavor and texture, beans were tasty, and the homemade tortillas reminded me of the ones I get from Mexico. My family members all tried each others' plates (we like to share) and no one complained about any menu items we ordered. All of the seafood dishes were deliciously fresh. In fact we liked everything so much we got dessert- sopapillas. Those filled us up and just like everything else, didn't disappoint.

Overall I find this restaurant very deserving of my 5-star rating and encourage all of you to try it out! They tend to be a bit spicy on some choices (they even offer a habanero pepper sauce I enjoyed immensely) so ask your server if it's something that might potentially burn your tongue off. Other than that though, go try Baja Joe's for yourself!"}
{"text":"BOMB... Food was on point!!! Perfect for a Saturday afternoon. I pigged out I had a mojarra and oysters especial and I could not complain I am stuffed and loved every piece of it. Both inside and outside are nicely decorated.. I will definitely come back for some more delightful see food.... Service was also on point five stars can't complain try it for yourself"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food. Excellent flour tortillas (could be a meal in of itself). Try to shrimp in garlic. Or the beef fajitas. Prepare to get your hands messy. Outstanding food. Ate here two days in a row. TVs for the sports fans. And extremely clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"Nice authentic foodies. Always nice servers and good service. Breakfast,  lunch or dinner it is a place to satisfy your Mexican food and seafood cravings AND there is a bar there if you aren't through with your evening you can hangout for awhile and make friends or have a great time with old ones."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food and great drink menu. Excellent spot to watch football. I cannot recommend this places enough to people looking for fresh, authentic, Mexican food. It seriously is amazing. My suggestion would be to sit at the bar in the sports/new bar area. The bartenders are very friendly, especially Alex. He makes a mean michelada 'rocky point' style! Great food, huge tvs, and great drink/beer selection. 

Personal recommendations to order: chips and guacamole, all the dif salsas, nachos, and cheese enchilada (red and green are both amazing)

Very pleased to have found baja joes. After moving back to the phx area from Tucson, az, I was starting to fear I wouldn't find an authentic Mexican restaurant. In my opinion, it's the best Mexican restaurant in the valley."}
{"text":"Really good place, I made the mistake of avoiding this restaurant because the previous restaurant in the same location sucked.  My wife and go there 2-3 times a week, if you want Mexican seafood, this is so far the best I have found.  Definitely worth checking out"}
{"text":"Love the food. Love the new bar as well. Free wifi. I had not been here in so long. I did not realized they had expanded. Staff very friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent menu, plenty of choices to please almost anyone. i came here based on Yelp reviews my first night in Mesa (first time ever in AZ!) and while it doesn't look like much, tucked away in a strip mall, there is plenty to be excited about when it comes to the food. Line juice in the bottom of my beer mug gave some great extra flavor to my pitcher of beer and was an awesome extra touch. VERY authentic and a good variety. Service overall was great except for my one complaint below, I highly recommend Baha Joe's.

The one complaint I had is in the length of time it took to get our check. Normally (being an American) I'm not accustomed to asking for it but even when I asked, it took a while to not just get the check, but for them to give us our credit card back. I'm not sure if it's a part of the culture of the restaraunt or not, but this could have been improved."}
{"text":"This place has good food, and good portions. However, I am confused as to how when I call to place a to go order I am told they are to busy to take any to go orders. I know it's a popular place, but turning away business..... oh well."}
{"text":"It's got a lot of Mexican restaurants around Mesa beat!!!!  I usually take home about half a combo meal but this time just couldn't get enough of the flavor in the green chili enchiladas and taco in flower tortilla!  Then the chips and salsa wonderful!  We used a coupon in entertainment book.  The whole idea of coupons is to get you back!  It diffinitly will get us back as service was good and food delicious.  My husband and I kept talking about it the rest of day!  :-). From reviews I think we will stay away during live music.  Oh and loved the wrap around wall murals!"}
{"text":"3 stars food.  3 stars for price.  And 0 stars for service.

We ordered seafood enchiladas, chicken flautas & tacos, and spicy bean dip.  All were good enough.  Nothing extraordinary, but good.  Guacamole was really good, so was their salsa.  Portions from their dinner menu were ok, not gigantic but not small.  

Our orders sat in the back long enough to not be hot and to make my taco all soggy and had to eat it with a fork.  I ordered a side of sour cream and guacamole -- service forgot sour cream.  She asked my husband if he wanted warm tortillas with his meal, he said yes, she never brought any out.  Chips and salsa were brought out  after we ordered.  I thought this was one of those cheap joints where it wasn't included so I ordered chips and bean dip.  And then about 5 minutes before our food came she brought out the salsa and the bean dip.  As another reviewer said about their experience, we also weren't checked up on during our meal at all.  We had to flag her down to get the bill after we stopped eating, which wasn't easy when she refused to look in our direction most of the time.  It was not busy, by the way.  

I'm not counting them out entirely, but this first time was not good and the owner needs to know some of his wait staff are making him look bad."}
{"text":"I had a Groupon for Baja Joes so four of us went for dinner during our Girls Weekend.  The others are right - this place is a little difficult to find - but well worth it.  A small place with bright ocean murals on the wall and an extensive menu of traditional mexican dishes and many seafood dishes.   I had the shrimp veracruz which comes with a mild red sauce.  The shrimp were some of the best I've ever eaten.  The tableside guacamole was also very good but a little expensive at $8.00.  The others raved about their chicken and shrimp fajitas also.  Other than the guacamole, the prices were very reasonable.

I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on great Yelp reviews and was pleasantly surprised. This place has great, authentic Mexican food with a great, fun atmosphere...it's even great for the family on the restaurant side. Reminds me of restaurant/cantinas in Mexican beach towns. The seafood is authentic and fresh-tasting. Will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar at 9:00 pm tonight (Sunday in the summer)  After waiting about 8 minutes, I was finally asked if I wanted anything.  I ordered a beer and asked for a menu...my intention was to order dinner.  I was served the beer (with about 3 inches of foam) and handed a menu.  Then I sat there for 15 minutes while I was totally ignored by the bartenders. I couldn't get them to make eye contact.  Finally, I left the money for the beer under the still half-full glass and walked out.  I only live a little over a mile away and have been there before, but promise I'll never go back."}
{"text":"This Is a family favorite little place of mine...I've had many great dinners here with family...Mexican Food, Margaritas, & Family! What could be better..Oh and they have a private outdoor patio which can spark up some really great convo's!"}
{"text":"Yum!!! Fajitas are awesome so are the fried shrimp tacos. I really love this place, they seat you quickly make a bomb margarita and the food is delicious. We're also big fans of the carne asada and tableside guac."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here on a weekly for taco Tuesday. We have had the best experience with our bartender, Michael. He has always been amazing.  He always recommends drinks, tacos or specials. Michael is great.  This is the best consistent service we have ever gotten anywhere.  We have brought family and friends here to enjoy the experience! ! Thank you Michael and Baja Joe's for the mini escape! !!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place to try and we decided on Baja Joe's.  We were surprised, it was a neat place.  Half bar with a live band and the other half mexican seafood restaurant.  The menu is in Spanish and English with pictures, that is always helpful.  The waitress was really nice and helpful.  We told her it was our first time and she recommended we try the yellow peppers wrapped in bacon, stuffed with shrimp appitizer, AWESOME!  I ordere the mixed fajitas, OK, a bit greasey. My husband order the fish tacos, GOOD.  I don't know what I was thinking, duh, I should've ordered seafood. Next visit I plan on ordering what everyone else ordered, the big clay pot with flames underneath, filled with seafood, looked GOOD! 
Looking forward to my return."}
{"text":"Food was over priced and bland. Dirty tables and overall dismissal experience. Canned refried beans is never promising and it took forever to get our bill."}
{"text":"I ordered the bacon wrapped peppers stuffed with shrimp. They were huge and six of them. I thought there was no way I can eat all six of these along with a beer and some really good chips and salsa. I ate them all and enjoyed every bite. I do wish they had put some cheese in with the shrimp but they were still well done and a deal. The bacon was perfectly cooked and covered the peppers.
The salsa is some of the best I have had and I did not leave one drop in the bowl. The chips were light, crispy and not oily. 
The bartender was an extremely nice young woman who had a great personality and was on top of the service. Why can't all places be like this. I rarely write a review giving this much praise but they deserve it based on my experience. It is a hole in the wall kind of place but it worked."}
{"text":"Awesome food and some of the friendliest servers around.  Try the Red Snapper or Arroz Marinero (my favorite).  The Arroz is a stirring platter of octopus, shrimp, fish, clams and scallops..my favorite dish in the Valley."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband and young child in January 2017. The food wasn't memorable, but what I did remember was the lack of service. I had such high hopes for this place but the bad service isn't worth the cost to eat here. 

Pros:
-Close to my home
-Full bar
-Seated promptly

Cons:
-Took a long time to get our order in
-Waitress barely checked in on us, our drinks, chips and salsa
-Waitress took a really long time to bring us our check
-Waitress did not tell us that we were being charged adult menu prices for our child (She said she didn't know our small 7 year old child was ordering from the child menu, not the adult menu.) 

We will not return here."}
{"text":"I wish I could have eaten more! Stopped here with either a Yelp Deal or Groupon, can't remember which, during a long road trip last summer. My wife and I had just spent some time hiking around the Superstition Mountains and the heat had really drained us. We brought our two dogs along, and they were willing to let us have them in the patio seating area, but it was full. So, we ate inside and left the dogs in the car - the sun had gone down at that point. The portions were enormous! And so tasty! I wish I could go back right now!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It really does have the best mariscos! I love the ceviche and my husband is a fan of the fried fish! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Most excellent food the best Baja seafood anywhere.best of the best sooooo happy everything was great as usual mmmm"}
{"text":"First time there, what a surprise. Restaurant is loud with the music playing, I liked it. If you  prefer quiet places to eat then do not come here. Service was a little bit slow, but we were in no hurry so it did not bother us. Started out with the bean dip, nice and spicy, chips were fresh. Had the fajata\"s and Arroz Marnero, shrimp. octopus, fish, clams, crab and scallops. The food was awesome, except for the octopus which was chewy, otherwise wonderful. Kind of looks like a  hole in the wall from the outside but it will be worth your time once you step inside. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food at great prices...very authentic and you can get some \"unusual\" stuff too if you like...I had the shrimp and steak fajitas and they were super tasty and plenty of food."}
{"text":"Stopped  in for lunch  Had shredded beef taco rice and beans...  Very good, and the chips and salsa were great! We will be back."}
{"text":"I had ordered shrimp tacos and they literally only gave me 3 shrimps with nothing in it wrapped in a soft tortilla .no sauce nothing else with it just plain shrimp. The tortillas were also dry and cracked .horrible. not worth going again ."}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican. If you were blindfolded being driven here...you wouldn't know the difference. Friendly staff all the way around. Try the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Posole is the best ever. Service is really good. Live music on Fridays. Really good prices."}
{"text":"we found this on a whim and because it was open early! the food is fantastic, there are six of us and we all loved it! I ordered the ceviche and sadly it was not the best ever, but was still good. It was watery and just shrimp, I had to order avacado extra. The rest had enchildas, fish tacos, quesedillas and chorizo!! all great! my parents thought it a bit loud, they are in their 70's! All in all a good experience!!!"}
{"text":"The very best sea bass salad! I don't use the salad dressings offered; however, I do use the salsa!! Paired with the chips, I have the best meal ever! I also pass on the raw onions .. just my personal preference! Delicious light meal without the guilt associated with  heavy Mexican fare! The wait staff, without exception, excel at customer service each and every time we frequent this venue! Charming, hidden,  little secret in Mesa!"}
{"text":"Baja Joe's is one of my favorite restaurants.  The menu is extensive, with many items you will not easily find elsewhere.  There are many seafood dishes to chose from, as well as fajitas, burritos, tacos and the other Mexican food standards.
Baja Joe's also has weekly specials and lunch specials.  For weekly specials, Monday Hamburgers, Tuesday Tacos (of course), Wednesday wings (one of the items I have not tried), Thursday fajitas, and Friday fish and chips. 
One of my favorites, are the breaded shrimp taco's which on Tuesday are $2.50 each.  You have to love Taco Tuesdays.
Another one of my favorites are the shrimp fajitas.  On Thursdays all fajitas are $9.99 and this is a really good deal.  To make it even better, check in with Yelp for $5 off a bill of $25 or more.
Baja Joe's has a good selection of house drinks and the large ones are really large.  So far all the drinks I have tried have been good.
One of the really nice things about Baja Joe's is that the are open past 9 PM.  So if you are working late, you are not limited to fast food for dinner.
Finally, if you are luck enough, you may get our favorite server Linda.  She is awesome and you should always request her.
I hope you enjoy this restaurant as much as we do."}
{"text":"Thank you for reviewing my review.  However, you stated that the gratuity only applies to parties of 8 or more or checks of $100 or more.  I WAS charged a gratuity when there was only 4 of us and my bill was nowhere near $100.  You may want to check and make sure your staff knows your rules."}
{"text":"The customer service is getting worse each time we visit. We used to visit 3+ times a month, the food is good but if you cant get your condiments or another refill...."}
{"text":"Had awesome time celebrating no kids at home. Iris our waitress  was an amazing  server food was great even though ate off the happy hour menu, had a fun time."}
{"text":"On a whim, we decided to try Baja Joe's. I was slightly skeptical as the shopping center it is in is old and houses a thrift store and some other oddities. However,  upon walking i was surprised to see how spacious the bar area and dining room were. The bar area had lots of tables ranging from high tops to big banquet tables. There was also a ton of flat screens and a darts game. 

We sat ourselves at the bar and were greeted by  of the many bartenders. She was quite friendly and helped with my indecisiveness with my drink order. I got a Corona-Rita, a margarita with a baby corona in it. It was huge and well made; not overly sweet or too strong. For food, I got a 3 item combo so I could t one ry a variety of items. It had a grilled fish taco, shrimp taco and cheese enchilada with rice and beans. Both tacos were amazing; they were fresh and had a ton of flavor. The cheese enchilada was oozing with cheese and the red sauce was slight spicy and not sweet like canned enchilada sauce. The beans and rice were on point, which is indicative of a good Mexican restaurant in my opinion. My boyfriend ordered two beef tacos, which were braised in some type of sauce making the meat tender and delicious.

One of the owners was helping clear tables and asked how things were. I told him it was our first time and it was a good one. He was happy to hear and gave us a coupon to use for next time. Such great customer service. 

Overall, it was a pleasant surprise and I can see myself frequenting here often and you should to."}
{"text":"Just came back from an amazing dinner  here.   The food was amazing---guacamole, frijoles, the homemade chips and salsa, the fried filet of fish, the menudo.  OMG.  Why can I have a second stomach?   The young lady who served us was super pleasant and super responsive to our requests.  

Last night while I was reviewing the online Yelp menu so I could figure out what I wanted to eat tonight, I saw a number of negative reviews which I feel compelled to address. 
 
I have been to Baja Joe's many, many times, at least 25 times that I can remember.  I have always seen couples and sometimes complete families with lots of children.  I am referring to the review that warns people about bringing their children to Baja Joe's.  I will tell you that I have never seen a Baja Joe's staffer or manager or owner, being rude to anyone's child even though in my humble opinion something should have been said to some of them.  

Parents allow their kids to do things in a restaurant that I know they would not allow their children to do in their own home.  I have watched while kids scream their heads off and the parents ignore it.   I have watched as  kids throw their food on the floor and no parent or family member bothers to pick it up.  I have watched while kids run through the aisles of the restaurant while waiters and waitresses are carrying heavy loads of food back and forth to the kitchen.  I have watched while parents put their toddlers' bottoms on tables where people are expected to eat.  A little gross would you not say?   So this is in defense of Baja Joe's (in which I hold no financial interest, nor do I even know the owner) with regard to that review telling people not to bring their children here.  They are more than tolerant of the ill-bred children whose parents ignore their abysmal behavior.  

In NY, I go to an italian restaurant which has the following posted on each of its walls:
  Children are welcome here.  Parents are in charge of supervising their children.  Please control your child's behavior and the noise level because the patrons who pay to eat here expect to enjoy their meal.  If your child is crying, please step outside until your child is under control.   Thank you.   

The other review says that Baja Joe's only has bottled sauces and not fresh salsas.  INCORRECT.  Baja Joe's has fresh sauces and fresh chips every day and they are complementary.  They are absolutely delicious and fresh.  So the reviewer is INCORRECT.  

I wanted to set the record straight, from my point of view of course, because I don't like UNFAIR or untruthful reviews."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating here, and it was excellent! I'm very picky when it comes to Mexican food but Baja Joe's nailed it. My server Kaitlin was awesome! It was refreshing to be met with such hospitality!!!! Food here was delicious and you get started with chips and salsa! And our server was awesome with giving recommendations. I will be coming here more often plus it is close by to where I live! Thank you so much Kaitlin for serving my family, YOU ROCK!!"}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican seafood cuisine! Fine dining at a wonderful atmosphere with friendly wait staff and great foods! Will come again!!!!"}
{"text":"Just awful! After 20 minutes I had to ask for a server. 15 minutes later we got a drink. Food had no flavor and had no drink with our food. Should have walked out on our check! DO NOT EAT HEAR!"}
{"text":"This was seriously some of the worst Mexican food I've ever eaten. The salsa had no flavor at all (and we were also surprised to find that they charge for chips and salsa). I ordered a one-item combo with an enchilada and my husband got the steak chimichanga. Both were very disappointing! The enchilada sauce had NO flavor and the meat in both meals was not well seasoned at all. The steak in the chimi was also quite tough. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because our server was pretty attentive, checking in frequently and making sure drinks were refilled."}
{"text":"This place has the most diverse food for a sea food restaurant. Most places Sea food tastes the same but in a different name. Not here, every dish has its own flavor."}
{"text":"Go here and try everything. Seriously, the tacos are phenomenal, the burritos are exceptionally good, the drink specials are great. Do yourself a favor and go!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Get the bacon wrapped shrimp stuffed peppers they are amazing. The fish tacos and pork tacos are also really good. I don't think I've tried anything here I don't like. They also make a great michalada, and margarita. :-)"}
{"text":"Not a bad place. 

1. Do not, under any circumstance order the oysters on the half shell.  This is not an oyster house. I tried to explain this to my friend. If the menu is 5 pages long and there's no other oyster dish on the menu and nobody is ordering oysters, they probably aren't that fresh. the 12 oysters came out with about 40 chunks of lime over the top. Served on a bed of ice but not cold. Terrible, bad. I sent them back, they weren't comped. I ate one and later in the evening, I suffered for it. 

On the good side. Friendly service. Cold beers, Decent prices.  The bacon wrapped, shrimped stuffed jalapenos were so good. Stick with those. I think they are called Toridos.
 Fresh guac is was solid. 

It's right down the street from our new house. I must say, there are many things I miss about the Biltmore / Arcadia area but access to good food and local businesses is first on the list. Mesa needs to step up its restaurant and bar game. This and the Outback are the only options within walking distance."}
{"text":"I love this place, everything is so tasty and fresh. My only complaint is that it's too far away and I can't get there as often as I would like."}
{"text":"Baja Joe? More like Baja NO!

The food is like any other run of the mill Mexican food restaurant out there. Nothing really to write home about but it isn't terrible either.  The one thing I have to complain about thought is the AWFUL service! As soon as our food came out, our server couldn't be bothered to grab us water or even our check once our meal was done. We sat for at least 15min after someone else came to clear our table before our server even came back to check in on us. Once we could finally grab her attention she dropped the check, I instantly put my card down and said it was ready for her to take, she glared at me and walked away without even picking up our payment. RUDE! Seriously, costumer service can make or break an experience and the lack of attention (in a nearly empty restaurant) is inexcusable. I always try to cut servers slack because I know bad days happen, but you've got to draw the line somewhere. I for one, have no desire to give this place another shot."}
{"text":"Great food!  Took my kids for lunch last weekend, food and service was amazing!  Fun atmosphere!!!  Fabulous chips, salsa and fish tacos!  Best in town.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good time at Baja Joes... I love the chicken chimichanga. They have good margaritas too."}
{"text":"Chips are stale and salsa is bland. Rest of food has no flavor. Stay away from here if you like flavorful and spicy Mexican food. Haven't had food this bad in a long while."}
{"text":"Once again Baja Joes has done nothing more then please the palette. And our waitress Faby was more then a wonderful server. Thank you again"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere, the staff is friendly and the food is authentic.  I eat there as often as I can.  Thank you Baja Joe's!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great atmosphere! Great service! I met a friend for happy hour and was blown away by Baja Joe's. Danny Vouga was our bartender/ server and she was attentive and accurate. I couldn't have asked for more. The restaurant and bathrooms were clean and in great shape. (Not something you find all the time now, unfortunately.) Prices are a little higher, but I am willing to pay for good seafood, great atmosphere, and great service! Will recommend to all I know! And be back for HH again!"}
{"text":"Our favorite neighborhood Mexican restaurant - world's better than Serrano's or Abuelo's which we used to frequent. Huge menu, good prices, gigantic portions, and very good service. The chips are usually very tasty, as well as the salsa (a little chunky, a little sweet). The fajitas easily make 5-6 from a single order, so great for sharing - and on Thursdays, they're only $9.99 (I always order the shrimp fajitas and it's always full of shrimp). You definitely get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. It wasn't really all that busy yet I had to ask for silverware and refills. Waited a good 20 minutes or so to be acknowledged for our check. If I was the type of person to walk out without paying it would have been very easy to do. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"The seafood is phenomenal the Ambiance is great what more can I say. Great people,  great service and magnificent food and drinks."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is awesome and the service is even greater with Michael as our bartender made the difference of being a good restraunt to an even better one...love this place...we will be back over and over!!!"}
{"text":"I eat here all the time!! So good! Love the Chipotle Shrimp! Also the service is awesome! Girls there so sweet.."}
{"text":"we went fri. may  25,2018, the worst place to eat.  took 2 friends they stated they will never return, I can't blame them  the service was awful  1,99 for chips and salsa,meals were cold, I can't say anything good about the place.they have lost us as customers for ever."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times now, and I've decided to like it, it took a few times to get past the fishy smell, but what do u expect when the serve a ton of seafood ? So my best bite so far is the ceviche tostada! Is piled high with the toppings and the tostadas stay crunchy, next awesome guacamole fresh made in house. I'm not a fan of many of the lunch plates I've tried the tacos and chimi. Bar tenders are quick and the have many options. Even if you are late for happy hour drinks are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Long day at work, and all i wanted to do was go to Bajas for takeout not delivery. Cute lil girl at the counter said \" its Mexican Mother's Day and we are very busy let me check with the kitchen\". She returns with \" Sorry we can't do takout today\". I said \" Well can i sit at a table and order\" ? She said \" Yes but, you have to eat it here \" .   Well guess what i did?  I went to Sharkys and boy was it good ."}
{"text":"Bacon wrapped crab stuffed shrimp, spicy cerviche (sp?), delish Mexican beer served with salt and lime, casual experience with a nice patio.  When I am looking for a little seafood and some day drinking this is the place for me.  It is pretty bare bones, but it is clean and well run, my service has always been great, but I usually sit at the bar.  Try this little place out, you will be very happy you did."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to eat. A little pricey and I am not Hispanic so I don't know how to read the menu but overall good experience."}
{"text":"I went here with a few friends. I was sitting at the bar with a few friends. One of my good friends was a little drunk, and started to get handsy with me. I was told him to stop, I was uncomfortable. He did stop immediately. BUT, the barback, Nick, or Mick ( it was kinda loud) saw and looked at me and asked if I was ok. Then told my friend it's her decision if you stay or leave. I told him we were fine, but later pulled him aside and told him how much I appreciated him to making sure I was safe. I honestly feel he would have done that for me whether I was a man or woman. I will continue to come to this establishment because of him, and i just wanted people to know that as long as he is in the building, you have a safe person there to have your back! Thank you again! You are amazing!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in this place. I went for music with friends and the venue was new to me. 

The set up in the long, narrow bar is bizarre, with high-top tables up close to the stage blocking the view of everyone at the low tables behind. The noise level was ridiculously high, with lots of TVs playing sports competing with the music. The acoustics were also very strange.

The service was atrocious. I waited 10 minutes to even catch the eye of a waitress. She immediately told me they were out of chips and salsa. This is a Mexican restaurant for heaven sake! How can you run out of chips and salsa. 

Once I ordered my tableside guacamole it took over an hour to get it, and once it came it was unmemorable, bland with a couple of unexpected spots of fiery chili. My fellow music lovers had similar experiences with the service and food.

I hate to say it, because I love to support venues that feature live music, but I will not be back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow who knew you could get Fresh Seafood in the desert.  Our family loves seafood and Baja Joes has now become our favorite place to enjoy it.  We stumbled on this in search for a good lunch spot for the family this past Saturday.  Glad I take some reviews of this place with a grain of salt and tried it for ourselves.  Eva our server was awesome.  Yes you do tend to wait a bit longer for your meals but when they make it all fresh to order that is what you get.  We had the tableside quac and was fabulous.  3 of us split this Seafood sampler with red floured fish that was so moist and amazing, shrimp cooked to perfection, along with grilled and breaded fish cooked to perfection.  The chipotle sauce was outstanding.  Our daughter had the chicken taco salad and loved it.  Flan and fried ice cream to end with what was not to love.  This will definitely be a returning spot for us loved the patio area."}
{"text":"This Mariscos place is as good as it gets, we eat seafood all the time and have tried many places but nothing beats here! 
Anything you get in the menu is filling and tastes great! Service is always good and attentive. If you are looking for a good Seafood place you will not regret choosing this place. Plates may be a little on the high end but its so good you will be back!"}
{"text":"Food tonight was good as usual.   I've never gotten a bad meal.   And I have 17 check ins.   I love this place.   But service tonight was horrible.   No silverware or napkins while eating our chips until we were done with them despite asking.  Salsa Bowl was left empty for a good long time.  It took 40 minutes to get our meal.   Just bad.   Not sure if I'll be rushing back."}
{"text":"Very yummy food and friendly atmosphere. They had very good shrimp in the shrimp quesadilla and shrimp salad - good size and nice and firm. Guacamole was delicious. Our party also had a bean burrito and a chicken quesadilla. Their tortillas  are good! We will be back."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Don't try to watch Sunday football here! We show up at 9am every Sunday because we know that if we do, the bartender will try to accommodate us and put the games we want to watch on a couple TVs for us. Well, this past Sunday, we and a few others who showed up early had talked to our bartender, all agreed on the four games to put up over the bar and were set. Enter some blonde we've never seen before. She walks behind the bar, talks to one lady who decided to dictate what games needed to be on and she changed everything. She ended up with the same game on two of the screens, was rude and didn't care what anyone else wanted. We've been going there for football for a few years and never had problems when Dani and the other girls were there, as well as the male manager whose name I cannot remember. We were already on the fence about leaving this place because every other time we are there the owner comes in and makes everyone at the bar move down for his friends. With so few places in Mesa to go anyway, it's pretty sad to see that they don't care about those who have shown loyalty. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is awesome good food music and ambience. Will definitely be back! Ana was my waitress and she was awesome from advising me and my husband what all the menu items were and helping with my 10 month old son. My new Mariscos place!"}
{"text":"Baja Joes is AH-MAZING. I used to complain that I lived far away from good restaurants but then I discovered Baja Joes! Every single menu item I have tried was outstanding.  I look forward to Taco Tuesday each week.  Also love Fajita Thursday!  The shrimp cocktails are exactly like in Rocky Point.  I seriously love this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the 1st time this week. The food here was very good! Especially the carne adobada! The wait staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Sucks!!!
Big Prices ---  Small Portions!!!

What Mexican Restaurant charges for chips and salsa? THEY DO!!! Rip Off. When asked why they charge, they stated it's because minimum wage went up. Well, that's the prices of business. You're still making at least 70% profit off your food prices. 

Next, on our specific visit, the food portions were small. The combination platters were so small we laughed. Ordered a salad along with the meal and they have 2 dressings, WTF? Ranch & Chipotle? That's it! Really? If you offer salad, you better have various salad dressings! 

On top of this cheapness, they give you 3 tortillas with your meal..  Yes, I did say 3! They are smaller than your hand but yet they will charge you for more. 

And I can't forget they charge you for salsa!!!! That's like charging for ketchup on a hamburger!!!!  

Here's the best idea----Save your time, money and aggravation and don't go here, go right around the corner to Rosa's!!!!

OH, and before I forget, the service sucked. They waitress was more concerned about doing her side work than attending to any of her tables. Not to mention when she came to refill my drink it was only because I had to chase her down but she still didn't refill my buddies drink."}
{"text":"Friends, family, and neighbors rave about Baja Joe's.  My first visit here was May, 2018. I ordered Fish Tacos - Excellent!  They said they use Chilean Sea Bass. The small flour tortillas were thin and delicious (not too thick and dough like), topped with tender, seasoned grilled fish, cilantro, lettuce, cabbage, and a side of varied greens, plus refried beans and rice.  And they make a good Margarita.  Very tasty. It's my new favorite place."}
{"text":"Surprisingly a good place. Tasty shredded meat and lots of sea food. Fish and chips were really good with the Baja sauce."}
{"text":"Super good.  Civiche was great, service was on point.  I just wish I asked for a hotter salsa."}
{"text":"This place has a mix of everything - Mexican, Tex-Mex, Seafood, American, and is a sports bar with sports on every television. Their beer list is pretty standard, nothing to write home about. I got a Blue Moon. As for the food, it is just ok. The salsa was lacking the proper spices, kinda bland. I got the shrimp fajita burrito. It was edible and filled me up, but I have definitely had better Mexican food at other establishments. As for the service, our waiter was exceptional. He was always there when we seemed to need him, and very personable and polite."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with anything from the menu
Everything is authentic and tasty, 
but unfortunately not the corn tortillas. 
That's why I'm taking out one star...
The staff is friendly and attentive. 
Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"Friday night lights here at Baja Joes!  Sports on, cold beer on sale, homemade Mexican food, & full bar.  Check in discounts when you spend $25 of more. How can you beat this!  Menudo on Sat. & Sun.  Music, and did I say cold beer?"}
{"text":"Food is actually really good and oddly the best wings I think I have ever had.

Fajitas we enjoy but overall everything we have had has been good.  It is a step up from your Garcias type restaurant.

Only issue we have with it is it is a difficult place to bring a toddler.  Just always seems loud and a little chaotic, but I guess it is a cantina!

The service is usually decent."}
{"text":"Great food, great service from the singing waitress also! Loved the Atmosphere! Seafood was on point"}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant in Arizona. Up there in quality with the Mexican from SoCal. Get the carne asada plate. Perfection. Ask for the hot salsa. Also perfection. Always good service. I use an entertainment coupon and always tip well on it. See--good business practices, you got me in the door 6 years ago and I've been a happy customer since then. I've brought different friends and family here and every person has loved it. One issue. It's NOT cool NICKEL AND DIMING me for *chips* as of January 2018. Maybe put on your menu: \"Free chips with any entree purchase\". Problem solved. Don't make ME, who orders an entree, and often an appetizer (tableside guacamole--flawless, with the perfect amount of salt and ingredient ratios--and I've had it at many places) pay for chips. It doesn't make sense and I feel less inclined to get an appetizer, drinks, or tip as much. Consider changing your policy. Other than that, 5/5, 10/10, don't change a thing!"}
{"text":"Food was great!  Beer was great!  Service was great!  I would give it a 5 but both times I've been there in the last two weeks my order was wrong.  I didn't complain because the food was really good."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is consistently delicious! Service is wonderful. They really pay attention to whatever you want. I'm addicted to the peel and eat shrimp. So fresh. I could eat there every day! Waitress Faby  is the best"}
{"text":"Decided to have dinner here since it's so close to home plus a co-worker of my wife \"highly recommended \" it. 
Service was spotty.  Took 5 mins or so before our drink orders were taken. We had to ask for water with our chips n salsa. 
Blue margarita was good the michelada (sp) was ok.  
Dinner arrived before our ceviche app. Wish we'd ordered the small one because the ceviche was bland and boring. Lacked salt. We left 3/4 of it uneaten. 
Wife and daughter ordered bean n cheese burritos and they were good but it's hard to mess that up. I ordered the fish filet in culichi sauce. Very small filets in a watered down version of culichi sauce. I could even see tiny bubbles in the sauce that verified it had been \"reduced\". Bland but edible. 
Flour tortillas were supposed to come with my order but they never materialized. At that point I didn't even ask for them.  
If you want a really authentic Mexican seafood meal go to Mariscos Sinaloa in Mesa. Yelp it, it'll come up."}
{"text":"I have driven by this restaurant everyday for the past several years and never given it a thought.  Last night I tried it and all I can say is wow.  Started off with a Patron margarita, which was very well made.  I had a fish and shrimp taco.  Both tasted extremely fresh.  My wife had the fish diablo, and it was the highlight of the table.  The diablo sauce is fantastic.  Give this restaurant a chance, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had lunch here last week.  The place was packed but we were seated right away.  Its a big restaurant.  Food was good.  Got the baja lunch burrito combo.  Chips and salsa were also good.  The service was fine,  quick and easy place to grab lunch.  I'm not much of a seafood person but this place has a huge seafood selection!!"}
{"text":"Steak fajitas were good but the Chicken were better.  Some of the best chicken fajitas I have ever eaten.  Top that off with great service and a $5 coupon and I'm in love with this place."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! Husband & I usually order chicken fajitas, flour tortillas and a draft beer. Absolutely delicious every single time we go there both during lunch or dinner. Comes with guacamole and the freshest salsa, tortillas and chips in town. All the pretty servers do a great job!"}
{"text":"It's right near my house so we tried it out. The food is good. They have different specials for almost every day of the week, which is nice. They also have a nice happy hour and Margarita Wednesday! We just moved to AZ three weeks ago and have been here twice already. It's a nice atmosphere and the staff are friendly as well."}
{"text":"Well we learned that they had live music this weekend and we knew one of the guys playing that night, so we took our first trip to Baja Joes.

Saturday night 10pm.........pretty dead. I don't know if that was the bars fault or the bands, like I've said, this was our first time.  Maybe 20 people. 
So on that note, it's a GREAT stage for bands to play on. Volume was perfect and a pretty big dance floor too. 
All in all, it's an odd combo.  It's a seafood restaurant/Mexican food, with a SUPER long bar and a giant stage. Then it has all the kitchy things on the wall, fish, signs etc. It has the perfect set up and layout to make it a kick ass rock and roll bar if ever converted. 
Bar staff was super attentive and friendly. At the last minute before they closed the kitchen we ordered a quesadilla. So my judgement on the food......I really can't give an a opinion......it was a quesadilla.
I'd love to give Baja Joes another shot, I'll wait to see who the next band is!"}
{"text":"This is my local mexican food bar. I really like the happy hour.  They have a $6 burro and beer.  If not in the the mood for Mexican you can get a burger or chicken strips.  They have other specials as well.  They have live music in Thursday nights starting around 6? Good vibe and nice people.  It's my regular spot."}
{"text":"Really good ceviche tostadas! And great customer service! The waitress was really prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"We had the seafood special.  It was awful.  The chips and salsa are amazing.  Never returning."}
{"text":"Um, no stars. Such a bad experience, we didnt even stay because we were afraid to eat anything incase they spit in our food. So, night started off bad with the front counter girl being more interested in flirting with her coworker than seating us. Then she proceeds to tell us the dinning section is closed, and we have to sit in the bar. (Not true we later found out as the dinning area closes at 9, and it was barely 830). Then we go to sit in the bar area, and the music was so loud we could not have a conversation. Then we moved to an area a little further away from the singer, who we were told his last song was at 845, and he sang till we left, at 9. Then, we got our food and went to dig in to our nachos, only to see a lovely long dark, slightly curly hair across the sour cream and pulled it out from inside the guacamole. So, we attempted to flag down anyone(no one seemed to be around) and the gal who finally came over actually asked if we wanted the food changed out. I am holding the freaking hair in my hand!!!!! Yes, I want it changed out!!!!! So she brings out the \"new\" plate, and it looked exactly like the one we had just sent back, including the dents where we had pulled out 2 chips before noticing the hair....we were afraid to eat the food incase they did anything to the food. Our waitress came back (she was missing when we found the hair) and said she heard that we found a Blonde hair. (My friend and I both have light hair).We stopped her there and let her know it wasnt blonde, it was dark. It was wound into the food, it was not ours! The service was terrible, and I will never ever go back. Seriously, you are going to ask if I want a replacement for food that had hair in it?! Never again. Oh, and they still charged us $5.46 for our two sodas that we didn't even get refills on."}
{"text":"Food, once we got it was good.  Service was horrible!  Our server was new.  And although very nice it seemed the kitchen was making it difficult for her to do her job properly.  Our food took 50 minutes to come out and was incorrect when it did.  We came to see the band and they were great."}
{"text":"A very quick place for a cheap dine in lunch atmosphere. All specials are $6.99 at lunch and a drink can be added for an additional $2. I would not recommend the tacos, poor tortillas, but the enchiladas are a hit! Nothing too fancy about the free chips and salsa or service- everything is just average. I've seen the happy hour menu and drink selection and would definitely go back for a good time."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite Mexican food restaurant. The fish tacos are INCREDIBLE and I'm obsessed with their chipotle sauce. They have excellent fajitas, as well. Everything I've tried from here has been perfect and I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for some good food."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I like this place a lot, we've been here a few times in the past year and have really enjoyed the seafood enchiladas, the whole tilapia and the queso fundido! Also the \"la pinta\" margaritas! 
We had Ana as our server and she was amazing, so friendly, so helpful and always had a smile on her face! We really loved having her as a part of our dinner experience and will be back hopefully to sit in her section again!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Authentic mexican food and decent prices. It's a match made in heaven. It's so authentic that there are murals on the walls. 

My 2-year old had the chicken nuggets with beans. She ate most of it, which is rare for a 2-yr old. My hubby and I split the nachos and each had a carnitas plate. The nachos had tender carne asada, guacamole, sour cream, and a good amount of white nacho cheese. Delicious! Then the carnitas plate came with unlimited homemade, yes homemade, flour tortillas. The meat was in big chunks which is preferred over the pre-shredded version we usually get from other places. On the side, was a little salad, rice, and beans. All of it tasted like something I would get from those great dives in LA. 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Coke and Mexican food go so good together! Switching to Pepsi just cost you our business.  We used to come at leaonce a week but not anymore"}
{"text":"Received an odd email from this establishment I just reviewed on my dining club web site. I see where the owners have also responded to others here previously in similar fashion. This is disconcerting as I explicitly followed the posting guidelines ( which call for authenticity, accuracy and relevancy) in my review. There is definitively a  condescending and trivializing undertone of defensiveness  throughout his reply... oh, and I never said I \"loved\" this place.... and his falling back on the argument of authenticity is relative anyway, I was recently in Oaxaca City's Zocalo and this was allowed in some cafes, but not many. I was merely reporting what did and didn't appeal to us and others there, your mileage may differ! I didn't mean to \"tear\" anyone up.

i'm really sorry that one bad experience (with music and ambiance no less) was enough to forget about all your love of our place and to tear us up with such a poorly rated review ...Maybe you don't know how detrimental a review like that is for a business. We do allow the musicians to come in here and there to play for tips, just like in Mexico...it adds to our authenticity for most folk, sorry it did not sit well with you. Hopefully you come back and if you really enjoy our place and think so much more of it, you can decide to rates us differently...but maybe just be conscience of the overall rating as it really hinders good business. And I guess to part, you have one issue with ambiance and you stop coming? I guess that means maybe you were not that in love after all. sorry to hear, we'd love to be there for your nourishment.

{"text":"Baja Joes is a decent place to eat, but it doesn't stand out to me. 

Drinks are well-priced and the food is okay, plus the outdoor area is nice when the weather permits. 

If you're looking for a place to get decent food and drinks, this will do the trick."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, awesome food and ownership. If you are looking for the full package in restaurant/bar this is the place!"}
{"text":"We agree that the table side Guac was fantastic - 5stars for this.
The carne sada was like beef jerky & the management didn't care to come talk to us to resolve the issue. 
The Resturant wasn't as busy to not have silverware or water upon request. 

Our waitress was helpful & nice. 
Room for improvement but not a terrible place."}
{"text":"We live across the street from Baja Joe's and really we waited two years to try it!  I'm not sure why we waited so long to try this place, but now it's our go to quick fix for nachos and margaritas.  Our first time was great, the service was quick and responsive, the food was really good.  I suggest trying the nachos with carnitas and ceviche is also tasty!  Our 6 year old daughter orders a plain hamburger every time we visit Baja's and she loves it.  I also like that they have a large patio on the side for those great spring time nights!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm I have a feeling there are some serious trolls you know who you are leaving negative reviews (obviously because there aren't that many!) my bartender/server was Dani??? Anyway she was amazing she totally hooked up me and my friend with great 'Skinny margaritas' that did not taste skinny at all. Now before I review the food I will have you know I am a Latina SoCal transplant who is serious about my Mexican food all I have to taste is the refried beans and the chips and salsa to know if it is a great restaurant or not. Check on both! But it didn't stop there. Ceviche tostada probably the best I've ever had and that includes my favorite little spot in Rosarito puerto Nuevo. Only other place that ever came close to this is la Perla in Glendale and they are closed now so I guess I will be driving out to Gilbert more often!"}
{"text":"Excellent!! The waitress even got my order wrong, but what she gave me looked so delicious, I didn't send it back, and it was fabulous! I still to this day don't know what I was actually given.

Great seafood (not fishy tasting at all!), great Mexican, great salsa, and I'll go there again."}
{"text":"15 minutes in , it's Packed in here , and we've been served and have eaten our apps and with awesome timing the waitress shows up with our dinners ! GREAT SERVICE"}
{"text":"I loved the food . The salsa is wicked good . Our server was extremely attentive , funny and courteous . We will definitely be back ! Thank you for everything ."}
{"text":"The food is original, the staff could not have been friendlier, the atmosphere authentic mexican.  Excellent restaurant for fun and food.  But, get there early as it's a very popular place.  I suggest going betwen 5-6 pm in order to get a table.  Have fun!9"}
{"text":"A lengthy drive from my home in Chandler but worth it!  In large shopping center, easy parking.  Staff is friendly and efficient with good service.  Sports bar atmosphere with several large flat screens, a well stocked bar and adjacent dining room. Tables and seating was clean and comfortable.  We ordered a large shrimp and octopus cocktail, a 5 star dish, loaded with the seafood, crunchy cucumber, tomato juice, etc.,very tasty and filling, and only $13, and Bacanora, described as shrimp in mildly spiced cheese sauce, served with rice, potato slices and salad, a 3 star dish, ($14) with 6 medium shrimp despite the fact that the menu photo had twice as many shrimp, and no spiciness at all. We drank the House Margarita, $6 as it was happy hour (3-6pm).  Also had the house wine at $3.50 a glass.  We closed with Sopapillas with powdered sugar and honey, only average.  We will return to try their fish, looked and smelled pretty good."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times. They have a very large menu of mexican food, and a large selection of seafood dishes. It's good. Service is usually pretty good, once a little slow. The food is good, not great, not bad."}
{"text":"This place was so yummy! Loved the jalapeno poppers with shrimp & the oysters. I ordered the coconut shrimp cocktail but it was kind of bland, had to add a ton of hot sauce to get flavor. They give you all of the coconut tho including the shaved coconut inside & Coconut milk. Place is pricey tho!"}
{"text":"The service has been horrible at the bar on just too many occasions. They are often slow to acknowledge you or to cash you out, and you can forget about expecting a warm and welcoming experience. I ignored it and watched whatever ballgame I was there to see. I tried high tips to turn the behavior around but no luck. You know the entitled type of bartender type? Why give these kind of people your hard-earned money? No soap to wash hands with in any of the bathroom soap dispensers on multiple occasions. Definitely not a good sign in terms of concern for cleanliness."}
{"text":"In my opinion Baja Joes serves the best seafood in Mesa I have yet to find another restaurant that can top it."}
{"text":"What are you kidding me I love this place the food the staff from top to bottom dedication is so wonderful to see and experience it!  I so enjoy bringing my family & friends to taste the delicate flavors of the baja.  So comfortable and laid back I feel we are at a friends home I am not in a rush to leave ....ummm may have to order some thing else please .....shout out to our favorite friend FABI we told her that when she was born her parents took one look at her and they said she was

Fabulous hence \"FABI\"!!!! Gosh hope I spelled her name right anyway you must stop in you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"The food was really good, and the environment is fun. We went on a Friday night, so of course there was a bit of a wait. We opted to eat on the patio rather than wait 30 minutes for a table inside. It was nice until people started smoking out there. Apparently they allow smoking on the patio. If we had known that, we would not have chosen to eat outside. Other than that, great food!"}
{"text":"Best sea food in the east valley. I go there all the time the food is fresh and taste very good."}
{"text":"Ok, sooo we have been in this area for over 1 yr and decided to try Baja Joes for the 1st time. I give it 2 stars.  We always find a taco place on my moms birthday, which is today. To honor her memory with her favorite foid, The TACO.  When we entered, they were very crowded but seated us quickly, 1 star.  The waitress explained TACO Tues to us but we ordered combos instead. 1 star. It is downhill from here. We ordered food and within 7 minutes it arrived. Can be a mixed signal when the dining room is full. The tacos were ground beef,  crunchy shell with double rice for me. My hubby had soft tacos with rice and beans. Niw, immediately when he picked up his soft taco, it fell apart. IT WAS SOGGY!!  the ground beef was prepared with chunks of carrots.. waaaaa?????  The meat gad absolutely no FLAVOR. the rice was  bland and full of mushy carrots and what appeared to be red bell peppers.  Not soo good.  We took what chips were brought to the table and made nachos with tge beans and rice. No way i was paying for a combo plate and not eating it all...  The service was not spectacular, we were done with our meal before the waitress ever came back.  we will NOT be back."}
{"text":"We love Baja Joe's! Cute patio that is relaxing with nice adirondack-style chairs and low tables for relaxing with drinks as well as booths and tables for dining. Misters and cover make it bearable in the summer, and always great in the winter. Salsa is deliciously fresh. Every time I have gone, I have had a seafood dish and none have disappointed. All wait staff has been friendly and even humor my kids (that love telling silly jokes). I have had the chef come to my table a few times to see how we liked the food - always great!

My fave dishes:
Kids fish nuggets
Stuffed peppers
Seafood in coconut
Seafood rice."}
{"text":"Really good authentic style Mexican food.  Great hole in the wall type of place.  Traditional type of atmosphere.  Staff is friendly and somewhat informal."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  We had the beef fajitas.  The flour tortillas are made fresh  (not from a package ), so it may be a problem when I go to other places who don't do them fresh because this place has set the bar pretty high.  Iris,  our waitress was very friendly and provided excellent service.  We'll definitely be coming back while we are in the area"}
{"text":"Let me say that we love this place! However they missed the mark in a few cases the other night when we brought some friends there. First of all, it's way too loud in there! Second, all of our food was barely warm. The server had to take several plates back to the kitchen to reheat and even then, one plate was still only mildly warm. Third, it appears they now charge for their chips and salsa which used to be complementary. I don't have a problem paying for it, but I would have appreciated knowing before hand so we would have been given the choice. As far as I know, most Mexican restaurants provide a complementary salsa and chips, and frankly, with $75-$80 tab +20% tip, I would hope they would have kept it complementary. Will probably try another place next time."}
{"text":"Great Margaritas ,great fish and chips. Awesome quesadillas! We always sit outside and the atmosphere is fabulous."}
{"text":"A coworker and I came for a bite to eat during lunch on a weekday, and we weren't let down. Lola, our waitress, was awesome and on top of things. The salsa was tasty (a tad watery), and the chips were warm. The ceviche was a bit rubbery (mostly shrimp), but I still ate it. My fish tacos (fried, even though I asked for grilled) were okay, but you need to try their hot sauce and chipotle sauce in the squeeze bottles. They were so good! I would kill for the recipes. They definitely saved the tacos.

I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but it was definitely a solid choice for lunch. PS, there's $1 off if you check in on yelp :)"}
{"text":"They have $2 fish tacos on Tuesdays. And very good fish tacos at that. Excellent Mexican/Seafood place, reminds me of my hometown. Sometimes the customer service isn't fantastic but the food definitely makes up for it."}
{"text":"The food like Guacamole, fish tacos,, salsa and chips, oysters are not fresh, shrimp cocktail is good and most of the food is  delicious the wait time for food is avg. The waitress can be friendly."}
{"text":"First time at Baja Joes. Came for taco Tuesday. Big tacos with lots of meat, couldn't even eat three! Great value. Will go again."}
{"text":"Absolutely Baja fish tacos are fabulous and mariscos in a large glass with tortillas on the side and the chimichanga huge absolutely reminds me of being in Ensenada"}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly staff. I love everything I've ordered. Great bands on Friday nights. For good food and a good time check this place out."}
{"text":"I've been to Joe's many times.  One of the best things about it is the atmosphere and ambiance.  Very cantina....especially on the patio outside.  I'm obsessed with their toritos (bacon-wrapped shrimp-stuffed guerro peppers)...and the torito sauce is rediculously good.  They also have excellent grilled fish tacos that are so light and refreshing.  Shrimp cocktail is decent but I'd like less of a tomato-y flavor to the sauce...however, the shrimp is always plump and fresh.  The salsa is more of a seafood salsa.  In fact, I think seafood is Baja Joe's niche.  Don't go there ordering a taco and enchilada combo plate with rice and beans or you may be underwhelmed.  The seafood is where it's at."}
{"text":"Good service. Fresh chips and salsa my favorite is the fajitas. I like it mixed steak and shrimp. Good prices for a family venture."}
{"text":"The food was pretty solid. The place is just incredibly loud. Very friendly service, though we were a large group and one end of our table got a lot more attention than the other. 

Weak salsa with the chips. Try the Pozole or the Carne asada, neither was amazing, but both were quite good."}
{"text":"This white girl is in LOVE!! My mother lives about a mile away from Baja Joe's. We have never stopped to eat there in all the 18 years she has lived in the neighborhood. Last year I snagged a Groupon and took 2 coworkers there for lunch. It was....okay. I think the enjoyment lessened because of the unattentive waitress. The best expereince was the shrimp stuffed peppers wrapped in bacon. About 3 months ago I went again. This time I was just blown out of the water. The queso dip was yummy. The salsa tasted VERY FRESH. The carne asada quesadilla was meaty & cheesy. About 2 months ago I took my mother there. It was her first time. She fell in love too. She thought the seafood was delish. Well folks, I think she is addicted. She has been there 6 more times in the last 7 weeks. She has taken friends and family there to introduce them to Baja Joe's (making reservations each time to make sure there is seating). When you see Mexicans walk in, eat & have fun, you know you're at the right place! (You never see a Mexican eating at Taco Bell.) This place serves authentic homemade Mexican food and beats the chain-style restraunts HANDS DOWN!! Servers are pleasant and informative about the menu choices. Love me some Toritos De Camaron!!!"}
{"text":"Always great service!!! Feels like you're in Rocky Pointe when you walk in the doors. Food is fantastic!!!  The torritos are delicious!!! The patio will relax you!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try it on a whim tonight and we were not disappointed. It was noisy at first with a lot of kids in the restaurant (early Saturday evening) but the food was amazing and service was great. Loved the shrimp with chipotle sauce which had a little kick to it. Definitely will be returning! Can't wait to try a margarita and the ceviche or seafood cocktail."}
{"text":"Want to pay for chips & salsa, then come here!!!!  I guess we were \"supposed to see it on the menu.\"  Food is just ok.  Nothing to write home about whatsoever.  And a $6.00 for a happy hour margarita with tons of ice isn't that happy!!  LOL"}
{"text":"I'm actually jealous everyone else had such a good experience!  My experience...not so good.  My brother recommend this place and has been sent a nasty text message. 

We arrived for the game (I know, I don't know why I watch the Cards either) and had been told during the game, it was 1/2 off appetizers.  So, I got the Original Large Ceviche but it arrived 30 minutes after our arrival, and while we were sitting there steaming from not having received our meal.  Two other tables, one that arrived about 15 minutes after us, got their meals before us (even the ceviche they ordered and again, before we got ours).  So, we chilled a bit and took some bites of the ceviche...well...UGH...no deveining.  Most people would not notice because they cut the shrimp into small bites, but I always look for it.  Ewwww!  No reason not to devein, they charge enough for the item ($12.99), they should make it right!

Well, since our order never came, it was almost 40 minutes after we had ordered, we had 3 bowls of chips and salsa, watching a game I didn't enjoy nor understand (I don't speak Spanish) and we had to sit there and watch Soccer on (I think) Univision, (which I didn't understand since 1/2 price appetizers where for the Cards game), the little girl at the table next to me had let out her 8th high-pitched wail, we were done and left.   I left a tip for the water, chips and salsa, but I was NOT going to pay for yucky ceviche.  

It's not a place I would ever even give another chance too.  The food being brought to other tables didn't even look good, not impressed.  Go at your own risk, don't expect too much though.  

Again, this was my experience and it may or may not have been unique.  I would not go here again, and my brother owes me some gas money with a sprinkle for chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"Delicious! It turns into a night club on the other side where the bar is. The food was perfect and came out really fast! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have no idea where to start.... everything from the shrimp covered bacon, chips & salsa, baja burger, nachos and double wrapped carne asada burrito were on point.  I normally don't like Mexican food but this place was delicious and reasonably priced. Definitely a go see."}
{"text":"We took some friends of ours from England to Baja Joe's for a taste of Mexican food.  We were so disappointed.  The chips were not warm or crispy and the salsa was thin, soupy and tasteless.   Not a good start.  My husband and I shared Fajitas.  The chicken was completely dry, the steak was OK, and the shrimp was tasteless (although we had more shrimp than I expected).  We asked for a mixture of corn and flour tortillas.  The corn tortillas fell apart in my hands after two bites.  The flour tortilla was translucent and didn't taste good.  Oh well.  Our friends Tostada had a burned shell on the bottom.  They seemed to like their food, but we don't feel they really had a chance at really excellent Mexican food.  
I will say our server was attentive, pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars, down from 4 for the food because of the slow service. Good food, good setting with lots of TVs, excellent hot salsa.

I went here for lunch on a Saturday with family. We sat down and waited for quite a while before being acknowledged by any of the staff. The staff got our orders correct and responded to our requests, but always in a rather slow fashion. They certainly were in no hurry.

The food was good. We asked for the spicy salsa to go with the chips they bring out at the beginning of the meal, and it was probably my favorite thing from the whole meal (but challenged closely by the carnitas burro). Not only was it the spice level I like (decently spicy, but not uncomfortable), but the flavor was excellent. I ordered two tacos (one grilled fish and one chicken) and the carnitas burro. The fish taco was decent, although the piece of fish in it was rather small. The chicken made me a little unsure as to whether it was breaded and fried or grilled, but with some of that salsa on it, it was pretty decent. But the star of my meal was the carnitas burro. It had an excellent flavor to it, and the carnitas had a nice texture that carnitas should have. My friend had the fajitas, which came out sizzling and looked pretty solid. There were lots of brightly-colored peppers to go with the steak, and the guacamole was good.

All in all, this is a solid choice for Mexican food in this part of town. Just don't be in a rush when you come here."}
{"text":"My wife and I saw a review and had to try it and we were not disappointed. If you haven't been here let me tell you the menu is huge don't let that scare you. My wife and I both got a three item plate, I got two ground beef tacos and a carne asada burro and added a cheese enchilada because I couldn't make up my mind. My wife got a flauta a carne asada burro and a ground beef enchilada. The food was amazing and the service was great. It's a Friday night and it was super busy but are sever Rosa was great and very attentive to us. My 18 month old even enjoyed the food we had to take turns giving her food to keep up with her. If your looking for really good Mexican food at a great price you have to try Baja Joe's. Next time we come I am trying their sea food it looks amazing."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday, there was live music.
The chopped salsa had a nice amount of friendly heat but a bit watery. Nice combo and a la carte options. I had the mixed greens with ranch - not usually a ranch fan, but it was good. Great service all around."}
{"text":"Great food, Great service, Can't ask for more!  Don't let the area and the decor stop you! Kick back, have and amazing margarita, and enjoy a night out! This is the first place I can honestly tell you that, I don't know if there was a T.V. in the restaurant because, I was so focused on the fun, atmosphere and food!"}
{"text":"Always love coming to Baja Joe's for their food and margaritas! Everything on the menu is authentic tasting and their pina coladas are smooth and creamy (no ice chunks). Best mexican food I have ever had. Needs a bigger waiting room but that is the only bad thing I can say!"}
{"text":"I have been here gobs and gobs of times. Taco Tuesday is my day. $2.00 tacos-- I always have the breaded shrimp taco with cabbage on a flour tortilla. Never disappointed.  The place gets really busy on Tuesdays by about 5:00 so be warned. They have a nice big outdoor patio and great drink prices for happy hour too. Only negative is service can be pretty spotty at busy times. Today-- early everything is awesome and the taco is delicious as ever!"}
{"text":"my boyfriend and i went there tonight thinking that it was a nice place to eat.. oh how WRONG we were.. 
first of all, it was way too noisy and loud and we couldnt even hear each other, secondly things on their menu are way too overpriced.  i mean SERIOUSLY? it was ridiculous..
and last but not least,  THE FOOD. let me start off by saying i ordered a 1 item entree of a steak taco with spanish rice and beans.. and when they brought me out my meal, i just couldnt believe my eyes. what i got was a plain non seasoned steak meat on a plain tortilla. no cheese,lettuce or tomato or anything. and lukewarm rice and beans with cheese. and no flavor of any kind. it WAS DISGUSTING and gross. if i had wanted  plain meat on a tortilla,i would have asked for it that way.. and with the beans, it looked like someone had just dumped a spoonful on the plate with a clump of cheese and then threw the plate in the microwave. i was BEYOND disappointed, and i will  NEVER EVER set foot in that place again and would never recommend it to anyone... the food is BEYOND  HORRIBLE. and if i had it my way, i wouldnt give them any stars at all..."}
{"text":"Gotta love Carmen.  She is a great bartender.   Funny, friendly and on point service.   Other servers a little slow.   Standing around talking instead of paying attention to customers"}
{"text":"We had never heard of this place and so glad we got introduced to it! My husband and I absolutely love Mariscos and have always gone to Mariscos Sinaloa (48th Street) because we knew for sure we were guaranteed Mariscos there! Well, now that we met Baja Joe's we are completely sold! Service at both locations can be slow on a busy day or time, however, when you start comparing quality and portion size, Baja Joe's is a win! I had a shrimp cocktail (abulon, shrimp, octopus) and my fish bowl was seriously packed with seafood! Not just full of vegetables (cucumber, tomato etc.) like the other Mariscos restaurants. My husband had the Malificio (combination of oysters, scallops, drowned, shrimp  and octopus), which he too loved. We eat Mariscos quite a bit and have never experienced this and we will for sure return! They are not shy at all on their seafood portions. Thank you Baja Joe's!

PS..The salsa was extremely tasty and good, you need to try this place!"}
{"text":"Don't come to this place unless you pay cash. The food was alright, I had the campechana especial, and my son had the chicken nuggets. Before placing my order, I had asked the waitress that was attending to the table I was at, her name is Janet, to please separate my son's and my order from the everyone else's bill, she refused to separate it, why? I don't know. Once coming to paying though, I asked her to give me my bill of what I had and my son had, and she wouldn't listen to me, she was looking at the other people I was sitting with, who told her not to, and I directly told her to ignore them that I was going to pay for my food which I had consumed as well as my sons. I handed her my card, told her to swipe it for MY bill, and instead she charged me the WHOLE tables bill, which was 202.49, when she brought me the ticket for me to sign, I was baffled on how she misunderstood me. I asked her to refund me the 202.49 back to my card, and charge me what I owed, she \"refunded\" it, charged me 33.99 for what I ate. I check my bank account, and it's -112 dollars because of the 202 pending on my account. Keep in mind I went Saturday June 20th, 2015 called the restaurant that same day after I left and spoke to Javier the general manager, who told me that it would drop off by Monday morning, I believed him, on Monday it still hadn't dropped off, went to the restaurant, apparently Javier was out of town, so I had to speak to David the bar manager, who told me they would do anything in their power to fix it. And blamed my bank for holding the funds. Tuesday came by and still nothing. Now it's Wednesday June 24th, and it's STILL pending, I already went to my bank and the fault is in part of the business Baja Joe's, on my bank records, it showed that the amount of 202.49 was charged and approved, leaving me with a negative balance and a HORRIBLE experience. I am left to suffer because of Baja Joe's staff, who chose not to listen to her customer. Clearly they need to train their staff how to properly refund people, and to actually listen to their customers.
__________________________________________________________
Update to June 25th 2015
I was called by the owner, he claimed that he wanted to apologize to me for what happened, but instead I was told I had no human compassion and an irresponsible mother, I was not expecting a phone call. He did apologize, but apologies do not fix his staffs mistakes. I understand we are all human, and we are imperfect as a species, but when someone asks you to let them pay for the food they have consumed, let them pay. I would never want anyone to come here not as a personal vendetta, but to save them from a headache that lasts for days and being harassed by the owner of the company himself. Baja Joe's owner, I hope you learn from your staffs mistake, to train them properly for these situations, because as you so clearly pointed out when you called me you yourself have been in those types of situations multiple times. How could I not be angry when was the one being punished by your companys actions? Leaving me without the ability to even use my own money, because of your negligence of training your staff properly? To those of you thinking about coming to visit this restaurant, I hope you don't have the same issue as I did, pay cash if you must."}
{"text":"Good food, the peppers stuffed with shrimp and cream cheese are legit!! Very good seafood all the way around."}
{"text":"Great, authentic Mexican cuisine, generous portions, huge menu, friendly, helpful staff! Why not five stars? It is TOO good! The place is crowded, and noisy! Give it a try, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Great food, very authentic, good atmosphere, and friendly staff. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Place was a bit dirty feeling loud and the food wasn't all that tasty. I did have a really enjoyable bar tender but that would be the only reason I returned."}
{"text":"Just mived to AZ from Los Angeles this place has amazing enchiladas and civiche I also recommend the green sauce for the enchiladas."}
{"text":"I cannot comment on the food but I can comment on the service. Our friends band was playing so we went to watch him on a Friday night. Our bartender was EXTREMELY rude and my husband and I were standing at an open space at the bar. The bartender came over and took our drink order and then never came back with our drinks. She kept looking over at us but never made the drinks. We thought maybe she was jus backed up but about 15 minutes later, we realized we weren't getting our drinks. We went to another guy at the bar and he was a bit friendlier and got the drinks pretty quick. I used to be a bartender so I know how busy they are but this lady was standing behind the bar talking to what seemed to be her bar back and acting a bit stuck up. I have a pretty low tolerance for women that treat people like this so we were over her pretty quick. The atmosphere and energy is fun - music is EXTREMELY loud."}
{"text":"Baja Joes is fantastic! Walking in, I forget I'm in Mesa & am immediately taken back to Rocky Point. My parents were the first to refer me here. Driving by, it's not a spot you'd typically think \"hey, I should eat there!\" Well, good thing you're reading this. You should eat there. - For an appetizer, order the bacon wrapped-shrimp stuffed-peppers, & allow them to change your life. I always order Carnitas or Carne Asada, I haven't gotten tired of it yet, since it's awesome. My boyfriend is faithful to their Siete Mares soup, which is very good as well! If you enjoy Mexican-Mexican over Gringo-Mexican, you'll find yourself delighted here."}
{"text":"Food was good unfortunately the bartender was completely out of line and rude. We walk in to have dinner and watch the bronco chiefs game (I'm wearing a bronco jersey) and sit down at the bar to be greeted by the bartender very rudely say my team is going to lose and he is going to \"piss in my drink\". I can take friendly rivalry but this is absolutely no way to treat a customer. His demeanor and attitude was disgusting during the entirety of our meal. Needless to say we left after our meal and watched the game elsewhere."}
{"text":"4/2- update
Went for breakfast. The chorizo plate was very good. Just the right amount of spice.  Wife had breakfast burrito that was huge. The chips were fresh and salsa was flavorful. 
Bloody Mary was good and Beers were ice cold. 
Servers were very nice and attentive.  

I'm leaving my original review but have been back multiple times since then and had much more positive experiences. 


Usually love this place. Went on Sunday for dinner. The food was not up to normal standards nor was the service. The chimichangas were too crisp and burned on the bottom. The fajita burrito meat had little flavor. I think the salsa was missing something too because it just tasted like tomatoes. I think the server forgot about us as we had to ask busser for drink refills and chips.  Also had to wait an extended period for our check. Will probably go back since it is close to home but the restaurant definitely has fallen on our list."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant. For one thing, I see a lot of Hispanic folks eating there. The wait staff is friendly and helpful to a degree you don't often luck into. The michelada (it's a mexican tomato beer) is a wonderful way to take beer. We've done four or five trips to this restaurant and both my wife and I have found the food to be excellent every time. They specialize in some sea food dishes if you like Mexican sea food. You get the feeling of dining in Mexico here. Good people, good food, good ambiance. We intend to do our part to keep this place going. It is kind of hidden in the little plaza at the corner of McKellips and Gilbert."}
{"text":"Order fish and shrimp grilled for tacos!!! So good! We sat outside today and they had two men playing authentic music. Great atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"The service was definitely subpar and rude. The waitress spoke to us in Spanish knowing that we did not know it ourselves when we stared at her after she asked us questions and responded in English. She mixed our drinks and did not refill our chips and salsa because she wanted us to ask her to do it. She did not come to ask how our food was, we had to flag her down jus to get the check. She got my boyfriend's order wrong and did not attempt to fix it. He was served disgusting seafood skewers with large chunks of soggy fish and bitter tasting shrimp and tomatoes. The entire plate was soaked in butter for no reason, even his rice and side salad were wet which is very disgusting. It looked all very unappetizing considering all he asked for was shrimp skewers. After we told the waitress he was unhappy she did not even offer to remove the meal from our bill or replace it with anything else. I ended up covering the bill because I suggested the place thanks to many misleading reviews. My shrimp cocktail was decent but the shrimp was extremely salty and there was no cucumber, cilantro, tomato, onion or avocado in it. Just shrimp and juice. Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"I have had a few issues before at Baja Joe's, but I'm seeing some positive changes. It is great when the owner steps up and makes changes to improve on issues and complaints. I have been back to Baja Joe's and the new bar manager and the owner improving the service. It seems like they are moving in the right direction. I have to compliment David and the staff for my late Sunday evening visit. It was late and they were obviously cleaning and getting ready to close up. When sheepishly asked if we could still enjoy a beer at the bar, they were very friendly and welcoming us to stay. Like the positive attitude changes."}
{"text":"Baja Joes fish tacos are awesome!! Get them fried or grilled. I come at least 1 time a month if not more. Tuesday is tacos for $2 any taco you want. I suggest carnitas, fish and carne asada tacos. Waitresses are very friendly and do a great job! Weekends you get a chance to see mariachi!!"}
{"text":"I'm sad to write this review because I love their food. Tonight, we dined in and ordered drinks and food, totaling $49. We paid and tipped $7 because I waited 5 minutes each time my drink was empty because one of the bartenders wanted to flirt with her regular customers. After closing , I decided to order two Don Julio shots, and the guy I knew that worked there asked the bartender to make them... we heard her talking about how we only tipped her $7 the first time around and then he proceeded to tell us we couldn't order those shots because the bar was closing, even though she had never made an announcement saying it was last call. There were plenty of people at the bar
.. She had the worst attitude because of her tip which she didn't deserve anyways because we had to wait for our drinks in the 1st place. Sad to not return to the place. The chefs were great there."}
{"text":"\" I had a bad experience for the first time in 4 years here. Terrible customer service by the female bartender + Carlos ( bar back). Food is great but would rather order take out then sit. And get served by those two clowns..."}
{"text":"Overall food quality was good. Wasn't impressed but not turned off to coming back. Believe in the rule of 3 (most places take 3 visits) . This being my first time, I have nothing to judge this experience on. Carna Asada was dry and over cooked. Shredded beef taco and enchilada were great."}
{"text":"We've traveled all over Mexico and most of the Southwest and appreciate most
Mexican cuisine.  Our experience is that few  U.S. Mexican restaurants offer
much (or any) seafood and what is offered seldom has a freshness you find
on the Mexican coasts.  Until now.

We found Baja Joe's Cantina (Gilbert Road, Mesa)  thanks to a Groupon offer
which led us to a non-descript strip center. Two steps inside, the atmosphere is
pure Mexican neighborhood ambience with simply the best selection of seafood
we've seen in the Valley. Not only many choices, but the best preparation and fresh taste.

Ever, the manager, greets every guest and is totally enthusiastic about his
menu and his staff. He mentioned losing many regular neighborhood customers
as the economy drove them back to Mexico, but his promotions have paid off
by bringing in new customers who never would have found the restaurant
otherwise. Everyone in the restaurant when we ate there was a repeat visitor,
so that shows how great the food is. We'll be back as well.

Don't wait for a coupon. Find Baja Joe's!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic and a hidden gem in Mesa. Everything I tried was tasty. Good Mexican music and great atmosphere. I'll be back for a date night with my girl. Open around 9:am, breakfast as well as lunch or dinner of course."}
{"text":"Don't let the non-descript outside appearance scare you off. The food and service was very good. The fajita shrimp plate was nothing short of amazing. The service, spectacular. We ventured here on a friend's recommendation and will certainly be back. Be prepared, interior noise is quite loud."}
{"text":"I've been coming in here every Friday for about two years, all I can say great service, amazing authentic  Mexican cuisine, great $6.99 lunch special with $2 drafts! Check this place out Sean you are a great owner keep it up!"}
{"text":"Ordered fajitas (steak) and ceviche to go..... the fajitas where really good and well served! Came with rice /beans and pico! Although the ceviche wasn't the best I've had but also not the worst! Definitely try the steak fajitas though!"}
{"text":"Love the food here and the service has always been good as well.  The guacamole is so good, as are their margaritas.  If we lived closer we would go more often!  We have never ordered anything we did not like so I do not have any suggestions."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good...about 4 stars good.  The service is a different story...maybe 1 star and that is being generous.
We were basically ignored the whole time we were there by our server.  Took forever to get her to take our drink order and then when she did finally bring our drinks mine was wrong, had ordered a margarita with NO salt and of course it had salt.  I had ordered a side of sour cream and of course she forgot it, and once I realized this had to flag down a different server because our server had once again disappeared.  My husband asked for another when she brought our dinner out...10 minutes later no beer so asked the hostess to find our server since we had not seen her since she delivered the food.  When she did finally bring the beer blamed it on the bartender.  Never once did she come over to our table after bringing our meal out and asked us if everything was ok or if we needed anything else.  Let me add they were not busy at all so no excuse really for this horrible service.
This was our second visit to Baja Joe's, the first visit being a few months ago and had a wonderful server and a very pleasurable experience.  But after this last visit we won't be back."}
{"text":"I found a new fave today. The reviews were pretty right on. The food ROCKS! Got the Steak Picado Chimi and man it was the best I have ever had. The wait staff I am split on. I am not sure if it was because I ordered take out but the waitress that took my order seemed less than thrilled to be there and made no attempt at customer service. The second waitress that approached me asked me if I would like a glass of water while I waited and was very pleasent. In retrospect I should have gave her the tip lol"}
{"text":"Baja Joe's is a cute little Restaurant with good authentic Mexican food. Good Service. I love their menudo and my husband says they have a pretty good stuffed burger."}
{"text":"Eat lunch here all the time.  Really love this place.  Quality is always good IMO but you  don't want to go here if you are in a hurry.  If you have 45 minutes for lunch you're good but less than that and it'll ruin your lunch.  

Fish Tacos, Lunch special Burro and the Burro special only in the bar are all great choices.  I keep meaning to try those stuffed peppers wrapped in bacon though."}
{"text":"After receiving a very nasty reply from the owner regarding my last review, I now wish that I could give this dump -5 stars. As a \"professional business man\" one would think that the owner would be open to critique that could better his business. Apparently, this is not the case at Baja Joes. Not only was the food horrid, the owner is also snide and condescending, cannot say that I am surprised. The food really is a reflection of their owner. I am absolutely taken aback by the amount of unprofessional (or lack thereof) from Baja J. The purpose of my last review was NOT to promote another business or \"ride anyone's coat tails\". I was simply leaving my honest opinion about several Mexican dishes that I know a GREAT deal about! Growing up in a Hispanic household, I KNOW what good/real Mexican seafood tastes like, and regrettably, you will not find either at Baja Joes. Baja J, I apologize if my previous review was too honest for you, however, you sir, need to learn some professionalism and respect! Please understand that this was my honest review of YOUR food and what needs improvement. Again this was MY honest review of YOUR restaurant. If I wanted to promote another restaurant I would leave a review on THEIR page, not yours! I am in NO WAY affiliated with any restaurant, if I was, don't you think that I would be promoting the heck out of it? Do your research Baja J, I have not even reviewed the establishment I mentioned previously. If I were you, I would take a serious look at your menu, recipes, and attitude because judging by other reviewers I am not the only one who has had these complaints. Do you belittle and undermine everyone who does not like your restaurant? Would you prefer that I say I have received better meals from Taco Bell, or would that be promoting another business as well? Future diners beware, if you do not care for their food you will be publicly chastised for your honest opinion. The owner will not try to remedy the situation or make up for the fact that you wasted $65 on a terrible experience. Heck, he wont even apologize that you had a bad meal. Absolutely inexcusable."}
{"text":"Had the ceviche tostada, mister had the carne asada tacos. Both were ok. Queso fundio for an app. not good. Service was slow and I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Came here again with the whole family (6of us) after a first successful evening. Once again, the service was remarkable and the owner very friendly. The food we ordered was the whole red snapper, the fish tray, and the sistes martes ( I know I spelled that wrong but it was the soup of the seven seas). I have it 4 stars again because of this. 

I got the whole fish because I thought it would be basically 2x the size of the fillet. It was definitely not, and it was a little too cooked / breaded so there was hardly any meat and way too much work. The taste still was great, but I will definitely opt for the filet next time. The seafood platter was very impressive. Everything's was cooked absolutely to perfection. The only downside was that it was pretty salty on some pieces. The red fish ( I have no idea  what it was called but it was straight out red) was my favorite because it was cooked so amazingly. It's not easy to deep fry such a small piece of fish and have it come out perfectly! Because it is all fried,  I would not recommend getting just that because I personally would get sick of it, but since we all also shared the fish (tacos) and soup, the meal was very balanced. Moving on to the soup, it was pretty good. It was cool to see snails in it as they are hard to find in AZ. It was full of different seafood which my family really enjoyed, but the broth was a bit bland. I was expecting a bouillabaisse tasting broth but it was a slightly fishy chicken broth. I'm not sure we would get that again but it's definitely a mellow flavor if you like that. Overall even though the food should have served 4 people, the 6 of us were exploding and had to work hard to finish everything. And the prices (I think $60) was so totally worth it! I mean it's hard to find such fresh seafood in AZ, but Baja joes nails it and the prices are reasonable and the portions are massive. We will definitely make this one of our regulars."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical at first for trying this place because I haven't seen it advertised much (which doesn't necessarily mean it's good but...). We walked in and the atmosphere is fun as there are sea murals painted on all the walls and overall it's very clean. They played top 40-type music as well which added to the atmosphere. There is an adjoining bar, along with an outdoor patio.

The food was great too. The salsa was very good, which is how I usually judge a Mexican food restaurant. The food was delicious and presented very well. It wasn't just slapped on the plate and you can tell there is some care to it. I ordered a chicken tostada plate and it was very flavorful. The chicken is marinated and was awesome. The plate comes with salad as well, in addition to the normal rice and beans. My son ordered a chicken quesadilla and it was great. It had a ton of meat. My husband ordered the enchilada plate and it was tasty.

The pricing is VERY reasonable. 

The service is awesome too! Our waitress stopped by our table at least 4 times during the course of our meal. Our food arrived quickly and we never lacked drinks. You can tell they really care about service.

We will be back! Glad I tried this place."}
{"text":"Tacos were awesome. Had carnitas, chicken and steak and all were delicious. The margaritas were even better and priced exceptionally well during their happy hour."}
{"text":"I want to really love this place the food has potential. The problem was we went Friday night and it's really a bar a place for a good time to have drinks if you can't make it to cabo this weekend. I had a long week and wanted to spend quality time with the fiancé. It was so noisy she got a head ache and we had really slow service. No refills. No checking back to see if the food was okay. I uploaded a picture and they have a five dollar off Yelp promotion but it was not worth the time it took to get the bill adjusted. I'm going with we got unlucky with a new waitress because usually I can tell if the Diet Coke is good they are at the very least servicing the soda machine that is generally a good sign. I'll have to give them another chance for lunch I see lunch specials that look really good. This was just a really painful experience from the moment we got the guac made at our table until the end. It started off good but maybe the time it took for the waitress to make the guac at the table set a chain of events in motion that caused us to have to sit there for over an hour in an extremely noisy bar with lots of drunk people having a good time."}
{"text":"First time I tried this place I ordered a large ceviche, although the ceviche tasted great I felt I over payed for the amount that I got and I was extremely disappointed. I could have gone to my regular place for a better deal."}
{"text":"Been there for lunch quite a few times and is good for lunch. Never tried there more expensive seafood fare but it looks good. 

Great stand by"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my wife and friends from out of town. It seemed like it's more of a bar than a restaurant, at least in the evening. The food was good though. Beer was cold. So five stars for being a bar and grill , and having good food and cold beer."}
{"text":"I got the nachos and for $10 I expected real cheese but was sadly disappointed to have gotten nacho cheese. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Pretty yummy Mexican food,  I live nearby here and I never bothered to go here until my friend suggested it.  Their burritos are amazing!"}
{"text":"We were driving around trying to find an outdoor dining  place big enough, just in case the kids wanted to walk around. Being in East Mesa, places are soooo limited. Stumbled upon this restaurant after driving around, and lets face it, Mexican food is pretty damn tasty. 

Got here and it is nice, clean and bright. No one's at the front, but we don't wait more then a minute for a hostess to greet us and seat us outside--which is where wanted to be at 78 degrees in AZ. 

The waitress comes and greets us quickly and asks for drink orders. We get my sons order, by we wait 10 min about for our beer and margarita orders. A little long but she did apologize for the wait and was genuine about it. He margaritas were a good deal! They were $8 for about 14oz. I think it was well worth it!

Put in our food orders and they came out rather quickly as well. Both me and my fiancé got shrimp and my son had chicken fingers. The chicken fingers weren't that hot which was a plus. My fried shrimp was yummy and the fiancés shrimp quesadilla was definitely enjoyable. I liked that for my side salad they used a greener lettuce and not just general iceberg.

Had to order desert, which was a homemade flan and it was was creamy and delicious! 

For Mesa, a good restaurant on enjoy:)"}
{"text":"This place get one star because the service is and has always been bad. We waited 15 min before someone came to us and helped us. Keep in mind the place wasn't busy at all. Yet the waitress just talking with one another. The food is good for the location where it's at. This wasn't the first time I've waited that long it's been 3 times. I'm not spend my money here anymore. 3 opportunities is more then what i should of gave."}
{"text":"The food was OK but the noise of the restaurant was unbearable. We left very frustrated as we could not talk to anyone in our party."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times now and I love the place! We walked in there you feel like you're in a restaurant in Rocky point Mexico. It's got a really cool coastal beach theme. The menu is rather large and has a lot of options. It is a bit cumbersome to understand in parts of the language barrier. Service on both times that we went was exceptional. They have a ceviche tostada on happy hour that is knock your socks off fantastic. That with a cold Corona light draft beer you can't go wrong. My only negative issue was there's a male manager that walks around the dining room on both occasions with a cold and stern look on his face and seems really uninviting. He stopped at our table to clear off some table settings and didn't even speak to us which I thought was disconcerting. I find the parking lot a bit sketchy to as the first time we were there there were people walking out of the restaurant with Bud lights in her hand heading towards her vehicles and the second time there was a couple of good old boys in the parking lot with the tailgates of their trucks down sipping on a bottle of Jack Daniels. Does it give the place very good curb appeal. Other than that this place is rockstar!"}
{"text":"Great food, service and lively atmosphere. Very friendly and attentive staff. The seafood selection is diverse and priced right. They  have a bar with TVs if that's your thing and an open Dining room. Try the shrimp stuffed bacon wrapped jalapeños or the ceviche tostadas!"}
{"text":"Ordered food at bar got wrong food and bartender told me..Hey its good I like that just try it. Drink was made wrong. Happened twice with same bartender."}
{"text":"Only been here twice.  The service kinda sucks.  Normally don't give bad reviews. But my last experience was terrible. The first time the service took a while even though it was not busy at all.  The food was okay. Just as any other typical cantina fish fry. The second experience was worse.   Came in with my best friend for some food and drink.  We got his drink and we looked at the menu.   Decided what we wanted and sat at the bar for 15 to 20 minuets.  Waitress was just talking to other customers which is fine.  Refilling their drinks and stuff.  Passed by us multiple times. Something was wrong with the bar sink behind the counter and the manager was there watching another employee fix it.  After it was fix the manager was just standing there watching people come in and out the door. Not once did he ask would you like to order.  Finally he did.  \"Are you guys going to order?\"   Really?  We only have menus here just to look.  \"Not anymore,  can we just pay for the drink\"  we just paid for the drink and left.  What kinda customer service is that?  They wernt't even busy.  I don't expect a lot but that experience wasn't good at all."}
{"text":"The owner is very friendly and engaged, and the food is very good.  I ate while my kids skateboarded at Kids that Rip next door, so very convenient if you want to stay close.  I ordered a carne asada taco (it rocked), shredded beef taco and bean tostada (ok, not spectacular).  Margaritas are good.  Ambiance is bright, simple, and somewhat authentic - meaning I could see this place being in a border town, complete with mariachi tunes on the stereo.  I'll come back."}
{"text":"I have always been impressed with the food quality and the attentive service at this Baja Joe's. The food is authentic and the portions are generous. Management makes extra effort to make sure everything is great."}
{"text":"Came with my hyper 6 year old after an evening of fun. The restaurant portion was full but there was immediate seating in the high tops by the bar (which works perfect because she can get up or watch tv without bothering anyone). Our server Shannon was obviously busy and quick to take orders, but as soon as the crowd cleared out she was very attentive and fun! Our food took a little to come out (nothing excessive.. maybe 20 mins?) so we were offered free dessert. Fried ice cream is my daughters favorite so she chose that and told Shannon it's almost her birthday (almost 2 weeks away).. Shannon came out with the birthday portion and sang her happy birthday with a lit tortilla chip. The food was delicious and very large portion. She and I shared the carne asada and still have tons left over. Bill was only $23 for carne aside, a margarita, a soda and our free fried ice cream. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I had heard a few good reviews of this place so my husband and I stopped in for dinner one night. The atmosphere is a little loud and the staff seemed pretty busy. We ordered a beef chimi and a fajita burrito deluxe. They were both ok, nothing to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"We had a horrible experience at this place. The food was mediocre and the service was horrible!!!! Clara was our server...we had to ask her 4 times for water. It was over an hour before she finally broght one cup of water but we asked her for 3. Our friend's food never came out, so she finally cancelled her order and didnt eat! Our waitress never once checked on us to see if we needed anything, and when she delivered items she only appeared tondeliver one item at a time. Then she added automatic gratuity, which is just unethical as she knew she did not earn a tip!!!! We will never go back!"}
{"text":"I loooove Baja Joes!! Such a great place to go for margs, chips and salsa any time of the day and be greated by freindly staff. When we go, we sit at the bar. Sometimes just drinks, chips and salsa other times we get tacos. They have amazing fish tacos....seriously. The fried one is the best. I still get a grilled shrimp taco, but my boyfriends fish taco is always better. Reason said is well, it just has great flavor and the bottle of taco chipotle sauce is super good. I just like shrimp tacos though....

Reason that even though I love this place they only get 3 stars is because my shrimps taco is inconsistent in both price and flavor and size...sometimes there is like 8-10 shrimps, the last time there was four, it was pathetic for a five dollar taco that ended up being even more because for some reason the waitress charged me an extra $1.75 on top of the five bucks for \"grilled\" I didnt eorder any fixings on it except cabbage, nothing else and the menu clearly states grilled or fried, same price. So for $6.75 I got an extremely dissapointing excuse of a cook that didn't give a crap, a waitress who overcharged and an empty stomach. Step it up Baja Joes!! We come here alot, I want to continue that trend. But there are plenty of fish tacos in this sea... If you check in on Yelp you get five bucks off."}
{"text":"This placed USED to be great, BUT they switched to Pepsi, yuck! More than half the reason I came here was for Coke. The food just doesn't taste good anymore without coke. Won't be coming back. Too many other good Mexican restaurants that serve coke that I'll be supporting."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing.  Food, service, price, we will for sure be back.   The staff was busy because the place was packed but the service was exceptional.  Very friendly and checked on us multiple times.  They don't have tamales but the chili rellenos are dynamite.   Chips fresh, salsa fresh.  It was all so yummy."}
{"text":"The food was awesome & so was the service!!!! It was my 1st time going & my husband & I were very impressed!!! We will be coming back! It was a Great Date Night!!!"}
{"text":"This is a Mesa gem. Carmen, the bartender was the best. Family atmosphere is nice and service never disappoints.  Best way to down your Sunday."}
{"text":"This place is so so good!!! Clean (for a change) mariscos place. Very nice wait staff and delicious food. also, the micheladas are excellent!"}
{"text":"Prices have gone UP!! Daily and after 8pm specials aren't as good now. The IPA they have on tap is not included in the after 8 special?! :( 

The javi-hot wings are tasty. The \"stuffed\" burger is just two patties."}
{"text":"The service was excellent, as was the guacamole! I had the shrimp quesadilla which was so good and my husband had the shrimp enchilada's which he really liked a lot. Our compliments went to the chef. The atmosphere was a bar atmosphere. I had a virgin margarita which was just ok and my spouse had 2 regular margaritas which he felt were weak and had a soapy taste...but he had 2 so I guess they weren't that bad. Bottom line - food & service were excellent, atmosphere and drinks just so so. We did use the $5 coupon with absolutely no problem. Dinner was $48 + tip. I would absolutely return!"}
{"text":"I had the seafood enchiladas. The food was pretty good, and the margarita was potent. The crowd on a Saturday night was hilarious. There was live music and plenty of people dancing without a care. I was not mad at that at all!"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night for first time at the restaurant. The service was absolutely terrible. We sat down and waited for 10 minutes until a waitress came and took our drink order. Every table had chips and sausa, we had to ask for them. We had to ask for the spice tray, which every table had one, and when our entre's came, I had to send mine back as it wasn't what the menu said it was. At every other table, the patrons had water, we were given any or asked if we wanted any. Very disappointing.  I will not return or recommend the restaurant to our friends."}
{"text":"Love this place! Ceviche, fish, shrimp, lobster, it doesn't matter  love it. Its a fun place to eat especially when they bring out the big old flaming clay fish with a ton of seafood on top."}
{"text":"Service is ok the original is better.  Hate the music mis the original mexican music.  This is not ligit."}
{"text":"Tried this after reading the four star reviews. Our experience didn't match up. Came with my wife and kids. None of us were impressed. Enchiladas were bland. The ranchera sauce was way different than other places I've had ranchera and I disliked it. My wife strongly disliked the chili relleno. Strongly disliked the queso - evidently it's a style that seems to use a heavy base of flour, creme, and mild cheese I'm guessing? Not in my preferred taste. Anyway, cool murals on the wall and fun atmosphere but I found the flavors and food textures pretty bland."}
{"text":"Mixed reviews from our group.  My carnitas was very salty yet my husband's steak burrito was delicious.  Our party of 6 was charged an automatic gratuity.  Not a big deal but we did not know in advance about this.  Our waitress had a hard time keeping the orders straight and had to re-do a few things but it all worked out.  Chips and salsa were great."}
{"text":"Service is mediocre. Food is pretty good!!! Stick with the seafood!! Got the cevichi tostada, it was yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot. Excellent grilled chicken salad! Baha burrito was delicious. Kids chicken tenders and fries were a big hit, too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Baja Joes and I'm afraid I was unimpressed.

We ordered Shrimp cocktail, Garlic shrimp and Ceviche. - three staple Mexican dishes.

The cocktail was watery and has frozen shrimp

The garlic shrimp was swimming in oil, the four slices of potato were undercooked and the rice was burnt - also the shrimp was still in its shell whilst swimming in oil which made it virtually impossible to de-shell.

The ceviche was average at best.

The house lemonade was lovely and the service was pretty good but the meal was not worth $50

I'm afraid I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great mexican flavors. We often come for lunch and have never been dissapointed. The deep fryed icecream is a meal in itself!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely not what I expected. The food was really good but not THE BEST food. The salsa was good and slightly spicy. The fish wasn't seasoned all that great, and not crispy. Beans were real good. Service was nice, friendly and attentive. The price was reasonable. Happy hour seems real nice, and the Sunday football specials sound real good. The decor was fun and colorful."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Gross food. Everyone we saw was eating shrimp cocktail or ceviche. Because the Mexican food is horrible. The enchilada sauce tasted like chili sauce. And the chicken was disgusting.  Don't go there."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years and have never had a bad meal. I think it would be more well known except it's kind Zofran hidden in a corner. Nice people good food. What else is there?"}
{"text":"Baja Joe's is definitely a MUST try before you die! Not only is the service impeccable, the food is extremely delicious! First we started with some chips, salsa and guacamole (which they made fresh at the table). The chips were warm and crispy and the salsa was top notch. My bf got the combo platter choosing the shrimp taco and carne asade enchilada as his two items. The shrimp was cooked to perfection and the beans and rice that came with it were awesome too! But lets get down to the important matter, what I got. A friend had recommended the whole fish so I ordered the whole garlic red snapper. I was more than impressed! It was crispy and extremely flavorful, could have probably fed 2-3 people so I had a lot for leftovers. The meat of the fish tasted really fresh, came right off and I didn't get any bones. They provided tortillas and I was able to make a super delicious fish taco that included the crispy garlic fish, rice (that came with the fish) and their special chipotle sauce and spicy salsa ( provided on the table). Baja Joe's is my favorite Mexican Cantina by far, and that is counting all the ones have been too (even in California). My friend got the crazy seafood platter that had everything on a boat with a flame underneath and he enjoyed it very much. They also have margaritas served by the pitcher for $19 and it was worth it. I STRONGLY recommend giving this hidden gem a try!! Scouts honor this place is AWESOME!"}
{"text":"At first, I almost walked out because the chips tasted horrible! We brought it to the waitresses attention and she promptly replaced them with fresh chips that were fantastic! The salsa is chunky with a little heat which I like and they also have a great extra hot salsa that has very good flavor even though It was quite spicy. 

I had a chicken fajita chimichanga that had great flavor and really hit the spot. We also had a beef burrito that was very delicious. I can see why this is a favorite for the locals and I'm glad we found it!"}
{"text":"Alright, I'm gonna preface this in the interest of fairness with that we generally really like Baja Joe's. My fiancé used to come in here pretty often with co-workers, and we go for Taco Tuesday frequently. The menu is huge and almost everything has been really good. I am obsessed with the fish tacos and the chipotle sauce. 

The thing I am steamed about is how we were treated last night. 
We came in to have dinner and some drinks. Bartender asks what we want to drink. I noticed the big chalkboard sign on the wall, said \"Oh look, $3 margaritas\" and ordered one.

She brought it in a huge glass but we thought nothing of it, because that is what you will get for $4 Happy Hour at most Mexican joints. 

The bill comes & it's $8. My fiancé flags a different bartender down & inquires. She says \"Oh yeah that's a mistake, sorry... The blonde girl? Yeah it's her first night, I'll go get her\". 

Blonde bartender comes around the corner and I would never have guessed it was her first night, by the way she lectured us about it. \"That was a BIG one, that was 18 oz. It's only for the smalls. We have a small and a large.\"  We tell her we didn't ask for a big one, the sign didn't specify anything besides \"Margs\". She cops a fake sickly sweet tone and goes to fetch the bar manager. 

Bar manager comes around the corner and before we can say a word, pops off with her own defensive tone. \"The best I can do is bring it down to $6, because that was a big one\". 

That was the tipping point for me. We eat here enough that the waitresses recognize us. When fiance's coworkers want to go out after work, that's where they bring their business. This bar manager has met him enough times that her business card has been on our fridge for a couple years. We aren't asking for special treatment, and $5 is not a huge deal, but it felt like we were being baited and switched (honestly, it sounds similar to what some other reviewers mention). Then, especially being regular customers, for both a brand new bartender and the manager to speak to us like that really, really rubbed me the wrong way. 

She eventually did take it back to $3, after I left in a huff & my level-headed partner reasoned with her. Damage done though. The entire time we were treated like morons, and we should not have had to go through 3 people and 4 conversations to get such a minor thing taken care of. It will be a long time before we go back if this is the new standard of customer treatment."}
{"text":"This review is based only on the bar and only on service, or lack thereof! 
I came in mid week, about 5 pm. The restaurant was moderately busy but I decided to sit at the bar. That's where I made my mistake. I found a spot and sat. And sat and sat (you get the idea). There were several people behind the bar acting very busy. Apparently too busy to greet the recently seated newcomer. People on either side of me received drink and food orders but the servers never stayed long enough for me to get their attention. 
Needless to say, I won't be going back to try the food."}
{"text":"I ate dinner here with my elderly parents.  We were a little hesitant at the front door because the place looks more like a bar than a restaurant from the outside but were pleasantly surprised once inside.  The place was packed even for a Friday night, probably because the food and service are excellent for the price.  Baja Joe's specialty is fish and shrimp, but they also have a full page of their menu devoted to standard Cali-Mex things if people want that instead.  We shared an order of jalapenos stuffed with shrimp and wrapped in bacon, then we ordered a two-item combo, shrimp taco salad and fish and chips special as entrees.  Everything from the steak in my taco to the rice and salsa were nicely prepared and tasty.  The salad lettuce was fresh and crispy, and portions were pretty generous.  Service staff were all friendly, attentive and patient, which is remarkable in light of how busy the place was."}
{"text":"Came to have dinner with the family, everything was delicious. The ceviche was perfect. We finished our wonderful meal w some great flan. Service was great even though it was extremely busy. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Sadly this place has gone downhill in the past year but prices have gone up! They now charge $7.99 for lunch specials and no longer provide free chips and salsa. The chips and salsa now cost additional $1.99.  I realize that costs have gone up as a result of the minimum wage increase, but the quality has gone downhill. The chips are often stale, and the food does not taste as fresh and is often over salted.  I loved this place in 2016, I do not think I will be a regular now."}
{"text":"Very large menu. I had a steak fajita burrito while the wife had fish and chips. Chips and salsa were good, although I would have appreciated the chips being warmed. Very reasonable prices. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"It's so sad we used to love coming here as a family but the prices keep going up. Now they charge for each round of chips and salsa. Sadly not sure if this will be our go to spot anymore."}
{"text":"Tried them out on a Saturday night.  Great food and plenty of it.  My wife had the shrimp something and the shrimp was great.  Great service and fresh chips and salsa.  A little more expensive than your Mexican fast food, but well worth it."}
{"text":"First, the food was 'homemade' good................

The service, not so much.

Wednesday night, 7PM. Several parties in the waiting area. Bartender and another person saw us and Ignored us. I finally went and asked, and they said a server would be right there. Server comes and tells all of us, seat yourself where ever you want. 

Ordered margarita's and took the waitresses advice. We took our time with the menu as there a lot of choices, and not the normal fare. 

Finally ordered, still no drinks, and then waitress suggests an appetizer to try next time we are there as I told her it was our first time. So we ordered the appetizer, yellow peppers, wrapped in bacon and stuffed with Shrimp!! GOOD!!!!

Margarita's finally came as the bartender had to deliver (apologized for the delay), as the waitress was under age. 

The apps come, no silverware. We had  stopped a bus boy to get water and napkins. Of course we had JUST gotten our drinks.

Then 20-25 minutes later the main course. Again good, but I ordered a burro and got a chimi version which I did not want, but did not want to wait anymore and did not take them up on the offer to redo it..

Again, food was great!! 

Bill comes and not only did they STILL charge for the Chimi instead of the burro I ordered, but we realize they brought us one LARGE Marg, which we did not ask for. So apparently you HAVE to specific to get a normal size.

SO although we enjoyed the unusual and tasty fare (We saw Guacamole made table side and their Chipolte sauce is made there too.) 90 minutes and two mistakes later it just was NOT worth it. At the VERY least she should have NOT charged for the Chimi that was more expensive than what I ordered."}
{"text":"I guess this diamond in the rough has now been discovered.  There were no tables available inside at lunch.  The patio does have shade and a misting system but I prefer to stay inside when it is hot out so we had a little wait. I ordered the lunch special for $8.99.  It was steak and shrimp fajita's and was fantastic!  My husband ordered off the menu and had the grilled steak and it was also fabulous.  I preferred mine because it came with the typical veggie's, guacamole, (YUM) pico de gallo, rice, beans and tortillas.  My pet peeve about ordering fajita's out is that most places don't give you enough tortillas and you can never find a staff person to bring you more.  Not only that, but if I have left overs to take home I need tortillas.  DUH!!  Not here, they provided the exact amount of tortillas needed and plenty for my leftovers.  They served a full serving even at a reduced price and I really appreciated it.  They are even offering a yelp deal that I just noticed if you want to give it a try.  The seafood and steaks are what to order here. Service is amazing!  Just saying......................."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's kinda like a half sports bar half Mexican restaurant.

The meat has so much more flavor than other places, It tasted like they grill the meat using charcoal. 

I usually get the fajitas or the paqueta de asada ( I hope I spelled that right).

They always have good happy hour and daily specials and not to mention hot chicks working behind the bar.
It's definitely my type of place. 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This was totally unexpectedly delicious!! I ordered the fajitas and now I crave them all the time!! Anytime my husband or I get fajitas anywhere else, we compare them to Baja Joe's. So far none of them have lived up to them! My mom and husband didn't love their meals, but they both loved my fajitas. The atmosphere is definitely casual and has some interesting wall murals. I would've eaten outside, but there was smoking allowed on the patio."}
{"text":"The fish tacos are awesome! Great size and on Tuesdays the prices cant be beat. Shared a plate of 12 wings with a coworker and had 2 fish tacos myself and the bill was less then $10. Get the fish tacos with breaded finish on either the flour or corn tortillas, both are good."}
{"text":"They made me a veggie burrito that was outstanding. Service at the bar was great and the bartender is fantastic. I will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"The food here is really good!  I had the ceviche tostadas and rice and beans and I ate every bite!  The chips are home made and yummy. Overall I want to try a million things on the menu. Big menu too lots of Baja style seafood!  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the service was slow and lacking. We stood at the door for 5 min and no one told us to seat ourselves even though staff walked past us several times without saying anything. Our waitress took forever. We were there nearly 2 hrs for lunch. Then had to wait 15 min for the waitress to bring our check after we already told her we were done. The prices are good. And their lunch combos are only $5.99"}
{"text":"We've been here for lunch three times now and have NEVER been disappointed.  To start, the decor is super.  It makes you feel like you are in a little cantina along the Mexican coast.  The menu is extensive with a wide variety of choices and very good prices.  The wait staff is great and very attentive.  The food is so amazing.   We've gone to a  lot of different Mexican restaurants and this is probably the best and most authentic.  You will not be disappointed with anything you order.  The combo plates are super deals and come with whatever you choose (taco, enchilada, etc.), beans, rice, salad and a really refreshing orange slice.  We absolutely LOVE this place and will come back often."}
{"text":"Sean the owner is absolutely awesome. Come try this place out. Give him your honest feed back (good or bad) and he takes it to heart. I love the carne asada! The guacamole they make at your table is also very good! We went last night on a very busy night (mother's day in Mexico, which we didn't know) but for how busy it was we got served pretty quickly. Our waitress was super sweet even with all the chaos of the crowd. Thanks Sean for caring about your customers!! :O)"}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Food comes very quickly and so the drinks! Love the live band and the employed are always smiling and delightful! Fun, Fun!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I've eaten here, my food has come out cold. Doesn't matter what meal- breakfast, lunch, dinner- I have yet to be impressed. Good if you're looking for a quick fix."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were a 2. Runniest salsa I have ever had. Soupy. My shrimp enchiladas were ok. This is a bar restaurant where the mexican food is barely average. Service was good."}
{"text":"We were staying the weekend in AZ and we got in a little late on Friday. There was a large group of us that were starving after the long drive from Las Vegas. There weren't a lot of restaurants open late but I found this place on Yelp. 

Everyone at the table loved their food. The restaurant was busy but the service did a pretty good job, their were some minor mistakes but nothing that wasn't easily fixed. I also want to add that they have really delicious Micheladas!!! If I'm ever back in Mesa I would definitely come back her to eat again."}
{"text":"Ok, so for the most part of the almost 26 years I have lived here in Mesa I never knew there was a Mexican Restaurant at this location. Now I know this is a new owner as of this past January and was under a different name, but come on. I used to go to the Chinese Restaurant right off of Gilbert in the same shopping plaza, this place is kinda hidden, but wow I think you will all like this place. 
Once you walk in, it is a bright and colorful decoration, bar to the left and main restaurant ahead and when it cools down a patio out to the right outside the restaurant. Very nicely decorated patio, I must say, I can't wait till it cools down. 
On to the food.... I got the tacos and my girlfriend got the chimichanga and that came with fresh salad and fresh meat and vegetables in the chimi. The tacos were just as good. The manager of the place, Everett was probably one of the nicest guys, not fake either, which is a change for the restaurant industry. Cause you know how that goes, How is your meal, folks. Like you really give a crap, just shut up and let me eat in peace. This guy really cared and wanted to help grow this business. He also introduced us to the Michelada con Cervesa, A fancy way of saying adding your beer to Clamato Juice, lime juice, hot sauce, soy sauce and pepper and other seasonings, WHICH was awesome!!! Never would of tried it, Thanks Everett!!! 
Good Luck with the place, We will definitely tell everyone we know and recommend this to all. Please drive pass Serrano's and Tia Rosa's and check this place out. 
Great flavor, Fresh food and not watery and running all together on your plate, like the normal places."}
{"text":"Nestled inside a Mesa strip mall never did I believe that they would sell amazing mexican/mariscos type food. I am happy they proved me wrong. My friends and family come here a few times a month. Their shrimp platters have been big winners with our family. We have always ordered the ceviche tostadas, bacon wrapped shrimp, Shrimp el Diablo, and Shrimp Empanizados. The tortillas they serve on the side are also buttery and yummy. Everyone who has served us has been very professional and go above and beyond for us to have the best dining experience.
I highly recommend Baja Joes to anyone looking for fresh Mexican or Seafood!"}
{"text":"This place rules. Cold beer good nachos great prices. The chips and salsa is the best and you can get it to go for like $3. BUCKS"}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday, I had a party of 5 so they told us the wait was 10-15 min. so ok we waited. A party of 4 came 5 min after us and they were seated right away. Then a party of 9,6 and finally 4 again. By this point 30 min had already passed and no one had come to us to tell us that our table would be ready shortly. After another party of 6 showed up and were seated right away I had it! I spoke to the host and the only think she could say to me was that the booth was for 4 people and they could not seat 5. The party of 6 and 9 were seated on one of the big tables because, I think, if you have a party of 6 or more the tip is automatically included on the check. I was kind of rude with the host because she just said you have to wait more. I asked to speak to the manager and he really didn't seem to care. However, he did seat us in a table that was reserved for a party of 9 at 3 pm, it was already 3:40!!! 5 minutes after we were seated a waitress said that we needed to move because I guess the party that had reserved the table had arrived 45 minutes after their reservation. But no we said the manager seated us here and we are not moving! Horrible experience!!! After we order we could see the waitresses talking to each other and looking at our table, I was worried that they had put something in our food!!! I felt super uncomfortable after that and just left! I will not be going back. Hope they work on their customer service for future clients!"}
{"text":"I used to have to drive down to Guadalupe (the city not the street... well, actually, in Guadalupe, on Guadalupe, actually) for Mariscos like this, now I drive a mile or two down the street. Awesome! The wait staff is great... friendly, prompt, accommodating. I really enjoy their food and have had 3 different shrimp dishes and sampled 3 or more of the fish dishes. They are all delicious and the rice and potatoes they serve with the meals is a real treat also. 

I especially like the fact that they are knowledgeable about their ingredients and can tweak a lot of the recipes to make their dairy-free. They will use oil instead of butter on request making this an easy spot for people who don't eat dairy."}
{"text":"I waited with 2 other customers for almost 10 minutes at the door. No hosts. Got the fish & chips for lunch. First, no tartar sauce. The ranch & chipotle sauce are both very runny. The food was hot, but under-seasoned. And the music was very loud. In addition, the managers were standing right next to my table talking very loudly while putting up a sign on their miniscule salad bar. I dont have a reason to drive here again. It's ok at best."}
{"text":"Went to Baja Joes for lunch.  I ordered the two fish tacos lunch special.  It was okay.  It is worth noting that there is no host at the door, and there were many people waiting to be acknowledged including me.  They need to be more attentive.  

If you want Mexican style seafood go elsewhere.  Thanks.

The following is update to my review.  It is correspondence from whom I believe to be the owner of this business.  Apparently the owner has chosen to harass those who write negative reviews.  I do not normally post nasty responses that I receive, but I think it is noteworthy.  My advice to the person below is to please refrain from these kinds of attacks and work on improving your business.  Also, please cease and desist in your harassment of me.  I will reciprocate in-kind and cease and desist.  The exact message with the contents has been reported to Yelp HQ.  Please refer to below for what the message stated.  I will leave it at that.

From Sean S

funny how you went to both our restaurant AND our old owners on the same day and get us a horrible review and them a glowing one.  not suspicious in the least"}
{"text":"We love this place. Amazing fajitas. Great atmosphere. Really good chips. The shrimp fajitas serve more shrimp than I could eat."}
{"text":"This place is great! I can enthusiastically recommend everything we ordered: the table-side guacamole, the fish chimichanga, and the bacon-wrapped crab-stuffed shrimp. BACON-WRAPPED? CRAB-STUFFED? Yes. Seriously. Good quality seafood, flavorful and unique dishes, awesome service, nice clean atmosphere, aquatic murals. I'm glad we gave this place a try."}
{"text":"Came here for father's day and while it was busy and we had to wait, completely worth it. A great Mexican restaurant in this town isn't too hard to come by, but a stellar one like this place is. Thanks for the great food"}
{"text":"Came here based on other Yelp reviews. It was very good. Best in the area that we have discovered.
Eat here. You'll like it!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great and the people are fun. I've never had a bedtime here. The bartenders are super friendly and take care you."}
{"text":"I have been going here for almost 2 years. The last two times I have gone I have said I will never come back. I kept hoping that the next time would be better. Today will be the last time I will ever go here. It has gone down hill fast in the last two years. Service was terrible and there were 3 people at the hostess station standing around doing nothing but sitting on their phones. Save your money do not go here."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for Baja Joe's after checking out the great ratings on Yelp!  Easy to visit when I go to the East Valley to visit my hateful mother,  my partner and I visited on a Friday night. The place was happy, relaxed and busy.

The food was above average in every way. Great chips (really) and a salsa that had a little kick. Just a little. For an appetizer we ordered the Supreme Nacho and we were blown away. The chips were smothered in a cheese sauce that tasted more like a cheddar fondue. We totally scoffed down the tasty flavored shredded beef, beans, sour cream and guacamole. Best. Nachos. Ever.

My Stuffed shrimp w/crab and wrapped in bacon, was good but  a little dry. The sides of were wonderful rice and potatoes reminded me of spanish restaurants in New Jersey where I am from. Next time I will try their traditional food like shredded beef enchiladas . My partner ordered three tacos- on fish and two carne asada and he was very happy except no baja sauce for his fish taco. His refried beans were creamy and delicious with the mexican rice.

Baja Joe's is a great value and it really is a nice atmosphere like a neighborhood hangout. 

Still dreaming of those nachos, and will bring my hateful mother there for her birthday next month."}
{"text":"Man this place is going downhill... Bartender was pretty good, other young bartender was too busy flirting and flexing and paying undivided attention to the old drink regular that was super inappropriate to everyone who walked it. I went outside for a minute and left my sister in law in the cantina and that drink side decided he wanted to be inappropriate to her. As soon as I walked back in he went back to his corner of the bar. I found out they got rid of the jukebox which sucked since they were playing 90's. I asked if they could play some country which they did but they had to argue and explain to the drunk regular why. He had the balls to talk crap from across the bar and instead of just calming him, they told him I asked for the country music and how they would only do a couple songs then change it back... Yes your right... Please the drunk inappropriate regular, and screw anyone else... The toritos were pretty good they were a tad salty. The cantina burrito however tasted like dog food. I don't think I'll be heading back there."}
{"text":"Had a family get together here, Saturday night. Sat on patio.
Service was great, friendly and efficient.
As usual, we all loved the food and drink. Had 2 of the Platillado de Mariscos, shared by all along with some apps.
The bacon wrapped shrimp, always a favorite. 
Manager checked with us, to make sure everything ok.
Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Worst food I ever tasted. Only bottled hot sauces, no fresh salsa. Skirt steak was horrible , no flavor very bland. Very disappointed:( wouldn't never here again!!!"}
{"text":"Great home style Mexican food. Nice seafood dishes and good service. I love the relaxed vibe."}
{"text":"Food and service are great, bartenders are very attentive,  becoming a regular here, very comfortable."}
{"text":"I am so glad we decided to try Baja Joe's. The food was very good, our waitress was super nice and attentive, and the prices were pretty good. Try it, you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing meal a week ago at Baja Joe's. we returned this week for tacos and everything was just as good. Service great and food amazing."}
{"text":"Yes, this is as good as it gets.
I take the family on Sundays after church and the food has always been outstanding.  We lapsed for awhile but revisited on 10/17/2010 to find new signage (and later we find new ownership).  But the new owners very very wisely kept the menu!
The Toritos de Camaron are reason enough to go.  But everything else we've ever had is really really good too.  I go to Mazatlan 1-2 times a year and it's just like going back.  
This is not chain-Mexican or Tex-Mex...it's the real thing.  Do yourself a favor and try it out!"}
{"text":"I didn't order any seafood here (which is easily the majority of the menu) so admittedly my view on this place may be somewhat less than informed.

That being said what I did have (red beef burrito, rice beans) was meh.  Not especially bad, not especially good.

I did really like the salsa."}
{"text":"Love the food.  Yes it's in a bar but their food is actually really good. This is not a Mexican restaurant where I order a meat taco and enchiladas.  This is a place where you get their specialties such as the carne asadá plate (special marinade and grilled) of you order their seafood dishes. Excellent seafood soups too such as soup of the 7 seas...  Drinks are good but service is slow. It's still worth the wait if you aren't in the fast food style mood. The table side guacamole is a must..."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding tonight.  We actually had two gals serving us.  They were helpful with the menu because this was our first (but not last) visit.  Attentive to every need.  Never an empty glass  or dirty dish left on the table.  Shared a chicken and steak fajita with my husband.  OMG, seriously the best fajita I have had in years.  Didn't care for the red onions, I like sweet onions, but other than that, loved every bite.  Did I mention the rice?   Usually the Mexican rice is pretty tasteless, it was moist and very flavorful.  Will definitely be back!!!!"}
