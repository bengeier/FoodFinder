{"text":"This place is inside Safeway. It's reasonably priced and is pretty good. I have tried a lot of their combs they put together and I've always been happy with them. A lot of times when you buy sushi that has been prepared the rice is hard or the fish is mushy. Not this place, it always tastes fresh and delicious. The people preparing it are very nice and if you don't see something you want or want to create your own combo of things they'll make it up fresh for you."}
{"text":"Not bad at all for a sushi cash & carry at my nearby Safeway.  If you need a sushi fix, don't feel like cooking dinner, or just don't have time to go and sit down at a real sushi bar, this one will fill the bill!"}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi and fresh. We have enjoyed the convenience of having closely located to our home. Please check it out."}
{"text":"I cannot write this review based on the grocery store as a whole because truth be told, my family & I do not regularly shop at Safeway.  I will, however, write this review based upon the only reason why I go to Safeway and that is due to their sushi.  In other words, I cannot comment on the length of their lines, their lack of cashiers or store cleanliness.  I'm not stating those things are not of any importance, but for the sake of my review - that's simply not part of what I intend to base my liking on.

I go to Safeway once a week for their sushi.  The best in Arizona?  ...not by a long shot, but if we're talking about grocery store sushi - then I'm willing to stake my reputation on the fact that Safeway can outdo Fry's sushi any day or time of the week.  Anywhere.  Period.  I've never gotten bad sushi from Safeway, but I have, however, gotten bad sushi from Fry's.  How bad?  ...praying to the porcelain Gods all night long bad.  

Safeway sushi is fresh.  It tastes fresh.  It smells fresh.  Their itamae (sushi chefs) are excellent at what they do and their ingredients are the freshest around.  Again, I'm not going to sit here and tell you that the sushi you can buy from Safeway on Happy Valley in their little plastic container is better than what you're going to get from a 4-star restaurant in Scottsdale.  God knows I've had better... BUT for grocery store sushi, it's pretty darn good.  :)  Check my pics!  Their sake is excellent.  Their maguro is phenomenal.  Their poke is good and their ebi is sweet.  Their prices are more than fair.  Just how I like it.  

If you've not yet had the opportunity to try their sushi at Safeway on Happy Valley or perhaps you've walked past it while heading over to the bread aisle, do me a favor and check it out.  You won't be disappointed."}

Setting the bar for grocery store sushi...

Ah, the despair of grocery store sushi. I don't know why I inherently frown upon it - probably because most rolls look a little sad and the price tag is generally equivalent or greater than what you'd expect to pay in a cute little sushi restaurant - and cute little sushi restaurant happy hour will most definitely beat grocery store sushi in both price and quality. But sometimes, you just need to grab and go. Ya know? 

Well, took a chance here and we weren't disappointed. The two workers behind the counter were very friendly, the fish all looked fresh and they were slicing away as I stood there on a Wednesday around 4:30 pm. I requested extra ginger and the lady gladly took one of my containers and filled it up. She was very proud of her sushi/sashimi offerings, so that was very pleasant. 

The seaweed salad was the only item that looked absolutely pathetic not to mention tiny, and not worth the near five bucks they wanted. 

Will visit here again in a pinch. 

Note: not truly a sushi bar/no sushi bar seating but there are tables in the store"}
