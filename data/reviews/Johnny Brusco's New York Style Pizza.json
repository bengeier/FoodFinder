{"text":"The food was awesome!!  I'm from New York and we know something about pizza and such. The Stromboli almost made me cry. And don't forget to order the chocolate cake!!!....your love it!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend taking the time to find out if the food has improved.  Sad... the owner should read the reviews and figure out what is going on.  The crust was limp and the sauce was scarce.  About the best thing that I can say about the pizza was that it was that I will not get acid reflux from eating it.  There are much better places in the South Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Was there last Friday night.  This place now serves the best pizza per my picky kids.  Personally it was very good. The staff provided prompt service, especially on my limited time schedule.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Decent pizza but not top notch as one of the other places in the area.   The staff is ok but guess I am used to a certain caliber of pizza and this is not that high up there.   A lot of the locals seem to like it though."}
{"text":"I agree with Ed on this one, usually good food. But this time I was concerned about the cleanliness of the place. Kids working making pizzas and messing around - quality is not there anymore. If you got your kitchen in customers view, try not to have kids use there shirts to wipe there nose, and get back to pizza making with out washing hands, and taking a pan and sticking it in another employees behind- that's just gross.   I am from NY, and worked at pizza joints in my day.  I thought I could enjoy a little bit of it here, but I guess not  Dominos is on the other side of the center. Cheap, not delicious- but will take better safe food practices any day.  Will start coming back after this location starts getting better reviews."}
{"text":"Today was our first time eating here.  The service was friendly and we were seated promptly.  The food wasn't good but it wasn't bad either.  The prices aren't to bad, but I expected a little more from the food.  Overall, it was a good experience and I'll give them another try."}
{"text":"Have been a customer since they have opened.  Their staff is friendly and never fails to recognize returning customers.  Pizza is fantastic and can be ordered anyway you want it.  Plethora of ingredients for toppings.  All other items I have tried are great buffalo chips appetizer is money!  They are also very active in the community in helping the local schools.  Contrary to some reviewers, they have always been nice and friendly to my entire family.  Minutes from my house is a bonus, this place is great!"}
{"text":"We've been eating here for about a year and even though it's a hike from our house, it's worth it!!! The best is eat-in because leftover is not as good as other pizzas. Don't know why that is, but there you have it. The garlic rolls are amazing, the sause is TDF (to die for).  Wish there was one closer to our house.....no, take that back, we'd all be heavier."}
{"text":"I love the eggplant Parmesan sandwiches. The bread is crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Best bread ever!  The sauce is seasoned just right but doesn't overpower the taste of the eggplant.   My hubby loves the calzones and pizza. And our daughter loves the ravioli.   Yum."}
{"text":"Not only was the service slow, but it was the laziest looking pizza I've ever seen. The toppings looked like they had just been dumped on top of a plain piece of cheese pizza as an after thought. Def. will not be going back there! No way they should be able to call that \"New York style pizza\""}
{"text":"Finally a place in Charlotte to get real pizza. Crust is hand tossed and the sauce is real pizza sauce not just bland tomato sauce.  I have always had good service and the quality has been great. This is not Dominos pizza."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the stromboli and both were disappointed.  Both were very hard in the bottom and doughy on the inside.  The bottom was burnt by I think something else in the oven. And the small lettuce sale was way over priced for the size.  Next time we will stick to pizza."}
{"text":"Service has gone downhill. Must be new poor management, because mostly the same staff. Pizza came out basically raw, the dough was uncooked . We ate there frequently, I gave them benefit of the doubt and tried it out again. It was worse!"}
{"text":"I stopped in because of the positive yelp reviews.  The bartender was friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable.  The cheese steak was good (Not a philly but not a bad steak sandwich), and the ambiance seemed nice.  I only picked up take-out, but the beer selection, patio, and specials seemed great, and we'll definitely be back to try a sit-down dinner!"}
{"text":"The pizza was terrible and horrible! The Mariana sauce was spicy and sour (which it shouldn't be), tasted exactly like a frozen pizza. They don't have good cooks or something today as I expected decent food. Even Pizza Hut would have been far better. There are many places that have cheaper prices which serve more authentic pizza with more portions. I suggest going somewhere else with your money."}
{"text":"Even though our family stopped in on a busy Saturday night, with a large group there from the Corvette Club we received exemplary service from our waiter, Connor, who saw to our every need and offered great suggestions when we decided on the wings.  Two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Love going there on Friday nights!  Typically get in right away!  Susan the hostess is great and remembers us!  Love the pizza!  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent and made exactly to order, including special instructions. Online ordering site is very easy to use."}
{"text":"Usually get great food here but on our last trip my strombolli  was undercooked and the wife's stuffed shells were still frozen on the inside  Our waitress was wonderful at least"}
{"text":"This place defines mediocrity. After two visits I feel ready to write a review, pretty sure it is a consistent place. First the food ( main reason to visit a restaurant )  I have tried a pepperoni pizza and lasagna. The toppings on the pizza were good but the crust  was on par with some frozen pizzas I have tried......nothing special. Next the lasagna, I always try lasagna at a Italian restaurant, to me it defines Italian. Once again  mediocre, the sauce, meat and cheese was pretty good but the pasta was soggy at best. Now on to the staff....if you are looking for warm fuzzy, this is not your place. I can't say rude, but not overly friendly.....mediocre. Price wise, for the caliber of food I would have to say it is a bit pricey. The place itself is nice, well maintained and cozy enough. Lots of flat screens and what appears to be a good beer selection. Bottom line....this place is in a small shopping strip in the boonies which I am sure is the reason it still open. If they were near any real competition at all I would never set foot in there. Bottom line.....I give Johnny Brusco's NewYork style pizza 2 George Costanzas. Mediocrity at it's best."}
{"text":"Came in for just a slice, unaware of their Tues $2 special... Ate 3 slices, which the pep tasted better than the cheese. Topped it off w/a slice of Oreo cookie bash. Pretty good for a snack before dinner!"}
{"text":"My family loves this restaurant. It has a neighborhood restaurant atmosphere. The food is excellent, the service is great and the vibe is very friendly. I've been alone for lunch, dinner with friends and family. Where I work also had a private event on their patio. I know my boss was very happy."}
{"text":"Convenient, Clean and good wait staff.  Food is authentic and delicious."}
{"text":"Above average NY pizza shop that you find around here. Pizza by the slice and a nice little beer bar with a good selection of on tap local and micro brews.   I've been here several times now and I'll give you a rundown on what we had and my opinion.   Lasagna. Had high hopes for this one but fell flat. I appreciate that you are trying to create another menu item for variety but cross utilization of products doesn't necessarily mean the menu item will be great. We ordered this one togo. When I got home it was piping hot, which is always nice. The issue is that it was so soupy. Another half of cup of marinara and it woulda been Italian Cup O Noodles. It was so soupy that It leaked out of the box and all inside the togo bag.   House Stromboli. This is the best thing I've had here so far. Well stocked with cheese, ham, pepperoni and capicolla.  It was baked to perfection and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Would order this again.   Pizza by the slice. Now I'm not sure if this was just us or if this is standard. I know all pizza shops have their own standard and so this could totally just be my bugaboo. In my opinion, NY Pizza is suppose to be thin, light sauce and enough cheese for coverage but not too much to make you gag. You should be able to fold it, hold it up and it stick straight out before you take that first mouth watering bite. The slice here was limp as a dishrag. So limp that when I went to cut into pieces that it just fell apart into this saucy wet dough mess. Server immediately replaced upon my request. Second slice had a good bit of oven char from the stone not being brushed in my opinion.   Pizza/Marinara Sauce. One again, my opinion. Sauce had a bell pepper profile and was so sweet. I'm guessing they use california tomatoes instead of Italian which tends to be a little more rich and earthier.   I'm gonna try one or two more menu items until I just stick with ordering the House Stromboli.   Upside. The restaurant has always been clean and the owners and staff have been very friendly and inviting. Definitely has the feel of a neighborhood joint and not part of a larger chain."}
{"text":"I don't know why there are bad reviews here. We love, love this place. The bruschetta is the best I ever had. The baked ziti with a side of meatballs is my fave. Pizza is good too. I have yet to be disappointed and we have gone 10 times in the last 4 months."}
{"text":"NYC transplant still on his journey for a NY Slice... Johnny's labeled itself as a new York style pizzeria and unfortunately it just missed it's mark. I ordered the Cheese Slice with Caesar Salad. Salad was solid, abut it was the Slice that didn't cut it for me.   Don't get me wrong it's alright,  thin crust with a good layer of cheese did it's job. But, the sauce tasted like it was out of a jar (no bueno)...   Price is alright and the location is spacious and with enough well placed TV's that you are bound to have a good time with or without friends.  Hope you enjoy your slice! Ciao."}
{"text":"Lunch menu is on point! You get 2 slices of pizza plus a drink for about 6 bucks. Pizza is good! Tip is obviously not included! Service is good, place is nice, I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"So, a two-star rating is the absolute best I can do.    Let me frame my experience as a reviewer first.  I am a school trained chef with over 30 years in the kitchen.  One of my first jobs as a teenager was learning the pizza business working for seven Italian brothers in NY.    We ordered a large plain pizza, white pizza, calzone and a house salad with oil and vinegar.  The mozzarella in the pizza and calzone was low quality and all three items were oily/greasy to the point where bag and box were soaked thru in many places.   The pizza dough was over-proofed and the evidence was multiple bubbles which in turn push in the sauce and cheeses from the edges.  The sauce on the regular pizza was acceptable.  The white pizza was ripe with powdered garlic, (wow).   The calzone was average and as flat as a pancake.  No rise and barely any stuffing as most of it leaked out. The \"house\" oil and vinegar dressing was not dressing at all.  It was an overly strong wine vinegar and salad oil, (not olive oil).  No seasoning at all.  My wife choked in the strength of the vinegar and it's overpowering effect.  Won't revisit."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food is ok, but the service is terrible.  My last and final visit we never got waited on.  It's a seat yourself place and we sat for nearly 10 minutes and watched server after server walk by us and never looked our way."}
{"text":"While the service has never been an issue, our most recent visit this past Tuesday left a lot to be desired. Stopped in to take advantage of the $2.00 slices...we ordered garlic bread while waiting. Our slices arrived shortly after and all I am able to presume is that they were sent through the microwave! The crust was \"sloppy\"..no crispness at all. Sent it back for what I hoped was to solidify the pieces a bit more in oven..upon return of slices it looked and tasted like nothing further was done. Even my son who never complains about his pizza felt the same. Very disappointing...not sure if we'll ever return"}
{"text":"Brusco's does a great job of delivering very solid pizzas with a nice selection of Italian dishes.  I've eaten here three times and never been disappointed in either the food or service. Last time, I took a Brooklyn native with me who said it was a damn good pizza and especially liked the crust. The service staff has always been very friendly and quick.   It should be noted the place opened up in June, so a previous post complaining about the service should have taken into account the staff was still in a learning stage. That being said, I've never had an issue with the service."}
{"text":"Great place to eat very friendly staff awesome owner came and introduced himself to us. Food was excellent had a Stromboli huge thing is huge at taste great. They also have beer great place to hang out with friends enjoy some great food."}
{"text":"The food quality and quantity has declined in the past 5 months. We ordered Chicken Parmesan take out...the first time was excellent, the second time the chicken was smaller and less sauce. The third time there was no sauce on the noodles (literally no sauce)The food was dry, the salad had spoiled cucumbers, brown lettuce and the lasagna dinner was dry too. So disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is a great little neighborhood pizza joint, but with a more extensive menu. Good subs, lasagna, and salads. The pizza is very good. Its a traditional hand's style, with a thinner, chewy crust.   The real deal is at lunch- two slices with one topping each and a drink for $5!   JBs is tucked away in a Harris Teeter Shopping center off Poplar Tent Road, so closer to Concord Mills than what most people think of as Concord. Check it out."}
{"text":"Can't beat bruscos! Wraps huge, pizza and pasta \"banging\"...pizza by the slice, cold beer and fried ravioli"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times with no complaints but tonight I received disappointing food and service. The buffalo chicken wrap is supposed to have grilled chicken - mine had stringy canned chicken and a ridiculous amount of hot sauce. A runner brought our food. Our waitress never came back to check to see if it was good and never refilled our drinks. I had to flag her down twice to get her attention. Others at my table enjoyed their cheesesteak sandwiches. I won't be back."}
{"text":"First dining experience since we moved into the area and WOW!  The bar has been set high!  Staff was courteous and attentive, and food was awesome.  The host suggested the OMB Mecktoberfest season, and man was he on the mark! Pizza is either awesome, or garbage in my opinion, and this was awesome.  I ordered two slices, but was regretting the second slice since the one slice was big enough to fill me up. Great NYC feel and atmosphere, even though there was a lot of NY  Yankees paraphernalia on the walls (I asked the owner about it, and he said his cousin made him put it up, and that he was a die-hard Mets fan). Great food, great hosts!  Noosh!"}
{"text":"Good pizza and wings. This is definitely a place I will return. I will never eat pizza from Pizza Hut, Papa John's or Dominos again!"}
{"text":"I've reviewed this place before, but tonight they redeemed themselves a little. We had the pizza, which is always good, as well as wings. The wings were great and the service was even better. This place is 1 mile from my house and is love to have somewhere besides Pippas to hang out!  I've reviewed this place before, but tonight they redeemed themselves a little. We had the pizza, which is always good, as well as wings. The wings were great and the service was even better.

{"text":"Teriyaki wings are delicious and crispy! BBQ chicken pizza is THE BOMB! LOL  Check them out!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has replaced the Wolfgang Puck Bistro that recently closed. I'm being gracious here with 2 stars. The first time I went last week, the service was extremely slow. He swiped my credit card and finally handed me my receipt 20 minutes later. It took him 15 minutes to come to me and apologize, but even then, he didn't tell me what was going on. He kept walking back and forth and talking on the phone with someone, because the computer was not cooperating.  The interior of the place is nice though, with flat-screen TVs on the sports channel and nice bar to sit at. The other workers there seemed to be having a good time as well.  The food was bleh. I had the Baked Feta and Marinara starter, which was basically garlic bread with a huge bowl of marinara sauce mixed with feta cheese. Also, they gave me the wrong order. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap, and when I got home, I opened up a chicken bacon ranch wrap. Oh well!! Thumbs down to this place. If I go back, it will be just to see if their pizza is any better."}
{"text":"For a chain type pizza place the food is pretty good . The best item we have had off the menu is the wings.  The pizza is decent, but not great.  The salads are good but not great.  The garden salad is just iceberg lettuce, a couple tomatoes, a few slices cucumber and onion.  Could have used some olives or peppers, but the oil and vinegar dressing is great.  Overall a good solid pizza place, just not as good as some of the more authentic NY style pizzerias."}
{"text":"Positively the best atmosphere in a pizza joint around.  The staff is very friendly and the food is great.  Great heated outdoor seating and TVs to watch the game."}
{"text":"I gave these guys the benefit of 3 tries - but they struck out. First time I got a calzone that was cold inside - so they had to go stick it back in the oven (and that was after waiting a good while for it the first time round). Second time, the pizza was forgettable - and the service was slow. Third time, I walked in and sat at the bar to order - I was there for 10 minutes without anyone even looking my way - so I got up and left. It was like everyone was busy chatting with each other behind the counter. This joint won't be around long I predict - too bad because the location is pretty good and the Brusco's on the north side of Charlotte is pretty good in comparison. I wanted to like it - but 3 tries is my limit..."}
{"text":"If you live in Highland Creek or Sky Brook area. This pizza joint is a great addition to the other restaurants around our hood. You can order by the slice or pie. Great place to have a quick beer and slice of pizza. Beer specials during the week. New York style pizza with attitude. Small bar area with plenty of free parking. I'll give it 5 stars just because I like their NY attitude & close to home."}
{"text":"This is a nice enough place but there's nothing great about. The food is okay but again not the greatest. Given how close it is to the house, I will be back, but, at this point, it isn't a first choice for me. Service can be somewhat slow."}
{"text":"Good on the way home and need to pick up dinner or a Friday night pizza place.  Everything I have had was delicious.  My kids love their food as well."}
{"text":"I often stop in here for a sub after work.  The place has grown a lot due to all the new neighborhoods in the area and it seems that they are trying their best to expand as much as they can however there are not enough tables so go early or do take out.  Pizza is pretty tasty but I love their meatball subs and their hotwings.  I think they need to expand their menu just a little bit or perhaps jazz it up a bit.  The quality of food is really good but sometimes they occassionally the mark on consistency and service.  You can get 2 hearty meatball subs and 7 wings for around $30 always hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Amazing service and wonderful food!  Truly enjoy the atmosphere and cleanliness of the restaurant. Feels like home."}
{"text":"Ended up at Johnny Brusco's after receiving poor service at another pizza restaurant (The Pizza Loft at Gianni's in downtown Concord) and became an instant fan. The service was spectacular, the waitress was friendly and the pizza was delicious.  I would recommend  the fried ravioli's and the extremely cheesy, and mouth watering, Four Cheese Pizza. They have a vast assortment of specialty pizzas and Italian dishes.  Definitely the best pizza in Concord."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food and Deanna. Writing this negative review hurts my souls because the food and service was great. But there was a guy, who seemed as if he was a manager or maybe even the owners son, who was just sitting down on his phone barking out orders to his employees. I've never experienced a manager speaking to his employees in this way, which leads me to believe they have a lot of employees turnover, and find it hard to retain employees with that kind of management. It really discourages me from wanting to return to eat if that's the way they treat employees. I can recommend a book, \"the three signs of a miserable job: a fable for managers\" by Patrick Lencioni, that may assist with your future endeavors. If i worked there I would've quit on the spot."}
{"text":"Great pizza and a nice place to eat. I Sat in and ate yummy pizza I have also had take out from here as well both great  I have only had the pizza I will go back and try some other foods"}
{"text":"Nothing special, nothing awful either. I had a cheese steak that was just alright. I didn't care for the seasoning but, that may be a personal preference. My wife had  a buffalo chicken sandwich that she said tasted like straight tabasco. So I guess that could be good or bad based on your level of love for tabasco. Service was ok but, not great. I'm sticking to my local non-chain places."}
{"text":"I love Johnny Bruscos. Great pizza, really yummy garlic knots, and good pasta too. Prices are reasonable. They have good lunch specials. Staff is friendly. I definitely recommend this place for some delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"I hate that I didn't like this place. It's around the corner from my house. I'm obsessed with Pizza and unfortunately this just did not do it for my tastebuds. Pizza was bland and sauce had no flavor, the crust was very soft and not crispy, I should of asked them to over bake my pizza twice more. The staff and owner were great and the bar selection was great!"}
{"text":"Continue reading only if you're ready for the unfiltered truth:  The Good... As a born and bred New Yorker, I can attest that this is pretty close to New York style pizza.  It is delicious!  I have also had their wings and salad before.  None of it disappoints.  Also the place is clean and you won't wait long for your food at all.  Parking has never been issued for me.   The Bad... However, their prices are a bit escalated.  The food is good, but this is not fine dining.  There are at least nine other places locally where you can get pizza just as good or better.  And save some moola.  Clear, example Harris Teeter sells pizza nearly next door.  Their slices are at least AS good.  The prices are a fraction of what JB charges.    The Ugly! With respect to the positive reviews I have never received the friendly service or the pleasant environment others wrote about.  They are rude, rushed and curt towards me.  They have always acted as if I was interrupting them in the midst of doing their taxes or something else important and frustrating.          Today I really wanted pizza.  This is the closest pizzeria to our home, but I debated long and hard about going in there.  I really abhor poor customer service, but I hadn't been in there so long, and the sign on the door said \"Yelpers love us,\" so I figured I would give it another shot.           As soon as I walked in I stopped to read the specials board and this man (the man who is always there) comes up and says  curtly, \"Do you know what you want yet?\" As if I have already been there ten minutes wasting his time.         I asked for a minute as I had just come in.  When I was ready to place my order, I approached him.  He had a scowl on his face and proceeded to rattle off the up charges that were applicable to my order.          I was in no mood to deal with this miserable, miserable man, plus pay his exorbitantly high prices nor trust him not to violate my food.  I have no idea if this attitude is just his way, and he is actually a harmless, sweet curmudgeon with a heart of gold.  Or perhaps I bare a resemblance to someone he despises,  or I just have the unfortunate luck to ALWAYS catch him at the worst possible time.          Either way...  Come off it!   Dude, you're just selling pizzas not disarming a bomb.  And every person deserves respect.  Life is too short and options are too plentiful for this.  I left; I don't need to take attitude and pay money for it too."}
{"text":"Food has gone way down hill, I used to eat here all the time but every time there is a change in management or ownership(which is often) the food quality gets worse. I went in two weeks ago for some takeout and ordered spaghetti and meatballs. Once I received my food I got in the car to drive home. The food really smelled bad in the way home but I was so hungry when I got home that I tried to eat it anyway. Needless to say it was awful. I've had better out of a can. This place has gotta step up their game or they will fail."}
{"text":"So we have been coming here for over 6 years and usually it's not too bad of a wait. But tonight, with maybe 5 tables of customers, we waited. We made our food selections and then waited, for about 10 minutes, then another customer came, sat down and was promptly waited on, then another a few minutes later. Even with a busboy cleaning tables all around us we still waited, invisibly.   I will never come here again.   Don't put out a sign asking people to seat themselves if you can't hire people to do the job you hired them for. Neglecting the customer doesn't make the company money or make the customer happy. I'm a business owner and cannot imagine doing this to my customers."}
{"text":"Good for any day dinner, you can go there the night of the big game, has a good selection of buffalo wings, good for kids. Has a good selection of drinks has great appetizers, great place overall anybody should go."}
{"text":"Lunch menu options are really good. I got the Stromboli, which was almost too big, but it was delicious and perfectly cooked. Close to work and great prices."}
{"text":"Stopped in and ordered to go for dinner. Ordered a salad, a dozen wings, and chicken parm. Waited an hour. When I complained the server dropped my order in the trash and said if you don't want it leave. I left.   (Edit 3/16)  To his credit, the majority owner, Mike, just called me personally and apologized and offered to make things right. I think this was a case of an employee who had a bad day and reacted emotionally to an upset customer.  Mike was very helpful and I'll give them another chance. I really do prefer their wings, so I hope my next experience will be awesome.  Will revise star rating after my next visit."}
{"text":"Great pizza place! I have never been unhappy with my pizza or wings here. Good drink specials, great food, and friendly staff. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"So disappointed. It's misleading to advertise New York style pizza. The crust is incorrect. The cheese is incorrect.  Our fresh basil tomatoes pizza was sprinkled with 5 specks of basil and chopped tomatoes. Need verification, but we think the tomatoes are canned chopped tomatoes. The pies were drowned with too much cheese (cheap shredded mozzarella)."}
