{"text":"Honestly i didn't even want to give this amateur company one star.. This place does not even have beef balls. This place has two kinds of beefs one which is advertised as new zealand beef, i am 100% certain it is now. This place is only 16.99 for late night ayce, it is really cheap but id rather go to hipot in the same plaza which is a bit more expensive but one of the best places ive been to. Do not waste your time coming here."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night. Newly opened so it's clean and nice inside. 10% off plus half free fresh lobster per person! That was amazing... the lobster was still moving on our plate! Fresh food, but a small selection compare to other places. Soup was good, but not very spicy even when you get extra spicy. Service was okay since there was only one lady working as server. Smaller tables set up so may not be accommodating for large groups.

I would recommend/come back."}
{"text":"7/10 for the quality, 8/10 for the service, 7/10 for the value. 7/10 overall (not an average).

Very friendly and helpful staff. Even came and chatted a little from time to time. But then there were only two tables, including us, so can't say how great the service is if it's busy.

Came for dinner. 23.95 per person + 2 dollars for weekend. Comes with half a lobster and a plate of seafood, which includes a mussel (okay), a fanny bay oyster (pretty huge, tasted great), a tiger shrimp (not for me, but my mom thought it was ok), some fish fillet (not sure what that one was, not that great), and some other stuff. Initially I thought it was kinda expensive per person, but considering that the lobster and oyster were nice and big, it's not that bad. For those wondering, after 10pm is 16.95 per person, without the plate of seafood and lobster.

The beef and lamb were pretty good. Just the right amount of fat on the meat (but that's kinda subjective). The wontons were pretty good.

The downside for this place, compared to other typical places, is that there isn't much selection in terms of sauces. I like other places where you get to go out, get your own sauces, and make your own concoction. Here we just get some soy sauce and a dish of satay sauce. Even if I can't make my own, I wish they had more sauces.

Also they don't have beef balls and beef tendon balls. Also they only have the omasum beef tripe and not the reticulum tripe. Too bad :(

Each adult person gets one plum juice. Additional ones cost money. Also other drinks also cost money. If I remember correctly, little sheep at warden has a all you can refill fountain.

When the bill first came, it was written. They added 10 percent charge on the bill, and the bill didn't indicate that it was tip. It almost looked like tax if I didn't examine it properly. When I asked them about it and then paid, they came back with a printed bill that actually came out to be a bit more expensive (calculated tax on top of the tip whereas it was 10% pretax before). It almost seemed a little shady. I was gonna give this place 10/10 service, but I knocked it down to 8 for that.

Not sure if I would come back. I kinda prefer Hipot (which is almost like right beside it) over this one in terms of selection, for stuff that I like having)."}
{"text":"Honestly, no. This place is just terrible.

This place is cheap at ~$16 a person. But unless you're really desperate and have no expectations, do not come here. If you want to eat comfortably, do not come here. Even with 10% off, I was disgusted enough to never want to come back. 

To start, there is one really horrible employee: a middle-aged woman with glasses. Her attitude is just bad. For example, even if her hands are empty and you try to pass her an order sheet, she'll say with a scowl on her face and furling her eyebrows, \"Just order later!\" (in Cantonese).  While all other staff were working as fast as they could to take orders and clear dishes, this one individual was slow and rude. I don't know why she was at the door most of the time, because she was the most unpleasant of all servers. It was a full-house at 7:15pm on a Thursday, and she was telling people to leave when they came in the door, saying there were no spots left as opposed to telling them \"one-hour wait\" or something like that. I'm not joking: she'd wave her hand in people's faces and tell them to leave.

RESERVATIONS
---------------------------------
They have a \"fake\" reservation system. I called to make a reservation, but they didn't ask for my name or give me their name. I didn't realize it was strange at the time, but when we arrived, we learned that they do not actually record reservations; it's just for appearances. They asked us the name of the employee who took the reservation and all I could say was, \"I don't know. They didn't introduce themselves.\" 

Don't bother making reservations. If they ask you at the door, just say you have one and list any time you want. Because they don't write down reservations, they went solely by your word.

WAIT
---------------------------------
We waited about 30 minutes, which I didn't think was that bad, but it was also because we had a reservation so we were first in line. While we were waiting, people who were sitting down eating were telling us - without us asking - how bad the place was. They told us that while the beef and lamb were alright, the \"specialty\" items (like deep fried chicken wings and mantou) were scammy because you'd never get them, regardless of how many times you ordered them. 

Once the table we were waiting for left, we sat/stood at the table for another 20 minutes before anyone cleaned the table and removed the dishes. 

FOOD & MORE WAITING
---------------------------------
We waited another 20 minutes to get a pot with our soup base. At this point, we learned to ask anyone BUT the one terrible server because they other servers were actually helpful and polite. 

The pork soup base is fine. The beef soup base looked like dirty leftover water that was used to wash a steak or something. Clear with floating pieces of brown and white, it did not look very appealing. 

The beef and lamb were fine and really everything else was fine too, but as we expected, the deep fried mantou didn't come after several reminders and over an hour wait. I'm not sure how they track orders because a server was walking towards another table with some deep fried chicken wings so we asked her if we could order some and she just dropped off two dishes of wings. Who were they originally for? We didn't really understand. 

CLEANLINESS & UNSANITARY LACK OF VENTILATION
---------------------------------
The restaurant just feels cramped. The floor underneath our table was slippery and gross and remained uncleaned even after we asked. 

At the end of our meal, we noticed condensation was dripping from the ceiling into our pot. We assume the fans weren't on or weren't strong enough. But that's just gross. 

All in all, I would never come back and I would warn people to stay away."}
{"text":"This was the first time I tried this hot pot place and to be honest, I was not too impressed. Although the staff was nuce and friendly, they messed up our reservations and the food service was just too slow. The menu selection for all you can eat hot pot was small and the sauce choices that they bring to the table was very limiting. Overall, although nice friendly staff, the service was slow, and food selection was small."}
{"text":"this is our first and last time coming to this place. we are here to try out new hot pot place cuz of the 15.99 special plus additional 10% off, sounds pretty good. we'll I can say the food r pretty good, the decor r nice too, what kills this place is that mid aged lady with glasses, she's simply very rude and yelling at customers, giving us shit faces and pretend she didn't hear us, when we arrived the place there were already others waiting in the line, I can tell they are short staffed but this woman never greet us or anything like that, then another group of people came in after us and went to this woman directly and ask for number, then immediately after we told her we are here before they do, and she blame us for not asking for a number when we arrived (I was like how do I supposed to know whether u r giving out number or what?!! nobody greet us so that's why we just stand there and wait), anyways, it's really our first time got yelled by the waitress and we immediately know this will be our last time coming here... too bad, as long as this woman is here then this restaurant won't survive long"}
{"text":"Really 3.5 stars.  Came here for a late night dinner (read after 10pm), 50% full and was seated at a front both which is OK with me.  Was asked what broth ib wanted and that the 15.95 price includes a few of the small snack  dishes, everything else was to be marked off ourselves.  The soup base came promptly along with a flask of plum juice.  Took our order for v snacks v and also the order sheet.  The food came quickly and everything was very fresh.  I really liked the freshness of the vegi's and the fresh home made dumplings.  The beef was top notch and nothing bad to be said.  They do have quite the selection of items and for what we ordered, no complaints.  If you are one that requires an egg to accompany your dipping sauce, you need to ask them.
For the price and variety, I will be back."}
{"text":"Hmmmmmmmm... Where to start with this one. As far as hot pot places go. I can't really say anything bad about this place. Its clean, service was good (but our waitress didn't speak an ounce of english), meat and veggies were fresh and the inclusion of seafood in the price is nice. But that's about all I can say. The biggest disappointment was the lack of sauces to create your marinade. All we got was soy and garlic. We had to ask for vinegar, and nothing else was really available. For that reason alone, I can't give it more than 3 stars. As fresh as the food was, having only soy to dip it in killed it for me. Pricing was average, but to me there are plenty of better places to have hot pot than here."}
{"text":"We were hungry or at least I was hungry and it is past 10:30 pm, Shangri-La Hot Pot Restaurant seems to be a good option for some AYCE hot pot action!

Grand Opening Special 10% off but they added 10% Service Charge to the bill. 

Since the Chinese name ???? of Shangri-La is Spicy Hot Pot (there is no direct relation between Chinese and English), I decided to order one of the spicy broth to try for a surcharge of $4.50. For the basic broth without surcharge, they only have the plain broth. Spicy is not that spicy at least if you can eat as spicy as me. I would opt for extra spicy next time. 

Though the choice of item available is a limited, but they all prepared well. Canadian AAA Beef and New Zealand Lamb on the menu which were pretty good cut. I like the home made wontons too. The vegetables was fresh and washed properly Whole shrimp with heads on was good too.

We were the only table here so we got good service. The lady checked on us frequently and even brought out free refill of plum juice in a jar for us without us requesting.

Shangri-La is not a bad option if you want some late night hot pot since it is open till 2 am especially on a cold wintery night!"}
