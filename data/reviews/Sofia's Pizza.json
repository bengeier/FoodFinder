{"text":"We had a late delivery from them dun burgers and carrot cake and the burgers over cooked and cake hard over price and was not happy with the food in any way called them back they played pass the buck for a day before finally after talking to 4 employee's then the so called manager did nothing but fight with me made threats of coming to my house and doing what?? Lol no respect no business ethics at all they give any asshloes a business ouy here in vegas the service industry \"\"\" but have the shitty service and don't care what mistakes they made!# never again will I call or use eat 24 or call sophifa s"}
{"text":"The place wasn't very clean and the lady taking my order was a bit rough. The bad customer service and bad food is enough for me to be one and done at this place."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza for myself and my two sons last night and wasn't disappointed in the quality at all. We got pizza, wings, and I got a slice of cheesecake to indulge in after they went to bed. All were tasty. My only complaint is that it took over an hour and a half for the delivery. If I had known that, I would have probably called a different establishment. By the time the food got to us, I had two very cranky children and I was quite cranky myself. Hoping for a better delivery experience next time around."}
{"text":"To be fair I only ate here once and it was delivered. That being said the pizza was burnt and it took over and hour to get the food."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good when you want a pizza.  They have a good one topping price for carry out $7.99.  Pretty affordable and tasty!"}
{"text":"Kept getting their menu stuck in our door and decided to try them tonight, wish I had thought to read these reviews first as I would not have ordered from them.   Ordered a two topping pizza sausage and    apparently only 3 slices of pepperoni.  The pizza had no flavor and the cheese and toppings (what there was of them) just slid off the pizza slices in one piece.  We would have been better off going to the grocery store and buying a frozen pizza, it would have tasted better and saved us some money.   I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Sofias Pizza is delicious and affordable... They are now open 24-7. , We usually just get basic cheese and pepperoni, the crust is tasty, plenty of cheese and cooked just right. Even the fries were good, they are the big steak fries....This is my new favorite place to get non \"little cesars\" God knows we can only take so much little C'S. Anyhoo I highly recommend Sofias"}
{"text":"Not happy at all. Pizza tasted like it was out of a freezer. Sauce was unimpressive and felt like it was out of a jar. The meatballs were disgusting and also tasted frozen. When I called an hour after I ordered the store clerk was extremely rude. When the delivery finally showed up they did not have the credit caRd machine so I had to call the shop back and process my card over the phone. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best pizza delivery with fresh ingredients!  Have it delivered as restaurant is very basic."}
{"text":"Bargain price for a nice, freshly made pizza. 7.99 for a 1 topping, 16 inch large pizza. Yummy dough , delicious homemade pizza sauce"}
{"text":"The person who answers the phone sounds rude, irritable, and annoyed. He deserves the worst customer service award. I never had anyone take my order and yell \"HELLOOO??!!\" I really wanted to like this place too because it opens late, my boyfriend likes the ribs here, I thought the salad was good with the price and portion. However after that experience, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery 6/26/13, at 7:50pm.  I had the Gyro Special that was $7.55 and it came with fries and a can of soda.  They have a choice of Beef, Lamb, or Chicken, and I chose the lamb, thinking it would be like a more authentic spit roasted lamb, but it came as the typical gyro roasted ground meat.  It was good, no complaints.  It seemed small at first, BUT they are generous with the meat, which made up for the size of the pita.  The fries are the steak style fries.  Reminded me of Fat Burger, \"Fat Fries.\"  Very good, and there were a ton.  Good deal on the Gyro.  Been a long time since I had a gyro, and this really satisfied my gyro fix I was looking for.  Also, I was in the mood for some BBQ ribs.  Ordered the Baby Back, ala carte.  Whole rack was $16.95.  They reminded me of the ones you can get pre-made at Smith's deli.  For the price, it was totally fine.  Tasted OK, fall off the bone tender, and were wrapped nice in heavy foil, no leaks.  Satisfied my craving for ribs.  Actually ate the rest for dinner the following night.    Ordered by phone.  The guys accent was thick and a little difficult to understand, but was cordial so that was fine.  Paid with CC and had them add tip.  Was told 35-45 minutes for delivery.  It came in 38 minutes.  I was pleasantly surprised by that.  Deliveries are usually way late from other restaurants.  I also want to mention that the kid who delivered it was friendly and very polite.  Nice, compared to the regular grumpy delivery guys from other restaurants that seem to be the norm in LV.    Overall, happy with it and will definitely order from them again.  They will be replacing Angelina's, who was my go-to until they did a really bad job on my last order with them. ____________________________  Follow-up 7/6/2013    I just ordered from Sophia's Pizza again.  Ordered at the busy time of 6:05 PM, and was told 40-50 mins.  All well and good for Saturday, at dinner time.  I ordered 2 gyro specials.  One Chicken and one Lamb.  Lots of fries just like last time.  Best part was that it came sooner than expected at 6:35.  Only 30 mins.  Great service, both times."}
{"text":"I stay 5 mins away from here , took a hour and 20 mins to get to me ....pizza was cold ... so dry I kept asking does this pizza have any sauce smh BBQ wings were the only thing that was good. Cuz mild wings were DRY AS FU&$ ....  I'm highly disappointed wasting $25 I could have just called the local dominoes ughhhhhhh"}
{"text":"Ordered the pizza deal for 14-inch chicken fingers and fries for only $20 bucks it was a great deal. They weren't stingy on their chicken fingers a full box was brought, fries tasted bad only down side of the meal. Everything tasted OK no wow here but for a large meal to over stuff three people try it out :)  Lady on the phone was nice, patient, and overall customer service is good on time delivery even at Lunch hours."}
{"text":"I am so upset with the service I received! I am 2 miles OFF the strip and this place wouldn't deliver to my resort (no traffic)!!!! The rude man on the phone kept insisting there was traffic here but there is none and of course I told him but I just got incredibly rude remarks back. Sad part is I was going to order 20 large pizzas for my party! Sucks for you jerk!!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give a negative star I would. Order took about an hour to get to me when they are only down the street from my bf's house. Then the \"Philly Steak Your Choice\" comes with NOTHING even when we asked for mushrooms, onions, and two different cheeses. Also not to mention the sandwich came with NO FRIES. The ONLY decent (not good because it arrived cold ) was the Fried Zucchini. Did I even mention the delivery person didn't know how to work their credit card machine? Supposidly the owner is back (per the review 28 days ago ) but nothing has changed. Should have listened to my gut & ordered somewhere else. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SPOT."}
{"text":"Shouldn't even deserve a star don't ever order food from this place I literally took two fries out of my order of curly fries and found a moth under the fries asked them to bring me my money back and the guy on the phone had a attitude about it also my friends burger has a big ass black spot on it DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE"}
{"text":"I'm in Vegas for a month and picked up a menu from here. The place was a bit dirty but gave it a try anyway. I understand pizzas are greasy, but this pizza was extremely greasy, very sloppy pizza. I doubt I'll order from here again. The only good thing is that they're open 24 hours."}
{"text":"This has to be the wrest place I ever ordered from we placed our order for delivery at 3 PM and finely I food showed up at 4:45  called in and asked of this was there norm and they said that there was alot of traffic that's why they are late, they told me 30 to 45 min to start my food was cold and not that great I would not recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. We ordered lunch for our co-workers and they got the order wrong. When we called to confront them, they said we were making it up. They didn't allow us to speak and explain what happened, just kept cutting us off. They charged us 4 different prices for the same pizza and wouldn't correct the problem, did not want to fix the order, did not try to make the customers happy. If we could give it a 0 star rating we would. When we  ate the pizza, it was hard and chewy. Waste of time and waste of money."}
{"text":"I ordered a family pizza deal that came with an order of 1/2 pound of chicken wings. When I came home with my order, opened the boxes the pizzas looked alright until I got to the CHICKEN WINGS more like hairy/boney wings! The worst wing experience ever! They had no meat and looked disgusting! Will never go back there again! Not even for FREE!"}
{"text":"Fast service for slices or cheese steaks before driving into the maze of the airport."}
{"text":"0 stars! rude customer service! He insisted deliver was too far, cursed then hanged up! such a barbarian"}
{"text":"After 60 min from ordering, I called in since I still haven't receive my order. They told me it would be anytime, they showed up 30 min later with hot wings, not boneless like I ordered and the pizza was burnt (black) and cold. I called and spoke with the manger who said there is nothing he could do. I told management I wanted a refund and he hung up on me three times. My husband husband called and was also hung up on. Worst e place ever, what a way to end my vacation!! :("}
{"text":"I've gotten food from here before and it is mediocre. I placed a delivery order online and apparently this location doesn't deliver to where i was located anymore. I called after about an hour and ask about my order, a male voice said \"we don't have any choppers to deliver that far and laughed\" i laughed and then he said he could transfer my order to a closer location and i said no thanks i would just like a refund and was promptly hung up on. I called back and he didn't say anything besides \"tell me your card number since you aren't cooperating\" I gave him my card number and he told me it should take 2-3 business days and i told him he shouldn't be rude and he hung up on me again haha. Plz don't bother with this mediocre establishment and don't even bother trying to get any customer service"}
{"text":"Pizza was decent, definitely not worth the price. Jalapeño poppers were good, wings are the worst wings I've ever ate.  Definitely tasted old and I'm 95% sure I will have the bubble guts in 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"Pizza isn't anything crazy but it's cheap and filling. Service isn't amazing, but definitely worth the deal. Also convenient that they're open late."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this is the worst customer service I have ever experienced.   This place is utter garbage. I ordered a pizza online to be delivered and waited about an hour and a half until I decided to call and check the status on the order. The person on the other line could not communicate properly seems like English was her umpteenth language.  At this point all I wanted was my money to be returned. The woman on the other line then hung up on me. I called again and asked for a manager and was immediately hung up. I called a third time and this time a different person answered and could hear the same female voice in the background asking who it was and then a mutter followed by another click. At this point I was pretty ticked off but decided to call back to be assured my money was paid back. The lady read back the card number I used asked for the expiration date quickly hung up without letting me get a proper word in. I needed proof of this refund so I decided to go to the shop. Some old guy with an attitude comes out after I ask the person at the front for a manager. The old man says there is no manager here what do you want.. dumbfounded by this i ask for who ever was in charge and the man says I am the owner... I think to myself this must be some sort of joke.. I recognized his voice as one of the people who hung up on me and even called him out on it, his response, \"I possibly hung up on you, you asked for a manager, there is no manager here so I hung up.\" Completely blown away by this I demanded my money back and after arguing for 5 minutes a lady came up and handed me a refund slip... I would not suggest this establishment to anyone. Not even my worst enemies. Complete garbage."}
{"text":"My family and I love love love the wings and fingers at Sofias!  The only thing I dislike is the girls who answer the phone are very rude ,  They do not greet you when they answer the phone all they say is sofias , I constantly had to say \"Hello\" to make sure I was still on the line ! Very poor customer service ! The food is really good though."}
{"text":"A friend lives and works nearby and orders regularly. I've stopped by a few times to pick up instead - but have never seen anyone eating in the restaurant itself. Pizza is always what's ordered, and it's really quite good - as long as you know how to order it.   They have a 5.99 extra large cheese pizza special - for pick up only. When ordering on the phone make sure to tell them you're picking up for a regular customer, as they tend to skimp on the sauce and cheese if that's all you're ordering. Sometimes I go in and wait while they make it - and then it's the best bargain, super cheesy and balanced perfectly with the sauce!   Crust type is your choice - I don't usually eat the crust, I eat theirs because it's so tasty. You can have thin or Chicago deep - any type of crust you like, all are hand tossed, and the pizzas are up to a true 16 inches, perfect for a group of people - which is usually what we do when a group of friends are getting together.   Pizza specials give great value, for example: two 16\" pizzas with 4 toppings each are only $22.50. Compared to Pizza Hut: 2 \"Large\" pizzas with 4 toppings each are $28. 'Nuff said.  They do deliver, and offer other food, chicken, burgers, salads and the like, I've seen the burgers and they look ok, and ordered the 1/2 chicken once - it was way too dry. I also understand they have more locations around Vegas, but this is the only one I've ordered from."}
{"text":"pizza is dank you have to come get a pizza only 750 for large  :) :) Very funny people and hard workers I love it here and also cheap"}
{"text":"I tried to order pizza from Sofia's via Grub Hub tonight. 10 minutes after placing the order I received an email and a call from a grub hub rep saying the restaurant called and said it was beyond their delivery area. I reached out to the restaurant to inquire. The girl on the phone rudely said it was beyond their delivery area for the night because they had \"other customers\". Mind you, this is on a Tuesday.  If the service is any indication of the food, (it often is) run from this joint. Their is a reason they have less than stellar reviews on Yelp."}
{"text":"This place is f...k orribile the pizza was nasty and raw  .. I don't know who make that pizza , and service so rude the owner is pice of shit dirty place  like that  should be closed !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Order shrimp scampi: 6 little salad shrimp, pasta was externally dry!!!! The garlic Bread was rubbery, and the side salad that came with it, I was scared of eating just by looking at it. !!!!  The whole thing is a disaster!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, ribs are amazing, but they forget stuff constantly. And heaven forbid you try and call and let them know. Places make mistakes, and I have no problem with that, but for the woman who answers to argue with you over it and tell you that it was your mistake or deny what it says on the menu is insulting. I've ordered two Caesar salads and never had any dressing, and the latest fiasco was when I ordered fingers and they didn't include fries. And she actually got mad at me and yelled that they don't come with fries. Both the hard copy menu and the yelp 24 app state fries. Every place and every person makes mistakes. But when you handle them like this, it makes it impossible to want to go back. I've loved this place for a long time and recommended it to everyone, but will be finding a new place from here on out. Their awful customer service has completely lost my business."}
{"text":"Im dissapointed in this place because they were serving good pizzas and fries and then out of no where they really started making them poorly... A few times they didnt add hardly any sauce and put so much cheese that it was sliding off, the crust was so thin that it was completely soggy , which they were making great pizzas before with a great price for pick up, its sad when a place you use to go to just completely does a 180 and starts to taste poorly. My brother was the one who recommended this place because it was his favorite but he also has had several bad pizzas that he almost never goes anymore (he use to go once a week)  now more like once every few months"}
{"text":"Just ordered a pizza and had everything explained to us, we ordered a Garlic Pizza asking Spinach to be put on one side only; pizza was delivered there was NO garlic sauce and if there was it was hard to find. The cheese appeared to be imitation, along with the fires. Adding that we specifically asked if they were \"home cut\" or cut in the store, and they're answer was \"yes\". They were both dry. An I debit if the fries were \"home cut\" or not because they seem to be \"from forzen\" an dipped in a frier. I called Sofia's an spoke with a gentleman that put the owner (????) on the phone, I believe he was not interested in listening to me an denying the validity of the food quality. He said I was the first person in 20 years to complain about his pizza's. He was unwilling to make it right, or bring us another pizza. He was very curt,  disrespectful and interrupted. So I suggest NOT ordering from Sofia's Pizza."}
{"text":"Rude wrong order poor customers service don't go here I will never go here food is not good at all"}
{"text":"The woman Yesenia charges extra for items add to a pizza . She couldn't understand if you only buy a half sausage half pepperoni pizza is equal to one topping . This place looks dirty and run down . Hope I don't get sick eating this pizza . They are also known as Hifhmile Pizza Inc ."}
{"text":"This place is great, pizza is made fresh and is so gooooood! Prices are even better!"}
{"text":"The menu looks very appealing but the pizza was bland. The crust tasted old and the cheese fell off the crust when you lifted the slice to eat it. The delivery guy was creepy, he kept glancing into my hotel room my wife and I were staying on our Vegas trip. He kept mumbling like he was high on drugs too. Not worth the $22 price."}
{"text":"I bought this disgusting ass pizza today and it gave me a stomach ache.  Plus, my mom said she found a hair in it.  I won't be going there any longer.  GO THERE AT YOUR OWN HEALTH RISK."}
{"text":"This place has awesome Gyros and delivery was really quick. The staff took the time to listen and made me feel like a real customer. I get their flyers on my door every now and then when they update the menus. Only thing i would recommend to Sofia's Pizza is creating an app so we can order our food for delivery and/or pick up. That way we can also see the full menu through our phones. This place is a good place to go and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.  Visiting from out of town and our resort was papered with menus so we thought we would give it a try. Ordered a signature pizza- Allegra- which as listed on the menu- choice of cappicolo ham or Canadian bacon. I wanted the ham- but they didn't have- so I settled for the bacon. Also ordered a half bucket of wings and a Caesar salad. I was told the order would be delivered 50-60 mins. The ordered arrived after 68 mins which in itself isn't terrible, but the pizza was ice cold. I called back to Sofias and mentioned the order was late and cold and was made to feel that that is what I should have expected. They offered nothing in the way of an apology so I told them I was going to write this review. We proceeded to eat our meal. I will admit the taste of the pizza was ok- but it was missing the bacon it was supposed to have. The Caesar salad was chopped romaine with croutons- no evidence of any bacon or parmesan cheese- that's pretty thin for $6.95. The wings were the only thing that made the meal truly palatable, although we ordered mild and they were too hot for both my parents to eat- spicy that is- certainly not temperature.  Over all- it there is availability to eat in at Sophie's and you could get it hot-might he a good experience. Until they purchase some delivery bags for their driver- I would suggest avoiding disappointment by ordering from a different establishment."}
{"text":"I ordered a stromboli a couple of weeks ago and it was the WORST I have ever tasted. It wasn't real sausage, more like ground beef. The dough was raw because the dough was extra thick at the ends. I wound up throwing it away. Never will I buy from them. The Bulgaria folks that owned it before were great. Never raw and REAl sausage. These people that took over must be trying to cut costs. BOO."}
{"text":"I guess my review is based on customer service or lack there of... because I never got my food. I'm wondering if this is even an establishment.  Stayed at a hotel on the strip and ended up getting a flyer under my door from Sofia's saying they're 24/7. My guy and I called the number on the flyer 16 times!!! I was thinking \"oh they're probably just really busy I'll order online\" not only was the online process the most difficult ass backwards BS I've ever had to deal with, but it literally took me over a half hour just to TRY to find the same deals as on the flyer. NOW IM PISSED... so not only am I settling at this point but I get a warning that this is going to take 40/60 min...ok that's fine but it's less than 5 miles from my hotel. I ordered at 10:59....here comes 11:15 and so I decided to try to call them again. Ring ring ring...no answer just like before. THEN, I decided to respond to the email that says \"if you have any questions reply to this email\".... mailer daemon immediately afterward. Thank God they don't run credit cards on the website and only at the door or I'd be one frustrated hangry foodie. So it's now 12:30 and I still haven't received food nor any communication from Sofia's. Cut your losses and seriously find something better. I was stoked on Jalapeño poppers and only got let down."}
{"text":"Patricia Phillips Spruell --  1 star We have been supporting this local business for 3 years. In the past few months the food has gotten worse and worse as has the service. Tonite my husband went in and ordered a cheese pizza. After waiting 45 minutes he asked what was taking so long and he was given a pizza from off the top of the oven and a nasty remark to go with it. He also had walked to the convenience store beside this establishment while waiting. The smell of dope was so strong he couldn't stand it .....and it was coming from outside Sofias back door where several of their employees were congregated. When he got home with the pizza and we opened it we were appalled that they would serve a pizza like it! Burnt....a huge bubble the size of a saucer....barely edible to say the least. My son was very hungry after waiting an hour for the thing so he took a piece and promptly spit out his first bite as it was so burnt!! So off we go to retun the pizza.The first guy we spoke with was attempting to be helpful when all the sudden here come a silly short fellow with an accent spewing nasty remarks! Thankfully he says they have audio cameras because I fully plan on having the owner watch the video and listen to the child in a man's body that works for him, as he speaks rudely to us! Did my husband swear? yes Did he get angry? Yes but to be treated this way when we spend probably $800.00 here every 2 weeks is enough to make anyone mad! We will never go back and will urge everyone we know to stay away from here as well. Oh they offered to make another pizza.....hahahah not falling for that.... as he said \"so I can spit on it\" as he walked away. Done with this place forever!"}
{"text":"Ordered tripple cheese bacon burger, and spaghetti & meat sauce.. Most crappy burger i ever tastet... Nevada are more jucyer than this burger.. No taste and no sauce..  Life is to short to eat here"}
{"text":"When in Vegas for a basketball tournament with hungry kids this is the way to go. The only reason for the 3 stars is they took entirely too long to deliver the pizza to our hotel. I had this food on a prior weekend with girls for a bachelorette party and the service was a lot more prompt. Nonetheless for the price and amount of food it's a great deal!"}
{"text":"Not only is there food terrible, but their manager hires extremely rude people to leave menus on doors.  I live in an apartment complex and I have had an 8X11 sign on my door for several months asking people to STOP leaving menus.  Yesterday, my window was open and I saw the guy leaving menus.  When I asked him if he saw the sign, he cursed at me calling me nasty names using racial slurs and walked off.  I would NEVER support a company that hires rude and racist people!"}
{"text":"We eat from here all the time. For the past 4 years the service just continues to get worse and worse. The food is really good the prices are awesome but the just can't stand the service anymore. The employees are always yelling and arguing with each other. It's family owned and operated they seem to just not get along lately. I placed a phone order for pick up. A philly cheese steak takeout special and a side of fries. I was told it would be a 10-15 minute wait. I get there about 12 minutes after ordering and my food was not done. The gentleman behind the counter told me a few more minutes and still nothing. Come to find out they had yet to even start my order. I continued to wait an addition 20 minutes and my order was finally done and not even an apology. This will be the last time I order from here."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 WELL DONE & THIN pizzas. One cheese, one extra and one green pepper, sausage, onion.  When I got my pizzas they were soggy, undercooked and all the toppings were in the center and there was about 2-3 inches of crust. The pizzas were so thick and soggy. I asked for thin and well done. So I called to see what was up with the pizzas and the woman on the phone was so rude.  So I paid for disgusting pizza and rude customer service. Pizza Hut would have been better than this."}
{"text":"Stay away from Sofia's pizza it has gone downhill! Frozen Costco or Sam's club meatball and sausage, #10 can of Marinara sauce ( No gravy here I was draining water off the sides of meat balls  and sausage and my Lasagna with meatballs.) The lasagna cheese was sour and they forgot my extra Garlic bread, the remembered to charge me for it though! Store closed when I got my delivery and calling both numbers did not allow for voicemail for my concerns. STAY AWAY FROM SOFIA'S PIZZA ORDER NAPOLI INSTEAD WHERE THE QUALITY IS CONSISTENT."}
{"text":"Review is only for the pizza.  One of the decent pizzas in town, still prefer sofia's over large corporate chains, can't say much else about the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery through Grubhub tonight.  The food was decent but arrived cold.  However, Sofias Pizza apparently does not know their own menu.  I ordered the lamb gyro special.  It comes with the gyro, fries and a drink.  It says this online and on their printed menu that came with the order.  I specified a sprite on the order form.  I also ordered a coke on the side.  The ordered arrive without a spite.  I called them and she said I only ordered a coke.  I explained that the gyro special comes with a drink.  They don't even offer it ala carte!  She sounds all confused and tells me she'll check the order and will call me back.  I never heard back from her.  So I filled a complaint with Grubhub and got a refund."}
{"text":"Very good value easy to order on yelp!!  Home made taste!!  Our family and football teams favorite!!"}
{"text":"Second time here. The pizza is really good. Not sure what they put in the dough to make it tastes so good and make it crunchy with the inside so soft. Looking at the rest of the menu I think I'm gonna be ordering lunch as well."}
{"text":"Sooooo good!! I was at a hotel near the airport... it was later at night.... I was starving and desperate. I ordered a small pizza along with a dinner salad. I expected nothing much. I WAS BLOWN AWAY! The salad was huge with all the goodies you want in the salad. The pizza crust was sooooo good. Not greasy, yet so flavorful.  Great price-Quick delivery-nice and helpful staff and delivery guy. I wish I would have taken a pic of the chicken salad so you could see how huge and bountiful it was. So great!! Thank you so much!!"}
{"text":"Ate here with a good friend of mine and it was my first time eating here by the way I got to say I was impressed the customer service is good from the time we ordered till the time we got are food they checked on us to see if the food was good or if we were good that was good to know. They have a good selection of food for a very reasonable price the only negative i can say about this place was the calzone I got was cooked all the way part of it was the other part was doughy and the cheese on that part along with the pepperoni was barely cooked but other then that everything was good from the drink to the fresh fries I might have to check this place out when it comes to ordering Pizza fries or chicken wings."}
{"text":"Surprised by the reviews for this place. As a native Vegas resistant, I'm fully aware of the quality or lack thereof of authentic pizza we have in this city. With that being said, for the price I paid for a 16\" pizza, it doesn't get much better than this. $6.50 for a 1 topping pizza!! How do you beat that?? Seriously incredible. A fresh made to order pizza for that price doesn't make sense. As for the other food on the menu, I can't speak on. But this is a pizza joint, so i would recommend eating ONLY pizza.   LOL to the fact they have ribs.  LOL to the fact people would actually go there and order ribs.  LOL to the fact people leave bad reviews about ribs ordered from a pizza joint.  LOL LOL LOL.   I will be back for this awesome $6.50 pizza!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was gross! Ordered a hawaiian pizza and it had mushrooms on it! Not like a few...like smoothered in it! The cheese was on top of all the toppings so when u went to take the slice out the cheese slid right off. I ate like 3 bites and threw it away! My coworkers did the same. Just gross! The delivery guy was gross looking and not professional at all! Never will we order from here ever again! Garbage!"}
{"text":"Really delicious food especially the cheesesteak. Excellent customer service! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I got the carry-out XL pepperoni special.  It was quick, hot and delicious.  No fancy frills, but tastes like real pizza which is more than can be said for many or the pizza places in the area. They also have a variety of other food, like french fries and snacks, that will keep the picky eaters happy.  Their other pizzas seem pricy, but not having tried them yet I can't vouch one way or the other.    Service was friendly and quick.  If you're the unsociable type who's bothered by staff speaking foreign languages, just stay away.  Personally, I couldn't care less when the food is good."}
{"text":"I was visiting Las Vegas for vacation with a friend.  When we got into our hotel on November 1, 2017, Sofia's Pizza menu was under our hotel door.  We ordered a pizza.  About an hour later the pizza arrived.  It was soggy and cold.  I called the store to pickup the pizza and return my money.  They refused to do any of this, advised me I had to speak to the manager (Kevin) and to call back the next day as he was not in.  I called several times the next day and left my contact information for Kevin.  Kevin supposedly never came in that next day and never returned any of my calls.   My recommendation to anyone...don't ever order from this place.  The food is poor quality along with their customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Late night order! Was doubtful of how the meal would be, but the menu was under the door and we were hungry!  We ordered wings and a Philly cheesesteak!  Fast, great food, great packaging and presentation!  All the condiments arrived.  Will prob order more wings during our stay... The Philly was spot on!"}
{"text":"The delivery was very good the food was perfect value for $ was good everything was hot and tasty.I will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Placed an order online and 30 minutes later the company that runs the site called us back to say they weren't answering their phones. Wth?"}
{"text":"They don't sell pizza by the slice, so I ordered an Italian sub instead.  Sadly, I neglected to refrain from putting mayo on it (which I shouldn't have to do, since an Italian sub should NEVER be made with mayo, but rather oil and vinegar on the bread).  The sub was ok, but the mayo really wrecked it.  It might have been great; maybe I'll give them another try some day.    Staff were friendly; it didn't take long to get my food (I was the only customer there).  The TV was off when I arrived, but they turned it on while I was waiting; apparently they thought I would enjoy seeing a meth-head get arrested on \"COPS\" while they made my lunch; I preferred \"off.\"  Seating consists of 3 formica booths that each seat 4 people; it seems like most of their business is take-out or delivery.  You *could* eat here, but the ambiance would hardly be charming."}
{"text":"I go here solely for the lamb gyros combo. My friends and cousins go here for the same reason. The inside has a very minimalistic design only containing 2 tables perfect for one on one conversations.  The inside has a pokeball paint design. I'm only writing random shit because yelp won't let me just say \"awesome gyros. Living with my ladies #live\""}
{"text":"Very rude... I called to ask a simple question. I asked the man on the phone, if he was the owner. His response was, \"If you're not ordering food, I don't have time for you.\" Then hung up."}
{"text":"No star should be given. Ordered a large pepperoni pizza, two large dinner salads and the sampler appetizers. Put order in at 8:15pm, was told it would be delivered in 45 minutes. We received the food @ 9:45pm. The pizza was cold with grease that had already started \"drying\" on top. Appetizer was placed on bottom of bag which made one of the salads warm. Appetizers were Luke warm, ordered 4 dressings for the salads, received 2 sour blue cheese dressings. Called immediately and was told to call in the morning. Called @ 10:00am like I was told (never was told to keep the food) of course manager was not in @ 10:00, was told to call back at 5:00pm. I had a plane to catch, so went in @ 1:45pm and was told they would only give me $10.00 back. WHAT? The gal told me \"what if we had to refund everyone\" again, WHAT? I paid $50.00 dollars for inedible food. The gal also said, we need to see the food. WHAT? It's in the garbage. Worst food ever and by far the worst customer service ever."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good, definitely one of the best in the area. Sometimes its a little greasy, and the mushrooms are canned, but good other than that. The service isn't the best though... We tried to use the Yelp coupon for 1 dollar off of every 10 spent, and they said they don't accept coupons. My total was $28, so it would have been 2 dollars. Good customer service says, give the small discount; but not them. Granted they did apologize, but by that point I was already thinking of somewhere new to try."}
{"text":"Came to this place from a recommendation from a friend. As soon as I walked in, I felt uncomfortable because it looked so dirty. We went up to the counter and waited for around 3 minutes until the woman acknowledged my husband and I even though she was sitting in front of us the whole time. She said our order would be done in 20 minutes. 35 minutes past and we finally got our order.  Pizza tastes like it was frozen and microwaved, not only that, but gave us both food poisoning!!! I will NEVER come back!!!"}
{"text":"We were in search of a quick pizza fix (for our little guy) late last night and this hit the spot.  Relatively near the strip and the pick up specials are inexpensive.  XL pepperoni for $6.95.  Since the little guy prefers cheese (who doesn't), we went with half cheese half pepperoni.  To our surprise, the pizza was very good.  We've had NY style pizza in NYC and this comes very close.  Just love the soft (semi-doughy) crust.  Our little guy had two slices."}
{"text":"Found this place via Yelp search after a long day at work, no lunch break, and a killer wing craving- unfortunately, the wings offered here are not buffalo style, as I assume when ordering wings at a pizza place.  Order of wings for one comes with a side of fries (option for regular, curly, or upgrade to onion rings) containing 8-10 pieces per their website. Sauce options are medium, mild, hot, and bbq. The \"hot\" wings are  sauced prior to baking, and overcooked to the point of being dry, sauce itself seems to be sriarcha-based and includes red pepper flakes- a combination I've never seen or heard of on wings. Unpleasant at best, ended up tossing half the order despite my hunger.  Curly fries were decent- then again, they were my only option. Ample portion, would prefer ketchup packets to the weird shot glass of ketchup I actually received, but an order of fries won't make me a repeat visitor.  Location is small but decently clean, cashier was polite. Group of smokers on the patio made for an unpleasant smoke odor- may have been employees as one of the group got up, entered the dining room, went behind the counter and removed a bottled beverage from the cooler, then went outside to drink it, without saying a word to me as I waited to pick up my order. \"Bizarre\" describes both the location and the wings."}
{"text":"I accidentally ordered from this Sophia's, thinking it was the Sofia's located on Arville (different restaurant, different owner, see review). That was a mistake and we were beyond disappointed.   The driver showed up late with our pizza & other items. We paid with credit card (thankfully), tipped, and they left. Well, when we opened the pizza after the driver left, all of the toppings had slid to one side and there were only three slices that we could eat.  So we call the restaurant and they were super rude, the person on the phone even denied it. How could they even know?  We went back and forth with 2 phone conversations, and offered to text pictures of the mess they delivered. The restaurant offered to give us a discount on our next order. This resolution wasn't nearly good enough, as were hungry and there were literally 3 slices with all of the toppings on them, the rest just saucy crust. Not only that, but it's presumptuous to think they earned our business after this mess - the pizza topping mess is occasionally expected, the bad customer service is never okay.   Finally, we said they could charge for the rest of the order, but we weren't willing to pay for the pizza. If they didn't agree with this resolution we would dispute the entire cc charge and send pics for them to decide. Well, they must have agreed bc we were charged for the other items ordered + tip (although undeserving), but not the pizza.   Bottom line: they have terrible customer service. And the little bit of pizza we were able to eat wasn't even good. I will never order from here again. I noticed the review regarding change in ownership, but I'm not even sure I would consider that worthy enough to try them again. There's other better pizza joints in town that care about food quality and customer service."}
{"text":"I always get the couch potato special good deal. 9/10 it is perfect. Today the forgot my fries, but the food was so good I didn't even mind but they were missed. Med sized wings and fingers that aren't over priced. The pizza was nicely made as well. Highly recommended couch potato but I haven't tried anything else. They also have this dessert with powdered sugar and fried dough that are a mix between crack and doughnuts lol"}
{"text":"Its was good,  a little oily for my taste but not too bad the wings and fingers are always bonb"}
{"text":"Vegan here, checking in. Best specialty pizza is belissma and i order it no cheese. Not too oily, always amazing."}
{"text":"Sign says 24hrs... Door hrs say till midnight... Stopped by around 11pm... Lights on, guy behind the counter... Door locked & totally ignored."}
{"text":"This is a great pizza. Their Chicago Pizza is excellent. Their customer service is great and you won't find a pizza like their's anywhere else in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time and could have had a better experience. I give 2 stars because they sent me a tuna sandwich instead of turkey, not to mention the sandwich was very soggy. I called and complained and was told to hold, all to listen to the cook get grilled on why and how he could make such a mistake. I thought that was unprofessional. I was told they would  remake my sandwich and send it out to me. Ended up getting the sandwich an hour later and it was soggy. My son loved his chicken parm and my husband said the philly was ok not the best but edible. We also had the curly fries, which were so disgusting. Dry and no taste. I will not order here again. Waste of $ 40.00."}
{"text":"Delivery guy was awesome even though he looked like he should be retired. Called them because we thought that it was a cheese pizza and the tag said medium even though we ordered a large. The guy who answered began yelling at me saying that he gave us an extra large and that they put the pepperoni under the cheese to reduce the grease. The pizza was swimming in grease and I told him that I didn't know about the pepperoni and that he shouldn't yell at his customers when they were just asking for clarification. I asked to speak to the manager and he said that was him. Terrible customer service.  I will never order from here again."}
{"text":"The worst walk-in pizza experience I've ever witnessed in my 42 years of life. No exaggeration. So unbelievably bad that I basically just shut down (mentally) in the process.   Lunchtime. Weekday. Around 1:30ish. Day of this review. Saw this place as I was driving by so I decided to check it out. After all, I felt like some pizza.  First thing I noticed as I walked in was how HOT the damn place was inside. A/C must have been down (or maybe they were too cheap to have it on), but it wasn't a deal breaker. Little did I know, this was the brightest, biggest red flag that was ever waved in my face, and I completely ignored it.  Walked up to the counter, trashy woman appears from out of the kitchen area (so trashy, you noticed it at first glance). She doesn't greet me, doesn't say a word, just stands there looking at me with a dumb look on her face. Finally, I say: \"Do you guys have pizza by-the-slice?\" She replies: \"No\" in the most monotone voice ever. At this point, I'm looking at the menu and she doesn't offer any other alternatives. At this point I should have my head examined for not walking out.   Long story short, I ended up ordering a calzone and a drink. For the \"drink\", she gives me a can of soda (no ice, no cup) and tells me \"20 minutes\". Okay, maybe the place didn't have cups or ice, but you'd think someone with half a brain would wait to give you the drink AFTER or at least ask. I shut down in disbelief.  I have a seat and I start to realize just how hot the place actually is now that I've settled. It's VERY uncomfortable. So I'm sweating my Filipino ass off as I'm sitting there with my unopened can of root beer and thinking \"I should get my money back?\" But something deep inside is keeping me from having to ever exchange a single word with the trashy woman ever again. I decide to avoid interaction at all costs. Also, it was a card transaction, so that wouldn't be a cash refund, which meant, a few words of exchange. Remember, I'm in shut down mode.  And just when you think it couldn't have gotten any worse...  Trashy woman BLOWS HER F*CKING NOSE right at the counter. Loud, too!!! I couldn't make this sh*t up. At this very minute, I think I'm in some trailer trash nightmare that I can't awake from. It's surreal. Like, I'm in a comedy sketch or something. I was waiting for someone to say \"Hey, Jeff. You see those cameras over there? You've been Punk'D!\". But that wasn't the case. I shut down even more.  20 minutes later she hands me my order. No napkins. No condiments. Took it back to work. Ate a couple of bites and threw it away. Couldn't. Lost my appetite. Lost faith in mankind. Boy are we in trouble.   I forgot to mention, while all this was going on, her 7-year-old daughter (I feel sorry for her because she's going to grow up just like her trashy mom) is sitting in the damn dining area watching Youtube videos (loud) or something; not really a big del, babysitters/dare care cost a lot, I get it; but in the context of everything that happened, it definitely doesn't help.   I'm usually vocal about customer service and speaking/standing up for myself, but as I've mentioned several times, this unfortunate series of events just shut down my psyche. The chemical reaction in my body went to \"sleep mode\", rather than, I don't know.... uh... murder?   Anyways, if someone, anyone, the owner, the managers, someone who is not trashy, is reading this, you might want to add a dollar to whatever hourly wage you're giving these trashy people you hire.  I'll tell you this: Every opportunity I get, I will go out of my way to ensure that everyone knows that there's most likely snot from the scummy people you hired. You guys have no standards.  I will NEVER come here again, I don't care about how many locations this \"organization\" has.   You should be ashamed of yourself. Keep my money. There's no way I'm taking this review off Yelp.  P.S. The place smelled like fetus sh*t too. Forgot to mention that little detail. Screw you YELP for not giving me the option to choose ZERO stars."}
{"text":"I wish I would have read the reviews before my boyfriend and I placed our order through them.  We ordered our pizza around 6:00pm and it didn't get delivered until around 7:40pm. I don't see a reason for a pizza and some wings to take well over an hour. When our food finally arrived it was cold and had a terrible taste. We called for a refund and our driver was out of the area but the lady at the store said that when he was back in our area then she would call him. We just called back at the pizza store and the lady who was working there said that we would not be getting our money back at all and that she never had any intentions of giving us our money back. Don't go here this place is in it for the money. Terrible place.  I wouldn't recommend this place to ANYONE."}
{"text":"Please don't waste your time. The pizza here is not as good as others in the area. The pizza arrived and all of the toppings had slid off. The taste was bland and they were stingy with the Parm cheese."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! The customer service that my family and I received was amazing. The food was delicious. After we had gotten our food, we got a call from the company asking us how everything was even after their obligations were over and it was a shock. You don't get customer service like that anymore."}
{"text":"I read so many bad reviews but still gave it a go! Turns out to be new owners. (Which we met. The wife was super sweet) We ordered hot buffalo wings and the chicken pasta to-go. The wings were delicious. Well cooked! The pasta was also delicious! Definitely will be coming back! Our order was out very quickly even though they were really busy! We were so hungry we forgot to take a Picture"}
{"text":"My friend at work had ordered the wings and I tried one and loved it, so that same night I ordered wings to go and brought them home. To my surprise when I got home my wings has NO SAUCE on them and considering it's about a fifteen minute drive from my house to them I didn't go back to have it fixed.   I will give them one more chance, but super disappointed because I had my heart set on some delicious wings tonight after a long day at work."}
{"text":"Waited almost 2 hours for our food, had to call and see what was going on with our order, finally called a second time to cancel my order and the guy over the phone wanted to argue about their cancellation policy. I haven't had the opportunity to taste their pizza and now after this experience I probably never will"}
{"text":"Oh boy, where to start.  I decided to call to get food brought to my job. I had ordered from Sofia's pizza before, and had always enjoyed the food. I wasn't sure the number on the flyer was good anymore, as one of the numbers hadn't worked last time I called, so I went to the site on the flyer, figuring it was a safe bet. There was only one number on the site, which I called as the menu was a bit different then I remembered when I looked at the site. I figured I could get some answers about the food. This guy picks up, and I can just hear him. I don't know if it was a bad connection, but the guy sounded like he was half asleep, and I kept hearing a squeaky noise I now think was him. I give him the adress and he says he doesn't know if he will be able to deliver, and if I called the other location. \" No... I only saw one number\" so he says he will see. \" I can call the other one if its too far.\" \"No, No, don't do that, thats fine\" so I hear shuffling around. Weird. So what I was trying to order for myself and a coworker was a bucket of fries, a double bacon cheese burger, and a double mushroom cheese burger.  He mumbles and I hear that occasional squeek noise. \"so you want a normal burger with mushrooms?\". uhm, no, I wanted a double mushroom cheese burger.  So long silence. Then he asks if I will be paying with cash or card. Cash.  He then tells me \" Your total will be $29.*mumble*, for a double bacon cheese burger, a mushroom burger, and large fries\". This caught me off guard. I was expecting a little over $20 with tax and delivery. But nearly $30?  Besides the fact something just seemed off. I said we will be cancling, and just said \"Alright\" before we got off the phone.  The more we thought about it, the odder it got. So we looked online, and discovered despite the name, site and logo, it was not the same one.  This place is over priced, and whoever was on the phone just seemed so very weird. I will not be ordering."}
{"text":"This is a small eatery with decent pizza. It's not the best, but it's not the worst.   It's not worth it to order many toppings, because you'll get the same amount on your pizza as their 4 item version, just with more variety. I've had both. You're paying a lot more for a sporatic splash of toppings. I recommend 4 or less. Lesson learned.  Service is ok. Not overly-friendly, efficient or attentive. In fact I took all those photos before I was even greeted.   It's something different... And for that reason, I'll go back."}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas decided pizza sounded good ordered the extra large from Sophia's it took them almost 2 hours to get it to us and they told us an hour and when it got here it was cold and I had never tasted such a disgusting Pizza in my life we threw the whole thing out."}
{"text":"Only reason I gave this restaurant even one star is because I had to. You should definitely  eat if you want your order after an hour and a half, it's super cold and lousy, and they didn't give you things you ordered. Also they will call you a liar when you call to talk to them about their mistakes. I must say its the worst pizza place in Las Vegas. Rude and horrible customer service. I find it very disgusting on they way they run a business."}
{"text":"Extremely rude and very unprofessional why do they have somebody when answering the phone that has absolutely no customer service skills and English if you want to call it that it's horrible stay away from this place because you never know what they might be doing to your food I've given this place many tries and the benefit of the doubt but enough is enough 1 star is all they get so if you do choose to eat at this place do so with caution"}
{"text":"Apparently this pizza shop that I've been ordering from never had a problem in 10yrs, thinks it's OK to insult my parents,my household, and myself. I let them slide on a 66$ order about 2weeks ago(was told next time I'd get a discount instead of sending the food back), then 3nights ago they messed up my food for the second time iñ a row. I called back all the lady wanted to do was argue and insult, instead of handling business. I'm sitting here with they're food untouched still, I talked with the owner just now, he just wanted to argue. So now we're waiting till tomorrow,the owner says he's coming to get the food and give me a refund tomorrow. I know better than to mess with the people that prepare your food, but 2times in a row is unreal. What a shame, that this place treats anyone like this, especially a 10yr customer. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE IS MY QUOTE. I ORDERED FROM SICILY'S PIZZA THE SAME NIGHT, WAS GIVEN MORE THAT RESPECT. SAY NO TO SOPHIA'S PIZZA, THEY MIGHT INSULT YOUR WHOLE LIFE.   THANKS A BUNCH!"}
{"text":"Old owners are gone!! The original owners of the place are back and it's very noticeable. The person I talked to on the phone to place my order was young and upbeat, our large pizzas were delivered quickly and the delivery guy was nice! I will be ordering again; cannot stress enough how glad I am the original owners are back..."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for sub sandwich and jalapeno poppers, when giving my order I have them all info down to bldg number, what floor and room... waited over a hour finally called was told the driver went back because he couldn't find my room asked why they didn't go to front desk and have them call my room he said he tried to call my phone number I gave and didn't answer but I know for a fact they never asked for a contact number. Very unprofessional, don't waste your time ordering from them!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible place. One of my individual's ordered food from here for delivery. About 3 Hours later he informed me that his food hadn't come. I called the place and the person who answered the phone said the chef didn't receive his order and it hadn't even been made yet. I asked for the manager's name because she wasn't there and he refused to give it to me. I sent them an email on their website and I never got a response. My poor guy was waiting for hours and by then time his food got here he had already missed his lunch."}
{"text":"pretty good pizza place. the $20 special comes with a large two topping, half a bucket of fingers and fries. food is decent enough for me to order every once in a while cuz the price is so good. id give it 4 stars if it wasnt for the guy who answers the phone all the time. he always seems angry and impatient when trying to take your order."}
{"text":"This place lives three minutes from me and I waited an hour and a half to have a personal pizza delivered to me. It was cold and stale by the time it reached me. I had high hopes since I always used to go to the Lamb location. I wont be buying from here again."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever hands down!! I've been coming here for pizza for over 5 years now and not once has it been bad. It taste just as amazing every time. If you're near it and want a really good slice of pizza I highly recommend this place! Plus it's hella cheap and they have more than just pizza."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. Super cheap food for poor quality. Wasnt horrible but wasn't great. The pizza was pretty good but the mozzarella sticks were disgusting and soggy."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery with low expectations, as the reviews aren't great. Pleasantly surprised...it came early and still hot! Quite good I must say!! Ordered the combo appetizer, double mushroom burger and philly cheesesteak.  I will definitely order from here again"}
{"text":"Wanted to try Sofia's because it's so close to home. We Ordered cheesesteaks shrimp fettuccine Alfredo and fries. The portions are awesome and very filling. The flavor in the cheesesteaks was great. The pasta came with garlic bread and salad. The delivery time was good ordered and had it to me in about 40 minutes. I will definitely be ordering from here more often ."}
{"text":"The pizza isn't bad - but nothing to write home about. The sauce tastes like a mix of canned tomato sauce and some additional seasoning. Use either fresh Romano, or at least canned whole tomatoes, to create your own sauce. The base cheese is mostly mozz - could benefit from a 50/35/10/5 mix of mozz, jack, white cheddar and grated parmesan. There is no topping cheese mix - any of a combo of Parmesan/Romano etc, would work. I ordered on Grubhub  - the half-bucket of wings is advertised as 16-20 pieces. I got exactly 16 pieces - which is, what I expect, is the norm. If you are going to offer a \"Half-Bucket\", then be specific in the number of wings you are delivering. You're good - not great."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken wings and received all bloody chicken legs not even One Wing and could die of salmonella poisoning! When I called to complain and explain the lady on the phone all of a sudden couldn't speak English! The health department needs to be aware of what they're serving late at night. Also we ordered pizza and it was supposed to be a pick up special and there was no cheese on the pizza just dried up sauce!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  Great food, hot and the orders are filled correctly. The customer service is sketchy sometimes, but I believe that is due to the language barrier and not rudeness."}
{"text":"Customer service was very pleasant, young lady who took my phone order was very nice and in person was nice as well.  Ordered the \"Sofia\" and since I am a fan of Italian and New York  pizzas I base all my pizza reviews on those styles.  First the pizza looked ok and they did not skimp on the toppings,  the first bite tasted ok until I started getting into the ground beef and Italian sausage which tasted like meat substitutes.  The vegetables were cut so unevenly the their texture ranged from raw to overcooked.  The crust was a good vessel and stood up to all the toppings and cheese but was extremely bland.  The sauce was average and fairly acidic.  When canned mushrooms work I am a fan, and these canned mushrooms worked in fact if I ordered this pizza without ground meat toppings this combination pizza the  \"Sofia\" would have been good but it's just ok."}
{"text":"I am a grave yard bartender and have ordered from them in the past with no problem but today I call for delivery and they tell me that they don't deliver to my location.  I could understand if they said they were busy tonight and couldn't make it but to lie and say they don't deliver to my bar really irritates me.  I have ordered multiple times but will be throwing their menus away at my bar.  Lots of customers that would order but now I will send my customers to another business.  Thumbs down on this place."}
{"text":"This place sucks sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!! They always mess up our order!!!! We are done trying to understand their mistakes!! And if you call the employees are always ass holes!!! So rude and so disrespectful! Will not ever order from them!!! The customer service is shit ! They can't fallow simple instructions!!!! This place sucks DO NOT ORDER !!! They will messed something up and say it's your fault!!! Worst service ever!!!!! Don't even deserve one star they deserve to be closed or get a whole new customer service staff! Because the one they have now it's gonna put them out of business!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered a pepperoni and mushroom pizza and they delivered a onion, sausage and pepperoni pizza that looked like road kill. I'm extremely pissed off cause I ordered pizza for my kids and it's not what they wanted. The taste of the pizza taste like stale ASS and the crust was hard like cement. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE. We spent $31 cause we got a few other things. NEVER EVER EVER EVER AGAIN ORDERING FROM HERE AGAIN.  I WOULD GIVE THIS PLACE 0 STARS IF IT LET ME."}
{"text":"Ordered the calamari and a buffalo chicken pizza with no onions and paid an extra fee for a side of ranch. The calamari was so over cooked that I couldn't chew through it and the pizza had a lot of onions... and they forgot our ranch. Not worth the $44. And don't say you have coke products if you carry pepsi ..."}
{"text":"Yummy and HUGE calzone(fresh basil). Good marinara dipping sauce. Double cheeseburger tasty as well."}
{"text":"lady on the phone was super rude and unpleasant. We ordered beef short rib dinner The coleslaw consisted of green slop. It tasted HORRIBLE! It smelled and tasted rancid. I've never had coleslaw quite as TERRIBLE as the one from this place. The baked beans smelled and looked like pork and beans from a can. We also ordered a small pizza. The lady on the phone said it would take 20mins for delivery. It took a whole hour for the food to be delivered. When we open the pizza box. There is no pizza only ribs. So we call back because they forgot our pizza. First and last time we are ordering from this place. So disappointed! Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"only really found one thing on the menu I like which is the wings medium heat. everything else Ive tried really wasnt too appealing but for some reason i always order lol. Look its open 24 hours and for that I cant complain."}
{"text":"Gave this place a second try. Once again, the delivery was extra fast and the garlic bread was great. However, the ravioli was just your basic square ravioli you could get at the grocery store. The sauce was good but nothing special. The meatballs were good. The salad was okay but it was covered with about three fourths of an inch of mozzarella cheese packed down on it which I thought was strange. I ordered the chocolate cake, but instead received a piece of chocolate cream pie which I don't like. I probably won't be ordering from them again, which is a shame because the prices are good and the delivery is good."}
{"text":"Okay i ordered here today and i waited 2 hours and when the food finally got here i got the burger and the macaroni salad right but drinks are in cans when i oredered 2 liters and tiramisu was still frozen! It was just disgusting i just had to eat it i had no choice, i dont want to waste food."}
{"text":"The driver needs to be fired, He is moving too fast he might be on drugs . I tried to pay him with my card for the order of two double bacon cheese burgers with two buckets of fries ... He accidentally gave me someone's else's order which was a pizza . I gave it back and he didn't even take my card so an hour later I get three voicemails left in my phone . One voicemail he's demanding I open up my door over $8 , The other messages you hear him speeding driving in his car he forgot to end the call . I'm shaking my head at this point because I'm not even home anymore I'm at the movies with my boyfriend and I have to leave out the movie to see why I keep getting missed calls from Sofias pizza . I feel upset because I'm a loyal customer and this is clearly not good customer service . I called back and provided my card number over the phone with the older gentlemen who told me he did not have the manager there but I knew he was lying you are the manager he's the only one that answers the phone . That's like insulting my intelligence !!! He said he would have the manager contact me regarding the driver ... Just fire the driver he's the worst ... I will be taking my business somewhere else goodbye Sofias"}
{"text":"So I kinda dont wanna write this review because this has become one of my favorite places to go..not for pizza...but their awesome burgers.  Im afraid they will change something if too many people know...but oh well.  Ive never tried the pizza, but the burgers are huge and flavorful with a toasted bun, steak fries, and super yummy toppings for under $8.  Delivery is fast and friendly.  A every so often indulgence for sure."}
{"text":"I get the xl 1 topping for $7.50 and am always pleased. Very thin crust like I like, with just enough cheese and a decent sauce. I haven't had any problems with the service. I order, I pay, they make my food, I go home. The sign says 24hrs, but they close at 12mid."}
{"text":"Meh, is right on this review. Girl and I ordered pizza from here for delivery.  We asked for marinara on the side. We received cold tomato sauce from a can. Cheese Pizza was just average. I am thankful they were 24hrs. and close but I would not recommend this place at this time based on \"MY\" quality taste test. Villa's rocks!"}
{"text":"When in Las Vegas places and order for delivery.  About an hour later the driver calls and says to meet him downstairs. We go downstairs and the driver had set the food next to the trash can, as soon as I gave him a tip and was ready to take off. I asked if they brought us the plates we requested and he said they may be in there and just ran off. Bad service from the driver, I would not order again. Here for 10 days and definitely not ordering again. Also I must say, a bit over priced for pizza."}
{"text":"I guess I got what I paid for... Very mediocre at BEST. Ordered for delivery because it was cheaper than the hotel room service I got the calamari and fries, they were terrible at best ; the chicken Alfredo was ok at best; the app combo was gross at best; and the spaghetti and meatballs were good. I do not recommend the fried food it was all gross . Just order real room service and save a sour stomach. Ew."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! Ordered a pizza with extra cheese NO extra cheese, but had hair baked into the pizza!! We threw the pizza out, they wanted us to return the pizza. Who wants a new pizza after that?! The order taker also cussed me out when I told her the customer service was terrible. We only wanted a partial refund because I mean really who wants to eat there again. Stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened, this place has gone down hill. It took 90 minutes for them deliver food. WTF!  Football is over and Nascar hadn't started yet!  Food cold and lousy.  Called to complain ánd the employes kept passing rapping the phone.  Not very professional.   Sorry folks I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service! I ordered pizza from Grubhub.com to pick it up from this place. 1st of all, they cancelled my order because it was a cash only transaction. So, i called them saying it wasnt and they said \"Ok we will get it ready for you then\" so i waited and waited for another hour I called and they told me that there was no order for me there. So i told them i did place an ordee an hour ago and they told me to fax the a receipt? This bitch of a little girl \"Elena\" told me that i have no business with them if i dont have a receipt. Like how the fuck am i going to have a receipt when i didnt get the pizza?! Then she had the audacity to say that this was a prank call and i was a liar? Excuse me miss fetus? Sorry that you're having a shitty day but you have no right to assume that! I called them back and i ask to have the manager number to file a complaint but they said they didnt have no supervisor nor a manager on duty. How are you running this business?  If anything that place is a joke and full of workers that doesn't give a rats ass about anything or anyone. I've been reading the reviews previously and it was completely horrid! DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE. If you want stomach poisoning due to undercooking, horrible customer service, and fetuses making your food then this is the place to be! Before i end this \"review\" i just want to say Fuck you Sofia's Pizza! You're going out of business soon. Mark my words you assholes. Something is coming your way to shut that place down."}
{"text":"Great pizza, friendly staff, fair prices, clean store, open 24/7? What else could you ask for. I've been here on multiple occasions, both pick up and delivery. Everyone has always been kind and courteous and the food is DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"Have gotten food from here before and it was decent. Tonight was NOT the case... chicken fingers were limp and soggy. Cold sub was horrible! Ordered Turkey BLT... got bologna and cheese with onions and extra mayo. Staff refused to make it right. Thank God for Yelp24!!!  Curly fries were decent... that is about it. Buyer beware."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and the food is BOMB!  Check it out~"}
{"text":"When you walk in, be prepared for a mysterious odor.  Closest way to describe it is \"rotten\" egg smell.  And it wasn't an isolated time.  Been in twice over a two month period.  Still smells.  You decide.  But I'd avoid it until they get rid of it."}
{"text":"You better make sure you talk to some one before you order on line. They took my order, but never delivered. Nor will they answer the phone, or reply to email contact. I will never use them again."}
{"text":"3rd time in a row they messed up my order! And offer no solution my management not here now! A complete joke and food going down hill as well as service obviously! Not good!"}
{"text":"Definitely going to order here again. Great value when you order off the specials. I love their chicken strips, they're soooo huge and yummy! The pizza was pretty decent as well. Wings are good and of great value, too. I like that it's crispy and doesn't feel like the slimy boiled wings from most other pizza joints.  I thought I wasn't going to like the pizza because the pepperoni was at the bottom, but you get to taste the cheese better this way. Delivery was very quick and the customer service over the phone was excellent. I actually didn't like the french fries that much, so it helps to crisp it up in the oven (they're more like soft potato wedges but you get tons of them)."}
{"text":"New Year's Eve in Vegas! Wow they were busy but the service was great. The pizza was fantastic as well as burger and ravioli. They delivered within the hour which is long but considering New Year's Eve it was fast. Some pizza places were 1 1/2 hours. Will order again if in area."}
{"text":"Pizza was very good, loved the flavor of the sauce and just the right amount of cheese and toppings.  Got the carry out special which you can't beat for a 16 inch cheese for $5.99! We got Canadian bacon and bacon. The bacon was thick and crispy yum!!  The person that I assume is the owner that helped me had a kinda gruff personality but I did here him making jokes with another customer so maybe just my perception.  Overall I liked the pizza and will return again."}
{"text":"Arrived at our hotel tonite, and there was a flyer for Sofia's sitting there. It was late, and we were hungry, so figured we'd give it a try. Overall, cheap, but not so good. Actually. The pizza wasn't bad - ordered a 14\" two-topping (sausage and mushroom) and it wasn't spectacular, but it was fine. The pastas, on the other hand were mushy and flavorless - both the 2 orders of shrimp scampi we ordered, and the one order of spaghetti and meatballs weren't very good. The Philly steak sandwich was just ok, too.  Bottom line - go ahead and order a pizza, but I'd bypass the rest."}
{"text":"Ok...so called this place at 6pm...just now got my flipping pizza!! Its now 8:15!!! The pizza isn't any thing that great either...crust boring...just very 'ok' pizza..definitely not worth $21 & a 2 hr wait!! Plus they forgot our side of ranch!!"}
{"text":"Well I can't really comment on their food or their service.  We decided to order from them one evening but the guy told us it would take over an hour and he sounded like we were really inconveniencing him. So we told him to forget about it.  I don't mind waiting over an hour but I'd like a little courtesy over the phone."}
{"text":"I decided to try Sofia Pizza after being disappointed with the chain pizza restaurants near my house. When I lived on the Eastside I was a regular at the Sophia's on Charleston so I was excited to try this one. I was DISAPPOINTED.  We ordered a number 7 special. It came with two 18' pizzas and twenty wings. I requested extra crispy wings. The wings were barley cooked through. The pizza sauce had good flavor however the crust didn't rise correctly, there was barley any toppings and the cheese was no existent.   We won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Anyone who gave this place even one star, has to be the owner or a relative!!! Worst food ever!!!! We took one bite(cheese steak and hamburger- they gave use the wrong burger on top of that!!) HORRIBLE, and through it out!!! Nasty taste, cheap hamburgers, no meat on cheese steak and had a horrible taste-"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for delivery.  It came half an hour after the end of the given window and was cold by the time it got here.  It was on the thin side but the onions were the perfect flavor and softness."}
{"text":"Four stars for sofias pizza. Was in between appointments and wanted to get something to eat close by. It's true that their customer service has alot of room for improvement, however the pizza was delicious and very affordable. I had never been here before, and there is a sticker on the window for two slices and a soda for $3.99. What a deal! Unfortunately this only applies to cheese pizza slices, but he agreed to give us \"sofias\" slices for an upcharge. Still a great deal. They have an unusually vast and large selection of menu items, I stuck to the pizza and it was very good."}
{"text":"Absolutely atrocious.  Food was terrible. Service was terrible. Management IS terrible.  If I could give a negative rating, I most certainly would. This place, this owner/manager should get out of the business because they are overwhelmed and incompetent."}
{"text":"We had the pizza delivered to us, we were in vacation. My husband had the exact amount of change for the pizza and he had a tip that he was going to give the guy. My husband did not get the chance to give the delivery guy the tip, because by the time he gave him the money for the pizza the guy got upset and threw the change on the pizza and left. My husband called the place and the person whom he spoke with was concerned about the situation, however we do not have a way of knowing if that person will treat the next person the same way or not.  Otherwise the pizza was OK."}
{"text":"Ordered food from this place, got it 2 hours later cold and burnt. Tried to to get my money back and couldn't because the owner was very rude and called me a liar. Horrible costumer service i have ever had. The owner was super desrespectful and poor costumer service. And started screaming at us."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The people are so rude. We placed an order online and didn't get any sort or receipt. After calling they were short with us saying \"yea we have it you'll get it.\" After waiting almost an hour we called back to try an get a time reference. The person on the other end was short an said they were leaving in a few minutes. 20 minutes later we had the delivery and the person at the door yelled about how she had to wonder around to try and find the building and next time to put the information in better. We opened the box and not only was the pizza wrong it was cold. We won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Seriously? WOW!   I love small pizzeria and pasta houses. I'm not one to go to your generic over priced chain pizza place with terrible sauce and over loaded fake cheese.   Since I've moved to Vegas I've had a hard time finding my pizza spot, and tonight I found it! I am the type to spend a little extra to insure I get a top quality pie, and I didn't have to here, in fact I spent less than I normally would at any other chain pizza place. Their deals are ridiculous for how amazing the food is!   Before I jump ahead to the flavors of everything I want to say how amazingly charming and sweet the woman on the phone was from the second I called, now for a new place I'm a pretty difficult person to handle on the phone because I can be so indecisive. She was knowledgeable about everything they had on their online menu and what she didn't know she personally asked the chef, right on the spot, so I had immediate answers. When I walked in, already shocked at the insanely low price of the food, I was greeted by a very real man, who had obviously prepared my food, they both made me feel like I was walking into a family members kitchen and they were going to make this pregnant belly the happiest it's been in days! Love them! Loved their down to earth real ness and honesty, amazing people, and this is coming from someone who works in the industry.  Now let me got to this food! I personally have worked for quite a few pizzerias and pasta houses all over California, and I have a father-in-law who is straight from Milano. I'm very picky and very skeptical of others Italian based foods.   I ordered the sausage and meatball lasagna as well as an 18\" pie, half pepperoni and half mushrooms. I dished up some lasagna for my mom and I. Excitingly I licked the spoon, and \"WOW\" was all I could say. The sauce was insane, blew my mind! The flavor made me feel like Nona (Italian word for grandma) sat me down and saved my life. I wanted to inhale that lasagna, but I couldn't because every bite was worth enjoying, and I did, I enjoyed every last bite! The pizza was brilliant, and herby base flavor in the sauce that popped like fireworks in my mouth, not at all over cheesed but cheesy enough to satisfy my taste buds, and the pepperoni finally fulfilled my preggo craving. I will be back as much as I can possibly convince my other half to eat pizza."}
{"text":"Just got Sofia pizza I was just wondering if they change the recipe the pizza just doesn't taste good anymore it was one of my best pizza in town but now it just taste awful"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try, ordered a philly cheese steak sandwich made it a combo with fries and a drink. Paid $23 with delivery charge, about a 35 minute wait not to bad. Food arrived nice and warm, philly was a good size, the only thing I didn't like much was the bell peppers were a little hard they could've been cooked much longer in my opinion and my fries were soggy not crisp at all. Besides that food was good."}
{"text":"On vacation in Las Vegas. Flyer was left at our resort and showed they offer delivery. Called to order Philly cheesesteak, and side of onions. Also got medium chicken pizza.   The delivery took about an hour... No problem there but once we dug into the pizza it was the most tasteless bland pizza ever. Only thing on it was sauce, cheese, mushrooms, chicken and tomatoes. The menu showed zucchini but it was mia.   The onion rings were cold as if they were made in the microwave and not fried. Would not recommend this place for any future resort residents."}
{"text":"I'm new to Vegas and had recently decided to try this place out.  I ordered the chicken fingers.  It was so on point!  Tonight I decided to order from them again.  I placed an order via their website.  I got an email confirmation, the date was incorrect.  It was dated for tomorrow 10/18.  At the bottom it says \"if you have any questions about your order, reply to this email.\"  I replied to the email wanting confirmation that they knew my order was for tonight and NOT for tomorrow, 10/18.  Turns out that those instructions were incorrect as they don't have a customer service email setup, as my email came back as \"undeliverable\".  So then I decided to call them, I've now called them 26 times and no one is picking up! The mailbox for the phone is full so I can't even leave a voicemail message.  Incredibly disappointed at how this business is operating. I will never order from them again and will be sure to tell people and other businesses to not order from them."}
{"text":"We arrived in Vegas at night after a hellacious 2 day struggle from Washington that left us beyond maxed out on stress, sleep deprivation, and nerves so rocked that no one had been able to stomach much food since beginning our trek here (Thanks Uhaul for that nightmare!) Utterly grateful to be in our room in one piece and finally here, we ordered up the family special from Sophia's.  Pepperoni pizza, garlic balls, hot wings (mild) and a 2 liter of Pepsi. It took just over an hour before our driver made it with the food, we called 5 minutes before delivery and could hear that they seemed quite busy,  but the lady on the phone was able to tell us he would be there in 5 minutes.  She was spot on. He showed up, was exceptionally friendly,  apologized for the wait, and welcomed us to Vegas.  We tore into our food the second the door latched and ate until we couldn't hold another bite. The pizza was good, the garlic balls were flavorful and buttery and the wings were spicy without being covered in a ton of sauce. I appreciated this so much because it kept the skin crispy. My daughter tore the wings UP! I have never seen her eat that many in one sitting, so definitely a win! We were completely pleased with our experience, save the tiny extra wait. The value from the special really made it worth doing again! Less than $30 and best meal we had in days!"}
{"text":"And again this place always rocks it fast service and fresh hot pizza thanks again keep doing what you are doing"}
{"text":"Great burgers! Ordered tru eat 24, food came in  pretty fast and driver followed all the instruction. Would order again."}
{"text":"Fast delivery and extremely hot food. Ordered pizza, wings and a salad, and everything looked and tasted good. Would order again for sure! And they are open 24/7 which is awesome!"}
{"text":"Ordered pasta and salad and the salad didn't make it to me.  When I called back in the \"chief\" got on the phone to tell me I was a \"lying\". I was shocked! He finally said he would send my salad back... and an hour later I called back to check on my salad... I was told \"if\" they got a driver free they would send it. Absolutely the worst customer service ever!"}
{"text":"After looking for good pizza places to try, we settled on this one. My kids were tired of big chain places so we thought we'd go small. We got a large pepperoni and sausage and a large chicken. Not thrilled about the chicken but the pepperoni and sausage is pretty good. The guy who delivered it and the guy who took my order were really nice. I'd recommend this place. Plus they is thin crust, my favorite!"}
{"text":"I came in tonight, it was my first night actually coming to this location. I don't know if the guy is the owner but he was incredibly rude. He had an attitude. I payed for 2 extra ranches with my order and didn't get them when I went back to claim them he basically said I was lying because he said they put them in the bag. Well excuse me but I don't lie. We only got 2 ranches and the ones the driver gave me completed the other ranches I had paid for."}
{"text":"Bad service, overpriced and pizza is okay, nothing special.   I would much rather go to Little Ceasers or Dominos.  The guy in charge, the owner I assume, is very rude."}
{"text":"the male who picks up the phone is not the friendliest over the phone or when you arrive to get your order, but; they've got what it takes to bake you a GREAT PIZZA & Not to mention their chicken wings!!!"}
{"text":"I'm impressed with the quality of the food- so delicious! The woman that answered the phone let me know I didn't add my topping for the pizza (ordered on grubhub) and was kind enough to give us plates, forks and knives since we just moved into our new home. Every single thing we ordered was absolutely delicious. She even added water after I ordered since our house was empty!!! Kindless goes a long way with me... You have found yourself a loyal customer. Thanks for making our first night in Vegas great!  Ps- the person that dropped off the food was also very sweet!!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza !!! Very tasty and oven fresh . The best pizza in town. I m not fan of pizza but love this place .  Come back for sure ."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped in on our way back into Town and the food hit the spot! All the ingredients were fresh and made to our specifications.  The crust is especially  good.  This is one of the best pizza's I have had.  Reminds me of Italy, Its filling but doest not weigh you down, lots of fresh toppings but not greasy at all.    Service was amazing and the prices are very good- you can get a pizza for $7! - the owners make sure you are happy and satisfied.   This is now my fav pizza spot in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I just came home from a concert and had an ad at our door and took a chance. We ordered their philly cheese steaks, garlic bread, and fries. Tasty, fair cost, plenty of food, and a good delivery time! I was glad they were open until 3am. Thank you for your amazing food and polite service."}
{"text":"This is the last time Sophia's burns me with their lack luster hit or miss food. I ordered two large pizzas well done crusts, one cheese one with two toppings the pizzas arrive late and over done on tops and bottoms and cold. Sophia's only remedy to this was to offer me half my money back. If you like good pizza under no circumstances order from this establishment."}
{"text":"Tried this place late last night. Got 2 XL Pepperoni Pizzas for $15 even. Pretty good deal, I think! And now we have plenty of leftovers for a few days.  There's not a whole lot of places to sit there, but I think they do mostly pick-ups anyway. Employees were friendly and polite. They had a nice big tv there for people to watch while waiting and they keep the a/c running so it's not hot like you'd think a pizza place would be.  I saw someone eating a Philly Cheese Steak and it looked and smelled delicious. I want to try that next, it's only like $5 with fries.  The pizza was good and greasy, in the right way. It reminded me of the pizza I had the first time I went to New York City, it was a place right off Times Square. Anyway, Sofia's pizza was yummy. It tasted very fresh and just plain yummy. The crust was good and thin but not crispy and the sauce tasted like actual fresh tomatoes. Pepperoni was... pepperoni. lol. I'm sorry, nothing out of the ordinary there.  Our dog really, really liked the pizza. It was pretty ridiculous the way she whined until we gave her some. Usually she doesn't make a peep.  So there's that."}
{"text":"I work right by this place and order from them just about every day.  The staff is always friendly and accommodating to our add-ons and changes.  The food is always hot and fresh, the place is always clean.  They have different thicknesses on the pizza crust so you can get exactly what you want.  I get the french fries extra crunchy and they're the best! They're chicken finger sauce is not your run of the mill sauce, either. It's got real peppers in it, and the flavor is great.  They always have good deals, too!  The original owners just took back over and brought the standard back up.  Ever since they've been back, I eat there at least 3 times a week, and even with my changes and additions, they've never once messed up my order!"}
{"text":"Meh...so...it was edible.  Full disclosure: I've lived in both pizza capitals in the U.S. That being said, the pizza quality at Sofia's was closest to something you might buy from the grocery store and bake in your oven at home. The wings were highly mediocre...very dry. I ordered tiramisu, and it was absolutely not tiramisu. It was FROZEN. It was sort of like a store bought, frozen ice cream pie.  We were hungry late at night, and this place actually had reasonable reviews on Grubhub. It was a mistake to order from Sofia's."}
{"text":"Ordered from them yesterday. Delivery was fast and polite. Their chocolate cake, French fries and wings are awesome. Their pizza has a crispy crust and lots of toppings. They send their small sodas in a can which is better than a cup IMO. Will order from them again."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious I have no idea what everybody's talking about please check my pictures I got all this food for under $20 it's freaking amazing and the delivery guy was really nice and cute by the way LOL"}
{"text":"We ordered the Spicy Buffalo Chicken Pizza & a 3 item Calzone. The pizza was dry & pretty tasteless (even the chicken). It's advertised as having bacon on it but I didn't taste any. To quote my brother there was \"hardly any toppings.\" The calzone wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special either. Frankly the crust tasted like slightly burned white bread; not what I was hoping for.  Neither of us really enjoyed the food but we were both tired & hungry so we ate it. The best thing about the order was that it was ready in about 20 minutes. Based on the quality of the food I can confidently say we WILL NOT order again. Smh. A $30 lesson LEARNED."}
{"text":"Actually wish I could give this pizza place minus stars.   We ordered a large pizza and chicken fingers.  The order arrived 60 minutes later... Pizza burnt and I can say I have made better freezer pizza. Chicken fingers awkwardly disgusting. Nor regular fingers like a villa pizza or metro pizza. Just plain disgusting. Not buffalo sauce but some weird seasoning blend. GROSS  Driver- rude   Do yourselves a favor pick another pizza place. We won't be returning simply based on burnt pizza, gross fingers and they forgot our fries that come with  the special indicated. Just thought of that. My order was wrong at 30.00 a pop! :("}
{"text":"I decided to get their bacon burger and fried mushrooms again.  Not sure what happened from last time, but it was beyond awful.  The bacon on the burger was very burnt, the burger was very well done and the fried mushrooms were easily the worst I've ever had in my life.  Sadly, that isn't hyperbole.  Not even sure how to describe them.  The breading was \"powdery\" and had a really weird taste to them.  Couldn't finish them and had to throw them away."}
{"text":"Well I spoke too soon on my previous review. Apparently they are under new management or something. We waited over 2 hours for delivery without any communication from the pizzeria. Pizza and wings were cold on arrival. The poor sad lil wings were nothing more than gristle. The pizza is absolutely night and day to what it used to be. The crust is rubbery and floppy and cheese is bland. I'll be going with a $5 Lil Caesars from now and saving myself the $30 and 2 hour wait time. Sorry guys you used to be greatness but now its just a bit sad. No one should make their customers wait for 2 hours without a simple phone call. Not to mention charging restaurant prices on a spaghetti-o's budget."}
{"text":"Me and a lady in my office ordered here on a Tuesday and had it delivered. My pizza and fries were great. It did take them over an hour for delivery but that was fine. My complaint is when we called on Friday to order again the guy that answered just said \"hello\" and was really rude. I told him I wanted a delivery and he asked where and I told him and he said \"No to far\". I explained we just ordered a couple days ago and he said \"No to far\", almost mad and yelling. I said the driver gave us 10 menus for next time and he again said \"no\" and then he hung up on me. Very rude service and we will not be back."}
{"text":"I wish there was a rating for negative stars.  Once a loyal Sophia's Pizza customer, I would get their combo pizza and horde it all for myself. One day, I got their combo pizza and something just wasn't right. I couldn't put my finger on it, but the taste of it made me feel ill. I didn't buy it again, but I didn't allow it deter me from purchasing from Sophia's.   I detest fast food burgers (McDonalds, Burger King, etc), but real burgers made from restaurants, I like. I had to get two teeth pulled a couple of weeks ago and that made me very unhappy. So, the week before I got them pulled, it was nothing but Sophia burgers. I spent like over $100 on nothing but Sophia burgers--bacon doubles, cooked medium, light salt on the fries.   Now riddle me this... at $8.99 a burger, how many burgers do you have to buy to spend over $100? In a WEEK?   The last set of \"medium\" burgers I got from Sophia's were dark are charcoal briquets and just as hard. I couldn't believe it! After a week of succulent burgers, they send me this?? My husband said they looked as if they had been cooked in the microwave. More like seared in a volcano! They were completely inedible. And it's not just a matter of taste--no human being alive could eat that food. Then they tried to disguise them by smothering them in so much Mayo that the bread disintegrated!   Yes, I complained about how bad these burgers were. They were awful! We had spent our money and couldn't even eat them! I've become quite the food snob, but even my husband--the human garbage disposal--threw his away! Nonetheless, a few days later, we still decided to give Sophia's another chance. I was going to call them and identify myself as the person who always ordered the bacon doubles from Grubhub so that they would be able to identify me as the lady who \"ordered $100 worth of burgers.\" I mean, whenever I called the restaurant, she said, \"Grubhub\" before I even got the words out of my mouth, so I know she knew who I was. However, when I got to the Grubhub website, I was quite surprised.   My account was flagged! Sophia's won't deliver to my address anymore!  So basically, instead of rectifying the fact that they sent me nasty, hard, inedible food THAT WAS NOT DELIVERED by the way--my husband picked it up--you refuse to deliver to me AT ALL now because I complained about that cardboard rawhide disguised as sustenance that you made me pay for. It's bad enough that I couldn't even eat the food, but now, you want to try to punish me for having the nerve--the unmitigated gall--to say something about it.   Thank you. You did me a favor. I'll give my money to Johnny Vegas Grill. Much better burgers for the buck anyway. Have a nice day."}
{"text":"This place is the worst now! Idk what happened but the quality of all of the food went wAayyyy down. Yuck. To bad I won't go here anymore"}
{"text":"I ordered a slice of chocolate cake and got something more like a chocolate mousse no cake involved pS I don't like chocolate mousse!"}
{"text":"During our stay in Las Vegas we ordered food delivery 2 times from this place. The first was a pizza which was tolerable at best as it was over done so crust was hard. The second time we ordered 2 cesar salads and 2 orders of garlic bread which took an Hour and 15 minutes to be delivered to us. I had to call and ask where it was as it was promised within 45 minutes.  Additionally we were over charged for the salads and the order taker on the phone indicated he would send 2 drinks to make up for the over charge. When the driver finally showed he only had 1 drink and indicated the 2nd had blown up in his car. The chicken cesear salad had no taste as well as the garlic bread, it was like eating a piece of cardboard."}
{"text":"Should have read the reviews before I ordered....  Specifically said no olives because of an olive allergy on the house and the pizza came LOADED with olives, really???    I called before the order arrived to see if they have soda and the lady tells me she has been trying to run my card and their machine keeps loosing the signal and tells me I have to it cash.  I look at my bank and it shows a pending charge???  When the pizza arrives I call the place and say I ordered no olives, her response \"no you never said no olives\"?  Really???  You are going to argue with a paying customer???  First and LAST TIME we will ever use this place.  You don't argue with a customer.  I know what we don't eat and OLIVES is one thing we don't eat."}
{"text":"They forgot the dressing to my chicken Cesar Salad. The Manager was totally rude and told me \"it wasnt her problem. The pizza was disgusting.  I will NEVER order from here again."}
{"text":"I can't stand the owner here after a few short or I mean alot of short comings here I finally complained brought my pizza to them after being delivered and they are a total rip off and all the owner could tell me was\"THIS IS MERICA BABY\" THAT'S WHAT WE DO! This place is total b.s. And they wouldn't remake my pizza after I complained one of my extra toppings I paid for wasn't on the pizza but then again he did pick his hands through my pizza and found one... Lol UN believable then told me to take it back...I told him I wouldn't even feed my dogs his pizza keep it and left"}
{"text":"This is second time here, so I guess I should write a review. The best thing about this location is honestly the prices. $13 for a large pizza, with the pepperoni IN THE CRUST?! Most amazing thing ever. The place allows you to order online (grubhub) annnnd you can factor in your tip with your total (but I don't tip online lol, only delivery) they have amazing specials, and it's in a tiny little shopping center near McCarran (the corner of Russell and Eastern). The pizzas a fast, fresh, and delicious. And definitely a better taste then say Domino's or Pizza Hut. 100% recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered using the MyPizza app. The prices were fair and the pizzas were good compared to the limited options we're afforded during grave shift. Unfortunately, I ordered fresh basil as one of my toppings and was charged extra, but instead of fresh basil I got dried :( If you don't have fresh ingredients, don't charge extra for them."}
{"text":"Delicious food, I highly recommend it! I've ordered here many times and it's never failed to impress. I know the owner had changed at one point and the quality of the food wasn't as good Ass the original owners. But now the original owner is back and the quality is there too!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke, used the eat24 app through help (eat24 is great) and ordered pizza for pickup just after they opened at 11am, got to store and waited, 11:25am and still closed with no answer on phone, eat24 contacted me and told me they couldn't get in contact with the the store so I cancelled order and got refund, I will never go back to this store bc of the unprofessional behavior of a restaurant, Google, yelp and your door say you open at 11am, that means you open at 11am."}
{"text":"Lil hole in the wall but their pizza is really, really good! Cheap too and they deliver."}
{"text":"I am a new yorker and here is the deal, Pizza here is good, its way better then dominoes,pizza hut, and  papa johns. Is it like New York city pizza? No, but its good for Vegas and at $7.50 a pizza its a deal too. Your only gona get nyc pizza in ny. Sofias does not claim to be n.y.c  pizza but there good and when you live in a dessert its a good replacement."}
{"text":"Good pizza, right price. They are very generous with their toppings and don't over sauce. I really can't complain, it is one of the better take out pizza places in town."}
{"text":"I got home and was not in the mood to cook. We decided to try this place as we have driven passed it several times. We ordered the combo appetizer and a specialty pizza. The appetizer was pathetic! It was mostly fries and they completely forgot to put in the fried mushrooms. There were only 2 mozzarella sticks and the fried zucchini were falling apart. Completely not worth the money!!!! We also ordered a specialty pizza. It wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing either. It's the only reason there are two stars for this review. Sadly you're better off ordering from somewhere else.  Also, if you order online, they come to your door with a card scanner. This is the first time I have ever seen this. Was a little weird to make a transaction at the door and wait for the little machine to spit out the receipts. Definitely not an organized establishment."}
{"text":"Ordered med pizza and some wings to the hotel took over an hour then pizza was cold and burned on bottom of pizza it was black  the wings we bloody. Never order from them."}
{"text":"The food was barely palatable. We ordered the spaghetti and meat sauce. Mushy noodles, pasty sauce and chewy meat. We also got the chicken Alfredo. This dish was worse. They used spaghetti noodles instead of fettuccine noodles. The sauce was like eating pasty cheesy dough. The chicken was almost crunchy. My husband had a stomach ache after the food. I didn't because I really didn't eat but a couple of bites. The salad and garlic bread were fine."}
{"text":"Pizzas and other things from menu are great! Everything is fresh,tastefull and delicious..."}
{"text":"Even as a cheap option this place is a bad option. 2 weeks ago I ordered their large take out pizza, when I walked in to pick up the place smelled awful...well I came to find out that smell was spoiled cheese because my pizza tasted of it too. I would be very worried about a place that serves spoiled cheese and is completely ignorant to what spoiled cheese looks and smells like."}
{"text":"Worst service. Some guy barely understood our order or address for delivery. He said we'd have our delivery in 35 minutes. We are still waiting over an hour. Each time we call he's rude and hangs up. Don't bother with this place. Bad, unprofessional service!"}
{"text":"This nasty bitch didn't even speaks English and sounds like she is smoking crack! Rude and he deans know where peccole ranch is , Fort Apache and red hills , I'm glad they didn't deliver death rats on my pizza"}
{"text":"Their $5.99 sign for their extra large pizza caught my eye so I decided to give it a try. Really good pizza! I've had their chicken fingers too, also good. For the price, their pizza is a steal. I ordered a similar size pizza from other places and it's double or triple the price. Oh their fries are yummy too, I get those with the fingers with ranch....MMMM MMMM!"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious pizza.  I love the sauce it's fresh and not over salted.  They are priced great and super quick when making that pizza!  I love it  More or a take out Doo"}
{"text":"2 hour wait for delivery and food was cold. Call Papa johns."}
{"text":"Cheeseburger - bland Fries - even worse Stromboli - good Arrived on quote time, that was nice. But there was a hole in the container the cheeseburger was in. Also, we ordered a 2 liter of cherry coke and we got two 12 oz cans. One was cherry coke, the other was cherry pepsi... really guys..."}
{"text":"This joint is straight ass. I was given 3 different wait times when I ordered through grubhub. As I'm writing this review, my friend is STILL waiting for his single pizza. It's been nearly 3 hours and we have gotten no word. Shame on ya'll. Shame."}
{"text":"Ordered Sofia Best through Eat24 delivery. Our ordered arrived at a little over an hour with a super cheesy Philly combo with a bread that my husband called bland and tasteless. Before ordering I was asked would you like extra cheese. I'm glad I didn't get extra cheese because the meat was barely visible due to the immense amount of cheese that was piled on.  I had the lamb gyro which was topped in shredded lettuce. I have never seen a gyro dress with shredded lettuce. During the delivery the lettuce wilted into a disgusting mass that I removed upon arrival. The lamb gyro meat was unremarkable and looked like it came with a gyro kit from Costco. This was definitely not sliced off a spit. The pita bread was good and not heavy.  Rounding out the meal was an order of jalapeño poppers that were mild and not too bad. They weren't greasy and they tasted pretty good. I'm not a fan of thick cut fries but Sofia's Best makes darn good fries. Their chicken fingers are lightly breaded but could use a bit more seasoning."}
{"text":"Well just checked in about to pick up my food don't bother using the yelp check in coupon they don't accept them or coupons , I don't get it they spend so much money advertising and walking up my stairs once a week to post menus but they won't take a $1 off lmao hope the food is good will be posting that review after I'm done. Stay tuned"}
{"text":"If I could give this establishment less than one star, I would.     I placed my order for my family a little before 7:00pm on a Sunday evening after a long day of work and promising my 5 year old son pizza night. I also ordered a hamburger for my father who is ill and was looking forward to it.     I waited until 8:12 and still no sign of the order. I placed a call to the restaurant and a man named Alberto answered the phone. He informed me they were having technical difficulties with their system and our order was never even prepared. I was floored. I asked him why, if he had our order in his hand.. he would not have contacted me and told me there would be a delay or technical difficulties? His answer was \"It's not my fault.. This happens.\" Completely unapologetic and rude. I explained to him that a 5 year old and an elderly man are waiting for their dinner, he showed no remorse.    I asked him if he was the manager and he said the OWNER of the restaurant was driving around delivering orders with her children in the car and that he is the cook!   Just completely shocked by this whole situation I expressed that their customer service was pretty awful and it was unbelievable how little these people care about their patrons. He fired back at me \"we don't have bad customer service... We just have bad customers.\" and hung up on me.   Please do NOT waste your time placing orders to this place. I ordered from them before and they were late but I overlooked it. The blatant disregard for a paying customer makes me wonder what else they care very little about- like hygiene and sanitation. No thanks."}
{"text":"I dont think it even deserves 1star rating! I was starving and I ordered from here after arriving home after a business trip and just needed something decent to eat. I ate a few of the fries and the rest ended up in the trash.  I ordered a pizza. chicken dinner and it was disgusting. I feel like I need to post this for the good of the people!!!! DONT order here, regardless of convenience or hunger."}
{"text":"I like their pizza and their special prices can't be beat. What I don't like is working over 45 extra minutes for a phone in order and watching the pizzas be ignored while cooking other items."}
{"text":"An hour and a half to have a medium pepperoni pizza delivered to our hotel, was told 40-45 minutes. Called at an hour to see if the pizza was even coming ... \"Delivery guy was almost there\" 30 minutes later ... Cold pizza. Call dominos"}
{"text":"Avoid like the plague.   I was staying at a hotel Saturday night and saw someone walk in front of the light of my peephole and then four (4) menus slid under my door. I opened the door and a moron in a red jacket was walking away; I told him to take back his menu and he ignored me. I told him again and he said, \"If you don't like it, throw it on the floor\" and kept walking complaining about his job. If they're using tactics like that to sell what appears to be substandard products then that speaks volumes about the business itself.   Avoid."}
{"text":"I'm extremely disappointed in their customer service. My sister and her friend have dined-in and absolutely LOVED their pizza. She talked it up and we decided to place an order. On their take-out menu there was an online order link, so we placed our order online. We were so excited to try this \"amazing\" pizza, when our order was placed we were told it could take 40-60 min. Totally OK and expected. Well... we waited almost TWO HOURS for our food. We had to call-in and ask bc we highly considered canceling our order. After we called, our delivery man magically appeared with our food. We only received a call from the delivery man to \"ask\" for the gate code that was listed on our order. NEVER AGAIN will we place an order with Sofia's Pizza."}
{"text":"Had to give them one star because that's the lowest they will let you give we made an order it arrived an hour and 15 minutes later with no pizza just the salads how do you deliver an order with no pizza we called back the manager who yelled at us that'd be another hour before we got our pizza when we ask for a discount she continued to say it wasn't her fault that we didn't get our pizza worst customer service ever 2 hours and 25 minutes later we finally got our pizza with no discount I don't mind paying for what I order if I have got the whole order at one time worst customer service manager screamed and yelled on the phone doesn't know what she's doing and can't handle her job please do not order from this place you will be sorry if you do we are staying at the Wyndham Grand desert and we are not the only ones here that are complaining there another 8 guest here they got their orders wrong please do not order from this place"}
{"text":"I am not fond of diced vegetables. Asked her red sauce didn't get it. Plenty if cheese, tho."}
{"text":"Nice staff. Ate one piece and tossed  the pizza. Ordered a vegetarian. Tasted like canned perfectly diced veggies. Spongy crust.  Missing Pepes, New Haven, CT."}
{"text":"So I ordered a large pizza, hot wings and 2 gyro sandwiches which came out to 49 dollars and some change...an hr later after they delivered the food we realized there wasn't any sauce on the gyros or for the gyros and when I called to ask b/c maybe they forgot it they told me oh we ran out of Tzatziki sauce and that's why we gave you extra ranch ummmmm well I was kind of disturbed b/c you just can't substitute something with something else that's not even close to it(ok yea they're both white ) but that's not what I paid for and when I questioned why didn't you tell me that you didn't have the sauce b/c I wouldn't have ordered them the guy got rude and told me no need to get all mad I'll give you 10%off you next meal...so I go back to the restaurant with 1 sandwich (b/c my daughter ate the other one hell she didn't care it wasn't her money that was spent) asking for a refund and I was cursed out wait exact words..... we didn't mess up your order.... but how this not what I ordered.... well you ordered 2 and you ate one.. I said ok I only want my money back for this one... no get the fuck out my store I'm not giving you shit back... wait what I just spent 50 dollars in here and y'all messed up my order and I can't get my money back he said no fuck you nigger and get out of my store...."}
{"text":"Took exactly an hour for delivery (which is what they told me). I asked for meat sauce but it's just regular marinara, it did come covered in melted cheese and is delicious though. They gave me a TON of garlic balls, yay! Overall I'd recommend.   Side salad and garlic bread enclosed with spaghetti are not pictured"}
{"text":"Sofia's Pizza is a small hole in the wall place. If you're looking for gourmet pizza then this is not the place you want to go to. If you're looking for cheap, decent pizza then you should try this place out. They have a large menu with lots of stuff on it though I've only ever get the pizza and wings.   The pizza itself has a very light flavor tomato sauce. The crust of the pizza is more fluffy then a hand tossed pizza. It tase like bread. I'm not sure what the cheese blend is but you put all that stuff together and the pizza just works.   We mainly go to this place for the wings. Their wings are decent. The sauce on them are average which is not a bad thing.   You get what you pay for and in this case I think you get more then what you pay for. This stuff is cheap and it taste good enough to eat."}
{"text":"Paid for Lunch is a perk that we have at work and we all decide on a place to eat for that day and we order. Well we have placed an order a few times with Sofias Pizza, The first time we ordered it was okay, but we decided to try it again...They take your order and get it to relatively fast but the quality of the food is not there. The pizza was border line the first time and we tried it again and it was a Grease Bucket... You know that your pizza is a little too Greasy when you eat it and all you can taste after is Grease."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst meals I've ever had. The one star is for the delivery driver and the bottle water. I ordered medium hot wings, French fries and a small salad. When I received my order, the grease was leaking through the brown bad. When I opened the container, all I saw was soggy French fries on top of my wings. I had to use a towel because the grease was seeping onto the table. I bit into very bland wings. They tasted like they were cooked with no seasoning. I ordered hot wings, and these were not hot wings by any stretch. The only benefit was that the wings were large. The salad didn't look edible at all and after the disappointment with the hot food, I tossed it. It was covered in white cheese and I could barely see any lettuce. This place delivers, so it's easy to order from here, but implore you....DON'T!"}
{"text":"Pizza took forever to arrive, left apartment code at time of order but driver didn't have it so had to give him the code again and then meet him outside since he didn't know how to find our apartment. Once outside driver was very clearly high. Called main line to mention this and was laughed at over the phone and told \"that's just how he is.\" Unacceptable service."}
{"text":"I moved around the corner a few months ago and has been my go-to pizza spot ever since. I can't speak for the other menu items since I haven't tried them, but as far as the pizza goes - can't beat the price for the quality (and quantity) -$7.50 for an extra large! The wings are good too!  Also, I've had nothing but pleasant experiences with the people working here.  They're always friendly and very efficient. Pizzas hot and ready for pickup in 15 min..   I was first kind of hesitant to try this place out due to the reviews I've read here but I'm so happy that I did  ..Love this place! :)"}
{"text":"Great price, always open and the pizza was fantastic!  I was very happy with the pizza ordered.  Delivery was fast.  Definitely will order again."}
{"text":"Cheap decent food, and it's available 24-Hr's.  I'd rate the food about a 3-Star... but they get an extra star for the kick-butt menu with TONS of different selections, and the fact that they deliver in Las Vegas 24-Hrs.  I found the menu under my door on day #2, and decided to place an order. The order came within 45 minutes, as promised.  They accept major credit cards, cash, and business checks. The Delivery Charge is only $1.29 - what a deal! :)  The selection of food includes several different types of items, such as:  Pizza, Pasta, Burgers, Submarines, Ribs, Salads, Appetizers, Gyro's, Fish, Philly Steaks, Chicken, and Dessert."}
{"text":"I was going to order from this place for delivery to my hotel but found out they charge you $3.50 for a delivery charge and $2.00 if you want to use a credit card. So my $9.00 spaghetti turned into almost 17 bucks. .that's horrible.  And they don't give you a break down so that you know you're getting ripped off."}
{"text":"There marketing campaign is Great! They left a menu on my hotel room floor.  Ordered a pizza and it was OK. Ordered Chicken wings and they were good. My favorite part was the chicken tenders really good! we paid 30 bucks for the food it was  ok wait time for them to deliver to our hotel."}
{"text":"I don't frequent Vegas, so I can't speak to the previous reviews. However, the burger and fries that came was delivered quickly (30 minutes), the bacon was crispy, the patties were delicious, and the lettuce/tomatoes were fresh. When I come back to Vegas I wouldn't mind trying their other foods. Five stars in my review."}
{"text":"This location for Sofia's Pizza sucks. Their food is disgusting. Soggy onion rings for one, when we called they said they are supposed to be soggy....WTF umm no! Two, soggy fries that looked like they were cooked the day before . Supposed to be a cheese steak . The bread was soggy and really dark brown and the meat tasted nasty. 30 dollars for nasty disgusting food that was old. There is no way this food was fresh. DON'T waste your money or time. Order from someone else. They are rude and don't want to issue u a refund. Plus when u call and complain they are full of excuses apparently they don't know good customer service."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing but the ranch is the best ranch ever. I've lived in New York so I know what quality pizza is supposed to be like. This is the only spot I order pizza from in Vegas and it's open 24hours!!!"}
{"text":"The Garlic Pizza is my favorite! Haven't had a bad dish yet. Use to live by the CSN Campus & ordered delivery. Always arrived hot! Friendly person on the phone when you call. Delivery driver is nice. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here because the promo flyer was in our room and we didn't want to go out. That being said I looked up the reviews too late and I wish I would of looked them up first before ordering because they are true about the pizza being the worst there was barely any cheese at all and even less toppings it was basically bread with marinara sauce we also got wings which were barely passable as ok. The appetizer combo was basically something you get from a frozen food box at the store. Overall a waste of 60 dollars. Oh don't do delivery they charge you way more then a pizza costs"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. I have never had any bad food or service. The pizza can be a little greasy depending on what kind you get, but grease is flavor right?"}
{"text":"The worst food I've had in my life. Ordered a lot of food. 6 dishes. They were all bad. Cafeteria pizza... yuck. Trust me. Save yourself. The lowest quality of meat. It was seriously hard to swallow..."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! This establishment is okay with their employees committing crimes. We called and asked for them to just talk to their employees who put their flyers under our timeshares door (The Grandview at Las Vegas) and they were just rude and the women who answered the phone would not let any of us speak to the ACTUAL MANAGER. I am a student and they stole my laptop with all my school work on it to finish off this semester and graduate. I tried to call the police, but you know how Las Vegas police are if it's not a killing or a shooting nothing really gets done. Do not support this business. Full of Shady individuals who will sadly get what's coming to them sooner of later."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the WORST experiences I've had ordering food. My PREGNANT daughter in law wanted some food after taking care of my grandson all day and was exhausted and hungry, she found Sophia's on Grub Hub and placed an order. We placed the order around 10:40p. The delivery time was supposed to be between 11:30-11:40p. It didn't get there till after midnight... so we were waiting for about an hour and a half. The food arrives and the entire order is wrong. We asked for pepperoni and got cheese pizza. The wing order was wrong and our fries were missing.   We contacted Grub Hub the next day because we were obviously too exhausted to deal with the mistakes that night. It took Grub Hub about a day to get in touch with us and they offered to refund us $2... what a joke! So then we contacted Sophia's the next day. A manager answered and said he'd have to contact the owner. I asked him if he had my number and he said he had it in the caller ID and that the owner would call me back. She didn't. So today (third day of trying to take care of this), I call again.   A woman answered and was trying to give me the run around yet again. As I patiently explained what happened, I started getting more and more aggravated as she kept insulting me by saying things like we should have called that night since they are open for 24 hours and that we couldn't have been too tired to call that night since we ordered food late... seriously??? We ordered food 1 1/2 hours prior to its arrival. Not all of us stay up until the crack of dawn. When I told her the pizza didn't have pepperoni, she said they put the pepperoni UNDER the cheese. Who are they trying to play here? There was NO pepperoni anywhere on that pizza. We took one bite because we were famished and it was so gross we had to throw it out. We tried to eat the wings and they were so bland, we had to toss those too.  Finally this woman agreed to refund our money but that she was going to report us to Grub Hub to blacklist us. Seriously? I'll be checking my account everyday & if it doesn't come through I'll be contacting Channel 13.  *** Five days... still no refund..."}
{"text":"Date(s) visited: about 1 time.  Food/Drink: 3/5 Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: 3/5 Price: 4/5 Parking: 5/5  \"Hole in the wall with great food.\"  Food/Drink: ordered a water but was not directed to where to grab my bottle from. Found out that refrigerator was broken and all of the bottles were warm. They gave me cold water in a cup instead from a dispenser behind the counter. Also, my salad was fresh and a very large portion (can't complain)  Service: Pretty good, everyone was very nice.  Atmosphere: the floors and walls could use a good cleaning to remove black markings  Price: I paid around $8.50 for a salad. McDonald's is cheaper   Parking: Good but keep your car where you can see it since this place is in the hood.  MY THOUGHTS? I'll come back if in town again and craving a last minute large and fresh salad.  RECOMMENDATIONS: Don't mind the panhandlers in the front...it's all part of the scene"}
{"text":"What the heck happened to them??? I recall several years back when their pies were REALLY good, New York City back home tasty good like Rocco's on rainbow/215 and Verrazano's further up on Rainbow and Flamingo. When your hungry, you gotta eat but it was very bland, like chewing a rubber cheese with less sauce and I thought Little Caesars were bad. I'm from Manhattan and I DEFINITELY Know what pizza's suppose to be and taste like. I asked for bacon and they grabbed chopped sliced a piece of ham to make it look like it. A rule of thumb. A pie may probably taste what it looks like and hopefully not too salty at that ..bottom line, I got what I pay for."}
{"text":"Service was borderline rude, the menu is not updated, so ever we try ed to order wasn't available, we got it to go..  got home and the order was completely wrong..  called and they said \" maybe your fault, maybe ours\".  That's all..  no fixn or solution..   and what we did get wasn't good..  frys soggy ..  Wings I didn't order were blan.."}
{"text":"The sign says 24 hrs but only open til midnight; 2 am Fri-Sat. That being said they make a wonderful pizza and the $6.95 Xtra large Pepperoni is great. Good NY crust dough style. Perfect for picking up on the way home or out for a work lunch pickup. They do deliver. Only has a few tables for dine in. Great selection means everyone will find something to love. Also good for groups to call in office lunch orders. The only trick is the parking/ getting in there but that's no knock  'cause it's worth the effort."}
{"text":"Sad sad sad. I was craving all the things I ordered for delivery. Unfortunately nothing came as I ordered.  I ordered online for delivery and I was stoked because it had been a long day and I was starving. How would you go wrong with a calzone and a pizza? Pretty wrong apparently.  First, I received a Pepperoni 1 Topping Calzone which was supposed to be a pepperoni 1 Topping Stromboli. I also received a 10\" pizza, which was supposed to be a 3 Toppings Calzone with pepperoni, pineapple, and jalapeños.  The order they wrote was short hand and I see that as the culprit of the mishap. Shorthand just ain't right when it's written wrong. All could be forgiven if the pizza and calzone were delicious but unfortunately the crust was really chewy for both items and the pepperoni was just not up to standard.  Sorry folks. I wish I had better news to report."}
{"text":"so, is late of night, there's almost no delivery places open around, i can say for the price and time buying is really good , i ate better pizza's of course, but like i  said, time buying and price! Is good!  i ask for extra cheese(because i am brazilian), and, did come with lots of cheese! so, thank you"}
{"text":"Horrible!! Raw and soggy!!!! Asked for well done and tastes like raw pizza dough!! Never again!!!"}
{"text":"We work around the corner from this place and is a small hole in the wall joint. We ordered 3 XL pizzas. Hawaiian, pepperoni, everything and wings. The bill was just under $50 and ready within 20 minutes after ordering, ready for pick up. I tried every pizza. The Hawaiian and everything where good. The pepperoni was average. The pizzas where sliced traditional, not squares. All in all, not bad for a quick pizza."}
{"text":"I love their large pepperoni pizza special. The pepperonis are under the cheese and not on top like most, so they as a nice flavor to the crust. And the crust is very good. They also make a good salad. I always order to go, since there is not much seating and it's not really a place to sit down and eat at. Also, the center is a bit tough to get into and out of when the traffic is heavy, but that's the price of good, cheap pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza at great price the burger was delicious and it also Halal which is rare to find in Las Vegas definitely will coming back thanks Ibrar"}
{"text":"I came here over the years. 90s-00s Pizza was super greasy and toppings would slide off when grabbing a slice of pizza. 10s-present I'm not sure if there is a new owner or not but one night I came here with some friends and their kids. We wanted some pizza and only pizza. The moment we walked in and not a second later we were told, \"Oh there's no more chicken, we just ran out.\" We are all black. I was like, \"WTF?! No hello? He thinks because we're all black that we just want f@ckin chicken?\" My friend then told the man that we came there for pizza and calmed me down. The guy realized that he upset me and apologized many times. I guess they were expanding and had a large dining area. It was cold out and no one else was there. They told us the pizza was going to be awhile but they let us in the dining area, put on a movie for my friends children and let them run around and play. They also allowed us to smoke in the dining area since no one else was there and I think it was part of the apology. Don't assume to know what a customer may want based on stereotypes."}
{"text":"Great food all around, I usually order the couch potato special which is amazing if having people over (fingers, wings, fries and large pizza). The only negative i have for them is that i feel like crap after eating it most of the time but that is because i eat way too much of it."}
{"text":"Workers are very friendly every time I've come in and the pizza is absolutely amazing would highly recommend this hidden gem to everyone."}
