{"text":"This was my second time ordering food from this restaurant.  We purchased a turkey dinner package (for 20 people) through Wagjag in 2011 and the food was really good

I guess second time is not the charm as when we arrived this year to pick up our order, nothing was ready and there was no turkey available for our order (they did find the actual paper order though).  There was 20 people now left hanging in limbo with no food and we had to scrounge up something at a nearby Longos (food was good but it was not the turkey dinner everyone was expecting)

We were hoping this was going to be our restaurant of choice for our quarterly get together but looks like they just lost a customer.

I do not understand how a business can operate like this"}
{"text":"Unlike Terry C, I can list many places that top this spot's veal sandwiches. Unfortunately, none THAT close to it.

He's right, the amount of veal is great for the sandwich - and the meat itself isn't too chewy. The bun is standard- and the toppings although nice when included- actually cost extra. The onions and hot peppers are probably the best bet.

The problem with this sandwich is that they've pre-prepared it cafeteria style, so the meat was fried much earlier and has been sitting in the (above avg) sauce for too long. The result is a very soggy veal sandwich. Tomato sauce should be added at the end to ensure crispiness.

I would stop coming here but I have a crush on the Italian girl that makes them"}
{"text":"For those that work in the area, there are a few places for lunch and this is one of my favorites.  I have yet to find a place that can top the veal sandwiches that this place churns out.  While I haven't tried some of the other pastas and \"heavier lunches\" that they offer, I really find no reason to.  

They start w/ a piece of veal thats so big, they usually fold it at least twice to fit it under the crusty bread.  You get your choice of toppings including cheese, mushrooms and some really hot peppers which is the essence of the sandwich.  Nothing else is quite like it.  

Try and go there during soccer matches (Italy of course) as they have a few television sets."}
