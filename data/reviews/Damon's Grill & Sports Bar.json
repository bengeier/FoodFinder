{"text":"Horrible. That about sums is up! Poor service, cold and under cooked food and a dishonest \"manager\"! I was there on Saturday night with my wife and some relatives that were in from out of town. We were seated timely, our waitress seemed nice, we ordered, got our appetizers and then it was all down hill from there. After finishing our apps, our waitress reappeared to say that they were all out of Ribeye steaks. Three of us had to re-order. Then we waited and waited and waited. A table or 8 that came in after us was getting served their dinners and we waited. The waitress told us our orders would be right up. this was at least 20 minutes after we finished our apps. Our waitress then tells us, they're plating yours right now and apologizes for the delay. The table of 8 finished their dinner and was paying their bill... we still were waiting. It's now been 45 minutes plus since we finished our apps and still no food. At just under an hour, the waitress arrives with 3 of our 5 plates and says she'll be right back with the rest of the food. At this point, I ask that she also bring back a manager. Before the manager arrives, my wife cuts into her \"medium rare\" filet to find it COLD in the middle and very RAW. My mother's chicken is cold and my strip steak is not exactly letting off steam! The manager takes back the filet and the chicken to have them re-cooked and the other entrees arrive. Another cold/luke warm steak it is. When the manager comes back he apologizes and says \"I'll take half off the meal and throw in some coupons for free appetizers for our next visit to make up for this one.\" I tell him we appreciate that but he can keep the coupons as we won't be back. Our bill arrives to find that he has taken off only $30. Our total bill was over $100. I'm no math whiz but that's not half. We ask our waitress to explain and she says she doesn't know what he did but she'd go get the manager. He comes back and says.....\"Well, you made it clear that you weren't coming back to I didn't see the need to give you half off. I made it $30 less for you.\" REALLY!?!?!? No explanation beforehand and no real attempt to make it right at all. We paid $75 for one of the worst meals I've ever had out. If you're thinking of going here, DON'T. You can do way better at a number of locations in the area."}
{"text":"We just had happy hour here. The house wine and domestic (coors, miller, bud) drafts were $1.00 off. We ordered the house merlot and cabernet at $4.50 a glass. SURPRISE they were boxed...either almaden or vella. I know because I drink boxed wine, so I can't complain haha. (Also, we watched and they poured our drafts at the bar and went into a back room to pour the wine, when there was tons of wine sitting out at the bar) I'm clearly not a wine snob haha but I just don't know about $4.50 per glass when 5 liters only cost $16.00. ANYWAY they had $5.00 appetizers. We were excited to see the ribs on there, 5 for $5.00. As I told the manager, they tasted like play-doh. We didn't eat them, and he took them off the check. No problem. The onion loaf was good, and we had a fun time. :)"}
{"text":"Glad to see this particular listing refreshed properly.  Damon's has been at this location for a couple years now.  The few times I've chosen it for our meal choice they have been more than satisfactory.  My only qualm has been their lack of larger drink glasses, after 4 or 5 fives you might as well ask for them to leave the pitcher of pop at the table."}
{"text":"Nothing to write back to mom about.  The only reason i eat here is because it located right downstair from my job.  I eat at Damon's when I am desperate and really don't want to walk any where.  I think their food is over priced a sald with bacon cost $9.00 that's a rip off."}
{"text":"I don't know why this doesn't show up.  It's been open for over a year.  On second thought, maybe I DO know.  I picked Damon's for lunch.  It was slow.  I was busy fighting a proverbial fire in my office and waved my companions away politely, mouthing, \"i'll meet you there\" as I talked to a supplier about shipping valves to a troubled jobsite.    When I arrived my friend James said, \"they wouldn't seat us until you got here.\"  I looked at him quizzically, the other five people in our group were conversing, and I sat down to wait for our host to return.  A minute or two later, he walked over and seated us.  I looked around.  Damon's has room for maybe 300 - 400 people.  There were (we counted after we sat down) 27 people in the restaurant counting us.  The host was unwilling to seat the whole party until every member of the party had arrived.  How much sense does that make on a lazy Friday afternoon?    We ordered and it took 45 minutes from the time we ordered to get our food served.  I told everyone it was probably because they weren't cooking it until everyone who was going to eat lunch in the restaurant had arrived with their respective parties, were seated and had also ordered.    When Damon's (which i assume is a local franchise not a national one. . . but who knows) bought the building that used to be the Pittsburgh Chop House, I remember thinking skeptically, \"really?  Damon's has gone out of business in two out of the two locations I know of in the Pittsburgh area over the past ten years.  They're looking for a new venue?  Cause the business model is such a cherry??\"  But I visited twice. . . once within a few months of its opening (it wasn't a super visit) and this time, probably 9 months later, assuming the year of business would have taught them all the sorts of lessons only experience can.  They didn't learn.  Not from the businesses closing. . . and certainly not from the time they opened until now.  Dead to us!"}
{"text":"It's a Damon's in the Steel building, what else can you expect out of it? They took over the old Cafe Euro spot sometime in the last year. This is in the building that I work in, and a lot of the people that I work with go down more than once a week.   Damon's is essentially Applebee's, which is essentially TGI Friday. They all have their theme variations, but their menu focuses around the same thing: \"American\" food(meat & potatoes). The quality of the food here isn't so great, but it tastes good - mostly due to an overabundance of salt in each dish. Beware this food if you enjoy your health.  The sandwiches here will run you about $9, some of the more specialty items will go up to $15. Some things can get higher, but at that point why didn't you pick a better place to go? Their sides are about $3, that's what I usually build my lunch around if I go.  This Damon's has a lot of TVs, I can usually see about 8 when I sit in the bar area, and they all have a variety of sports channels on. The bar staff is pretty nice and they're pretty prompt, even when it's crowded.  I really wouldn't come here at all except when coworkers are going, even most of those times I turn them down. There are better places to grab food within a block or two, and if a quick lunch is all you need then spend a little less on it. Also, who wants to eat lunch in the building they work in all day? Get some air, at least in the summer."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in where this restaurant has gone. Where? Downhill. The wife and I were in the mood for ribs. Damond was always a place we had good luck with their ribs. Luck being, tasty , not too fatty and a nice tangy sauce. That seems to have changed. The ribs were bland in taste, not fall off the bone meat and the sauce was very bland. Service was great, attentive and quick. I don't see this place being around for long."}
{"text":"Service at the bar from Sarah was exceptional! She did a great job making sure our drinks were full and checked on our meal.  She earned Damon's an extra star for her service and giving me extra lettuce.  The club sandwich was average.  I can't praise it nor put it down.  It was aight!"}
{"text":"OK call me crazy for trying this place again for dinner (I only had to walk across the street).  I liked the old Damon's so decided to go there for some Baby Back Ribs (their specialty).  What a disappointment that they were out and also shrunk their menu because of the Penguins home game.  Do they think no one eats out when the Penguins are at home?  I tried the St. Louis Ribs since I couldn't get the Baby Back Ribs or a steak.  Major disappointment.  Chicken wings were good.  The server doesn't know iceberg lettuce from Romaine lettuce.  A mixed greens salad doesn't mean iceberg.  He also informed me that I drank them out of iced tea so I better not ask them for another refill :)"}
{"text":"After a long flight in from the West Coast we were hungry and thirsty for some good comfort food.  Decided to try Damon's new, at least to us, eatery in Robinson Township.    Trying to get there was a trial - right exit from the airport, then a right, then an interminable wait to turn left, then a confusing entrance to the Holiday Inn Express parking lot to get to Damon's.  It was an early dinner/late lunch time period so the restaurant was not crowded.  The wait person was outstanding - solicitous, making sure we got a good seat to be able to see the multitude of games available - it is a sports bar - and brought us a sound box that let us listen to the games of high interest.  The happy hour special was a 16 oz Coors light draft.  Not normally a Coors fan but I was thirsty, and like I said, it was a long flight from the West Coast.  I ordered the special beverage and an appetizer.  When the beer arrived I teased the waitress about the size of the serving.  It appeared to be a 12 oz plastic cup with a head on it. We both looked at the bottom of the cup to see what it said - no information.  Later the manager came over to check on our satisfaction and I told her, jokingly, that I doubted that the beer was a 16 oz serving.  I warned her I was planning to take the plastic cup home and check it.  By the way, my baby back ribs were okay, my wife liked her hamburger.  I did check the plastic cup for serving size and it was about 14 oz.  If you include a head on the beer, I had a 12 oz serving at an advertised 16 oz special price, and got heat when I expressed sincere doubt about the honesty of the serving.  In the UK short service such as this is grounds for losing your license.  Apparently not so in Pittsburgh.  Bad Karma."}
