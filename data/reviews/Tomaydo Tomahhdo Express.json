{"text":"Staff was not super welcoming (they suggested if we want pizza by the slice that we go next door). BBQ chicken pizza was way too saucy. Tomato basil soup was not bad if you like creamy soups, but I didn't see any chunks of basil in it as a previous reviewer had stated. The smoothie was very good. The nice little garden salad was fine. Overall, the food was overpriced for the level of quality/taste, which was similar to a fast food chain (with exception of smoothie). I would not go again."}
{"text":"Tomaydo Tomahhdo is becoming one of my favorites , especially after having their shrimp bisque which they only serve every two weeks, one day during that week. Being such a rare menu item, it's absolutely heavenly when you can get it.

In the meantime, I have forced myself to explore other menu items, such as the flatbread pizzas. My favorite has become the 4 Cheese Chicken Pesto. The BLT wasn't bad, but I wasn't terribly thrilled with it either. The Ultimate Berry smoothie is to die for. It is oh! so! delicioso!"}
{"text":"We had this catering for work 3 days in a row and each day was absolutely delicious! Veggie lasagna was incredible. Pizza and sandwiches were tasty and the pesto was perfect. I will gladly order from here again."}
{"text":"A co-worker and I walked to Tomaydo Tomahhdo to grab lunch today. Considering it is right in the heart of downtown Cleveland, a hop, skip and jump from where I've been working for the past 5 years, I am surprised this was the first time I ventured in!

Well, I was really in the mood for a big, healthy salad and did not want to have to pay a fortune for it. My first impression was of a crowded take-out place with a handful of tables and delicious smells. Everything on the menu looked fabulous!

I opted for their Sonoma salad in an effort to make a healthy choice. For $7.95, I got a heaping salad made of fresh mixed greens, gorgonzola cheese, walnuts and tomaydos (of course!). DELICIOUS! I loved that they give you the dressing on the side and the balsamic vinaigrette was yummy.

I will definitely make this walk again. But next time I might get the Cobb, or the Santa Monica, or the Spinach!!"}
{"text":"Such an unassuming place; you'd never guess it had the best tomaydo basil soup I've ever had! I also got the tomaydo mozzarella sandwich and I swear, I would eat this everyday if I could. Worth it, through and through."}
{"text":"I'd like to give this place a 3.5, but that's not an option. I am a fan of this place, but there are some things that are keeping me from giving them 4*.

1. The price for a bowl of soup and half sandwich is almost $12. This seems a little high for a lunch, regardless of being downtown or not
2. The croutons and cheese they give you for your soup (at least when you get it to go) are so oily. The cheese, all 4 pieces of shredded mozz where just not enjoyable. The croutons where limp and soggy and just caked in oil.

The soup itself (tomato basil) was really good. I normally don't like when my tomato soup is pink because it usually means it's going to be overly creamy, but this wasn't. It was very fresh tasting, and a good temperature.

The sandwich (turkey focaccia) was pretty decent. The turkey was sliced thick, so it almost tasted like it was from a real breast of a turkey they roasted that morning.

I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken pesto as a wrap and a side salad with honey lime cilantro dressing. The food was great overall, but the honey lime cilantro dressing was fantastic! Great stop for lunch!"}
{"text":"I have visions of their tomado basil soup.  it comes with garlic bread croutons on the side that literally melt in your mouth once you've added them to the homemade soup.  drizzle some of that parmesan cheese they give you, and you've got yourself the best soup you can ask for.  

they have a bunch of other really great things here too.  i've had sandwiches there (try the turkey foccacia...yuuuum) or chicken pesto salad sandwich...they have homemade pizzas for one that are unique and flaky...they have gigantic salads leaving no hunger for your appetite to squash..and they have great smoothies.

this place is the place to go if you're looking for lunch downtown.  but they're only open for lunch monday-friday, so don't go looking for some tasty eats on saturday afternoon.  you forget the city is a ghost town after six on friday.

mmm. tasty treats."}
{"text":"The hunt for the perfect sandwich (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tomaydo-tomahhdo-express-cleveland?hrid=cEr05CdnbVP-nOohEu1fUw) began and ended here. 

I've had the turkey focaccia and the southwest mesquite turkey sandwiches. Both are fabulous. The turkey is tender and tasty, but what really stands out to me (other than the best bread ever) is the fact that they use tons of fresh and delicious veggies on the sandwiches. Remarkably, the lettuce isn't floppy and microscopic--it's leafy, crunchy, and takes up a huge amount of sandwich space, but not TOO much. 

The bread, though. Oh those herbs and cheeses and the way it just falls apart with deliciousness. 

With such fluffy and well seasoned bread, you have to be careful with the flavors of the sandwich ingredients. I feel like TT is particularly careful and knows exactly how to sandwich. Perfectly. I can't speak for the sides, other than wherever their fruit comes from, it's heavenly. For under $10, this is a wonderful meal and I can even stretch it to two, but I'm often tempted to just eat the whole sandwich, even if I'm not that hungry. Unhealthy eating habit, I know, but these sandwiches are so wonderful. They practically melt in your mouth. 

The staff is always super friendly and even brought our food to us outside once. Something I didn't expect and was totally out of their way, which I really appreciated. Nice people are nice!

It's almost painful to say this, but if you're looking for a sandwich downtown (and don't want a sub--Dave's is the obvious choice for a sub), skip the Cleveland Pickle and come here. Lower prices and tastier!"}
{"text":"First time here, it was crazy busy. But I was really impressed with how they didn't rush us and were friendly. The woman checking us out was even asking about our baby boy with us. 

I always ask \"what is the best thing on the menu\" or \"what is your recommendation.\" I got the spicy serendipity chicken flatbread--5 stars. My wife got the pesto harmony flatbread--ditto to my rating. 

Thanks for taking the time to give us a good experience!"}
{"text":"this place is yummy! 

Their eggplant lasagna is rich in flavour. the sodomy salad with their house made balsalmic dressing it THE best balsamic I have had.

pizzas are tasty..especially the Thai...

worth the visit to this casual local chain."}
{"text":"We went to downtown location which has outdoor sitting area. We had \"spicy serendipity chicken\" Flatbread and \"pesto chicken slalad\" sandwich. They both were delicious. The Flatbread is big enough to share for two, of course if you are not a glutton. Also, it is inexpensive for the food you get, only $8.99."}
{"text":"Go here for lunch! Fresh, tasty food. They knew my name and remembered what I liked the second time I was there. Really liked the Seattle Walnut salad (no chicken). In and out quickly. Made you feel welcome, and they appreciate your business."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years for lunch.  Everything I've had has been tasty but I like the Italian sandwich the best.  I work just outside of downtown so it's convenient to order online and drive to pick it up.  They also offer delivery for orders over $25, I believe.  Their eat-in space isn't very large but I think the bulk of people get their food and go.  Very fast and convenient!"}
{"text":"Fantastic flat bread pizzas.  We ordered takeout for the office.  We had eight different pizzas delivered and they were all delicious.  I had the Spicy Serendipity that was like a buffalo chicken sandwich, it was yummy.  I tried a slice of the Margherita, south of the border, and one with a fig sauce and gorgonzala cheese.

I ordered a Peach-Mango Smoothie and it was awesome!

I highly recommend this place and next time I'm in CL I'll be venturing here for lunch!"}
{"text":"+ They deliver 
- With no great sense of urgency 

Tomaydo Tomahhdo is your general one-stop-shop for office lunches. They do soups, salads, sandwiches (bistro and grilled), and flatbread pizzas, so everyone is bound to find something they like. 

Everything I've had has been perfectly adequate. My most-recent salad was a little heavy on the chopped iceberg (arguably the cheapest ingredient known to man), but I did appreciate the variety of salad dressings offered (I had Honey Cilantro Lime). 

Overall, a safe, standard bet, but nothing to rave about. 

On a side note, I'm impressed I made it through this review without referencing \"potayto, potahhto\" or \"let's call the whole thing off!\" in a sing-song voice. 

Whoops."}
{"text":"This place is great. I got the Seattle walnut salad and it was absolutely delicious. It was also ready im 2 minutes flat! The veggies were fresh and the dressing was excellent. Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but the service is pretty bad. We had then cater a party a year ago and it was good, but they convinced us to get twice the food we needed. This year the people seemed to be inconvenienced by our order and the food was mediocre at best. The veggie tray was carrots, broccoli, and cherry tomatoes. Not worth what they charged. I'd recommend finding another cater unless desperate."}
{"text":"Stopped to look at the menu in the window on the way to Subway and decided to give it a shot.  

The frisco turkey wrap had great flavor to it.  Fresh guac, and gorgonzolla mayo!  What a refreshing tangy zing of flavor.  There were several tables outside to enjoy the fresh air as well as inside dining.  Service was quick and choices were plentiful.

Pizza, flatbreads, and sandwiches of many varieties avail.  

If I am staying at the hotel across the street again I will definately be back!"}
{"text":"I am not a huge salad person at all, but ever once in a while I get the craving. Tomaydo Tomahhdo never disappoints!
This time I got the Farm Fresh Tomaydo Mozz salad with chicken. OMG it was delicious! The mozzarella came in big thick slices that melt in my mouth! Not a clue what the dressing was but it went well with the salad. For the price, the salad was huge, I couldn't even finish all of it. And the BEST part....it was fresh!!!! I got so tired of places advertising fresh salad but give you wilted lettuce and must tomatoes...not here! I highly recommend. I went about 12:30 and it was not super crowded, so it was nice and easy.
This place is super close to work and I can't wait to check out other things they have on the menu!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch before heading to the rock and roll HOF.  Decent food and quick service.  Service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Funny how the only place deserving of a five-star rating in Cleveland is not one of the (supposedly) hip and cool places that we went to given the (almost) unlimited expense account.

Still on the topic of unlimited expense account, I came to suspect that the unusually generous policy with respect to the unlimited expense account is given because of the LACK of things to do in Cleveland, but anyway....

After visiting this little chain sandwich shop more than a few times, I came to conclude that it has THE best chopped bbq chicken salad - hands down.  And this is coming from an anti-vegetarian, yours truly.  The onion strings and bacon strips toppings as well as the combo ranch / bbq dressing was nothing short of pure genius, albeit unhealthy (which completely negates all the supposed goodness of a salad).  

And the total check hardly caused a dent in the (almost) unlimited expense account."}
{"text":"This is one of the best lunch places downtown, in my opinion. They have a great selection of salads, sandwiches and soups. Their Tom Tom Cobb salad is my favorite item on the menu. It comes loaded with chicken, eggs, bacon, tomatoes, cucumbers and blue cheese. It's more than enough for lunch...I've never been able to eat an entire one of their salads.  I also love the tomato basil soup, Santa Fe salad and the Seattle Walnut salad. Really, everything I've tried there is good. Well-priced, fast service and quality ingredients. We also use them often to cater events for our office and they've always been very reliable about getting us the food on time, as well as, being accurate for what we've ordered."}
{"text":"came here for a smoothie ($5 for pre-made basic smoothies - i had the strawberries, pineapple juice, vanilla yogurt one) but was so tempted to order a pizza since the food smelled delicious! even though i came by on a weekday right at noon service was fast, friendly, indoor seating available."}
{"text":"One my favorite places to come downtown. Food is great, Nice size portions, & always Fresh!"}
{"text":"I got a salad and tomato basil soup. There were literally 2 croutons in my soup and the salad was basically lettuce and some sprinkled parmesan cheese."}
{"text":"WORST! WORST! WORST Experience EVER!!!!!!
Order Uber Eats
Order totally wrong
Item on website incorrect
Wait on the phone for 10min to speak to a human.
I explain we are at a conference & we just paid $35 for a wrong order
Get the order 1 hour 30 min later. Still WRONG MISSING MY  DRESSING!!!!"}
{"text":"Order anything on the flat bread...soo good! Above the great tasting food the service and people behind the counter are super nice. Very happy I stumbled across your restaurant."}
{"text":"Horrible wait times, spotty delivery service and mis rung charges ...why do I keep going to this downtown lunch spot? I love the salad and sandwich combos and ordering an izze to drink. Deeelicious."}
{"text":"Nice mixed veggie salads.  A bit expensive, but I don't know of any good alternatives in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"This is a nifty little place for lunch downtown. I'd like to emphasize the \"little\" part, because if you arrive after 11:59, you're going to be standing in line and taking your lunch with you. There's a good reason for that line- the menu's full of great sandwiches (hot and cold), big salads, and delicious soups (I especially love the tomato basil). In the summer, go for the sidewalk seating to soak up the sun on your pasty-white office worker skin."}
{"text":"Tom Tom for short is a little gem that presents a nice variety for the impulsive or indecisive. Whether you're in the mood for stone oven pizza, salads, deli sandwiches, flatbread, croissants, wraps, soups or even some specialty dishes like lasagna and calzone, smoothies and any combo of the above, you'll find it here!  

I dined in, enjoying the place to myself. It was around 2:30 pm so it was past the lunch rush. I opted for the soup and half bistro sandwich combo for under $9. They offered jambalaya or tomato basil soup. I am kind of a wimp with spice, so I asked the gentleman at the counter for his opinion about the spice level. As he knows spiciness is relative, he offered me a taste. That's always the best solution in this case. I was delighted the spice level was tolerable because the soup was delicious and satisfying. The full bowl was chock-full of chicken, sausage, rice, celery, onions in a hearty tomato broth, and served with some oyster crackers. I paired the soup with a half honey cured ham and Swiss cheese on 9 grain wheat, tomato, greens, red onion, honey mustard and mayo. 

Seating accommodates 18. There are outlets to recharge your devices. It's comfortable with air conditioning and ceiling fans.  There is no public restroom. A couple of their fountain drinks were out. Deliveries are from 10:30 am - 2:30 pm,  require a $25 minimum and is subject to a 10% delivery fee. Credit cards accepted."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat by far in downtown Cleveland. The sandwiches are a bit pricey but soooooo worth it."}
{"text":"Once or twice a week, someone in our office orders sandwiches for the entire floor. They leave them on a table for anyone to take. Two weeks ago, there was the usual offering of sandwiches at lunch. They were unmarked, but looked fairly good, so my coworker and I each took one. One bite, and we knew - we were eating Perfect Sandwiches.

We had no idea where they were from. Thus began our quest to find the producer of these Perfect Sandwiches. All we had to go on was the baked asiago bread and the fact that the sandwich I had chosen was chicken salad with cranberries in it. Not much to go on, but it was a start.

We researched sandwich restaurants all around downtown Cleveland, and stumbled upon Tomaydo Tomahhdo - we coincidentally walk past this place every day on our walk from our parking lot to our building, but had never tried it out. Their menu said they had a chicken salad sandwich, and we figured it was as good a place to start as any.

FIRST TRY, WE WERE RIGHT. Tomaydo Tomahhdo makes the PERFECT SANDWICH.

Their Pesto Chicken Salad sandwich is amazing. The pesto is not incredibly strong, and is complimented well by the sweetness of the cranberries. My coworker got a Turkey Focaccia, which she said was equally as perfect. Both were served on a baked asiago bread, which was amazing. You have your choice of sides, as well, including pasta salad, chips, and fresh fruit - we both got fresh fruit, and the pineapple that was in it was THE BEST PINEAPPLE I HAVE HAD IN A LONG TIME.

The staff is also wonderful - friendly and accomdating. We sat outside, and they brought our sandwiches out to us without a question. Perfect Sandwiches and stellar staff, with a price of under $9?! I am still amazed by how perfect this place is. I will be back VERY frequently, there is no doubt."}
{"text":"This is a great lunch destination if you work on this side of Cleveland.  The service has always been pretty quick given the amount of people flock in here.  I've had the flat bread pizza a couple times and the sandwiches, both were fresh, filling, and delicious.  Besides summer and its expanded outside seating, I found that if you want to sit down and eat at the heart of lunchtime, good luck!  Expanded seating on the inside would be very appreciated.  It was elbow to elbow last time where it seemed like we were forced to befriend everyone around us.  

Great place though, get over there and try some good eats!!"}
{"text":"Solid place to get a salad, a pizza, some pasta, or a calzone. Their Seattle Chicken Apple salad is really good. Their mac n cheese was a bit bland, but still satisfying. Great tomato soup. Next time I go, I'm getting a calzone."}
{"text":"If you work downtown and you haven't eaten here you either hate pizza or just love missing out. After trying multiple menu items, I am a fan. I have yet to have anything I did not enjoy. The salads, pizzas, and sandwiches are all top notch. 

Be aware that if you go during a lunch rush, you are going to wait. There isn't a ton of seating inside so most people get it to go after calling ahead. More seating would be great but the walls just won't allow it!

Definitely a place to add to your lunch list downtown!"}
{"text":"Tomaydo Tomahhdo is strange to me in that it is EXACTLY the type of place I seek out when traveling: inexpensive, lots of fresh ingredients, not a (huge) chain, vegetarian options, etc. However, since I work nearby, I fear that I have come to the point where I take it for granted and haven't been there all fall or winter. 

Every single morsel of food I have ever had from TT has been outstanding. The best thing ever is the Sonoma salad with raspberry dressing. Yum!!! But everything that is baked (focaccia bread sandwiches and of course, that delicious flatbread pizza with sweet, tangy balsamic drizzled on top) is so delicious as well, not to mention insanely delicious-smelling as well. 

By the way, if you are ever walking down East Ninth and you are about to pass this little plaza (next to a Subway) and you don't have time to eat, do yourself a favor and cross the street, because smelling that delicious Tomaydo Tomahhdo aroma and not immediately getting a pizza or sandwich to stuff into your face would be pure torture!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch downtown.  Fresh sandwiches, salads, and fantastic flatbread pizzas.  Also have cold Izze's on hand, which I have been addicted to lately.  Not a lot of places to sit, so plan on taking it back to your desk."}
