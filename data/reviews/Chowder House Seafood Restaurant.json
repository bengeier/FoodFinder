{"text":"Buoy oh buoy, was the Chowder House ever a disappointment. 
I went there for a recent lunch date with my lady, and we were both geeked because we're both seafood fanatics, and living in Calgary, it's hard to come by. And here was a joint that specialized in it - good times! or so we thought. 
Sadly, not. 
To start with, my lady only had the customary hour long lunch break, which, seeing as how the Chowder House is only open for lunch, you'd think they'd be used to accommodating the business crowd. 
Not so much. 
It turned out to be a late lunch. Granted, the place was pretty full, but late is late. Moreover, the halibut and chips we both ordered was just alright. It arrived late and lukewarm, and when you're paying nearly $20 for a meal, you expect a little better. 
In short, too much time, too costly, too bad."}
{"text":"Arrived at 11:45 on Friday 09 March while restaurant was still two-thirds empty, because our lunch break was short. Only two servers for entire restaurant, so they were preoccupied delivering drinks as all tables filled rapidly. Finally at 12:00 we ordered Halibut Oscar lunch special ($17.95) to save time. Meal served at 12:30 appeared to have been cooked earlier and kept under warming lamps. Fish was overcooked and dry, Hollandaise sauce evaporated, and tablespoon amount of crabmeat topping became shriveled brown threads. Felt like taking plate into kitchen and shoving under chef's nose, but only ten minutes remained to eat. Tasted like food from a school cafeteria!"}
{"text":"I have passed this place for 20 years as I've worked downtown, and always wanted to give it a try.  Today was that day, with everyone else hunting down free Stampede breakfasts and lunches.  I had heard mixed reviews so didn't know quite what to expect.
Food - it was definitely good, old-fashioned comfort food, for sure.  We had the seafood platter for appetizer, I had the clam chowder, one friend had the Mussel bowl and the other had the Chowder special sanny.  Again, good food, but nothing spectacular, like we would come back for.
Service - fast and friendly.  The single waitress busted her buns giving good service to all the tables.  Not sure where the hold up was, but some of the items came lukewarm, and it wasn't that busy.
Parking - non-existent, period.  Try street parking on 6th Avenue, you might get lucky.
Overall - I gave it three stars because, although the food was basic and well done, it wasn't spectacular.  The pricing was above average for all the dishes we had, so I can only assume they cater to the business crowd that accepts this combination."}
{"text":"I agree with L M.  The food was good.  Had the lobster salad and an interesting dressing (think it may be sundried tomato dressing).  Be mindful it's a BIG salad.  The seafood appy plate was not bad.  Liked the deep-fried fish, the shrimp and the scallop!  

Ate the mussel dish as I didn't want too much carbs.  It was OK.  The mussels were a little overdone and the broth it was cooked in did not have any flavour.  I'm not sure why there were vegetables in the broth.  Go figure!  

Note:  Chowder House serves breakfasts!  Wonder what that's like?"}
