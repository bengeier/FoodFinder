{"text":"Ordered a plain medium pizza for delivery --$10.55 (not bad). Very cheesy pizza with not a lot of sauce and crust that is not too thick and not too thin. A little on the greasy side but the delivery was pretty quick and the driver was very friendly"}
{"text":"As with all Irwin area residents, it is true that there are very few options for good pizza. So tonight I got online, once again, to search this site for the top 10 pizza places. I have had pizza from almost all of them and although some are decent, I am still searching for that ultimate NY style pie. Well tonight I noticed a new to me pizzeria on the list that I had not seen before. Tommy Gs. I read all the reviews and thought ok, sounds good. Maybe tonight I will finally find a good pie. Well I just don't understand the good reviews. The pizza was burned, stale tasting, hard and inedible. My teenagers wouldn't even eat it. Pizza aside. I ordered a Wedgie that was so hard it hurt to take a bite. I took the top lid off and banged it against my plate and it didn't break. So I got bad pizza. Not the end of the world right? So I figured I would just call and tell them instead of leaving a negative review. So I call and the person on the other end basically tells me the pizza is suppose to be black on the bottom and the crust on the wedgie is supposed to be hard cause it is Sicilian. So they offered no sorry. Or even We must have had a bad night. I didn't even want my money back or an offer for new food. I just wanted recognition that they put out bad quality food. Nope. I asked for the owner. They claimed they didn't know when he would be in because he never puts himself on the schedule. So no owner who cares about the quality of food being put out under his name and business. WOW."}
{"text":"Out of sight! We have lived in Irwin for almost 6 years and have a hard time finding pizza we love! We saw this place in the Norwin star, and friend it! Everything is so delicious. Portions, prices and taste are all in point! We will be ordering from here frequently.... I'm so glad we found this place!!!!"}
