{"text":"On our Arizona Brewpub adventure, we hit the Phoenix area just after \"typical lunch\" time to sit down in Chandler and enjoy a flight of their 5 tap beers.  Space has a fun vibe, an outdoor patio with some good music * sacks of hops in the dining room and the brewing equipment right next to the bar.  Husband is enjoying the hoppy selections of beer while I am pretty excited about the Bear Wallis Berliner Weisse Grapefruit.  Light but tart - instant fan here.  Oaked-n-Ordinary bitter light wood casked - was really great too.  Service was cheerful,  rosemary on the fries made catsup completely unnecessary   House salad with chicken - which seemed like an afterthought on the menu, was fresh and satisfying.  Burger rocked.  Bobby sat down with us an helped us make a plan of attack for more Phoenix.  Thanks Bobby!"}
{"text":"Aw damn, this place was amazing. If you aren't upgrading your chips to Belgian Fries, you are a chump! Live it up! The sophomoric IPA with the Green Chile Pulled Pork sandwich was like eating a dream. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight and grabbed some habanero hops chicken wings to go. Seriously phenomenal. Perfect amount of heat. Not head sweat heat, but lips on fire heat. Paired with a Suit-n-tIePA and it was a great meal."}
{"text":"Very Good quality ingredients.  Creative combinations.  We had good service.   Their app to wait for a table works great.  Not the best value but enjoyed our food."}
{"text":"Really!! Are you serious??? Why is this called Wilderness Brewing Company, when the food is as amazing, if not more amazing than the beer?? It is obvious the name does not tell that you get much more than you expect from a \"brewery.\" The beers are completely unique, and the food is, without a doubt, fresh and made from scratch. We came here on a Wednesday night...A WEDNESDAY NIGHT...and it was packed by 5:30!! By the way, the chicken wings are not chicken wings as far as I can tell!! They are some sort of gourmet, delicious chicken on a bone, that has been stripped of all fat and made to perfection and literally falls off the bone!! If you do not try this place, are a total idiot!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food here. I ordered the Momma Bird with fries. It was delicious! As were the pretzel sticks. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable of the beer selection. Also really enjoyed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nice place!    It's fun to try different craft beers, food was good and service was good.   Indoor and outside comfortable seating."}
{"text":"My first time here... food was wonderful. Service was ok... lots of little details could be the reason for a customer to return or not.  Seems if you weren't drinking you aren't as important as those who were. Just my perception but too many places that have a niche where I could go and feel more at home.  I could drop $70 anywhere and not worry about a flat soda or unfilled tea glass. This place has great food and if the effort was  put forward into service niche... that would be a go to restaurant..."}
{"text":"The food is always so good and the staff works hard to take care of you even though they are always slammed. The only issue is the noise level. Also the rosemary on the fries... But that is just my preference :)"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite brewery in AZ! They always have great beer and rotating taps of whatever new concoction they brewed up from saisons to imperial porters. They make great barrel aged beers and are starting to expand for even more greatness! The food is amazing every time and you have to try the AZ trail burger with the duck fat fries. Cant go wrong with anything on the menu. The staff is great and knowledgeable as well and the brewers are always willing to chat if you have questions."}
{"text":"Top of the line food and beer. Wish they could have a bigger building, but that would mean moving and I like how I can walk here! Don't let the wait scare you- it's well worth it.   You have to try any of saisons and of course the duck fat fries... YUM!"}
{"text":"Much better service this last time, and the menu has obviously been worked on. Bumping my review to 4 stars. Just wish it was closer."}
{"text":"What is with the headbanger music?  The burgers are really good, the beer is good but the selection could be better.  A lot of emphasis on saison as and other off beat stuff.  That's great but a couple more pale ales or pilseners or IPAs could go a long way.  But the music ruins it for me.  By all means play some heavy stuff but break it up some."}
{"text":"The only problem with the place is the same problem happening to a lot of micro pubs, they do not know that a pint is still 16ozs not the 14oz glasses they use at AZW, which is 12oz after the pour. Stand up people you are being misled and lied to. Not only this but they did not ask if they could keep my .27 cents worth of change from my bill, they just did not give it to me."}
{"text":"Waited for over an hour for a basic burger. My buddies got their food and I sat and waited and waited and waited. They first said it was on it's way, then they said they dropped it on the floor. I got tired of waiting and watching all the tables around me getting food...they gave me a $15 gift card but I don't think I'll be back to use it. Beer isn't anything special either (and I had to pay for it.)   They blamed it on their 'new' menu... Yep.. a burger must be a real challenge for these guys."}
{"text":"If you like fresh beer, this is the spot. Great beers, food and service."}
{"text":"We phoned ahead to put our name on the wait list. When we arrived on time we were told we'd be seated next within 10 minutes. 40 minutes later we finally were seated. Service took forever and everyone seemed to be in a bad mood. The sever even rolled her eyes when my husband asked her a question about their fries vs chips. She never offered any drinks to the couple of us who weren't drinking beer (designated drivers) and only brought water.  My food was so so. The chicken in my chicken sandwich was very dry. The guys loved their food but they were also drinking so I'm sure it tasted much better than it actually was. I love the idea of keeping things local but this just isn't worth the price tag or the waiting."}
{"text":"Great food!! And amazing beers. The patio is a little cold in the winter, so make sure you bring a jacket or sit inside. The pretzels with beer cheese are freaking amazing. I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"3 words, duck fat fries. Absolutely amazing fries cooked in duck fat with pot roast and awesome beer cheese mmmmmmmm  staff is friendly and attentive good local craft beers with growler fills available only bad thing is the small size which they are working on expanding"}
{"text":"Staff is always very knowledgeable about its offerings and are able to make confident recommendations based on my interests in both drinks and food.   Advice to owner: Keep up the good work and pay/promote the right peeps."}
{"text":"Beer is pretty good. I say that as a home brewer and self proclaimed connoisseur of breweries of the west.  Food is also decent.  Service is what you would expect from paid high school students.    Here is the issue.  The wait.    I have made several attempts to get in only to hear insane wait times like 45 minutes to an hour.  This isn't that kind of place.  Bistro 24, Houston's, Hillstone...sure.  Beer and a burger = an hour.  No.  Finally, just to check this place off the list I commited to the wait. OMZ (Zeus)   Do you own a grill?  Do you know where to pick up a six pack of your favorite brew?  Then you're all set to skip the obnoxiously long wait and have a do-it-yourself dinner. I mean anyplace that touts beards and the outdoors should also expect their customers to be able to grill just as well and use a bottle opener.  Don't own a grill?  Santan (ehh on food in past year)...Four Peaks....even World of Beer maybe?  There are others...lets just go with Four Peaks."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great beers and delicious burgers. The artichoke dip is very good. It's a small place and they are growing so fast it can be a wait sometimes but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everyone is friendly and the food is awesome! Try the duck fat fries!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is another gem! I absolutely love this place. It's always packed (not easy to get a table) but food & craft beers are top-flight. Totally worth the wait. I visit this place at least 4-5/year."}
{"text":"Can't comment on the food today, but the beers we got were top-notch! Kofa Belgian ale and experimental mixed culture. Super busy on a Saturday afternoon in the tasting room, but the bartender was still super nice. Kept our bottle cold in the fridge while we drank our pints. Parking was easy and they had misters going outside."}
{"text":"Excellent creative menu, outstanding craft beers, great environment, friendly service.  Well done Az Wilderness Brewing!!!"}
{"text":"I need to update my review as the service at AZ Wilderness has improved dramatically since writing my previous review. I've returned three times at the urging of friends, and also appreciated that the manager responded to my previous review. All three return visits I was greeted promptly regardless of how busy they were. I was repeatedly checked on and all staff that I interacted with were super nice. As was always the case the beer and food were amazing. Happy to be writing this as this place is one of my favs."}
{"text":"Host service was horrific! When asked what the wait was, I was advised, \"I don't know\". This happened on two separate visits (the 1st I immediately walked out on).  Server was amazing! Knowledgeable, enthusiastic about the beer, prompt, and friendly.  Beer was ok and food was NOT good! Had the fries with beer cheese and pulled pork, as well as meatloaf sliders (salty and hard).  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Never been so disrespected at a brewery before in my life and this is the 2nd and the last time Arizona Wilderness Brewery will treat me and my company with your horrible lack of customer service!!  I remember going there when they just had a little building and they were just happy to have customers!! Don't get me wrong they do have good food and good beer and I enjoyed going there cause they had a great vibe!  But since their growth which I was happy for them,I find their lack of choice in who they hire disturbing!!  I have worked many years in the food service industry so I can tell who works hard and deserves my money compared to some cheap snooty stuck up teenage girl who thinks they are it! At their first job at some new hip brewery that their mom dropped them off at.  My first strike with Arizona Wilderness Brewery came was when my coworker and myself got finish with working a long day out in the field we decided to go to wilderness for a beer. We went through the usual front door that we always went through. Which now was the wrong way according to some teenage girl.so we went back outside and all away around to the new back entrance to find 2 new teenagers that looked lost themselves! Mind you it was about 2 pm so it wasn't busy and there was not many people inside or outside. We asked for a table of 4 and they looked at us like we were some unservable bums and told us we needed to wait so they could find us a table??? Like they were slammed! The front desk kid went inside and never came back out as we waited for 5 min by ourselves outside for anybody to come back out and seat us. Did we just get ditched by Arizona wilderness brewery?? We were fed up of waiting all alone outside..so we left go SANTAN Brewery where we were created with smiles and a table right away!!!  Their 2nd strike happened tonight!! Our company's department took a half day to celebrate a work accomplishment at wilderness since it close and we enjoy the food and easily spent hundreds of dollars on food and drinks. First the service was horrible!! Just to get a welcome from our waitress took forever and there was about 15 of us so we kind of stand out!!We had to constantly get our waitress attention like she wanted absolutely nothing to do with us or our money! We When it came down to the finale 4 of us we stopped drinking to sober up.after trying to flag our waitress down (cause the place is sooooo big) to get some water. Not even half way done with our water another waitress came over and I quote!! \" since you guys aren't drinking any more beer or eating anything can you give up your seats\"....WTF!!!  15 people just spent hundreds of dollars on beer and food and HORRIBLE SERVICE and the moment the last 4 people want water to sober up you kick them out??? Who does that??? \"For other customers waiting\" she said which there was nobody standing around waiting for a table cause we actually looked!!! Never been sooooo disrespected and treated like trash at a brewery before after just spending some much money!!  Is this what Arizona Wilderness has come to!!?? Wtf there will never be a 3rd attempted you just wasted 2 strikes and now I will let all my friends know and for sure you know that my company will never hold a work function there again!!! We have better service at TACO BELL!!! IF U COULD GIVE THEM -5 STARS I WOULD!!!  its a shame I used to love wilderness when they actually cared about their customers!! Goodbye Arizona Wilderness brewery you have been cut off the list and been replaced by SANTAN!!!"}
{"text":"Good beer. Average food. Horrible service. Ownership seems uninterested in overall experience."}
{"text":"My sister was in town a couple months ago from the San Francisco Bay area and we went to AWB, just the two of us, we had such a great time and the beer and bar staff was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"The beer here is all brewed onsite, named after AZ hiking trails, and amazing!!!! Try the sour beer, you will not be disappointed! Service is impeccable and beyond friendly. As far as the food goes, I have tried several things and it's all wonderful, and served in biodegradable plates. My new favorite is their confit wings with the dry rub, I am pretty sure they are the best wings I have ever had. And don't forget to bring your growler :)"}
{"text":"This was our first time. My Mom saw a article on this place in a magazine several months ago. She had been wanting to see this place but couldn't get the time do to taking care of her Husband, my ailing Father. He passed recently so I decided to load up my 72 year old Mom and bring her here from Yuma. It was everything she expected and she had a good time. We had the Artichoke Dip and Pork Belly Sliders to start. She had the Roasted Beet burger. My wife had the PB&J burger with the jalapeño jelly. My son had the Pulled Pork sandwich and I had the Apple and Brie burger. My Mom and I both had flight of beer samples. The food and beer were Awesome! The ambience as well as the staff were great! Really neat place to hang out and it's Dog friendly. Definitely will be back there is so much more to try."}
{"text":"This is our favorite brewery in the East valley! The beer is great, the food is even better, & they have a great atmosphere. We always take friends here when they visit from out of town."}
{"text":"Great place! I love how local-oriented they are with their burgers. It's nice seeing businesses moving towards sustainable supplies. The beer is quite lovely. There's so many choices on the menu and to make things lively, they have performers on some evenings.   When I came here the second time, I had a server who was lacking on service. I had to order beer a few times in order for her to deliver; that also happened with our food. Asking for our order a few times is excessive. But we gave her her 20% tip along with a nice note stating she should be more attentive with her table. It's not that big of a deal, but this was also a lesson on her part just in case she gets a really nasty customer in the future.   Anyway, back to the beer! I loved the Table Tap Saison and Bear Wallow Berliner Weisse! Full of body and flavor! Coming back for more soon... as soon as I can leave this tundra of a state (Michigan) :)"}
{"text":"So cool to have this in the area. Great vibe, great brews and great staff. Unique craft beers that exude quality all down the tap line. Grab a growler...or two...or three. Their IPA is knock-your-socks off good. AZ Wilderness is the benchmark for Arizona's rapidly growing craft beer scene. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I grew up in the area and was pretty excited to see a small brewery where godfathers pizza used to be! I appreciated the atmosphere, its dark and fairly cozy but something was missing. I realized after waiting over 30 min from sitting at a table to having a beer in my hand that the service was missing. The stout was tasty but nothing overly enchanting, I've had far better but also much worse. After finishing my beer I knew it would be too long before I got another so I decided to just call it a night. It also seemed like there was only one waitress which is a poor decision during a Monday night football game. My friends enjoyed their burgers so at least I have something to look forward to next time as well as their mango IPA. I'm not sure if the waitress charged me correctly but $4.85 for a pint during happy hour seemed slightly too high for a beer that is just meh. I also noticed that 6 wings were $7.95? Im not a cheap bastard I guess I just dont see the justification. I do realize this is a brand new brewery and I really hope this place finds success and can pick up the slack a bit because four peaks and San tan are already well established."}
{"text":"I am always so impressed when visiting Arizona Wilderness Brewing Co. Their passion and dedication to brewing amazing craft beer using local ingredients show in their ever changing selection of beer. I must also mention, their food is superb and have never been disappointed! If all my fingers were thumbs...I would give AZW 10 thumbs-up! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Super busy but great food and great beer.  Love the decor of this place.  Looks like they emulated all of the national forest signs you see all over Arizona.  If you like San Tan Brewery, then you will love this place.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This brewpub is one of my favorites!  It is often very busy, but the food and drinks are the worth the wait.  The burgers are made with brisket, and the ales are fresh and tasty.  It is a bit loud, but that is part of the scene with beer and food and lots of people!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Stoped here for a business lunch, unable to sample beer but tried their Jalapeño Jelly and Peanut Butter burger ... AMAZING!  Also sampled their \"plain fries\" ... delicious, they are fried in Duck Fat and lightly seasoned with rosemary ... DELICIOUS!  The service by hostess, waitstaff, wait support staff EXCELLENT!  ... every staff member was super nice and smiling.  Great place ... next time we will visit their tasting room."}
{"text":"Had the red pepper chicken and salad. High quality and delicious. Add to that the granola stout and it was already a great dinner. However, I noticed the peanut butter and jalapeño jelly burger on the menu and asked for a sample of the jelly only because I would have been mad at myself if I didn't try it. The server was more than happy to give me a sample and it was amazing! Unique, but awesome! Great job and I can't recommend it enough! I wish they had the option to sell the jelly commercially."}
{"text":"I love wilderness for their beer. The food and service can be hit or miss. Have gotten dry burgers and wings. Have had drink orders forgotten and one time in particular the server somehow completely skipped over two of our group sitting at the same table... which was extra disappointing as that was their first and only experience. I still recommend them to my beer loving friends, but the trips now are usually to the bar or tasting room for beer."}
{"text":"A friend and I went there for dinner for the first time this weekend and I loved it! The bartender gave us samples of all the different beers that they brew! And the food was delicious, we had the pulled pork sliders on a pretzel bun and fries! I would definitely recommend the food and the establishment all together! In fact I've already started telling friends about it!"}
{"text":"Dont waste your time or money. For starters parking is awful and the place is packed as a result of not enough spaces and the restaurant is cramped with a horrible set up. You cant walk anywhere in the place without bumping into someone or knocking a servers tray.  The bar staff is nice but you need to get their attention if you want anything. I also find it pathetic they only sell their own beer. No wine or any other products. Seriously...and the beer is not that great..unfriendly atmosphere among patrons..and check your food order carefully before getting it to go..they have screwed up my order every time. Will not go back and am glad the place is so small and not wasting any more real estate than it already does.."}
{"text":"The only thing that made this evening good was the family I was with. The beer wasn't bad, however the service was very very very slow.... I got to the point of just drinking the water. The tap room bartender she was very nice but she was alone on a crowded Saturday night. We sat on the patio which the misters worked well to keep us cool, but every time we needed something we had to ask a passing by waitress that had to go and find our waiter. ?...Horrible service it needs alot of attention very crowded small bathrooms. ? This place could be alot better but I will not be in a hurry to return."}
{"text":"The food was good and my husband loved his beer. However I have a wheat allergy and they didn't have any hard ciders or wine. When asked why not the waitress explained that they only served Arizona made drinks. ??? There are quite a few wineries in Arizona. Are there not??? Sadly we won't be back because we both like to have a drink when we're out."}
{"text":"I moved to Gilbert in January and have visited Az Wilderness at least once a week. I like this place much. They only serve their own special beers which rotates options every couple of weeks. (They do not serve cocktails or wine though). Their menu is good and food is very good. I love the duck fries the best. They can get very crowded at times but the servers are very good and tend to you, will answer any questions and will bring you beer samples if you can't decide on a brew."}
{"text":"Love this place for sure! I come here every time I'm in phx. Never miss a pint here. Slainte (cheers)"}
{"text":"Really friendly bartenders. They offer to sample about as much as you would like and check on you consistently (in a non-hawkish way).   Beer is great. I'm more of a dark beer fan and with their Coffee Stout at 6.6% it's significant enough to not taste just like coffee. It has a lot of depth.   Their Russian Imperial (The Presidential) is extremely significant at 11% but not overwhelming. Great flavor and complex coffee and chocolate notes.   Cool space: less Brewery feel than restaurant, but cant complain. Worth a stop if in the area."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice and loved it both times. The food is great, the atmosphere is great, and have had good service both times. I enjoyed their beer sampler as well. My only issue was the cleanliness of their restroom. It was a mess and I'm a believer in if the areas your customers can see are a mess, what does the kitchen look like? Overall, fantastic and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Great beer, food with interesting twists from your regular pub fair."}
{"text":"Good food, decent beer, terrible bar service. Girl with short blond hair behind bar was awful. I'm sure this places gets better with time. I'd come back!"}
{"text":"This Place is Awesome! Great Food and the beer is special! They have high quality beer without an attitude! The staff were so nice and helpful and you can tell they love where they work! Go here!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic brewery... The IPA is legit and the food is very good. Place is always very crowded parking is a challenge but it's definitely worth the hassle."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Support local breweries! It's also a 5 minute walk from my house..."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is delicious and cheap! Fries fried in duck fat...need I say more? I'm not a beer drinker but I sipped a few and they were flavorful.  I would rather chug the beer cheese.  Ask for extra to dip your duck fat fries in."}
{"text":"I was a little turned off upon arrival here. We went to check in and the hostess said there would be a 45 minute wait. We went inside to see if the bar was open, but it was full. We looked around there and there were literally 6 open tables. We hung around and saw they sat unsat for about 10 minutes. I went back up to the hostess and asked the wait, she again stated 45 minutes. I asked why when there were so many open tables and she said they have to wait a certain amount of time before moving on. It was really frustrating to see open tables and just stare at them and wait. A seat opened up at the bar and we cancelled our spot and bellied up to the bar.  Now, is where my love for the place started. The bartender, Matt, was awesome. Beyond awesome. Someone give that man a raise! He called me by name the whole time, which was really cool. He was very attentive and honestly gave me better service than I probably would've received with a server.  The food was amazing. I got the Trail Burger and my wife got the pretzels. The burger was the best I've had in a long time. Perfectly cooked, the sweet chili sauce was fantastic and it had a good kick to it.  The beer was really good as well! I had a flight and couldn't complain about any of them. They were all high quality beers that I would definitely drink again. If I lived nearby I would be a regular for sure. I will be recommending this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"Good brews, good food.... wait staff...meh! It took awhile to get \"seen\"...then no one was really in a hurry."}
{"text":"My brother finally got me to come here.  Enjoyed the Futures Saison.  Tyler and Melissa made the experience a great one.  Tyler helped me get that \"vegan status\" which i appreciated."}
{"text":"Were in the area and fond it on yelp... As soon as we walked in ...\"CRAZY;  but we where soo Happy like they were pumping in Happy Gas...lol we sat at the bar with these big grins ...WE Loved it the Beer selection, and met one of the Master Brewers ..So nice Really a Bunch of Cute Guys ..The food was super great had the drummets..!?!? they were very tasty and the duck fat fries ..LOVED\" and great burger ...Really it  was I'm a bit of a burger connoisseur ...Sad it is so far from us ...my husband wanted to go back like 2 days latter ..lol  and we defiantly will...Was a very HAPPY experience ...!!!! TRULY !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breweries in the Phoenix area. The food is great and the beer is awesome. I like the burger with bacon and egg that is on a pretzel bun... delicious!  I am a stout and porter fan and I have not had one here that I did not like. I know they have a small selection of beer and it is only there for a limited time, but that is what makes it special. I had a smoked stout (which was one of the best stouts I have had) there a while back, and the fact that I probably wouldn't be able to enjoy it again, made me savor it even more.   I work at a hotel and every time someone comes into town that likes beer, I recommend this place to them. It is a favorite of mine and several of my co-workers.  I do tell people ahead of time that this place is loud and can be very busy, so don't plan on a quiet evening out!"}
{"text":"The beer was ok, nothing special! I think it has a good atmosphere. But really only seemed to focus on sweeter beers.   Granted they were out of the blonde and anything else lighter. We will try them again another time and re-judge!"}
{"text":"Been here a dozen times.  Love the beer, love the atmosphere,  service is so-so usually and the food is so-so. I say this because I've had 3 great burgers and 3 so-so burgers. Over all, 4 out of 5."}
{"text":"Best brewery in town. The food is excellent, and the staff is always friendly. A bit far for some residents in the phoenix metropolitan area, but well worth the trip. The beer is always top notch, even though they rotate their brews regularly. The pairing recommendations are always on point, and the cook on their food is always what you ordered. Get the peanut butter jalapeño burger (apparently a staff favorite not so much on the DL). Though anything you order will be exquisite."}
{"text":"Excellent locally sourced menu, wonderful friendly staff, and OUTSTANDING beer selection.  The most innovative brewery in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I had to write another review about this place. The first time we didn't make it past the hostess stand but after being encouraged by management to come back I am SOOOO glad we did.   The beer is great here! They have a creative and delicious menu as well.  And the service was amazing.  Everything came out fast the waiter was super friendly and knowledgeable about the beer!  Great place! We will come again for sure."}
{"text":"Great craft brews paired very well with their menu. Best burger I've had in a very long time. The appetizers like the artichoke dip and onion rings were amazing too! There was a long wait on a Friday night, but so totally worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Well I gotta say, the experience was underwhelming. I'll start off with the positive, the beer was delicious, each flavor we did was awesome in it own way. AZ Wilderness, you own it when it comes to your brew.   The service was ok, all i have to say is our server could have opened up a bit more to the information on beers. The lack of feedback was kind of a let down and left newcomers in the dark on what beer to choose.  For the food, I was super disappointed. Stated off with the Flying Pig Fry's. Overall it came out cold. Cold beer cheese, not a pleasant start. Then went with the signature burger. Was asked by our server pink or no pink? Answered no pink, wife not a fan of medium burgers. When burger came out, I cut it in half and found the burger still raw in the middle. Now I'm not super jumpy when it comes to rare meats, but this bad boy was raw in the middle. Server came by and apologized and a new one was made. Burger was okay, maybe even decent. But I could not get that raw burger out of my head, I could not believe chef would let that leave his kitchen. Burger should have been taken off the bill, I did not ask, but it should have been handled.  I sure do love the brew here. Started off so well and then the food sent me away. I certainly understand mistakes happen and food quality mishaps can occur. But overall just how raw the burger came out, I just don't see a return."}
{"text":"We live a few miles away and bike here or drive by after work. The beer is great, the food is phenomenal and the staff is always the best. They've been getting very popular lately, so if you don't want to wait 15 minutes for a table during peak meal times, stop whining and get fast food instead. If you aren't looking to whine over nothing, stop by this place for a beer, food or overall company. We'll keep coming back. -@collin_reed"}
{"text":"Picacho Pecan Pie Ale is awesome! Not made often, so get it while you can!"}
{"text":"First and last time I will ever come to this place! I was completely ignored by the waiter presumably because he thought I was under 21"}
{"text":"Came and had lunch with my husband on a Sunday. The place was busy and they had plenty of staff on hand to take care of everyone. Ordered the beers (which were excellent) and we split the beer braised blue cheese burger with the chips. Delish!!!! The past time we stopped here I had the spring salad with the blue cheese dressing.  The dressing is fabulous! The duck fat fries are also outstanding! Will be back to try more goodies off the super fun menu! Oh! The beers! Yum Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"Saw this place and had to try it on behalf of the east coast. The atmosphere is great, a bit loud but any intimate restaurant is. The max seating capacity is 90. The beers are awesome, their granola oatmeal stout is fantastic and their food is mouth watering and filling. What else can you say? If you're ever in the area give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Just ate at this amazing place. We were unsure how it would be based on the mixed reviews, but the beer was great.  Our server, Mike, was amazing and walked us through all the beer on tap and recommend several items. It was taco Tuesday, so we had the tacos along with the wings. First, the wings were out of this world. I am not a big wing  fan, but they were great; not greasy or messy, just amazing. The tacos were quite good, too. If you are looking for a great place to hang out with your friends and have a beer and dinner, this is your place."}
{"text":"We originally went to Four Peaks in Tempe but couldn't find parking, seemed packed and not child-friendly so we opted to go elsewhere. We landed at Arizona Wilderness and I'm so glad we did! It was everything we were looking for, easy parking (they even had complimentary valet) plenty of seating, lots of families with young kids, the food was great and came out super quick! We will definitely be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"What more can I possibly say that hasn't been said already?  This place is KILLING IT!  I love coming here and only wish I lived closer.  The brewers, the servers, every employee is very accommodating and love talking local craft beer.  Their menu is pretty simple but we have not had a bad meal yet.  I'm a vegetarian and their homemade bean patties are awesome!  Please DO NOT skip the pretzels.  Do I even need to talk about their beers....probably not.  They will speak for themselves.  Get here."}
{"text":"Went there expecting to be blown away both with food and beer.  I was greatly disappointed with both.  Ordered the Flying Belgian pig in beer cheese, which was supposed to be pulled pork on fries covered with beer cheese.  The pork was tougher than I preferred, the cheese had great taste but there wasn't enough to taste and when requested were charged for the extra cheese.  I've been to many craft brew pubs across the country and have sampled many different types.  I adhere to the understanding, \"All beer is good, some is just better than others.\"  I ordered their sampler, and was looking towards tasting some award winning beers, but only two would warrant me ordering them again, the Coffee Stout and Refuge IPA were worth the taste.  I know these establishments cater to a specific demographic, so I wish them the best.  The staff wasn't overly friendly, and we were hawked by staff to give up our glasses to they could use them again."}
{"text":"The most delicious burgers and beer in the East Valley, as far as I'm concerned. If you haven't been, you are missing out!! Service and crowd are impeccable."}
{"text":"Great owners, great beer, great food.  Thank you for touring our school Dads club through the brewing facility. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Garret, before saying someone is awful you must realize the situation they are in. Megan is a phenomenal bartender. The entire staff is outstanding. The past two weeks have been busy as hell for the staff. Saturday nights are busy as is, but Saturday nights at AZWBC are now chaos after the RateBeer review. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. Unfortunate sometimes.   This is a place I frequently go. The food is great and the beer, even better. I've always had great service with staff whether it be at a table or the bar."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer. My only complaint is it is very hard to be a vegan in this joint. Beware that they use duck fat for many things. I only have 1 or 2 options on the whole menu."}
{"text":"The beer choices are unique and the food was pretty good. Definitely not worth the wait because the service was brutal. They were out of nitro so the stout was not available and they were out of lemons. They were also out of flight glasses. Overall it was very disappointing. It took forever to get our server to take our order and the food took almost an hour to get to our table.   The refuge IPA was pretty good as was the Oaked n ordinary and the Santa Teresa. The Arizona trail burger was excellent. I'm not sure I'd go back except I really want to try the stout."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I've never had beers anywhere that come close to the quality of what Arizona Wilderness is putting out time after time. Add creative and frequently rotating taps, absolutely terrific food, friendly staff, a comfortable place to hang out, and a fun vibe, and you've got the makings of a standout brewery."}
{"text":"Great food, fun beers.  There is usually a pretty long wait time as this place is crowded most evenings and weekends, but the new \"beer only\" table allows patrons to relax and enjoy a beer while waiting."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely fantastic. The people who serve and make the food are absolutely wonderful and awesome at what they do. Everything is made from scratch and so much love gets put into everything that is made here. I'm not a fan of beer but my husband is and he absolutely loves it here and everything this restaurant represents for our lovely state of Arizona.   The management there is horrific. I love this restaurant, but  my husband and I will no longer support a company that treats their employees like garbage and violates their rights as workers and humans. They think that customers don't see what happens behind the scenes but we very much do. We will return once we see that new management has come and the staff treats one another as family."}
{"text":"Excellent service and friendly staff.  Great food- lots of choices/variations, and you must try their fresh chips, amazingly good!  I would love it more if it were bigger or they had a few more locations in the valley."}
{"text":"My friends and I always have a great time when we go here! There's always a couple interesting new beers on tap, and while I might wish for a bit more diversity of food, it's all great!"}
{"text":"For anyone wanting to support local craft beer, it gets no better than AZ Wilderness.  Top food recommendation: the Pork Belly Sliders.  Melt in your mouth goodness!"}
{"text":"Great brewery!!!!  The beer is awesome and the food is really good.  I was able to try every beer they had and they were all great.  Had the Arizona Trail Burger and it was great as well, I asked for medium and I got medium."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, I tried it once as the typical at work, what are we gonna get for lunch scenario, completely sold on this place!!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a while and i feel the service is severely lacking lately. Last Saturday (5PM) we dined at Wilderness and there were 3 of us. Food was amazing as usual but our server took over 15 minutes (no exaggeration) to get us the check at the end of the meal and also throughout the evening he was hard to find. They were very busy but in our last few visits we have really struggled with how long it is to get greeted and place and order as well as get a check. Also, this may be petty but we asked for ranch to go with our fries and were charged $1.00 for each serving. That to me is just absurd, and the cup was tiny. I understand up selling but charging for a condiment is just crazy."}
{"text":"We went in, not knowing anything about the beers or food. The beer pairing was fantastic and pretty accurate. The service was authentic (didn't seemed forced). Sadly, the food was bland. Tasted like some one forgot to add seasonings or marinade to the meat. I'm definitely going back sometime. More so for the beer and not the food. Great job, guys."}
{"text":"Good beer and decent food, but the place and its people have a real attitude.  Maybe this is what happens when you average four stars, but it's enough to make me chose Ohso or Wrenhouse instead.  Why not have beer that's at least as good and people who care about their customers?"}
{"text":"Hawaiian burger and rosemary fries were amazing after an 8 mile desert hike. Only thing I thought was weird was you had to visit their website for their beer menu (?). Kind of inconvenient in my opinion. At least post It on the wall. Regardless,  like Arnold said, \"I'll be back.\""}
{"text":"Never disappoints. The pretzel with beer cheese- amazing. I love the rincon red lots of flavor and full body. Hamburgers are always stellar."}
{"text":"Back to wilderness again and per  usual the food and beer was delicious.  (I always get the wings!)  even though it was a busy friday night with a wait the bartenders Jeb and Matt took great care of us right away.    I feel like every visit is 5star but today we decided to make it official!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best beers in this state! All different styles bringing local ingredients to your palate! Great food & desserts as well! Good beer, good food and good people!"}
{"text":"Finally a good micro brew and restaurant in Arizona! And ten min away from my house.   Their beer this far is excellent. The pale ales and IPA are not typical of most micros (in that places like san tan and four peaks hop the shit out of everything and say \"teehee see we can be just like stone!\").   The food has always been good, burgers that are actually done rare and fries cooked up in duck fat.     Real thought is put behind all of their food and beer: if there is something local that is good, they will find a way to use it. I don't not remember of the porter or stout uses local superstition coffee, but it will be worth a visit.   Oh, and plus one for the growler station. Always glad to see a place to get fresh beer in large quantities"}
{"text":"Ok beer,  but food is worth the trip here.  Just had wings with dry rub...  Wow!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place has it all. Locally sourced great food and well crafted beers. The video screen of beautiful Arizona wilderness spots takes me back to backpacking along the Mogollion rim and fly fishing in the White Mountains. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Great beer good food this guys know what they do. Have to try it so you can see for your self what im talking about"}
{"text":"Great burgers! One of the best ones I've had with 80% brisket and 20% chuck! Great beer too."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and I love their food and beer. The staff is always kind and helpful. We stopped in tonight to celebrate a 40th and I had the Bleu Burger with fries and beer cheese...never disappoints! Although the service was good, it wasn't great. The servers were a little too hands off. Everyone (about 14 of us) ended up having to track down the server individually to order food. Good people, great food and delicious beer!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great time here last night...  I had the IPA and the oaked 'n ordinary beers,  both were very good,  the IPA was my favorite of the two.  The food is also very good.  If you eat here you must try the chicken wings,  very unique and delicious,  the meat falls off the bone.   The burgers are equally as good, best burger I have had in a very long time.   They clearly use very good quality fresh ingredients.  The place was very busy but the food came out before I finished my first beer.  I will definitely be back, an easy 5 stars for me,  I just wish it was closer to my house."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Burgers are super messy. Beer is good. I recommend the Refuge. Yes, you can bring beers out in the waiting area while you wait for a table."}
{"text":"I am shocked at all the positive reviews after visiting this place. I was excited to see a brewery open in Gilbert and wanted to try it since I drink a fair amount of craft beer and love all types of pubs. The place is reasonably new and the interior is adequate, although only two tvs above the bar seems a little underwhelming. The service was good in that the guy waiting on us was friendly and the beer came to our table in a short amount of time. I had a flight of 5 beers that are served. While two of them were drinkable, none of them were good and led me to a lot of disappointment. We ordered three appetizers which then took over half an hour to show up. These were less than tolerable. The pretzels and beer cheese were terrible. It seemed like beer mixed with a bit of melted cheese, not like any beer cheese I've tasted before. (not in a good way) The meatloaf sliders were awful and the artichoke dip was really bad. I get artichoke dip at a lot of different restaurants and this was the worst. I can't give them 1 star since they were friendly while we were there. I can say that this is one of the few places that I left as soon as the food came out though. Three of us at the table all tried everything and were all in agreement. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"The best wings and fries in the east valley. Awesome beer and atmosphere! Just be prepared to be patient and wait for a seat if you come at a busy time. That being said, it will be well worth the wait!!!  Quick update: PLEASE try the pork belly sliders. Fantastic."}
{"text":"It's ok not mind blowing. I guess I'm over fruited beer and the hipster vibe. Nevertheless the place is good with a variety of tasty beers and the expansion helped with seating but now there are dogs everywhere....  Worth a trip if you haven't been."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. It's damn good. Delicious everything, it always has a long wait but SO worth it"}
{"text":"Had the peanut butter and jalapeño jelly burger. Yummy burger but needs more peanut butter. About $5 more then it should of been. Great atmosphere and good service"}
{"text":"Awesome food....had the breakfast burger, with pickled veggies, and pita & cucumber with hummus. Best burger I have ever eaten!"}
{"text":"I recently returned because awesome food and fun vibe. I was thrilled to be able to eat in the tasting room. However, having to get up and in line was again frustrating but then our waitress explained that's not the rule. You can do either and she brought our beers.    So much better. Food was amazing, waitress and bartender very cool."}
{"text":"So today the manager, Justin, and the whole crew at Arizona Wilderness Brewing Co. were so amazing. I brought Uma in for lunch and so many of the employees stopped over to say hello to her (which is super helpful as we try to get her more and more socialization). The manager, Justin, came over to say hello and meet Uma and brought her a bowl of water. When we left, Justin made it a point to say goodbye to us and called out goodbye to Uma by name. I just love this place. Such good people. If you haven't been there yet, try it out. I endorse places that seem to have wonderful humans on staff! They also have amazing burgers (try the local grass fed), fantastic beers, yummy salad (try the herb dressing) and duck fat fries. Mmmmmmmm. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It really comes down to the Peanut Butter and Jelly Burger! If that isnt enough to keep you coming in, then maybe the great tap variety will be. There are always great drinks available, year round and seasonal options!"}
{"text":"Fresh delicious burgers and many brews to choose from."}
{"text":"Friendly service and good beer...what more can you want? Oh yeah I got some sort of dip their...omg it was soo good. See you guys soon!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and knowledgeable servers about the beer and beer making process no matter the beer or server they knew what flavors the beer had and why they had them. They also new which beer was most to style and could recommend beers to your taste. The atmosphere was perfect for kicking back and relaxing with a new interesting beer. The decor is beautifully simple and made me feel like I was hanging out in a log lodge. As a beer lover or outdoor lover AZ Wilderness is a destination that must be made. The only reason it isn't 5/5 is that they were out off chocolate bunny porter and refuge ipa, not the biggest problem, but I wanted to try both. I highly recommend trying AZ Wilderness Brewing co."}
{"text":"The beer wasn't as amazing as I had heard but still good! I guess they had no sours and their aged beer(s) was not ready. The duck fat rosemary fries were amazing. For real the pineapple burger was over the top too!"}
{"text":"Fairly new brewery. Hopefully, a larger selection of beer to come. But burgers were amazing. The manager is very friendly and stopped by our table to personally welcome us."}
{"text":"Great brisket burger.  I think it was actually one of the best burgers I have had in a long time.  Your choice of brioche bun or pretzel bun. Great service from Meghann. Out of towners who look for microbreweries.  Fantastic,  especially since they haven't been open too long.  We will be back  for their lunch special before we go home."}
{"text":"First time at this place and my husband and I loved it!!! They have a wide selection of beers and the food is amazing! My favorite was the meatloaf sliders so good and the onion rings delicious!! Awesome atmosphere and the staff is very friendly! We will def become regulars here!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday!!! This place is awesome. On site brewing..great atmosphere. Definitely one of my favorite spots to watch the hockey game, drink a beer, and be surrounded by beards. Lol"}
{"text":"I came here one night with some friends to just hangout with them, of course I didn't want to be the odd one out and not atleast have some kind of appetizer to eat while they had their meals, I ordered the French fries  and those chips. Safe bet you'd think? I went home an hour after eating those two things and had horrible food poisoning... from just deep fried potatoes.  I had called the manager to let him know what had happened the night before and maybe to check the sauces  (ranch, bbq , and ketchup) to maybe switch those out and  check the last time the oil was changed.   He told me he would look into it, provided him with my phone number and no call back ever since. It's been about 5 months since and I will always avoid this place, in any location .  Let's just hope it was a fluke but I'm pretty positive I got sick from the food from here."}
{"text":"Great beer and food! Came in to watch sunday football the TVS where very small and half did not work..... But friendly staff and easy parking... I would go back"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but I can say that my experience was a good one. They have a dog friendly patio (a bowl of water for the pups and dog treats), which was great for my friends. I had the saison which was refreshing and delicious. My other friends ordered the dark ale and the IPA which they loved.   I would love to come back and try some of the food. I have heard great things about the duck fat french fries (from multiple people).  The servers are very knowledgeable and helpful. They made sure that we were taken care of and that our glasses were always full."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and ambiance. AZ trail burger was great, hot and spicy. Smoked Apple Gose I would pass, was not good too tart and smokey."}
{"text":"I roll by here occasionally, n the wx is perfect this afternoon for a few...the Brewer is like really getting into his groove here...Santa Teresa Enkel-single Belgian, and the Roosevelts are just awesome session bees and a 11% imperial stout \" American Presidential\" what a finish!"}
{"text":"Are you a fan of craft beer?  Well you found probably the most interesting craft beer being made commercially in Chandler at the moment.  These guys aren't shy about changing it up on a weekly basis.   The guys at Wilderness are true believers in session beers.  Little Guy Rye is a fantastically tasty, full flavored, low ABV beer hoving in the 3-4% range.  The berliner weisse is similarly low octane.  There's plenty of other things to choose from as well - nitro coffee stout, a Belgian dubbel, a lovely saison, IPA, pale ale, the appropriately named Big Guy Rye, etc.  Best part is their system is relatively small at 7 bbls, so these beers can go quickly at times.  New styles always seem to be in the fermenters and only a week or two away.  If you like varied beer styles that change regularly, definitely give these guys a shot.   The menu at AZ Wilderness is small.  However, what they do offer they do very very well.  I mean who does sous-vide frenched wings at a bar?  These guys do, that's who!  Literally melt-in-your-mouth, fall-off-the-bone tender chicken.  Absolutely fantastic.   The burger and chicken sandwich are both solid and the pretzel bun offering adds a bit of chewy texture that is nice.   They also now offer cannoli nachos for dessert that are amazing.  Highly recommend those with the nitro coffee stout as a great way to end the evening."}
{"text":"Awesome place for great craft beer. Food is generally delicious especially the belgian fries. If they could keep a few regular beers consistently on tap it would definitely earn that 5th star."}
{"text":"Apparently the beard owners of this magical place do not always know what is going on. It pains me to provide this once fine establishment with 1 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Wow this place is awesome!  We found it by accident the other day when looking for a restaurant to eat at, I'm glad we went.  Their beer selection is nothing huge like Stone or the big name breweries, but what they do have is very good.  I'm an IPA fan and theirs was surprisingly awesome!  Most smaller companies don't impress me with their IPA like this one did, but it sort of reminded me of a San Diego style West Coast IPA flavor.  Most breweries I've been to in Arizona do not have the best food, but wow, this was surprising!  The fries were some of the best I've ever had; they are cooked in duck fat and sprinkled with thyme and rosemary, so yes upgrade to fries instead of chips.  I had the Arizona Burger and that thing was awesome!  Everything from the pretzel bun, the crispy lettuce, thick ass bacon, and perfectly cooked burger was impressive.  I would recommend this to anyone on lunch break even if they couldn't have a beer."}
{"text":"These guys have been doing it proper since day 1. No bullshit. Go here and drink lots of their brew. You can thank me later. ...Also their dirty hop water series is some of the dankiest shit Arizona has ever seen."}
{"text":"I had high expectations after reading the first few glowing reviews.  I liked...   The service:  They were friendly, attentive & knowledgeable, taking the time to tell us a little about each of their beers.  The atmosphere: very comfortable, good music.  I didn't like the...  The beer:  I prefer hoppy beer, which they had none so we tried tasters of what they did have.  They we're all just OK - the coffee stout was way too java, the bitter beer tasted more like a sour lemonade than beer.  They didn't list any guest beers.  If you can't keep your own beers in stock - you have to offer alternatives to keep us hop-heads happy.   The food:  A very limited menu with several items \"not available\" that day.  I had a spring mix salad and wings, both were unremarkable.  We left hungry & thirsty."}
{"text":"Love the beer!!! Fantastic beer.  Service was on par except for the \"please don't move seats\" cause we'll lose track of billing.  Moving around as your evening goes just happens so... ?  Get an updated computer system.  Other than that,  great beer which is the whole reason for going to this place."}
{"text":"Only tried appetizers and beer but wow. Their beers are some of my favorite in the Phoenix area. The place also has a great vibe and an extremely friendly staff. They have reasonably priced flight so you can try everything."}
{"text":"Great and interesting beers and food. Completely worth the trip. A great experience from the staff, food and beer. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The guys are great, the beer is solid, but I really, really recommend the food. Not usually the case when I come to a brewery, but they have the food WRAPPED. UP."}
{"text":"Cool little micro brew pub, and nice change of pace from 4Peaks or San Tan.     The beer selection is good (as it should be for a brew pub) and the food is typical style food.  Nothing to write home about, but not disappointing either.   The beer is where it's at here.  If you like IPA's IMO this place has one of the best IPA's in town if not the West Coast.    Try it out and best of all if you like it, growlers are only a fill away."}
{"text":"Came here for 'brunch' with a friend.  Great service and fantastic burgers.  Next time I can hardly wait to try a brew!"}
{"text":"The 50/50 burger (I forget the name) and the pale ale together are heaven.  I understand they just won a HUGE Beer Advocate World Wide Award for their Beer.  That's LOCAL AZ Beer Baby!!!!   That Deserves 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"I first visited this place shortly after it opened up. At that time it seemed just ok. Gave it another try tonight; place seems to have matured nicely! Beer selection was good. (For the reviewer who was complaining the about lack beers that weren't their own... It's a microbrewery! If you want the mass produced stuff... stick with chain restaurants.) Most of the beers were on the high alcohol % side so you may want to decide in advance who's the designated driver. The Refuge IPA was excellent! And the others I tasted were pretty good, too. Burgers were also very tasty. Service was friendly and attentive enough. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best chicken wings I've ever had in my life. Taco Tuesday is bomb too. Any meat you order is so tender. I highly suggest getting a flight so you can try all the beers. I'm hooked and have become a regular."}
{"text":"I wish this place deserved more than 2 stars.  This is a Arizona-state wilderness themed brewery. It's off Country Club Rd, which turns into 87 and continues up into Payson and the beautiful rim country area. I love this theme and how it relates to its location. They have a great logo and sell merchandise. As we were drinking IPA's, my buddy and I were commenting on their designs. I was thinking of buying a shirt. I really wanted to love this place, if only so I could wear their merch.  The food menu was pricey, but it looked like there were some good quality, tasty items. I ordered a burger, asked for a substitute cheese. The server wrote it down. Then he asked if I want chips, fries, or onion rings. I went with the fries. All good.  The food came out. It was meh-okay.  The fries were good and well-seasoned. They served them with an alternative ketchup that was very good (not sure if it's homemade or a purchased non-Heinz tasting ketchup.) The burger itself wasn't anything impressive. It had good presentation, but the flavor didn't match. But whatever, it was fine.  The bill came and I was charged $1 for cheese and $2 for fries. Mind you, the prices were already on the high end, so this caught my attention quickly. I told the server, who agreed right away that the cheese charge was a mistake because I substituted. The fries, I was told, was extra as written on the menu. I honestly didn't know or see this. The way it was presented to me while ordering, I thought it was just an option. Most of the time I don't even get fries because of health, so if I knew there's 0 chance I'd have gone with them. I relayed this to the server, who promised to ask the manager. It came back negative, since it was written on the menu I had to pay the $2!  I'm sorry, but this wasn't an appropriate response to your customer. I paid and left.  Why would you tarnish your customer's experience over a $2 billing discrepancy? I live around you. I go out to eat 7-10 meals per week. I pay cash at local restaurants that I value having in my community because I'd rather all my money go to you, instead of a cut going to a large credit-card company. I was considering buying a shirt from you. I often make decisions with friends about where to go out.  Fortunately, there are other local breweries I can support. I hope fellow Yelpers will also considering going elsewhere too, as there's no shortage. And to be honest, even without this little issue I would say the food only deserves 3 stars. The beer, atmosphere and branding is higher, but overall it's not enough for me to return."}
{"text":"I really like this brewing company. It has a really cool layout and atmosphere. My boyfriend and I sat at the bar in the tap room and our bartender Annie was really nice. She was super helpful when helping us pick out a beer. The food is really good also. I got the jalapeño popper chicken sandwich with fries. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Food is so delicious . The wings are a must . They are the best wings I've ever had. There flight is the way to go. Awesome atmosphere . Service was great ."}
{"text":"Beer is fantastic. Everyday they have a different food special. I have never had anything that tasted bad here. Fries are cooked in duck fat and the wings are excellent. Their tacos on Taco Tuesday are better than most tacos anywhere else."}
{"text":"Beer selection is good. Food is spot on. One time fries were cold and they were immediately replaced and comped. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for casual pub style food."}
{"text":"So excited to finally try this place out! I was already a fan of their local business collaboration, but now that we've been there, I will definitely be going back. We went on a busy Friday night and while we were given a higher time wait estimate, we were seated in about 20 minutes, which was great! We were a party of 5 with two vegans, while I would love to see them add some actual vegan options to their menu, our wait staff was awesome at helping us take their vegetarian options and make them work. The beer was delicious! We had a person serving us that was finishing her last day of training, but you'd never know it, she was great and especially patient with my many questions about how the food and beer was made. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Beers are tasty and I went o Taco Tuesday.  The tacos were really good and they were only 2 dollars each.  Nice...  There were 6 different beers flowing this day and the only one i didn't care for was the white wheat.  I thought id be a little adventurous because the flour they used was from Hayden mills.  anyways..  The IPA and their red were both really, really good.  Definitely a place to revisit."}
{"text":"Excellent beer, great burgers, and a fantastically friendly staff. If you're in Gilbert and want a great mini brewery and food experience, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Wow!!! First, while we are travelling, I love any place that allows dogs. We got here at 11:15 am and the misters were on; it was 82 degrees. We knew we were in the right place. Diego got water and we enjoyed the beer. My husband had  the Porter, calling it \"light and smooth.\" I really enjoyed the Wit and live that local ingredients are in it. Today's special was the Cuban Elvis: smashed plantains, house peanut butter, Bacon, and pineapple, all battered and fried. Interesting, yeah?  But not what we ordered. My husband had the peanut butter and jalapeño jelly burger: to die for, come back in a heartbeat! And if we lived here, he might!! I really enjoyed the chicken and jalapeño popper sandwich. The scallion cream cheese was such a mellowing addition. I upgraded to the Belgian waffle onion rings which were good but really enhanced by the sriracha maple ketchup! No salt on the table and I, who salts everything, did not miss it! We would so happily return here to try the Cuban Elvis, the 'America fries, and the cannoli nachos, a dessert.  It's nice to visit a brewery with an inventive menu!"}
{"text":"As you have read they have great Fries and their IPA isn't bad either.  Sally had a flight of their beer... it was so good she almost fell down and hit her head!"}
{"text":"Great beer and food. My brother got the PB&J burger and loved it! Our waitress was great! We will be back!"}
{"text":"The best pretzel sticks!!! Love the choices in craft beer, especially the sours. Staff is always friendly and the specialty hamburgers are cooked perfectly. Try the peanut butter and jelly burger with house chips."}
{"text":"Went here for Christmas Eve lunch with the family. My brother is a craft beer lover, like myself, so we thought it would the perfect place to try. I had the Hawaiian burger which was spicy and sweet and real mess to eat....totally worth it though. W also tried the duck fat fries with pulled pork and beer cheese. Delicious! My parents shared the local special, which was very tasty. The beers were really great here. The only reason I am giving this place 4 stars and not 5 is because they ran out of flight glasses, so we were unable to order a flight of beer.... Which is why we came in the first place. My brother was pouting for nearly the whole meal. Will be back soon, and hopefully they have resolved their issue with the shortage of flight glasses."}
{"text":"Very very cool spot.  I love the whole ambiance inside of this place.  I love how the ingredients are local and how the menu is based off of the availability of items during certain seasons.  The Artichoke Dip from here is a MUST.  Most artichoke dip tastes the same everywhere you go, but this one is fire.  There are green chilies and cayenne pepper in it.  Wow.  I could eat a whole bowl of it.  It is the best I have ever had from anywhere.  It is so different that I get cravings for this.  The Black Bean Burger is a great pic for something on the healthier side, but what is even more amazing is the side...  You do get to choose between several sides, but you absolutely need to give the Beet and Apple salad a shot.  It is comprised of beets, apple slices, horseradish vinaigrette, blue cheese crumbles, and pecans.  Sounds strange, I know, I know.  But it is so different and absolutely perfect how all the flavors and textures work so harmoniously with one another.  It is so unique and I can't even describe to you how incredible this dish is.  Please give it a try!!!!  You will not be disappointed.  Love this place, can't wait for it to cool down to take advantage of the patio seating!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place, great Brisket burger, and great beer. Very Friendly atmosphere and loved all the photos of Arizona on the walls."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and decided to check it out. It did not disappoint!! The beer selections is big and all are awesome. Bryce was our server and he was able to tell us everything we needed to know about the beer selection and food. The food was excellent! It was a terrific experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Best beers in town! Great food selection. Awesome staff and service! It's a must if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"There really is nothing more I can say, I am, and since they opened have been, a Wilderness Brewery groupie.   My friend and I were driving down the street about a year and a half ago and saw the brewery. Walked up and the doors were locked and we noticed a sign that they were not open yet. As we walked away the owner opened the door and said that if we wanted beer they could serve us.  From that day forward I have been there more times than I can think. I am there to try all their beers, which I will say are not always my favorite but damn am I glad they are doing something different than the standard four beers most breweries do. I could drink the Lil' Guy all day long. Their Refuge IPA is steller, and I love all their stouts and porters.  Bar food here is top notch. I never considered myself a burger and fries guy until Wilderness brewery. I find myself craving their beer cheese and pulled pork fries all the damn time.  My picture is on the wall. I bring everyone I can there whenever I can. I cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"You just have to stop in and try it for yourself. I could write a small book on all of the good stuff going on here. Food? Original & tasty. Beer? Your choices of their local brews are changing and original. Ambiance and staff that are on their toes rounds out a top notch culinary experience!"}
{"text":"Always get the After The Hike burger with Flying Belgian Pig fries and a flight.  The tri tip sandwiches are also really amazing.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"The artichoke dip is to die for & the beer is also pretty amazing! Thanks for great service too!"}
{"text":"I loved the limited menu in which everything was excellent--burgers, wings, and fruit salad.  Add some really good fish and chips, maybe a Guiness pot pie, and a couple more appetizers (Irish egg rolls?) and the menu will be perfect.  The true test for me regarding the beers was the IPA.  The IPA made the back of my tongue stand up and sing Handel's Messiah, so I was very happy.  The coffee stout was interesting, but I can't believe there's anyone out there who would find the Berliner Wheat Beer even drinkable.  Drop the Berliner and add a good Pilsner and you'll have a very nice selection of beer and food.  Combine that with the comfortable atmosphere, good music, and great service and you've got a real winner.  Regardless, I'll be coming back repeatedly.  To the person who made the comment that this is not Scottsdale, most of us are very glad of that."}
{"text":"Wow!!  Been some time since I have visited.  Wanted to grab a burger and beer.  Sat down in bar area and ignored for 10 minutes.  No one ever checked on me for anything.  Finally had enough after the 10 minute mark when 2 women sat down next to me and in less than 2 minutes waiter brought them water.  I won't be back - I will stick with San Tan Brewery.  In fact - I just sat down at San Tan and had service within 90 seconds of sitting down."}
{"text":"Mediocre beer at best. I was disgusted to see one of the owners with dip in his mouth while working behind the bar. Jon Taffer may have to rescue this place in the near future."}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night, and the wait for dinner was an hour and a half. We ended up finding a spot at the bar and ordered a flight and entrees at the bar. This place is definitely for IPA lovers, as they have quite the selection of IPAs. I ordered the pulled pork, which was delicious, just beware that the portions are huge. I had to waddle my out. The bartender was great and attentive. Had a great time!"}
{"text":"Love love love this brewery!!!! We have been trying a different spot every week, but this is the one that stuck. From their rotating beers on tap to their constantly changing menu, this place is a must go to!! What a great atmosphere to be around!"}
{"text":"Went for a friend's b-day. I think they limit you to ONE liter mug fill on your special day (with ID). Had the abbey dubbel which was SPECTACULAR!! The fries were great as I remember -- it's been a while since I've been in. The pulled pork with beer cheese fries may need salt and pepper, it did for me.  PRO-TIP: The Frenched wings usually have a small bone in there, so don't go tearing into them, be careful! There's also the normal end cartilage. PRO-TIP#2: Flights are $8 for 5 glasses. Great for sampling, sharing, and discussing with friends!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty nifty.  It is definitely not your ordinary brewery.  They have enough unique excitement on their menu to make me want to go back.  I had 2 glasses of the Juniper Mesa Black Ale, it was very good.  I see they are going to serving some interesting darker beers for the upcoming holidays, I will be back to try those!  We got 2 orders of their fries.  I thought they would be interesting what with the duck fat oil and beer cheese, but they kind of just tasted like ordinary french fries.    I got the peanut butter burger.  It was a new experience, but I was a little disappointed that the jalapeno jelly didn't have more of \"jalapeno-y\" spicy taste.  The Belgium waffle onion rings are awesome!  This place isn't a run-of-the-mill brewery, but it isn't a fancy hipster place either.  They find a good balance and they make me want to return.  And I shall!"}
{"text":"First of all, obviously  we all have bad service  once in a while. I personally  have never had such bad service  where I write a review. First review ever written right here and I'm 28.  So, sat down decided to order their wings with sweet and spicy sauce. Which were awesome.  They came out plain, without  sauce.  My gf  ordered her burger and the waiter asked if we were going to split it. We looked at each other decided we can eat a burger each and we declined the offer, I proceeded  to order my completely different burger on the menu.  The ginger teribble beard growing DC hat backward waiter brought  out 1 burger and an additional plate. WTF. It was not crowed.  So we aked him where the other burger was (as he had already  taken two completely  different  burger orders) and he admitted  he made a mistake.  So, being a gentleman  I waited 15 more minutes for the 2nd burger to come out before I start eating.  On top of that waiting  20 minutes for a refill  at a not busy brewery with 5 employees sitting at the bar on their phones is bull shit.  If I was rich I would  buy the place just to fire the staff.  Furthermore, the table in front of us also had their food delivered wrong, from a different  waiter...to top, it was our aniversary and it's the closest restaurant to us.  First and last time AZ Wilderness."}
{"text":"I love spending time at breweries and was really excited to finally try out Az wilderness.  The beer was okay, but I was disappointed by the cost and snobby ambiance.  They were chargin $20 to refill 64oz growlers with sub par beer (which certainly can be beat in taste by venturing to four peaks or san tan).  Thats like paying $20 for a five beers.  That is silly and  certainly not worth it considering they are not that special."}
{"text":"Great beer, amazing burger but service was slow and the wait an hour and a half. Will be coming back but probably only for weekday lunches until something changes with the wait situation. Otherwise a great spot and great patio."}
{"text":"This place has amazing brews and great food.  They use locally sourced ingredients and a lot of imagination when crafting their beers and the food is always top notch.  I couldn't decide between giving them four or five stars because the food is great and the beers are wonderful,  but sometimes the service isn't the best and I pray the hostess is going to be pleasant each visit - sometimes they are but more than half the time they aren't.  They are the first impression of the restaurant and often set a bad tone for diners - unless you are personal friends of the owners, because I've seen them interact very nicely with dudes who come in and go straight to the back for a chat.    I think you should come here and enjoy great beer and great food, and if you don't expect anything other than that, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!   The beer is always great and good is too.   Only negative is it gets busy if that's a negative!  This place a must do and will be a staple for Arizonans.  It is the best brewery in Arizona."}
{"text":"Excellent service and good food! I would recommend the PB&j burger with the duck fat fries."}
{"text":"Great beer. Fast service. Next-level burgers.  There's also meal options for those with more restricted diets.  The atmosphere is fantastic and I recommend the brewery to anyone looking for a great place to regular or just a spot to meet friends on the weekends."}
{"text":"Loud, noisy, busy, took over an hour to get \"fair\" food.  I just don't get why people like this place. I really wanted to since I am a Gilbert resident. Uh, no."}
{"text":"AZ Wilderness is changing the brew landscape in the Phoenix Valley.  I've been home brewing and seeking quality craft beer for more than 25 years.  Their food and beer offerings are unique and second to none.  These guys are the real deal!"}
{"text":"Top notch local brewery.  The beer selection cycles amazingly fast so consider getting a flight first.  I'm not a fan of sours but if that is your thing you have to drop by.   Food is surprisingly good.  I have not had to wait for seating but I try to avoid asking for a table in prime evening hours and if the weather is too bad to not use outside seating.  Atmosphere is good.  Have not had a bad experience during several visits."}
{"text":"Overall great experience.  The staff was amazing - everyone was so friendly.  The food was good and the beer was great.  Neat atmosphere too.  It was very busy but they handled the crowd very well.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Parking made it seem super busy on a Saturday night but we were seated immediately.  Service was good. Beer was just ok.  Took waitress recommendation and had the PB and Jalapeño Jelly burger,  and it was ok.  Others had the Reuben burger and didn't get the pastrami taste. Basically tasted like a burger with Swiss kraut and 1000 island.  Really wanted to love this place but it was just ok."}
{"text":"After hearing all the rave about this place I finally found myself on the same side of town. Went here for lunch the other day and it was super crowded so I guess business is doing well. The pretzel sticks and burger were amazing I have nothing but good things to say about the food. I went crazy and ordered the grapefruit beer which certainly requires an acquired taste. If I'm back in Gilbert and I'm hungry I would for sure go back."}
{"text":"Great Service at the bar! We had food and the beer sampler. Great prices also as the beer sampler was $8. My husband an I had a good time just drinking and eating our dinner."}
{"text":"The beer is different than your typical bar who has the usual Bud, Coors, etc.  I like the sour beers they have, since that it something you don't usually find elsewhere.  My husband loves their Refuge IPA.  I just wish that they would put the price and quantity (ounces) of each beer on the menu since they vary so drastically between beers.  One beer can be in the $3 range while another one can be in the $7 range and half the size, and you don't know it until the check comes."}
{"text":"Not all breweries are the same, this one in particular not only has good beer, but hands down the best onion rings I've ever had in my life and will continue to go here for that main reason. Please don't ever change, you're doing it right Arizona wilderness!"}
{"text":"Triple ipa, merica fries, after the hike burger, wife and baby boy.. Perfect Friday night!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for one of the best local breweries in the valley, look no further. They consistently knock beers out of the park and have a great rotating selection. Local food that is amazing and a rotating special? Again, look no further. I've been here  quite a few times and am always impressed by the food and special of the day. The owners are down to earth and super nice guys. I suggest you try this place out!"}
{"text":"Definitely deserving of a 5! If I could give more, I would. The staff is always beyond friendly, and always smiling. The food is delicious. I understand it's a brewery, so their focus is mainly beer and they NEVER disappoint. Can't wait for the 2nd location to open up in Gilbert."}
{"text":"This place is seriously incredible!!   The wait use to be really long (sometimes over an hour), especially during happy hour or on the weekends. It's since gotten better with the entire patio open for meals. However, I'd still expect to wait at least 15-20 minutes minimum during their peak times. That said, the food and beer is amazing!! I love the Hawaiian chicken burger the best, while my husband prefers the Good Morning burger. The servers are always great and the atmosphere is laid back. The one thing that could make this brewery even better is if they offered wine as well."}
{"text":"Per my husband, this brewery was absolutely amazing! I had one Citrus inspired beer which I thought was pretty good. Unfortunately, I do not have the appreciation or the acquired taste for beer therefore I can only go based on my husbands thoughts which were  already stated. He will certainly be coming back here again on our next trip to AZ."}
{"text":"Pros:   -- Really good food (bar food) -- Burgers are delicious  -- Vegetarian options for those such afflicted -- Delectable beers (obviously) -- Dog friendly patio  Cons:  -- Packed on peak hours / days -- Only one dessert option (but it's delicious)  Check this place out. You won't be disappointed. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Most disgusting restaurant I've experienced! My burger was EXTREMELY greasy I couldn't even eat! I was still hungry and the bun on the burger was very sweet I wanted to puke. The fries were BURNT to the max and very salty. And the waiter was greedy for money, expecting a 15 dollar tip. It was 35 dollars total for nasty cheap food. The ketchup tasted like marinara sauce and there was no soap in the bathroom to wash of the dripping grease. I wish I would've went back in time and go to Sonic to get a full course meal or McDonald's  because fast food is way better and less greasy then this place. It would cost 10 bucks for a good HEALTHIER meal at McDonald's compared to this place instead of 35 for cheap food. I hope people understand that this place is overrated."}
{"text":"I'm left wondering why I haven't been here any of the many times I come to Phoenix. Great beer and the bartender was super quick to get my flight. The restaurant side was packed, so if I'll have to try it next time.  I had a flight that included their 2 Gose beers and man, it's some good beer. I'm partial to salty/sour beers and their blood orange and grapefruit are two of the best I've had. Definitely coming back for some before heading home. Thanks for the great beer and service."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Good local brews featuring a good variety of flavors, and the food is amazing. Must try their duck fat fries, I like the poutin and the pork fries. The chicken wings are also a must have. Burgers are legit as well.    The theme is awesome, like a national forest. TVs feature beautiful Arizona scenery. The service is fast, and friendly. low key casual environment but great for a date night.  2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Mary was the best waitress in the world, the burger was outstanding, however the selection of ales was remiss in that they were all too fruity"}
{"text":"Great place for a local brew. They have GIANT vats of local beer brewing as WE SPEAK.   If you're into beer or other alcohol, this is the place for you. If you're an alcoholic or you don't drink, stay away.  The food is good for what it is. Nothing to write home about but it's definitely quality enough for a meal out with friends. Fairly inexpensive too.   The atmosphere is fairly good, lots of younger people and pretty indie. They have lots of cool wooden furniture and dim lighting. Definitely an interesting place and fairly close to a good friend of mine.   Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a real relaxed, Colorado/Oregon vibe, this is the spot. Plenty of seating and dog friendly patio so all friends can hang. I've never had a bad beer from here and the staff is always extremely friendly and welcoming. Huge plus for me for a brewery is really good food. The burgers here are DANK. They're super fat, super juicy, and pretty much everything you want in a burger and more. Also if you're not into the burger thing, their salads are great as well and they definitely don't skimp on the greens. I think everything is pretty reasonably priced as well for what you get. It's humble. Me gusta."}
{"text":"This place is the best. Does not compare to any other brewery I have been to. LOVE LOVE LOVE!"}
{"text":"Yum! The salad here is amazing! I am not a huge beer drinker but we loved the Bitterrecognize. The service was fast and our waitress was excellent. This is a great place for a drink and the food is equally delicious. I love the ambiance with beautiful pictures and camping stuff. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's famously been rated the number one new brewery in the world, and with good reason.  The beers are excellent (and well priced at around $5).  The food is great, the staff are friendly and knowledgable.  It's really hard to fault this place.  The patio is also a glorious place to enjoy the evening sun."}
{"text":"The Boys' Burger Club chose Arizona Wilderness Brewing Co. today. It did not disappoint. I will be having dreams tonight of the Trail Burger and duck fat fries that I just devoured."}
{"text":"Place is worth the wait! We had a party of 11 and had to wait about 45 minutes to be seated. There's misters outside and water if you're thirsty because you're waiting outside on their patio to be seated.  Inside there's bar seating and regular seating. They have TVs inside with sports games on as well.  I ordered the After the Hike burger--it has pork belly, an egg, avocado, onions, tomato, and lettuce. It was sooooooo good. The pork belly was tender, burger was cooked exactly how I asked, and it was juicy and full of flavor.   To top it off they've got a large selection of beer, fries and appetizers. Definitely don't think you can go wrong here!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! Everything is so well thought out and put together down to the merchandise they sell ( we own multiple shirts and hats)  I am always down to support local! Everything they offer is local to Arizona! Which I love.  The craft beer selection has grown quite a bit. The cans that they now sell some of their beer in have the coolest designs. I am not much a craft beer drinker but my fiancé is and this is by far his favorite brewery in AZ.  I am however a lover of pulled pork and BBQ sauce. I had the Hawaiian Pulled pork sandwich. So delicious! Beware the BBQ is spicy but sooooo good!  Can't remember the servers name but she was great as well! Chick with  some pretty sweet tats on her arm! Thanks we will be back!!  This place is a must try!! We come from north phx def worth the trip!"}
{"text":"AZ Wilderness is just a fun place to be.   What We Ordered:  Beer Flight of: Lemon Cucumber Ginger Gose, Farmer's Hands, White Canyon Blonde Stout, Tres Leches, and Ostreastoutus  1 Southwest Chicken Sandwich  1 Fruit & Nut Salad (unfortunately we received the Beet, Goat Cheese, and Apple salad instead, but embarrassingly enough didn't even realize it until afterwards)  Atmosphere: A It's really hard to not like the atmosphere at AZ Wilderness. Once before I stopped by here, and sat inside on their super cool, long community table. At the middle of it there is a giant tree trunk inside the building that goes from the floor all the way to the ceiling. That was a great spot - but this time we sat on their brand new (I think only 1 day old) east patio, and loved it! It just had a nice, brand new feel to it. The tables and booth benches were all wood, and hanging on all the sides of the fence were urban garden planters that added a really nice touch of greenery. AZW definitely pays attention to the details - there are many minor touches that make this place what it is.   Service: B- Our server was very personable and helped us with anything we needed, all while not checking back TOO often. Only reason I'm giving a B- for service, is due to the hiccups with our food order (which might not have even been our server's fault - it very well could have been the kitchen, or even the food runner who took the wrong food to us?)  Food: B- First off, I love the menu and the fact that they get many things from local businesses. Many of their food options sound really delicious, and from what I've had it mostly IS good. There are just a few minor details that I think could be improved on. The flavors in the chicken sandwich were great - what's not to like about pepperjack cheese, green chile, bacon, arugula, and chicken? Now, as mentioned above... we ordered the Fruit & Nut salad... and ate the whole thing... and didn't even realize until after we left that we actually received the Beet, Apple, and Goat Cheese salad. Kinda embarrassed with my lack of attention to detail. I was too busy checking out everything else and enjoying the beer I guess! With that said, the salad we got was just OK. Looking back, I really wish we had realized we had gotten the wrong salad while we were still there! (I also wish I could add in a laughing/crying emoji here)  Beer: A+ Here's where we start to get good. The beer was absolutely killer. We did a tasting flight (5 5oz pours) of the Lemon Cucumber Ginger Gose, Farmer's Hands, White Canyon Blonde Stout, Tres Leches, and the Ostreastoutus. I looooved them all. The Lemon Cucumber Ginger Gose was incredibly refreshing. I'm a sucker for goses, or anything with a touch of sour - this beer was bursting with citrus & cucumber, and also provided a bit of a tang with the ginger. Farmer's Hands was just a solid beer, with the perfect touch of (local) orange. The White Canyon Blonde Stout really reminded me of Sonoran's White Chocolate Ale, but not enough to call it a copy. It was fantastic in its own way. I was SUPER stoked to hear that AZW did a collab with Chris Bianco, as I'm a huge fan of his. The Tres Leches was perfect. It had a super wild (you like that word for this review?) flavor all around. I love the addition of the lactose in it, and the cinnamon and vanilla strangely give you a vanilla cola sort of aftertaste. I haven't had a beer like it.   Creativity: A+ Name a brewery with more creativity than the wilderness boys.   Overall I loved AZ Wilderness. Definitely would've been a 5-star review if not for the hiccups with our food, but I understand that happens. It's a restaurant and there's a lot of moving parts and things go wrong with food orders from time to time. The beer is stellar, and I can't wait to make it out there again sometime to see what else those dudes will brew up!"}
{"text":"Place never disappoints, food is always on point, servers are always attentive and friendly, and the beer is the best in the state, without any doubt at all. IPAs to sours, saisons to stouts these guys don't miss"}
{"text":"I'm a FAN!!!! Pulled pork sandwich is really good. I enjoyed the atmosphere too. There are different seating options, which make it a GREAT place to go with family and friends. I don't think anyone will be disappointed if they go. ENJOY!!!! I did!!!"}
{"text":"Refuge IPA is a 4 star easy drinking beer. Food is better than most pub grub.  Now really...please open up a \"Happy Hour\" menu for Saturday!"}
{"text":"First time going here and have to say really enjoyed the vibe of this place. The staff was very friendly and accommodating from the time we arrived to when we left. The restaurant is laid out nicely, like the tasting room for a spot while your waiting for a table. The patio alongside the building is a nice hangout spot while you wait as well. Love all the wood \"wilderness\" touch. Very rustic which I really enjoy for an atmosphere. Plenty of heat warmers for the winter and noticed misters for the summer. The back patio is where we sat which had a tall bar top with a nice fire pit in the center and a couple other fire pits for a larger group of people. Noticed this place is pet friendly which is very cool for the pet lover peeps out there. Only negative thing I can say is I didn't care too much for some of the music that was played.   We ordered the beer sampler which we enjoyed 4 out of the 5 beers we chose. We got the jalapeno meatloaf sliders which were DELISH along with duck fries which were also very delicious. My husband and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I arrived at the tail end of the Friday lunch crowd and found the brew pub absolutely packed with a 30-45 minute wait. Being on vacation with not much better to do, we just waited. The outdoor area was comfortable and well equipped to keep you feeling cool on a 95 degree day with ample seating, misters, awnings, fans and water stations. I'd love to meet whoever designed that and shake their hand because it's by far the best I've seen here in the southwest on the entire trip. My boyfriend- the craft beer nerd/expert/affictionado headed to the tap room to start sampling and it was a pretty hopping place as well. After about 30 minutes our (indoor) table was ready. Our server, who's name escapes me was very good and got our orders perfect. The menu is brew pub bar food gold. We had a sizable breakfast so appetizers weren't on the agenda despite sounding delicious. I got an After The Hike Burger which sounded incredible and did not disappoint! The duck fat frites were tasty too. My boyfriend got the  Good Mornin' Burger with waffle battered onion rings. Which was great too. Neither of us left anything behind. The beef was what made the burgers even better, you could tell it was high quality and made by people who enjoy food. The house made maple sciracha ketchup is to die for. I'd love some of that at home. The beer nerd enjoyed all four he sampled and even purchased some to enjoy later. Our rating 5/5."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge brewery beer fan and I loved every single beer in our flight. Also the proudly enjoyed all the outdoors/wilderness ambiance. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Was told the burgers here were outstanding. Tried one, it was really solid but the bread is kinda super plain. Really takes away from the taste, it's too bad. If it was a really great quality burger bun, the burgers here really would be amazing.  So lemme talk about the beer. I ordered a sour flight. 6 for $24 if I remember correctly. That's stupid expensive. And then I find out that all those beers, brewed right there at that location. Really? We're going to charge this much for beer we brew on location? So I was told they were aged sours which justified the price. No, no it doesn't. Again, brewed and most likely, aged at location. The sours were really good but for the price? Hell no, you're purposely gouging customers at this point because you can. Every other brewery I've every been to where they brew the beer there at location, practically gave away their beer. There's a lot less overhead cost when you brew the dang beer there. So I'm not coming back. Not for the food nor the overpriced beer."}
{"text":"We did a beer flight. The Refuge IPA and the Bear Wallow were stand outs. We were given a total of 8 beers to sample.  We also ordered the green chili pulled pork sliders. They were great. My only complaint is that the food is served on disposable tray. This is not Eco Friendly.  I would prefer to see reusable plates."}
{"text":"This place was crowded on a Saturday night but we got a seat on the misted patio pretty quickly nonetheless. The waitress was friendly and efficient. The peanut butter burger was good but the duck fat fries were flavorless and not very crispy. My husband really enjoyed his flight of beers which was also very affordable! I wish they had some wine on the list because I'm not a big beer person. Otherwise, fun spot, but the food could definitely be kicked up a notch."}
{"text":"PB and J Burger.  Jalapeno Jelly.  i ate one and was about to order another but my gluttony was   deprived.  The beer cheeze is great.  I recomend a side of this on your burger.  The all local products are great quality.  Staff is great.  The 5 beer sampler is great.  They have more beer options they will keep you coming back.  This is my once a week spot for sure.  I can't go too often, my wife will kill me."}
{"text":"Definitely good. American-style food with an upscale twist. I love that everything is homemade and fresh, but the overall result didn't leave me wanting more. I'm a traditionalist when it comes to french fries and these are seasoned with rosemary -- good, but not my fave. My coworker ordered the pulled pork -- I think she made the right choice."}
{"text":"Two words for you: Cannoli Nachos. Strange that first thing I think of is dessert at an amazing local brewery, right? Well they are that good. Try them and your life will be forever changed. But pair well with the right beer because it's just sad otherwise...you'll have to choose to either finish your beer quickly or wait on the nachos and that is a terrible decision to have to make. So think ahead.  I'm not a hops kinda girl but I've quite enjoyed their Spurs and their saisons. I follow their social media and I always get excited about what they have coming up.   Support local. Support the beards. Go to Arizona Wilderness! And buy yourself one of their new State Forty Eight shirts while you are there!"}
{"text":"I am completely obsessed with this place. First off, the atmosphere is awesome- there is patio space on both sides of the building, a tasting room, and an indoor area with a bar. Secondly, the beer they brew is amazing. Their taps are changing all the time and there is always something to please everyone- or just get a flight to try multiple ones. Thirdly, the food is excellent! Their burgers are to die for- I think they have the best burgers in town. Just typing this makes me crave one. I highly recommend coming here!!"}
{"text":"This continues to be a favorite of ours and warrants a detour any time we are staying in or passing through Phoenix.  They have expanded over the years but everything stays consistently great.  Service, food & beer are awesome!!"}
{"text":"This is our go to brewery/restaurant.  We have taken just about all of our visitors there (we're originally from MN) and have yet to have a bad experience.  They are always trying new things with their beers and most of them turn out amazing.  I would highly recommend getting a flight of beers your first time to figure out which ones you like best.  It's crazy how many beers I thought I wouldn't like based on the type of beer they are and then they end up being my favorite.    Their burgers are also really good.  I'm a vegetarian so I usually get the veggie burger with vegetarian fries (their normal fries are fried in duck fat) and love it.  My wife on the other hand eats meat and she has liked just about everything she's tried as well.    The service is just about always good.  They have a front patio with a bunch of heaters that will keep you warm while you eat in the winter and a fireplace in the back patio along with a table top fire pit.   They also have a tap room you can grab a beer at if you're waiting for a table."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Friendly atmosphere.  Only gave 4 stars bc 2 times I went they were out of the beer that I was hoping for and on weekends there is no way you are getting a table without waiting 30-35 mins."}
{"text":"Arizona Wilderness is becoming a weekly habit. Always good service, good food and AWESOME beer. I recommend this place if you are in the area. Beats anything else around!"}
{"text":"Perhaps my favorite new place in Arizona.  Even though I lived in Arizona for a long time and moved back to the Pacific Northwest, I travel to the Phoenix area regularly for work and am very glad I found Arizona Wilderness.  I haven yet to have a beer that disappointed me, and I highly recommend touring their line up on barrel aged beers.  I have been 3 times now and have done 5oz pours of each barrel aged beer and been very happy.  The food is excellent, and the duck fat fried french fries are outstanding."}
{"text":"Their Hawaiian pulled pork makes my mouth water just thinking about it. I'm gluten free and they dont have any drinks for me, which is the only downside."}
{"text":"Love this place! We've been here a few times and always get excited when we come back! There beer is always delicious and we love how it is always different & there food is beyond phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Deep, mature, creative beer list. 7/11 IPA with dragonfruit is unique and successful! Burgers are fine. They do wonderous things with beets in salads and more! Hip but welcoming. So popular they get a bit overwhelmed so pick times. A must for beerheads with excellent grub as well!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing and they have paired it with all the beer they have made.  I suggest getting the beer flight before settling on just one beer.  The new menu rocks!"}
{"text":"What great beer! Fantastic IPA. Food is just as good.  Only issue would be its busy all the time parking isn't the best but definitely a must go place"}
{"text":"I try and try to like this place... And I can't. Tonight was the end of trying. A 45 min wait for a table turned into 2 hours so we just left. What's even worst is the hostess ignored my friend when he went up there for the third time to check on our table. Literally acted as if he wasn't standing there. The food sucks, service sucks... Can only be a happy alcoholic if you love craft beer because guess what? No full bar. Bye bye Wilderness."}
{"text":"This place makes my heart happy. The service, the food, and the beers. Well, I don't drink the beers but my husband does and he loves them.   When they first opened they didn't have a kids menu but now have jumped onto the family friendly wagon which is GREAT.   Also, LOVE all the t-shirts and merchandise there. We have purchased several things to send to our family beer lovers out of state."}
{"text":"I really love the burgers here! And the fresh cut Duck fat fries to go along with it, it's the most delicious burgers I've had in a long time. The Arizona trail burger is where's it's at. I'll be trying different ones as I go along. My gf really loves the vegan tacos. They come with cheese so ask them to hold the cheese if you're vegan. The duck fat fries also come vegetarian. Drinks look really good here too!"}
{"text":"I'm super picky about my meat and this being a place that really only serves ground meat I was  apprehensive. I must say the chicken burger I got was amazing! It was the best tasting one I have ever had! They cooked it and even listened to how I liked it! The craft beers are delish as well! We went here for a friends birthday party and they did a great job with service and food. I was impressed."}
{"text":"Delicious food and a wide selection of local beers. They support local and have my vote of confidence"}
{"text":"Very cool place!! Amazing selection of alcoholic beverages!!! Food is amazing and the menus are extensive. Went here in the winter and they have fire pits on some of the patio areas! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Great place! Refuge is my beer of choice here.  And all the food I've had is solid.  I love the Jalapeno meatloaf sliders on the pretzel buns,  also the green chile pulled pork sliders.   The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is the duck fat fries, I like my fries really crispy & these are def not crisp.   But everyone else seems to like them...so maybe it's just me.    Great staff!"}
{"text":"Interesting  place! I came here years ago and tried my first sour.  Not a good experience.  Fast forward years later,  this place is solid.  Great food.  Great service. Their beers are worthy of bringing home. You won't go wrong coming here for food or drink.  I came almost every time I  the Phoenix metro ."}
{"text":"Without a doubt this is the best place to get beer in the Phoenix area. They make fantastic beer that you will not find anywhere else in Arizona.  When we stop in there is always something delicious to try or something on the way to get you coming back.  The staff here are exceptional.  They make you feel right at home and are always friendly and  willing to explain the beers and talk about all the fun and exciting things they are working on.  They have a simple menu of things on a bun ( chicken, pulled pork, burgers or veggie burger ), but it hits the spot with an ice cold hand crafted beer.  I will go on record to say they have the best Black Bean veggie burger in the area. It's actually freshly made, no frozen garden burgers to be found.  All of the beer establishments and restaurants should take note on how to have a great place that you want to come back too.  Try:  - Signal Mountain Stout - Woosley Wit - Beer - Veggie Burger with Mushrooms and Beer Cheese - Veggie Burger with Green Chile, Cheddar, and BBQ sauce"}
{"text":"My husband and I are not beer drinkers we came here for the food and we weren't disappointed. Our burgers were full of flavors and definitely not dry. Everything was good from the appetizer to the entrees. And the staff was great they answered our questions, made us feel welcome and checked on us frequently. Would definitely come back whenever we're in the area."}
{"text":"This place is way over rated. It was great when it first opened up to stop by and have a beer, but now it's transformed into something it shouldn't have. I went here recently on a Friday night just to have a beer with some friends and we pulled in to find half the lot was reserved for valet parking... Which is ridiculous. And we were told it would be a 45-60 minute wait, the homestead so gracefully let us know that that's a \"good\" wait time because before it was a 90 minute wait. This place is so not worth a wait in my opinion."}
{"text":"Get the Arizona trail burger. That sweet n spicy sauce is incredible. The brisket burger was perfectly cooked. Pretzel bun just adds to it. The only thing is it's a little pricey for what amounts to what seemed like a 6oz. burger."}
{"text":"Really liked the both IPAs they had , and my husband had one I think was called rguy or something that was good.  We had pretzels to munch on for appetizers and those were good.  The service and atmosphere were good.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great, unique beers ever changing through the taps. Solid food and servers have always been friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"They don't have any beer stylesI like, music too loud and occasionally play an obscene rapper! Fryer and grill were broken. I had hummus which was good but the service was so slow we almost left.  My husband ate grilled cheese and salad. One of the few items they could serve today. The salad looked good. The sandwich didn't look good at all. Looked soggy and not cheesy."}
{"text":"If you are looking for something different. Not your typical same ol' same ol' brewery, this is your place! They are unconventional yet very traditional when it comes to recipes and styles. They change out beers all the time trying new things. I've not had a beer I don't like and I've tried them all! If you don't know, get the sample tray! If you are worried that their beer isn't hoppy enough for you, I know one of the owners, they have hundreds of recipes they are planning to roll out over the next year. So if you haven't found your favorite, be patient! The food menu is simple and the food is good. The staff is friendly and very knowledgeable  about beers as most, if not all came from other brew houses. Lastly I will say that this last time I was here, mid day on a Saturday, packed! Not and empty table! The only negative would be that I think they need more table servers."}
{"text":"Everyone keeps recommending this place so we decided to try it....what a let down. The place was cool looking but that's it.   I'm not a beer girl but my hubby who home brews LOVES local beer. He did a flight and was not impressed by any of them.   I agree with other reviews that the burgers are really pricey and not that great. Neither burger we ate had much seasoning and it was soggy with grease making the bun soggy - ewe. The fries and onion rings were the only decent things we ate. Definitely way too pricey for such mediocre food and beer.   There are plenty other breweries around the area who's food and beer is so much better and less money, we won't be here again."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night and waited about 15 minutes to get sat. Went to the bar and ordered a flight, but the time we got the beers our table was ready.  That's cool.  A bit of a shuffle around and we were seated outside under the comfy heater.  We worked our way through our flight.  Each beer we had was different and unique.  I don't think I walked away with any one that stood out to me.  But they were all a solid 3 out of 5 stars.  Good beers.  Don't need to rush back for any one of them.  Though we only tried five, we did hit five different styles and feel like we got a good idea of what they were about.  For sure more west coast inspired with lots of Simcoe, Citra, Cascade, Galaxy, etc.  I live on the West Coast and when I leave like to feel like the beer has changed and represents where I am visiting, and this felt like a standard California place.  Which is good, in that I think they hit the mark they were aiming for, it's just that I wanted to get a bit more of a feel for a SW style brewery.  We did order the frenched chicken wings.  They were dry and salty.  Too bad.  I love chicken wings but ate one and I think I was over it.  The service was great and the music was spot on. The menu is nice and varied and there were several items I would have probably tried if I was more hungry, but we just wanted to nibble.  I think we would have been better off with fries or something.  We did get a pint glass, which was an astronomical $16!!!  I would never pay that much for a pint glass, no matter if it was going out of production or not.  So...be warned, next time ask ahead of time how much they are...just insane.  Well at least it'll make for a good story."}
{"text":"Food was just okay. The fries were a little over cooked and the ketchup tasted gross. Hamburger was extra messy and the service was not that good. I ordered two hamburgers was charged extra for beef extra for bacon and thought I would try a beer. After all was said and done me and my wife spent over $40 bucks. Nothing against the place just not worth it!"}
{"text":"The service was a bit slow here but the food and beers are top notch. They have a lot of unique options on the menu and everything we've had has been amazing. The beer cheese pretzels are must! They have flight for tasting or you and seasonal options as well. I loved the vibe and had both I door and outdoor seating. Awesome place if you don't mind a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"Great unique burgers and fantastic beer. If u have a educated pallet for beer come give this micro brew a try. My fav was the IPA."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! Every time I go, I am never ever let down at how delicious the food is and I love the beer. It's a cool, casual, and fun atmosphere with a few options of where you want to sit.   My favorite thing to order is the pulled pork sandwich- soo good!  Just go, enjoy your time with friends and family, and you can thank me later."}
{"text":"Got there before noon on Sunday and got a seat, it quickly filled up for lunch.   I got the Sunday special sandwich, the exact ingredients elude me, but it had roasted chiles, shaved turkey, and a bunch of other delicious toppings (See picture). The chips it came with were average, a little too fried for my taste. We got the duck fat fries, my first time having them, I was expecting some exceptional and different flavor, they just tasted like good fries, nothing different.   I'm not a beer connoisseur, we had samples of a bunch of their beers and didn't like any of them. The descriptions were great and I applaud them for their adventurous pairings, but I was not a fan, no one in my party was. If you're looking for some different beer, this is a good place for you.   Baby note: We sat inside, before the crowd the noise level was fine. Once it got busy, it was a little loud for my 5 month old. There is enough room inside to maneuver a stroller."}
{"text":"Is this really the 1000th review of Arizona Wilderness? Well let's make it a good one :) I really can't say enough good things about this place - the staff is always friendly and awesome, and they are super dog friendly! They have a huge patio with heaters and little fire pits for the few weeks of winter that we get here in AZ, and misters for the rest of the year. I'm a huge fan of IPAs, and their Refuge IPA is a staple for me. I recently tried their Java Lupulus, which incorporates coffee from the amazing Peixoto Roasters in Chandler, and it was absolutely delicious. I love their beer flights, which come in half logs with cutouts for their goblets. You get 5 generous pours for $10, which is a steal!   If you feel like consuming a few days worth of calories in a single sitting, their After the Hike burger is one of the most amazing burgers I've ever had. The thick beef patty is cooked perfectly to order, and topped with bacon, pulled pork, avocado, white cheddar, an onion ring, and a fried egg! Holy artery clogging heaven! To take it a step further, I'd highly recommend substituting their famous duck fat fries as your side and asking for a side of their garlic aioli. Your body might hate you later, but your taste buds will be singing your praises."}
{"text":"Second time I have been here in 2 days! Both times were amazing! Tacos are out of this world! Artichoke dip is to die for! Beer choices are great, food is fabulous and service and atmosphere is great!!"}
{"text":"As you can see from my Yelp page... I dine out a lot.   And I dine out all over the country.   You can also see that I don't write many reviews.   But this establishment is totally worthy of a review.   The atmosphere was amazing.   The service was even better.  And to top it off... In my 36 years on this planet I am comfortable saying that they served me the best burger that I have ever eaten.   Peanut butter and jalapeño jelly ground brisket burger.  Need I say more?  Foodie friends, please do yourself a favor and try it once.   You will be hooked.   I certainly am."}
{"text":"Has a Flagstaff microbrewery vibe. Bustling with energy,  flights of microbrews, and men with beards. The burgers were fresh and tasty. It's really loud though."}
{"text":"The best brewery in AZ. Highly recommend the Reuben Burger. Our office recently ordered lunch over the phone. The staff was friendly, They were quick to complete the order, and everything we ordered was there. Happy employees, happy review, we will be back."}
{"text":"What is the same from my first review?    - They still have excellent brews and they love to experiment to always keep you interested.  - They still get slammed frequently - go on off hours - Their food is still damn good  What has changed: - They have an outdoor area including a tasting room - They changed the way their doors work.  Get in through the outdoor patio area - They now keep up with demand and always have several great brews to choose from - They have misters and shade in the outdoor area including a tasting room.  Thanks due to the bagel place going under that they were attached to. - Their men's bathroom is entering \"dive bar\" territory.  Not quite Trainspotting but getting close. - They now have a group of hostesses that are quite frankly horrible.  Not only are they unfriendly but they could easily run the place about 30% more efficient than they do.  We got yelled at for sitting at an outdoor table with other people (who were already seated) three times.  Here is a tip ladies - let the biergarten flow.  Allow the outside area to be first come first serve. It will encourage people to sit with strangers which is good for the vibe.  Control the inside tables only because it is obvious you cannot do both.  I've never seen so many people get yelled at while tables sat empty for over an hour.  If you are trying to slow the place down so service can catch up there are better ways to do that.    Last up is the tasting room service.  The line moves slower than pond water and there is usually one person in there solo.  This is not good and I feel so bad for the poor guy trying to score a quick growler and go home.  Get a person to pour tasters, one to take cash/credit, and the other to deal with a SEPARATE growler line.  These are profitable sales (growlers) that don't take up space in your busy restaurant area so you should encourage them."}
{"text":"The beards have done it! This place is a cozy as a cabin, clean as an operating room, and as busy as the grocery store the day before thanksgiving!  There are about 5 craft beers on tap right now, giving plenty of options to find your favorite. Do yourself a favor, grab a sampler, a bite to eat and take your time picking a favorite. The food menu is short with just the essentials right now, but has intention to grow. The Belgium fries cooked in duck fat w/rosemary are decadent. The burger made with 70% brisket is juicy, flavorful and perfect. The house-made BBQ sauce infused with Red Rock Secret Ale is a tasty addition.   So happy to have this in my 'hood and will certainly be a regular. Get your growlers ready, Gilbert!!"}
{"text":"I'd come back here for a few reasons. ... A. The staff,  waiter and host, we're very helpful, quick and accommodating with everything B. The burgers we ordered were huge and very very tasty, not to mention I adored the duck fat fries and I'm not a big fry person (I'll rarely order them)..my son really enjoyed his kids quesadilla. C. You'd never think this place was family friendly but there were plenty of families,  just like us, so it was comfortable to have my 2yo with us and he attracted no unwarranted attention being loud, walking loose, messy, etc. D. If i weren't preggo, I'd have enjoyed the Tasting Room and the list of tasty on tap beers they had.   Well def come again another time."}
{"text":"Duck fat fries, great burgers and they support local breweries. What's not to like? They have a very relaxed environment. Great place to go for a date or just a casual lunch/dinner with friends."}
{"text":"The beer is outstanding and the food is well prepared.  The confit chicken wings take bar food to a whole new level, they are finger licking good!  This was the second time I've tried one of the burgers and was equally impressed as the first.  We thought we arrived early enough on a Saturday (11:00 AM) but the place was already packed.  It makes sense because not only are the servers friendly but the patrons all couldn't be anymore happy-go-lucky.  Don't be fooled by the location, this place is more than worthy of a visit if one is hesitant about traveling to Gilbert.  Let's just say I have one more great Arizona brewery to add to the rotation."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I took my mother and grandmother here for Mothers Day for dinner. We were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away. Our waitress was very patient with our questions and was attentive, service was quick. I don't understand some of the bad reviews I've seen on here, the food was to die for! And every beer we tried on the flight was great, too. Only thing that could make this place better would be a full bar - I know it's a brewery but many others have implemented full bars. Either way, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really like this place! Opted for the beer bacon and bleu burger cooked at medium but it was a very rare medium. I was starving so didn't bother to send it back. The place for very crowded on a weekday just after opening. Service was good. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The pork on pork was delicious!  Pulled pork with bacon on top. The beer were all delicious. Especially the blonde stout and the IPA. Of course the duck fat fries were delicious. We say outside on the patio and it was lovely!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this brewery! Great beer and really good food! I appreciate the great service and the casual environment. There is a small selection of beer on tap and they can run out at times, but they always have something I like.  I really appreciate that this is a local business using resources from other local businesses. This place only opened a year ago...and I'm excited to see how the business grows."}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  Try the burger with peanut butter and jalapeño jelly. sounds strange but it's goid. The beer isn't that great."}
{"text":"I think so far I am indifferent on this place.  Let's start with parking. There is none. Yes, there is the \"free\" valet - which I really dislike - not because I am opposed to it, but because I rarely have cash on me anymore and having to tip becomes a huge exercise in having to get cash because I don't have any and then making sure I break the cash so I am have a correct amount to tip... but I digress - this is a problem at a lot of different places here in the valley and to be honest, it becomes a deterrent for me and my friends.  We sat on the patio on the west side of the building. It is really sunny. As the patio faces east/west - we were there at sunset and the sun is right in my eyes - there is nothing on the west side to block the sun.   Food - well we only ordered the artichoke dip. And I will give that 5 stars. Very delicious. Liked it a lot. However, I hear that the food is great and so I would be willing to give that a chance as well.  Beer - I am pretty indifferent. First, I am not a huge IPA fan. And almost everything is an IPA or Saison. They were out of the HIbiscus Gose while here, so that was out. I did the sampler of 5 saisons - and I have to say there really wasn't one that I would want to drink again. The No Ticky No Taco was definitely interesting with the cumin accents - but I am not sure this is something I would want to drink a pint or more of.  The De La Ferme - nothing to be excited about Salome Saison - ok - I don't really have anything to say about it either. Woolesy Wit - has a slight orange flavor - but more tart than I was expecting.   I would like to try the dubbel - as it sounds interesting. But I would have to say for my tastes, I haven't really found one that I could say I would order each time I come here if and when I come back. As of now, I am impartial.   Oh - and they only have beer. I had a friend with me who doesn't like beer - and there is no wine option. I understand this is usually a licensing issue - but I thought the beer and wine license were together? Anyway - maybe I will try again soon."}
{"text":"I've been to AZ wilderness a number of times now and have had an awesome experience every time. The staff is friendly and efficient. The food is fresh, locally sourced, tasty, and very affordable. Lastly, the beer is top notch and ever changing. The flights are a great deal and since their beer changes so much we always get to try something new. Whenever we are in town, we make it a point to stop into AZ Wilderness, we've even gone out of our way to come here! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Holy smokes, my friend took me here they have the best IPA I've ever had and their beer cheese oooohhhh!!! And the smell of the duck fat fries smells like turkey dinner. So so good, I will be back"}
{"text":"Unquestionably a 5-star experience for me and the friends and family who have visited. 5 stars for beer, food, environment, and service. It can't be denied that these guys know how to put together excellent, interesting beer. The taps vary based on what they've brewed.  I've never seen anything other than their own beers, as it should be here. Their IPA (which is great, by the way) is the only one that is always on tap. Which is why I don't order it - because I already know I like it, so I'd rather try their new creations (or ones that I missed before and are reappearing). From the lighter wheats and saisons to the gratzers, porters, stouts, and barrel-aged concoctions, I say try them all. Beer lovers paradise for sure. They now have a tasting room with even more taps, including some that aren't served in the restaurant side.   For food, they've taken the time to create a simple, quality menu. I've tried 3 different chicken sandwiches, duck fat fries, pretzels (with heavenly beer cheese) - all high quality. I can't recall anyone being unhappy with any of the food and have only heard compliments. Surprisingly good for a place that is so focused on the beer.   Service has always been good for us, and we've always been impressed with beer knowledge (especially the bartenders, obviously). Expect a long wait to during prime times, even with the extra space. Or go early.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Great little brew pub. Excellent beers, and great food. The wings and green chile pork sliders are great. Very electric atmosphere. Will definately return next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Amazing beers that rotate a must for those interested in original craft beers! Food is pretty on point as well!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all, burger was really tasty but a little too much bun for me .. I like the beer selection and overall it was a nice environment"}
{"text":"Beer is awesome, with award winning brews and fries with duckfat. Beer garden atmosphere catered towards younger crowd that likes barnwood, herb boxes and taking photos from the trail. As a parent I appreciate the staff for always putting us in parts of the bar way from the bar itself and usually get a booth or somewhere outside. Food is varied and upscale ingredient wise. Salads are all on point and recommend adding the chicken breast..  When they are busy be prepared to wait but grab a beer in the tasting room and realize sometimes you have to wait for good food in the East Valley. A bright spot for sure."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their fries! Try the ones that come with brisket and beer cheese! Their beers are all delightful. The atmosphere is fun and laid back. Try it out on a Sunday morning!"}
{"text":"Always a great treat to be here. Food is amazing. My favorite is the pulled pork green chili sliders but any food you get will tasty. They have specials every day of the week. Taco Tuesday is a fav for most. Makin bacon Thursday was tonight and boy what a treat. Candied Jalapeño and Bacon Pancakes!   As they are a microbrewery and have a small selection of beers on tap. Always a great seasonal selection to match their amazing food."}
{"text":"I visited AZ Wilderness on 3/3/18, for their MS Society give back day.  The team was friendly and efficient, the beer was very good, and the food yummy!!  I highly recommend this place!!!  I will go back because of what's mentioned above, and because of their dedication to the fight against multiple sclerosis."}
{"text":"Good burgers. Unique food options. Good beer selection. Great service. Only thing they might do is turn the fans down at night as it was a little cool inside. Not a big deal. I'd definitely got back."}
{"text":"great beer, really good food and very good service. The server was attentive without being pushy- which is important to me. Only suggestion is that they have an alternate to their siracha maple ketchup."}
{"text":"Seat outside!! Service is on point! Our server helped us out a lot to find out the beers they brew and the way to do the flights! I will be back; next time I'll try the foods!"}
{"text":"Well folks, I've been waiting for this brewery to open for quite some time. And WOW have they done it. From the wonderfully AZ wilderness inspired decor, to a friendly staff and then the beer. And oh is the beer ever good. Starting today their hours will be 11am-midnight 7 days a week. Head over and enjoy a beer and some good conversation. What an awesome place. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Awesome beer and good food. Nice ambiance. Try this place you won't be disappointed. Staff was great as well."}
{"text":"I love me some Wilderness. Always a great selection of (usually very interesting) beers to try, though I find myself sticking with Refuge as my go-to choice more often than not (pause while I envision how nice it would be to have one sitting in front of me right now). They also offer some prettttty tasty burgers. All kinds, and some really fun ones. You can't really go wrong with any of the burgers, though of the ones I have tried, I'd recommend the Mushroom n Beer Cheese Burger, Peanut Butter & Jalapeño Jelly Burger (I thought it sounded suspect too, but I swear it works), and Apple & Brie Burger, or the After the Hike Burger. Their fries are tasty, I usually get the Belgische frietjes. Cautionary note - if you are going to opt for the 'Merica fries or the Flyin Belgian Pig fries as stand-alone nosh items, be sure you are not alone. These puppies are tough work even for two with the large portions. Basically I can only comment on the beer and fries, food wise. So good I haven't been able to order anything else. The atmosphere is pretty laid back - a little fancier inside with a lot of high top tables and bar space. I prefer outside, and the lovely, more casual patio with long picnic-style tables, misters, umbrellas. I just think it has a better feel, and with the long tables you can make new friends by sharing a table with strangers (which has paid off more often than not in my experience). I once met three pilots from Sweden who were in America accruing flight school hours - true story. Servers are friendly and I haven't ever had a bad experience there. The one complaint I have is the parking. There just isn't enough. So you are either beyond overjoyed you got a spot and can commence imbibing some of the best beer the valley has to offer, or you are frustrated as hell at the parking gods while you drive by the extremely enticing patio, watching everyone enjoy the gift of fine beer and delish burgers you WERE about to receive. Please don't change. Except maybe the parking situation, that I'd be okay with. P.S. dogs are welcome on the patio, which is just one more reason for 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great beer, very tasty food, casual comfortable atmosphere. Not sure what more to say. It's a great place for foodies even if you don't drink. I eat here about once every other week and always recruit newbies to join, everyone is always impressed and they now frequent AWBC. Must have the pretzels!!"}
{"text":"The food has definitely improved since my first visit and my friend and I have found a few things we like on the menu.   the menu skews towards annoying gastro-pub pretentious but there is something for everyone's taste.  There aren't many session beers on the menu, so have your Uber app installed if before you go.  The rye beer is very drinkable and 2 won't get you a DWI."}
{"text":"This place was just ok. Duck dat fries were too burnt and tiny small pieces like at the bottom of the bag. Artichoke dip was sour tasting. Beer was ok- I had watermelon one that's new and I didn't really think it was spectacular. The hostess was also rude about seating at smaller and taller tables. Not likely to go back really. Sub par is my opinion."}
{"text":"Total hipster place. In my world these are the most exotic beers I've ever had. The staff was great and very patient with me until I found something I liked. They had some live music going and the place was packed.  I only had time for one beer as I was going to dinner and needed to kill some time. If you want to try some really unique beers in a nice setting this is your place. If you don't venture out past mass produced American beers this is not your place.  All-in-all it was an interesting and educational stop and I'm glad to say I've tried it."}
{"text":"We had dinner @ the AZ Wilderness Brewing restaurant last night.  The beer & food were great - and Bryce's service was awesome too!  AZ Wilderness has a nice patio area with misters - so you can dine outdoors even while the temperature rises :)"}
{"text":"Best brewery food I've ever had, hands down.    The service is impeccable.   They've got a really special thing going on here.   Their duck fat fries are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Great craft beer. And three different kinds of french fries how can you ask for more? Great place lots of outdoor seating wish I could drink and drive I'd come here more often. But it's on the bus line!"}
{"text":"Arizona Wilderness has a great selection of food and a wide variety of beers!  I'm always impressed by all they do for the National MS Society and the donations provided to the Bike MS event.  I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here to try the different beers they brew. I wish they would keep a few as a constant and then rotate the others. I wasn't to impressed with the food or the selection."}
{"text":"FIRST OFF: This place is usually PACKED due to all the rave reviews they've been getting, so plan on waiting 15-30 mins for a table during normal eating hours unless you're alone and somehow find a seat at the bar.  The beer is good but I haven't found one there that I've loved yet.  Only 4-5 on tap at any time, but they are all brewed in-house.  No liquor behind the bar, so don't plan on getting a cocktail.  The food is GREAT.  The Frenched wings are the best chicken wings I've had anywhere--we get these 80% of the time now.  Extremely tasty and fall right off the bone.  All of the sauces are great.   AZ Trail Burger also VERY good--brisket patties.   French fries cooked in duck fat also very tasty."}
{"text":"The food AND beer selection is diverse and tasty. It can get pretty busy on weekends but its worth it."}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday night and it was jam packed. We had a hard time even figuring out where the hostess stand was to start with - she's in the middle of the patio which is a little weird. Then she told us there was a 30 minute wait, when we had just walked through the restaurant trying to find her, and there were obviously empty tables - plus some just next to her on the patio. Apparently they can't/don't serve food at the last 6 tables on the patio, but \"the bar has open seating\" so we found 3 seats there. My mom and I both got the burgers and were impressed, and my fiance got the flying pig fries and he really liked them. He also had a few beers including one that tasted like it could have been a lemon hard cider - very interesting but also incredibly strong of taste. If this place is that crowded on a Thursday night, I doubt I'd try to come here on a weekend night."}
{"text":"If you wants great burger this is the place.  Be sure to get the pretzel bun!!  Servers are very attentive but two in our party had slight errors in their order.   It is VERY NOISY.  Hard to carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"Wow, went there tonight, thinking my wife and I would enjoy a little night out. Yeah it's the playoffs, but it's a Friday night at 9:15. We find a place to park. As we walk up, we notice the place looks busy, but not full. We go up to put our names in, an hour and forty five minute wait.... Holy S$@T!!!! I don't think I've ever had anyone tell me that before. My wife looked at me, and we walked away. Once back in the truck, she looks at me again, and says, \"I can't believe she could say that with a straight face...\". Needless to say, not happy. We ended up going to downtown Gilbert, even on the busiest of nights in downtown, we wouldn't have to wait that long. I don't know what on earth could be done about that, but dang.  I'm sorry we can't review the service beyond the hostess, or the food, we didn't want to wait almost 2 hours to eat. Not sure if we will go to try this place after tonight....."}
{"text":"Been hearing great things and went there yesterday for the first time.  I was blown away.  You can tell that the staff and owners take pride and care in what they are doing.  The beer was fantastic, crafted with a lot of thought and creativity.  Loved the Superstition Coffee Stout, and I love that they support other local business like Superstition Coffee.  The food menu was perfect and they are focusing in on doing a few things very well.  The burger I had was delicious and the duck fat fries where a perfect compliment.  All in all, this is the kind of relaxing and cool place that I could hang out all day in and work.  In fact...I think I might start hanging out here all day with my laptop to work :)    Great job guys, keep it up!  You've made a regular out of me."}
{"text":"Wilderness expanded and has much more seating indoor and outdoors so your wait is less than before.  But this place is popular and you will still wait.  They used to have games my family enjoyed playing but removed those after the Renovation. Bummer about that because the kids aren't as willing to go now. Yes- we take kids to a brewery. Stop judging!   They like the veggie tacos and vegetarian fries (minus the duck fat). We aren't vegetarian so we order the something pig fries. Stop the madness- I crave these things! It's fries with pulled pork and melted beer cheese. So good! And super healthy. Ha!  The beer is hit or miss for me. We usually get a flight and I will find one I like enough for a full beer. I prefer creamy beers, wheat beers, or something lighter. My husband will drink dark, IPA, etc. so he finds more he likes than I do. The beer is heavy on the hoppy or sour. However, they rotate all the time so you will generally find something you will like.  I love that they use local ingredients and the patio is dog friendly.  A Gilbert gem!"}
{"text":"We have gone to AZ Wilderness since they opened. It's a great local spot and we LOVE all the beer choices. I am a huge sour fan and love that this is always on the menu. Now that the weather is cooling off we can't wait to hang out on one of their patios and enjoy some pretzels and craft beers."}
{"text":"2nd visit:  Sunday afternoon following a Cactus League game @ Hohokam. Party of 5.  Seated within 20 minutes even though the place is hopping.  Interesting beers. AWESOME burgers! Decent, above average service.   Cool place w/ misters on the patio. Nice sized parking lot.  Really creative burger selections."}
{"text":"We were a group of 4.  Noise level was intolerable.  Brews OK but not spectacular.  Out of 8, we liked 4.  Great burgers and fries.  Did I say the noise level was intolerable?  We ate, drank and left.  No reason to return."}
{"text":"First time here and don't think I'll be back. My meal was great, the beer was alright, and the service was just a mess. And the place wasn't busy enough to explain away the poor service.  The good? I had the Hawaiian burger and it was delicious. The homemade potato chips were tasty and the onion rings were fantastic. Everyone else at the table enjoyed their meals, too. The beer was just alright. I only had one, the Santa Teresa, and it was pretty good. Not impressed by the minimal selection, though.  The bad? The service. Everyone was friendly enough, sure. But the service started poor and kept getting worse. Seven of us at the table and we ordered a round of beer. Five of us get their drinks. Two of us get nothing. A long while later, the server comes back around to see if we all are ready for another round. I say, \"maybe, but I'd have to get a first round before I can have a second.\" She's completely surprised that two of us don't have our beers and off she goes to find out what happened. A while later she returns to tell us that \"the keg was kicked,\" they are out of what we ordered, and we need to choose something else. Fine. We do. And a while later, our two beers finally come out.  I'll skip all the other details and get right to the WTF moments. Our checks come and I see that I have been charged for my burger and my beer PLUS the beer that never came because they were out. My friend was also charged for her never-got-it beer. And our other friend was charged twice for her order of sliders. Why? Because she ordered them without cheese, they came with cheese, the staff apologized and remade them, then charged her for both orders, anyway.  When I told the server about the errors on three of the checks, she said, \"thanks for checking, that's exactly what I need you to do.\" She walked away before I could say, \"um, no, that's what YOU are supposed to do.\"  Again, everyone there was friendly and nice enough. But the long delays for the server to get to our table, the multiple problems with our orders, and three of us being overcharged on our tickets all make me think that I won't be coming back.  There are too many other great choices for restaurants in town. I'll go back to the places that pay attention to the details."}
{"text":"We ordered burgers and two flights of beer. The food was good and the craft beers were fun to try. I'm not an IPA fan so we steered clear of those.  The dark beers were my favorite and went well with the burgers."}
{"text":"Hype is a double edged sword: deliver and it's awesome, fail and be flayed upon the rack of public opinion.  I've heard great things so I was super excited when given the opportunity, call it a pilgrimage, to try it for myself...and it was ok.  Maybe my expectations were too high, maybe I bought into the hype.    But it was ok.  Not bad, just ok.  Having eaten dinner earlier we tried opted for appetizers and dessert: the pretzel sticks and cannoli nachos.  The nachos were one of the most unique desserts I've had, crunchy, sweet, creamy in a great SW-style presentation and the pretzels were everything a pretzel should be:  soft, chewy, salty with a salty cheese sauce and house-made mustard.  The beer flight was ok as well.  As my wife later remarked \"it seemed 'underdone' like they weren't finished quite yet.\"  Granted the Pusch Ridge Porter and Oak-n-Ordinary Bitter were actually quite good, the others were fair to middling (although that could be my taste buds).  Two things really bothered me though.  First, a distinct lack of vegetarian options.  I like to have fries with my beers but duck fat cooked fries doesn't really work, and I think we ordered the only two non-meat options on the menu.  Second, the ticket was a surprise since only the food prices were posted, none of the beer prices were.  I don't like surprises like that.  One great thing though was that I had to call the next day since my wife experienced an allergic reaction to something she ate and I was trying to track down ingredients and the staff was very helpful, even apologetic (nothing they could've done since we didn't know ourselves) and helped us figure out was may have caused it.  Would I go back?  Probably, but I won't be making a pilgrimage to do so."}
{"text":"We had excellent service, amazing food, and great beer! The burgers were delicious. We went for my husband's birthday and they gave him a huge mug of beer for free. You gotta love that!"}
{"text":"Just paid another visit to this brewery and I have to say it was a good one they have improved greatly in a few months (maybe trying to live up to their award for best new brewery)   The first time i visited the beers were just ok, too hoppy and kind of generic for my taste and the only good one was the Sour Wheat beer (unique, refreshing and very light alcohol). I liked the chill kinda vibe and the outdoor theme. Gotta love the bearded brewers :-)  This round i tried the coffee stout, the Sour wheat (called BWBW i believe) and  Dark ale. Seems they always have 6 on tap the others were IPA style so not for me. The coffee stout is one of the best i have ever had, so smooth and creamy and great flavor, it does have coffee in it so i should only try these earlier in the day :-). The others we very tasty as well and have now changed my opinion on this place (before it was barely a 3 star).  I tried the rosemary fries cooked in duck fat and they were yummy, still need to go back and try the food.  It was busy around happy hour but manageable (early in the week anyways) and our server was good and knowledgeable.   Had to post an update, as this place just rocks.  Burgers are really good, funky options like the peanut butter and jalapenos jelly and the apple and brie burgers are super tasty of course with a side of the duck fat fries to go with.  They have now added as testing room which makes it even more of an official brewery feel and good if you just want some brews.  Top quality beers, when they are good they are among the best out there. (some of their brews are just ok but cant win them all)"}
{"text":"We came here yesterday for lunch, it was our second time. I give the service 5 stars. Our waitress was very efficient, attentive and helped us with beer recommendations. I give the food 5 stars. The food is fresh, using local growers in interesting combinations, very good.  I got the beet, apple and goat cheese salad and I would highly recommend it.  Where they started loosing stars was when our meal was delivered. My husband paid extra to get the onion rings with his sandwich and when he asked for a side of ranch he was told that would be a dollar more. Mind you we're already paying an extra $2.49 to get the onion rings. We went ahead and agreed to pay for the ranch and the cup we got was the smallest possible, not more then a dimes worth.  The final nail in the coffin for me was just before leaving I went to the restroom and as I was washing my hands an employee came out of the stall and left the restroom without washing her hands. I was not too far behind her and as I left I looked over at the bar, she was behind the counter reaching for a beer glass to fill someone's beer order. It grossed me out thinking that she could have also fixed our beers.   I'm sad to say that I'm not sure I could go back. I hate to cross this one off my list but I can't overlook the lack of hygiene by their employees. I'm sure that happens all the time, but for an employee to do that when they see someone looking goes beyond my comprehension."}
{"text":"Best brewery I have ever been to hands down.  Everything about this place is on point.  We sat on the patio on a beautiful afternoon in AZ.  The place has a great feel to it.  Nice, open, all wood patio with lights and heat lamps and sunscreens.  Everything you would want out here.  The inside is big and clean.  Our waitress was extremely friendly and absolutely loved the beer menu.  This is what you want.  Someone who serves beer that loves the beer.  I've been to so many breweries and craft beer spots where the server/bartender is miserable and couldn't care less about their product.  This girl was so excited it was our first time and recommended half the beers on the menu with such enthusiasm.  It was almost like a friend brought us here and was telling us about their favorite beers.  We ordered a couple of flights and they were awesome.  Out of the 10 beers 8 of them were stellar.  The remaining two were very good as well.  It is damn near impossible to go to a brewery and have that many amazing beers on the menu.  Each one had it's own personality and uniqueness.  At some breweries every single beer tastes so similar its hard to tell them apart.  Not at Wilderness.  Each beer tasted like it was an award winner from a completely different brewery.  Absolutely blown away with how well they stood on their own.  Bravo!  A few of my favorites were: Bear Wallow Berliner Weisse, Sophmoric IPA, Picacho Pecan Pie Brown, and Peloncillo Porter.  All were lovely, however, I don't really feel you can order a bad beer here and that's the honest truth.  The price was also great.  5 4-oz pours for like 8 bucks.  We could have stayed all night long.  It was a Tuesday so we tried the tacos.  The pulled pork was very tasty.  Unfortunately, we already ate so we didn't try anything else off the menu but the plates going by and the smells in the air were delicious.    We grabbed a couple souvenirs and were on our way.  I can not wait to come back here.  Wish it was closer to my house.  Really can't recommend highly enough.  This is how all breweries should be.  Congrats & keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and beer! Try the pull pork fries with beer cheese. Never been to a brewery this was my first time. I will be back with friends and family."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this 4 stars and not five based on the fact that I've eaten at Mastros City Hall. That place is five stars all day long. That aside..  I don't give four stars lightly. This place is great!  I had the peanut butter and jalepeno jelly burger!!  So good!!!!!  I thought about buying an extra one and taking it home to stare at later.  It makes me wish I was fat so I could eat another one."}
{"text":"Just came here again for another stop after some Saturday shopping. Decided to grab some appetizers and a couple brews to get things started. We ordered the pork belly silders (AMAZING), pretzels with mustard and cheese, and last but not least some artichoke dip. For brews I started off with a 10oz New Brood (collab brew w/ Superstition Meadery), and the misses got a Peloncillo Porter (awesome fall/coffee flavors). My beer was amazing and just what I had been itching for after seeing them debut it on their Instagram. Second up I got a sour beer called Tart Sunshine. If you haven't had a sour beer I recommend starting with this as it is a nice crisp refreshing taste. I've found that Az Wilderness has not only some of the best brews around but the BEST SOUR BEERS around. The food was top notch as always and the service is flawless. I love coming here and as someone who is a native of Arizona I find it very legit that these guys are killing it so hard. Keep up everything you guys are doing. Look forward to the years ahead guys!"}
{"text":"Spectacular growth in just two years! It seems almost impossible.  The food is better than ever thanks to Chef Stacy, the service is good considering the crush of people coming in, be patient , have another beer, you are not at Dominos, everything is made fresh, the local meat provider option is cool, the brisket blended hamburgers are worth the wait. Do not miss a chance at the Pork Belly Sliders."}
{"text":"The brisket burger, chicken sandwich and pulled pork are all delicious! I'm a total french fry girl but I can't get enough of their house made chips! Their BBQ sauce is so yummy! The staff are all knowledgeable in \"beer talk\" and super friendly! The beer selection can be hit or miss, especially if you don't like IPA's. I'm not an IPA person (I love dark beer though) and there has been a few times where there hasn't been a beer I particularly enjoyed. If you do enjoy IPA's I think you are in the right place :)"}
{"text":"I thought the beer was good! I noticed this will be the 400th yelp review! Can I get a what what!? Ok how about a free beer next time? Looking forward to trying food next time."}
{"text":"What a great experience!  We've been to Wilderness several times, almost all sitting at the bar (which was great!). Today we took mom and our sister in for lunch and had a blast!  The food was great, the beer was awesome but the service was AMAZING!  Steve did an amazing job of providing recommendations on food (PB&J burger is a must) and beer (Santa Theresa oak aged).  Couldn't have asked for a better way to spend our time!  Thanks to Steve and the team today!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Bacon and Blue burger. It was very greasy and missing something. I added salt and it still needed something.  The chips were also unimpressive. No flavor.  The beer I ordered was harsh. I order a witbier and the did not balance the beets to make this an enjoyable beer. Will probably not go back."}
{"text":"Beer was amazing. Im not a fan of ipas so it was nice to have a few other options like the red i had and the kolsch. Service was quick and food was spot on. Had the fries with pork and damn tht was even too much food for two of us portions were that big. Def wanna come back and try more beers"}
{"text":"Freaking awesome food and Beer. Nuff Said!!!!"}
{"text":"I understand Friday nights are busy and I expect some wait time before being seated, but you gotta admit waiting over 1-1/2 hrs is ridiculous. Especially when you're told 45 mins top. No restaurant is worth this long of a wait."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this place. The outdoor setting is amazing and the place is really special and authentic. I tried the build your own burger and i chose the marinated chicken breast it is really high quality food. I gave it a 4 though because it does not have much food variety but i guess this is their point to have few special options that matches their beer selection."}
{"text":"Good Beer. Good food. Lots of choices. Has indoor and outdoor seating. Good Happy Hour specials."}
{"text":"We love this place & so do a lot of people! It seems to get bigger & more packed every time we go! For good reason though! Their sour beer BW is amazing! The burgers are really good & the staff is always friendly & attentive. The staff knows everything about every beer on tap!"}
{"text":"I decided to meet a friend for lunch, she had been wanting to try this place for awhile. We each ordered a pint, and then decided to do the sampler of all the beers on tap! Wow, we were amazed! And after calculating the volume, which was approximately 75 ounces, we were buzzed. We decided to keep the party going and buy a growler to take back to her place, so that there would be adult supervision when her kids came home from school. We proceeded to drink from the growler, jump on the trampoline, practice planking, and set up a hot tub before we turned in together for the night ;) Needless to say, we have been hanging out since... So I just wanted to thank this AMAZING brewery for their excellent beers and large flights which allowed us two adults lose our inhibitions and have some fun!"}
{"text":"There's a reason this was voted as one of the best brewery in the us. The food is always fantastic and the rotating beers will always have me wanting to come back."}
{"text":"Very tasty beer and a staff that loves the craft brew scene. Inside is a bit noisy and the patio a bit small. But if you are looking to hang out with like minded people on a sunny Saturday afternoon, the vibe here is excellent."}
{"text":"Great beer, wonderful patio, friendly service, and awesome food. What more can you ask for?! I love supporting  a local business. Definitely  recommend for anyone who has guests in town. Would give 5 star if hadn't  received poor  customer service in past  which  has been brought  to the attention of management. Overall  great place!"}
{"text":"Great place! Great beer! Great food! And they recently expanded. Interesting backstory on how they started. Always nice to see another micro-brewery open up in the valley and do well."}
{"text":"This brewery is pretty good. They have a tasting area, a bar area and an outside seating are for the restaurant part. I just tried their beer, but I thought it was pretty good. They have a lot of options and had even specialty beer during the holiday season.   Their staff was very nice and helpful when trying to choose which beer to get. I would recommend this place to other people."}
{"text":"Love that the fries are cooked in duck fat and then smothered in cheese and pulled pork, I mean c'mon, so good. Western burger was delicious too!   Beer was decent, wish they had a gluten free option for drinks."}
{"text":"Came here with the GF. The food is amazing. Make a reservation or come early. The food came out very quickly, almost too quickly. I had the Arizona burger medium and it was a little pink. Our server was very friendly and really knew the menu well."}
{"text":"Apple and brie burgers! I had no idea this was such a magical combination of flavors. OH and the fries! (they have some killer beers too)"}
{"text":"Easily the BEST brewery I've been to. The Refuge IPA and American Presidential Stout are my favorites. Plus the burgers, fries and chips are as good as I've had in AZ. 3 years and 35 lbs of being a craft beer junkie and I still haven't found anyplace like it. Cheers to the beards!"}
{"text":"First place I ever had a \"Common\" (AKA \"Sour\") beer and Belgische Frietjets (Rosemary and Thyme potatoes fried in duck fat)...yum! Now, some four years later they have expanded their footprint and their offering, still keeping their roots. Their burgers are awesome and the beer is even better."}
{"text":"The food was amazing - but the portions were a little large and overwhelming. Really chill environment and nice selection of microbrews. It reminded me of a lot of the smaller breweries up in the Portland area - just a very chill, anything goes type of setting. The beer (one their in house IPAs) was really good - I'd definitely like to see what else they have to offer. Prices were about average for a place of this nature.   Overall I was very pleased and would definitely go back again. Only next time I might split a burger :)"}
{"text":"Great brewery from the outdoor seating(which is dog-friendly) to the tap room! Beers are phenomenal and consistently rotating. The host staff are very welcoming and accurate in the wait times when there is one. Bartenders and servers are knowledgeable about all food and beer and recommendations are on point! Don't miss out on burger monday's, which are incredible every  week. Last, but not least, Matt is amazing. Thanks for the great service and delicious brews!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic craft beers. I love how no matter what beer you try, you can really taste the notes they put in. Tried sour beer for the first time ever and fell in love. They have a list on the wall of beers that are in the process and what is about to be tapped.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because I'm not a huge fan of the food. I've tried a few different things and haven't been super impressed. The burgers are ok, but their fries are cooks in duck fat and just seem too greasy to me.  The tasting room has been completed recently and is awesome if you're just coming for drinks. There's a great patio too!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Their sliders are amazing (my favorite are the meatloaf) and beers are really top notch. Great layout and overall a fun environment. Service was a little slow and some staff seemed a bit confused but I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Not a bad atmosphere. We were seated quickly. Our server needs to not be so tunnel visioned, I had to raise my had several times to get her attention. She had walked by one time and saw my empty beer glass and just kept on walking. Food; the artichoke dip was good, my burger only had half of the bottom bun! Wtf? When you pretty much only serve burgers and sandwiches don't f it up like that.  Beer; I had a refuge which I believe is there one beer they always have and it was not bad, a little fruity. Then I ordered a flight with others and did not drink even half of them. Horrible experience. I will never be back."}
{"text":"Fun place to visit. I went on a weeknight with a friend and we were seated immediately, no wait at all. The bartender told us about the specials and the beer they had on tap. We asked for a couple samples and they were great! We both had a burger and were very impressed with the speedy service and high quality of the food."}
{"text":"Wow. Amazing food. Great service. Christy and Andrea took care of us. The beer was great. The food was amazing. Service top notch. I really enjoyed the Merica fries. We added pork and had BBQ sauce with our fries. Wow. Then had a few beers refuge was awesome. We will be back."}
{"text":"Four stars for the beer and two for the food.  I've been pleased with all the beers I tried and will return just to have a drink. The food, however, just hasn't impressed me, even for bar food. My last burger was the consistency of watered down, undercooked meatloaf. I couldn't even pick it up. Everything else has been generally too greasy and soggy, which includes several of their burgers and sides. I suppose copious amounts of salt and grease encourage more drinking but it leaves me with the feeling of \"why did I eat that.\"  So I will not be ordering any more food."}
{"text":"Great craft beer!! We've been here a few times now & will continue to support this awesome establishment on a regular basis! We love craft beer & they have an extremely small set up, which is a big draw for us. They only serve their crafts (and tea, I think) so don't go lookin' for Bud, Coors or any other watery substance... This place is special & so is the love they put into their beer! It is not for the weak hearted, it's real beer with extraordinary tastes. Sometimes they have more choices than others & that's part of the fun... You never know what you're gonna get!  They have a decent menu with delicious burgers. Yay for the guys who were successful in seeing their vision become a tangible & superb reality for us!! Btw, there are many who feel this way, so it does get crowded & loud & you might have to wait if you don't go early. They also have a long bar type table that is neat, you sit intimately with strangers which can be fun & interesting if you want to chat up new friends or just eavesdrop, hee hee. Woohoo, this really is as good as it gets!! :)  Go there & partake in the joy of AZ Wilderness Brewing Co. \"Don't feed the beard\" Love it!"}
{"text":"I came here with my husband, who is a beer fanatic. I ordered the veggie burger and chips. We also got the pretzels and beer cheese, which was amazing! Best cheese I've ever had! And he really loved the beers! He tried all of them in the flight thingy. I don't really drink beer, but I take his word for it."}
{"text":"I love this bar, the atmosphere, the servers and the food.   Last time we were in we brought our friend from out of town and our server (McKinley) took such good care of us. I thought I wanted one beer, but he so very wisely, brought me a taster and one of another just in case. He had great suggestions on our dishes (add this, sub that, do you like that kind of taste?) and we absolutely loved our food and drink choices!   I am in love with the spinach dip and the salad was great. The boys finished their burgers and we had such a great night. I come here again and again and it's always packed. I know why!  People of all ages love it and so do we."}
{"text":"Their menu is great and everything I've had there has always been tasty. Though the service could have been better the last few times I've visited, I realize busy happy hour times can get crazy but we've always had a rather large group so I don't know how we get missed. Service was my only qualm on this review. However the food will always bring me back in less busy times."}
{"text":"Great food and beers, always busy, difficult to get seating. Always a must visit when we r in from OOT."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing beer. Very popular spot so be prepared to wait if going on a weekend or after 5pm on a week day. Definitely recommend the PB&J burger and When Pigs Fly Fries."}
{"text":"Great beer and amazing fries!!!! They have a huge push to use local products for all of their beers and food. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place was just okay - extremely loud, festive atmosphere with a limited (albeit eclectic) selection of beers. Ordered a burger with jalapeño and it absolutely melted my face off. After the first 2/3 of the burger, I had to remove the pepper because it was unenjoyable. The black bean burger did look sublime though (and not as face destroying haha)."}
{"text":"I love this place for the outdoorsy ambiance and diverse menu. The canoli nachos were a fun twist on desert, and the burgers were hearty and juicy. There is a separate tasting room, bar and patio seating with large tables roomy enough to seat 6 people comfortably.   Now for the beer selections: the Rincon Red was light and subtly flavorful; the Belgium Brown was exceptional in that it was smooth and very tasty. In fact, all 6 of us decided the Belgium was the way to go and agreed it was our favorite.   The place was really busy at  7pm on a Saturday, yet our wait time was only 15-20 minutes. We waited in the bar area for a table and it was fine. The wait gave us a chance to take in all the different aspects if this massive restaraunt. Definitely will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Lots of beer options and food is great. Outdoor seating and ok parking. They offer a beer flight and you can sample the beers too before buying a full glass."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out after work for happy hour with a few work buds... I really wasn't impressed.  First off, Parking was a bit scarce.. the place was packed.  Had to circle a few times to find a parking pace.  Got in and we were lucky to get a couple of spots at the bar as some other people were just leaving.  The first beers came fairly quickly - I tried the red Rock Secret for my first... I wasn't particularly impressed.    A bit too hoppy for me.. Granted I'm not big on hoppy beers in general so lets just say it wasn't for me.. Perhaps it was good for a hoppy beer.  The second beer I tried was The Bear Wallow Berliner Weisse (Grapefruit version).  The best way I could describe this was that it tasted like vomit.  I did choke it all down though as I was paying for it and I'm not big on complaining. Ugh.  The 3rd beer I tried was the Santa Teresa Enkel.. Which I didn't hate. It was OK.  I'd drink it again.. But I felt like I could get some other beer just like it at any other bar.    So I wasn't all that impressed with the beer.  Like I said earlier.. this place was packed.  It was LOUD inside.  I think there was music playing softly, but over the roar of the people crammed in there.. who could tell.  I'm also not a big fan of a super loud bar.  Couldn't really have much of a conversation with the people I was with without really yelling at each other.    The service was hit and miss.. Good at times.. Other times the bartender would ask if we wanted another round and we'd tell her what we wanted and then she'd serve about 50 other people before she came back and asked us again if we wanted anything.  It was busy.. So I get that.. They try hard.. It just seemed unnecessarily chaotic in there.    Can't say much about the food as I didn't have anything.. It smelled good though.  Bar food.. $10-12 for a burger.. Other interesting looking things on the menu.. Not really a huge selection though... Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.. I'd just hope the things they do have stand out.  I'd say if you're looking for a huge menu with options for kids, head over to Chili's or something.    One thing I observed while we spent a couple of hours there is how we mostly talked (yelled at each other) about great beers from other breweries, not the ones we were drinking.    Anyway.. I get how people may really like this place.. It just wasn't for me.  Wasn't impressed with the beer.  Not a big fan of loud crowded places anymore.."}
{"text":"Staff was awesome, I was traveling from Northern California and was excited to try the beers, sampled a few and took home a refuge and a hat! Coming from Sonoma county it was a pleasure to try some good beer. In Arizona! Will return next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Love coming here! Dog friendly patio & good, fresh food. Just wish they had more IPA options, last time I went they just had one. But I'll be going back next week hoping they have that Dirty Hop Water again! And the week after, and the next... hey, my dog asks me to take him, so what am I gonna do? Eventually get my Dirty Hop Water is what I'm going to do!"}
{"text":"I dined alone on a random Saturday morning, it was packed within 30 minutes of the doors opening - and for good reason, this place is amazing. What a cool nook in the middle of town, try a sour beer! The waffle onion rings with sriracha maple dip were amazing, and I couldn't finish the basket. Look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Delicious fries and yummy craft beer great place to try! Just keep in mind it may take a bit to be seated otherwise, will be going again."}
{"text":"Don't let the hype machine fool you.  Arizona Wilderness is a subpar brewery and restaurant masquerading as a hip joint.    Sure, there are a few trendy pints to sample.  But forget about options; all the place serves is their own goods.  Plus, if you actually find a beer you like, chances are it'll be off the menu by the time you return (they rotate the beer frequently). Most of the beers are so lofty that it's hard to know what you're sampling.  The beer menu is inundated with a litany of Webster words that confuse and distract from choosing the right beer.  Surprisingly, the food menu is the best part; especially the Black Bean Burger.  The \"create-your-own\" burger options are fun and some of the apps are well-priced.    My biggest gripe about the place is that it simply is trying too hard to mint itself as \"cool.\"  The clientele ranges from large-bearded hipsters to beer snobs.  It's definitely not an optimal place to watch a sporting event either.    So if you're looking for a trendy spot that you can brag about tasting the latest craft brew, then this could be your place.  But for my money, I prefer more consistency and authenticity."}
{"text":"Whenever we have a hankering for awesome food and the best beer around, we come to Wilderness.  It really is the best place we've found in the area.  Thanks to them, all other local beers are just mediocre at this point."}
{"text":"What a great place to check out, if you are traveling or living in the area this is a place that is doing good beer and good food. I went here as I was visiting my Dad who lives about 10 minutes from here. We decided to go on a Saturday for dinner. And it was packed, took about 15-20 minutes to get a table. But you can go into the tasting room and grab a beer and hit a spot under the misters to stay cool.   Beers are great here, they have a nice vairety of someting that any thirsty patron can get down with. I liked the Fresh & Squeez, nice fresh hopped IPA that had a west coast bite to it. Any way lets talk about this food. I got the Bacon Burger with the Peanut Butter and Jalapeno Jam. I made it local which means fresh local beef and went with the onion rings with Beglian waffle batter. Everything was fantastic. Burger was out of this world good and those onion rings made me wish I didnt have to drive 5 hours from SoCal to get them.   Seriously this place is great. My wife got the Beets & Goat Cheese burger and she loved it. When I go to visit my Dad this is going to be a must stop place for sure. Keep doing what you guys are doing AZ Wilderness Brew Co. CHEERS!!"}
{"text":"This Place changed my life!! no really!! I have never had \"bar food\" taste this great before!! This is bar fare at it's finest!!! The beer is outstanding and I believe that I am a better man now for having drank it!!! If you want a bud light and  crappy chicken wings then this is NOT the place for you!! expect the unexpected here!! the guy that sat next to us had been coming here for a while and mapped out the menu and beer for us. What a Great place!!! do yourself a favor and try EVERYTHING !! they also let you bring your dog to the outdoor seating!!!!"}
{"text":"When we went there it was really busy. We didn't eat we just drank. I love you atmosphere it was a really good time. The service was great. We were attended to. Overall experience was a four-star"}
{"text":"The tasting area outside is a great place to wait. The pretzels were amazing. Luna our server was amazing and everything was super fast. Not sure at all what others say about noise. ..seems normal for a busy brew pub and makes it easy to bring kids."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good about this place; in town for only 5 nights, the food, beers, and service at AWB were so good, we came back for two of the 5 nights we were in town. Our servers were universally happy, enthusiastic, gave great recommendations, and answered questions with great eagerness. Their beers are quite distinctive and tasty, ranging from sours to porters to IPAs, and the food--THE FOOD! I had a peanut butter and jalapeno-jelly hamburger that was out of this world, made even tastier by the fact that the PB & J are all made in-house. We loved this place and recommend it highly."}
{"text":"This place is great!  I love the atmosphere and the feel inside.  We stopped in on a Friday night which was relatively busy, but they were still able to seat us within about 20 minutes.  They also offer the tap room with open seating and food service.  The staff is friendly and very knowledgeable about their beers and local items on the menu.  We ordered a flight of beers which comes with 5 5oz pours for $10 - an AMAZING deal if you ask me.  Their burgers (which we were told have won awards) are also very tasty.  Looking forward to going back and bringing out of town guests to this awesome spot!"}
{"text":"This is truly one of the best breweries in the country. Each time we're in town my partner and I stop by for a pint. Their sours are routinely on par with any sour, anywhere. We were most recently visiting Phoenix earlier this month on Labor Day weekend and despite the busyness received excellent and efficient service.   I wanted to take home their newly introduced Russian Imperial Stout but they had already sold out. However, when my partner emailed them last week to inquire about acquiring some, they sent us a free care package!   Thanks Truly tremendous company; incredible product and good people who provide it."}
{"text":"Returned 3 days ago - almost still the same. This time we were there with colleagues from Europe who have extensive beer tasting experience (unlike me). They were not impressed with the beer offerings but understood the limited experience of the brewery and it's staff. The duck fat fries were still cold and tasteless. The technique is simple: Blanche and put aside. Deep fry only when orders come in. Serve hot. Add a little salt. Serve hot. Did we say: serve HOT?  Service was better than our first visit since this was on a Tuesday evening so there were fewer people. Very attentive and efficient server. Offered free samples which was one of my previous complaint.   Around 7:30 PM the noise level started to rise. At that point, we had to scream at each other, which in turn, caused others around us to raise their voices even more. The place just became intolerably noisy and we left.  We'll give them another month or two."}
{"text":"All I can say is that everyone should go here and order their Peanut Butter and Jalapeño Jelly burger! It is absolutely delicious!! But that's not the only thing on the menu that is amazing. They have several delicious appetizers and entrees. Their staff is incredibly friendly and fun. I haven't had one server there that I did not love. I genuinely have a good time every time I am there because of the service. You are greeted and served quickly with little wait time at all. When there is wait time though, I recommended trying one of their delicious craft beers. They have such a unique take on food and beverages. I definitely suggest going here."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place in Gilbert to get great beer and good food.  Wilderness crushes the beer game. Always keeping things fresh, new and interesting."}
{"text":"Great craft beer selection and their peanut butter jelly burger is a must try!! Also enjoyed their pretzel sticks with beer cheese!! Service has always been friendly and accommodating! 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Had the IPA which was classic, crisp and satisfied. The fries with rosemary and thyme were the perfect compliment. Our waiter remembered our names and was efficient, friendly and highly knowledgable about the beers they offered. I am going back and taking all of my friends who appreciate a delicious, local beer, great customer service and high-quality food."}
{"text":"I have always loved the beer and now I have tried the food. They have mastered the art of both. The green chile pork and suck fries are fantastic."}
{"text":"It was quite a bit of a drive for me, but it was worth it because this place is where I had one of my best happy hours ever. The atmosphere was lively and very casual, and our server was cool, efficient and very helpful in guiding us through our selections for our drinks. To go with the drinks, I ordered their tasty chicken wings confit. I also had their Belgische frietjes - fries cooked in duck fat and served with garlic aioli; it was over-the-top awesome. This is a great place to share food and drinks with friends and is now one of the places I mention when people ask for suggestions for a great happy hour hangout."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and the beer is awesome.  The flights are served with decent sized pours, which is enough for my husband and I to share.  They definitely need to expand as it is always super busy."}
{"text":"This is a cool place to grab some good beer. There are very friendly people here and lots of very knowledgeable patrons who are into the craft beer scene. I was able to sample 10 beers, and they were all pretty good. Definitively the ambiance adds to the experience, so don't be shy and hit the bar and those sitting next to you."}
{"text":"Very good custom crafted brews from bearded people who really seem to care. The food is good also, not too mind bedding, but tasty no-the-less.  This place always keeps it interesting by constantly cycling through there recopies.  Voted bust brew pub in the world by some magazine at some time...how ever much weight you want to apply to that recognition.   I say good stuff, check it out!"}
{"text":"Delicious beer & food! The burger with peanut butter & jalapeño  jelly is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place 1000 times due to our office being half a mile away. We finally decided to check it out and see if they had any solid food. My expectations were surpassed! I got the Az trail burger. I definitely recommend. Joe did a great job waiting our table. We'll be coming back more often!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome :)  apparently I am not a fancy beer kind of girl ;) I did however LOVE the food :)"}
{"text":"After a quick jaunt out to Wave Cave in the Superstitions, some friends and I felt that was a little too tame and headed out to a TRUE wilderness excursion -- AZ Wilderness Brewing excursion, that is!  It's a pretty neat brewery with plenty of outdoor seating (and heating -- it was a bit nippy for sure) on either side of an indoor (but very open-feeling) area with a bar. They've got a pretty appropriate cabin-decor vibe going on.  We were promptly helped by one of the cute waitresses -- I got their pecan pie brown ale and was about to go with the poutine fries but really wanted to drive some meat into me so opted for the pulled pork fries instead. Gotta say, can't go wrong with the fries. A friend got one of the burgers, and that thing looked juuuuuicy.  Basically, if you're in the mood for some good beer and burger/fries and ALSO want to feel like you got to enjoy the great Arizona outdoors, throw on a flannel and some wool socks and get over to AZ Wilderness Brewing!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and to the point. The IPA they had was delicious. The trail burger and flying pig fries were way above average for any restaurant, not just better than regular bar food. The place was PACKED, so we sat outside so we could talk to each other instead of screaming. Very loud inside, but hey, thats a bar for ya.  I'd go back for the food and beer, maybe during non-peak hours for a more relaxed experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick bite to eat after arriving from PHX.  It was a week night and I was hungry.  Just my luck it was taco Tuesday.  Didn't care much for the pork taco, in fact it didn't really taste that good so I didn't finish it, but the taco they had on special was amazing.    Atmosphere was cool.  I sat at the bar.  My bartender Tiffany did an excellent job providing service and recommending food and drink on the menu.  The other staff seemed friendly and happy to work there.    My only complaint is that the men's bathroom was pretty nasty compared to the rest of the establishment.  It needs to be updated.  Other than that I will definitely come back to try the different beers and food."}
{"text":"Enjoyable and casual atmosphere. Eclectic variety of beers available. Nice variety of burgers & chicken can be substantiated for any of the burgers. Our party Tried southwestern chicken and burgers. No one was disappointed but the burger was ordered to be medium & was well done."}
{"text":"First time visit. I really enjoyed the Delicious foods and beers. Also all staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"FARMHOUSE ALE - SAISON LOVER??  In town and stumbled on this place because they claimed to have a few different Saison ales on tap.  I tried 'em all!  A big WOW to the \"Hero in a Half Shell\" - Saison / Farmhouse Ale.  I could drink  this every day for the rest of my life!  Smooth, a little sweet, citrus-sy and A-OK by me.  Wish I could take it home on the plane, or better yet have it available locally... The other styles they had available in this genre were indeed interesting, everything from squash, cinnamon and beets.  Try them all if you dig a farmhouse ale! Oh yea, the food looked pretty good too, but I wasn't there to eat.  The GF said the chicken drummie offering was excellent, we noticed the duck fat fries, but didn't try them."}
{"text":"Great beer, great food, great service. And I felt like I was in a national park!"}
{"text":"I'm probably going to break a few hearts here but I'm long overdue on this review. I've been to AZ Wilderness a few times now to check out the \"Nation's Best Brewery\" just down the street from me. And you can tell they work hard for this honor. And with the service I've gotten there each time, the constant rotating brews, and the awesome cabin style atmosphere, I can definitely say they have earned it.  The food is the typical brewery fare with a few twists. The burgers and tacos I've had have been okay but nothing mind blowing. The duck fat fries are a pleasant twist to traditional fries that are very enjoyable and the waffle battered onion rings are awesome. But, being a brewery, the food isn't usually my main focus.  My reasoning behind my rating is more because of my own personal taste in brews. We all have our preferences and I'm no different. My biggest turn off with beer is when they have a rough Hops aftertaste. This is the main reason that I just can't drink most IPAs, no matter how many I try. I'm definitely more of an Amber or Wheat beer drinker myself.  Most of the beers I've had at AZW sadly have enough of this aftertaste to them that I have a hard time enjoying them. I can't stomach their flagship IPA Refuge and every time we've gone, the beer rotation has been heavy on Pale Ales, IPAs,  Saisons, and other hoppy beers. I have tried a few of their seasonal dark beers and they aren't bad at all! I have sampled their Presidential Stout (fuzzy on the name but know had jalapeno hints in it) which had a unique and pleasant flavor as well as their Pecan Pie Porter which was interesting but didn't really do much for me.  I love how AZW isn't afraid to try new things with their beers. Be it dropping a Pecan Pie or a Chocolate Bunny into the cask, you can expect something truly unique. My hopes are sometime soon I can enjoy a beer style more to my tastes. In the meantime though, I will happily play DD just to enjoy the atmosphere and meet up with some of my favorite peeps."}
{"text":"Excellent beers and great selection. Lots of locally brewed really outstanding.  Food was also surprisingly good.  Service friendly and efficient. Very good value. Impressed."}
{"text":"Definitely would return here. The beer and atmsophere are excellent. The staff are MORE than friendly. Sad that I live in Maine"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here on a Friday night about 6pm for the first time. We had an hour wait which was fine since they were busy but when it was our turn to be seated they asked if it was okay to be seated at a table with another couple. At first we said yes because we were very hungry at that point but they didn't tell us it was a high top table which we were unable to do. They did apologize for not telling us ahead of time and they sat us at a regular table. Our waitress was kind but she was extremely busy and only checked on us once close to the end of our meal before we got our check. We ordered the artichoke dip with warm tortilla chips but our chips were cold and the dip was barely warm. My husband and I both ordered a sandwich but there wasn't anything special about it. My sandwich was lacking flavor and salt."}
{"text":"Possibly the best tasting burger I've had in all of AZ. Beer selection and staff knowledge is impressive and the food tastes amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously awesome. Local brewery with paleo options. The beer is good, cocktails are delicious, great service, nice atmosphere. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Was over in Tempe to see our niece at ASU and wanted to grab lunch so decided we have heard how good this place is so decided to try it for our self.  Service and food were really good...would come back if I were over by the location. Wish they had a place on the west side."}
{"text":"The staff was wonderful and friendly.  I had the mushroom burger with some loaded French fries. Burger was okay, the friend were gross and cold. Maybe it was the sauces they used. Not sure, but the experience was great. Definitly will recommend for drinks, but not so much for the food, or at least burgers and fries."}
{"text":"This is a freaking cool place.  When you walk in, the smells of hops and malt hit you and make your mouth absolutely water.   It's a very comfortable atmosphere.  I walked right up to the bar, found a place, and ordered a flight.  Their presentation is definitely one of the most unique I've seen.  There is such an attention to detail with these beers.  You can tell they are fresh and using local ingredients is a big thing for me.  Favorites in the flight were their flagship Refuge IPA and Granola Stout.  Wish they hadn't run out of the stout or I'd have ordered a pint.  Their food is also spot on.  I settled on the AZ Trail burger, which was cooked perfectly.  The BBQ sauce had a nice kick to it.  The fries may kill me, but I'll die happy.  Seriously, they cook them in duck fat.  Such a deep unctuous flavor in there.  Sorry, mouth watering again.  If I had to ding them for anything, it was the bartender didn't seem to really want to be there.  In such a cool environment, but maybe familiarity breeds contempt if you're around it all the time?  I don't know, but other than that, this would probably be my weekly spot if I lived out here."}
{"text":"Pros: Beer Cheese - Great / IPA - Great  Cons: Everything else. This place could really use to clean up a bit - very dirty, poor set up for people to have room, furniture and chairs wobbly and sub quality. Service was also sub par - in fact they overcharged me on my debit purchase where the tip was concerned....there was no tip and they added one...so very shady and I will not go back based on that.   San Tan Brewery has a much nicer atmosphere, much cleaner, and the service is night and day compared to this place. Think of a dive bar with one good beer - of thats what you want -- You'll get it @ AZ Wilderness Brewing."}
{"text":"Best AZ local brewery in town. These guys are so incredibly creative with their brews & their commitment to use local ingredients makes them an Arizona must. Best saison I have ever had. Their food is delicious & equally creative (duck fat fries - yes please). We love our AZ Wilderness brewery & tasting room."}
{"text":"This place has become a regular stop for me for since they opened up in 2013. I seriously love this place! I have always felt AZ Wilderness was one of the first places to make craft brews a big deal in the East Valley. Their story is simple - a couple of guys who love beer sharing their craft with the rest of us who love beer. They got started from a Kickstarter campaign and have been killing it since then. A lot of their popularity came from word of mouth and from building relationships around the Valley. Not only do they have great beer, but they have delicious food as well. AZ Wilderness has a pretty large selection of original beers that they rotate in and out off their menu. Most of them are seasonal and they produce around 3,000 barrels a year. If you have never been, I recommend getting a beer flight and sampling many of their flavors. I love that they try to bring a little of Arizona to some of their seasonal favorites. Many of the beers that they feature center around local ingredients. An example is they use fresh pine from the Mogollon Rim area for their Pine Mountain Sour Pale Ale. The Picacho Pecan Pie Brown Ale is one of my personal Fall favorites and a must try. Arizona Wilderness has won many awards and has really made a name for themselves in a short amount of time. They expanded their space not too long ago to include a tasting room and an area to purchase 32 oz cans. Some of my favorite food items are the jalapeno meatloaf and green chili pork belly sliders, the hand-cut duck fat fries and the peanut butter jalapeno jelly burger. You can tell they aren't afraid to push the limits here with their food. The décor gives a nice outdoorsy feel to it and there is always a good crowd on hand. My one knock is parking can be a little tight on busy nights."}
{"text":"Amazing local brewery, because of the popularity  parking can be an issue. Overall great atmosphere, food and beer."}
{"text":"I left this place feeling *underwhelmed*. Although the service and atmosphere were great I did not like my chicken sandwich (patty was huge and lacked any real flavor),  the coffee stout was just ok and the nacho cannoli was disgusting. Why only one dessert option? Throw in a brownie or something! I will give props to this place though for letting us sit  at 10:50 on a Saturday morning when the place opens at 11. We had our newborn baby with us so when we go out for lunch it has to be on the early side."}
{"text":"Great place. First time here. We're big time craft beer drinkers and have tried a lot across the country. Have to say the beer here is very good, as is the food. We had a friendly and fun server (Chance) that took great care of us. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Top notch seems like such a silly way to describe something, but this place leaves me almost speechless so I have to.  Both the pecan pie brown and the grapefruit gose were refreshing and bursting with flavor.  The pretzel bites are so good and the beer cheese tastes almost bacon infused.  The best shareable though, was the Belgian waffle battered onion rings.  They were the absolute perfect balance of sweet and salty, and the siracha maple dipping sauce added an extra level of flavor similar to chicken and waffles. Everyone with me enjoyed every single thing they ordered including the Arizona trail burger, the PB&J burger, and the western grilled cheese.  Everything was so good that that the question was asked, \"can we come back for dinner?\"  Service from Cori was absolutely on point and I know we just found a new regular hangout."}
{"text":"We discovered this place 3 years ago and we love everything about this place!  The staff is informative and helpful. The beers are excellent.  The food is very good including dessert. The addition of the back patio enlarged the seating area.  We can't wait to introduce more people to it!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and WOW. Amazing service and amazing food..not to mention everything is locally sourced and they are eco-friendly. Our server, Jeff, had great recommendations for food and beer. He provided quick service and was very attentive to our needs. Not to mention, They have recycled material to-go boxes and 100% recycled napkins...which is always a plus in my book. Great job Arizona Wilderness..keep  it up!!"}
{"text":"I tried Desert Eagle as it is closer, but when I get two growlers filled at a time I prefer the beer to be top notch. The IPA and the Enkel are extremely drinkable, from the atmosphere and my drinking experience I would say the rest of the beers hold their own among the best in their respective class or flavor profile. It was early afternoon on Sunday and the whole place was busy, lots of satisfied looking people."}
{"text":"Great restaurant hang out.  The beer on tap selection is unbeatable.  The selection is more about quality than quantity yet there is something for everyone.  Everything on the menu is enticing but the prices are pretty high.  Grass fed and organic.    We loved our food although I usually don't prefer my burger that rare.  All burgers are supposed to be prepared medium rare but ours were not even reasonably close to anyone's standards of medium rare.    My order came out wrong and the person delivering the food (not the waiter) tried to convince me that it was the correct item.  He was kindof a jerk about it.  When my waiter took a closer look they agreed it was something else, not what I ordered.  Rather than wait for a redo I accepted it and made sure that we got billed for the item I received rather than the more expensive item I ordered.    I love the quality and care put into the entire menu.  I love the dinning room and bar (live music outside is a huge plus).  Our waiter was knowledgeable about both the beer menu and food menu, he made excellent recommendations from both.  The customer service is still lacking and the kitchen made quite a few mistakes with our table's order even though we had a small group of three.  Everything should have been pretty straightforward, we didn't have any special requests or anything like that.  I might also mention that it was a Tuesday night and they weren't particularly busy.  This place is capable of five stars, there's a lot to like about it.  However, if a place is going to be \"high end\" (as the quality and prices would suggest) the staff better start to deliver.    I'm not sure if we will be going back.  At these prices a second chance isn't likely and there are plenty of good breweries around.  They aren't likely to miss my business as this place seems pretty popular but \"me and mine\" will likely go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This review is coming from a non-beer drinker, just to give you a perspective. I do wish they had a full bar or at least wine or even cider, but I get it, it's a brewery.  The burger I had here probably ranks as one of my top three burgers ever. Their Mushroom and Beer Cheese Burger is a thing of beauty. Always cooked perfectly, the brisket patty is topped with sautéed mushrooms and the best beer cheese you've ever tasted. As if that weren't enough, they serve it on a pretzel bun! And I have to admit I'm a sucker for any restaurant that makes their own potato chips.   I love the decor in this place too - I would describe it as \"backwoods industrial\". I think they require their servers to have a minimum of three tattoos and it's rare to find a male server without facial hair. Service has always been great, in my experience.   The only thing I hate is that sometimes we have to wait for a table. They do get quite crowded for dinner especially on weekends, but last time I was there it looked like they might be expanding the dining room a bit, not sure. They have outdoor seating so when the weather is not unbearably hot, you can enjoy your burger and beer under the bistro lights.   Great place to take out of town guests!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place rocked. The large patio, the tap room, the beers, the food, the friendly servers...  It was extremely busy- but I can see why. I had amazing giant lollipop wings, had some delicious nachos and my boyfriend had a burger with an over easy egg and it was all amazing. Succulent, tasty, fresh an colorful are just some words I would describe the food. It's hard not to fill up on food here- BUT DON'T! Make sure you leave room, or just drink before you eat because you won;t want to miss out on their great brews.  For your craft beer/ delicious food fix- this is your place!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love fries fried in duck fat?! Or burgers on pretzel rolls?!? The food is delicious. The beer is interesting."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE BREWERY.  I love coming here, and especially when I have out of town guests to brag about our brewery scene.  The beers are unique and creative and DELICIOUS, the food is amazing, and the entire vibe is great.  Love the AZ scenic slideshow!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Arizona. The beer is always delicious as well with the food. Ive never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Wow! This may be my new favorite brewery, or at least the one I will now compare all other to. Let's start with the beer because well you are looking at a review of a brewery after all. It was great! The Dirty Hop Water may be my favorite beer ever (I even went back the next day to try and get more but sadly it was gone already). Now on to the food...you must try the duck fat French fries (even better with the pulled pork and beer cheese on them) and the meatloaf sliders were also amazing and I can't believe I almost forgot about the amazing chicken tacos. I absolutely cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"i sat at the bar \"tasting room\" which seemed pretty cool. i ordered a beer after being waited on after 5 min which is normal. beer was served promply with a menu. Then 20 minutes went by and i realized i was invisible.i eventually just walked out! Sad day!"}
{"text":"Wow. We just returned from dinner and had literally one of the best burgers (and beer!) we've had in years. Each burger was perfectly cooked, topped with creative ingredients that played off one another perfectly. I couldn't stop eating the duck fat fries and the Belgian waffle deep fried onion rings dipped in seracha- so, damn, good. The sweet potato saison was a balanced and beyond delicious. You guys nailed it. I may now be your #1 fan."}
{"text":"I came in here last night for the first time for a couple beers and apps and was impressed with the concept.  Atmosphere:   They have three different seating areas depending on your mood. They have a \"tasting room\" ideal if you want to try the different types of beers they have shown on tap with a few of their actual brewing tanks/brewing room.   They have a patio with picnic style tables if you're up for dining/drinking in the fresh air  Then they have of course, indoor seating where they will play live/loud music and a divey bar atmosphere.   Drink:  We picked the tasting room, where I tried the Refuge IPA, The Dakofa Ale, and their lightest beer which slightly tasted of the dakofa but eliminating the belgian bite after your sip. It's the perfect brew and I would definitely recommend it to all beer enthusiasts/drinkers.  Food: We tried the spinach artichoke dip with homemade corn chips which was pretty tasty for bar food, along with the pretzel sticks and beer cheese. I really liked the beer cheese, but the pretzels could have been better. It was slightly on the bland/dry side, but overall it was okay.   Their menu items are really unique, if you come across it online, you'll know what I am talking about.   I live in Scottsdale, but made about a 30 min drive to get to here, which didn't feel very far. I hear that they're opening up a smaller location in downtown gilbert, but I hope someday they will expand to scottsdale/phoenix!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and loved it even more the second time around. Be prepared to wait for a table, but know that it's worth it. You can get beer at the bar while you wait.  All the beers are excellent. Was lucky enough to try the Big Horn Triple IPA last week, which was incredible. They have some great, funky beers that are delicious - a cereal saison (Hero in a Half Shell) and a saison made with butternut squash and cinnamon (Recolte - current favorite). Excellent mainstays too like the Refuge IPA.  To eat, it's hard to get anything other than the burger with peanut butter and jalapeno jelly. It's the most fabulous burger ever. Duck fat fries are great and the artichoke dip appetizer is stellar."}
{"text":"This is simply a review of the beer. The staff was great and we didn't eat anything.   First off, a flight of 5 beers for $8 is one heck of a price. However, I could only drink 2 of them since the others were terrible (disclaimer: I hate sour beers and dislike IPAs so take this review with a grain of hops)   I am glad there is a brewery in Gilbert and I am sure they will continue to do well, I just didn't like any of the beers I had. They change up every two weeks so hopefully the next time I'm here they will have something to my taste (witbier, ambers, lagers, porters, brown ales)"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Beer was stellar!!!! So many varieties and creative too! A lot of thought about into their beer. If you are a craft beer lover please come here!!   Service and food was just as good! Our server was super friendly And didn't make us feel bad for bringing our kids with us.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable service. We were immediately greeted and sat at a table. Our waitress was prompt and knew the beers available. We come to breweries for the beer. Our waitress, Julie, had a lot of knowledge about the beers. She helped us choose a flight of beers to try. Being from Oregon, we've had some good craft beer. We fell for the Tres Alamos Tripel and I'm a Stout lover.   The food matched the the great beers. I had the Good morning burger. Absolutely delicious. My wife had the chicken wings. Boy they pack a punch. Good but spicy.   This was our first time here and we were definitely happy."}
{"text":"Duck fat fries!!!! Yes, you read that correctly and they are as delicious as they sound. I remember this place when it was just the back building. The food and beer were fantastic then too. The only reason for the missing star is that oftentimes they don't have a beer that is the \"middle of the road\" and not quite so adventurous. While I love craft beer, oftentimes i have company with me who may not be as brave and they struggle to find something to drink. As always, the food is top notch."}
{"text":"Love the build your own burger and wings!!! Go there and do not be disappointed!! Get there early- piles of people come quickly! Kid friendly, too!"}
{"text":"Awesome beer and great food! Mot much else to say. beer lovers need to make it a stop along the way. Rode my harley out and had an IPA and a burger. Most tasty!"}
{"text":"Ahhhhmaaazing. Every time my husband and I go here we are so satisfied! I always think I'm going to try something new, but the blue cheese, bacon, carmelized onion burger is just too good. We try different beers each visit and yesterday I took home a growler of the Pistachio Shake.   Pistachio shake: delicious! Not as sweet as I anticipated (which was a pleasant surprise), well balanced, smooth. Go get some!  Staff is always attentive. Everyone has a good, positive vibe. Yesterday, we had the pleasure of Kaylyn serving us. She's fantastic! From start to finish: hostess, the gent who sat us, food runner, and another gal behind the bar who shared the high tops...such a great experience.   Looking forward to our next burger and beer (or three)"}
{"text":"This is really as good as it gets. But seriously AZ Wilderness has the best craft beer in the city hands down and some of the best food in the East Valley. This place gets slammed so be prepared for a wait especially on weekends but its definitely well worth it. What I really enjoy about this place is they have multiple rotating crafts so every time you go your bound to see something you never had before. For the menu burgers here are excellent and beef is all locally grown if your into that kinda thing. House chips are great but I really enjoyed the duck fat fries!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a beautiful Saturday - crazy busy but totally worth the wait! The poutine fries were out of this world. We almost ordered seconds! The beer bacon n bleu burger was good.  The best part-our flight of beer! Can not express how amazing the pastry light was. Like an almond joy in beer form! Wow! Excellent service and atmosphere. VERY dog friendly! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We visited Arizona Wilderness for the first time to meet a friend, and I could not have been happier with the whole experience.  The wait staff was friendly and took excellent care of us.   We were there for a weekend lunch, so it was not crowded when we arrived, but even once most of the seats were filled the noise level was still quite nice, no need to shout to talk around the table.  The beer was excellent, since I did not write this review immediately after, I have forgotten what I had, but everyone at our table enjoyed their beers.  I had the Ruben Burger, and that has instantly made my top 5 list, and I freaking love hamburgers.  Now that I'm writing this, I think I should go suggest we visit them for lunch again soon!"}
{"text":"Food is great!  Service is awesome!!  Beer is out of this world!!  I just wish the owners would talk to all the guests, not just their friends.  The owners should take customer service classes from their servers."}
{"text":"Excellent hand crafted burgers.   Pretzel sticks were fantastic along with the beer mustard.   Homemade ketchup is a nice touch instead of the regular corn syrup type.  Arizona burger on pretzel bun with handcut bacon was awesome.    The Belgian wheat beer was very good.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Obviously a lot of people like this place, but they don't serve the type of burger we like.   Pretzels - hard outside and soft on the inside. They didn't have much flavor. The beer cheese dip (NOTE TO BE VEGETARIANS/NON PORK EATERS) has a strong smokey bacon flavor we didn't prefer, while I love the idea of fresh ground beer mustard, it was 'meh'. You can definitely taste the beer. Overall, just wasn't the flavors we like.   We ordered our burgers medium well vs standard med rare. Although the burgers are hand crafted, they were not very flavorful. The flavor really comes from the toppings and sauces. The pretzel bun didn't taste like pretzel to me and I ended up tearing most of the bread off. The brioche bun was good.   The housemate chips were bland and tasteless. We had one and done.   The onion rings- the first bite was just weird because of the waffle batter but it did grow on my husband (not me). It's still not his preferred beer battered rings but it was good with the sriracha sauce.  The environment is very loud. Service was friendly. Would I come back? Probably not."}
{"text":"Peanut butter and jalapeno jelly burger is fantastic. Add in some of those duck fat fries, yum. They always have a good selection of beer too.. just gotta try to get there early because the place is always packed."}
{"text":"Duck fat french fries and pretzel buns with beer cheese dip does anything else need to be said"}
{"text":"I don't know how else to put it but absolutely amazing! the service and staff is the best and the beer and food are top notch. Try the refuge ipa and the duck fat fries."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best brewery/restaurants I've been to in the valley! All food was on point: fresh Ingredients cooked to perfection, lots of menu options, great combinations! I had the \"after the hike\" burger and duck fat fries - amazing! The chocolate bunny stout was delicious and they even have cool T-shirt's and caps! Great dinner spot in Gilbert"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great beer and the people are awesome! Very diverse menu for both food and beer. Definitely the new hangout spot"}
{"text":"Decided to treat my family to dinner so we came on a Thursday night at around 7:00pm and the place was packed. The hostess said our wait time would be around an hour to an hour and half, and we ended up waiting for just under an hour.   Our server brought us water almost immediately after we were seated (it's the little things!). I ordered the Arizona Trail burger with a side of chips and devoured my meal like a ravenous savage. AZ Wilderness is killing the burger game, especially because of the sublime quality of beef that they use. +1 for having a really good brioche bun too!  As for the beer, I tried the Blood Orange Gose and thought the Sour/Salty element paired nicely with a hearty burger. It's more sour than salty, which I prefer but then again I am no beer connoisseur. Still highly recommend though. Was tempted to sample more offerings from the brewery but remembered that I am of Asian descent and therefore a lightweight by design. Oh well, at least this gives me a good excuse to visit AZ Wilderness more often."}
{"text":"I went here once with a friend just to try them out. OH MY GOD! They served a sirachi sauce with my Onion Rings. I used it on my hamburger and now I'm addicted. I've been there 4 more times since within a month.  Service is a little slow so you need a little more time for lunch but the food taste fantastic.  I hear there beer is really good too. I don't really drink so I don't know.  They custom make their sauces and ketchup."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is good, comfortable, sorta, but I am not getting why the reviews are so high.   They do not have a bar or serve wine, only beer.  There are a dozen other breweries to go to that will have a bar.  Service was ok, quick but not friendly.  I ordered a burger med-well and she said they only do med-rare or well-done so I said well-done. Apparently there are only two settings on the stove. No duck fat fries for me!  My husband had a beer, he said it was \"ok\".  I do not drink beer.  Our food arrived and my burger was med-rare.  I could not eat the middle uncooked part,  guess they only have one setting on the stove.  My husband had the chicken club, he said it was \"ok\"  The patio sits on the SW side of the building so the sun was really beating down on us.  And there is a gate to the patio people of course were going in and out of.  OMG!!!!! Someone get this place some W40 or something, the high pitch screech the gate made was the same sound as nails on a chalk board.  Let's just finish our food and go.  There are a lot of other choices.  Like I said, my husband likes beer, he likes Four peaks, San Tan and Uncle Bear.  Just a idea of his beer taste."}
{"text":"Decent choices in beer, the server was super helpful.  Food was really good.  One draw back,  I'm not a meat eater,  few more vegetarian choices wouldn't hurt.  The black bean burger was good,  but really dry,  needs a sauce.  Artichoke dip tho, freaking amazing. I would go back,  atmosphere is pretty cool too."}
{"text":"OMG - I don't even like beer that much, but I LOVE this beer.  And the food is to live for!  SIX stars, at least.  Don't wait, GO!  And they're planning an expansion."}
{"text":"I love any time I come here but today was even better because the music was bad ass! Pantera, Ozzy, Van Halen, Danzig and more played in the background while I enjoyed Grapefruit Refuge and an After the Hike burger. Great place to chill and have beers with your pups too. Our pups are always welcome and happy with all the attention and love."}
{"text":"Arizona Wilderness used to be my and my husband's favorite place to take family and friends. We started going when the restaurant was only a couple months old and it's been fun to watch them grow into the building and renovate and experience how their beer offerings have changed over the years. My husband even had his bachelor party there when he and I got married. The food and beer at AZ Wilderness are good and the atmosphere is decent, but the reason why I've got to knock my rating down is because their service so poorly accommodates veganism.  Not only does being vegan at AZ Wilderness mean you have to explicitly ask questions of the hurried staff who aren't always diligent about responding as accurately as possible, request a protein/high calorie substitution which you may be charged extra for, but as for my own part, I believe I was knowingly served a duck fat-fried black bean patty by my server who knew that I was trying to opt out of animal products. I believe this because my patty was clearly breaded and deep-fried in something (and it was very crispy), but afterward I had the same familiar indigestion, gas, and heartburn that I've experienced before after eating animal products for the first time in a long time as an on-off vegetarian and have never experienced since going vegan, even after eating food that's been fried in oil.  For specific details, I called ahead of time to ask about vegan options, and when I asked if the black bean burger was free of all animal products, the person who answered the phone was very unsure but said that it was. Given the uncertainty she seemed to have, I asked if the buns that came with the patty were made with milk or eggs and she said she didn't know. If I hadn't asked, I would have just assumed she knew. She went on to suggest that I order a salad instead to make sure, but when I said I would be coming hungry and would prefer the burger if it was vegan, she suggested that I replace the buns with lettuce or leave them out entirely. I guess she doesn't know just how much more calories two big hamburger buns have than romaine lettuce, which is an honest mistake for an omnivore, but nevertheless I could see that I was getting nowhere with her so I thanked her, hung up, and decided to eat a lot before I went and just order a small salad when I got there.  When I arrived, it was my server who said he wasn't sure if he could substitute avocado for the cheese (there's no vegan salad), but told me that instead I could upgrade to putting a patty over the salad. I asked if the patty, just all by itself, was vegan, he went and asked the chef, told me that the chef told him it was, and then when our food arrived handed me a plate with a black bean patty that had been breaded and deep-fried. Given our previous conversation, I just assumed when I saw it that he would have made sure that it wasn't fried in duck fat, but my bowels told me the whole story later. I can't imagine a scenario where the chef breaded and fried a food, that's ordinarily meant for vegetarians, in duck fat (or anything for that matter), unless the server asked him to.   I was pretty upset about it and considered going back and asking management to waive our bill (we wouldn't have gone there if we'd known the server was going to do that), but I knew it would be a complete waste of time. Of course they'd just deny everything, if they even gave me enough time to even speak to someone who remotely cared at all. You really don't understand how much animal products screw up your digestion until you go without them for a long time and eat them again for the first time yourself so they probably wouldn't even have believed that I could know as well as I know that it really was duck fat fried.  I've knocked my rating down as low as I have because a place that celebrates the Arizona Wilderness really should put their money where their mouth is and offer an entree that's free of animal products, since it's animal products that destroy the wilderness more than anything else. We won't be back until the menu has some more obviously vegan options so I don't have to talk to anyone about substitutions, ask anyone questions, or rely on anyone else's sense of humor toward vegans."}
{"text":"I have a few reasons for the less-than-stellar rating this place usually gets.  First, the service wasn't all that great. We had to wait on our waiter to bring our drinks for a while a couple of times and the restaurant wasn't busy at all. We still gave him about an 18% tip, but was still not that impressed.  Second, the food wasn't as great as everyone makes it out to be. The burgers were good but not anything special. We also had the pretzel sticks for an appetizer and they were phenomenal. We also had the cannoli nachos for dessert and they were amazing as well.  Other than that, this place is well worth the trip. I like the fact that they use a lot of local vendors for their restaurant."}
{"text":"Not impressed, the place is loud. The service was marginal (it was really busy that night). The food was meh. The beer needs to be a LOT better to make up for all that. ick."}
{"text":"Beer A++++ -- Service A+++ -- Food A+++ -- Beards A++  A MUST try for GREAT Easy Valley unique beers!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fun ambiance.  Great service.  The brisket burger was a bit dry.  I have to say that Chuck Box is a much better burger.  The duck fat fries were good.  I liked how crispy they were and the rosemary on top.  I also had super high expectations from the reviews.  I starved myself for hours before eating here."}
{"text":"I'm from Colorado and we have craft breweries everywhere. We visited a few while in Phoenix and AZ Wilderness has the best atmosphere. Excellent beer- I loved the sophomoric IPA. Really good food- superb burgers! Fun people, too. If I lived here, This is where I would be."}
{"text":"Had lunch today ...nice place..outside seating..problem...music so loud could not hear...speakers in all 4 corners of patio...server advise music was manager choice and he is 32 yrs old...advised he may want to think about his customers demographics and adjust as needed....understand loud for happy hour and later but during day during the week..not necessary..won't be coming back..."}
{"text":"Checked this place out due to a high recommendation from a friend that used to live in Scottsdale. He said this place should be top on my list to check out!  We showed up on a Friday night and I was pleasantly surprised that the wait was only 15 minutes. While we waited we went up to the bar to order a flight. A community table behind the bar opened up so we sat there and promptly helped by an employee. He helped guide us through the beer menu which landed on us picking 5 beers, each of a different style.   Pretty much after our flight was served our table was ready. We had to close out at the bar before getting our seat, which is always a bit annoying but I get it.  We were sat at a table outside under the heat lamp. It was nice and cozy and the heat lamp was much needed.  We didn't focus a whole lot on the food menu but ordered frenched wings. I have never had frenched wings so I was curious to try. I definitely like the frenched style wing, super easy to eat but was not all that excited by the wings. I was hungry so I definitely ate them all.  The beers were nothing to write home about. A solid 3 out 5 across the board. If I tried other beers within the beer styles I am sure I could have found one that I absolutely loved.  The ambiance here is great and something people should come here for.  The biggest shocker was that I like getting glassware from breweries I check out. There weren't any pint glasses available and only teku glasses. Call me a fool, but I didn't ask the price before checking out. I was taken aback by the glass being $16 but felt committed and got it anyway. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"I'm going to review the food and beer rather than the service to begin.. The beer is great, unique, from locally sourced ingredients and ever changing. The food is also very good. It is pricey, but worth it, for me. The service is, for lack of a better word, abysmal. Always behind, definitely don't go if you're hungry or can't wait awhile. The waitstaff is snippy and rude, I'm sure it comes from being slammed constantly. I can't even blame them. They seem to have grown their business without a plan to expand their space or waitstaff to ensure a good customer experience. Unfortunately we only go rarely, due to that fact. I hope they can offer a better experience in the future that rivals the quality of their food and beer."}
{"text":"Just spent almost 4 hours at this brewery and can't say enough about the beer, the food, management, you name it! Arrived at 430 and was quoted an hour and 15 min for our size party. Proceeded to the tap room, and the gentlemen taking care of us were awesome! Best coffee stout I have had! The rest of our party showed up an hour later (including elderly grandparents and our 3 children), checked in with hostess and was told she was just waiting for people to leave. Ended up waiting almost 2 hours for our table but manager, Nick, was wonderful! Ended up asking a couple to move to a smaller table (bought them a round), sat us right away and bought us a round. Our server, Mary, was so friendly and gave us superior customer service despite how busy they were. All employees greeted us with smiles, and Nick kept checking in on us to make sure we were happy.  Thank you for providing excellent customer service, and we will definitely be back! Thank you Nick for ensuring our family night out was a success and for being so KIND!!  Quick food favs: Pigs fly French fries A+  Poutine fries A+  Pretzel A+  No complaints on food either!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The atmosphere is unique and beautiful. The food is one of a kind. The beer is always good. If you haven't gone go!"}
{"text":"After a long day of hiking, we love to hit up this spot. The \"great outdoors\" theme adds to greatness of the Arizona Wilderness. The duck fries are to die for! Always a friendly staff, and it doesn't matter how busy it is, the food is always served in a decent amount of time. \"July 11th\" IPA is to die for when it is in rotation!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I wish it was closer to our house. But it's not. So we have to pace ourselves when we make the trek out here! Fave brews: Big Guy Rye; Little Guy Rye; BWBW (Bear Wallow Berliner Weisse) My absolute go to brew! AND in the fall we made it out for the Pecan Pie Porter. Brett (one of the owners) explained all that went into the brewing of this fantastic porter. ALOT! It's a treat. This brewery is not your typical and I love that. It's clean and all the brews are skillfully crafted. Build your own  burger. We have had the brisket and the chicken and you add your own flair with cheeses, sauces, toppings and the bun, even. We share because its a big one! Love the pretzels and cheese too! My only downfall is they are a little heavy on the salt. I scratch it off and none left. Not a problem! Get a growler of your favorite brew because know this, if it turns out to be a favorite, it won't last long! No worries, another one will be along soon to tempt your brew taste buds!"}
{"text":"The food at this place is to die for. I had their garlic fries and wings, both of which are soaked and or fried in duck fat. Believe me when I tell you, cooking with duck fat is the best thing to ever happen. The wings fall off the bone, crispy skin with a great flavor. Their fries are the bomb, the garlic aioli it comes with is amazing. The only reason I don't give them five stars is because I'm not always impressed with their beer selection for lighter palates, surprisingly. I am not a hops lover, I'm sure their IPA and pale ales are great, but they just don't do much for me. This last trip, they luckily had a saison out that was fantastic, but when I was there a few months ago, they didn't have any wheat or light beer that fits my tastes. But that won't deter me from visiting because the food is so good."}
{"text":"The best dry rub chicken wings I've ever tasted!  Craft Beers are awesome,great place to go!"}
{"text":"This place is hands-down one of the best spots in Chandler (and Phoenix, really) for burgers and beer.  I've been here numerous times and never been disappointed in service or quality.  Their brews are always tasty and rotated regularly.  The place doesn't have the best acoustics so it's a little loud when they're busy as others have noted, so sometimes the patio is the best bet."}
{"text":"It's a nice enough place, cozy inside and a outdoor patio with misters. I went there with my Girlfriend Monday night and it wasn't very crowded, however the all wood interior (including the ceilings) made a crowd of 30 people sound like a super bowl stadium at half time.   Honestly I wasn't crazy about the fries that everyone is raving about. Ok, so they are fried in duck fat, that's neat. but they were really soggy and the flavor was kinda overbearing. also the dish that I ordered (fries with pulled pork and beer cheese on top) was so salty I couldn't taste the pork.  The beer is good, but a little too overdone for my taste. The service however was outstanding. Our waitress was right on top of everything we needed before we even know we needed it. I'll probably go back and try another dish, perhaps it was just an off night. if so I'll update my review."}
{"text":"Finally, great beer! Delicious food, friendly service. The poutin is out of this world! The wait wasn't too bad, and you can have a beer while your waiting, so it's bearable."}
{"text":"The food is simply amazing. They often will use locally sourced ingredients in both food and beer.  Atmosphere is kind of hipster, sports bar, and outdoors.  PB&J burger was an interesting add to the menu, but once I tried it, I was impressed.  I have a hard time staying out of the hummus, but the chicken wings confit is probably my favorite thing on the menu."}
{"text":"You know how you're at a party and you can't seem to get more than a few steps from the food table without circling back for Just One More scoop of the most excellent ARTICHOKE DIP?  Ya, it's like that!  Double dip on the First chip to establish your territory!  The chip to dip ratio is perfect if you break each chip in half and heavy load it.  Did the only thing you CAN do when faced with a local brewery and multiple tap handles - had the taster flight.  All tasty. All lived up to their description.   END with the porter, its the dessert beer worth waiting for!    Think Local, Drink Local and try the Artichoke Dip!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I've been coming since they only took up half of the building they currently occupy. The fries and meatloaf sliders are my recommendations! The wait can sometimes be long on a nice day. However you can always go get a beer at the bar while you wait. The food and drink is always worth the wait! Love this local place!"}
{"text":"Great mico brew place, not as good as 4 peaks or stone though."}
{"text":"Goodmornin burger was dry, chips have no flavor, I'm not sure how the service was. We didn't get any. Then they tried to add other tables meals on our checks. Never again."}
{"text":"Truly loved this place. It was busy on a Sunday afternoon, but for good reason. The beer is amazing and the food was equally impressive. We live close by so we will be back very soon! They also have a dog friendly patio which is a huge plus. If you love trying new beers and some great pub food you need to try this place."}
{"text":"I'm excited for these guys. Visited for the first time earlier this week and was pleasantly surprised by everything: my IPA was hoppy, crisp, and clean; burgers were delicious and cooked to order; decor is far better than I expected; and the staff was friendly and very knowledgeable.  The food menu could use a little beefing up but I expect they'll grow it over time.  I'm ready to come back!"}
{"text":"Quite the popular place, so don't journey here hoping to get fast food paced service. Their crafty brews are world class and the meatloaf sliders have hit the spot for me on several occasions.    Get a flight and enjoy the night."}
{"text":"Hands down best craft beers, (especially sours) burgers, pulled pork & fries in the East Valley!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today...only second time in 9 months...for shame!  Beertender was Adam...Fantastic Friendly chap!!  Very detailed and informative about my flight!!  One of the owners showed up during my visit, also a friendly guy!!  Liked what I saw, what I drank and the company today....definitely coming back!!  Thanks Az Wilderness!!"}
{"text":"Great food isn't what gets me to go to a restaurant again, but great service is! The manager (Allie) and my waitress (Alisa) managed to turn around an icky situation, and make it into one the-parts-of-my-family-that-worked-in-food-service would be proud of. Within seconds, my food was replaced, and Allie at our table making up for the slip. Everyone makes mistakes, not many care to truly make up for them, and only a handful ever turn mistakes into success--with that said, both of these gals deserve a raise! (or else the company risks other establishments stealing a couple truly phenomenal employees)."}
{"text":"They burgers here are phenomenal! No joke! Staff is knowledgeable about the beer selections they offer and the the menu."}
{"text":"Such a cute and eclectic place! The service was top notch our server Kailyn (I think) was so sweet and helpful! It was our first time here and she answered all of our questions easily. We'll definitely be back!! The beer is pretty damn good too!"}
{"text":"I came to this place for happy hour almost a year ago, and I've been wanting to come back and try the food ever since! We finally made it out there last night, and unfortunately it wasn't as good as I was expecting.   I do like their beer, we got the Arrastra Belgian Golden Strong and it was great! It took forever to get them though, we waited almost 30 minutes. They were busy, but it seemed like it shouldn't have taken that long.   For dinner we ordered burgers, I got the Hawaiian one and my boyfriend built his own. Those were really good, I didn't like the sauce on the Hawaiian but that's just my opinion and next time I'd try something else :) the fries are really good, too, they just have a bit too much rosemary sometimes.   One major thing I didn't like about this place was that they charge quite a bit for everything... $2.50 to get fries instead of chips, all the add ons for burgers are pricey, and they charge $1 for sauce! I was overcharged for a burger topping, and they charged us a $1 for BBQ sauce and brought habanero mustard instead... so I didn't like that.   Overall, had the service been a little better I think it would have been fine. I'll definitely have to try coming back before I'd say this place is bad :) I think it may have just been a bad night."}
{"text":"We love this brewery - if only there was one closer to home! The duck fat fries + garlic aioli are my favorite. The burgers are wonderful, flights of beer on logs are fun, and the energetic ambiance is great as well. I really enjoyed the coffee stout this past trip, but have tried flights of beer each time I've visited. The bacon and bleu burger was amazing, but I'd definitely upgrade to the fries from here on out!  There is almost always a wait, so make sure you send your least favorite friend ahead of the group to put your name on the list! :D JK, maybe you can call ahead and make a reservation? I guess we'll see next time we make it out there."}
{"text":"Love this place. The merica are where its at, dont forget to ask for the habanero sauce to dip them in too"}
{"text":"Amazing food, friendly service. You need to have the duck fat fries, simply the best fries I have ever had. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"IF YOU LIKE CRAFT BREWS DON'T MISS OUT ON THIS ONE!  Been dying to finally get out to Gilbert and give this place a try but we hesitated due to it being out in Gilbert  DIRECTIONS - DISTANCE: **** To my surprise the drive from Oldtown Scottsdale wasn't bad at all - about 15 mins - straight down the 101 to E Guadalupe Rd and you're there! SO WORTH IT and not a bad drive at all.   =====================================================  ATMOSPHERE: ***** Great atmosphere out of nowhere - you can't really tell what to expect walking up but once your inside you feel like you're right on Mill Ave w/ out the sometimes expected Douchery which is great - everyone is laid back - good diverse mix of patrons and overall good vibe. They had the World Cup playing on all the TVs which scores extra points!  ========================================================  FOOD: **** I ended up just combining some starters - I went with the CHICKEN WINGS CONFIT, dry rub with Beer-B-Q sauce on the side (Delicious). The meat literally falls of the bone. And I had a side of the BELGISCHE FRIETJES (which is fries cooked in duck fat).... so good.  Also - they have vegetarian options as well which was a plus for some of our party.  Great Beer food overall   =========================================================  BEER: ***** + * While the menu is limited this is why you make the trip people - I had the:  - Denmark in The Desert Imperial Sour Peach Porter Collab with Mikkeller - (not a porter guy in 100+ temps but I gotta say that this was pretty awesome) Not overly dark or thick - very smooth and has a great aftertaste... goes great w/ the FRIETJES.   - Hellsgate Imperial Saison - 9.0% - What can I say about the Imperial - Was as good as it gets!!! Make sure you have a designated driver for this one :)  AGAIN Don't make the trip if you're expecting to be able to buy a Heineken - that's not going to happen and that's not what the place is about - this is a Micro Brew trying new flavors and constantly coming out w/ new craft brews - that's the point!!!   ==========================================================  SERVICE: ***** Last but not least the staff was awesome - They kept the fresh cold beer flowing despite the place being packed out - made great recommendations for everyone on the food - pairing it up with our beers - couldn't have been happier   WE'LL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"First I want to say that I may come back and revise this review because I'm pregnant so I won't be reviewing the alcohol, but the food.... I had the AZ trail burger with onion rings. My husband the same but with fries & daughter had the quesadilla with fruit. The buns were pretzel buns & smaller than the patties. It wasn't soft like I've had at other locations and the patties were bland. I feel like they depended on the drizzle of the sauce to give the rest of the ingredients flavor. It had a bit of spice to it & it was good but the bun not being so soft and the party being a bit bland the bacon & sauce weren't enough. The onion ring had an okay taste to the batter but I guess I was expecting crispy since it looked like it would be, but it was soft. Not soggy so there's potential in it.  Fruit was good and sliced perfectly for my 3 year old. The quesadilla was okay. The cheese was melted through and the tortilla tasted & looked like a mission tortilla. I don't blame her for not wanting to eat more than 1 slice. The food wasn't Bad - it just isn't impressive. It does the job... Maybe we'll be back once I can try the beer."}
{"text":"I liked the environment - the decor, tables and seating available was nice. The hostesses were polite, but service wasn't spectacular or anything out of the ordinary.   Our server was also polite and helpful with choosing beer. There was one beer I enjoyed (out of the 5 we chose), the rest were just alright. I'm not a huge beer advocate and tend to go for the lighter beers, so perhaps I'm not the best to judge. (Headin' West was my fave).   I got the pork belly sliders and the flavor of the toppings were good, but I think I'm just not a fan of pork belly. The texture was a little weird and I wouldn't get it again.   My boyfriend got a cheeseburger, and the meat was super flavorful and great. I had regrets and wish I had gotten a burger. The fries were OK as well. I didn't really like the flavor,  but when I dumped it in ketchup the fry was much better! HA.   I'm not sure if I was just having an off-day with my taste buds or if my expectations were too high. I would like to try it again, and probably get a burger or the green chili sliders like some other comments mentioned. And I wouldn't waste money on the flight of beers, but rather get one Headin' West. I'm giving 4 stars because I can see the potential in this restaurant, just not sure if I ordered the right things."}
{"text":"The food was horrible! I had fries and chicken wings and the fries take very heavy like they were 2 days old and used 2 week old vegetable oil.  They really need to use coconut oil if they advertise as \"local,fresh philosophy\" and the chicken wings were battered in a awful taste, I had to soak it in sauce so it can taste somewhat good. The wings at scottsdale brewery were 10 times better!  The only thing that tasted good was the beer, how can you go wrong with that."}
{"text":"Awesome food and even better beer. This is the spot right here. The trail burger is a must have with the belgeisch fries. The tasting room is a nice addition and more recently always have new beers to try for my monthly visit. This place practices true hand crafted beer."}
{"text":"Agree with other reviewers..duck fat fries!!! YUM!  The beers are fantastic and burgers are excellent.  I always leave here too full and promise to split a burger upon my return, but between visits I lose my resolve and rinse and repeat.  This is a testament to the delicious food and beer!"}
{"text":"A great place for brews and burgers. A bit of a wait but worth it. The peanut butter and jalapeño jelly burger sounds strange but it's really good. I want to try a few of the others. Locally sourced, the beers are great."}
{"text":"Yum! Husband and I got the beer flight and tacos. They do an awesome job! If you like beer, at all, go there now."}
{"text":"Great beer and incredibly friendly people as well. Kid friendly and plenty of areas to sit. Only complaint is that it takes a while to be seated and the music is too loud if you're trying to have any sort of conversation."}
{"text":"I love that this place is dog friendly! I love taking my two dogs here and enjoying a nice cold brew! I love the pecan pie beer and the duck fat fries are amazing! They also do military discount which can be hard to find"}
{"text":"First, I have to compliment the service. I have been in approx 10 times and have always had amazing service. That being said, I can't say much about the menu. That is only because, on my first visit I ordered the jalapeno meatloaf sliders with sriracha ketchup and I have not been able to order anything else since. They are quite possible the best slider I have ever had. They don't come with a side but a basket of onion rings makes this dish more than enough. The beer is fantastic and they have a giant chalkboard on the wall with all of the local purveyors they use. Stay classy AZ Wilderness. Cheers.."}
{"text":"Excellent brews, delicious food, and an outgoing, yet relaxing, atmosphere. Their wings (dry rub) and their pretzels are absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"This new brewery really has promise.  The staff was great and really friendly.  We sampled all six beers. I like the concept of each beer being named after a wilderness area in Arizona.  High marks for their IPA. I'm not usually a fan of the hops but this was really balanced and drinkable.  All of their beers had little quirks but I definitely like where they are going and what they are trying to do.  We only tried the duck far fries. They were good but not super hot. Makes me think they were not made just for us but sat under a lamp for a few minutes.  The inside area was pretty noisy, even though it wasn't that full.  I'd definitely return to try their beers as they move forward."}
{"text":"I returned on a normal day, and behold a table and service!  The beer again was great, I had a stout and it was all a stout should be, very balanced. The food at least my veggie burger was not the best, dry and low on flavor a real carb bomb.   Come in enjoy the bearded men they don't bite and drink the beer, as for eating I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"So, I guess everybody is a restaurant/brewery/culinary expert these days.  I have been eating and drinking at AZWB for six months. Call me a regular. Their beer is an expression of the minds of the brewers. True, it is hard to get the exact same beer month after month, so if you have a favorite, it will be a while until you taste the exact same beer again. BUT, what you will find is: beer faithful to their intended style with local twists, staff knowledgeable in the styles on tap, and locally sourced food that complements the beers available. If you have a question, just ask. If the server cant answer it, there is definitely someone on hand who can suitably help.   Noise? It is a bar. After 5pm, the noise level picks up. Deal with it. It is very busy on Thursday/Friday/Saturday nights. That is what happens when a noted beer rating company rates a brewery as the \"World's Best New Brewery\".  Kid friendly? My 9yos like the build-a-burger. Again, remember you are at a bar.   Adult food? I like everything they have on the menu. Again, the brewmasters have put their heart and soul in to what is coming out of the taps. The food selection is better than just \"bar food\" in my opinion, and again, they try to make taste appealing foods that complement the beer selection. They offer pairing suggestion on the menu.   Bartenders Chris and Matt are extremely sharp on the tap offerings and Brewmaster Jonathan will tell you anything you would like to know. While I may not appreciate every beer \"style\" they embrace, I have not had a bad tasting experience yet.   Try one of everything, repeat often."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great food great beer and great atmosphere!! Get the duck fat fries supper tasty. All the people working where super helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Since I'm not a beer drinker I can't comment on the beer, however my husband was pleased. The burgers are all cooked to medium which were very tasty but I wish they would accommodate cooking to order as I like my burgers med. rare!! The duck fat fries sprinkled with rosemary and thyme were good.  The atmosphere was nice with a good mix if clientele. We'll be back..."}
{"text":"We finally got in!!!!  This is our 4th attempt to get in here and it took a Monday afternoon at 4 to  get in. Started with the IPA.....very good. Me and my girl split a jalapeño jelly and PB burger that was off the chain!!  Great fries with it too!!!  Our little waitress was kick ass! So if I come here again, I must come early, thats the key!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, friendly service, but a bit disappointed they had run out of their stout. The IPA was good however and my wife enjoyed her Pecan Pie Brown. Tried an order of their soft pretzel sticks. Way too bready and over priced for the 3 pieces you get. We will definitely go back next time we are in Gilbert however to try the stout and maybe a different appetizer or an entree."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for breweries, they tend to have the best food around for the most part. Very fun atmosphere and although I don't drink they had a lot of beers to choose from. I went there for lunch and ordered a burger that had a jalapeno cream cheese spread as a topping and enjoyed it immensely. A must have! The onion rings were excellent as well. Nothing bad to say about this place at all as the staff was great too. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Excellent beer and food menu, if you are a beer lover this is the place to go in AZ, they are always introducing new beers and they classics are awesome, if that wasn't all their food menu is locally sourced and great quality and taste"}
{"text":"Food is awesome. Beers are delicious. Unique brews. Love the staff and atmosphere. We go all the time! Duck fat fries is all you need to know...LOL  Also love that they use as many local resources and vendors as possible!!"}
{"text":"We went for a very late lunch and so we decided to order appetizers. BEST IDEA EVER!!! we shared the pork sliders ( Amazing) and Artichoke Dip ( Also Amazing ) and we even split a Sweet Potato Beer ( bad choice we should have had our own because, YES it was AMAZING) ok so the only down part is it felt like we waited a-w-h-i-l-e for our food, but I think this is not  to fair because we were starving.  However, I loved the music. It was a very busy place but we can see why. Oh and just a side note, I don't drink beer but when I go here I will !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the location.  Gilbert needs this.  Like the atmosphere.  Staff is friendly.  Love the variety of beer and the brewer's willingness to make different beers than just standard IPA, Amber, etc (Though they still have those).  For example, the first Saison was delicious!  However, my \"complaints\" would be that while all their beers are good and I have enjoyed trying each of them, none have stood out to me as excellent or provided me with that wow factor.      Also, I know they are probably brewing smaller batches of beer than some of the other breweries here in AZ but I find it somewhat strange that they don't have a consistent rotation of beers that I could count on getting  every single time in addition to some seasonal or special brews..  For example, their BWBW or Little Guy Rye I would think is available at all times.  But its not.    Anyway, AZWB Co. is a welcome addition to  the craft brew scene and especially to Gilbert.  I have not tried any of the food yet but it looks and smells good."}
{"text":"Visited AZW on a Wed night; during HH... it was packed. Put our name on the list for a table; est. 15-20 min. wait. Decided to mosey over to the bar tender and order beers; the patio was empty and it was 108 but it was shaded so we figured we could handle that for 15-20 mins. The bar tender gave us some suggestions based on what we were looking for... the hubby was interested in a sour but she knew better to have him taste it first, it was not for him so he found something more to his palette.     - Expect a little wait for a table during HH.   We let the hostess know we were heading outside while we waited for a table. A few minutes later more arrived to the patio and the next thing we know these massive coolers on the patio were turned on... nice and cool with them. 108 became very comfortable on the shaded patio.    - Don't fear the patio in the summer; with the patio coolers on it's nice out there.  We wanted a snack so we ordered the FLYIN' BELGIAN PIG IN BEER CHEESE for $8.99. It was plenty for 2 to share; with the beers and this snack my hubby and I were full. We asked for a side of ranch and the waiter (with the fun handlebar mustache) also provided some BEER-B-Q sauce (also yummy).    - Food portions are decent and the wait staff is friendly and quick.  With another visit my 4 star would probably change to a 5 star; I'd like to sample more of the food and the beers too... at this point - the rating is more like 4.5!"}
{"text":"Went out for dinner with the hubby & our friends. We've been hearing about AZ Wilderness Brewing Co for a long time, but the first 2 times we went it was over 2 hrs for a table...this time we got lucky! I started off the night with their IPA, which was delicious. Once we were seated, our table ordered the pretzels sticks & cheese. The pretzels sticks themselves were cooked to perfection-crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. The cheese, however, was extremely salty and was not a good match for the pretzels. For dinner, I ordered the Hawaiian wilderness burger, but subbed pulled pork instead. When the dinner came, I swear I thought mine was salad..not a very good presentation of burger & my side salad. I had ordered raspberry vinaigrette but they brought me the beer vinaigrette instead, which was a blessing because the raspberry vinaigrette was just a cold pinkish substance with no taste. The pork was yummy, but I didn't love the sauce or the fact that I couldn't bite into the pineapple on my sandwich because it was so hard. Overall, no one in our group was too impressed with the food. The beer is a do again, but nothing else.  Side note for the gluten free people out there: there is no other alcohol option besides beer. Our friend was super disappointed she couldn't get anything to drink because they didn't have a full bar"}
{"text":"When we bought a house in Gilbert I was sad that we would no longer be a 5 minute drive away from Santan...and then I found AZ Wilderness! I stumbled onto this place about a month after it opened when it popped up on \"near by\" in Untapped, it has since become immensely popular. It's a little more difficult to get a table these days but definitely worth the wait. I love that they are constantly trying new things with the beer and food! We were fortunate enough to get a growler of the pecan picacho, I'm really hoping they do it every year, as it was amazing! The coffee stout and little guy rye are both great staples and I have never eaten anything there that I didn't enjoy.  Seriously, the brisket burger, chicken burger, pulled pork, chicken wings...all delicious, and who could say no to duck fat fries??"}
{"text":"Great place to stop for a few unique beers. Food was great as well with friendly courteous staff. During weekends wait could be a min due to the building space but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"It's alright. it's like that feeling when you order something based on what it sounds like and you don't like at any other reviews and you really should have looked at the reviews.   It would have been in your best interest to look at the reviews. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. The veggie burger with hummus. It was kind of dry.  The hostesses were awkward? Maybe I was awkward? idk it just wasn't welcoming if that is your first time and the staff is looking at you like why are you here..   The pros were: the atmosphere, the interior, the waiter, it's local.  Just an average experience and average way to spend your birthday."}
{"text":"Wow, has this placed improved over the past year. Their new tasting room has over 15 rotating beers on tap. Fantastic! Love this place, best new brewery in the valley.   While the beers, food, and service continue to improve, consistency on all fronts will earn them them a solid 5 stars.   One Negative ... they need to remove the low wood ceiling in the main venue, it's by far the loudest room I have ever sat in.  I measured a constant 100db with my iPhone amp ... even louder if they have a Hyena in-house. This \"will\" cause hearing loss over an extended period. OSHA would shut them down immediately ... if they found out! (Owners ... please remedy this situation)"}
{"text":"Kinda loud is some places! Great patio for families!!! Staff and manager were very nice and welcoming us! Our new favorite brewery for sure!!! We will be back! Beers are great! I got a sour wine/beer and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"The best burger I have ever had.   Great menu,  good beers and the staff was awesome.  Will be back and spreading the word"}
{"text":"A group of us 4 came here Saturday evening to have dinner & beers. Both food and drinks were great! The sampler of (5) beers was a good choice. You can or can't go wrong ordering samplers its just how it is but the price here was too good! And being familiar with beer makes it more assuring. I'll go back."}
{"text":"Sliders and duck fat fries??? Drop the mike! Even without the beer it's worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Very unique place in all the best ways. Pork plus gravy plus fried fried in duck fat is incredible. Once had a sweet potato beer and it was perfect. Gets busy in the evenings but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great beer, very good apple/brie/bacon burger, and everyone who worked there was extremely nice. I will definitely be back. Additionally, please open another location near Scottsdale so I can come by weekly."}
{"text":"What can I say every time I have been here the food surpasses my expectations! And the beer gets better and better every time as it continuously changes! The wife and I came for a late night dinner & as usual food was amazing thank you !"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Very friendly staff.  I had a slight problem but they handled it perfectly.  The food is great.  The beer selection is phenomenal.  Lindsay is the best!"}
{"text":"Beer wasn't better than other nearby breweries.  Bathrooms were a mess and no toilet paper in the female bathroom."}
{"text":"We have been here numerous times and love it. The beer is awesome, but not for those looking for a Coors Light. You'll need to drink the real stuff to find a beer you like.   The food has always been great. Try the Pork Belly Sliders and Cannoli Nachos.   Service has been good most times but occasionally can be on the slow side. They've been slammed busy every time we are there so I've given a bit of slack on that."}
{"text":"Great beer and very nice people.  Very different appetizers and food.  The outdoor seating is relaxing and dog friendly.  The beer is very unique and the description of the beer are spot on.  Some examples are beet beer, squash beer and beer that cardamom is used.  Really worth swinging by!"}
{"text":"Grubbed with the hubs here. Good burgers & trying new bread pudding - not yet on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The servers are friendly as hell, the food is amazing, that the beers are great. The put so much care into everything they do and already recommend this place to everyone I know :)"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Az brewery and one of the top ones in the States. Every beer is outstanding and they are doing Sours the right way. Make sure to get the pretzel sticks or one of the great burgers."}
{"text":"Let me temper my review with the knowledge that I am not a beer drinker, but boyfriend and my friend visiting from out of town are.  Over all, even being a small microbrew place, every single beer was pretty heavy.  Not even one light offering for the less bold among us.  The foot was tasty but very difficult to eat.  My burger was a flavorful mess.  Would probably go again if we lived closer to try another batch of beer offerings."}
{"text":"When did AZ get so crafty?   If I lived here, this would be my, \"Cheers\". Plenty of tasty beer, great food, and cute customer service for days. I came here with my uncle, who I found out is pretty much, \"the mayor\" in this joint. He showed me the craft beer ropes, with some savory samplings as well.   We started with the Refuge IPA, which is a solid IPA and great way to start your palate off right. Not too hoppy, very smooth and great flavor. We also had the Estrella Pale Ale, perfect for snacking or just drinking round-for-round while chatting with friends. We kept it to these two beers because we had obligations later in the day and couldn't get to squirrely.   Besides great beer, Wilderness also makes some mean bar food. We ordered Bavarian Pretzel Sticks, which is 3 Soft Pretzel Sticks with Butter, Sea Salt. And served with Beer Cheese and Beer Mustard. This is the best bread stick you'll ever eat and it's a pretzel! Super soft and buttery, sorry to current GF, I may have a another love in my life.   After the orgasmic pretzel/ butter love affair. We anteed up the carbs with the Flyin' Belgian Pig. This is pulled pork over a basket of Belgische Frietjes (french fries) drizzled with Beer Cheese. Fries + Meat + Beer Cheese = Awkward food boner. The pulled pork was seasoned to perfection and super tender. The beer cheese was magnificent and definitely not a meal for the fitness fanatic.   Great place, great vibes, and I highly recommend this place if you live in the hood or visiting for the weekend."}
{"text":"Great peanut butter and jalapeño jelly burger and FAB craft beer. Take a growler with you, you'll want more later."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday after I had contacted them through facebook to see if they were kid friendly...they aren't.  There's 1 high chair, no kid menu. Checked out their menu, there wasn't anything on there that I could even make a meal out of for my son. and get this, the waitress suggested fruit and fries as dinner options for my son. Really? No, thanks.   We ordered the street tacos, everything in it was cold.   Good for groups, couples and happy hour. families with kids avoid coming here. They don't have a sign up yet and it was a tad bit hard to find, the apartments behind them were shady too.   We won't be back, I'd rather drive to Phoenix and eat/drink at Ohso."}
{"text":"The first time we came here the place was packed and there was a 30 minute wait (with no waiting area) so we left. We decided to come back the minute the place opened on a Friday to make sure we got a seat and we were not the only people waiting in the parking lot. We shared a delicious burger and the best wings I have ever had. I recommend trying this place! It will not disappoint. There is a reason why it is always so busy."}
{"text":"Everyone hates me for this.... Buttttttt I don't really like this place.  I mean it is a cool environment, the service is good and everyone is nice. However the food is not good at all, and I don't drink beer. So I can't really rate based off the beer. However, I have not ordered food since trying it because I was that unimpressed and they don't really have many options.  Also the last time I went the bathroom was pretty gross. I would expect them to be a little more updated and definitely cleaner. Seemed weird that the whole bin of cleaning products just sits on the floor in there under the sink. And the sink looks nasty."}
{"text":"Good food, beer, and services.   If you ever wonder, I wish I could have someone usales me on stuff that I don't really need and end up paying 25-30% of more on basically the same item, I would be so happy, this is the right restaurant for you.   You can order two burgers and a kids meal and end up paying more than 25% or more of essentially the same food. Ecstatic!! Don't forget there are more updates that you can have too, such as a \"special\" local beer, or \"local beer\" or \"local coecoe poo\".   After out bill, you can see the number of up sales vs the regular food price. I was ecstatically that I can finally spend more on bar food instead of fine dinning but end up paying much more than what was expected.   You have to be careful to read the little fine print thpigj, otherwoze you will miss the opportunity to pay more for essentially the same food.."}
{"text":"best brewery in arizona by far and excellent food."}
{"text":"First time here, black bean tacos are really good.  Also tried superstition coffee stout, was pretty good"}
{"text":"Top five list of best burgers! I tried the Reuben Burger and it was perfect. Our server was super friendly and patient with us first timers: )  When I'm up for a good burger I will definitely return. It's a cozy warm atmosphere good for both families or a friendly group."}
{"text":"Decent food, but only drink if you like weirdness in your beer.  We came on a Friday night. The place is tiny, but warm & hospitable. The food was actually pretty good. They serve pretzel bun burgers & chicken sandwiches. It's cooked well but nothing to write home about. The duck fat fries pretty much taste like regular fries. Pass the salt & ketchup because there's no seasoning or flavor to them other than a fried potato. They charge extra for those, too.  But when we go to a brewery, we want to dig into the beer. That's what we go for, right? This place tries really hard to be different and set itself apart...too hard. In a word, the beer here is \"presumptuous\". The descriptions are lengthy and \"out there\" and you really have no idea what you're getting or what to expect. The servers are very friendly and do talk about the beer, but it's impossible to solidly describe these beers because you can't nail them down. We love good, honest craft beer and can appreciate a good brew even if it's not our favorite type. At this place, we didn't even finish them. It's not that they tasted bad, they just tasted...weird. Too weird. We tried a couple different beers each. After I got mine, I went back and re-read the descriptions on the list again. What I tasted was nothing like what I read, and I believe the reason why is that there is just soooo much going on in one brew that everything gets lost. Every beer is described as having more than a few high notes. Of course, when you try to do too much at once, what you end up with is cacophony.  After reading a few other reviews of the place, I think the weirdness of the beer is what people are referring to as \"trying to be hip & trendy\". The atmosphere wasn't hipster at all. It was a nice, rustic beer joint, and the burgers aren't \"fancy\" or avant garde. There was a diverse group of people there, but where it fell into the \"trendy\" trap for us was the beer. There's a lot going on in the beer that you don't usually see in your average craft brewery...and maybe there's a reason why you don't usually see it. Also, we were told by another couple sitting across the high bar from us that the place rotates brews quite rapidly. I gather that means that even if we'd found something we liked, it might not be there next time, and we'd have to start the process over. In short, I would eat here again for sure, but I'd probably just have a Coke with it."}
{"text":"Best craft beer around, the food is great too. I have tried several burgers on the menu and all of them were fantastic. Great environment and service is always good."}
{"text":"Did the PBJ burger, which is peanut butter and jalapeno jam and duck fat fries. Unique but the flavors were lacking. Duck fat fries were a couple bucks extra and I couldn't tell a difference. Great beer selection, good service, high energy atmosphere . Just needs more of a wow for the food side. I'd try it again. Priced well."}
{"text":"locally brewed using local products to make great beer. Friendly staff, awesome fries. Website shows what beer is available. Wish it was closer to me."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about the work these guys have been doing. Their beers are just phenomenal and get so much flavor. I think the best example of this is that I am not a sour beer fan but I try them from time to time, AZWBC maybe the only place where I have tried the sours and actually ordered a full beer; and not only that but I have done so multiple times.  These guys are always coming up with new flavors for beer and the full range from sours to sweet stouts are incredible.  For all the credit they get for their beers the food here is just as good and makes the whole experience complete. My favorite are the frenched wings, which are chicken wings but more done in the style of rack of lamb with the nice trimmed bone at the top to grab onto. They are amazingly flavorful (I like the sweet and spicy) and literally fall off the bone tender, like watch out tender because the bone can slide right out as the chicken just melts in your mouth. The sliders are also great. I also had the taco tuesday tacos last week and for a guy who isn't a fan of fruit in his food I loved the grilled pineapple with the curry chicken taco.  Doesn't matter if you come for the beer or the food this place is a winner."}
{"text":"Some aspects of the food here are truly genius.  The Peanut Butter & Jalapeno Jelly burger is beautifully balanced and fascinating - top 2 burgers I've ever had.  Arizona Trail Burger also made with ingredients that complement each other beautifully.  After The Hike Burger has all the right ingredients, but I feel like they're better deconstructed than together.  Beet and apple salad (I omitted the goat cheese) was also a bit of culinary genius.  Duck fat fries are delicious and my favourite (and now more clearly labeled, so as not to dupe our vegetarian friends).  Correct amount of rosemary ...and a perfect level of oversalted where they're addictive.  I tried the Belgian Waffle battered onion rings this time.  On their own, the onion rings are nothing special.  With the Sriracha ketchup, the maple flavour in the waffle batter becomes significantly more apparent.   More importantly, ...the Sriracha ketchup is balanced and delicious. The onion rings are good (when married with the ketchup), but not better than the duck fat fries, IMO.  I have no particular complaints nor any particular praise for the beers I've had.  Service has always been best on the patio."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since the soft opening and its become a fantastic brewery and eatery.  The food is fantastic. My own recommendation is any burger off the menu but replacing the hamburger with a chicken patty. Also, always upgrade to fries (the waffle onion rings are also amazing). The chicken patties are made with rosemary and other spices and they are incredibly delicious. Their fries are fried in duck fat and are very worth the upgrade cost. The onion rings have a waffle batter fry to them and come with a maple sriracha ketchup and are very unique and tasty.   Now for beer. I love their selection. They are constantly rotating new beers on the menu. The only beer they regularly keep on tap is their refuge ipa. They brew all types. I highly recommend their sours, some of the best I've ever had. The brew list typically has a few pale ales, a stout or porter, a saison, a sour, and maybe a few experimental beers (rye, Belgian, etc...). They have the occasional brown or red but not too often. You can check online for their current beer list to see if a style you like is on tap. So far I've loved ever beer I've had here.  Overall it's a place you should definitely check out of you're nearby. The wait can sometimes be a bit long depending on the day/time but I believe it's always worth it."}
{"text":"Every gose they make hear is wonderful. It ceases to amaze me the craft they have for gose. Based on a coworker's recommendation, I tried the pork belly sliders. Good god are those things awesome! The pork belly comes off more like smoked turkey! The pretzel bun has the right amount of salt to satisfy but leaves you just a little thirsty. The bun was also soft and had a nice texture when chewing.  Their pulled pork tacos are pretty good overall. The main contribution to its flavor is the creamy chipotle they add on top. Without the creamy chipotle cream, the taco is nothing special and can be skipped, especially if you ordered something with pulled pork already in it.    The peanut butter and jelly burger is phenomenal. Possibly one of the best burgers I have had. Taste wise, they take a childhood classic and excel it to imaginative heights. The balance of sweet, nutty, and spicy are played so well, it comes off like a cirque du soleil show in my  mouth. I made some slight modifications since last time and I feel it made it even better. Not everyone may agree with me, but I firmly believe having the burger cooked medium rare is the way to go. It made the beef flavor stand on its own without being weighed down by the other flavors. I added avocado and it only made it creamier. The only real complaint I can make is how messy that burger is. In no way should you eat this while wearing fancy clothes or during a first date. I literally wiped my mouth and hands after each bite. Otherwise, this I a burger everyone should try in their lives."}
{"text":"I visit here frequently after a hike. The beer selection is fantastic. The burgers are really as good as the waitress will tell you. It would be my favorite bar if there was more seating. Check it out on a Sunday.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My opinion of this place is going to be a bit off in comparison to others here locally...probably pretty unpopular I am sure. Sue me, but its my opinion...my ELITE opinion, that is...that this place is slightly over-hyped. Why? Check it out.  ~Drinks/Fud~ First off, I have both eaten here and had beers. I have been 3 times at the time of this review, I forgot to check in another time. Honestly, the beers here cater in my mind...directly to beer snobs. There are 3 types of alcohol drinkers: 1-People who could care less, just give me something to drink, 2-I like specific drinks only, I'm pretty picky, and 3-This wine is so dry, where are all of the unborn grapes!?  The 3rd type of person would looooooove this joint. They rarely have a lighter beer option for someone like me who enjoys a flavorful (not fruity or sweet..flavorful) beer without all the bells and whistles. Instead, if you look at the somewhat pompous descriptions of each beer on the menu, its overwhelming and a bit much. Also, they have just a couple options! The other day I went, they had 6 beers on tap..that's it. They try to offer variety in the couple beers offered, but each time I've went I left with just a bland drinking experience. Nothing wows me. I am not a beer snob, but I like my specific beers, and they seem to not cater to my liking.   Their food has a lot of great and yummy highlights, including their burgers. I chose the Mushroom burger and it was outstanding with sauteed onions. The burger/beer pairing led to a better overall experience, sort of. So the food is a definite bright spot, as is the weekly food specials they roll out. I would definitely come here for some food on a fun chill night with friends, and perhaps enjoy a lighter lager/pilsner to down my food with if they were to offer one. The Pilsner they did have the other day btw was less than thrilling...  ~Atmosphere/Service~ I love the outdoor atmosphere here. The staff are attentive and very knowledgeable. Honestly, this is where they earn the bulk of their stars, just a great location just down the road from me and near the 60...easily accessible to most. The outdoors area features misters and is great for a large group to enjoy, or for a low-key first date. Once again, no issues...I love the patio. That is the main reason I keep coming back, mind you.  ~Overall~ I give this place 3 stars, 1 for their food, and 2 for the atmosphere and service. They lose 2 stars because the whole thing the place is built off of (amazing craft beer) just does not do it for me at all... My personal favorite spots are out in Chandler, Arcadia, and Scottsdale respectively, and I gladly will drive out that way to enjoy the wide variety of options there. I must say that Wilderness is only 5 minutes from my place, so its not a difficult sell if friends want to meet up for a quick hangout there. All in all, I have many better options. Sue me, lol."}
{"text":"Me and my entire family went to this wonderful restaurant for lunch. The service was outstanding. The food was top notch. The beer flight was great.     The restaurant has a very laid-back feel. The waitstaff reflected this but at the same time provided excellent service, was knowledgeable about all aspects of the menu, and was well-versed in the  beer selection.  The menu and the food are great. It was lunch and we had mostly burgers among the five of us.  We had a number of appetizers as well. We live on the west side of Phoenix so we thought we better try everything since we weren't sure when we would be back this way. We were so glad we did. The appetizers consisted of  chicken wings, pretzel and  pork belly sliders. The chicken wings may have been the best I've ever had. The pretzel was good. The pork belly sliders might be my meal next time I go.   Finally I had the six beer flight.  It was a wonderful collection of different flavors and styles. Each beer was unique, and each beer was accurately described by both the menu and the waitstaff."}
{"text":"I really enjoy wilderness brewery. I love all the national forest themed decor and the beers are great (in my eyes). I also think their food is superb. It reminds me a lot of the good quality bar food that Four Peaks is known for (or was known for. Depends on what Budweiser does with it I guess).  One thing that is super frustrating with this place is that it is SO small and the parking lot is impossible to get into. I will be incredibly thankful once they get their new location in Gilbert."}
{"text":"So glad I found this brewery in AZ while visiting family!!! Just absolutely loved the beer! Loved the atmosphere! Loved the food!! Great place you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"My favorite brewery in Metro Phoenix. I love the sour options. The peanut butter, jalapeno jelly hamburger is the bomb!!! I won't even try hamburgers at any other restaurants...this one has spoiled me. I like the tasting room most as a seating option, on nice weather days you can hear the live music out on the patio."}
{"text":"Tasted great -- felt like I have been in some Washington forest gnawing on pine cones, trying to survive... that's exactly what their Suit-and-tie IPA tasted like: sappy, thick, piney... I can still taste the needles on my tongue. The Weisse beer was sour. I am not quite sure where they went wrong there, or if their red sour keg had an illicit relationship with weisse, but the two tasted exactly the same: nose-wrinkling tooth-hurting sour. We had four people in the group, and I am the only person who likes sour, so I was a trooper and drank everyone's Weisse as well as my Red Sour. The Stout was, well, a Stout, albeit weak. The IPA was pine-needly as well. If you don't mind scraping sap off your gums, picking needles out of your teeth, and drinking squirrel vomit, you will LOVE it!! Honestly the only reason we went there was because the brewery was lauded as the best brewery in the U.S.!! I say, the worst!! Unless you are a squirrel -- then you will love it!! :-)  One star for beer, and two for atmosphere - atmosphere was great, and if the brews were phenomenal, they would get 5 stars from me. Have not tried their food, so that was not included in my review."}
{"text":"Sour beers and good burgers. I had the az trail one which was very generous and tasty, comes with homemade chips. Drink wise I had the french beer which was not to my liking but then got the japanese one that i enjoyed more."}
{"text":"This is hands down, my favorite brewery in AZ.  The food never disappoints. The chicken conduit and Pretzels are spectacular appetizers. And the burgers are tremendous.  But make no mistake, this is a craft beer lover's paradise.   I've now been here on 4 separate occasions, and there are always new beers to try. But their Refuge IPA is one of the best IPAs I've ever tasted.  There is usually a wait, but they have a full service tasting room to spend your air conditioned wait taste-testing their amazing selection."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and want to love the restaurant but for me the beers are not my taste and the food was very bland tasting. Service was excellent though. I would just say that I was underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Honestly thought this was a bagel shop and a shack. We decided to swing in and to our surprise it packed full. We got the Arizona trail burger. It was great, but I chose the chips over the fries. This was a mistake. The chips were butnt. Not sure if that's how they're supposed to be but either way it wasn't my taste buds. I should of chose the fries because they were on point."}
{"text":"Great food and even better beer. The atmosphere is very casual and all the waitresses seem to be knowledgeable on the beer selection. Glad to support this AZ restaurant and the article on how this place was started is inspiring."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin. I was told by a friend that if I was looking for the best beer in Arizona, it would be here. And it was.   I got here at 11:30 am on a beautiful Sunday so the bar area was pretty much empty. I sat at the bar like I always do when traveling alone.   The bartender was super friendly, and let me have a taste of different beers before I made a decision. Which made it hard. Everything here was delicious even the sour. (I usually hate sours)  I also have to say he was super knowledgeable about every single thing not only with beer but with food too.   I had the duck fat fries. Those are a must!  The onion rings although good were a little sweet for me.   I'm going to have to visit Arizona more often now, just so I can come here."}
{"text":"The beer selection is magnificent. Especially if you like sours and saisons like me.  Admittedly I was here just for the beers. But, the lady sitting next to me raved about their food. I decided to try their chipotle chicken taco and pork taco. They were good with plenty of heat and some nice pickled onion. They were above average in my opinion. Better then most but I've had better.   Overall a great atmosphere and very nice staff behind the bar."}
{"text":"Quick and courteous service. Food was excellent! On point with quality and flavor! Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin. The food was beyond amazing. The beer selection was phenomenal. The service was over the top. They hands down are the best managers and servers in the business. Huge shout out to Chris and Mary for taking amazing care of us."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new place.  Had to sit outside, understood since it was Sat late afternoon.  It wasn't too bad outside even at 110 degrees, but sitting under the misters kinda stunk, better than waiting.  Server was a nice gal, but we didn't see her very often.  Had to go and get our own pitcher from the bar, flag someone down for food containers, etc.  Up charge ($2) Onion rings were cold, and only got 5 of them, however they made it up to us and brought more.  Food was pretty good, not great. Enjoyed the blood orange beer.  Overall disappointing.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"This place is certainly overrated. The french fries made in duck fat oil tasted and smelled horrible. The meat greatly lacked flavor and the hamburger bun was apparently old because of the way it crumbled. I won't eat here again despite the higher ratings it recvd."}
{"text":"I've now been here twice. As a restaurant go-er; not critic, it is never, ever, okay to get food before drinks. That was my first visit several months ago. I gave them another chance recently though because the hostesses and servers were so awesome. They still are. The food.. is mediocre. My hubby likes the beer options and we both love the ambiance but it just seems like the food is sub-par and over-priced."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the East valley.  Outstanding BEER selection that is always changing.  If you are that ignorant fool that came here looking for a bar or wine, stay away. It is already difficult to get into this outstanding craft brew house."}
{"text":"Just waited 45 minutes, 32 for a table then got seated and waited around for 13 minutes for a server to come by. Meanwhile the other tables were being tended to as we were being ignored. Needless to say I don't ever want to set foot in this place not even if they give me a free keg of beer. There's just about an hour of my life I'll never get back, RIDICULOUS!"}
{"text":"What an awesome brewery/restaurant this is. I was fortunate enough today to be here when there were many many new beers, I had five different ones including Saisons, sours and IPAs they were all wonderful some dank and really really powerful others really fruity and Sour, it was great.  However, the real wonderful moment was getting a burger that was cooked exactly the way I asked for it, blood rare. I ordered the breakfast burger /morning burger, except without red peppers and instead with jalapeños, and it was perfection. The fries were really good the egg was just unctuous and who is he and wonderful and of course dipping the fries in the egg yolk was tremendous. I also got to try some of the jalapeño jelly from one of my friends peanut butter and jalapeño jelly burgers and jalapeño jelly was really good but that's not what I had today. This is a tremendous beer establishment; The food and the fact that they deliver the food away you order it makes it just that much more wonderful. I highly recommend Arizona wilderness."}
{"text":"The wait was horrendous. The special was bad. I ordered the spare ribs was given the pulled pork full of gristle. The duck fries were excellent. After we were done it took 20 min to get the check. It was busy but not packed enough to receive sub-par service and food."}
{"text":"We did not enjoy any of the beers we tried, but that happens. What gives this place the one star rating is the crap service. We sat at the bar, and the girl was great about taking our order. We got a flight.  We then tried the beers, didn't like them, and googled our next stop. Not sure if we turned invisible at some point, but my husband finally had to almost yell at her to get us the bill so we could leave. Strangely, the younger men next to us didn't seem to have the same problem we did getting attention.  I know we're old and fat, but our money spends the same, and we've probably got more of it, so don't ignore us! We will spread the word to our people"}
{"text":"Good beer. Check. Good food. Check. I love their veggie burger, one of the best I've ever had. My friends have ordered the beer cheese with meat as well and they are amazing. The only complaint I have is that the they serve their burgers with chips instead of fries. While fries only cost an extra 99 cents I think every one likes fries better than chips when it comes to burgers. If you're feel healthy the side salad is solid, with a great homemade beer balsamic. Don't leave without the dessert nachos. The cannoli cream with loads of fruit is to die for."}
{"text":"This is my favorite brewery in the Metro Phoenix Area. These guys are madmen when it comes to brewing new and creative beers. They have quite an assortment of sours, Belgians, and IPA's. They are quite creative and have made some pretty interesting beers, Pecan Pie Porter anyone? The food I've had has been very tasty but a bit pricey! Duck fat Fries enough said!! This is a bit of a drive as it's in gilbert, but it is well worth the trip!! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Wow! Best burger i've ever had! I had the Western, my wife had the Bleu Cheese... fantastic! A couple dollars more expensive than my family is used to paying ($9-$11), but very reasonable and worth it! We went on a Thursday night around 6. Every parking spot was full, but the wait was only around 10-20 minutes. My buddy went last Sunday evening and it was a 90 minute wait. We were not disappointed and will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Went with a friend of mine after a hike. It was the perfect post-hike meal. The beer is good with plenty of options. The food is good but very limited. It is also a very popular place, which can make it difficult to get a table. All in all, I would go back."}
{"text":"Great beer with new selections popping up all the time. Service and food were top notch. We got the pulled pork fries and the portion was HUGE, topped with a delicious cheese sauce. We also got the apple brie burger which was good but could have used some sauce as a compliment. The staff is very knowledgeable about the food and beer and are more than happy to let you try any draft they have on tap before you decide."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open for a while now. It seems many others were too, with over 3000 likes on Facebook before their soft opening. Okay, number one important item for a brewery is the BEER. Day one started with three very tasty beers (American Red Ale, Estrella Pale Ale and an amazing session beer @ 3.7% ABV,) on day two, they added an excellent IPA. Yup, this place is so good I went their two days in a row. And yeah, I said an excellent session @ 3.7%. How they got this much flavor at this AVB, I've no clue. So BEERs = 4.9 stars, and this is only the first batch. Not sure what to expect when they really get to know their brew system. 4.9 was only because their were no guest taps and with the limited handles they have, they may never add (I don't know, gonna have to ask) But their beers are so good, I almost don't care.  Next for me is cleanliness, this place is spotless, granted it is new, Boom 5.0 Stars. Service, oh so many people fail here, not these guys. Plenty of staff on hand to deal with the crowds 4.8 stars. Decor, this place is ultra comfortable. I honestly thought with 3 bearded outdoorsmen opening a brewery it was going to look like the moose lodge or the Bass Pro Shop, but no... elegant pictures surround you as you enjoy your beer in comfortable seating with soft lighting showcasing the gorgeous wilderness landscape photos. The colors scheme complements every aspect of the place and is easy on the eyes. A variety of seating arrangements and selection are available for patrons to enjoy. Ambience 5 stars and bonus .5 stars.  The food does not start until their grand opening on Sept 2nd ,2013, and they already have many things staged including the menu and condiment baskets waiting to be filled. I'll update my review during the first week in Sept. CHEERS!"}
{"text":"Everytime I go to Wilderness I am pleasantly shocked with how good everything is. Their food is always great and so is there beer, but I finally tried their peanut butter and jalapeno jelly burger and it is out of this world! Its so juicy and delicious, but the flavor that burger gives is spot on with all the flavors you want hitting your palate at one time, sweet, spicy, and just amazing! A must try!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer and dinner.  I everything was ridiculously delicious. The beer, the wings, the artichoke dip and a burger.  The service was awesome and the beer was unique and tasty.  I will be back to try a flight. Very excited about AZ Wilderness Company!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and was very impressed. I had the sour beer and I have to say it was one of the best I've ever had. If you're down for a ride take the after trail burger it will not disappoint. The duck fat fries are on point as well. Very nice establishment"}
{"text":"Stunning, eclectic in-house brew.  Great food with plenty for vegetarians.  Choose-your-own flights make it easy to taste and try things.  We got a flight and could NOT decide which beer we liked best.  We tried saisons, sours and IPA's and loved them all, even the sours.  And, not usually a fan of sours, we were floored by the ones we tasted, including the watermelon.  What an interesting beer!  Easily the most exotic and interesting selection of beers I've ever seen at any brew pub.  AWB is worth the drive if you don't live near it.  It gets busy but the place is big with a variety of \"atmospheres\" and different spaces throughout making a wait worth it and interesting even if you have to stand in the tasting room to get a sip.  My favorite brewery in PHX area."}
{"text":"do yourself a favor...go here!  this place is AMAZING!  we just had a birthday party here for 30 people and the service was just ABOVE and BEYOND.  i couldn't make a reservation, but that was totally fine because when i got there at 11am for the party to start at 1130am, the staff was so accommodating and helpful.  the food was rad too.  i would recommend the poutine fries, artichoke dip and the pork belly sliders.  i hear the burgers are great too, so i'll be checking that out next time i'm here.  a BIG thank you to our server MATT - the service was truly impeccable and i'm so grateful that you made my girlfriend's party a great experience for all of us.  thank you the rest of the staff as well!"}
{"text":"Pig fat fries were amazing especially with the garlic aioli it comes with. Not much of a burger selection but the burger I ordered was delicious. Very laid back and nice place to relax with great food and drinks. Definitely recommend ordering a flight to try out their beers."}
{"text":"AZ Wilderness Brewing has a great atmosphere. I like to come here with friends and relax. The service is great and I like the atmosphere inside the restaurant. I usually will get some appetizers and a drink, but the entrees are dynamite as well. If you go you might consider going early as sometimes they get pretty busy during their peak times. Overall its a fun place and I would recommend."}
{"text":"Once again a home run!! This time I brought my daughter and dog!!!!! Where else can you get delicious food and beer and take your kids and dog??? One of my favorite places to relax, get amazing service and the BEST food!!!! This place is ALWAYS a home run!! :-)"}
{"text":"AZ Wilderness has the most delicious beers and burgers ever! Carly and Jasmine are amazing and I have never had a bad time or bad meal at this joint!!"}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend and two other friends for her birthday and we tried the green chili pork sliders pretzels with cheese dip in the pulled pork beer cheese fries. We also tried a 5 beer sampler, the coffee Stout and a few others turned out to be some of the better beers we've ever had. This place is Simply Amazing I can't stress enough how great the food is and the beer is just as wonderful. I highly recommend.   Also they have beautiful video and pictures from round Arizona my only recommendation would be that they would put titles on all of them so we know where these beautiful destinations are."}
{"text":"Awesome beers, and food.  Must try the drumsticks confirm and pulled pork green chili sliders.  Get a side of the beerbq sauce.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"First things thing first: I would give the food 4 stars, I would give the service 1 star. That is why I am giving this place a review of 2 stars...   The place is nice, very casual... kind of a hipster hang out kinda place it seemed like. It is kinda close quarters so you may begin to know the people you are sitting next to.  My wife and I went at 4:30 on a Saturday and it was still really busy if that says anything. A 45-minute wait. Luckily we called ahead and put our name down and then went there. (Its what the hostess recommended) We got seated immediately which was fantastic!  We sat down and looked at the menu online so we knew exactly what we wanted to eat. We are always quick like that.  We know what we want to eat. We get in and out. Our waiter took about 15 minutes to just bring us our water. Luckily we knew what we wanted so we ordered right then and there. The food came out very fast and was really good!  We got the After the Hike Burger.  It was everything we expected! Definitely enough food for two people. For our side, we got the french fries cooked in duck fat.  Personally, I feel they were good but nothing to rave about. It's not like you can taste the duck or anything. It seems like more of a sales pitch to me. Anyways, after got done eating it took about another 15-20 to get our check. By the time we paid... we were ready to get out of there!!!  If you have about two and half hours or more to spend on dinner then go here.  If you want to go eat some good food and carry on with your day, don't go here. We decided we will not be back."}
{"text":"Like another reviewer said,  bland! Was really hoping it lived up to the hype. Ordered what we thought were wings, as they were advertised that way on the menu. What we got was fried chicken with no flavor. And a warning to watch out for the tiny bones inside. Ok...Didn't even finish them. Thought the meatloaf sliders would be spicy since again, they were portrayed that way on the menu. Nope! Tasteless. Didn't finish them either. Chicken burger was ok but the fries were flavorless and soft. No salt or pepper on the table to help them out. Since there is only beer and a limited selection I had try finding one I liked. Would have loved an actual drink but not an option here."}
{"text":"4 words: Momma Ware's Artichoke Dip Just order it. You won't be sorry. AND all their beer is delicious!!"}
{"text":"I don't think there is anything on the menu that isn't the best Iv'e ever eaten, or that's at least what i tell myself when I go there"}
{"text":"Well, went to AZ. W and was informed there was an hour wait. What I don't understand is giving a table for 6, like us, to a couple. Not to mention we were passed by others that we were ahead of. The beer...overhyped. I can find better beer and choices in downtown Chandler. This will be the last time I visit this establishment...shout out to manager putting football game( only 2 out of 7 Tvs used for football) on..."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and really enjoy the food and the atmosphere. They have a great selection of beer and it changes with the season. They offer both indoor and outdoor seating. When the weather is nice, dining in the outdoor seating area is perfect. I usually get their peanut butter jalapeño burger. I know peanut butter and Hamburger don't usually go together but for some odd reason it works and it's my favorite thing to get here. The meals usually come with their homemade chips but for 1.50 more you can order fries of chose from their sides menu. If you want to try the different beer they have, I suggest ordering the beer flight. You can sample 5 different beers and I love that it served on a log. If you're in the area definitely come check it out. They're pretty busy during the night and weekend so if you're going with a big party then I suggest you come early so you don't have to wait long."}
{"text":"Service was sooooo slow. Our server would help the table next to us and would walk past us, this happened at least 4 times. We ordered drinks and they took at least 15 min to arrive, some guy brought them out. We asked him to get out server so we could order food and he told us she would be back around. It was another 20 minutes before she came back and asked if we wanted food. Don't even know how long it took to get our food.  I had to ask her to check on our food because it was taking so long. She brought it to the table and said \"I found it\", like our food was MIA.  Someone in our party ordered a burger, cooked medium.  It looked like it was thrown on the grill then flipped over and served to us. It was so raw that I could smell the raw meat from the burger from the person sitting next to me.   If you have more than 2 hours to sit and wait for poor service and food that takes so long and then wait forever for your bill this is the place to go. Wasn't an enjoyable experience. And we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've come to expect 5 stars every time I go to Wilderness and this visit they nailed it again. Overall, they have the best beer in the state in my opinion (and I've damn near tried them all!) Refuge IPA is an awesome staple and they always have a few unique collaborations. They specialize in Belgians/sours but do really well with all styles. Not a huge food menu but what they do, they do really well. Hawaiian Wilderness burger is my go to. Huge slice of pineapple compliments the brisket blend and sweet and spicy sauce. Of course, add duck frites as a side! The staff is friendly, knowledgable, and seem to genuinely enjoy working there. Thanks for being awesome Wilderness, Cheers!"}
{"text":"I don't like giving out three stars but I just cant justify the service here, it's consistently sluggish and forgetful.  Everything else is good though - they have a deliciously hoppy IPA and several other beers worth checking out.  I suggest sitting at the bar at all costs."}
{"text":"Food and beers are great. Service sucks!!! Bartender isn't good enough to work alone. Wanted another beer but who has an hour to wait until she's ready to notice an empty glass."}
{"text":"My family likes it here but I'm gluten-free and always disappointed they don't have a GF option like cider or wine. The patio has a nice vibe when the weather is decent. The food is good."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner. For your birthday you can order a huge beer mug for $3. This place can get packed so be aware of their parking space, it is pretty small. Overall experience, great, I enjoyed eating their burgers. So if you are a beer and burger type of person go here."}
{"text":"Wen here on a Taco Tuesday. However, they weren't having any special taco Tuesday prices. They did have tacos for sale around $2.96. I tried the pork in the chipotle chicken.  Food: There was a good amount of meat in the pulled pork taco. They did have some sort of topping on the taco. Could not remember exactly what was on it. There was some flavor, but there could have been more flavor in the pulled pork. I personally prefer the chipotle chicken taco. There was more flavor in this taco and it had some different toppings. They don't have any limes, but they do have lemons.  Environment: They have indoor and outdoor seating. There's also a Tasting Room. We sat outdoor. It was a nice in comfortable environment. Not too loud, everybody could hear everybody talking. Nice music selection. Rest room was clean.  Service: Our waitress was nice and friendly. She was pretty attentive to our needs.  Alcohol:  You can actually ask them for tasting on the different types of beer, before you choose what you want. This was super nice. I believe the alcohol came out to about 5-6$.   Location: Random location along the street next to the gas station. Not really in a plaza or anything. Easy to find. Good parking spots, because they have a parking lot.  Price: See above for random prices. They also had a good variety of burgers, ranging around the 12 or $13. And some other types of food.  Overall, good location, good parking situation, food was decent and prices were average. Service was nice. Would recommend checking this place out if you want to try a different Brewery."}
{"text":"As an amateur brewmaster, I will always have a special place in my heart for craft beer.  I had heard many good things about this place and just had not had a chance to check it out until last night.  What a pleasant surprise!  I do not remember our waiter's name, but he had a fantastic moustache and took excellent care of us.  We got the super duper flight of all seven beers they had on tap, and he took the time to explain each one.  Of the seven, I really liked five of them - but still appreciate the time and effort it takes to create the flavor combinations.  We also got the Flyin' Belgian Pig in Beer Cheese - which I'll have you know is cooked in duck fat... and just come on.  99% of the time, soggy fries are a lose-lose - but not this time.  Fresh cut fries, beer cheese (yes that's a thing, as it should be) and tender pulled pork.  Needless to say, I'll be back and absolutely love what this place stands for.  Tons of beards, love for the wilderness and passion for great beer.  I will go on a limb and say it is one of my favorite breweries and am completely stoked to go back!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I only had drinks, no food. I arrived on a Thursday at 5:30 PM and couldn't find parking. On the threat of getting towed if I parked in the hotel lot next door, I went across the street. There wasn't any empty seats at the inside bar so I sat outside in the beer garden. I asked could I share a table with 2 other gentlemen who let me. Pets are allowed in the garden. There seems to be a lot of waiters, which is good. When I asked one about the Wi-Fi password, he said they didn't have Wi-Fi. I found an \"azwb\" so either waiter was wrong or they don't have free Wi-Fi. Isn't this 2015? I had the 5 beer flight and I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"WHITE CANYON STOUT.  Oh my lawdddd. This stuff is the business! Light in color, and you would not expect the flavor that comes out of this bad boy. Coffee flavors, a light stout taste, and it didn't leave me feeling overwhelmed or full like a stout typically would. This was not the first beer I ordered and I'm upset that it wasn't. The other beers are great but this one is top notch.   As for food, Apple and Brie burger was great. The french fries are just as good as their chips and their service is fun and friendly. Scott, our server, took great care of us and was informative on the different beer options for the table.  Please, oh please, never get rid of the White Canyon Stout. If you do, I'll still be back."}
{"text":"Our server Tiffany, was great. She took care of us and deserves 4 stars.  I had the stout. It was pretty good, BUT it wasn't cold. We were sitting at the bar so I know the pour wasn't sitting and waiting to be delivered. I hate warm beer, yuk.  I ordered the pull pork sandwich. It was ok, not much flavor I had to salt it. French fries fried in duck grease was very yum.   The atmosphere was a bit dull for me. I'd say the whole place was set to target an older crowd 50-60 year olds.     I wont be going back to this bar.  But if you are in the neighborhood check it out, just don't go out of your way."}
{"text":"Pumpkin pie porter time! This is my favorite time of the year at AZ Wild. If you haven't tried it, you gotta go this month."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Kings Of Leon - Arizona)  That taste All I ever needed All I ever wanted Too full to keep eating  She serves Like the Farmhouse Saisons Checking it out With PB & J Burger  The ales Sophomoric IPA I must be feeling awkward Brewing Arizona  I go Write up for a Yelper Say that I am happy Too drunk to remember Wilderness.......   I love this place.  The craft brews here are strange, but once you taste it; it makes sense.  The also have an interesting burger that I heard much about that I had to get.  The PB & J with jalapeno burger!    For my beer I shot for the Sophomoric IPA, definitely not my cup of tea since it was a tad bit too sour for my taste.  Then again it was made with Mexican Lime which I should have known. However, next time I'm around I'm shooting for their flights; can't wait to taste them all!  Again for my entree I went for the PB & J burger.  Sounds totally awesome since I love peanut butter.  In the end, the burger was perfectly cooked and the ingredients worked.  Who'd thought a creamy peanut butter with a kick of spice went together!?  The fresh cut fries was good too, but what really surprised my group was the ketchup with siracha and mayo sauce that came with the onion rings.    In the end, AZ Wilderness Brewing Co. definitely is a new spot I would totally recommend!  It's  quite a popular spot in Mesa so prepare yourself to wait for seating, but once in; go for what sounds interesting to you! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Look the food, service and beer are five stars all the way hands down. It's the noise level that is tough to deal with sometimes. Right now is the time to get out there as outside seating is perfect this time of year.   If you love craft beer this place is absolute heaven."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is good, and I love the idea of supporting local businesses but I did not enjoy the eclectic menu. I was afraid to try anything as the menu prices were higher than I anticpated and didn't want to waste food. Our chips were burnt. Our server was not very attentive. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to eat at Arizona wilderness! After attempting to get in here for weeks on end we FINALLY got a table without having to wait 2 hours.  And the food was great, the beer was great, the service was blah.  We sat down and asked for a minute to look over the menu and 25 minutes later someone came back to take our order.  We didn't mind because we had no where to go or no place to be, but that's not very good to keep customers waiting that long.    That being said, my burger was delicious, the Brie cheese burger with bacon, and truffle fries, SO GOOD.  The hummus appetizer was really great as well.  I would go back, but I would be hesitant to go in the weekend because if we had slow service on a Thursday I can't imagine what a Friday or Saturday would look like!"}
{"text":"Award winning beers! The sours/wild ales are always fun to try. Im enjoying a Smoked Apple Gose as we speak! Their flagship beers are incredible too. I like their Refuge IPA and Lil Guy Rye. They are big on using local ingredients and their beer and food menus use a ton of local produce. Glad to see this spot always busy and expanding! Worth the trek down!"}
{"text":"Awesome place that has decent food and amazing beer.  The service was really good and the beer selection was top notch.  We sat outside and it worked because they have plenty of shade and misters.  I recommend the PB&J burger with grass fed beef.  They also have their own version of drumette wings that were really solid.  There was a can release that was fantastic however you do pay a high price for such top notch craft beer.  This is a must see in the Chandler/Gilbert area for food or beer!"}
{"text":"Try the burger if you haven't.  It might just be the best one in the valley.  The beer selection varies every time you visit, so there is always something new.  Wish this place was here when I lived down this way."}
{"text":"The best local brewey in the valley. Great beer, great food. No need to say any more .  Only that I wish they had another location in the West Valley. Helluva drive for me to get there."}
{"text":"First time here and really enjoyed it! For a Tuesday night it was pretty busy - had a little bit of a wait, which wasn't a big deal at all as we lounged in some comfy chairs and had a beer. We sat at one of their high tops and had the wings, good mornin burger and the mushroom burger with the duck fat fried fries. Delicious! I was a little confused as to what was playing on one of the TVs... All scenic desktop pictures, kind of like an automated screensaver on a computer, kind of strange - maybe ESPN would've been better.   Jessica was our server and she was great! I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend and we ordered flights (served in a tray cut out of a half log, in keeping with the wilderness theme) and burgers.  I really enjoyed the Goze, but also the oatmeal coffee stout and chocolate stouts were, by the standards of chocolate and coffee stouts, outstanding.  The fact that the beers are always rotating should make it an interesting place to come back to again and again.  The staff are knowledgeable about their beer and will take time to talk with you about it.  My mushroom beer cheese burger was awesome.  The waitress didn't ask how I wanted it done but the default was to cook it slightly rare which is what I like."}
{"text":"best beer in Arizona. This place continually makes beers that are 5 star worthy. keep up the great work guys. Also, I really need you to bring back the dragon, passion fruit milkshake IPA. I still drool over the thought of it."}
{"text":"Fantastic beer and atmosphere.  I had the English style bitter beer and the green chili pork sliders.  I wish I lived closer to this place!"}
{"text":"Outstanding beer, amazing food, and parking is better than it used to be.  I try to get here whenever I can, but I also try to plan my trips strategically because I am impatient and hate to wait.  Definitely check it out whenever you have the chance."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant. They have a huge variety of healthy veggie sides if you don't want chips/fries. It's not just the regular sliced tomato or cut up iceberg. I mean real veggies! They have a side menu of different pickled veggie salads that aren't swimming in sugar or mayo. Yes!  The beer, which is amazing, is done in micro batches, meaning every time you go in there's a new brew. They also brew sour batches that are super good for healthy digestion."}
{"text":"With this place being so close to my house, I'm sad I didn't discover it sooner! I absolutely love that you can do flights of beer here, and the food is amazing! We had the pretzels and cheese, as well as the pulled pork covered fries!! So YUM!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Best craft beer I've had in the east valley, and the food is awesome. Burgers are really good, and unique.   Get the PB&J burger. You will not regret it! (I'm getting cravings for it now as I write this)"}
{"text":"It's Tuesday so it's time for tacos at lunch - this joint has a special taco each week and they are always on point. The beers are creative and they never disappoint. The staff is always friendly (ok, I come here twice a week so they all know me but I am sure they'll treat you just as well)."}
{"text":"A couple locals brought my girlfriend and I here last night and it was definitely one of the bright spots to our trip.   The food: all around everyone enjoyed their meal. The stand out was their black bean vegetarian burger, fried black bean patty with some roasted sweet peppers wedged between a warm bun. Nice. We also enjoyed the deconstructed drumsticks and the I was a big fan of my own sandwoch, the kater, a chicken sandwich with avocado and arugula.   The beer: of the beers available on tap we had 5 to complete our sampler trey.  Our favorites were, all of them. The Bier de Garde was a big treat as was the milk stout on nitro. Those were the two that won on the night.  A fun friendly atmosphere and good service, mix that with drinks and good food and you come out a winner"}
{"text":"My husband's friend recommended this spot for us. We arrived on a Friday night & the place was packed. Luckily, we did not have to wait for a table for 3. We sat inside but I immediately regretted it because it was so loud I could barely hear myself think.  The best thing on the menu we had was the chicken appetizer. The worst thing was the chips that are included with the pulled pork sandwich. There was a dog on the patio which is always nice to see.   Since it was our first time we don't have any other visits to compare it to."}
{"text":"Went for a lunch today (a Saturday) just before noon - there were a few guests on both the patio and inside. It take a moment to find the hostess station (north side of the patio), but we were seated immediately. Our server came over right away, very friendly (I'm sheepish I've forgotten his name) and asked if we'd like waters while we looked over the menu. He came back with the waters and asked if he could answer any questions. I hadn't been here before, so I asked if I could sample the Refuge IPA and he asked my lunch partner if he'd like a sample of a beer as well (the Sophomoric, I think it was). Good sized samples and we ordered full size of what we sampled. He asked how we wanted our burgers cooked, asked if we wanted to upgrade our sides and went into detail when we had questions. Our beers were brought immediately and the food arrived not too long after. Very good food - the fries are amazing, the mushroom beer cheese burger was excellent, although I wonder if the Refuge I was drinking might have overpowered the burger a little. My lunchmate had the western burger and he thought it was great - I'm not a western burger fan and I had to agree. I'll definitely be back but not right away - those duck fat fries are too dangerous. :)"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar to make a to go order. Was ignored for 5 minutes as two bartenders stood behind the bar chatting with the locals. When I could finally place my order I asked for a beer suggestion and was only given one recommendation to try. My order took over 30 minutes and I was never asked if I would like another beer. I just sat there with an empty glass and no order. When they finally brought me the order it was just the box of food. No bag, silverware or even a napkin. I asked for a bag and the girl acted like it was an inconvenience. I was so disappointed as I was excited to try this place. The food is ok but it's not worth the bad service. I would not recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a last minute quick snack / beer before Costco.  We had the red pepper hummus and pretzel sticks.  Both were delicious, our favorite was the hummus with cucumbers."}
{"text":"My husband and I had visited this brewery when it had first opened. I was not impressed but my husband did enjoy their local beer. We decided to give this place another try and boy was I glad we did! They revamped the menu and added what felt like a million more options!  We went on a wednesday and I cannot even begin to explain how busy they were! It was great to see the difference. I'm not going to lie, when I saw how busy it was I was a little afraid we would get terrible service and everything would take a million years to come out.  He ordered the flight of beers and it came almost immediately. Our server came back to take our order and it was about 15 mins when the food came out.  I ordered the Ruben burger with extra thousand island beer sauce on the side. I don't know why I decided to order this, I've never ordered anything Ruben... it was the best choice!! The slaw that came on top of it was perfect and emphasized the other flavors. My only complaint is that the burger was a little dry and over cooked for my liking. I switched out the side of potato chips (for an additional $1 and change) for onion rings deep friend with waffle batter. YUM YUM YUM! A hint of sweet, and not soggy or oily like most onion rings are.  The service was great, every time my husband finished one of the flight beers, someone came up and picked up the glass almost as soon as he put it down. This place was packed! We can't wait to go back... I want to try something new, but I'm not going to lie, I'm prob gonna order the Ruben burger again, only cooked a little less. GO TRY THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"As good as it gets for food and beer!  We love the Refuge and the DC Mountain IPA.  My husband and I visit for lunch monthly (maybe more) and have never been disappointed by the food or the service. Must orders: PB&J Burger! Waffle batter onion rings, pulled pork sliders... Although everything on the menu is stellar.  Also, if they good the cook wrong on the burger or anything is not the way you want it they make it RIGHT - which is rare at most places today."}
{"text":"Great beer. Being from Oregon we see a lot of ipa ... and seeing the tap list having other beers was great. They have a decent selection of beer that's all  tasty.  However are waitresses was rude ... and when we asked for a different one she came back and challenged us and made us feel uncomfortable along with the rudeness won't be back for that reason ...."}
{"text":"Not worth the wait! All hype, no reason to return.   We had a party of 3, waited 56 min for a table. Small place with indoor seating and a small outdoor patio. It's dark and loud inside, but that was okay.   Service was super but everything else wasn't.   Drinks: they only have beer (seriously nothing alcoholic except beer) and its only their 8 beers. We got 2 samplers to taste them all. Two were delicious the rest were \"wtf is this\"! Sampling is fun but I think hey can do much better on taste.   Food: fries soaked overnight in a solution....aka fries are coated in duck fat and then fried. Not worth the calories and taste like Wendy's fries. Burger was okay. Wings are lollipop style, also okay. Artichoke dip tasted like sour cream, in a very bad way.   The bathrooms were clean and big.   Glad we tried this place out so we can say we have been, and that we won't return. Stick with Santan, ohso, four peaks over this place."}
{"text":"The food is decent, the beer selection could be a lot better, and the service is adequate. I find it very strange how a business that is wilderness oriented serves everything on paper plates with plastic utensils. Not only is it difficult to cut your food with a plastic knife, it is just plain wasteful."}
{"text":"I love craft beers and they are on point with their beers. The two beers that I enjoyed the most was their nitro stout and Suite and Tie IPA. Usually I'll try and venture out of my bubble and try something new but always find myself going back to those. I haven't had a chance to enjoy their food but I will eventually. I'll keep going back and enjoying their craft."}
{"text":"A little loud but on the flip side- a great and alive vibe going on. The beer is SO fresh and everyone working there is very happy and so helpful even when it is SUPER busy. Anyone I ordered from was willing to describe each beer in layman's terms if you don't know what a certain style means, which I found really helpful even thinking I knew a thing or 2 about beer ;-)  The majority of the food we had was absolutely YUMMY!!!  We like to order apps so.... here is what we ordered: The wings have dry rub options which I recommend to avoid sogginess and then get a hot sauce in addition to dip into if you like wet sauce. They literally fall off the bone as they are lollipop style, so tasty & tender! The pretzels are super hot, soft and a great compliment to the beer with the beer cheese and mustard seed dipping sauces.  The pork and gravy covered fries were very much lacking, they aren't crispy and they were cold, the flavor was a bit off as well.  I will DEFINITELY be back- p.s. I didn't have one but their burgers look ridiculous."}
{"text":"Another outstanding experience at this cool little brewery/restaurant! Our party of 6 rolled in on Saturday afternoon at around 3:30 and the place was already pretty busy. We were seated immediately and we're lucky enough to have Hailey as our server. We all ordered beer flights and also ordered three appetizers; onion rings (fabulous), chicken drumsticks, and artichoke dip. All we're fabulous. By far the best part of our experience was the service. Hailey is a true gem and we all agreed if we had a business, no matter what it was, we'd want her on our staff. She is smart, witty, engaging, and just a really great person. And just a side note, were a bunch of old retired folks who never anticipated such a great experience. Can't wait to return to AWB!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Was excellent!  Spinach dip is great, hamburgers were great and fries were great. The prices are a little high and the menu doesn't have a huge bunch of selections but what they do have is excellent. Can get a little loud inside if you go during busy times. Over all food was excellent and we would return."}
{"text":"Good brews and fun environment. I wish they had more vegan options as far as food goes. I will only go here when I don't intend on eating for that reason."}
{"text":"Restaurant is a sauna and hostess at front door is VERY rude. She has a crappy attitude."}
{"text":"Matt, Leah and their crew are awesome! Great beer, great food. We'll be back!  We enjoyed the many varied beers (the beer flights are a great value).   My wife and I shared the signature burger. Our server, Lindsey, did a great job of dealing with my wife's food allergies.   Our daughters and husbands loved their meals and beers as well.   Matt gave us a tour of the brewery and aging room...this is a man who is obviously proud of what they are doing!"}
{"text":"This native-AZn now Portlander gives Arizona Wilderness Brewing Co a thumbs up! It reminds me of some of the Portland breweries but back in my hometown. The beer selection was great, I was able to find something for my dad who normally kicks back bad beer, and something special for me, the beer connoisseur. The sour wheat with grapefruit was impressive and the IPA was a citrus hop bomb. These guys know what they're doing. The food was also very good, I am happy to see so many vegetarian options! I went with the veggie burger, which came on a delicious pretzel bun and amazing house-made beer thousand island sauce. The burger came with a side of house-made chips, so thinly sliced you could see through them, seasoned with sea salt and rosemary; divine. Service was friendly and prompt, prices were great, decor was fun, you dont even feel like you're in a shopping center. Will come again next time I'm visiting home."}
{"text":"It's difficult to find a brewery that has a diverse selection of styles done right, but what impressed me most was the creativity and care they showcase. The Head of Helios for instance, I have never tasted a wild ale brewed with brett yeast that is so nuanced and drinkable."}
{"text":"Great time trying out this new brew place. It was great food, great beer! The few downers were, hard to understand the layout as they have a place to only drink - tasting room and a place to drink and order food. On the restaurant side, some seating is first come first serve and others you had to see the hostess - so many things going on it was hard for us to understand what we were and were not aloud to sit, drink or eat. Service staff was super friendly, but super slow!!! I felt like maybe staff called out as our server took forever to come back each time for a drink order, then food, then I sat with an empty glass waiting. I'll go back, just maybe not on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Pretty solid place. Staff was friendly and easy to work with. Food service was fast for a very busy place. Food tasted fresh. I tried the Arizona trials burger and the 'Mercia fries. Burger was cooked perfectly and the flavor was on point. Fries were good. They could have used a little more coverage on the toppings. Overall, it was a great place. We will be back for sure to try out some of the other items."}
{"text":"We loved this place. Great food, great beers and staff is always pleasant. Today we had an unusual experience. We met up with friends and were sitting outside on the patio and it was a bit windy. Well as we were eating and enjoying our food and beer the umbrella we were sitting under fell off its stand and hit our friend and me in the head. Staff came out and took away the umbrella then after a while, asked if we were okay that was it, didn't talk to a manager, weren't comp'd anything, the staff just started putting the all the other umbrellas down. Luckily my friend nor I were injured, but having worked in a few customer service positions I would think a manager would want to know of the situation and make sure we were okay. Was a little disappointed with how it was dealt with. Sadly will be a while before going back."}
{"text":"So good! Great beer selection, excellent food. Visited on a Saturday night waited for about 30 minutes for a table. Our server Matt was super friendly and helpful. Had the duck fat fries with pulled pork and beer cheese, it was delicious. Hubby got the PB and jalapeño jelly burger, I got the southwest chicken sandwich. Both were great! The Viking Tea was amazing. If you like beer and food you need to try this place!"}
{"text":"Great beer! Great food! Music is loud but loved it. The ambiance is great! Dog friendly patio and misters all around. Great date night or a place to meet friends. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My partner and I have dined at Arizona Wilderness Brewing Company a couple of times in the last year.   First to clarify, we are not really drinkers, so our interest was really more in their food selections than their beer.  Our interest was piqued after seeing a great TV piece on this place on the local show, Check Please! Arizona.   First thoughts on AWBC, the place is obviously popular, but the parking lot is the size of a postage stamp!! It is difficult to get a parking space for the capacity of this restaurant.  For both visits we had to wait a long time to be seated for food, 30 and 45 minutes.  I think AWBC has a very weird set up... it has predominately exterior/outside tables and high top seating, their bar area and indoor seating arrangement is only about 1/3 what the outside seating is, so chances are you will be sitting outside.  Now that may not be an issue November-March, but any other time that may just be an issue with the AZ heat....the first time there we were seated outside at a pub top in the direct sun and the misters were not on even though it was very hot... for our second visit we were seated at a wet table--yes, a wet table... wet from the misters.... we reluctantly sat down because that was all they said they had available after a long wait, so we had to sit at a wet table...not a little damp but frigging wet...we almost got up and left, but in the nick of time they turned off the misters and the table dried fairly quickly because of the heat thankfully.  NOTE to management: Don't seat people at obviously wet tables, it's just gross and weird.   I felt the music playing was a huge distraction, it was very loud and it is some type of Alt Metal-ish type music...very hard to hear your dinner companion over music and brimming full restaurant.  Now for the food - my partner adores their Peanut Butter and Jalapeno Jelly Burger, he reports that it is super flavorful with a strange unexpected good twist from the peanut butter and jelly part, he got that burger at both visits and highly recommends it.  I tried both their Apple and Brie Burger and the Mushroom and Beer Cheese Burger.  I feel the overall in both cases the burgers could use a bit more seasoning, both of mine were very plainly seasoned burgers with not much flavor to the meat itself.   On my mushroom and beer cheese burger, the beer cheese was just liquid pooled in the bottom of the basket, none on the burger-weird.  The burgers are very messy you so will need lots of napkins.   The highlight of our last visit was we both very much enjoyed their tasty onion rings, the ORs are battered very generously in a delicious slightly sweet waffle batter and the onions are super tender and good, not stringy, very good highly recommend.   One suggestion is they could bring a slightly larger serving of their dipping sauce as the serving was very skimpy in comparison to the number of onion rings provided, only brought us a teeny tiny plastic cup of the Sriracha ketchup, which I thought had a weird medicinal aftertaste, but my partner really liked it. The ORs were very good with ranch dressing, which we had to ask for about halfway through them when the ketchup ran out.    The chips they serve with the burgers are horrible, flavorless, overcooked, dry and burned, they do not taste good- avoid them at all costs.   Overall, I give AWBC a low B- for their food, again cannot comment on the beer, but lots of people were drinking and not necessarily ordering the food. We saw lots of apps being served.  There were a lot of people also quickly coming in and then leaving with 32 oz-ers Beer Bottles, so I assume either they didn't want to wait to get seated or they were just there to pick up the beer and go.... Either way good luck, unfortunately not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Had the peanut butter and jalepeno jam burger and it was amazing.  The picacho porter is also great.   I have had the pork belly sliders everytime we have been there and this time they were very dissapointing. Very soggy and way to thick cut on the pork.   The other negative was being told we had an hour wait, then making our way to the back for a beer. We sat there looking at vacant tables and seats for 45 minutes. If I was wait staff I would have been pissed at the front of house for losing me tips on tables that sat empty. Plus it was a real pisser seeing tables unsat while we stood there looking at them."}
{"text":"I met fellow Yelpers here for a UYE.  Not an easy drive from Glendale on a Tuesday evening. But the time spent with friends was worth it. Parking is a problem here when they are busy and it was a packed house on this Tuesday evening. I forgot what beer I had, but I remember it was good!  I had the beer-braised 'n' Blue burger with onion rings.  Definitely high end stuff for bar food.  The only negative thing I noticed is we had a party of about a dozen and the place just doesn't work that well for large parties even though we had the largest table. Given the place was a packed bar the service could have been much worse."}
{"text":"Great place to go. Good service and good food. Will go there again. Micro brewery has a lot of choices."}
{"text":"Tuesday after work, what do you do? You meet up with other for a Taco Tuesday UYE and beer At Arizona Wilderness Brewing Co, that's what you do, and so I did. In case some of yall didn't know, Arizona Wilderness Brewing was named the #1 Newest Brewery in the world in 2014. http://www.esquire.com/food-drink/drinks/a23543/arizona-wilderness-brewing-co-interview/   1st up the beer, after looking at the great list they had, I went with the Superstition Coffee Stout, an oatmeal stout with Mexican vanilla and 7 pounds of Superstition Coffee, it's like drinking a nice glass of black coffee, not for the faint of heart, if you do not like black coffee this isn't for you, but for me, this was a perfect glass of beer! So good!   They had 2 taco offerings for Taco Tuesday, both for 2 bucks and both on a flour tortilla, I went with one of each, the 1st was a Vietnamese Chicken taco it was grilled chicken topped with cucumbers, cilantro, pickled onions, bean sprouts and soy ginger vinaigrette, in theory this sounded good to me, but in reality, it was a little bit on the salty side for me, not my favorite. The 2nd was a pulled pork street taco, made with house pulled pork with onions, cilantro, cotija cheese, house made chipotle cream sauce, this was a great taco, I bet I could have eaten a dozen of these!   Now while most of the table came for Taco Tuesday, they also wanted the Belgische Frietjes, the French fries in duck fat, yes they are good, but nope that's not what I wanted to try!  I ordered the Cannoli Nacho, oh sweet lawd this stuff was amazing! Its house made sweet cream covered with candied pecans & chocolate chips with strawberries, blueberries & raspberries and sweet fried wonton chips and then covered in powdered sugar, there is plenty to share too! So dang good!  Look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"That was the most bland meal ever!  The green chili pork slider meat had no seasoning!  The local special was super bland too!  The beer cheese was again, BLAND!  Salt and pepper is needed on the tables to make the food better!  Soooo disappointed! Plus I was over charged for my food. Server was terrible....never brought the new itemized bill.  What an annoying night!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great craft beers, excellent service and atmosphere, and very good food at a price that was cheaper than I expected. I'm definitely going to add this place to my go to list."}
{"text":"Update....since writing this review we have been back 3 times. Each time we have not been disappointed. The duck fries are a must. The onion rings exceptional. The meatloaf sliders surprisingly tasty.  The beers are outstanding.  When you dine here you are helping to support Arizona farmers, ranchers and small food business owners. We will continue to dine here as often as we can."}
{"text":"Overall, AZ Wilderness Brewing is good, but their service tends to be on the slow side. Although they have a loyal following for their beer, I think it is hit or miss. When it comes to their food, I have no complaints. The burgers are great, as are the pretzel bread sticks with beer cheese."}
{"text":"Wow - we went in earlier today to try the pecan pie ale, but it was way too packed so we left. We ventured back later in the day because we wanted to try the new brews (to us, it was all going to be new). The crowd had cleared and we got to sit at the bar. Jasmine was our bartender and again wow, what great service from this outstanding bartender. Jasmine is very sweet and was helpful as we worked our way through the beers. We were also not going to do food from there today, but once we started looking at the food menu, we decided to get the artichoke dip. Okay, this is the way that this is going down: Service - 5, Beers and beer selections - 5, Food - 5, Atmosphere - 5, Quality versus cost - 5. I think that sums it up pretty well. Oh BTW, we are going back tomorrow to try more of the food - burgers and duck fries review to follow."}
{"text":"This place was quite possibly the best place I ate at while in town.  They are doing craft burgers that are well put together and damn good.  The flavor profiles are comfort with a slight twist, which works well.  They also offer some really good beer to accompany your burger.  Everything was delicious from the beer flight to the loaded fries to the burgers."}
{"text":"Always great beer on tap!  My favorite is Little Guy Rye.  Always good service and the food is delicious too.  If it is your birthday, expect a really large beer for a very small price!  It's a pretty cool place to hang out, either inside or on the patio with misters to keep you cool with the hot AZ days.  Definitely gotta try it!"}
{"text":"Food, beer and service were amazing!  There were six of us and everyone loved it.  The food tends to have some unique aspects such as the chicken wings fried in duck fat.  We got the spicier ones which weren't overly spicy and not typical but really good and meaty.  Also, the sliders were served on a pretzel role, which definitely added to the flavor.  The only downside to the whole place might be the noise level, but we enjoyed our overall experience!"}
{"text":"Great food! Kind of annoying that they upcharge you for fries so it ends up being a little pricey, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend after work for a beer and glad I did!  Very cool place with awesome staff.  Great selection of beer!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on a Friday night post Flatiron hike. About 2 miles from the freeway with lots of outside and inside seating, It is popular with locals and had a 45 to 60 minute wait for a table. We checked out the tasting room then found seats immediately at the bar. Staff great, food amazing and beers represent well. I had the bar menu tacos, partner a After Hike burger, tried two of the IPAs (both great) and my partner had what approximated an amber (learning Amber is a NW thing). We had never seem their beer categories/naming conventions but the bartender helped us navigate. Bring a lit magnifying glass - beer offering menu is in 8 point font."}
{"text":"I'm not the most adventurous eater, so I stuck to the safe bets here. But I can see how if you like a more interesting dining experience you would love AZ Wilderness. They have a wide variety of unique food/drink options. Every time we've stopped by, this place is packed and busy.   I had a build your own burger. Everything about it was done nicely, and I enjoyed the delicious bun, high quality beef, and perfectly cooked toppings. My husband had the Notorious P.I.G. (Pork patty, thick cut bacon, pork belly, beer mustard, pickles, etc.) He loved it, and yes, we can rarely share entrees since he likes the crazy stuff! The duck fat fries were good - I especially enjoyed the garlic aioli and fresh thyme and rosemary on them. The fruit and nut salad sounded really tasty, so I'll have to try that next time.   My husband loves the beer selection. He especially loves the Chocolate Bunny beer that they bring out around Easter time. AZ Wilderness uses the cacao nibs from our beloved Scottsdale chocolatier, Zak's chocolate. Sadly, they run out of that beer quickly so my husband missed out this season!  This would be a great place to hang out with friends - lots of loud music, plenty of outdoor seating, etc. I've also seen that it is popular with families as well. Come try it out!"}
{"text":"The beer is excellent and the food awesome. Had the Notorious PIG. It was delicious. Pork patty, pork belly and bacon. The bartender was friendly and helpful. All the staff was attentive. A little bit of confusion on the type of fries but no biggie."}
{"text":"Great place. Delicious food and great beers. One of the best wings I have ever had. My wife and I also enjoyed the atmosphere. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We went in for dinner and our party of 8 ended up just drinking our beer and leaving to a better place.  Outside tables were covered with ants, there was not enough light inside to see the menu, no Wi-Fi, and waitress had a bad attitude.  The beer was OK, but not good enough to go back."}
{"text":"Great food and beer! You have to get the PB burger, you won't regret it. Quick service too! I'll be back soon with others! Try the beer tasters for a good idea of what they have to offer for a growler to go!"}
{"text":"Wow, what s fun place! We were visiting friends in nearby Chandler, AZ when we were told about this place and decided to try it out. The menu has great choices and craft brews. The best part is you can order a round of five different brews and order your favorite or another five with the same or different brews! We ate outside on the patio and nearly closed the place down! Did I mention our kids were with us! The service was great and the food was great. I'll definitely return here again the next time I'm in the area. Prices are comparable and the atmosphere is lively with late 20- early 40 something crowd. Just sayin!"}
{"text":"I live a couple of miles from here and, no joke, this is one of the nicest places you can find to eat within a short drive both food and decor wise.  Just about everything I've had here from burgers to tacos has been good to very good and the absolute tastiest thing I have had are the pretzel sticks which are downright addicting.  The beer is the star of the show though. Unlike some of the more established breweries around town, they are not afraid to take risks. You can usually find 15+ of their own beers on the menu. Some are incredible, some are so-so, but you have to admire the creativity, commitment to locally sourced ingredients, and the willingness to rotate in brand new beers frequently.  Bonus points for offering flights and also for having a nice patio.  One warning: this place can get packed on the weekends especially if the weather is nice. Get there early or hit them up during the week."}
{"text":"I now know why Ratebeer.com showered this place with such an amazing award.  Their beer is amazing!  The Hellsgate Imperial Saison is so smooth that you would have no idea that it had such a high alcohol content until you saw the little snifter they pour it into.  It's all good, because I'll take quality over quantity any day.  My hubby loved their double IPA.  We took advantage of the burger and a beer for $10 special and absolutely devoured our burgers.  The food held it's own with such amazing beer by it's side.  My only question is, where can I get my very own AZ Wilderness tacker to hang on my wall at home? We collect them and I want to rep AZ Wilderness!"}
{"text":"Great food and great beer! I have seen they are very friendly to service dogs which is nice too see. This is one of the few breweries that knows what they are doing with beer. Added plus, I don't think anywhere else serves a better burger!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. When I plan to come here, it's literally the most anticipated part of my day. The beers are so Damn good and knowing the get the ingredients from Arizona as well makes it even cooler. The food is very limited with options but has always been great. Top notch craft beer"}
{"text":"The service on this Friday afternoon was not the greatest. We sat for 15 minutes before anyone came to take our order. Our poor waitress SEEMED busy and kept forgetting straws for my water and would do sample tasting drive bys. I have been here before and the food was amazing... I tried something different and surprisingly it was sub par. We came for my boyfriends birthday and they do give the birthday boy a huuuuuuge mug to drink out of-so that was so cool.   Over all...it was an average experience!"}
{"text":"This place rocks!  The selection of hand crafted beers is to die for!  I had the Wet Beaver Wit which has beets as it's flavor yummy... The saison was last weeks favorite!  ...I bought a growler this week and refilled it today!  They locally purchase which raises their inherent value in my eyes!    Pet friendly, outdoor seating, this place can be really busy!  ...but the food is worth the wait!  The fries are fried with a duck fat and some herbs!  Hamburger's rock!  The bacon... add the the roasted green chili's onto the good morning burger, you won't regret it!!    Staff is great, will give you tasters, recommendations and share in the fun!  Get over here it's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Themed like a national park this brewery is awesome. Beer menu is cleverly organized and easy to choose  from and they have amazing brews. Great selection of sours and unique blends.   Food is burgers and sides. But really delicious burgers with grass fed options and specialty sauces. Peanut butter burger is a unique but oddly delicious combo. Other options like chicken and pulled pork exist. Pickled veggies are a great choice and taste with your beer.   Atmosphere is very much like a national park with wooden benches and bustling open kitchen. The side bar service is a little slow but the dining room makes up for it a bit. Bathrooms are outdated and need some rennovations.   Overall highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is one of the best brewerys I've been to in awhile, the food was on point and the beers were phenomenal.  Steven, our bartender, made great reccomendations for beers as well as a suggestion for our next spot as we were doing a tour of Arizona breweries.  Definitely a 5 star place and I look forward to seeing their beers hit the east coast if/or when that happens."}
{"text":"Call me a one issue narrow minded person, but for me a functional and clean bathroom counts.  I see no reason why a bathroom in a restaurant cannot be as clean as home.  The bathroom at this joint is a disgrace and the owners should be ashamed"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best and most unique burgers I've had... peanut butter and jalapeño jelly burger! I would recommend everyone try it."}
{"text":"Great beer and great food! This establishment is quite aways from our home but if in the area, I would make a point to stop here again. The service was exceptional. I ordered something I would not particularly order (a PB&J Burger) and was pleased. The beer was lovely too. As a supporter of local businesses, this is one I will continue to rave about."}
{"text":"I don't eat red meat or pork so sometimes it's difficult to find things I can eat that don't taste like the same meal I've been eating for 3 years.  Their Chicken burger is AMAZING.  They mix rosemary and other goodness in with ground chicken and put it on a homemade bun.  You should also check out their Rosemary fries that are deep fried in duck fat.  It tastes like happiness.  The beer is pretty bomb too.  Also, our waiter was so sweet.  My roomie had a headache and he tracked down some tylenol for her!"}
{"text":"Just dropped in for a beer and went in the tasting room. Nice relaxed vibe and had a great Superstition Coffee Stout. I wish I could have stayed longer and tried the food...next time."}
{"text":"Great beer selection.  Give yourself and opportunity to try something new.  You will not be disappointed. The hamburgers are great and the staff is friendly.  It can get a little crowded as you would expect."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here with our puppy occasionally, and we love it every time. We are vegetarian so we are limited in what we can eat, but Bryce and Megan take excellent care of us. They both know the menu inside and out. Not only this, but they are so much fun to talk to!!   I recommend this place to all of my friends for the great quality service and food (my boyfriend says the beer is great!). The patio is set up in such a way that allows you to enjoy the beautiful Arizona weather without being scorched by the sun. And I can bring my dogs? Done deal!"}
{"text":"The reason I am giving it four stars and not five because it is too warm inside. I had to fan myself constantly.  The food was great, the workers were awesome but I will go back when it's winter so I don't have to worry about sweating."}
{"text":"This place is great! Staff is friendly with everyone and work to help make the experience even better. Must go when in AZ!"}
{"text":"The wife and I have really enjoyed our first few trips here. We are looking forward to our next visit.   So far we can whole-heartedly recommend the Chicken Wings Confit (don't order them extra crispy, they are fine the way they are), the Green chili pulled pork sliders, and the Arizona trail burger. We also had a couple sample flights of beer. We really like the Barely Wine.  A happy experience awaits you."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and atmosphere! The staff loves kids! I recommend the chicken burger on pretzel bun and the beer-b-que wings!"}
{"text":"This is the easiest review I've ever had to give.  Their American Presidential Stout is superb.  Burgers and fries are definitely not your typical bar food quality either.  Exceptionally flavorful.  Waitress was friendly and provided good service.  Give this place a try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"By far the best artichoke dip I've ever had. I'd even have to say the tortilla chips are some of the best I've ever had because they are paper thin.   Besides their food, the beer here is some of the best you will find in Arizona. They have a lot of great unique creations that you won't find anywhere else.   The bar staff is also exceptional, they all have a great personality and are outgoing. They all know their product and a quite a bit about the beer industry. Arizona Wilderness is the best brewery around; bar none!:"}
{"text":"It's always difficult to say 'as good as it gets'...that takes some of the fun out of the quest.   But AZ Wilderness is a benchmark.   We stopped for lunch which was excellent.   Beers were exceptional.    I could have easily spent many hours there sampling and enjoying.   There are only a small handful of other brewpubs/breweries that are in this league."}
{"text":"First of all, fantastic beer. Over the course of 3 hours I sipped on three: Chocolate Bunny Imperial Milk Porter, brewed with cacao nibs and Madagascar vanilla beans (as delicious as it sounds); Barrel Aged Tres Alamos Tripel, aged in Chardonnay barrels that truly imparted a wine-like quality; and the sessionable Woolsey Wit, brewed with temperamental Brettanomyces yeast and flavored with coriander & local oranges. All three would stand up to repeat drinking, although the Wit at 3.1% ABV might be the safer bet considering the Porter was 8.3% ABV and the Tripel was 8.4%.   Secondly (but just barely), the food was great. I had the Arizona Trail Burger, medium-rare, the spicy BBQ sauce and poblano chile providing a spice that continued to build as I finished it. Upgrading to the duck-fat fritjes was also a good call.  If you come on a weekend day for lunch, the earlier the better, as by 12:15pm on the Sunday I went the parking lot was full and there was a 40-minute wait. I'm guessing those people who stuck it out found it worth their while. Already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"So I've been here twice already and it's only been open for a week! Hubby and I attended the grand opening and literally couldn't stop talking about the beers and burgers all week.  It's pretty much seat yourself from what I can tell. But they manage to notice us and get to us quickly. Customer service is super friendly and attentive.  Opening night we ordered the 70/30 brisket burger and it came with home fries. This time it came with rosemary chips. Real cut potatoes. They were excellent! Both times the burgers have been cooked perfectly. Soft and juicy and a little pink...SO good. We have no problem ditching our plant based diet for THIS burger.   So this is a brewery so it's really about the beer right? I'm not a beer expert or hardly even a beer drinker honestly, and the BWBW made me wish I had bought a growler so I could drink it every night. It's probably the best wheat beer ever. They had a few ales and IPAs that were quite good as well.  They said next week they will have their Superstition Coffee stout ready!!! Omg...I'm definitely bringing my growler for that. I love Superstition Coffee (no really read my review).  Yeah, I'll be back :) Well done!"}
{"text":"Another great night at AZW. The food is amazing. Always is. But I bet you'll come here for the beer. Their flagship Refuge is top notch and they always have a great mix of other beers on tap. Be sure to read the stories of each beer. The service is amazing. The previous time we were here, someone in our party was a difficult customer. The situation was handled with grace and empathy from the staff. On this visit they remembered us (eek!) and made sure to show us they were glad we came back (we will never bring the PITA girl again!) I was amazed they wanted to make us feel welcomed - the previous experience was handled so well by them that I felt we were the pain! Thank you Tiff for a great evening. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is worth the stop. The Beer, The Fries, The Burgers. Was all very good. We started with a beer flight which every beer we had was awesome. These guys do it right when it comes to beer. We got the Merica Fries for an appetizer, which were a twist on fries you don't get just anywhere. The cheese, the bacon, the onions and BBQ. Was the perfect combo. Followed by the Arizona Trail Burger. The burger alone would bring me back. I'll be going back to try every other burger on the menu. Did I mention the beer was amazing.   Service was great, they were quick to greet us and get us seated. Food took no time and was not and fresh. Keep it up guys! Can't wait to come back for more beer!"}
{"text":"This is the worst place ever. First of all we cant even sit down there were 8 open table and we were basically yelled at that we couldn't even sit down. Eight open tables were available but apparently are reserved for people that weren't even sitting there.  we were treated in an extremely rude manner. I have never been treated so poorly in a restaurant/ bar setting."}
{"text":"The beer was ok but the food was not good. We ordered drinks, appetizers, and entrees. Everything was super salty and just didn't taste as good as it should for the price you have to pay."}
{"text":"I could eat here everyday. Their food is so good and it never disappoints! The customer service every time we have been here has been great! Everyone is so nice and friendly. Another great part is you can bring your dog on the patio, and everyone loves dogs that works there! Great food. Great people. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not bad. The bacon and blue cheese burger was pretty good and the coffee porter was spot on. What wasn't so good was the wet beaver.... beer that is, but overall, a good place for eats and drinks!"}
{"text":"Impressed. All the beers are excellent and full of flavor, despite being lower on the abv scale. Habanero confit wings were delicious and well worth the price. Duck fat fries were irresistible and delicious and crispy even when they cooled off. Will be back"}
{"text":"Great place and atmosphere.  Local with great food (burgers).  Only thing that might be considered a bummer is when you get a favorite craft beer and the next time you go back, they don't have it anymore on tap.   The keg ran out.     But the good thing is they are not shy about getting you samplers for your next fav craft beer"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good, they have a great collection of beer!! The hibiscus beer was delicious! Sweet with a hint of tartness too. Food selection was alright, the pretzel was super good, but the burgers were alright (bun is different, more of a dinner roll type of bun). Service here is excellent! Our server was super knowledgeable and knew what he was talking about. It was super nice because it was our first time here. Environment was cool too! Overall, a good time. :)"}
{"text":"Arizona Wilderness is located right down the street from me and I've been there several times since they first opened. I feel like my experience improves a little with each visit. They've been consistently getting better (and more popular).  I stopped by with a few friends on Saturday night and we sat outside on the patio for the first time. It's always pretty crowded here, but we were lucky enough to get a great seat at a cool bar-style table near the front door. We were right next to a heat lamp and it warmed up the area pleasantly. Service was pretty average, nothing really to note.  I tried the Aravaipa Abbey dubbel and the Suit n' TiePA. Both were fantastic, particularly the dubbel. I also sampled the Granola stout and the Barely Wine barleywine. We got a growler of the Biere de Wassail to go, and that was probably my favorite of all. Delicious, highly drinkable, and the only beer that everyone in our party liked (a couple of my friends don't drink beer often).  They have some unique food items on their menu. It's not top-notch quality, but it makes up for it with creativity. I tried the Beet and Goat Cheese burger with fries. The beets were an odd addition, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. I can also recommend the Good Morning burger.  Service - 3.5 Environment - 4.5 Food - 4 Drinks - 5  Overall, 4 stars (if I could give it 4.5, I would). One of the best places for craft beer in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Wow! I now have a favorite brewery. The beer was very good but fell in love with the grapefruit gose. Didn't expect the food to be that good however we truly loved the duck fat fries topped with the pulled pork. The sliders were also yummy. Service was excellent and we got some good beer education in the tasting room. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I am really loving this place. All the beers are vegan unless other wise stated, and they have the option to make many of the items on the menu vegan. Nick  the manager was especially helpful in helping figure out what would work for me. Such as all the burgers because the bean patty is vegan!!!! I can see this becoming one of my regular places. And of course the beer.... Sooooo good."}
{"text":"When I saw 800+ reviews with 4star average rating - I told myself I got to try this place. Went with family - the first put off was the fact that they don't have any drinks except beer (just coke lemonade from fountain ). Wife doesn't like beer so all she had was a store-bought powder-based lemonade.   I got a Belgian blonde - I must admit, it was good. But that's about it and things went downhill from there.   We got the artichoke dip+chips and rubbed chicken drum sticks- both were okay but not like something that would bring me back here. Most of the high ratings/comments on this yelp are for their pulled pork which I don't eat - so I assume it might be a good place - just not one for me."}
{"text":"Great food. Awesome pulled pork/fries. Great beer and good customer service, Definitely a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Peanut butter and jelly burger, delish!! Just don't try hot ketchup, very hot!! Beer was good but the only beer we wanted they were out of! A brewery out of a beer....? Nice patio outside, good service."}
{"text":"Great casual atmosphere! Sat on the patio and it was cool outside but the heaters kept us nice and comfortable. Had the flight, which allows you to select from about 12 different beers, and I enjoyed every one of those that I tried. Shared the garlic fries and the pretzels, all of it delicious and with surprisingly savory dipping sauces. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I used to live right next door but never ate here. Last night I was looking for something to eat that might be open after 10pm so I came here. The atmosphere was friendly real chill and open. Bartender was real down to earth. The food was freakin amazing man and it came quick and hot. It wasn't crowded at all but just enough people patronizing the place to let you know you weren't making the wrong choice. My waiter was handsome and pleasant as well and very attentive. There's a band that plays as well as an area where you can just do some beer tasting. It has that farmhouse decor and sports bar feel. It's fairly new so it's clean which is always a plus."}
{"text":"I love this place - their reputation as  beer destination is well deserved.  The brewers here are so inventive and bring tastes from around the world.  The beer offerings rotate so don't always expect to find your favorite - use the opportunity to explore.   One note - the on alcohol they serve is beer so if someone in your party is a not a fan make sure they know ahead of time.  Also, it will be busy  My 5 star rating is based on the beer.  The food is good but not 5 star - more like 3-4.  The duck fat fries are really sinfully good, but everything else is only good bar food.  After a beer or two, though do you really want haute cuisine?  I didn't think so.  Go, indulge, make happy faces, go again."}
{"text":"Decided to visit this place since I have passed it so many times. Very glad I finally checked it out! My server Joseph was awesome and very attentive. On his suggestion I ordered the 5 beer flight, definitely the best way to sample the large variety of beers they have on tap. For food I had the pulled pork sandwich, very good in my opinion and everything was fairly priced.   Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Overall it was great. Was told it would be a 45 min wait which turned into 15 min a major plus. We sat out on the patio and the atmosphere was fantastic. Ordered the artichoke dip it was killer wanted to order another one but knew our food was coming out. I split the beer cheese burger, it fell kinda flat. I was expecting this glorious cheesy burger, but the burger seemed a little dry and the cheese was very lackluster.  Definitely the beers and apps are amazing. I will make it back in and give the burgers another try."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have only been here for the burgers. I've yet to try the brewery. But I got the \"After the Hike\" burger and it was perfect. Very big and very messy. If that's not your style then you can always build your own. Very good artichoke dip. I guess they make all their dips and sauces in house. I'll definitely be going back and next time I plan on having a beer or two. Or nine."}
{"text":"The green chile pork sliders are great! (Ask for the habanero honey mustard sauce too) excellent beer selection. A little heavy on heffs and sours but all were tasty! They are blowing other breweries out of the water. Try their wine barrel aged brews. Those were excellent as well."}
{"text":"My favorite solid brewery for progressive beer and creative sour options.  After kayaking this is our must stop by spot on our way home for a refreshing pint, and great food!"}
{"text":"Beer = GOOD. Food = meh  Heard a lot of good things about this place since I moved to Phoenix, especially about the food. However, sadly, it didn't live up to the hype. Given I didn't really eat too much while I was here - just a couple appetizers - I can't confidently say the food was meh. However, the beers were pretty damn good, but more on that later.   First off, this place was a very popular place. The parking lot was packed and the wait was long for the seating area (40-45 min). However, the bar is first come first serve so we just found a couple of open bar stools and sat down. I ordered the CHICKEN DRUMSTICKS CONFIT and the 'MERICA FRIES. The dry rub in the drumsticks was pretty tasty but it was super dry! You could order a dipping sauce on the side for 69 cents but why make that an option? Just include it in the order and if customers want extra, then they can order an extra, but don't charge it! (Especially if your food is on the dry side :/) The fries on the other hand were decent. Good sized portion, but kinda too sweet for my taste. Overall, I would just give it 3 stars for the food.   The beer on the other hand, is good! A coworker of mine mentioned that this brewery is the only brewery in Phoenix that is a part of the Ultimate US Brewery Tour, which took rates from RateBeer and mapped the top breweries in the US. I got the SUPERSTITION COFFEE STOUT and my friend ordered a flight of the DE KOFA, FRESH AND SQUEEZY, WATERMELON GOSE, SUIT-N-TIEPA (clever!!), and TART SUNSHINE. Out of all of those, my favorite is the superstition stout, hands down. Good aroma with a nice smooth finish. If I didn't have a full growler at home already, I definitely would have bought one that day.   Overall, I would definitely come back for the beer, but probably eat somewhere else either before or after. Or maybe I'll come back and try one of the burgers next time!"}
{"text":"Came here while searching the valley for craft beers.  Note, I live in Portland, Oregon where we have arguably one of the very best craft beer scenes in the country.  We take this seriously....  AZ Wilderness was amazing.  all their beers are really well done.  Being an IPA fan I obviously gravitated toward the Refuge IPA and was pleased.  Very well balanced, good nose to it, nice lacing and mouthfeel.  I was also impressed with the Gose and their Pale Ale.  A good regular Pale Ale is a dying art it seems.  This was spot on.  On to the food....now a lot of people can brew a solid beer.  To pair it with equally as solid food doesn't always happen.  The burgers are killer!!  Fantastically constructed with quality ingredients.  Cooked to order.  Please don't skip the duck fat fries either!!  Not the least bit greasy and a great crisp to them.  The pork sliders were super tender, great pretzel rolls that were soft and not the least bit tough like some tend to be.  Highly recommended and they don't skimp on the quantity of pork either.  Absolutely will return."}
{"text":"The food was great! The beer selection was a little different than what I was expecting. Being from the northwest, there are breweries all over that I tend to compare all new places to. This wasn't my favorite. Maybe I'm just hard to please, but I do love a good microbrew. 4 Peaks is still my AZ favorite."}
{"text":"This place has always been a favorite of mine. I yelped brewery and this is where I ended up. They have good food with flavors on point. Now for the beer...the beer is really a hit or miss for me. I enjoy a lot of beers but not sours. They tend to have a lot of sours on tap which I'm sure some enjoy but it's just not my thing. They have a great IPA and the concept of the restaurant gives you a relaxed feeling. After writing the review I think I'll swing by there again sometime soon!!!"}
{"text":"There is just so damn much to love about this place! I instantly loved their concept from my first visit. I started with a flight and wasn't disappointed by any of them. I'm more of an IPA fan so if you're the same, you've got to try their Refuge. Everything else rotates pretty quickly so every time I've been back I've had to pick a new favorite. Their Peanut Brittle Ale (only served around Christmas) is insaaaane, along with their Superstition Coffee Stout. I've never tasted more perfectly balanced beers so it's my absolute favorite brewery in Arizona just for that reason. Another reason to love them? They've taken your average bar food menu and instead locally sourced their ingredients to turn it into something so much greater than most. It's something I personally value a lot so to me this is huge, and the burgers are fantastic (I'd recommend the Trail Burger). The atmosphere itself is great and I've never been disappointed by the service. They've done a great job building a team that's super knowledgable and seems like they truly love what they do."}
{"text":"1st & last time we go there.  Started off with their beer sampler and we liked none of the 6 beers they had.  We were shocked, I've been drinking beer for 38 years all over the world and the only beer I don't care for is American Falstaff until I tried these.  The burgers were ok I had the AZ Trail Burger it reminded me of the burgers at Wendy's when they had the pretzel buns and my wife's burger was served to her raw. Very disappointed 1st time I've ever left a Bar & Grill thirsty and hungry..."}
{"text":"Wife and I lunched there last week and we'll definitely go back. They were mostly packed on a Wednesday which seemed like a good sign. Our choices are 90% local and these guys can compete with any brew pub/burger joint nationwide. Tho we didn't try a brew, many were. They brew it right there evidently and next time we'll take advantage of that as well. We split a burger, very tasty. The accompanying fries could have been crispier but they were very good. That brings us to the Frenched wings. Damn thems was good! A nice rub and a dip in the sweet and spicy sauce was finger lickin' good!! All 10 of them! I hope the management doesn't mind me outing their\"wings\" as the drumsticks they actually were. Not drummettes but actual drumsticks. The most tender drumsticks I've ever had. And my wife who never eats dark meat, besides wings, loved them too. Next time I won't be splitting my order, with anyone. Next time a home brew to wash those babies down too!"}
{"text":"Finally got to stop back here to try the food. I think Wilderness is known for their burgers because I had their grilled cheese and I was not at all impressed. The chips also seemed a little burnt to me. We also got an order of fries for the table and they were a bit greasy. I really wanted to like the food here so I was a little disappointed. My husband got the peanut butter/jelly burger and he thought that was great. I'm not a huge burger person but I guess I will give it a try the next time around! Their beer is always A+. I got to try the watermelon sour, so delicious and refreshing."}
{"text":"After my friends gushed about how amazing the food was, we met up for a group dinner to celebrate one of our girlfriends' birthday. I never saw the inside, as the place was PACKED and the first available seating was outdoors. From what I saw through the windows, it looked really nice. I also enjoyed the outdoorsy-theme on the patio, where we sat.  To be frank, our waiter was somewhat of a twat. Everything seemed to annoy him. He was annoyed to take our order. Annoyed when we re-asked for the condiments, napkins, and cutlery which he forgot to deliver with our order. Annoyed to re-fill our empty glasses. Just generally, annoyed with life. One of the girls in our party who is also a server asked him how long he had been serving for, he said 13 years, which was surprising; because, after 13 years you think someone could at least fake liking their job.  Aside from that, we just didn't enjoy our food. For some reason everything we tried taste bitter. Like, the bitter taste you get when you eat something that's burnt. We had the Bavarian Pretzel Sticks for an app. Pretzels were good, cheese was bitter, and the mustard that was supposed to come never came. Our friends, who are regulars, demanded that everyone get a burger. We abided, and were underwhelmed. My burger was cooked very well-done when I asked for medium rare. My boyfriends came rare when he requested medium. Everyone else agreed that their burger wasn't cooked properly. The chips that came on the side were, again, bitter tasting like the rest of the food. Basically one thing after another was a let-down. We never complained, because we're just not those type of people. I wasn't looking for a free meal. Plus, it was clear that the restaurant was busy, so I'm sure the cooks were completely overwhelmed keeping up with orders.  When it was time to pay, our waiter FINALLY smiled and made eye contact while speaking to us. I'm not sure if he was just stoked for us to leave, or was trying to ensure a decent tip out of the party he completely dismissed the past hour. Either way, I still think he sucks.  I tried. I really sincerely tried to love this place, but it's not my favorite. I don't HATE it, but I don't love it. My experience was just...whatever. I don't think I would ever return on my own, but if a group dinner was to take place here again, I'd give it another go."}
{"text":"Went out here for date night with the bae and this place was just amazing love the hipster vibe and beers they had on tap. The food was great also we had the meat loaf sliders and fries that were fried in duck fat and rosemary sprinkled on them shit was to die for lol. The bartender Chris was also really good always came and checked on us when need. Just and all around great time the bae and I will defiantly be back again"}
{"text":"Well... Had high hopes for this place, but it bombed big time. Tried the flight of beers; I'm a stout/porter kinda guy, of which they had neither.  The Gratzer, Wabayuma and one other wasn't too bad.  More beer variety would have been nice. The food... Hmmm...  Tried the 'Merica Fries and didn't taste America at all.  This would be my rendition of 'Merica fries:  red potato fries, crumpled bleu cheese, and a garlic ranch aioli with bacon crumbles. NOW THATS 'MERICA!!! The PB& jalapeño jelly burger... Little to no PB, burger not asked or cooked to order... And it was a bit dry. Attempted to compare it to Rehab Burger, but it didn't even come close!! The apple and pickled beet salad... Ehhh, naaaa... And I'll leave it at that.  For a Saturday the place was busy... But the food needs a little work. The beer... Well, it works well for a poor college student on limited income.   Cheers!!!"}
{"text":"I'm forced to give one star when I'd much rather leave none at all. After being told of a 20-30 minute wait,  we were there for 40 minutes. We had to wait in the smelly waiting room (tasting room). Once we went in not one person greeted us or even offered a drink menu. The only people there were a bunch of blowhards who were only there to be seen. I can't judge whether anything was good or not, but based on the expression of the miserable lady with her \"boyfriend\", the hummus wasn't good. How original to add Siracha on top of hummus. Could it be trendier? After 40 minutes we decided to leave and highly doubt I'll ever try to go back. On our way out, I let the hostess know we were leaving and were not offered an apology as they could have cared less. Horrible customer service around a bunch of trendy hipsters."}
{"text":"awesome place, good beer great burgers!"}
{"text":"Great craft beer. The service was excellent and extremely knowledgeable. Our server, Todd listened  to the type of beer our group liked and was able to guide all of us successfully. The food was as good as the beer."}
{"text":"The bartender was kind and attentive. The wait was a bit long but they had seating areas open. High energy environment  with great food and a good amount of specialty beers. The sweet potato beer was amazing."}
{"text":"We decided to try AZ Wilderness Brewing Co to switch up our regular Saturday night. We invited another couple for dinner and drinks. The place was packed (as expected for a Saturday night) so we put our name in for a table and headed to the bar.  The bar staff was attentive and friendly, even offering samples of their beers on tap.   We were seated within 20 minutes...patio is spacious and here's plus, you can bring your pet! Food is solid and service was perfectly timed. Amazing appetizers (meatloaf sliders and artichoke dip) and Rosemary fries that will make you weak in the knees. We enjoyed several hours on this patio catching up with our friends. We will absolutely return, a favorite spot to add to our list!"}
{"text":"Great experience!  The tasting room is awesome and Linda provided great service!  Pistachio beer was great.  The best thing here is the chicken wings, bomb!  Burger was good too.  Those wings thou!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to this place. It was ok and not what people were bragging about. Could have been an off night for good service. I suppose I will give it another go sometime in the future. Fingers crossed!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time ever on a Friday or Saturday I think. It was about a 20 minute wait...as it was expected (busy night). I didn't mind waiting at all. One of the host's was very rude. You could tell she didn't get taught much manners at all. We approached her (walking into the restaurant), and she literally just starred at us, until I finally said something. She didn't greet us, or ask if we needed to be seated/added to the wait list. Ugh, not to make this review about her, but she is the reason for this 3 star review.  The food was great. Got a burger with egg, and it was quite delicious. We also got a flight of beer to try. To my knowledge, they are constantly rotating beer on and off their menu for new crafts! I think they have their own brewery in the back, which is very cool. I will probably be back, and might re-review this place!   Overall, great place for burgers as their food menu isn't HUGE. Fantastic place for craft beer lovers to try something new!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to enjoying a Refuge IPA..unfortunately we were a day early from tapping, So we ordered the flight of five 5oz. samples of their current beers..Jalapeño Meatloaf Sliders with fresh jalapeños topped with Sriracha ketchup served on Bavarian Pretzel buns are awesome!  We also had the Flyin' Belgian Pig in Beer Cheese pulled pork over a basket of hand-cut fries cooked in duck fat spiced with rosemary & thyme topped with beer cheese..We didn't get to try a burger cause we were too full from our starters!..maybe next time."}
{"text":"Good food, mostly burgers, but the pork, cheese, fries goodness was delish. Salad was huge for $6. I tried the porter and was very happy with my choice. Cute with the charm 4 peaks used to have back in the day. I will definitely be back, this is my new favorite place."}
{"text":"Well, here goes another review based solely on beer (though I assure you this isn't written by someone who knows a thing or two about beer, I just love trying new stuff). Uh, that's totally not a bad thing though! A friend and I shared the flight of 11 beers. I'm not a fan of super hoppy, bitter beers, but I would say that except for the 2 sour beers, I was happy with all the beers. I wouldn't drink a full pint of all of them but...again it's because I'm not a hoppy  beer fan, so it's not Wilderness' fault. Our server was amazing. Wish I could remember her name....but you were awesome whoever you are ;) the food looked and smelled amazing and I can't wait to update my review to include a delicious cheeseburger....hot damn they looked great!"}
{"text":"Great beer, food and service!  Our daughter said \"I love this place come and try it out!\"  We will come back every time we are down to AZ!  Friendly servers that were quick and accurate!  The chefs did a perfect job on the meals too!!    A recommended \"go to\" if you're in the Gilbert/Chandler area!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday at 11:30AM & there was not a single car in the parking lot.. so we walked up and saw another couple walking away.. odd. They open at 11am so we weren't sure what the problem was. The manager came out and said they weren't supposed to be open today on Super Bowl Sunday & had a little mix up but if we hung out for a few, everything will be up and running soon. So we had some beer and apps & the waitresses (we had like 2 or 3 in the course of the 3 hours we were there) were very attentive & helpful. The beer we had was so good, we ended up getting a growler of Tropical Storm to go. YUM! All small businesses have some operational issues at some point so no big deal, but the service was great & the food and beer is good as always :)"}
{"text":"I can't even tell you how good this place was. The staff was helpful and friendly. The food was beyond amazing. The beer. Oh my gosh the beer. SO GOOD! Just go there. That's all I can say. Just go there."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  The beers were excellent, the burgers were delicious, the atmosphere was perfect.  The duck fat fries were amazing.   It seems like the beers on tap are constantly changing, which is great.  We came on a Tuesday night and the place was mostly packed, so they must be doing something right.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Smaller brewpub with a smaller but above average quality house beer tap list. Outdoors themed   It's attached to a Bruegger's Bagels, so there's that and the parking lot is like a fast food joint. Interior is small, like maybe this used to be a fast food joint as well. Interior is themed outdoors, dark exposed wood with barrels and a beautiful lacquered wood bar. Tasting flights are served in amazing custom wood logs with nice mini snifters. Tap list is small, all house beers, with their core lineup it seems and few seasonals and specialties. Prices were normal. Staff was quirky, friendly, and clearly personable to their frequent patrons. They are open until 1am on Fri-Sat, but when I got there around 11:30 they had already stacked most of their chairs and the place was largely cleared out. Kitchen closes a bit earlier, but that was totally normal. In terms of beer offered, there wasn't too much of interest (porter, dubbel, saisons were average) plus their special chili stout and beet witbier. The beet witbier was by far the best. Granted, I didn't try their best beers the Refuge and Little Gye as I had already had those."}
{"text":"This is a great alternative to Four Peaks down on 8th st. They have a wide variety of interesting and tastey beers and good food.  They also serve grass-fed beef burgers that are BOMB. Start your journey with two orders of the Pretzels and be blown away by the beer-cheese and stone-ground mustard (it's 3 sticks per order. Not enough really for 2 people unless you're not super hungry). Then take the burger to town. I prefer the Mushroom and Beer-Cheese burger, though the Morning burger is a close second, or if you want a lighter choice the Hawaiian burger is rich and juicy.  If you're still hungry after that, the single desert they have is SO good to end a summer day in Arizona."}
{"text":"I LOVE Arizona Wilderness! Their beer selection is very unique, and there's always something interesting to try. In addition, the food is top notch! This place gets BUSY, so you have to plan your visits during off-peak hours, or plan to wait up to two hours, but it's really worth it. Be sure to take a growler home as well, because the beer changes quite often."}
{"text":"Brock was amazing. I know beer so I'm always impressed when a server can match my descriptions to one of their drafts. I told him I like oatmeal stouts and chocolate porters and he steered me in the right direction immediately. Amazing food and even better beer. I'll be back and to see him for sure."}
{"text":"The only negative I can say about Wilderness is that the parking is pretty terrible. But hey, they're worth the spot hunt any day.   Their customer service has been great at every visit and I love the rotating beer selection. The Pumpkin Pie Porter surprised the heck out of me - delicious!   They're doing some construction work on the back of the building. Rumor has it that they're adding a smaller patio which will be used for larger groups :) Perfect."}
{"text":"Update:  They booted the bagel shop next door and are expanding into that space as we speak!   One of the owners, Brett, gave us a little tour of the new space and explained that brewing would all be moved there at double the current brewing capacity.  There will be a long bar and, should you desire a few brews before moving to their original space for dinner, this is the place to do it!  Most excellent!     Recently tried another newbie for them, the Peanut Brittle Brown, which is like eating peanut brittle (which I love), except in a drink and without chunks of peanut LOL.  Dessert in your mouth right there!    If you know anything about this place, you know that they are now famous, and have won countless awards in the year and a half or so that they have been open.   This is one of those \"Gotta Try It\" spots, not just if you're in Gilbert, but if you're in the Valley of The Sun.....\"}
{"text":"This restaurant is delicious! The pork fries are enormous and so amazing! Get them! Now! The burgers and beers were fabulous as well."}
{"text":"AWESOME BEER!  I love going to Wilderness!  They have great beers: their IPAs, their stouts, their saisons... it is hard to just pick one.  They changed their menu not  long ago, but even the new menu is awesome.  They have a PB&J hamburger that is to die for (I know it sounds weird, but it is actually very yummy!), so is their Apple and Brie burger.  Don't forget their BELGISCHE FRIETJES (fried cooked in Duck fat).  They don't even need ketchup.  Yes, the place is loud, but it is a brewery after all."}
{"text":"Notorious Pig burger is WOW.  Pork belly and bacon.  Great place to sit and enjoy the day."}
{"text":"Excellent service!  I have really enjoyed their brews.  Food is pretty darn good, even for a vegetarian!  Their duck fat fries are all the rage, but they really weren't anything special to me.  Black bean burger is amazing and house made.  Hummus is quite tasty too!  I love their incorporation of local ingredients in both the food and beer.  It's top notch!"}
{"text":"The best brewery around. It's small, but they're expanding, so that will give them a lot more space to play with. Beer is the best in the game. They like to rotate, but there are some staples worth checking out. Pork on Pork is the best on the menu. Try it. Love the local flavors."}
{"text":"I often complain that breweries either have good beer or good food - never both.  Arizona Wilderness is a welcome exception to this rule.    These guys are currently the most talked about brewery in Arizona, and for good reason.  They brew a wide range of beers, and the tap list is never the same.  I tried a sampler flight, which included 5 5 oz beers, and every one of them was good.  I even enjoyed the barleywine, a style I don't often appreciate.   Even if I didn't drink beer (now that's a funny thought!), I would come here for the food.  The green chili pulled pork sliders are so good that I ate them two days in a row!  They are served on mini pretzel buns and topped with cheese.  I recommend getting them with pepper jack cheese and a side of beer-B-Q sauce.  The three sliders ($6.99) are filled with juicy pulled pork, and are more than enough for an entree.  If you want a side, the green salad ($5.99) tasted fresh and was more than enough for two.  The atmosphere here is perfect - totally relaxed.  I just wish this place was closer to home!"}
{"text":"Excellent service!  Creative menu & beer selection. Thought both were outstanding!!  Definitely recommend the Barley Wine!"}
{"text":"I feel like every time this place is talked about its about their amazing come back and how awesome it is to have such great local food and breweries. Be prepared to wait a little bit before getting a seat because this place has become pretty popular. Fortunately they've expanded so now there's a quaint tap room area where you can order a beer and relax while you wait for a table. This place has mastered IPAs which my boyfriend and i have an aquired taste for. And I seriously stress coming here with an appetite because the idea of leaving without ordering one of their burgers is next to non existent! Everything we have tried is amazing and these burgers are part of the reason we have become so picky about our beef! Super juicy and falorful paired with home made chips it's the perfect after hike/ cheat meal/ weekend treat!"}
{"text":"After hearing the hype we decided to give this place a try on a rainy afternoon. The place was packed (which meant little parking and a 40 min wait) which is fine because that tells me there's probably something good happening there. We were seated and the first thing you notice is don't bother talking to anyone in your group. It's very loud in there so you just kind of sit there pointing at things. We had a group of six and all ordered various beers. I can't anyone was blown away by the flavor. Red Rocket was ok, the sour beer was ok, the double IPA was horrible, wet barrel barley wine was alright. Basically the beers could've been brewed anywhere, nothing really impressive.   We did order food because originally we were going to stay awhile. Service was fine so I can't complain there. But after being annoyed with the noise level and the lackluster beer it was apparent we were just gonna have a round, try some apps and move on. One friend ordered just fries. They had decent flavor but were a soggy, messy pile that just didn't look to good. The artichoke dip had a weird bitterness to it, like they dropped vinegar in the batch and hoped no one would notice. The pretzel sticks were good but the \"beer cheese sauce\" served with it was some weird, watery, sour foul tasting liquid that ruined anything it came into contact with. Skip the beer cheese anything. The wings were decent enough, meaty and flavorful. And the jalapeño sliders were good. (That lead me to believe perhaps the burgers are good there?)   All in all, it was a disappointing trip. The six of us all had been looking forward to the joint then the big letdown. I don't know if we even were in there for as long as we waited. I know the place will do just fine and I'm excited to see what they have up their sleeves for new beers. Just some tweaking here and there and it will be THE place to be in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Went Wed night. Amazing. The manager took a food phone order for sit down since the kitchen was closing close to the time I would b arriving. What service. Secondly the Pecan Pie beer was killer. Amazing food and beer! Had the wings and duck fat fries. This place is a gem and the employees make sure ur satisfied."}
{"text":"This place is right up the street from me so I come here more often then I would like to admit. The burgers are hand down my favorite in the entire valley!"}
{"text":"This is a really great place to hang out and let your day's worries and stresses fade away.  Great beer, great crowd, great staff and a great vibe!"}
{"text":"The food is very rich ... I'm a picky eater so there's not much I can eat here. I love the new remodel! The place looks great, the staff is awesome and the beer speaks for itself."}
{"text":"Best flight I've had in a long time and definitely the best in Arizona so far.  Three delicious IPAs headlined by D.C. IPA.  they're all tasty!  Went off the reservation a little with the Sycamore Canyon Saison.  Not a usual saison guy but this was great.  Crisp and tasty.  We had five beers and none were a miss.  The food is fantastic.  It was taco Tuesday so we got the pork belly tacos.  Outstanding.  The waffle batter onion rings with a siracha maple ketchup was outrageous!  Great vibe and beers and food.  Overall 5 star experience.  Definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal, believe all the hype because it isn't hype at all!  I've been a few time and tend to favor lunch over dinner when I am on this side of town. Though it is totally worth the wait lunch is a lighter crowd and I've been seated almost each time with out waiting when I come for lunch.  Most recently, I brought my dad here for lunch on the Fourth of July. We both got the Beer Braised 'n' Blue burger with fries and they were both excellent. I had the Big Guy Rye which was amazing and a taste of the Santa Theresa which was also amazing. I tend to like IPAs but each time I've tried a Belgian or a sour here I've enjoyed them and this time had a hard time deciding which to take home in a growler (I settled on the Rye Guy but it was a tough choice).  But amazing beers and excellent food are not all this place has going for it. The staff here is welcoming, cheerful, and create a fun vibe. Every time I've been here every staff member passing by welcomes you without feeling phony. Leaving on the fourth with my dad we headed out the back door and were thanked or wished a great day by every single staff member we passed.  On this last visit our server was Jasmine. My dad struggles with senility and often cannot answer questions with anything more than a \"yes\", \"no\", or an \"I don't know\". At some places I've taken him the servers do not get it and seem frustrated with his hesitations. But Jasmine seemed to get it from the start and never put him in a place in the conversation where he felt frustrated or awkward. Additionally, she checked on us often and was knowledgable about the beers and menu. I would write this off to good luck on our part, but as I watched the dining room I noticed that each server was doing the same, checking on tables, and the manager also came around to all of the tables. This has been my experience each time I've visited Arizona Wilderness Brewing Co.  Great beer in a variety of styles, excellent food, and amazing staff. I'd give them six stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Excellent beer!  Stopped in for a flight and every beer we tried was delicious. Some were amazing.  Our bar tender was friendly and knowledgable. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Look, local business is a really important thing to advocate for. Especially in this area of the state where there seems to be a growing pride of our land, AZ wilderness is the perfect brewery idea. However, I was really disappointed in my experience there.  I ordered the stout but was given an IPA by the blonde bartender who was very short with us. She warned us that it was last call but then ignored us when it was time to order - she was off in the corner chatting with her friends who came to visit. She was snappy when I asked for a water and didn't show any hospitality.  When we finally got a table, the waitress came to greet us, and then disappeared for 25 minutes. We had to ask the hostess if she was coming back. We contemplated leaving, and maybe we just should have, but we decided to give them the benefit of the doubt.  The duck fries were really good, and so was the artichoke dip. The Cannoli nachos were overly lemony. The food was over all good. Some of the burgers on the menu looked amazing. But we didn't have time to try them due to the 25 minutes we waited at our table under the over active misters.  Over all, the food and beer were alright. The service was absolutely terrible. This kind of place would be so much better if they hired attentive and nice people. Probably won't return for awhile."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and plenty of outdoor seating to enjoy the great weather. The burger that I had was cooked perfectly, just don't on the inside with no char on the outside.  The beer that they brew is also very good and they had a great selection, not just IPA's like it seems a lot of other breweries are stuck on"}
{"text":"Free wifi. Great selection of beers and food. They have a separate tasting room if you want to skip the food."}
{"text":"Drove from California to enjoy the food and drinks. Great food and very  friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"We keep coming back again and again. Great burgers, awesome beer variety. Love the pretzel appetisers. And all the sauces are great except for the creamy chipotle...I substitute out for that one... Weird consistency. Overall great place!"}
{"text":"Great food, great beer! So glad I found this place on here!  Chocolate bunny (not pictured in my flight) & Oatman IPA are my favorite beers. The oatman & Get Your Filthy Hands off my Desert are very similar but Oatman has a subtle fruity taste to it. The Hawaiian burger was also amazing! A great combination of sweet & spicy!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. I guess a lot of people really think its the s**t, but we ordered 1 drink and left. ~The outdoor hostesses were too busy talking to each other to acknowledge customers waiting, so we walked ALL the way around to the other side to see a sign that said see outdoor servers.... It was 630pm? The patio is in direct blazing hot sun. Picnic tables- seats with no back- not really relaxing to enjoy dinner and a few drinks... So she took us inside and sat us at the bar... Didnt even ask. We were celebrating our anniversary and wanted to talk to each other, not the bartender. and HOLY COW was it LOUUUUUDDDD in there!!!! AND we were sat right next to the server computer... Ugh. Had 1 beer for $7 and left. Never going back. The whole thing was awkward and would never want to go through that again. The beer was not worth $7 and the menu was small and seemed over priced."}
{"text":"My wife and I organize several backpacking trips in the Superstitions every year and this is our go-to post hike destination. It's become tradition. The beers are world class and there's always plenty to choose from. Sours, IPAs, stouts, etc...  Their commitment to sourcing local ingredients is really cool. I read on Facebook recently that they are even working with a grower in the Verde Valley to source locally-grown malted barley.   If I had one big ask, it would be more vegetarian and vegan options. maybe some fries that aren't cooked in duck fat. But honestly, those are just petty gripes about a great company that embodies the spirit of localism and brews some of the best beers I've ever tasted.   Just go there."}
{"text":"First time coming here and always heard great things about this place. With my opinion this was more of a meh than anything else.  I love the fact that they adapt the menu to local produce. The burger was tasty especially when it has bacon on it. I was told (after the fact) to try the duck fried fries, but never got them. I have been told those are awesome!! Now onto the beer.  All the beers I had were decent but there wasn't one that wow'd me. Meaning I MUST take home a growler of \"X\". Now to be fair, I've been told that the winter selection is better than the summer one.   I no longer have a picture of the selection so I can't recall the names of the beers but they did have a Brett Cask beer and for someone who clearly does not like sour beers, this one wasn't too bad. But once again, nothing they had wowd me.  Because I enjoy local craft beer, I will return to try the winter selection. Food was good, service was good, ambience was good, just nothing to go holly sh#t about!! We must come back."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and I was not disappointed. It was a Monday and we had to wait 30 minutes which tells you something. The place wasn't huge but it was very busy. We ordered beers from the bar and sat on the patio while we waited. They only serve their own craft beer and it changes periodically. When we were seated we ordered the pretzel sticks which were awesome. They came with a beer cheese and mustard. We ordered burgers for our main meal. My husband got the Monday burger special which had chorizo mixed in. He said it was the best burger he's ever had. My burger was very juicy and yummy as well. They had many different gourmet burgers on the menu. They also served other items like chicken, bbq pork and salads. They have Taco Tuesday's which we will have to go back for. They also have a kids menu which was perfect since our son was with us. Our server was really great and took care of us. They also have plenty of staff that bring your food and keep you stocked with drinks and whatever you need. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place with some great brews. Everything is fried with duck fat oil and somehow that makes the food awesome. The burgers are amazing and for 2 dollars extra you can get organic local meat. The only down side to this place is they do not serve any drinks other than beer. This is normally not an issue for me but my girlfriend is gluten free and cannot have anything at all. If they at least made a cider that would be great."}
{"text":"Well, if you are really cool and have a beard and a trucker hat, come here on any afternoon, and you'll find your people.  The beer is ok.  I say OK, because they switch them out periodically, and some are hit or miss.  The burgers are amazing.  The decor is super cool, they have an Arizona hiking and outdoorsy theme.  It's pleasant, and there's no  music piped in to kill conversations.  It's really popular in the evening, so give it a try in the afternoon.  Make sure you wear skinny jeans and your wallet chain."}
{"text":"This has been a long time coming. I have been going to the AZW for over 2 years now. I still remember my first server Brock. I love this place, the servers and bartenders are amazing, Jazmine, Todd, and Chris as well as the rest of the staff. I have been to a lot of the local breweries on the east side and a few on the west but I still consider AZW the best and love their beer. They have some of the best IPAs and Sour Ales that I have ever had and crave them when I am out at other locations. They are always improving the favorites. Suit n Tie has changed over the years well as Tropical Storm but it is always been better than the last. You have to try D.C. Mountain when it is tapped it is such an amazing beer... but they are all a amazing you have to try them all!"}
{"text":"Busy local spot with great beers! Small kitchen putting out some interesting eats. Good quality from what I've had. Loved the hummus. Have never felt welcomed by the bar staff. I tend to mind my own regardless but have never had a good vibe there in that manner. Otherwise is a nice little spot to have a beer with friends."}
{"text":"Cool place, worth checking out just for the ambiance.  Food was way above average for a place like this, and the beer was good as well.  A lot of lighter beers, and the beer flights comes on a cool looking rustic piece of wood.  Award winning burgers, everything about this place makes it worth the trip."}
{"text":"How disappointing. 20 minutes of sitting at stable and not a single soul ever came by to take our  order. The only reason we were able to even try some of the beer from this place was because we walked up to the bar before the hostess found us a seat.  When we got up to leave, the hostess told us to have a nice night.. How do you not realize a table that you sat hasn't been attended to? Especially when your hostess stand is literally right next to where I'm sitting.  My final beef with this place is the clientele. Nasty hipsters and people who look like they haven't showered for weeks."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for a yelp gathering and really enjoyed the atmosphere.  Great food, staff friendly &of course the beer was great. A few downsides are parking (of its pretty bad and you can't park in the hotel parking or you will get towed) & getting your food is kinda a long wait. Only ordered two tacos and it took over 30 minutes. However, all n all all will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Again I could go into a lot of different things but to really put it out there this place is on track and I say does it right! The feel the taste and the overall relaxed atmosphere it should be a point of destination for a burger and a beer! !! Give a try tell them I sent you!"}
{"text":"Sooo. I must say I love the atmosphere and the way it's set up. The food is seriously a 5/5 the peanut butter and jalapeño jelly burger is so damn good! Like wow. For the beer drinkers, if you like IPAs this is the place for you."}
{"text":"The real deal. A premier beer destination in Arizona. Their beers can hold their own against the big names. They are making a name for themselves with their sour beers but their Belgians, IPAs, etc. aren't too shabby either. Downsides: the word is out and it gets packed during peak hours and the craft beer bubble combined with specialty brews that they make should result in significant damage to your wallet. A flight, a pint, and a 64 ounce growler was pushing $40 after tax and tip. A sour flight offered during my last visit was over $20. Primo beers but not cheap. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went to Wilderness for the first time to try out the beers and was definitely not disappointed. They have a unique selection of beers, focusing more on hoppier and blended styles. For example, they have two styles of rye beer, a \"red special\" which is a fuller bodied red ale, a saison, an \"unconventional stout\" and two types of pale ale. My personal favorite was the Petroff Pale Ale; being one of the fullest flavored pae ales I've. ever tried. The red special and saison are definitely worth trying too. The atmosphere is very laid back, possibly too laid back tho as the staff seemed just a little too chill. We didnt really try the food except the pretzels which were great but the beer cheese was too bland and didn't work well in my opinion. I would definitely go back for the beers but not quite a regular hangout for me."}
{"text":"If you've been to AZ Wilderness you probably had the same thoughts that I did.    1. This beer is great. 2. This food is fantastic. 3. This bar kind of sucks due to lack of space.  Well, they solved issue number 3 with the opening of their tasting room.  Now you can come in, get a seat, and have one of the 16 unique beers easily.  Between the restaurant, the small beer garden, and the tasting room there is typically plenty of space to accomodate your group.  For food, the burgers are excellent.  The wings are unique (watch out for the pin bone!) but very good as well.    The only downside is the location but even with that it's worth the ride.  I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Always cool to see other states breweries and what they have to offer. Enjoyed the patio seating, enjoyed the beer and enjoyed the fries. However, did not enjoy our waitress. The eye roll from her while our group was ordering really set the mood and it only got worse. Cannot say I'll be back, there are plenty of places where our patronage is welcomed with better service than that."}
{"text":"Hmmm, not on their game today.  Arrived just after 4:30p. Waited 5 minutes for wait staff. Can't remember her name.  Food arrived timely.  Been waiting for our check for about 15 min.  Haven't seen our waitress for a while. Seems she might have too much to do.  We're not a destination; our table seems to be on her way to do something else. Dont care for the music. Too much rap-like."}
{"text":"This place was great.  Service at the bar while waiting for a table was amazing!  Food and drinks can't be beat!!  Of course eating outside while the weather is still nice in the evenings made it a perfect place!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. This place has some of the best beer you could ever travel for and is so worth it. Their chefs are consistent with their food and it is always delicious! There staff is amazing and so very knowledgeable. I love them like family! I will be a Wilderness fan forever!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the flight of beers!! Great price and good beer! Food was amazing we both had burgers one chicken burger and a bacon burger both great! Very knowledgable staff and ya gotta love beards!!"}
{"text":"The hostess was rude.  They were not busy and yet when I did not have a phone number to give her she responded that she might forget to seat us.   Waited 5 min to be seated and then, with a bunch of open tables, tried to seat us in an uncovered table out side.   Said no thanks and walked out."}
{"text":"My boyfriend told me this place has really good food.  I've been here twice and both times I have been disappointed with the dishes I've ordered.  The first time I had one of their chicken sandwiches and was disappointed to find out that it was not a chicken breast, but a patty made of what I assume is chicken breast.  To their credit, it does say it is a patty on the menu and I must have overlooked this.  Either way, I was not incredibly impressed.  Their fries are yummy, but I got the green chile pork sliders the second time I went here and I found them to be a bit dry and flavorless.  The pretzel buns were kind of the star of the show in terms of the sliders, but left much to be desired overall.  They do have a nice dog friendly patio, though, which is a plus for dog lovers/owners like me."}
{"text":"Let me start with the beer. Excellent, excellent, excellent! I don't love every style of beer, but even the styles I don't like much were quite delicious at AZ Wilderness. I don't love sours or wheats, but their Gibraltar's Gose (grapefruit wheat) was ripe and fresh, and didn't linger too long with that nauseating banana-y taste. Their Refuge IPA and DC Mountain double IPA are favorites that will be requested again and again. And I have to say, the Rincon Red was phenomenal; red beers usually do nothing for me, but this one was great.   Now, on to the food, and the reason this place does not get five stars: I will start by saying that I am vegetarian and my fiancé is not. We are basing our review on my vegetarianism and the fact that he is a (non-vegetarian) chef.  First of all, to deprive your vegetarian customers of french fries is just plain cruel. Is it really better to deep fry all delicious things - french fries, onion rings, and chips - in the fat of a tortured animal? Second, the answer seems to be \"no\" from the palate of my chef-fiancé. His commentary was that the chips were no better than chips fried in vegetable oil. What is the point of making an animal suffer if you can have something just as good without that added step of killing? My suggestion? Have a vat of duck fat for all the people who think their lives are improved by animal fat next to a vat of simple vegetable oil.   Finally, I will say the artichoke dip was delicious, but not really what I wanted for dinner. I was out camping in the Arizona wilderness for five days before coming here, and salad just wouldn't cut it.  In sum, I think the Arizona Wilderness Brewing Company is 100% on track with their beer, but could rethink their menu just a bit and think of the animals."}
{"text":"Really cool spot for hanging out for drinks and bar food. There's a small outdoor patio that fills up pretty fast and a big space inside. My friend recommended it because she was allowed to bring her dog and the place is dog friendly as they offer a drinking spot and treats! This place makes their own beer and they only serve craft stuff not the commercial stuff like coors, bud whatever...my friend raved about the wings (and I love me some wangs) so we order the sweet & spicy wings, artichoke dip and pretzel sticks. The wings were pretty fantastic! They are not made like your typical wings but the meat was good and not fatty and the flavor memorable (I'm at the airport now and I can still taste em). The artichoke dip was good but totally different than your typical artichoke dip because it had green chili mixed in which gave it a nice flavor. The pretzel sticks were super yummy but I didn't care for the 2 dips they came with (honey mustard and mustard). I tried 2 different beers: one was a grapefruit type thing which was tart but surprisingly good and a hef.   ambiance, food and drinks were definitely enjoyable so I would come back if I'm in town."}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times, but this trip was not great. First of all our server was horrible, not attentive at all. First time seeing this server and he did not do very well. Second, our food order took the longest. Not sure what happened tonight, but our night was not great. We were use to the fast service and attentive wait staff. Not tonight. The taste of the food is what saved the night. Sorry, but the one star is only for the food tonight and nothing else."}
{"text":"My husband introduced me to this spot about six months ago, and we've visited three times since. I love the concept: infusing hand crafted ales and (mostly) carnivorous dishes with the diversity of plants found in the Arizona wilderness.   Here's a tip: go early, they get busy quickly.   Craft Beer Selection  Arizona Wilderness' beer selection is conveniently posted online and regularly updated. Although the selection isn't as extensive as other brewpubs, it continually rotates and always includes an interesting assortment. One of the beers I most enjoyed here is the Roosevelt Double IPA (8.2% ABV), which is said to have aromas of strawberry, cherry, pine, creamsicle, and wet evergreen forest. Although my nose and palette aren't refined enough to pick up on such subtle hints of flavor and aroma, I enjoyed this beer. The Desert Lavender Saison (6.5% ABV) was also fantastic. I love how it smells of lavender and the fact that the lavender is locally sourced.   Craft Beer Pricing  At Arizona Wilderness, our favorite way to experience their ever-changing beer selection is to order flights, which are $8 each and include 5 different \"tasters\" of your choosing.    Lunch/Dinner Selection  The Arizona Wilderness Brewery menu is basic--beef burgers, pulled pork sandwiches, chicken sandwiches, fries, and two vegan salads for the herbivores. One of the unique things about Arizona Wilderness is that many of the items on their menu are sourced grown or raised in Arizona. For example, for $2 extra, you can get an all-natural, grass-fed beef patty from family-owned Quarter Circle H Angus LLC in Taylor, Arizona.   Although Arizona Wilderness doesn't have the most extensive craft beer selection, they do seem to have more lunch/dinner menu options than, for example, the Whining Pig (a fantastic bar in Gilbert that has an incredible selection of brews but only six food/appetizer options).   Lunch/Dinner Menu Pricing  Burger pricing ranges between $8.99 and $14.99. The priciest item on the menu, The After the Hike Burger ($14.99), is worth the price and the mess. The burger is a blended brisket patty topped with pork belly, bacon, an onion ring, an egg, avocado, lettuce, onion and tomato. My husband and I also enjoy The Flyin' Belgian Pig ($9.99), a plate of fries covered with beer cheese, bacon, caramelized onions, beer-b-q-sauce, and sprinkled with fresh rosemary and thyme (a nice touch, I thought).   Atmosphere  The ambiance here is very casual and relaxed. I've heard mostly folk music when I've been there. My favorite spot is the patio which has picnic bench seating, misters in the summertime, and isn't quite as loud as the indoor area. Although the view is not exactly gorgeous (it's inside a plaza), I think the outdoor patio is a great place to sit and chat with friends and family and sip beer.   Service  In our experience, the service has been consistently friendly and attentive.  Bottom line: Nice local bar with great craft beers, good food, good service, and an outdoor patio--all at a reasonable price. It may not blow your socks off, but if you're in the area, I recommend it."}
{"text":"Great food and beer. However, we showed up with 4 on a Saturday night around 8 and there was a 30+ minute wait. We looked around and almost all the non food tables were open including several in the tasting room. Really poor execution on a new place. Also they were out of one beer in the restaurant and had it in the tasting room, they operate separately... Kind of a joke when one runs out of a beer and the other has it. Operation really needs a manager of both places. Lots of work to be done."}
{"text":"I have had it with this place... the hostesses are incredibly rude! I walked up to them and they did not acknowledge me at all! They finally inform me that the wait is an hour and fifteen minutes, and sadly that is the 'norm' for this place... I used to LOVE coming here for a beer and a burger, but it has gotten so 'hip and trendy' and their little restaurant can not handle the crowd..."}
{"text":"This place deserves a 6th star! I have no idea where to start. This may just be the best food in the world! We have tried so many local sourced items on the menu and have never been disappointed. My must trys are Wings confit, Flying Belgian Pig, After the Hike Burger. Our vegetarian friends loved the black bean burger. I am typing this while wiping drool from my chin!  The beers are the best you can get from local AZ brewers. Grab a flight or 2! If they have a sour on tap, you must try it! Bring your growler. Some of their beers are limited. The decor is awesome! Most of the staff is great!  The acoustics of the room make it a little loud, but its fun. I recommend leaving the little kids at home. While it is fine for them, they echo more than adults do. It gets annoying for people trying to enjoy themselves. Nobody wants to hear your little ones high pitched squealing while trying to enjoy some of the best beer in the world. I also recommend using the NoWait app. There can be a wait sometimes and the waiting area is outside. They do their best to keep it cool, but it is Phoenix."}
{"text":"Solid 4 star 1st visit but could easily become 5. Played golf for the 1st time in a year. I forgot how hungry that can make me and I wanted a really hearty meal.  I was playing at Kokopelli Golf a mile away so this was on my must try bookmark list on Yelp so I went for a late lunch today after 18 holes.   ***LOVE SORTING BOOKMARKS BY DISTANCE WHEN I GO AROUND TOWN***  Got a really nice 11% 'beer'.  I really like my beers strong, like wine strong, and this place has you covered. There were quite a few choices above 8% abv and that's what we beer loving folk go to these kinds of places for!  It was smooth and very balanced. No complaints. $8 I believe which is reasonable.  For food I just had to try the notorious PIG!  It was a culmination of all the best 'worst for you' foods that we all crave and deserve on occasion. It was a ground pork patty with bacon and pork belly on top... I was very pleased with the flavor and how juicy it was.  Bacon was particularly good thick and crispy.   I upgraded to the duck fat fries for an extra charge.  When in Rome ... I cook with duck fat often and love the way it easily browns everything.  Even so I still asked for my fries extra crispy. Sadly they arrived almost undercooked (see pic). I never return food so I just ate some of them and still tipped well and just wished they were more attentive to detail. The fries were seasoned (which I really don't like and wished there was mention on the menu) so they lost 1 star for the fries both in presentation (not crispy) and lack of warning that they were seasoned.    I'll be back, these people were really nice and the vibe was warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!!!!! One of the coolest breweries I've been to in AZ. These guys make great beer!!!! And to top it off the food is awesome!!! Defiantly get the pickled veggies!!"}
{"text":"For a new Brewery the beer was good but not great. If you consider 4-peaks to be a 10 I would out this place at about a 6. They are new and have plenty of time to grow.   On to the food and overall experience.   Location - Different but not bad at all. right near a gas station and a out of biz fast food.   Food- OK, it hyped to be a little better than it actually is. the wings are cut like lamb chops which gives this place a different type of flare. The duck fat fries are really nothing special.  One thing that really bugged me was the paper plates and paper napkins. That really shows a disconnect from the ownership that is serving craft beer at high prices.  Service was great and overall it was a good experience. I will be back.   Recommend getting a groupon if you go"}
{"text":"The burgers were very delicious and would recommend going there just for those.  The only downside of this restaurant was that it was so loud you couldn't really carry a conversation with the person at your own table. The building needs to add some sound dampening to help with that. I will go back but will just get the burger to go and eat it at home. Artichoke dip was less than desirable, however."}
{"text":"This was a great place, heard they were the Best New Brewery in 2013 so figured I had to check it out. Great beer selection and the food was great tasting! Loved the atmosphere and service. Picked up some beard balm. Was a great stop."}
{"text":"They have a super fancy menu but the taste is not super fancy. The staff was almost as depressing as the French fries."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service! It's very difficult for many restaurants to replicate poutine, but they pulled it off. Enjoyed burgers as well as excellent beers. Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Good food and beer. Not a big selection of IPA's, but overall a cool place to hangout with friends. The service was also great. A must try if you are in the area. The fries are delicious!"}
{"text":"I came in for the beer. A Belgian enthusiast i thoroughly enjoyed the Santa Theresa Enkel and the Aravaipa Abbey Dubel. They were AMAZInG! What i was not expecting and would never have tried was the Peanut butter and jalepeno jelly Burger... DELiSH!"}
{"text":"We stopped in last night about 6ish to grab a bite and a beer.  I've been here before but just for the beer; which I enjoy.  However, last night we walked in and sat at the counter facing the bar and we waited and we waited and we waited and we waited for someone, anyone to come up and take our order.  We sat there for 8 minutes and NO ONE approached us.  it was not busy in there at that time, in fact there were several open tables and still 5 or 6 open seats at the counter and 5-6 open seats at the bar.  One of the owners was talking to one of the servers, the bartenders were chatting with the guests at the bar (I'm sure they could see us sitting there right in front of them).  We were VERY disappointed, so we left.  We really do enjoy the beer and we hoped to make this a usual spot for us to go.  But NO SERVICE after waiting 8 minutes on a Sunday night when it's not busy??!!!  Really?  I'm not sure we will be back.  BEER = LOVE,  SERVICE = SUCKS"}
{"text":"This place has great food and amazing service!! Lots of people come for the home made beer, I don't drink so I can't help with that.  Joe was our server and was the man!!   Food came out amazing and I will for sure be back to take my friends and family. I got the Arizona trail burger and it was amazing!!!  This place has a ton of great reviews and there is a reason."}
{"text":"Came with some friends from my hiking club after a wonderful excursion to the summit of Usery Mountain, so we were definitely ready for some awesome beer. One of my friends had been talking this place up for weeks so I was really excited to visit. The beer did not disappoint! Hands down my favorite craft brewery in AZ (rivals my fav SD breweries) and it is easy to see from the quality of the beer how these guys rack up the awards.  I ordered a beer flight including a) Refuge IPA, b) Juniper Mesa Arizona Dark Ale, c) Estrella Pale Ale, d) Superstition Coffee Stout, and e) Futures Saison. It was one of those rare times where I honestly loved each beer in the flight with none clearly better than the rest because they were all phenomenal!  Not to mention, AZW's food is also on point. I ordered the Good Mornin' Burger which includes an overeasy egg. The egg really complemented the medium rare burger cooked to perfection, and the chips added a nice crisp touch that was better in my opinion than French fries would have been. I am so excited to call this place my new neighborhood brewery and cannot wait to bring my wife!"}
{"text":"Service was outstanding!! We started the meal off with the confit wings, which were delicious! Tried the oatmeal stout and peanut brittle beer both were really good. I had the mushroom and beer cheese burger and my husband had the Hawaiian wilderness both were excellent. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This place is great. Beards and Beer...I Love it. Great food and great beer. Staff is also very nice. Picked up a t-shirt for my hubby and he lives in it. They also have nice outside seating as well. If you're into beer then you need to stop by this place if you can while in AZ."}
{"text":"What great place to go hangout and grab craft beers made in house and the food was to shabby either.  This definitely would be my hangout spot if I lived in the area"}
{"text":"The food here is usually very good, but I have yet to have a beer I have enjoyed and have tried many, I guess it's not for me. It is also usually a pain to get into with crowds and waiting time. I have friends that love this spot but for me it's not worth the hassle to get in"}
{"text":"I am recommending this place for the amazing pub food.  Delicious! The peanut butter an jalapeño burger was SO scrumptious. Yep, you read that correctly.  Definitely worth it.  The beer selection is high quality and the servers really know their stuff. You will not be disappointed.  I only give it 4 stars because of the wait-time for a table. However, I have gone on a week night and had to wait just a few minutes."}
{"text":"First time visiting knocked my socks off. Was greeted by a knowledge bartender who could break each beer down to the barley.   Stouts are my favorite and I wasted no time trying out the Peioncillo Porter. Perfection! The beer was just as described.   Friendly staff with accommodating space; the atmosphere is light and friendly. The attention cleanliness to detail in the restaurant create a brew house atmosphere without the brew house smell.  I polished off the pulled pork sandwich with homemade chips. From the Midwest I know my pulled pork. I found myself drooling as I consumed the goodness within.  Their sign \"Milk is for babies. When you grow up you have to drink beer\" - Arnold Schwarzenegger - says it all. Get your brew on and eat well at the Arizona Wilderness Brewing Co. Two thumbs way up!"}
{"text":"Great place to come and try a wide variety of beers! They have expanded significantly over the past few years and continue to grow the beer and food list.  They have some really good small food plates and tacos.  This place does tend to get very busy, but worth the wait if it's really busy."}
{"text":"Cool patio with games to play so that you can just chill with a beer outside with your friends and dogs.  Loved the flights that came in tree trunks.  Food and Beer both just ok."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but I didn't really like the Woolsey beer. However my friend really liked the Blonde. And the Artichoke Dip was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and nice selection of craft brews! Jalapeño meatloaf burger is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Though highly recommended, Arizona Wilderness Brewing definitely failed to live up to our expectations.  First, they do not have a full bar - only beer. Strike one.  Second, when you order an unsweetened iced tea, they bring out a fruity herbal tea - since that's all they have. Strike two.  Third, the burgers are VERY expensive - we're talking $15 for the \"After the Hike\" burger. The burgers use some kind of ambiguous \"brisket blend\" meat. If you want local, grass-fed Arizona beef, it costs $2 more. That makes this particular burger a whopping $17! Strike three.  Lastly, the burgers are EXTREMELY bland. My $17 burger was clearly NOT seasoned properly (if at all). It took nearly 5 minutes for the waitress to come back over so we could ask for salt. After applying salt liberally, the burger was STILL extremely bland. Literally the only flavors that were even remotely detectable were the egg and the bacon. The meat was absolutely devoid of any flavor.  We paid the bill and left. Definitely will not be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to really love coming here for the beer, but the beer has sadly gone down in quality (if you're an IPA person). My favorite beer used to be their Roosevelt because it was peanut-y but this last time they brought it back, something just wasn't quite right with it and I was really disappointed. They focus mainly on saisons and they're usually pretty unique.  I'm not a huge saison fan so won't comment further.  Sadly, this is not my favorite brewery anymore- if you are looking for an amazing beer, try Wren House in Phoenix or Beer Research Institute. Wilderness does have great food here and I'd recommend really anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Went here a week ago.  The beer and food were great!  The server was really nice and helped us out since it was our first time there.  I ordered the build your own burger and added green chilies and bacon.  I had the brisket blend burger and it was cooked just right and was delicious.  They also have a spicy Sriracha ketchup that I got on the side and dipped my burger in there for some extra kick.  My lady ordered the Spicy Red Pepper Chicken burger and she LOVED it.  We're already deciding when we're going to have to go back and get some more.  If you're an IPA and/or sour fan, that's their specialty (so the server told us).  I'm not so I gave the Salt River Saison a try first with my burger deal.  The beer was really easy to drink and all around nice wheat ale.  For my 2nd drink (in the birthday mug, read below) I had the Estrella Oatmeal Pale Ale.  This one is compared to an American beer and again was real nice and easy to drink.  I plan on going back to try their Porter.  If you go on your birthday, make sure to bring your ID and ask for the birthday mug!  $3 for a litre of beer, your choice and you can get as many refills as you want.  Since I was only there for a short time, I only got one fill.  Oh, and from what I hear, there's only 1 mug, so hopefully no one else that has the same birthday as you gets it first.  When the owners/brewers were walking around talking to customers, they made sure to say Happy Birthday to me since I had the mug.  Kind of a cool idea."}
{"text":"THE FOOD IS AMAZZZZZIIINNNGGG!!!  I chose this place based on the reviews and I'm so glad we came. My husband and I were looking for good locally sourced food and craft beers...that's exactly what we got.   The burgers are creative, unusual and delicious. I had the peanut and jalapeño jelly burger with duck fat chips with a Belgian blonde beer and it was wonderful. My husband enjoyed the Apple and Brie burger, duck fat chips and a tasty beer.   We even got some beers to go because they were so good we wanted to enjoy them at home.  Service was good,atmosphere was nice and the food was great. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"So, I have been going to AWB since it first opened and things have really come along. They have some amazing beer and the food is great if you like burgers or other assorted bar food.  Here are the Pros and Cons:  Pros  - Beers rotate so you will find something new every time you go. - They really do have amazing burgers. - The decor and vibe of the place is great. - Generally food comes out fast and correct. - Bar staff very friendly.  Cons  - Beers rotate very fast sometimes. Be sure to follow them on Facebook if you have a beer you love and want to get it when they have it tapped and go as soon as you see it is tapped. There is no guarantee you will see it in a few days.  - While bar staff has been consistent, wait staff has been pretty inconsistent. Over the last year, I see very few familiar faces on the wait staff and that is a bit of a bummer.  - This place gets overwhelmingly busy from time to time. I suggest planning you trip here and going at open or after the lunch rush is over.  - Parking is awful. They recently started a free valet service, but put it in the back for some reason.   Overall, this is a great place to have a beer and a burger with a couple friends. Top notch local joint."}
{"text":"Our first visit to this place started off rough as one of the hostesses was quite rude. She did not greet us, but did ask inside or outside. I deferred to my wife and she said inside.  The rude hostess then said with a very sarcastic tone\"have we reached a decision?\"  The other hosted said \"they said inside\".   Now on to the rest of our visit. Our waiter Jay, was awesome. Very patiently explained the awesome beer selection to us and walked us through the menu. Jay was very attentive and informative. As for the most important part of our visit....  we tried the flight with three IPAs, a saison and a stout.  All beers were very good and led to us ordering a very tasty City Slicker.  As far as the food, I had the green child pork sliders and my wife had the grilled chicken salad. The homemade dressings were fresh and full of flavor.  We are glad we fought our first reaction to leave after being greeted by the rude hostess as that wound up being the only negative in our visit.   Cheers   Have returned several times since our first visit and ran into Jed once again.  He is so awesome. Great service and advice on both beer and food. This place is so creative!!  We just love it."}
{"text":"Super busy and expensive: $28 for a beer and a burger (not including tip). The burger was dry and meh.The $8 IPA was just okay. A week later, I went to the The Beer Research Institute, which is better in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place was good. The outdoor decor is far better than the inside but the misters outside were like a fog so we opted for inside. We had a quesadilla to start and it had some Asian influence. Then we all ordered burgers, mine was grass fed and it was delicious. If you are interested in supporting local this is a great place. Our burgers were delicious. Each of us ordered different beers most wher hoppy or IPAs. There's no full bar so don't expect that. Beer was good, fresh. Overall we would go back."}
{"text":"This review has nothing to do with the service or food but the general manager Justin.  We had an incident with our valet parking in that the tire on our brand new Audi was popped when they hit a curb.  The owner of the valet company handled the situation very well and the valet himself was extremely apologetic but when I called and spoke with Justin, he was very \"put out\" with the situation and was more than a little edgy with me.  The valet company did replace the tire however our dinner wasn't even comped...I feel that's the very least AZ Wilderness could have done.  Poor customer service in Justin's part for sure."}
{"text":"Burger selection is gonna be out of your comfort zone, but just go with it, theyre all absolutely amazing, no matter how weird it sounds.  They fry their food in duck fat, don't know if it's just a little bit, or 100% but it doesn't matter because you're gonna question what you've been doing with your life when you taste it. Waffle batter onoin rings sound like they'd be really dense, but it comes out alot like a beer batter. I wish they had some more unique brews though. Not just the types of beer you'd expect from any other brewery."}
{"text":"Good beer and service. Everything fried is amazing, especially  the pretzels. I recomend Slazon Noir if its in season. Living in the Michigan wilderness makes the decal very enjoyable as well."}
{"text":"These beers aren't for the feint of heart. Only drink light beer or wheats? You probably won't find anything good here. BUT if you're willing to get adventurous, or are all about beer to begin with, you will enjoy these unique beers. Each one is at it's own extreme end of the spectrum. You want hoppy? They have the hop-iest beer I've ever tasted. Bitter? Their Red Rock is right up your alley. Sour? That grapefruit beer will make you cringe--but only after the first taste. It gets better the more you drink it. If you do happen to be a wheat-beer-only kinda person and you are dragged here, I would suggest the Enkel or the IPA. The citrus in the IPA makes it rather bare able and almost delicious for an IPA-hater.  But don't freak out if you can't stand strong beer. This IS a brewery, and I'm sure their beers change frequently. Maybe you'll catch a completely new set of beer. I've only visited the once.  We didn't try any food, just got a flight of beer. There aren't any crackers or anything (which is unfortunate), so I would suggest grabbing an appetizer to cleanse your palate while doing the flight. A couple of those beers can do some damage. And keep an eye on the board. They added a beer while we were there, and our waitress did not inform us. It turned out to be a delicious barely wine that I would highly recommend not leaving before trying if they have it.  The service was great. Our waitress was very nice and prompt, always checking up on us throughout our visit, and very accommodating as more of our friends decided to show up and leave.  The small establishment itself was very busy. Maybe it's because they were just named best new brewery, or maybe it's because it's the only place to eat and grab a beer in a five block radius. Either way, expect it to be busy. But if you're a beer lover, the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"I wish I liked this place. So many good reviews but my burger was undercooked and I felt the brews were lacking. Good atmosphere and I may come back to get it another try."}
{"text":"This place is excellent.  Great beer and food.  Burgers are amazing and BACON Thursday is awesome.  Santa Teresa barrel aged with Chardonnay is crazy good.  This place has several IPAs but now a day with the hop-contest at most breweries...I like that here, there are always several delicious and different brews to try.  The sampler is an excellent way to try them all.  This is the first place I ever heard of/tried sours and I now love them. Try this place ASAP.  You won't be upset."}
{"text":"Beer, duck fat fries, burgers.  What more can I say?  The only downside are the people that insist on bringing their screaming little brats to a bar.  Come on people.  Get a babysitter."}
{"text":"I'm not a huuuuge beer fan but this place even had a few that I liked. But on top of that they had classic American/pub dishes but with super fun twists on them. I ordered the peanut butter and jalapeño jelly burger off a recommendation from the hostess and it did not disappoint. They use locally sourced food and brew in house. And the ambience is great as well. I'd definitely recommend this to a friend and I'd go again."}
{"text":"Things Meg has a weakness for:   1) Delicious, local craft beer paired with 2) Great food, and 3) Dudes rocking some serious facial hair! *swoon*  Looks like Arizona Wilderness fits the bill,  outdoorsy, relaxed atmosphere and all.   And a short five minute drive from home, this can get real dangerous, real fast.   I met longtime homegirl extraordinaire Missy F. for some quality gal time the night before Thanksgiving.   Missy RAVED about the Pecan Pie Ale, so I was hoping it was still on tap.   After a 15ish minute wait for a table, our server Matt informed us that it had officially gone to the casks for aging.   Boo :( But he was kind enough to let us sample the Peloncillo Porter, fo' free.   According to him, this was comparable with the PPA, rich on the spices. I think there was even a note of date in it.   Enjoyed it so much I promptly ran out to my car to retrieve the empty growler I always have in the trunk for moments like this.   Also, it should be noted that AW's beers are constantly on the rotation, so try not getting too attached.  Of COURSE we couldn't be throwing down beers without some food to avoid a \"White girl wasted\" fiasco.   We ordered ...   1) Flying Belgian Pig   Oh my gosh, if you're going to order anything at AW please let it be this sinfully delicious concoction. Fries cooked in DUCK FAT, melt in your mouth pulled pork all smothered up in beer cheese.    2) Green Chile Pulled Pork Sandwich  I was pleasantly surprised with this one.   I travel to New Mexico rather frequently for work, and finding that green chile outside of the Land of Enchantment just isn't the same. This sandwich didn't disappoint. Same quality pork from the Flying Belgian Pig, and some of the spiciest green chile I've had in town.   AW may very well be in tough competition (well, at least in my book!) with two of my other favorite haunts down the street in Chandler.  Whether it's for a beer flight, a bite to eat, or just to take in the sights (read: all those BEARDS), check it out.   Know I'll most certainly be back for all three, especially that last one. ;)   Well done, AW!"}
{"text":"Lindsay was the most phenomenal waitress who has ever served me. She was prompt, personable and incredibly knowledgeable about the menu. The food was good, but Lindsay was great! I will be back, simply because of her."}
{"text":"Only had a few beers at this establishment. The service was great and my daughter and friends love it."}
{"text":"I've been to Wilderness Brewing about 5 times now.  If you're only drinking the beer, it is 5 stars hands down.  If you're dining and drinking, a solid 4 stars.  They always have new beer selections, which keeps things interesting and their staples are solid.  My favorites are the SM Saison and Refuge IPA.  They actually had 4 or 5 Saison on tap last time I was there, which is rare and welcome.  The food is pretty good, but still bar food in my opinion.  They have burgers, pulled pork, a couple sandwiches, a couple salads, and 4 appetizers.  The highlight are the duck fat fries, hands down.  Whatever entree you order, be sure to try those fries!  They have ample seating inside and outside, as well as a small tasting room (no food in there).  Service is pretty good.  The beer keeps me coming back, but food-wise I have to be in the mood for a burger and fries.  That said, this is my favorite brewery in the area overall."}
{"text":"As promised, I did return to Wilderness Brewery to give it another chance to wow me into thinking why they got the award for \"best new brewery in the world\".  Well, I ended up having the sampler and tried several other beers that they did not have last time.  And yes, I was finally impressed!  I had some amazing beers on our last visit.  I did say that the IPA is amazing, really the best IPA for a local brewery here in AZ.  But what really got me was the Dos Cabezas IPA.  It was an double IPA that really reminded me of my favorite beer of all time, Russian River \"Pliny the Elder\".  Saying this is a huge compliment!!!!  This beer was fantastic.  I love double IPAs, especially ones don't taste so strong.  I wish they would have offered to get a growler of this!  We ended up taking home a growler though, the Refuge IPA.    On a side note, I sat at the bar and I accidently ordered the wrong beer for a pint after our sampler.  The bartender, wish I would have gotten her name, said no problem and gave me the one that I really wanted to say.  That was very nice.  Ok Wilderness, I have to admit that at first I wasnt too impressed with the beer...but this time I totally was.  I still wish that they would have more beers on tap, but I think becuase it is such a small brewey, they can't hold on to much beer.  This brewery is super busy on both times I have visited.  Maybe they will look to expand so they can make more beers??  Oh well, I still have to rate Wilderness towards the top of my favorite local breweries no matter what!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and beer!!  Can't go wrong with this local yet dynamic brew pub!  **Don't miss out on the pecan pie beer when available **  intimate inside with 2 patios.  Listen to your servers suggestions :)"}
{"text":"I give it a second chance , the stout is superb ....... One more time the food is delish , same great service , I defenetly be back for more"}
{"text":"Went in with a group and we all shared a bunch of menu items. Everything was excellent and the beer choices were wonderful. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Beers are all really good. Impressed with them. Recommend. We got a flight and not a single beer was \"bad\"."}
{"text":"Wow! Recently celebrated my bday, and the food here was awesome. My fiancé and I halved everything so we could taste more. The momma bird is light and delicious, great chicken patty that isn't dry. The Arizona trail burger was juicy and awesome. I've had other brisket blend burgers that are dry and boring, but this one was smokey and flavorful.  Also, since it was my birthday, I got the \"birthday stein\" which is $3 for 32oz beer. I had the saison and it was quite refreshing. We had a taste of the wet beaver pink beer which is made from local beets. It was also interesting. Their fries are fried in duck fat, and their chips melt in your mouth.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Dope joint with local brews! Shout out to Jed for having the best recommendations and for dealing with my high-maintenance-self!"}
{"text":"I came to this place in the hopes of having their 11% beer made with Jalapenos. They haven't tap the beer yet. The beer beer I had was very good. The Saison! The Goose Fat Fries are wonderfully decadent. Get them with the beer cheese and carnitas. It's so Yummy.  The Meatloaf Sliders were very nice though slightly bland even with the addition of Jalapenos in the mix and pepper jack cheese. They need some bigger flavor spices in the meatloaf to give the sliders a WOW factor. More garlic and some heat or a more savory combo of spices would work.  Wonderful staff and nice location.  I'll be back over and over again since it's 3 miles from home. I can't wait to try other items on the menu and more beer."}
{"text":"I don't leave a lot of reviews, so it has to be really bad or really good for me to comment.  That being said, this place is quickly becoming my favorite brew pub.  The selection of beers is super cool, but if you are finicky, check out what they have on tap online before you go.  The food is also fantastic.  But the reason I am reviewing is because of the outstanding service.  It seems that service is just a word anymore without meaning.  But when we visited the other day, we were lucky to have Todd as our server.  He was super knowledgeable about the product but also very personable.   Also, you are allowed to take your pets on the porch outside! I would highly recommend.this place."}
{"text":"Hubby & I just got back from date night here and both of us were so impressed we can't stop talking about who we just have to bring here. The service was great & cost fair. Really the only negative was our super tiny little table.  The food I could rave about forever. My husband got the beer flight which was a great value and way to try out a bunch of their house beers. He found several he liked saying the kofa was his favorite. The duck fat fries had so much flavor and the beer cheese sauce on the 'Merica fries was to die for. My husband got the Hawaiian burger and proclaimed it the best burger he's had in years. Apparently the sauce takes it to the next level. As for me, I'm passing on the dare. You've got to try the PBJ burger. It will change your life and have you questioning everything you think you know about PBJ."}
{"text":"I have been here on two different occasions and have yet to find a beer of theirs that I actually enjoy. I have tried at least 10 different ones with no luck. I did eat the meatloaf sliders my first visit and they were very good but I will likely not be back a third time based on my previous experiences."}
{"text":"This has consistently been one of my all time favorite places for all things beer, burgers, local, and awesome. There was a slight hiccup in tonight's food delivery... but the manager's response was beyond excellence.  Her level of commitment to the customer experience was extremely appreciated and just goes to show that while nobody is perfect... this place is pretty darn close!! Thanks Alley (sp?) for making our night!!!!!"}
{"text":"The service excellent, food even better and don't get me started on the beer. Was a little upset that the Berliner Weisse was not available but now I am just nit picking. Saison was very good and so was the Bierre de Wassail. Go right now!!!"}
{"text":"5 stars................   so difficult to find great service,  great ambiance, good food and good drinks.  I could not find anything I did not like."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait at least 45 minutes to get a table on a weekend but if you go into the tasting room and a lot of times you can get serve right away with food since there is tables people don't realize are in there. That's always a plus... the peanut butter and jalapeño jelly burger is by far one of the best things on the menu! I'm personally not crazy about the duck fat fries because I think they were very gamy but the Belgian waffle onion rings are bomb. And they always have new beers which makes every visit something new to look forward to."}
{"text":"We finally tried this place and it was well worth the visit. Beers were great and food was fairly good too. Plus the service was great.   The beers were worth the visit alone. Tried the sampler and were pleasantly surprised. The IPA and sour were our favorites.  We only tried the appetizers and kids entrees, and they were good. The duck fat fries were tasty (although we wish they had some kind of coordinating sauce to go with them), the sliders were very tasty, the artichoke chile dip was great but the chips that came with it were fairly greasy, the soft pretzels were tasty as well, but the dips weren't anything special. We also ordered the cannoli dessert dip. It was good but a little bit of a strange concept and since it was very rich, would recommend for a big group.  Our server was great. Very informative. And was great with our kids.   We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Exceptional beer!!!!! Great food. My wife and I split the sampler and had all their great beers. We also got the pretzel sticks and beer sauce... Awesome!! Also split the pulled pork on a pretzel bun with the fries cooked in duck fat! It was packed and fun. We actually offered our other two seats at our table to another couple as the wait was so long... So we got to meet some great people there too. I thought the staff was going to be a bunch of duche bag hipsters but they were great! Glad we went."}
{"text":"Thank you Cody!!! Best server ever!!!! He kept the waters flowing the whole time and made sure everyone was happy and left not hungry  The food was amazing the fries and tacos are great!!!! For an office tripe for lunch this is the place to come. Again Cody is the best!!!!!"}
{"text":"Kudos to this group bringing something authentic to Gilbert.  5 years ago, nothing existed (non chain) in Gilbert other than JOE'S concepts.  We are slowly growing up as a town and the food offerings are getting better and better.   That said, I really hope AZ Wilderness gets their kitchen and service in order.  I know they really just opened and for the most part the experience was acceptable.  The place is jammed packed which I am glad to see.  However, Its really confusing and frustrating for both the guests and hostess team.  Two points of entry and groups are coming in and waiting on both ends.  Hostess team (especially given the volume) needs to make sure both points of entry are getting checked in and in order.  I know three groups coming in from the other door were put on list before me that should not have been.  Now to the food....  We were a party of 6, table was tight....  We made due while we nursed some WET BEAVER!!!  Great brew for sure.  The kitchen was SO backed up (note, this was at 2PM) that it took about 50 minutes to get our entrees.  5 of the 6 were correct, mine was not.  My order must have went to the BACK of the line as I did not receive mine for about another 20 minutes AND my fries (that looked like they might have been great at one point) were ICE cold.  The rest of my party was wrapping up and it was already late so I didnt want to wait another 20 minutes to correct another problem.  A pro would have at minimum checked with me to make sure everything was perfect since they made me eat by myself.  Not one \"SORRY\" well make this right, etc....  Not one \"Your foods almost up\"... nothing.  Lack of training i hope.....  We will give it one more try, I really hope they get it together.  Given they have a huge crowd, I really hope they dont just \"settle\" because they are cash flowing.  I really hope they dial it in.... If they do, they will really have something special here.   The food is really high quality (although I cant speak for the fries)...."}
{"text":"This is a nice addition to local breweries in the Phoenix area (it's especially nice to have one on the far east side of town).  I came here for happy hour with a few friends who have been here a few times and really raved about it. Honestly, I don't think it's AS good as Four Peaks or O.H.S.O from a restaurant/food standpoint. It's kind of small & crowded, and I can't put my finger on why this is exactly, but there's kind of a generic/sterile feel to it compared to those breweries, but like I said, it's still a pretty solid place, and based on the two IPA's I tried I think from a pure brewery/beer standpoint it ranks right up there w/those places!   As far as the food goes, the menu isn't very extensive ( burgers, apps, and a few salads), but I liked what I tried, which included soft pretzels (w/a really yummy cheese sauce) & the artichoke/chili dip. Honestly, the dip tasted like the same cheese sauce that was served w/the pretzels w/artichoke & chili's thrown in. However, like I said, the cheese sauce was yummy and so was the dip.   The strength of this place is really is the beer, and when your brewery that's probably a good thing. I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Bad experience tonight, but we will probably give this place another chance once they are more used to being busy.   Our server was friendly. She greeted us and took our drink order. About 5 mins later she came back for our dinner order. The place was crazy busy, so I expected our food to take a really long time. I'm one of those people that's totally cool with my food taking forever if I've got a beer in my hand! Welllllll... The food took quite awhile, but it arrived before my BEER! What?! My husband and I ordered two different brews, so it's not like a keg was blown... I ended up not getting my beer, but my burger was decent."}
{"text":"We really liked the place!! The bar was great the wait was fine. Waitress was very much on the spot and the beers \"pretty good\". Placed our food order and will never get to review because we never got it. We watched several peeps get and enjoy their food. We left hungry and upset but we dug the bar and atmosphere. Will probably never return as it seems no one gets good promptly."}
{"text":"Came here last night for happy hour with my cycling group.  Black bean burger made in house was awesome, as are their house made chips, BUT the fact that this place offers NO choice of wine for a non beer drinker means I likely won't come back again and rates you only a 3.  I mean I understand you want to show off your craft beers, but NOT everyone likes beer, and sometimes us non beer drinker hang with our beer drinking friends.  How hard would it be to carry at least one white and one red wine choice?"}
{"text":"This is an excellent new brewery in town, and recently has won multiple awards stating that same fact. This one is only about 3 miles from my home. They have good food and great beer. I have tried every beer they have and I have not discovered one that I did not like. The parking lot is ample and the staff is friendly. A lot of tables inside, a good size bar, an island in the idle, and a very nice patio. If you want a good beer, and to support a local brewery, give this a try."}
{"text":"Tried to come on a Saturday afternoon about 3 p.m. The hostess refused to seat a party of one, and there was no seating at the bar or in The Tap Room. There were however five open tables in the dining room where the bar was. I asked the hostess a second time if they would see me, and she said no, so sorry. I've been here before with my family, and had a great lunch and a great experience. Not given the opportunity today, just because I was by myself. Disappointed in this policy. Would give 0 Stars if I could."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We LOVED everything! Totally worth the wait! The atmosphere is wilderness themed just super cool! The beers are delicious. The pulled pork sandwich and onion rings were to die for! My son loved his burger and the bacon was cooked to perfection! A must go to place!"}
{"text":"Great beer brewed on site and very good food. Sat outside and at the inside bar. Friendly staff. Overall positive experience"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and order the following: refuge IPA to drink, duck fat fries (any variation but the flying pig is the best, poutine is a close second), and the peanut butter and jelly jalapeño burger! The burger will blow your mind!! Have been here on multiple occasions the service is always good the food is always great and the beer is always incredible (I would recommend staying away from the sour beers unless you're familiar with them). 5 stars will be back soon!"}
{"text":"After posting my last review Jayelynn immediately messaged me apologizing for my last experience. I was super impressed with their management and will chalk my last experience up to the server having a bad day.  Thanks Jayelynn and Justus, you earned my business back!"}
{"text":"I honestly can't review the food or the beer, we ordered our food but had to leave an hour and 10 mins later before actually receiving it. They seem understaffed. Our server was very sweet and it wasn't her fault, but cmon guys. Probably won't be back, for sure won't be back if I have somewhere else to be."}
{"text":"This place is bomb! Great beer and the burgers are delish. Must try the Az trail burger, has a scrumptious sauce. Sweet potato saison and Futures were my fav beer! Food comaaaaa.. Def going back!"}
{"text":"You have to try their flying  pig cheese fries. We drive from south  west phx just for them"}
{"text":"So far so great!  We tried and truly enjoyed the PB & J Burger with fries!! Yummy when you wouldn't expect it.  try and be surprised.   It's Taco Tuesday so we ordered the daily special fish taco.  Fresh corn tortilla.    I appreciate the fact that this place supports local food artisans.    The tasting room was crowded when we came so maybe call ahead to stake a spot.   Now on to dessert: Cannoli Nacho.  Just delish!  Brittany B. Is the BEST SERVER here!! Thank you."}
{"text":"This is my go-to burger and brew place in Arizona. My favorite is the mushroom and cheese burger. The beer cheese sauce is so addicting and has great flavor. The quality of the brisket patties and house made pickles are evident.  More importantly, the AZ wilderness is one of the best breweries in AZ if not the entire country. Rotating lineup, but you can't go wrong with any of their beers. I wasn't familiar with gose-style beers, but the blood orange gose is a standout.   Expect a wait time of about 30-45 min for peak dinner hours."}
{"text":"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME. A Friend of mine started working here and said it was good...... what an understatement. If you are a fan of supporting local business at it's roots and getting the best possible product than AZ Wilderness is your place.   The beer will blow you away. Better craft brews than San Tan or Four Peaks. The ambiance may not compare but boy does the beer stack up.    There slogan should be \"Like beer? Go here.\""}
{"text":"This is a solid pub, with solid food, a solid atmosphere, with solid offerings, having a solid variety. All in all, it's a solid place. They had a great selection of beers, and their burgers were damned tasty. The duck fat fries were delicious, but not as amazing as some people have made them out to be. They're damned good fries, and you can definitely taste a difference, but it's not something that absolutely changes the game.   At any rate, if you're looking to try some good beers that you probably haven't had before and plump yourself up with a fat-ass burger, then this is a great place to stop by and check out!! Seems like it can get a little busy, but when we went there was no problem getting a seat at the bar."}
{"text":"Food was exceptional, beer was amazing, definitely a place to stop if you like well prepared food and craft beer. I had the apple Brie burger and it was perfect. The only reason I docked them a star was because our service was a little slow and our server seemed to be more interested in chatting up a few cute girls than taking care of our table. I would still make the trip back!"}
{"text":"the food was great. Some of the best wings have had. Yum. Beer good wish more variety but am awesome spot. Come to central phoenix"}
{"text":"*heavy breathing* so we just left this place and *reclines seat and rubs food baby* it was soooo friggin good and except for the 2 leaves of lettuce on my burger, not one bit healthy, just like I like it.  For drinks, I got the Pistachio shake, which is literally nothing like a shake shake, which sounds disappointing but coming from a non-beer drinker, it was very tasty and smoothe.  The meatloaf sliders were a sooo much better than we thought they would be. Pretzel buns were cute, I know, cute doesn't go in a food review but they were and I have a right to my opinion. Haha.  The main course for me was the Hawaiian burger. Let me say, I am not one that agrees that pineapples go on pizza just because I feel like the texture and tastes would clash, but if it tastes anything like my Hawaiian burger, I really need to give it another try because oh my goodness, YUMMMMM!! Beer soaked grilled pineapple, who would've thought?  Then of course. Their signature Duck Fat fries... excuse me, my mouth just watered typing that out. It sounds questionable and it should but it is definitely worth a try because you will not regret it. I ate my husbands and then wanted to order more but.... we opted for the canolli nachos instead, which it tastes as good as the picture looks.  Overall experience: perfectly satisfied!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We've been visiting since the beginning and am so happy this place is expanding! Their burgers and fries are insanely delicious. The waiters/waitresses are always nice and I love how passionate they are about the beer, too.  For all the people complaining about \"pretentious\" beers...maybe expand your palate and world a little bit, then they'll be \"amazing high quality\" beers...a lot of those ingredients they've made sure to find in Arizona. Support your state and a local neighborhood brewery!"}
{"text":"Literally everything I've eaten here has been fantastic! The first time I came was on a local Wednesday special day. I ordered a basil hummus of some sort for an appetizer and it was incredible. I wish it was a staple menu item.   I've had the Reuben burger (twice). BOMB. The side salads are huge and contain a really fresh assortment of mixed greens. Try the raspberry vinaigrette, it's so tasty and has a beautiful pink color! :)  I'm a pretzel fanatic and these ones do not disappoint. So much flavor! And the cheese!  Because everything I had was so good I decided to be daring and try the peanut butter & jalapeño jelly burger. Once again, fantastic! So unique and so much flavor.   Let's not forget, the BEER! They have so many new types every time I come that I tend to order a flight each time! I like how bold they get with their beers. My favorite is the refuge IPA. It is great. Pick yourself up a growler of your favorite cuz it might not be there next time you visit!"}
{"text":"So, I had a fight of 6 Beers so tried most of what they had on tap the only one that I can say that stood out was the Refuge IPA and it was just Ok nothing great, All the beers here where just ok nothing amazing, I been to a ton of breweries and one thing that kinda put a bad taste in my mouth with Arizona Wilderness Brewing they didn't seem to know there own beer what I mean by that is they missed up someones flight twice didn't know the order the placed the beer on the fight, Most brewers I know can tell there own beer by the look of it they were smelling it then a few didn't even know after they tried it and I'm not talking about just the waiter the manager didn't know what was what either.. Keep in mind they did not give the beer they tasted to the customer lol they made a new flight but still was a sad sight to see"}
{"text":"First time didn't know what to expect but really like the place.  Service was great had the boboquavari blonde. And had the good morning burger. Fried and chips were amazing."}
{"text":"Beer and food never disappoint! Only keeps getting better! Green chili sliders are amazing!"}
{"text":"Went out for a friends birthday dinner. We were seated outside by request and it was perfect! Our waitress, Merissa, was very friendly and went through the beer list as gave recommendations. Most of us settled on a flight (5-4oz beers). The flights came out pretty quickly and we enjoyed them with duck fat fries smothered in beer cheese and pulled pork. They were damn delicious. All around the food was so good, the table ordered the grilled cheese, peanut butter burger, BBQ quesadilla, chicken sandwich, and pulled pork taco. Since we were driving the table didn't order anymore beer, but next time I am taking a Lyft because I definitely have a list of beers where I want a full glass. Will absolutely be back to enjoy another meal and many beers."}
{"text":"I've never written a review on Wilderness because I assumed everyone already knew about it and I've been coming here for years, but that's selfish of me. Wilderness is amazing. Period. I feel like anymore more words will be a severe injustice to its greatness. Come here. Order any beer. Get the chicken confit and the PB&J burger and you will not leave disappointed. This place is a gem amongst the overly popular and overrated culinary scene in Gilbert. Why are you still reading this? Stop and just come and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere, food and beer. The spinach dip apetizer was amazing. So unique and the peppers gave it a nice flavor. The burgers and chicken burger were delicious. The Kater was the chicken burger with avacado and arugula and the sandwich was great. The burger bun was almost the best part. The Hawaiian pork burger was huge! The flavors were great, but a little spicy. The chips that came with the burgers were to die for. So delicious. I had one and could not stop eating them. They were perfectly cut, seasoned and just extremely good. For a busy Friday they were quick at getting people in and out of there. Only waited 10 minutes after being told it would be 45 min. We definitely look forward to going here agin."}
{"text":"So good.  Like, I drive out of my way to hit up this Brew Pub.  I don't even like chicken that much and I can't stop ordering the Jalapeno Popper Chicken Burger. It's juicy and flavorful which I'm pretty sure involves some sort of black magic.  The bartenders (I've only sat at the bar) are very helpful in discerning which of their wonder-brews will please your palate and if you can't decide order a flight!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible! Sit on the patio even in the summer with their HUGE swamp coolers!!"}
{"text":"Pretty darned good brews and burgers. Best brewery I've been to in the valley since moving from the SLC area a few years ago. As far as burgers are concerned, Lucky 13 still has them beat by a mile, although I don't know if I will ever find another place with burgers like theirs.   PACKED on the weekends at dinner time. They should really consider either opening a new location, expanding seating, or coming up with a better wait method for their customers. Although, it does give you the opportunity to sample in the tasting room.   Seriously excellent beers though."}
{"text":"FINALLY, got to give this place a go and I must say I'm hooked.   Place was crazy busy on early Sunday afternoon and parking, well FUGGET a'bout it!!  Friggin nightmare and had to park in the motel behind the restaurant.  Luckily powered through and made my way in. Seems I was rewarded by the parking gods as I was able to find two seats at the bar top in the tasting room just as two people were leaving.   Bar tenders very very friendly and all too eager to recommend which burger was their favorite and why.  And of course what do I order. The chicken drumsticks confit. Now these little drumlets of black magic with habanero mustard sauce were very good I think I'll stick with a burger next time. (Wasn't a big fan of the small shards of bone in the drumlets). Just a personal preference for me.    My buddy ordered the trail blaze burger and allowed me a bite and yep. Burgers are where it's at with house made chips or fries made in duck fat. Mmmmm   Now for the beer.  I only had the Refugee IPA and instantly it is now one of favorites on a very short list.  Clearly American Wilderness has put a lot of work into their food and beers. High quality all around with great execution and flavors.    Until next time--I'm talking to you Peanut Butter and Jalapeño jelly burger!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent beer and food.  In the age of micro and craft breweries this place is a cut above the rest in my opinion."}
{"text":"Just loved it. It was busy but there is a reason. 5 stars period. Got the Rueben burger and the apple Brie burger. Both amazing. Fresh made chips and the pretzel appetizer was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great beer, always rotating styles I would have never thought of. Food is amazing. Get here for lunch and avoid the long lines for dinner. Place gets packed after 3pm everyday. They use fresh locally sourced meat and produce. Quality is second to none."}
{"text":"Good place for drinking and tasting local brews, the food was also very good. Highly recommend the pretzel bite app, goes good with the local brews while watching the game. Only down side was the wait staff, was a little anal and uptight. Definitely is a good family setting for eating and drinking joint BUT not a place to get loud and rowdy"}
{"text":"Great food! Staff very pleasant. Great atmosphere. We went in a big group and they easily accomodated us."}
{"text":"When my daughter came to town with her boyfriend it was mandatory we hit a few breweries. This one came \"highly recommend\". We arrived later on a Sunday night so seating wasn't an issue and decided to start in the tap room and sit at the bar.   As I might of mentioned before I don't really drink much beer but the staff were so friendly and and genuinely nice that it was difficult to resist the free samples they kept giving us to try. The bartender told me \"we'll keep having you try some until you find something you like\"!!  Yes! It's a wild combo but get the duck fat fries with pulled pork and beer cheese. It's a perfect starter to share. We also had the green chili pork sliders and cheeseburger. All the food was really good with plenty to eat. There are daily specials each night too so be sure to check these out.   This place is a about a 30 minute drive out of the Scottsdale area and well worth it. They've got a great selection of beers and staff went out of there way to make us happy. The live music on the outside patio was a nice touch too."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic place. If you follow my reviews, you'll notice I am a bit of a beer snob. Not the worse problem in the world in my view. That said, I tried all their beers via flights and they were all good, most excellent. One of the best breweries I have sampled. My good friend once said, \"generally speaking, great breweries have great food\".  Well, this was true once again.  Got the pretzel sticks with mustard and cheese and it was excellent for an app. I then tried the staff recommended PB and jalapeño burger and it was tremendous!  So flavorful, so unique, I can't give it enough props. I would absolutely get it again but have three other burgers I also want to try. Anyhow, two strong thumbs up if your travels bring you to the phx area, you won't be disappointed, unless you are an eeyore."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times and have nothing bad to say about the place. I've had about 15 different things on the menu and they're all amazing. Haven't had a single beer I disliked and the variety is great along with the Arizona sourced ingredients in some. The food is flat out amazing. Best pretzels I've ever had in my life along with the best burger(pb and jalepeno jelly) the jalepeno popper chicken sandwich is probably the best chicken sandwich I've ever had too. Can't go wrong with anything off the menu from my experience. The chefs can probably crap on a piece of bread and make it taste amazing. Try this place out! Not to mention good service!"}
{"text":"The place is always crazy busy, which is a sign.  My husband's favorite burger is the jalapeño peanut butter bacon burger - yep, said it's amazing.  Friends went with us for their first visit and they said their burgers were the best they'd ever had!  The service is great and burgers include house made chips (duck oil) and uncharge to fries.  Not a lot of \"healthy food\" options, but they have salads and the beet salad was very good.  Lots of beer - enough said :)"}
{"text":"i really enjoyed this place, went there with a small group of friends for lunch. they have good beer and several different choices in hamburgers on their menu."}
{"text":"Stellar saison, cool atmosphere. Very knowledgable staff. Hope these guys start distributing soon since this is unfortunately not anywhere near my neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I had the best ground chicken burger I've ever had!  Not to mention they're homemade potatoe chips!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Meh. It was alright. The food was ok and the beer was ok and I LOVE that the patio is dog friendly. I was really disappointed in our server. He seemed as if we were really inconveniencing him and he had far better things to do than take our orders. Maybe he had a really bad day, who knows? Either way, I won't be fighting my way back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Good food and excellent selection of beers.to bad they are always super busy and you often times have to wait a bit for an open table."}
{"text":"Updating my previous review to mention how amazingly they pulled off their expansion. Additional seating capacity, great open atmosphere tasting room, and now 30+ taps. Their only problem will be brewing enough beer to keep them full!"}
{"text":"Laid back atmosphere , and a place where you can actually have a conversation . Being an IPA kind of guy , went with their Refuge IPA - smooth , not too hoppy and didn't feel like at all 6.7% ABV , thumbs up overall !! Paired the beer with their chili pulled pork sliders , amazing stuff - HIGHLY RECOMMEND !! The only caveat about this place is it is lit up like the Cowboys Stadium , they seriously need to tone the lights down to give it more of a bar feel !!"}
{"text":"Always a wondrous variety of beers.  The only thing that prevents me from offering that fifth star is approach to hops in their beers.   It's trendy these days, many people love the happiness, I personally feel that not all styles of beer require a heavy hand with both the buttering and finishing hops"}
{"text":"The beer is alright, the food is mediocre. Lots of kinks to work out in their first two months of being open. Hopefully time will help them perfect the good thing they have started."}
{"text":"My favorite beer in Arizona! So sad the willie Nelson is gone but I find a new favorite every time I'm there. The new outdoor patio is beautiful and great for groups. Perfect for happy hour. There's one waitress with gauges (sorry forgot name!) there who goes above and beyond every time deliver exceptional service. Other staff is good but every time I go I try to sit in her section."}
{"text":"Utterly appalled. Went there for a work function today which hefted a mighty tab. A few of us stragglers stayed enjoying camaraderie and beer (responsibly). As we had finished our beer, and were talking for a bit without a full pint in front of each of us, we were approached by a staff member asking us if we could vacate our table as we are \"obviously no longer buying beer\" and she wanted to give our seating to paying customers. Pardon me? Did I pay my bill with my good looks? Yes, the company footed the major bill, but the beer after was on us. To be fair she did say that we could go to the tasting room and they have more beer there. But to me, that's not the point. I am a paying customer, enjoying good food, good beer and great company in a responsible fashion, not bothering anyone. ADDITIONALLY, a part of enjoying our beer RESPONSIBLY is not having a full beer in front of us each and every moment. You have water or a soda or something in between.   I am saddened at the level of service Wilderness now finds appropriate. It will, and has, cost you loyal customers. Unfortunately, this is strike two for Wilderness. We had gone another time after work as it is convenient and we liked the vibe. As I went with come tradesmen from the shop that were not business casual but more working warriors, we were looked at as though we were not good enough to be there by the hostess and snootily told that there was a \"long wait\" when the dining room was obviously near empty. Huh? Did I accidentally stumble on the Waldorf Astoria in Chandler? We liked you. We were there when you had just opened and had a few beers, even less food , virtually no one in your dining room and drive through bagels next door.   I gave it two stars as the food is good (and getting better as they have expanded the menu), their beer is good and the vibe (if you don't count the \"Astorians\") is good. But the service has definitely taken a SERIOUS dive. Too bad.  Goodbye Wilderness. Not waiting around for strike three. I liked you better than Santan for your vibe, but now they have just regained their spot. At least they don't ask me to leave my table."}
{"text":"great food, cool atmosphere in an odd location. good place for a date or groups."}
{"text":"Loved it! Magnificent beer, fantastic food. And the service was exceptional. Make sure you try the duck fries."}
{"text":"Wasn't a big fan of the beer selection, but I'm completely bias. I will say the highlight of this trip was the burger I had. The chips were subpar, but my friends told me that was a one-off. I'll be heading backwards here soon to give it another shot. Can't be leaving my review at 3 stars for one-offs!"}
{"text":"Great beer and food! Staff are very friendly and the weekends are very busy 45 mins to an hour wait BUT it passes pretty quick when you are at their tasting bar. Wonderful beer selection from their brew. Definitely will be back, great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I came here as one of the stops on my bar hopping experience for my bachelor party for dinner and beer. I felt the beer was up to par, but I felt like other people had hyped me up to the food too much. And the wait to get in was a little excessive for coming on a Wednesday evening. The food wasn't my thing, but as a beer lover these people know what they are doing. I would probably just come back just for beer and appetizers."}
{"text":"The best Beer Burgers and Frys in AZ. If you're like me, a man who likes man shit then you'll love Wilderness. If you're not like me you'll probably still love it too."}
{"text":"This place changed my mind about dark beers.  They always have something exciting on tap the food is delicious and the staff is always friendly and have a great sense of humor."}
{"text":"Delicious beer and tasty food! Cool atmosphere. This place would hold its own in Washington or Colorado as a great brewpub. Love the outdoorsy theme and photos also. Very friendly service and everyone seems excited to be working there. The location blows, much like the location of almost everything in Phoenix. No big deal though, I plan to return. Really the only improvement would be if they put up some fabric decorations to dampen the sound inside."}
{"text":"I ordered the mushroom & cheese burger with a black bean burger instead of beef and onion rings and it was fiiiiiire! The beer cheese sauce had me drooling like a bulldog and the waitress brought me more napkins to clean up my slobby mess before I even thought to ask! Onion rings were surprisingly sweet and sooo good. My bf had to cut me off bc I would've eaten SO many that my tummy would hurt and I'd have to take a nap... The beer flight topped off the meal perfectly - I'd highly recommend the watermelon goose and July 11th IPA! I wasn't into the lavender beer (mostly because it taste like a tree), BUT totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"As a local brewery and burger junkie, this is my favorite I've found in Phoenix. Unique, quality beers with frequent new creations. Hamburgers are top notch, high quality beef (and bison). Must try the PB and J burger. I know it's sounds gross, but you'll be blown away. Cool staff and management. I'm a huge fan."}
{"text":"You can tell that these guys love brewing. Great beer, really good food and spectacular service. We appreciated the explanation/description of each of the beers. The sampler is a great way to go to get a taste of each. Very competitive pricing. There will be many return visits!"}
{"text":"Food melts in your mouth! And I am picky about good food. Expect a 30 min wait to sit on weekends."}
{"text":"BEST PLACE EVER!!!!!!!!  Incredible beer.  I follow the brewers on Instagram.. They use all locally sourced ingredients when ever possible..  Keep up the GREAT WORK!"}
{"text":"Duh!  Place is stupid good; start with the beer, all of it is good.  Their staple Refuge is one of the best ipa's I'd ever had.  Now their food, all if it has a AZ flare and is sooo good.  Best burger in the valley."}
{"text":"We scarfed down our food so fast I didn't have a chance to take a photo ha. We've been here a few times and the food and service is always great! Got the meatloaf sliders and my bf got this chicken and green chili sandwich. Our server this time Peyton was great and made great suggestions on what to order. Ask for her when you come in!"}
{"text":"The hype is well deserved... really interesting beers and great food. You MUST order the green chile sliders- best I've ever had the pleasure to enjoy!   Really looking forward to the new Gilbert location opening! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I think, in order to give you a good idea of this place, I SHOULD WRITE MY ENTIRE REVIEW IN CAPS LOCK BECAUSE IT'S REALLY LOUD IN HERE. I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW THE SERVERS HEAR THE ORDERS.  Whew, ok, that's enough of that.  Came here on a Friday night and the place was packed! It has to be good when there's an 1.5 hour wait for a table, right?  Fortunately,  there's a beer garden and the weather was nice. Tried some grapefruit gose that was horrible, and an IPA that was fine.   We make it to a table (hooray!) and the waitress (who was doing a helluva job--girl got that hustle!) takes our order: we get artichoke dip for the table, and I ordered the peanut butter and jalapeño jelly burger.  The appetizer was...ok. I wondered if maybe they don't have dishes, because it came out in like one of those paper bowls you get soup in at the grocery store. It was not very generous, either, and after such a long wait, we were ravenous and this did not hit the spot.  The food came out not long after. I expected some kind of gooey peanut-buttery drippy mess, but it was just a dollop of peanut butter and a dollop of jelly. Tasted good, but not what I expected. And the onion rings I got with it...literally 5 rings. I counted, and then sang about \"5 golden riiiings!\" All joking aside, onions are not expensive. Load me up.  All-in-all, a decent meal, an interesting beer menu, and some great beard-spotting, but you better enjoy your company because you're gonna be here a while."}
{"text":"Something can be said for a brewery that is written as best brewery in the nation by Esquire.   Let's start with the beer.  What is alluring about this place is that they have their usual beers (Refuge IPA and Superstition Mountain Coffee Stout), and then their other beers are almost \"limited edition\" (can't really think of another way to describe it). What I mean by this is that they will brew a certain beer with the highest quality ingredients, they will cask some, and when it's gone, it's gone. I think this is a very cool thing and it definitely keeps me coming back to see what's new and exciting.  On to the food.  This place is not afraid to get adventurous with flavors. They combine some of the best flavors - flavors conducive to salivating. And, my top reason to love their food??? Two words. DUCK FAT.   Let us end this review on said words."}
{"text":"Very good food! Pretty solid service, was seated immediately and server came pretty quick with water and we ordered drinks and apps- burger was very good! Duck fat fries we're awesome! Planning on being a regular when I'm out riding!"}
{"text":"Awesome beers, awesome food (From what I have heard and smelled), awesome staff!!!   I have let it be known, I LOVE craft beer... from the science to the marketing... and Arizona Wilderness has done a fabulous job.  I first got the Refuge IPA and it will be my go to beer at this place when I do not want to venture outside my beer happy place.  Next I went outside my traditional pallet and tried the sour beer, the Bear Wallow Berliner Weisse.  It was very tart, just like a sour beer should be with a nice smoothness.  The wife had the specialty Peanut Brittle Ale... this is one of the best specialty ales I have ever tasted, and she enjoyed it as well.  Overall, best craft beer I have tasted across the board in the Phoenix area.    The staff was equally amazing.  Very friendly and knowledgeable.  Great to talk to and even offered some other craft suggestions in the area.... all while handling an overly drunk woman with great professionalism (cutting her off and handling her tantrum).    I will certainly head back before I leave the Phoenix area!    P.S. We did not try the food, but the wait for the restaurant was crazy, so they are obviously doing something well."}
{"text":"So much to go over with our experience here last night!  Arrived after 7:30 and was an hour wait. Place was packed! We asked if there was open seating in the bar: in which the hostesses stated if we could find a table there to let them know & they would take us off the wait list.   There are two different locations to get beer. One small shop area that carries their beer selections & souvenirs. At the other end of the restaurant is the main bar. We actually found an open table for two & sat down. We were there less than five minutes & the manager came over and told us we couldn't sit there? He stated that it was for guest on the wait list and there was only ONE area to sit at the bar top & not the surrounding tables. That was full! So, we got up and went back over to that other / smaller location to order a beer. The young gal bartender wasn't to pleasant. She seemed impatient & not to personable. Had the Excalibur & Hero in a Half Shell. Excalibur was dry hop w/ Amarillo & Sonora White Wheat. HHS is also a Sonora White Wheat with a hint of lime, mandarin & mosaic. Both were average.  When we were called for seating ( little after an hour) we actually ended up at the table we originally sat down at. LOL What are the odds of that?! Started with the chicken drumstick confit. Didn't care for them-only had one! Not sauced, just a little salt & pepper & on the greasy side ' cause they're cooked in their own fat! We added blue cheese to dip which was recommend by our server. It wasn't as good as his recommendation.  *NOTE: everything added is an up charge. All side sauces are .99 cents each per sauce. If ordering a burger it comes with \"chips\" ( in-house sliced then fried potato thins). If you want to \"sub\" for : onion rings, duck fat fries, salad it's $2.50 more. It gets pretty pricey so \"watch out\"!!  Burgers we ordered: Good Morning Burger $12.99 & Mushroom N Beer Cheese Burger $12.29. Morning bun was soggy on the bottom & two toasted on the top. Mushroom burger didn't have much mushroom to it. Both burgers patties were smaller than the bun (yet somewhat higher) than the bun. Shrunken patties @ an expensive price. Both burgers were extremely bland. Added on the side was the duck fat fries that were undercooked & the beer battered onion rings were squishy. No crispness to them \"at all\"!   Accompanied in our baskets were ranch ( that was stated by our server). I had request the garlic aioli. He then told me \" that is\" I said: \"no this is ranch\", he brought me another one that looked similar & still tasted like ranch with a hint of garlic. \"I'm sorry\" , but Aioli's are generally a thicker mayonnaise consistency with fresh garlic. This was no where near it! The homemade ketchup is way to sweet. The worst thing I've ever put in my mouth was the sriracha maple ketchup. It was just awful.. YUCK!! The Honey Sweet BBQ sauce tasted like KC Masterpiece. Nothing spectacular about these house-made sauces, that they charge additionally for!   The server was Jeff. He was ok. Kitchen I'm sure was on over load, so long of a wait on our meals to arrive to our table. Jeff did get irritated to when I had asked for that garlic aioli. LOL  This unfortunately won't be a place we will return. We can say we \"tried it\",  but it's not \"all that\"!  Very disappointed that a burger cost anywhere from $10-$15 and you then have to then pay additional for all and any sides / sauces.  To expensive!"}
{"text":"What can I say? The beer is great. I love how they switch out their flavors based on what is available by their vendors at that time. It's not really a seasonal thing, it's more so what ever they feel like creating this time around.   There were a lot of people in both the brewery/bar and in the restaurant. The wait was about 20 minutes but we could order a drink and wait outside under the misters. That made time go by faster.   A must try is the jalapeño jelly and peanut butter burger. You could taste both the jelly and peanut butter but it didn't overpower the flavor of the burger itself. It was a mouthful of flavor! I ordered my burger with their chips which was nice and crispy, but people have recommended the duck fat fries so my husband ordered those with his burger. Either way, both great choices."}
{"text":"They only serve beer.  My girlfriend doesn't like beer, she drinks wine. They don't serve wine.  The place is decent, good pub food with OK beer, but since they don't serve wine, we will not be back.  Seems very short sighted."}
{"text":"The brewers here are very productive.  They are always trying to brew a new and unique beer for their customers and they do a great job.  I've only had a few brews here and so far I really enjoy their Refuge IPA and DC Mountain Double IPA.  This place can get super busy on the weekends so be prepared for that.  I look forward to trying more brews from them and even some items off their food menu."}
{"text":"AZ Wilderness never disappoints. We love the atmosphere, the fresh local ingredients, the unique brews but most of all the service. We are treated like family every time we come to AZ and tonight was no different. Bryce took great care of us. The waffle batter onion rings are a must have!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The atmosphere is amazing. I love the staff, they're always laid back and helpful. And the beer is awesome!! I would suggest the green chili pork sliders, they're so good  it is a perfect place for date night or when you want a good beer"}
{"text":"Certainly not the best new brewery in the world.  Four Peaks easily in my opinion is the best local place for beer and food.  Long wait for a table and then an equally long wait for service.  Take a lesson from Four Peaks and learn how to handle crowds.  The beers-yes they are different but just because they are different doesn't mean that they are all good.  I liked the IPA but the berliner weiss was disgusting. A real drain pour.  Food when it finally did arrive was extremely salty.  Giving it two stars because I did like the IPA."}
{"text":"Beer great and although they run out of stuff guess we'll just have to go back. Loved the little sliders and bartender very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"The best craft brewery in all of AZ. Love the sours and saisons they put put and the draft menu is constantly rotating so there's always new stuff to try. The flights are a killer deal and gives you a taste of everything they have to offer. I hope they keep on doing what they're doing and don't sell out like four peaks did because the new beers,  experimentation, and just general love of crafting unique beers is what keeps me coming back for more. The food is good but just good. I appreciate their use of local ingredients and respect of vegan and vegetarian diets but the prices are a bit much. At $12.99+ for burgers, I expect at least some fries. Nonetheless, they are always packed at these prices so I understand and won't knock them for using basic economics to price everything. In the end, they are a brewery and that's what I'll rate them on. Keep on doing what you're doing guys and looking forward to checking out your dt phx location."}
{"text":"Get the peanut butter and jalapeño jelly burger with the local beef medium rare, and a side of duck fat fries. Thank me later.   Killer service (Tony). Killer beer (Belgian Expression). Killer food!"}
{"text":"I was honestly expecting this to be quite a bit better. Their Stout was bland and my mushroom cheeseburger, while good, lacked something. This place gets a lot of good reviews, and the service was pretty good, so I guess I'll just chalk it up to my personal taste. This is me whining. Wah!"}
{"text":"This is a review from a wine lover. Went here for a bday party and this place does not serve wine / liquor, only a few beers. Just writing this as an FYI to anyone expecting a variety of drink choices. Not a beer person....? Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The beer was pretty delicious and so was the food. I recommend the Belgian pale ale or the lil guy rye. Yum! The pork fries with beer cheese and the jalapeño meatloaf sliders were the stars or the show though.  Our server was a little bit of a space cadet, but overall we had a great time and will be back soon."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place all around! Arriving at 1pm on a Saturday, we were told there was a 20 minute wait. In the meantime, my husband enjoyed a beer (Petting Feral Cats) in their tasting room. At right about that 20 minute mark, we were seated in the dining room.  Busy as the place was, the service was excellent the whole time. My husband ordered a beer flight and the famed Flying Pig Fries. He was a happy man. I had some of the meat and cheese and was really impressed by the tenderness and combination of flavors. The fries seemed to hold up well to their cheesy, meaty burden, too.  I had the Fruit and Nut Salad. The bowl is big but somewhat shallow, and there is a lot of goodness in there! Wow was that a good salad. The fruit was perfectly fresh and ripe and the house-made beer vinaigrette was excellent.  My husband had the Arizona Trail Burger. Again, he was very happy with everything from the doneness of the meat to the pretzel bun. I stole a little piece of bun, too; great texture and char to it.  My husband liked all of their beers and had our growler filled with stout to go home. He loved this place. The selection wasn't as big for me (just two salads on the menu) but the one I had was fantastic, so I wouldn't be opposed at all to coming here again! Too bad we live on the opposite side of the valley."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here.. you do have the wait to get a table here (that's how busy it can get here) but they do have a great selection of beer and the food is pretty good.. the only thing negative I can say about this place is upgrading to onion rings you expect to get more but no they only gave 5 onion rings with my boyfriends grilled cheese.."}
{"text":"I'm excited to have the craft beer movement erupt in the Phoenix East Valley. Gilbert's Arizona Wilderness Brewing Company is one of the pioneers spearheading this effort, and East Valley residents (like myself) have been eagerly following their progress. I've stopped by this place on several occasions and had nothing but pleasant experiences sampling their newest craft brew offerings.  One particularly notable experience took place near their grand opening. One of the house beers they were offering was an unusual sour beer known to afficionados as a \"Berliner Weisse\" style. Most don't realize that although this is a wheat beer, it will strike you as highly sour, due to a step in the brewing process in which Lactobacillus (yogurt bacteria) are introduced. I personally dislike trying to grunt down the straight, tart brew in its most naked format, therefore I like to drink it as I have had it served in its birthplace, Berlin, Germany. So, equipped with my bottle of green woodruff syrup (a.k.a. Waldmeister), I dared to quaff down the sour stuff... but this time tempered with a shot of delicious candy/herbal woodruff syrup!  This is the way to drink Berliner Weisse! I shared my syrup with any takers at the bar who were interested. I knew that I was in the presence of some scholared beer drinkers when I shared some with one of the bearded brewers at the establishment.  I hope that the next time they serve their Berliner Weisse, they offer patrons an accompanying shot of either raspberry or woodruff syrup.  It may sound heretical to suggest adding sugary syrup to beer, but trust me... it's as traditional as it gets.  Although I haven't had a chance to properly sample all of the menu offerings here, I am pleased with the duck fat fries... exquisitely crunchy and luxuriously flavorful. A perfect snack to go with all of the interesting beers this new brewery keeps coming up with.  I love having the Arizona Wilderness in my back yard... especially when it allows one to \"duck\" and cover and camouflage oneself behind a tasty glass of bier!"}
{"text":"Veggie lovers are not treated well here. My server called me the scrawniest guy in the world.   The fries are cooked in duck fat. Pretentious. They offer a poor selection that rotates into a worse selection and no sour beer. Won't return."}
{"text":"It's been two years since I wrote a review for Arizona Wilderness Brewing. Not a thing has changed. It still has GREAT beer and GREAT food. The only difference is now everyone knows it! Sometimes it gets super-crowded . . . so pick your time carefully. Don't let the crowds scare you off . . . they are all great folks just looking for the same great experience as you are.  Beer and burgers. Friendly staff. Lots of parking. Beer and burgers. Beer and burgers."}
{"text":"Sitting on the patio. 2 gals standing here and will not serve us. They said we have to go to the bar to get served. WTF what is wrong with this???  I asked a guy server to fetch me a beer and he promptly did. I guess the 2 gals standing around shouldn't be paid much. Or what are they here for...to seat people?"}
{"text":"Crowded and loud.  No room in the inadequate parking lot.  Had to park far away--long walk for the five of us--two of us being over age 50.  It was more than a 20 minute wait for a table.  Inside of the restaurant was so dark it was hard to read the menus.  Five burgers/fries, three beers, two soft drinks, no appetizers--bill was over $100.  Ridiculous!  Food?  Everyone else enjoyed their burger.  Mine was terrible.  I ordered the first one on the menu (can't recall the name--Arizona Trails burger maybe?)  It had pepperjack cheese, a pepper and BBQ sauce on it.  Didn't even finish half as it was so awful.  The onion rings were soggy and limp.  Had to ask for some ranch to dip them in.  Took forever for our waitress to visit after our food was dropped off.  Did not bother complaining about my burger as I anticipated another long wait for a replacement and didn't want to bother with it.  Service was fair.  Had a hard time looking at my waitress with all the metal hanging out of what was an otherwise pretty face.  I've seen pictures in National Geographic of primitive cultures with *fewer* face/body piercings than this young woman had.  Admittedly, I have a personal bias against tattoos and body piercings, but honestly, I don't think much of a restaurant who allows their employees to be fully adorned in face metal.  It's gross to look at.  No, I'm not a prude.  The craft beers were nothing special.  I tried two different IPAs and frankly I've had better.  Usually I would say that I'd be willing to give it another try and maybe revise my review, but I think I'll pass on this one.    No parking High prices Loud, dark atmosphere Long wait for a table Food and drink substandard  Not worth my trouble and money to give it another chance."}
{"text":"So we came here last night for a friends birthday. We were a party of about 8 or so. The server was awesome and very attentive. Since this was our first time my hubby and i shared a flight of 5 beers. 3 out 5 were super amazing the 4th was so - so and the sour lemon ginger beer ...umm .. no .. doesn't mean it was bad just not our cup of tea/beer. We couldn't stay too long so we also shared the artichoke green chili dip with chips. Was pretty good no complaints, maybe a few more chips to go with it. But as the rest of the table started to get their meals definitely made my husband and I so badly want to come back and try one of their burgers smelled and looked amazing and HUGE !!!! So yes we will come again !  Btw very cool inside and outside atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not a bad place but I think its a bit overrated. The food was decent but bar'ish. Seemed like they were out of alot of menu items and beer. Overall I would come back but wouldnt be in a hurry to do so."}
{"text":"First time visit with our two boys and they did not disappoint. Our server McKenley made our experience special. He made great suggestions on beer and brought out samples until we were sold on our favorites. The service was great! We had the bacon and beer cheese fries which were filling and really hit the spot. The burgers are flavorful with the most amazing bun I've ever tasted.  We will definitely return and we'll be requesting McKenley for sure. His personality and his knowledge of the menu made our first time experience perfect!"}
{"text":"We came in on kind of a slow Wednesday night which was cool because I am aware that this place gets absolutely packed. I had a hamburger with their duck fat fries which was delicious and the person who came with me also had something along the same lines. We really enjoyed our meals. It was an enjoyable experience.   There does seem to be a lot going on and my only negative for our night out was that our waitress had a table of friends who came in and she would check on our table and then go sit down at her friends table which wasn't a bit odd to me to be so casual about that directly in our line of sight. It was odd because she only checked on us once after bringing our drinks out but definitely not a big enough thing to ruin the night. If I were in a hurry or in need of something though I can see myself getting annoyed pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Great beer--nice variety focusing on local influences. We've been here several times with  small and large parties. Parking is always a hassle. Service is friendly and competent but slow. Great patio ambiance. Inside seating can be hot in summer. Try the onion rings and the duck fat fries--yummy! Save room for the cannoli nachos for dessert. We've tried most if the menu and very item is fresh, locally -sources when possible, and delicious. Faster service is the only thing preventing a 5 star rating here."}
{"text":"This place rocks! We stopped in on a busy Saturday night and put our names down for a group of 8. The wait was about 30-40 minutes for our table, but you can head into the tasting room and chat over beers while you wait.   First I tried the Wet Beaver ... which wasn't my style as much as I'd have liked it to be. Next I tried the Aravaipa Abbey Dubbel and it was a hit. They have a small selection of Monastic style ales, all with names originating from things in the desert. I wish we would have remembered to fill our Growler! There are tons of beer choices to choose from, the building interior is neat and it seems like a great crowd all around. This may be my new favorite Phoenix brewery!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and beer! They had tasty standard brews and some really unique and creative beers as well. My husband and I enjoyed each of the beers we tried and were stunned at how inexpensive they were considering the size of the samples. The food was delicious- my meat eating husband and I (the vegetarian) agree. Everything on the menu sounded good but we settled on a fancy grilled cheese for me and a burger for him. Both were done in unique ways that set these standard dish above others. The portion sizes were generous and we both left stuffed and happy. I will be recommending this place to everyone and for sure returning."}
{"text":"This is a really good brewery with tasty food.  Didn't have any beers this time, but will in the future.  The southwest chicken club sandwich with duck fat fries is really good - it is a tad spicy so be prepared.  Looking forward to trying others things when I return.  Staff was very friendly and attentive.  Might be the best brewery I've been to in Arizona."}
{"text":"5-star! My husband and I love to visit this place :) we just found out there is a birthday beer mug for $3 any beer choice and Ps it's a huge mug! I had a delicious chicken sandwich and my husband had the peanut butter and jalapeño jelly hamburger which he loved. We love most of the beers they create and always come back to try the new offerings. Def a date night out for us!"}
{"text":"Oh wilderness, we love you so! My husband and I have been patiently waiting for a brewery in Gilbert. and BOOM! here comes the Arizona Wilderness Brewing Co. Always super tasty beers, friendly staff, and the burgers... GOOD GOD those burgers. YummY YummY YummY! Did I mention I love the burgers? Its also a great place to watch a game as well. But come early because this place can get packed. Go order a yummy beer brewed with local ingredients and get burger!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Hands down, favorite brewery in Arizona, one of my favorites in the nation.  It's nice to see their success and expansion and I expect to see greater things form them.    It pains me to read some of the negative reviews insofar as, most of these folks just don't get it.  The jabs at the \"beer snobs\" and complaints about esoteric beers - either they're stuck in the 90's or simply sour graping it.  Do I miss some of my favorite beers here when they go off tap and move on to something else?  Definitely.  Does the inventiveness and risks in trying experimental beers make up for it?  Yes, definitely.  I've seen an improvement in the food since they hired a new chef to oversee their food program.  Over any other single food item on the menu, I'd pick one of their burgers.  They excel when they keep the food simple.  My one food gripe was with a pulled pork sandwich I once ordered.  It was sub-par.  The meat was soft and moist but the flavor and the sauce were really off.  My wife, though, was impressed with their confit chicken drumsticks.  They're served dry but they are well seasoned and the confit keeps the meat deliciously soft.  People rave about the fries - they are good.  Better duck fat fries are to be had elsewhere, but these are just fine.  I realize that I spent more time complaining about the haters in this review than about the positives - I think it's justified.  But I'll end with this:  Arizona Wilderness Brewing's beers will not disappoint you.  They will surprise you.  At times they will blow you away.  Craft brewers like these guys keep the industry fresh and forward-moving."}
{"text":"Good beers but always be prepared for a long wait to get in.  They serve food as well but I have yet to have anything on the menu that I would say tastes above mediocre."}
{"text":"Good beers, but I felt like there were limited styles. Both times I went there I felt my options were dark beers and an IPA. They were good, but when it's hot out a nice light lager or hoppy pale can be golden. It looks like their taps change pretty regularly so I wouldn't be surprised if it was just timing.   They have vegan tacos for Tuesday tacos if you take out the cheese, which were pretty good and my husband enjoyed the black bean burger. I haven't tried it so I haven't asked if it's vegan.   Seeing how close it is to us and the quality of beer, we will likely go back again. Especially if we know when they are rotating their taps which they specify on their website.   With other beer spots close to us having the usual suspects on their beer menu (i.e. Bud, Coors, etc.) this is a magical place and should be appreciated."}
{"text":"Im not a beer drinker, so I probably can't rate this place fairly. The staff seemed to really not care about anything at all. The food was mediocre and expensive."}
{"text":"Best burger (mushrooms and beer cheese! ) I've ever had! You have to try the fries, duck fat sounds weird but omg amazing. Finished our meal with the desert nachos, once again amazing! They need to open one of these in ct! The only negative is its very loud/crowded but it's so worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Update: Spoke with manager and she compromosed with me and took off some of the charges. Be proactive if you go here! If asked what side you want, ask if there is an upcharge as you may not be told. Make it clear that a community table is not ok, if you don't want to sit with strangers, (before you've already been seated and ordered). I still believe this restaurant is over priced and they nickel and dime you (more like $2.50 you) but I'm willing to give it another try.  Overpriced burgers and small selection of beers. Paid $60 for a couple of burgers and 2 beers. Very disappointed in the food and to make the extremely loud atmosphere even worse, they seated a chatty couple at our table who talked nonstop. Community table for this price? Will NOT be back. Oh and the beers, one 5 oz and one 10 oz..."}
{"text":"I went here with 4 of my friends because we heard it was good food and a good vibes. The food was good, not great, but good. However, we waiting an hour and a half to get our five burgers. And the manager told me that to compensate for it, he would take our three beers off our bill. We ended up getting 25% off the bill as well, but I don't think this fully compensated how long we waited for this meal. I was very unsatisfied with my experience here and I don't know if I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection, great food and they play good music to boot. Hard to beat as a place to meet casually."}
{"text":"I would have given a 5 star, but the waitress Jaymee was little bit slow is our request. She took a whole 20 minutes to get a glass of water and beer. When they served the food they missed the silver ware and took another 15 minutes.  But you can't deny the food and beer. The beer tasted amazing. Has a pecan stout beer which had a mellow taste and not too strong.   The been burger was one of the best I have ever had. It just blew my taste palate away. It's a shame I couldn't finish it. They have only one vegetarian option, but no complaints there.   I would totally recommend this place. They have a very wide variety of beer selection."}
{"text":"Never coming here again, thieving basterds took extra money out of my credit card.... my friend and I came to an agreement that he would cover the tip since I bought the beer. He tipped $12.00 for a $66 dinner bill.... I guess that wasn't good enough."}
{"text":"Great food and fast, friendly service. I had the Makin' Bacon Grilled Cheese....it was delicious! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, beer and service.  What more can you ask for?  I do wish they were located more in the central valley area, but I will gladly keep making the drive out :)  Get the pretzels and beer cheese.  Also, their beef and brisket burgers are great."}
{"text":"Beer and food are awesome! But the hostess need to be a lot better in coordinating with cudtomers."}
{"text":"Tried two beers here, wasn't really happy with either of them. I totally would have tried quite a few more but between the 8+ servers nobody in here is being helped. So we decided to leave early and eat somewhere else. Update : she finally came to help us as I was writing this."}
{"text":"Their food never disappoints, I had a Hawaiian burger delicious, my husband had the Trail burger and son had After The Hike burger we all loved our burgers.  Our server Christy was very attentive came back several times to ask us if everything was OK or if she could get us anything else.  A note to management, we arrived at 11:30 and you barely had opened, your women's restroom appeared to not have been cleaned which was in itself a disappointment. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Place has really come a long way in a short time. always loved the inventive, solid craft brews. The pretzels used to be my favorite, but the menu has grown to be really good. Loved the PBJ burger, the 'merican fries are among the best I've had. Really great staple taps with solid rotation and guest beers.  love coming here to try new things - tonight it's making bacon sandwich, expecting greatness! This has rapidly become one of my regular favorites."}
{"text":"Fan of their Stout. Unfortunately we didn't read it on the menu and they have a sampler.. super cool comes out on what looks like a log with holes and they have the different beers for tasting.  The sour beer was.. a melted down warhead inside of glass and just not my style at all. But I did see a couple people order it.. so who am I to judge?  Also foodwise.. their burgers are bomb. I got the Hawaiian style burger it was, juicy, spicy amazingness."}
{"text":"One of my FAVORITE Craft Breweries in Arizona! They have an amazing kitchen menu and even better tap list! Service is always great! Whether you have a party of 10 or just you and another, they are always accommodating! Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"We have only been here one time and had good experience. The peanut butter burger paired well with our semi-fruity beer. It's a drive but we'll be back to try something else."}
{"text":"The one star is strictly for the girl that worked in the tap room this morning.  I love everting about Wilderness but today was the first bad experience I've had.  I went in to purchase their special release 4 pack.  This girl rang my beer up and said it was 21.56.  I handed her $25 and she gave me $3 back and walked away.  When I asked \"can I have the rest of my change back?\"  She very rudely replied, \"You want your .44 cents?\"  She then informed me that all they had were pennies.  When I asked \"why?\"  she said condescendingly \"Um...We'er a bar.\" Again, I love Wilderness.  The owners are fantastic.  But this employee was rude and I can't believe she's allowed to work there."}
{"text":"Met a local friend here based on his beer recommendations. Ended up chilling at the bar with their sampler variety of beer. It definitely has something for everyone, and while every style that they brew there may not be your type you'll probably want to try them all just to be sure.  Be sure to stop in on Caturday to check out the staff's variety of cat-themed shirts."}
{"text":"Great food, great brews, and very dog friendly! Their beer flights are the way to go, as they always have something delicious on rotation. The burgers are great, but my personal favorite is the black bean taco appetizer. They have a decent amount of vegetarian options here (especially for a brewery)."}
{"text":"Had a salad which was amazing and the duck fat fries. Was not expecting rosemary or floury cheese sauce.  Place was great, accommodating. Beer was very good.  Red headed hostess with the emerald engagement ring was the best"}
{"text":"Are you trying to find a brewery to call your home? Some place that is great for singles, couples and familes, including the kids?  Then look no further than Arizona Wilderness Brewery in Gilbert, Arizona. Not only do they have amazing brews, but their food is to die for.   From simple brew pub appetizers, such as the Red Pepper Hummus (add a chicken patty, suggested from one of their amazing bartenders Micah) to their delectable Pork Belly Sliders.  Or do you want a handcrafted burger, with 13 choices to choose from? I highly recommend their Apple & Brie Burger, the PB & Jalapeño Jelly Burger, Good Mornin' Burger and the Beet & Goat Cheese Burger. But trust me you don't have to take my word for it. Come down and try for yourself, these burgers will definitely blow your socks off.  Let's not forget about the amazing chicken and pork entrees they have at AZWBrewingCo. Absolutely love the Kater & Pork on Pork they have here. And my go to favorite, the Flyin' Belgian Pig (curious to know what that is? Come down and experience it yourself, you will not be disappointed)  But burgers, chicken & pork wouldn't be complete without the sides they have to select from. You have the normal, run of the mill side salad to a mouth-watering beet & apple salad. Then there's the fries (cooked in duck fat oil) to the mind blowing Belgian Waffle Onion Rings.  Now for the parents out there, your children have not been forgotten. They have a kids menu as well, and trust me if I was a child I'd be happy with any of the items they have on the kids menu.  Did I forget to mention the award winning brews here? They have 2 locations here at Arizona Wilderness Brewery to enjoy the brews. If you are just down for some brewski's, hang out in their tasting room. If you would like to enjoy the great brewski's and send you over the top food, ask for a table in the brew pub or enjoy the beautiful Arizona weather outside.  No matter where you decide to sit and enjoy locally grown food & locally handcrafted brews, Arizona Wilderness Brewery will never disappoint.  Many thanks to the unsung heroes of Arizona Wilderness Brewery for the great hospitality and for always treating me as part of the family. Thank you to Micah and Matt."}
{"text":"Great beer and amazing food. Wish Parking wasn't an issue but gives you an excuse to carpool or take an Uber!"}
{"text":"-Unfortunately can never return. Went out to Wilderness on a Friday night to catch up with some old friends and introduce them to Wilderness. My girlfriend and I took an Uber from chandler so we could relax and enjoy our night out. We got there before our friends arrived and put in for a table. While we were waiting we went for a beer in the tasting room. After I ordered my beer the bartender ID'D me, which was fine. But scrutinized my ID for a crack and said he won't take it. To clarify I'm an Arizona resident, 30 years old, full beard and the crack is minor. I also have multiple forms of state issued ID's that prove the ID is valid! Frustrated at this point, but we stayed and waited for our friends. After being seated and served in the restaurant we begin to relax. Then the arrogant douche of a bartender from the tasting room walks into the restaurant, makes eye contact with me, then goes straight to the sever and manager and a rats me out, are you kidding me! We were then told we could not be served! Very upset we left with our whole party and won't return.  -On another note while we are venting. This place has been become more pretentious and arrogant every time we come. You will also be criticized for not being a complete beer snob! Also do not ask if they serve wine or liquor or you will be shunned! This place is an outdoor themed brewery that feels like it's next step is moving to Scottsdale and adding a bouncer and dress code. I miss the early days of the Wilderness, and sadly will not be returning to what this place has become."}
{"text":"Don't even bother-apparently they do not provide parking for their clientele. After parking in what I thought was all one parking lot my car was towed and damaged. I had to wait 3 hours and spend $275 cash to get it back-what a racket!!! NO STARS!!! First and last time I go here"}
{"text":"Good place for the Arizona scene, however what terrible service and what a GREEDY business. I've literally been to hundreds of breweries and this place's nickel and dime customer service is the most draconian I've ever scene.  I walked in with a local friend who had talked very positively of their beers and the establishment. I asked if they had flights and the answer was yes, $8 for 5 beers. However it did not include the barrel aged ones. Also there were three beers on the menu that were not available. That left me with only 7 to choose from for the 5. I asked kindly if I could reduce my flight to 4 instead of 5 (still pay the full price) and do one of the barrel aged. NO. I then asked could I do two of one of the beers I had already selected, so still 5 beers, but two of the same. NO. I then said fine, i'll just do 4, but will stay pay full price but would like a very small tasting of the two barrel aged so I knew which one I would buy after the flight: NO.   At this point my friend who was a huge proponent of this place prior to arriving was even amazed and commented to our waitress Julie about how is this good customer service?  The hilarious (more sad) part of this is Julie comes back and says they could change the price of my flight from $8 to $13 and then I could include one Bourbon Aged beer. I asked how much was the same size pour of one of the Bourbon Aged beers and she said $5. So basically the option I was presented was MORE than if I would have included another 5th beer I didn't like and just ordered the Bourbon Aged straight up buy itself.  The management and staff obviously can't do math and does not care about craft beer. I've never been treated so terrible for a person who was a beer person and obviously wanted to talk/discuss, and try their good beers. It's not about the money, its about the principal.  Some business and staff get it, some don't. Sadly Arizona Wilderness Brewing just doesn't get it. They put nickels and dimes over good customer service and being nice.  I hope the rest of the Phoenix beer scene is better than this poorly run and customer disrespectful place."}
{"text":"YUM! We love this place. The fries are delish and I love the chicken club burger. I definitely do not like to share that one. They have a great selection on beer and a rotating tap, so drinks may change with time."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch including some beers there after a hike. Awesome place to sit outside. More than enough places on the day. Nice music at the background. However price-quality this house is not cheap. Especially some new beers (small glasses) were at the price. Fries with the burger and the sandwich were extra. Very frendly and expertized service."}
{"text":"Whatever they're doing, they're doing it right. They give San Tan Brewery and Four Peaks a run for their money. The atmosphere is spot on. It's a busy place but rightfully so. People love it. Grab a beer while you wait for a table. Beers are fun, interesting, and delicious!!!! This is thee best local brewery around! I'm ready for them to open up a location in Queen Creek!"}
{"text":"Great ambience, friendly service and awesome food. I don't drink alcohol but I'm sure this place has great drinks. I came for the food. Wife had a fruit and nut salad and really enjoyed it. I had 1 chicken taco and 1 pulled pork taco. Both very tasty. The cojita cheese made the tacos in my opinion. I also ordered a side of fries and liked them. We'll come back."}
{"text":"This is one of the few places my wife have been to more than once. We found it accidentally one Saturday afternoon and loved it. Great burgers and fries, even the ketchup is great. The beers we've tried have had a nice balance of being unique and also actually tasting good. The double IPA and Stout are probably our favorites."}
{"text":"I came here by myself off of the reviews of the food. Out here for work and wanted a good place to eat. Was instantly greeted and welcomed by the hostess marissa.  She was so friendly and made me feel at home.  Very friendly atmosphere thats not too in your face.  Just the right amount of hello.  The food,was incredible. A lot of there ingredients are local and very fresh.  So delicious. I left here so elated and will definitely come back when I'm out here for work. Would Absolutley recommend"}
{"text":"I came after being told this establishment had received \"Best New Brewery in the World\". Let me tell you, it must have been a god awful year for breweries. I had the IPA and the Danish Redneck. They were exceptionally mediocre. My companions ordered Gibraltar Goss (Grapefruit), it tasted like nachos. Shit you not. How in the holy hell does a grapefruit beer taste like nachos? That is some ungodly evil brewmaster dealings. A random man wandering the woods could pillage the ingredients to make better beers than this overhyped atrocity."}
{"text":"Came here on a trip through the Phoenix (1 of about 6 breweries we tried). I had high expectations from this place based on word of mouth and seeing their reviews.   We had the flying belgian pig in beer cheese (beer cheese and pork covered fries). The Fries were a little on the burned side, the pork was tender but not full of flavor, and the beer cheese was almost non-existent. The size of the dish was great, but the amount of cheese covered *maybe* 20% of the fries. Once you picked through the top layer, you were left with dry, overcooked fries with no cheese. Kind of disappointing.   We also had a flight of all their beers on tap, which included the Little Guy Rye, Saddle Mountain Saison, Superstition Coffee Stout, and the Chiricahua Common (they had just blown one of the kegs so there were only 4 options available at the time. This isn't a bad since that happens all the time and I get it, just a note as to why I only tried 4). I didn't hate any of them, but I also didn't love any. I love sours and the Chiricahua Common was one of the most unique/funky/interesting beers I've ever had. There were many flavors present, but I felt like they were competing with each other rather than complementing each other. Just something a little \"off\" to me, hard to put into words. The Superstition was my favorite of the bunch...if it was a little more viscous and maybe a little more heavy on the coffee flavor, I would have loved it. Overall a solid beer, but fell just a little short for me.   I can't say the brewrey lived up to the expectations I had, but then again it wasn't a bad experience at all."}
{"text":"Where do I begin...service was ok... Beer avg. food sucked except the confit wings.. wich were legs not wings.. really wanted to like it but growing up in the northwest knowing micro brew had me thinking amateur at best... No ambiance.. strip mall ..hipster service...  I won't be back. So much hype wilderness is my definition of underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for lunch with a Friend or friends ! The place is slightly loud but that just means the place is hopping and peeps are having a good time ."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the beer, since I don't drink, but my husband got a flight that he really enjoyed, and the price was super reasonable, especially compared to where we live - Southwest Florida.  The food selections are so good!! Love that you can get a grass-fed patty, love that the fries are cooked in duck fat oil... choices that are much better for you than the conventional. Plus, there are great flavor combinations on the several different burger options. I had the Hawaiian, my husband the beer&bleu, and our friends, the apple&brie and the mushroom&beer cheese... they were all so good. Oh, and the fries - delish!  Ambiance is great. Decor is cool. Staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  We would be here often if we lived here. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place is still great. Right now they have a pistachio double IPA that is just insanely good. Of course I have to mention the amazing duck fat fries.... just can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Beer is solid.  Wish they would establish a few mainstays and then tinker with the rotating R&D beers.  You never know what you are going to get.  Gotta give Em credit though.  They make a consistent effort to use local ingredients and from the looks of their Instagram account they have a ton of fun doing it.    The food seems a tad overpriced for what you get.  I would rate the food average.  Nothing to write home about.  Overall though this place has a good vibe especially since they have expanded and grew the outside patio.  I'd go back.  Especially to see what they are brewing up next."}
{"text":"Great beers, terrible food.  My cousin ordered the pulled pork.  It eventually came and was just a huge chunk of gristle.  One big, translucent chunk of gristle.  Couldn't cut it with the standard dull dinner knife.  There was no meat.  We passed it around the table and joked about it.  We sat for 15 minutes or so waiting for his replacement meal.  But we gave up and ate ours cold.  His eventually came and we... watched him eat.  I'd been here for beers before, but I don't go out for just beers anymore.  I go for food and a single beer or a sampler.  This place was hyped up for months before it opened and was already winning awards.  But it sucks.  So much BS like this around the valley surrounding places like these.  Patting each other on the backs undeservedly."}
{"text":"10 months ago we visited Arizona Wilderness Brewing Co. The food was memorable, as well as, the drinks. My wife and I decided to revisit Arizona Wilderness Brewing Co. (AWBC) for lunch. I had the Beer Bacon 'N' Blue Burger ($11.29) then I upgraded my patty to the local grass fed for $3.00, I believe. Upon my first bite, I was taken back! The flavors were remarkable! Blue Cheese was not over-powering and the bacon was tasteful. The choice of arugula complemented the cheese, lightly grilled buns, and added the right texture to the patty. Which, was moist, tender, and coupled by a natural sweetness that showcased the of quality beef. On the side were AWBC's house made chips. For my pallet, they were perfectly salted, enjoyably crisp, and not burned. I was pleasantly happy with the quantity and quality of food during this visit. I topped off my visit with a tasting of AWBC's Tres Alamos Tripel. It is a Belgian Tripel, which, humbly boasts of it's 9.4% ABV. Layered in complex and pleasant flavors, such as, pears, bananas, and spices. This is a must try for those seeking more from a beer than filling. Last but not least, our service was exceptional! Meagan was outstanding. Great visit and I hope everyone has a similar experience."}
{"text":"We visited the tasting room and loved it! The tasting room is a lot less busier than the restaurant so definitely take this route if you're just going for drinks like we did (there is no line/wait). My favorite was the Refuge IPA (their most popular beer). The only downside was the cost to fill up our growler... $25 for 60 some odd ounces seems high, even for craft beer. Looking forward to trying the food next time. ****4 Stars."}
{"text":"This one star review is primarily because AZ Wilderness shows up 1st in my vegetarian search. This is the least veggie friendly restaurant I've ever been to. I would give the staff a 1 star review also. They are more concerned with grooming their beards than checking for water and beer refills. The beer is hit and miss. I've had some decent beers, I've also had some less desirable beers. All of my carnivorous friends love this place so I end up here more than I'd like. Please offer more veggie options. Black bean burgers get old. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I don't quite know what happened. My husband and I went on a Saturday and were slightly disappointed. Confused at where we check in to get a table, we walked into the tasting room instead. Stood around looking silly because we had no idea where the hostess was. Once we finally went up to the bar, we asked where to go. Going into the resteraunt we were seated at a high-top. After sitting down it took a while for the server to show up. Once she finally did we placed our order. The beer and food took a while to come for some reason. Once it finally came, we tasted a little of everything. The artichoke dip had a layer of cheese on the top that I could not break apart. It was literally a thin layer of hardened cheese. The waffle onion rings were good however they forgot my sauce. I had to wait around my my server to finally come back and ask for it. We literally had to flag our server down on a few occasions just to get what we needed. Service was severely lacking and made for a mediocre experience overall. It was my husbands birthday but we didn't even bother ordering desert due to the amount of time everything took."}
{"text":"Beer: The IPA was just okay, while the double IPA was definitely better. I have had a few more, like their rye, and their beer is not bad. However, I do notice that there is not much consistency from visit to visit, as far as what the IPA will taste like or what beers will be available. As far as being the most \"intensely flavored\" beers in the Valley, as claimed by another reviewer, I would have to disagree. This place is nowhere near that right now. That is not to say that they cannot grow into something special, but as of right now, they still need to work on consistency.   Food: Burgers. Burgers. More burgers. If you are not in the mood for a burger, you have a few appetizers to pick from. We opted for the fries (claimed to be in the Belgian style, fried in duck fat) and their artichoke dip... Both were not very good... The fries.... Look.... I have been to Belgium multiple times, specifically for beer and food. These fries are not Belgian in any way, shape or form. These fries were overcooked, and they season them with dried rosemary and thyme. Like, a LOT of rosemary and thyme. Who in their right mind would want to eat overcooked fries with dried twigs sprinkled liberally throughout? It was a greasy, overcooked, twiggy mess. Complete bullocks.   The artichoke dip, also bullocks. It came in a disposable cup, and based upon how it was cooked, and the temperature differences throughout the dish, I am pretty sure it was microwaved. It also had a very milky taste, and did not seem like a dip, but rather a collection of a few ill-thought ingredients that were not properly sealed together.    Overall, this menu is just bad, in my opinion. Perhaps I will return eventually and try a burger, but I will certainly not trust the appetizers ever again. The beer is not terrible, but certainly not anything special. If I do return, it will be in like a year, to see if they have made improvements.  I hate to give a local joint a bad review, but I just did not like it here that much."}
{"text":"Bummer Wilderness for your regular customers.  Too many hipsters has made the wait an hour or more on Saturday night.  Running out of a lot of beer selections.  Maybe it will help when you finish the new addition from the bagel shop.  We'll try again, but sad that the locals lose out."}
{"text":"I've only had the beer here. When I stopped by to pick up some cans of White Canyon Blonde Stout, the food smelled really good and the menu looked inspired, so I'll have to come back for the food.  This review is based on the beer. It is fantastic. I've never had a blonde stout before, and this one is light and refreshing. Not too heavy and I can really taste the coffee and cacao."}
{"text":"Great service provided by Kayla, our server, and Kirsten, the hostess! The two girls were very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. There is usually a crowd but we always get seated pretty quickly. Definitely one of my favorite brewery's!"}
{"text":"Great place! We had the jalapeño jelly peanut butter  burger (I know, sounds weird) but it was delicious. The local brews were awesome too and the place is dog friendly! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If this is your first time here... definitely get the flight of beers, and go by your waiters recommendation of which to start first.  Every beer gets better and better. I've never had such a good experience meeting a great staff with such passion for greatly made beer.  This makes me want to move back to the Valley just for this Brewery!"}
{"text":"This place was outstanding!! Really cool ambiencre! You gotta have those delicious wings! I ordered a flight of beer and the IPA and the stout were my favorites :)"}
{"text":"Seems like a cool place.  I enjoyed the IPA refuge and the sour. Not everyone offers a sour. I'm super impressed with the availability of a sour. Most breweries don't include one due to the amount of time for production. The sour apple was tart and the grape sour was pleasantly light and refreshing.  As for taco Tuesday, my order was great. Pork tacos (served hot)  and squash taco (luke warm) . I was disappointed with the habanero salsa being pickled but they have saracha.  I love the story of the birth of wilderness and I love the logo. Nice job, fellas. Enjoy the success!   Oh, and try the juniper Mesa dark. Unique. Something to appreciate from an adventurous  brew pub."}
{"text":"Great locally sourced ingredients for beer and food.  The craft is strong here.  Nice pub-style atmosphere, friendly service always.  The pork on pork sandwich rocks.  Love the farmhouse ales and sours.  Highly recommended for lunch or whenever you have to have fresh, high quality craft beverage."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always has great food, beer, music, and service. This is one of our go to spots!"}
{"text":"Order the duck fries covered in green chili pork and beer cheese and you can come thank me later. The absolute best food to just pig out on! Their sour ale is also on point. I dig the vibe and the people working there were energetic and really nice. Definitely will be coming back as often as I can!"}
{"text":"Super good food and beer. Simple and direct. Not much more I can say. Greasy yummy bar food"}
{"text":"Typical bar and grill food is done well. Beer is local but I did not think it to be spectacular. Tried the beer flight and none stood out. Restaurant feels a little disorganized. Have visited twice and neither time was impressed."}
{"text":"Main Points: -One of the few southeast valley breweries -Excellent service -Good variety of beer  Review: Being a fan of craft beer, I decided I needed to finally try this local brewery, and I'm glad I did!  I wasn't sure if I was even going to get seating, because the place appeared to be at max capacity (the World Cup Final had just concluded, and the fans were famished), but I was promptly seated.   I didn't get a chance to try any food off the menu, as I was specifically there for the liquid bread.  That said, I ordered the extended flight which included all 7 of their currently tapped brews.  All were high quality beers, some of which were very unique such as smoked saison or the peach porter, made with locally grown peaches!  Throughout the visit, our water glasses stayed full and our drink orders were fulfilled swiftly.  I give AZ Wilderness a 5 because I like the unique variety, convenient location, excellent service & friendly staff, and the fact that they continuously come out with new beer keeping us in anticipation. The one downside is the noise level due to the concrete floors and walls, but I'm looking forward to trying the food next time and their latest beer creation."}
{"text":"Very interesting.   I came here on a Friday night post dinner to grab some drinks with my fellow amateur beer connoisseurs, therefore did not try much on the menu, though I did notice many dishes I would come back to try, but when I do return it will not be for the beer.   While I would like to think that I am a beer drinker who is open to trying a variety of brews, I left here wishing I hadn't.  My husband and I dove right in and got the flight since we were not familiar with any of their beers, but even while looking at the list noticed they all seemed to blur together in regard to flavors, descriptions, and IBUs.  I'm not sure if this is a common occurrence, or just something we happened to experience while visiting here, but their lack of variety really turned me off.    While finishing the beer our group got hungry and decided to try their spicy hummus, which was the highlight of our visit!  Very tasty and perfectly spicy, plus I loved that they include a mix of pita and cucumber and top it off with Sriracha, can't go wrong there!   My tip for prospective visitors: go here if you like a hipster ambiance, hoppy beer, and above par bar food.  My tip for wilderness:  offer a more well rounded selection of brews, and create a more concise and visual description of your beers"}
{"text":"I have really enjoyed Wilderness.   Firstly, my experience has been that the wait staff is top-notch here. I'd say never a complaint, but they constantly exceed expectations, so I feel that would be a slap in the face to just say \"no complaints.\"  The beers are excellent. They have fun names, there is a wide selection of beers brewed in-house, and there are some fun variations such as adding in a splash of coconut water to the Dirty Water #9 to give it a new dimension and freshen things up more for a hot day.  The food is generally good. I love the appetizers mostly. The o-rings, fries, and pretzel sticks are each pretty amazing options. They also do a pork rib with a tasty rub built out into a \"pop\" that is cool and delicious. The burgers are a main feature for many, but that's been the worst thing for me the times I have tried. Buns are uneventful and the bottom one has usually been soggy. I've found the burger is stacked too high to eat, so you either gnaw at it like a child to an apple or drop toppings or bun ... or just go at it with a knife and fork. The patty itself and most toppings are delicious, don't get me wrong. It's just not a real great experience getting that mountain of yum into my belly.  And, the dining room and outdoor seating is all great! They have a separate tap room for those on a more specific mission. Some nights can be a little hairy due to its popularity, so first-timers may wish to try a weekday lunch or something to avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"If you come here for dinner, you'll want to get seated right after you have lunch because it'll take you that long to get served.  And I hope you like your burgers bloody.....  Hands down the worst service ever!"}
{"text":"Ignore any bad reviews of this place. The beers are awesome, the food is AMAZING, and the place itself is pretty cool. There is usually always a long wait but you can't fault a place for being popular. I went there with my friends and we kept eating each other's burgers trying to decide who's was the best and they all were sooooooooo good!"}
{"text":"What a fun place to go!!!   Had a great time here and would defiantly recommend it to all!!"}
{"text":"The beer and food here is great! So great that I gave it 2 chances. But each time I've come here the hostesses and waitresses have been so rude I will not return. They all have an attitude that is completely off putting. A real shame since we love their beer."}
{"text":"PROS: Great patio seating, Refuge IPA, chicken confit wings, breakfast burger, chill atmosphere.   CONS: No longer on No Wait app, crappy parking, long waits, spotty service...can be a little hit or miss.  I have been to AZ Wilderness for lunch and dinner, with my SO and in a large group. I think they are expanding the restaurant. This was on a list for my Check, Please AZ segment and we really liked the beet burger and fries. My go to are the pork belly sliders and chicken confit wings with blue cheese dipping sauce. We like taking our friends from out of town and it's a fun brewery and is closer to us than Four Peaks. Tasty food and beer, can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Not terribly impressed with the food (the pretzel is great but I've had the chicken burger and salad and it was eh). It's very loud and the service is spotty (we had terrible service at the bar and a great server at a table). Only going back for good releases but we'll definitly eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was told by my Arizona friends that this place is currently ranked the best new craft brewery in America. Being from San Diego, where the craft brewing scene is huge, I have pretty high standards. That being said, this place definitely met my expectations.   I decided to order tasters of everything and here some of the things worth mentioning:  * If you enjoy the hops as much as I do, go for the Refuge IPA. It was perfectly hoppy, which made it my favorite beer of the night.  * Another great choice is the Suit-n-tIePA (double IPA). It's weird that it's not quite as hoppy as the Refuge IPA, but no doubt still an excellent beer. It's hard to believe it 8.2% alcohol considering how smooth it is. * I'm not a fan of sour beers, but I know some people are. I tried the BW Berliner Weisse and Sour in the Redfield and they were just not good in my opinion.  * The Signal Mountain Stout surprised me. I am not big on stouts, but it was good because it's not too heavy and you can actually taste the cacoa in it.   I also ordered the Hawaiian Wilderness burger (Brisket Blend Burger, Pepper Jack Cheese, Beeriyaki Grilled Pineapple, Beer-Braised Onions, Sweet 'N' Spicy (Brioche)) and it was very good. I would consider myself a harsh burger critic, so I do have a few comments. The meat was a TINY bit overcooked, but the middle of the burger was good. I ordered the Sweet 'N' Spicy sauce on the side since the waitress told me it would be more on the spicy side. I still gave it a try, but I wasn't a fan since I'm not really into spicy food. My friend on the other hand, ordered the same thing and really enjoyed the sauce so it really just depends on what you prefer. My favorite part of the burger was the Beer-Braised Onions. I could eat those every day!    Overall, I really enjoyed this brewery a lot. When it comes to beer, they have something for everyone (and they are inexpensive too). The food is mostly burgers but there are a few other options if you're not into that (I really want to try the Bavarian Pretzel Sticks sometime). Go early because they get VERY busy and the wait can be long. OR, you can go around 8 pm like we did when the dinner rush is over. We still had to wait 15-20 minutes to get seated but we just stood in the bar area and started trying beers. If you go around 6-7 pm, I hear the wait can be an hour or longer!"}
{"text":"Had a great time with my family, food was good and the beer was great. Went for lunch and one thing that would have made this experience better would be if they weren't blaring music, I'm in my mid 20s and our party of four were constantly asking to repeat what we said. But other than that we will definetly like to come back in the near future!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love AZ Wilderness Brewing Company. The After the Hike Burger is my go to. And duck fat fries are indescribably awesome. I have been here 4 times now and it has been consistently outstanding. I really enjoy their rotating beer menu too. Hands down, my favorites so far have been the Abbey Dubbel and the Triple IPA."}
{"text":"Easy 5 star place. Great beer (all local) and the food is amazing. They use tons of local fresh ingredients to keep on with that Arizona strong theme. Highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Cool concept, very poor execution.  Nice job making an effort to offer unique brews. However, not everyone is trying to go on an adventure with weird flavors or induce sleep from heavy beers. The tap selection needs to be broadened. And if a place is only going to offer 5 or 6 taps, then it might be a good idea to brew enough so that 2 or 3 of the taps arent empty in the afternoon.  The food again is trying to be creative but falling flat, instead of sticking to classic pub food & doing that well. It's a menu full of food that could be good, but instead is modified unnecessarily, then prepared poorly & presented to you like slop in a basket.   The service was also subpar and made me wish I was a bad tipper.   Meh, just one more reason to stay out of Gilbert."}
{"text":"Ordered well done burger; came out rare to medium rare. The chicken was tough couldn't eat it."}
{"text":"Great burgers, staff is well informed and able to give the perfect recommendations on what you should try!"}
{"text":"Sublime! This is by fast the best burger and beer in Arizona. Im in love with a burger joint!"}
{"text":"Came in here around 4 with my dad at first the place is a little confusing as you are greeted and sat by an outdoor hostess but I'm assuming that has to do with their theme of the place. The place has a super laid back atmosphere with some nice outdoor seating. Our server was very informative when we asked about the beers being brewed he seemed passionate about the foods and beers they made there. We ordered whatever he said was most popular and we were very impressed! Everything was very yummy and decently priced as well . It's a bit of a drive for me but I will be back again when I have the chance for sure!"}
{"text":"Great food and beer. Had the After a Hike burger and it was delicious and huge. Upgraded to the local beef and fries which I recommend both. Only downside was with upgrades the burger and fries came to $20. A little pricey. Overall a nice brewery."}
{"text":"Coffee stout here is my favorite, already filled growler 3 times in 2 weeks. Duck fat fries with rosemary and thyme, amazing. Staff is friendly, accommodating and passionate about the product. Took my niece and nephew here and enjoyed a drink together. My husband and nephew are fellow beards and felt at home in the wilderness."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place a lot when it first opened and you could actually get in and find a seat at the bar or get a table. Burgers are solid and beer is good too. They offer quite an array of different styles and what I really appreciate most is the fact that they use local ingredients and brew the not so consumed styles like sours, quads, and rye. I have not been here since 2014 so I'm sure a lot has changed. Every time I drive by it's standing room only with a long line outside. They must be doing something right."}
{"text":"This place is the best new brewery in the Phoenix area. Great food and beers. Their signal stout on nitro is awesome!"}
{"text":"Good food, great beers...just an awesome place!!  Will keep coming back and would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"First visit and probably our last, not really a bad experience just not enough to go out of our way. The server was helpful with the menu and beer selection but the food was just ok. The good morning burger was great but everything else was pretty average. The ambiance was very loud which is fine, just keep that in mind. Bottom line, for our money, and the bill added up quick, we're going back to Four Peaks."}
{"text":"Yay Wilderness! Let me count the ways I came to love you.  Pleasant, affable service and conversation with the beermongers. And yeah, the other Yelpers have a point: there's some well-groomed dudes walking around. I mean that in a less-creepy way, I promise.  Burgers with toppings that almost make you cut it up to catch a bit in every bite. A range of choices of patty and add-ons and breads. A commitment to beer in the cuisine as well as the drinks. Mmmm beeriyaki pineapple.   Pretzels and beer cheese that made my Bavarian heart weep. Served hot, hot, hot and paired with mustard that actually looks and tastes like mustard seeds rather than tumeric paste. I didn't love the chips but evidently the fries are wonderful.  Comfortable outdoor and indoor seating and nicely kept bathrooms.   Oh yes. The beer. Grapefruit gose, my heart. Coffee stout, you dark temptress. Juniper Dark Ale with your secret flavors. And Sour red, what a saucy wench."}
{"text":"Such a great place to enjoy some local brew and food. Well done Arizona Wilderness. Jasmine was also an excellent server for our visit. I'd recommend this place for sure! 5 Stars all the way"}
{"text":"I used to work across the street and frequented here. Great beer selection and the staff are very helpful - honestly this place is always busy and the  service doesn't suffer, I don't know how they do it. The food is great, the duck fat fries are dangerously good. The best thing I'd recommend would be to pre-order your food and have a beer while you wait.   Great burgers also, for the price/taste it's a steal."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers.  Their beer cheese is to die for, get some extra to dip your fries in.  Great beers, Refuge IPA is my hands-down favorite of theirs.  Gets pretty busy, so expect a wait."}
{"text":"I don't drink yet the food is worth a revisit alone. I imagine the craft brews would also be on par."}
{"text":"Great beer. Great bar service. Sucky service (ridiculous and unnecessary wait). These folks need to figure out how to run a restaurant. Three empty tables but host said wait was over an hour - didn't want to seat people because trying to go easier on the kitchen. WHAT???????  This is not the way to grow a business."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite brewery in the Phoenix area. This place is awesome!  They have a wide selection of sour beers, which is a rare treat. All the food is great. Plenty of seating and a great atmosphere. You must come here!"}
{"text":"Since I am not a beer drinker but was with beer experts they say the beer was wonderful!  We heard the fries were amazing so ordered those with our burgers.  My daughter and I decided to get different burgers and split them so we could try both kinds.  We got the Bleu cheese and the mushroom with beer cheese.   Meh.... If there was cheese on either one of them it was not apparent on our burgers.  The fries were OK....and I say that because they come heavily sprinkled with rosemary which I do not like at all.  The atmosphere was enjoyable and the staff attentive.  I probably won't be back anytime soon.  Hubby might go back to fill up his growler but the food,  didn't get me too excited to come back."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my favorite breweries to visit! You get to escape the chaos of the city and enjoy some delicious food and a cold one!   A few reasons why I will continue to rave about this place: brew, food, ambience and service! The food is unique and very savory! It's not your typical bar food. The beer is amazing and I have to ask my husband to refrain from ordering too much!   One thing that continues to surprise me is the amazing service! Every time I have come to visit they are quick to seat, serve and feed! Before I finish half of my beer the appetizer dish is already out!   If you can visit you must try the chicken drumsticks with your choice of dipping sauce, the peanut butter jelly burger and the grilled cheese! The drumsticks are seasoned perfectly! The meat is so tender and it can barely stay on the bone! I'm usually one for a burger with sunny side egg or Brie and apples but the jalapeño jelly and peanut butter burger is by far my fav! Never would have thought the combination would be so perfect! The grilled cheese was also my favorite - all the flavors go together so well! You won't be let down!   Try it out! Bring your dog! This place is so welcoming, you won't want to leave!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I've been going there since the first day and opened and I'll never stop. The staff treats us like family and always knows what I want to drink and of course the beer is absolutely amazing.The food is delicious and I'm a vegetarian so it's very nice to have so many options on a menu. The flavors are unique and locally-sourced which is a big deal to me. Anytime we have family come in from out of town, we take them there for dinner and they're always impressed. A few of them purposely come to visit just so they can go to Wilderness. If you haven't gone there, you're seriously missing out. It's one of my top 3 places in Arizona."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is quite good. The service was really slow and detracted from our experience. It was particularly annoying to pay extra to upgrade to fries to get a tiny portion that looked like an after thought. If your going to charge extra for something you'd think they would make an effort to at least pretend that you are actually getting something extra. On the other hand, $10 for a beer flight was a pretty good value. With a little effort this could easily be a four star place."}
{"text":"Food here is amazing as well as the beer. Everyday they have a different special of the day. Their Tacos on Tuesdays are spectacular. I just wish they had more room to keep the wait times low."}
{"text":"I get tired of the same ole burgers.....bacon, double, single, special sauce, and all over cooked.  You have the option of ordering well or pink, we ordered pink thinking they would be just under well done...nope, just the right amount of pink.  I personally love all the different options of burgers... I had the AZ Trail Burger and loved it, can't wait to something else."}
{"text":"Pretty good beer here, though most of their IPA and hoppy beers are somewhat lacking and leave you with and overall \"eh\" feeling.  The food is good and definitely better than what you find in most breweries in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The first two things that I would teleport to my face right now if i had the technology would be a frosty growler of ultra dank beer from wilderness and two orders of crispy pork belly sliders on buttered and salty pretzel rolls."}
{"text":"This place is Killing it! My wife and I stopped for dinner and our experience was off the charts! The craft beer, the burgers, the staff All was by far the best that anyone could ask for.  The GM Justus was invested in our experience and insured everything was to our expectations. Job well done! We will be back with family and friends."}
{"text":"Waitress was friendly food was pretty good I paid the upgrade price for onion rings apparently for the extra couple dollars you only get 4 onion rings that seemed a little ridiculous. Was good enough that I will definitely give it a second chance."}
{"text":"Just came here for the first time for lunch during a work day. Had just a plain cheeseburger with chips and it was delicious. The chips were by far the best part. Huge cut chips, tasty. I wish I had gone with something a little more risky on the burger because they had some pretty interesting options, maybe next time.  The staff was also super friendly and attentive and they got us in and out quick which is appreciative when you're working. Great place and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I really loved this place! It might very well be my first true brewery type experience outside of just having a lot of rotating taps. I sat at the bar and to the left of me was someone who needed to leave two glass ago and thankfully they did not stay long. To the right someone came in later who seemed to be as serious as I was exploring the tastes.  Yes, they have flights which count five beers and that is a lot but still does not cover their total selection by far. When I was super pleased and done with that round there were still a couple I wanted to try but did not want another 5 glasses to deal with and thankfully you can simply buy them one up as well. Thus a 7 total tastes for me. Favorites are generally a personal choice so I am not going to get into the picks here.  I also the beet and goat burger upgraded to local beef and the duck fat fries. I was super happy with the food as well so overall this place is a true hit. The best part being the people behind the bar (and I assume in the general seating area too) can tell you the stories behind the beer crafting as well."}
{"text":"Loved the food and loved the service. First time here I had the PB&J burger. Was hesitant to try it but DEF recommend! Fries are great, people are nice, Beer is amazing, nothing but good vibes here."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!  All of our food was exquisite.  The peanut butter and jalapeño jelly burger was delicious and subtle.  The local grass fed beef was well worth the extra money!! The Belgium waffle battered onion rings were the best onion rings ever, especially with the sirachi maple syrup ketchup.  Adding to unique food experiences, try the grilled jalapeño popper sandwich with duck fat fries... oh my!!! When trying the restaurant be sure to ask for Bryce, he was a delightful and attentive server. The brew was the best we've tried in the area as well."}
{"text":"People love this place. So much so, that if you come during the weekend they have a looong wait (like 2 hours). Luckily, if you only want beer you can go get some in their tasting room. The husband and I split a flight. I wanted to try the sours and he tried a saison and an ipa. Unfortunately, we didn't like any of the beers..... I know! And I love sours typically! Maybe it's just me, but this place was a strike out. Sorry AZ wilderness..."}
{"text":"Do the flight of everything on draft for the day.  I met the owners (amazing guys).  Amazing beer, amazing food .. Highly recommend.  Come for a tapping on Saturday!  Talk to the locals."}
{"text":"Yay to trying another brewery!! A lot of my fellow Yelpers gave such great reviews for this place so I had really high hopes and wanted to try it out.    I ordered the good morning burger. This comes with cheese, bacon, egg over medium, roasted red peppers and onions. It also comes on a pretzel bun. It was really messy! Then again anything with an egg on it will be. Lol. I would've liked it better with an over easy egg. I felt it was also a bit dry and could've used some type of sauce in the burger. The pretzel bun must be their specialty because most of their burgers have this option which is a good idea.   For the beer I ordered the peanut brittle beer. It was amazing! It literally tasted like peanut brittle! I really wanted to try the pecan pie ale that Joyce mentioned in her review but it wasn't on tap.   I felt that for a brewery they should've had a bigger selection. There's only about 8 beers on tap. I didn't get to try the pecan pie and that amazing peanut brittle probably won't be there next time I come in. It's also a bit loud in there for my taste."}
{"text":"I came here after a long day working in the hot and dusty Arizona desert. I'd heard they produced the worlds best beer, that they beat even the Belgians! shit...anybody who beats up a Belgian is my friend for life.The place was packed but I was greeted immediately by the FRIENDLY Staff (CAPITALIZED because they have to YELL). I asked for a dark ale but was given a Coffee flavored Stout. It was that or an IPA- I hate IPA's more than Belgians and Germans, and Yankees, especially theim damn Yankees.   The ale was good but I'm not a coffee fan. I didn't want to try all 10 of the beers on tap since I needed to drive back to my hotel. But I do recommend Arizona Wilderness for the very friendly and knowledgeable Staff, the clean restaurant, clean bathrooms, and the food is pretty good as well. I had a burger with cheese and bbq sauce that hit the spot along with the beer.Fries were fresh and salty and not overcooked.    I'm roaming the Arizona desert in hopes of finding more home-grown, cold beer."}
{"text":"Back to Arizona Wilderness and it gets better!   Best beer being brewed in the Valley right now.  Food, tremendous ... Service, attentive. If you're coming here for spring training get here for the top beer in Phoenix .. Then leave so I can get a table."}
{"text":"Been back around 7 or 8 times since the grand opening. The beers just keep getting better and better.   Big guy Rye is amazing upgrade to the little guy Rye. The Bear wallow Berliner weisse is also an amazing beer. Nobody else brews a beer like it in the valley.  The enkel is one of my new favorite beers and I cannot get enough of it.   They will be tapping their Pecan pie porter on Halloween day.  This is a very highly anticipated beer they will be releasing. I don't think it will last more than a week. If you read this review prior to Halloween be sure to get here to try out this upcoming amazing beer."}
{"text":"Really tasty beers, cool environment, and one of the best burgers around. The siracha ketchup is a must add for your burger."}
{"text":"Food is good, mostly burgers. Great pork with green chili! Pretzel buns... HELLO! So good!"}
{"text":"Beer was pretty good.  Don't go with a large group. Poor ability to determine how long it will take to get a table, and limited large group space. I like that they are willing to take risks on their beers, which can mean really good things, but also poorly constructed and imbalanced beers.  Worth a try, but just be aware it's not running the mill flavor profile-wise.  Nice service otherwise."}
{"text":"Well, first and probably last visit here. We love craft beer and good food so decided to try this place out for lunch today. Kind of odd the hostess station is outside in sun and heat. Not as big inside as it looks but there is a tasting room we did not enter. It was loud due to lack of sound absorbing materials. We had to ask for condiments, salt & pepper and silverware/napkins, which ended up being plastic ware and food is served in baskets. Our server was friendly and efficient. We ordered the beer sampler, 5 for $8 and honestly only one was just ok (Santa Teresa) the rest had funky after tastes or just were bad (Table Top Saison, Salt River Saison, Pusche Ridge Porter, Red Rock Secret). We split a burger with onion rings. The 'brisket' blend beef was bland and for the $1.50 up charge we got 4 onion rings. The pretzel bun was just wrong, too much bread and possibly stale, yuk. This place is just a fail in my book. See you at San Tan Brewing."}
{"text":"The burgers are fantastic. The fries out of this world. Great beer. Our server was newer but he was excited about the food and beer and all of his recommendations were spot on. We love to eat out and we have some favorite burger spots but this restaurant has set a high bar that will be hard to beat.  Creativity and risk but it works both in the beer and the food.  Peanut butter and jalapeño jelly burger is a great example of what I am talking about.  The beer had equal uniqueness.  The sad part is we live in Indiana, still we hope to go back."}
{"text":"Definitely a gem, maybe not so hidden anymore, but it's location makes it feel as such nonetheless. I've been a couple times now and it never disappoints. The Wilderness fries are a staple, and I recommend getting one of the four options to anyone.   The beer selection is diverse enough that you should be covered no matter the style you enjoy most. My girlfriend and I don't care for IPA's much, but unlike like other breweries the quality doesn't fall off for non-IPA's. The Simply Sorachi is my go to. It is ultra smooth, not too hoppy for my liking, while still holding a great flavor.   The one downside is the lack of TVs for anyone looking to go and watch a sporting event. I went last night to watch a game and to my dismay I forgot there are only two TVs up at the bar. The other two, even larger TVs, are reserved for a scenic slideshow. When asked if those could be changed, I was told they are just for the slideshow. That being said our server was super friendly and made it a point to periodically check if any seats opened up at the bar for us to move.  Give this brewery a shot, it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Really nice little place.  Staff is SUPER friendly. Impressive variety of beer styles given the volume of the brewery.  Dry- rubbed chicken wings were a great app."}
{"text":"This place feels like \"Cheers\"! (You know, the place where everybody knows your name :)  The beer is PHENOMENAL! They use quite a few local ingredients in their brewing process. Food is pretty great as well. The menu is nice and simple and they usually have some kind of daily special. This is our new Sunday afternoon spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing awesome beer with lots of beards roaming around. Great vibes, great good,  with exceptional service. I love the saison they have everyone once in awhile, I highly recommend getting it if they have it on tap. First time here I grabbed the az trail burger. Very tasty!  Get the Home made chips or the fries, neither are disappointing. I get growlers on a regular basis. I love the atmosphere here. Loud inside and very peaceful on the patio, I like both! Second time here got the duck fat fries smothered with pulled pork and beer cheese, and the meatloaf sliders. Both were very delicious, but the pulled pork fries(forgetting what they are really called).... Specifically the pork, lacked in flavor and was a bit water logged. Seems like the fries and beer cheese made up for the flavor of the dish. They just need to season it a lot more or marinade it..... I give this place 5 stars anyway. Because I just can't get enough"}
{"text":"This place is great! Went on a Sunday, which is Happy Hour all day! The atmosphere is urban rustic, casual with very friendly and prompt service. Our table ordered the spicy black bean tacos and chicken quesadillas. Both were amazing! The beers were also tasty  --we loved that they were all local!!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH!! SO SO GOOD!  What a fun looking restaurant and the beer and food is great!  We have been several times and are in love.  So great.  Seriously, do yourself a favor and try this place out!  They have a chicken sandwich with a green chile, it literally is my favorite sandwich from any place we eat at."}
{"text":"Loving their IPAs! And the blood orange gose we tried was unique (to us at least) and tasty. The vibe was great, catered to all age groups. So glad to find another awesome, dog friendly patio! I was less impressed with their selection for vegans/vegetarians.... there was a veggie burger and some salads I could've tried but eh... I was able to ask for the French fries with out duck fat (ew) which was nice! Also, thought their growler fill prices were a bit much... but everybody's gotta make a living I guess."}
{"text":"Great food, Great beer, their servers and bartenders are all amazing and always smiling....I always order the jalapeño sliders and a salad but reading everyone's post the next must have is the duck fat fries lol Oh and they finally have a patio! Need I say more"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites. Beer is super delicious, food is superb, and the staff is always nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Went back a few days ago and loved it even more. Delicious 50/50 brisket burger and fries cooked in dick fat with rosemary?? Be still my slow beating heart. They were completely out of the imperial stout which I really really wanted so that was a huge bummer. Came with friends and we got to sit outside at an awesome picnic table. The renovations that they did were awesome--I love all the wood signs. Unfortunately I had to leave at some point but I took some coffee stout (my favorite) home in a growler, bought a shirt and a sticker and I'm gonna rep Wilderness in StL!"}
{"text":"Just had a great dinner. For my first time here it was overall pretty good.  We had a flight of beers and the chefs special with the prime rib sandwich and the pretzel sticks. I didn't find a beer i loved,  but most of them were decent.  Best part of the whole place is the ambiance.  Loved the wood everywhere and the misters in the patio"}
{"text":"Awesome beer choices, really creative and so many are rotating! We sat in the new side tasting room area and wow do they know their beer! I said I couldn't remember which saison I liked best and he went through them all and described them with such detail. I chose one but then he brought me two tasters and said \"decide for yourself\" as in he described them but he still let me taste two to make sure my taste buds Were matching up with what my brain is was saying. They are very considerate and passionate about you choosing the beer that you want. We got a pint each and ended up doing a flight as well as trying a taster here and there of a beer that we were questioning them on and didn't even ask for but they really want you to try their beers and see how amazing they are for yourself. We were there for hours enjoying beer and left with a growler fill. Every time we're in town we go to Arizona Wilderness and save our growler in the car for one of their beers because they're so amazing!"}
{"text":"Best burgers around! Service is always great, and the wait for a table is never as long as they say it will be. Upgrade to the duck fat fries, totally worth the $1 up charge. I also love how their beer list is ever changing, and I haven't had a problem finding one to enjoy with my meal yet. Green chile artichoke dip is also to die for."}
{"text":"First time here, seemed decently busy for a Sunday. The beer and food was awesome, definitely a fan. Service was prompt and friendly. I'll definitely be back. I could see the seating and parking lot being a problem when its really busy."}
{"text":"My wife and her book club ate here last night.  She parked in what was labeled their overflow parking lot and her and 2 other members of her book club got towed.  Looks like they don't have permission to use the office buildings parking lot as overflow parking as labeled.  A 4th person came out while she was out there and he was towed too.  There are lots of great places to eat in Gilbert.  Who needs the headaches or the added expense and inconvenience.   Stay away"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place.  We love the beers!  Getting a flight is a good way to try a bunch and it is not expensive.  I love sour beers so I am glad they always have those.  Their Flyin' Belgian Pig in Beer Cheese that is fried in duck fat is amazing.  Like them on Facebook and you can see what they are tapping.  They have pecan pie and peanut brittle beer around the holidays.  I always pick this place when my hubby and I go out.  I love it."}
{"text":"Food was great, beer tasty and fresh, service a bit lacking, seating cramped, parking sucks.  This all on a busy Tuesday night. I know, right? Tuesday? Oh, but it WAS Taco Tuesday and it was a great place for a UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event), meeting new friends, trying new food and drinking fresh brew from the only brewery in Chandler. Score, thanks Joe, for putting that together!  I ordered the two tacos on the menu that night, pulled pork and chicken something, and both were very tasty. The fries stole the show though, and if ya get the flying pig fries you might not want to share, but you will! (see my tip)  I was really in the mood for whiskey, but don't even think about it, they brew beer, and that's what you're stuck with! So when in Rome...I got the flight. Cool deal, too, because ya get to pick which 5 (see my pic of my picks).  My favorite, I think, was any of the pale ales. Hoppyness abounds, and very flavorful! I also liked the coffee infused ale, not sure the name for I saved it for last and lost my menu list...oh well. I do remember the Woosley Wit...not a fan! Tried to be fruity, but, ehh, no.   Can't wait to go back and get some more o them thar fries and sample more beers. They rotate, and I like trying new things. (see my profile tagline)."}
{"text":"Great vibe in this establishment! Pretty good food. I didn't try a burger this go round but I will next time. I am a French fry connoisseur and I can tell you these fries fried I duck fat get two snaps, a high five and a back hand slap!  They have an ever changing brew menu and they even make they're own ketchup! That's pretty awesome. The service was fantastic! The place stays packed so they must be doing something right. I highly recommend trying them out!"}
{"text":"If you want trendy, this is the place for you.  If you want well crafted beers not so much.  In general the beer they brew has too many fruits and vegetables and not enough careful brewing.  The various flavors tended to overpower the beer itself.  I am not a big fan of IPAs and the rest of their selection did not include any types beers that I would normally like.  I had their local farmer lunch special which was ok but nothing special in the way of taste or flavors.  It was hamburger in an acorn squash. The side salad was also ok but did not have a lot of stuff in it other than lettuce.  The meal was overpriced."}
{"text":"I love eating and drinking local - these guys put the two together as well as anyone in the brewery business.    Can't say enough about the variety of locally inspired craft beers that come in four separate categories:  Monastic, American, Farmhouse and Sours.    Depending on the time and day, weather, what I'm eating and who I'm with - they have something that will hit the mark.   I'm a fan of saisons and I'm continually impressed by the variety of saisons available.   Leading local brewery in the PHX area for certain."}
{"text":"The menu is too complex for a brewery and the beer is just ok. They should put their focus on one or the other."}
{"text":"Really great food!!! Who would have thought a brewy place would have such a great food too. From appetizers to dessert to entree, they've all did an awesome job. Couldn't be any satisfied!!! Must try the wings. The meat is so tender & the seasoning was just right. Mushroom burger is to die for. I'm not a burger person but I actually ate the whole burger. Dessert with fruit was awesome. They really use fresh fruits. It's not the frozen ones you buy in a bag. Thank you for an awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Great brewery! We sat in the tasting room and grabbed a quick few 5oz beers and an appetizer. Quick service, friendly bartender. They had a Belgian that was nearly 10% super smooth and tasty. Really great beers, we don't live nearby but will definitely be back when we're in the area!"}
{"text":"Greeted by two friendly hostess who took our name for table for two and informed us of 20-30 minute wait, not bad for Saturday lunch crowd.  We were invited to lounge on rustic patio benches while sampling some of there hand crafted brews!  Also the patio is DOG FRIENDLY a bonus for K9 lovers!! Unfortunately we discovered NO WINE or CRAFTED BREW options available for those with gluten intolerance so my bride simply enjoyed a nose experience of my Super Coffee Stout.  Seated as promised then promptly greeted by server Tessa who was outstanding!  We shared a refreshingly delicious Beet Apple & Goat cheese salad to begin with then each enjoyed a grass fed generous portioned Beet & Goat cheese burger.  My bride's came accidentally with bun which was caught by the keen eye of Tessa who immediately offered to return it for the gluten free option.  Food service, table clearing and check presentation all timely.  A visit to the men's room was disappointing in seeing the sink clogged and paper towel dispenser empty.  I notified the nearest employee to inform and she apologized and stated someone would resolve.  Overall ambiance was festive and pleasant with two options for outdoor dining.  We would have rated a 5 star but NO WINE or GLUTEN FREE BEER option leveled us at 4 stars."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! Had the 'Merica Fries which have barbecue sauce, bacon and a little cheese sauce on them! The fries are cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside and kinda soft on the inside!  I also had the Hawaiian Wilderness Burger which was a perfect combination of sweet and savory! It's definitely messy though so it's great that theres a napkin dispenser on the table.  I had iced tea and it was also very good, which is quite impressive for a brewery."}
{"text":"Great service, food and duck fat!!!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"\"Alcohol may be man's worst enemy, but the bible says love your enemy.\" - Frank Sinatra   Stopped in for a burger but ended up staying for the beer!  We dropped by on Saturday around 2ish thinking we'll avoid the ASU homecoming game's rush and boy were we wrong.  It was busy as heck!  We were originally told that it would be a 40min wait so we went to the bar for some Picocho Pecan Pie Ale.  I wasn't even half-way done when the hostess seek us out to let us know our table was ready.  Can't complain about a short wait time!  Yas, girl!  After a quick look at the menu, I was torn between the Hawaiian Wilderness and The Kater.  The waiter who had immediately gave us glasses of water as soon as we sat down had overheard and told us all about how great The Kater was especially with a brisket blend burger instead of the chicken patty.  I was sold!  It had sautéed arugula, avocado slices, lettuce, tomato, red onion rings, and cheddar cheese on a brioche bun. He also recommended that we get the wings with the dry-rub and the habanero honey mustard sauce on the side.  Also recommended to the mister was an Arizona Trail burger since he likes spice.  We both ended up substituting our fries for Belgische Frietjes.  It's worth the $1 upgrade for hand-cut fries cooked in duck fat with rosemary and thyme.  This guy really knows his stuff because everything came out delicious.  We also had the Superstition Coffee Stout and it was aromatic.  With food being great and service being more than friendly, how can we not be back?  I still need to try the Jimmy Eat World brew!  They're also in the middle of expanding so more seats means less wait.  More than your average vanilla bar food.  Nicely done!"}
{"text":"The craft beer is amazing. The food is fantastic. And the owner is a hoot. He just wanted to have a brewery and a friend of his said hire me and start a restaurant and that's what he did. The prices are well worth the food. Definitely visiting at least once a month."}
{"text":"Great place, great atmosphere. The place is alwayse busy if thats saying anything. Been there many times and have no complaints other than trying to find a parking spot. Friendly staff and alwayse clean. There is also is also great outdoor seating. Try it."}
{"text":"First time here and had a wonderful experience. Food and beer is great! Our server Joe was knowledgeable and provided excellent service. He much of the reason for a 5 stars review. Loved the house made sauces and pickled veggies! Fav beers: their flagship beer Refuge IPA and the coffee stout!"}
{"text":"We had the jalapeño meatloaf sliders and the Sycamore Canyon Saison and BA Sweet Potato Saison. I'm a sucker for a good beer and each had a hint of their own speciality. The food NEVER disappoints no matter the time or day. The servers usually suck and don't listen.... But the food luckily outweighs the service."}
{"text":"I must say the beers are better than the food. Enjoyed a flight that consisted of Muck Elbow Mild (Pu-erh), the Porter, Coffee Stout, Sweet Potato Saison and the Aravaipa Abbey Dubbel. All very good. We really enjoyed the coffee stout it had lots of coffee flavor, in the Muck Elbow you could really taste the chocolate and the Sweet Potato was a great blend of lots of wonderful flavors but we really couldn't distinguish the taste of sweet potato and it might have been one of our favorites. The chicken drumsticks were good but didn't wow us, maybe if we ordered them again I'd try another dipping sauce rather than the beer cheese although on its own the beer cheese was good. We also had apple brie burger which was good but not great even with upgrading the beef. At that price point I've had much better and bigger burgers. We also upgraded to the fries but again they were just fries, nothing extra special. We had the cannoli nachos which was certainly different and very tasty and it came with fresh fruit which included huge blueberries. This was probably the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Super knowledgeable staff, great beer, delicious food, and a legit atmosphere. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place! The atmosphere is fantastic plus they are dog friendly! The beer is really good and my favorites are when they do the dirty hop water series. They are delicious cloudy IPA 's! My only complaint would be they do tons of saisons which I'm not a big fan of. The food is beyond amazing! It's literally the best burger I've ever eaten! It was so juicy and cooked to perfection and you could really tell the quality! The wings are very unique and quite meaty and so good! One of our favorites is the Pork Belly Sliders you get three and they are so tasty. Yum yum yum! Plus their French fries are so perfect! This place is wonderful and we'll be back over and over! Only thing I wish they had was maybe a food happy hour deal like cheap fries or pretzels would be a nice touch as it gets a little pricey here;)"}
{"text":"Great service, excellent decor and nice people.  Beer...crafty and not my style.  No Browns or Amber.  Artsy food that just didn't seem to jell.  I hope it gets better as I could really like this place."}
{"text":"If you want an authentic wilderness eating experience including an ant covered table, this maybe the place for you! Food was good but once finished we noticed that our indoor table had ants climbing on it. We brought to our servers attention so the management can address the pests when closed. Regardless how good the food was this experience was unsettling. Also, the manner of how this was addressed shows incompetent customer service. The management did not even reply to my email."}
{"text":"My favorite brewery and one of my favorite restaurants, not only in Arizona, but overall! We have always had at least decent service (up to excellent), even when they are on a two hour wait. I highly recommend their incredible burgers...any of them. They are always cooked EXACTLY as asked, from perfect medium rare to well done. The peanut butter and jalapeno jelly is sooooo good. Or the apple and brie. Or the \"regular\" one. I'm not a slider fan, but...theirs are great! Meatloaf usually skeezes me out, but their jalapeno meatloaf sliders are different enough not to \"slider bore\" me! And the pork belly... And the Tuesday duck tacos... And the duck fat fries! The daily specials and beer pairing dinners have been creative and just plain fun. All this rambling and I haven't even mentioned the incredible beers. I LOVE porters and stouts and they have had too many amazing ones to name one (pecan pie porter, barrel aged granola, superstition coffee, presidential, chocobunny...). They do some amazing barrel-aged and farmhouse saisons and sours. I have even choked down a couple decent IPA's. The parking is hideous...but their valets do a superb job. I LOVE the tasting room. I'm a fan. Drank the koolaid...many many times!"}
{"text":"This place is literally around the corner from where we live. Good beer good food nice staff. We will continue coming here!"}
{"text":"Great selection of tasty beers! Fun place to go with friends. Awesome burgers, don't shy away from peanut butter and jalapeño burger."}
{"text":"Bomb diggity! A buddy and I swung by to get some dinner and after hearing so much about this place, I'm glad I finally tried it for myself. Walking in I kinda get the hipster vibe howrver every employee was completely nice and courteous! We had a couple of their drinks from what they recommended, and got pretzel appetizer! The only reason I chose the beer was because menu says the prickly pear are forged in the forest by employees. The waitress confirmed and I found it hilarious! The beer was pretty good but I could only have 2 since they had a sweet bitter flavor to it. I got some after hike burger (secret: I sat around all day and did no exercise before devouring the burger). It had pork belly, burger, bacon, and a egg on it! I was in love! The flavors all went together and I wish I had room for another! The waitress staff was quick and made sure they took care of us as soon as our water was empty and checked on us many times. Def will make a trip back!"}
{"text":"I misjudged the place. It is not a beer swilling bar atmosphere at all, which if I'm being honest, is what I was looking for this evening. I was alone, so wanted to drink some quality beers and carry on a bit, and I was bored. That having been said, I will be back with the proper mind set. The food being cooked smelled great, and I will go there when I am looking for a food and drink establishment rather than a \"night out\", and meet with friends. There is no smoking, indoors or out, which will be a positive for most.  Some of their beers are a bit lofty and pretentious. I made the mistake of ordering the flyer. It is 6 beers served in 5 ounce glasses,  and they were not the kind I care for, with meads and wine barley and all kinds of silly stuff that I don't like. They were 4 dollars a piece, so the flyer came in at 24 dollars for 30 ounces of beer. Expensive for someone who balked at the 7.99 burger price, which in hindsight would have been the smart choice. It's what I'll do next time. Then I ordered the signal mountain stout and it made the tab worthwhile. This is in the top 5 beers I've ever had, and trust me, that's a lot. It is far more interesting than a Guiness or a Murphys irish, equally as complex as a sam smith's oatmeal, and approaching the divinity of North Coasts Russian Imperial stout, the mecca when it comes to flavor complexity and character.  They need to continue making this, and they will receive notice from me to that end.  I'm guessing the froofy sniffer it was served in was 12 or 14 ounces. It was 5.50. The flavors are layered and change from first approach to final swallow, even to the aftertaste. First rate premium stuff.  Next time I will go and, eat, order two well chosen pints, and get out of there for twenty bucks and a full tummy. Understand this is not a bad review, just a fool admitting his mistakes and level of unpreparedness. Now you are smarter. Go have fun. This would be a great place to \"pregame\" for a more raucous event.  Also a fine place for daddy to take the wife and kids and enjoy dinner and a couple beers, in Mesa no less."}
{"text":"It's not often that I find a new beer that I truly love. We stopped in for a drink a few weeks ago and I found 3! I can't even remember what they were, but they were fantastic. Apparently they brew new beers all the time. I love that!  We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"First of all we can't talk about AZ wilderness without talking about the beer.  Which I will, but first I want to talk about the food. The burgers can be described no other way but amazing.  Juicy and delicious they are not mere burgers but works of culinary art built on a common canvas.  The appetizers are likewise delicious especially the Bavarian pretzels and the green chili pork sliders.    Now the beer.  With a constantly rotating selection of beers the one you had last time and really liked will most likely not be there this time, but that is OK there is sure to be something else that suits your taste on today's menu.  The beer here is all well brewed and flavorful.  They make traditional commonly seen beers but where the real gold is with the brews made with unusual or interesting ingredients and less common styles.  For example right now they have a Gose style made with smoked apples from a local farm.  If you appreciate variety and a knowledgeable and friendly staff this is a place you need to visit repeatedly. Went for another visit again today.  I can now testify that the pulled pork sandwich is also fantastic.  Also if you are lucky enough to be there while they have the Blonde Stout on tap have a glass it is one of the best beers I have had here!"}
{"text":"This place is stupid delicious.  The food and drinks selection...out of this world.   AZ Wilderness is the home of my favorite burger that I have ever eaten in my entire life. That is high praise if you know me because I have eaten more than a million burgers in my lifetime.   This place also keeps pushing the envelope beer-wise and I am thankful for the fact I can take these home!  BB's Rating: BURGERTASTICBEERTASTIC"}
{"text":"Neat set up. Friendly staff. I had the superstition coffee stout, not bad. I wanted the chocolate bunny but they were out. A brewery, out of a beer. Did some appetizers, not all the impressed. It is a brewery."}
{"text":"We love this place for their unique beer offerings, outdoor patio, and friendly service. We've had every beer on the menu, several of their delicious burgers, and the crispy duck fat fries. Last time we were there I had the veggie burger and it was a surprising treat - black beans fried to a generous crisp. They are crowded evenings and weekends so plan ahead. Really nice."}
{"text":"Went in last night to check this place out. The first thing that hits you is the noise as it is a very popular place for the 20/30's crowed.  Also young families have a spot on the patio for the kids. I was having a slight misgiving until I tried their food and hand crafted beer.  I was blown away.  My date and I have the wings (French confit style) and the Green Chile Pork sliders. First, the wings were out of this world. We generally get the dry rub and the kitchen did not disappoint. The meat just falls of the bone and has tremendous flavor. Next we tried the sliders and also were very impressed. Soft pretzel bun with very well cooked pull pork with just enough green chile to make it interesting.  Now the beer.  BTW - no other alcohol is served. Just their beer. My date had the Superstition Coffee Stout which was extremely smooth and not too filling. I had the double Pale which was amber in color and full of flavor.  We will be back, especially when my son visits from Atlanta.  He is a big beer aficionado and will enjoy this place immensely. The food just blew me away and we will also remember to get there early so we can sit outside."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went here for lunch. The lunch hour is busy but not unbearable busy. We were sat right away at a table inside as requested. This place has a very fun atmosphere and a huge patio that wraps around the building.   The food: The chicken sandwich was AMAZING. So fresh and so much flavor! The onion rings were light and tasty. The fries pictured were good however we were not a big fan of the BBQ sauce that was on them. Not the restaurants fault that our taste buds didn't love it.   The beer flight was so fun and only $10, $2 a pop, not bad.   All in all this is a fun spot. We will be back to try some other things for sure!"}
{"text":"What a great spot! I can't say enough good things about this place. The staff and owners obviously care about customer service. The beer selection is basic to avant-garde...not too many offerings to overwhelm; but enough to keep it interesting. We ordered a \"flight\" of their beers for tasting.   I thought it was a fun touch that you can see on a chalkboard the current in-process status of the brew-crew's various new fermentations .  The food selection is short and sweet, to maintain quality. My wife ordered an interesting ground beef & ground brisket mix burger on a brioche bun, and I ordered the \"frenched\" chicken wing drummies with the tasty house-made BBQ beer sauce (not too sweet and not ketchup-y, two things I detest about most BBQ sauces). Both of us enjoyed and shared. Hand-cut fresh potato chip frites accompanied the burger, not salty at all, just delicious.  In fact, my wife said afterwards \"that was the best burger in a really, really long time\".  And we took home a growler!   The décor reflects the love of the owners for Arizona's unique and diverse landscape. The beauty of Arizona's non-urban wide-open spaces seems to be the main theme here.  Another reviewer commented this place had a nice 'vibe\", I totally agree. No beer snobs here, just people who care about their product.  I highly recommend visitng AWBC. Once you've tasted the beauty of handmade brew craft, you'll be hooked."}
{"text":"My review is strictly for the brew, as we didn't order anything else.   $12 for a flight?! Yes, I will always be in!  I'm just sad that we missed Stout season.   Staff was great, place was clean and the brew was good. Will come back again when they bring out the stouts!"}
{"text":"Out of the 30+ breweries I have been to in the state of Arizona, this one BY FAR has the greatest beer. The Refuge is one of the best west coast IPAs in the state, their sours are unparalleled,  and their northeast IPAs are superb. I guarantee you will find a beer you like there.   Their burgers are also incredible; all their food is great. However, they nickel and dime you for everything. $1 for a dipping sauce, $2.50 for fries with your burger, etc. When all is said and done, it is difficult to get a meal there for under $15."}
{"text":"The place was packed full when we got there, so we grabbed a beer while we waited. I was pleased with their beer selection and taste was great (their beers change, so no sense in commenting on specific ones). Wait staff was friendly and corrected errors that they had made (which was a few, but they took care of it well!). Food is great, a little more expensive than what you would think food in a basket should cost. All around this place was great, the reason it doesn't get 5 stars is due to the fact that it is too small inside! Oh and instead of doing a slide show on some of your TVs, have a game going (like you do up at the bar)."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  Beer was good.  Food was good (burgers).  That being said, the menu is rather limited.  You got burgers, chicken or pork sandwiches.  Also, very small inside and limited indoor seating.  The above being said, good place and will probably be back...just need to be sure I go when it won't be crowded."}
{"text":"Great beer, very good food. What more can you ask for? My wife and I love local craft brewery's an we frequent them often. This was our first visit here because it's not exactly around the corner but it was definitely worth the drive. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in town.  Best home cooked chips. Best everything on the menu. They use LOCAL products. Best service in town. I don't drink beer, but those I have gone to Arizona Wilderness Brewing with always love their brews.  Just a great place......and now we'll have to wait for a table because people may see this review. We love Arizona Wilderness Brewing."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow.   Food was delicious not your topical burger they have very exotic ones.   The beer was just ok,  or maybe I didn't pick the right flavors on my flight.    Prices were average.    I will come back to try another of the burgers."}
{"text":"Boy, where do I start? Everything on the menu sounds delicious. The beer is always rotating and always interesting. Th food is absolutely out of this world. We had the pork belly nachos, waffle onion rings, and pork belly burger. Every item was out of this world. I've been a die hard for 4 peaks for years, but I'm afraid I may have to switch jerseys this season."}
{"text":"We got a flight of different IPAs, all were great! We are in the hazy IPA world now coming from the east coast and the ones here were good. We ordered duck fat fries loaded and the chicken quesadilla. Would have been a 5 Star if the menu was a bit more diverse. Nearly everything was a combination of bacon, cheese, and meat. Not a bad thing though, depending. :)"}
{"text":"Dude. I am so happy. You know how sometimes, you go to a place for the first time and expect the visit to be nothing but great? Well, so far I have received nothing but THAT!  AND they play hip hop:) NOT RAP---hip hop. There is a difference.   Brewing all of their beers here, and when they run out--- THEY MAKE SOMETHING NEW. Certainly a refreshing experience and I will be back."}
{"text":"This is the first brewery in Arizona that reminds me of quality California beer! We wanted to try the majority of the beers so we got 2 flights. We loved every single one! I would HIGHLY recommend this place. Didn't try the food, but I'm assuming it is as equally as awesome. Favorite beer: Futures Saison"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. It's one of my top five places in AZ so far. The food is delicious and consistent. They have something for everyone. The staff is always really friendly and patient. My favorites are The Trail Burger, 'Merica Fries (add pulled pork) and the Chicken Confeit. I honestly have not had a bad beer, either."}
{"text":"Great beer, good tacos. It's right across from my work place so this is a go to spot for me to go down a few good beers after a long day with friends. Nothing but good things to say about wilderness!"}
{"text":"Fabulous selection for making a delightful flight and friendly, relaxed atmosphere.  The Hummingbird was delicious."}
{"text":"wife had the Belgian expression and thought it was good but Terrible wait time and nothing for Gluten Free People"}
{"text":"Had the wheat berry salad with added chicken and it was pretty good! My boyfriend got the regular cheeseburger and his was yummy too! Hummus appetizer wasn't anything special and pita bead was a bit soggy. If you're in the mood for pub food and alcohol this place is a decent spot"}
{"text":"Fab food, great beer, shook hands with the owner... heaven"}
{"text":"I've watched this brewery build up from the beginning! It is owned and ran by people who are passionate about what they are doing and WILL NOT settle for anything less than what they believe in! They use local and organic ingredients and will ALWAYS take the time to tell you about the process! They are always up to date via social media(Facebook and Instagram..like them!) with what is new and upcoming as well as daily specials! $10.99 for a beer and the most amazing burger ever?! Can't beat that during the week anywhere! Good job Az Wilderness! Way to show the valley how it's done!"}
