{"text":"There are no words to explain how horrific the meal, service, and ambiance was at this restaurant.

Imagine, 3 day holiday weekend, Game 7 NBA playoffs, peak dinner time, and the place looked like the attached photo. Completely empty bar and restaurant, and right when we walked in we knew it was going to be a joke of a meal, but we gave it a shot.

It was, indeed, a joke of a meal. The tortilla chips were so salty, the salsa was terrible, the shrimp tacos were extremely sour and salty at the same time (how is that even possible?), and the chimichangas were made of chicken that was really not chicken. 

My first bite of the shrimp tacos and I said out loud \"Wow, this is like poison.\" 

You would have to TRY REALLY HARD to make a meal as bad as this. Unbelievable. 

To make it worse, the service was horrible, even though it was an empty restaurant! HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE? Mind blown. 

I'm shocked the management (or lack thereof) hasn't taken any effort to improve this place. So pathetic. Someone needs to be fired."}
{"text":"This place is newly remodeled in a modern, rustic Mexican decor.  There drinks are amazing and delicious.  Try the margaritas.  The food is fresh and delicious.  I loved the fish tacos and guacamole.  The house made salsa is jicama based.  It is good ,but I would prefer something that is tomato or pico salsa based.  It is definitely worth a try especially if you are staying at the Holiday Inn Resort."}
{"text":"Located in the Holiday Inn Vacation Resort which I love, but this restaurant is ridiculously bad.  Every single table was upset at wait and wrong orders. I ordered take out and it took 40 minutes longer than the 15 min.  They threw in some cake to make up for it. I had 4 starving kiddos.  
The kids burgers were undercooked and the fries tasted as if the fry machine oil was borrowed from last years state fair.  Inedible.  Fries!!  Come on. 
The Server tried to be pleasant.  I felt bad for her. 

One positive, pretty decor. 
That is it!  
Order in from door dash or buy groceries. The kitchens here are great."}
{"text":"For a hotel restaurant, food was very good and service was extremely friendly and professional. I would have no problem eating there multiple times and finding great menu options to try. Good job."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and amazing food! They offer a great selection for all ages. Be sure to check out Pioneer Pepper!!"}
{"text":"This southwestern themed cantina is one of the best in Arizona. I had yet gone somewhere with such a unique  and perfected menu. Everything coming out of there kitchen smelled amazing. There fajitas sizzle an except aroma that will keep you coming back for more. They had several selections of tacos for everyone to choose from, including chicken, beef, pork, smoked salmon and shrimp. There service was also amazing. There servers looked happy and engaged the whole time. They checked on us at appropriate times and helped make our experience unforgettable."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my meal here when I stayed at the Scottsdale Resort. Tacos and really good drinks! So convenient and the staff was great! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant as we are staying at the villas here and the high yelp reviews. On the positive side, the atmosphere is very nice and the meal presentations were very appealing.  The food, however, was marginal.  I ordered the steak fajitas.  The steak had not been marinated so it had no flavor and was not seasoned. The onions and peppers were very well prepared, but not enough to flavor the steak.   My husband ordered the house salad with smoked salmon.  The salad and the lime vinaigrette were very good..  Everything was fine until he encountered several fish bones that he had to spit out. Lastly, we ordered chips and salsa which came out with the meal rather than as a starter.  Not exactly when it was expected."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give this place one star. It was a long day after traveling and we decided to stay on the resort, to have dinner, for convenience. The service was verrry slow although the waitress was kind and polite. The food is horrendous! All 4 of ya plus the children agreed this place was the worst place we had ever eaten in! The food was disgusting, over cooked, lacked flavour, or tasted rotten. They also don't label food properly. For example, i ordered fajitas but they were not fajitas. They used some gross salsa to over cook my chicken and then gave me stinky cheese, lettuce and tomatoes.. no guacamole or sour cream and they had zero fajita flavour. We were all so surprised because literally every single meal was gross and we could not finish it. Seriously, so not go here! McDonald's is better than this."}
{"text":"Great place!!! Service was a little slow but made up for it in food tastes.  Great atmosphere too from someone who travels for work, this is a must stay!!"}
{"text":"The food and service are great! There are so many great options on the menu. I loved the singing cowboy, Pioneer Pepper, on Thursday evening!"}
{"text":"Our meals were delicious and service was great! No wait and food came out quickly, so very convenient."}
{"text":"So so. We ordered here a few times while we stayed at the Holiday Inn Resort. The food was pretty good but the they were really slow each time and got our order wrong and didn't really do anything to make it right(I.e. no apps, drinks or refunds) while we waited on them to fix the issue. Not bad food or anything but they could do better on service and speed. They are well staffed, so there was no excuse."}
