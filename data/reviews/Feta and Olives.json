{"text":"OK at best. 

Chicken pita with everything. Chicken was really dry.  Tender and steaming from the heater but dry. I don't know how that's possible. It was like the chicken was old or something before they cooked it. Tsziki was bland and almost watery. 

It wasn't terrible. Just not very good, even by regular Shwarma / pita places."}
{"text":"I liked this place!  Really good portion for the money!  The owner who works the place is very nice and approachable.  Please try it out!  Great stop for vegans like myself as well!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I go at least once a week when I don't feel like cooking, or when I'm craving Greek food. The owner and young lady who work their are very friendly and always give me a ton of food. My favourite is the chicken souvlaki dinner. They also have frozen yogurt, which I haven't tried yet, but it looks really good. If you are in the area for a game or concert, give it a go."}
{"text":"Feta olives is my favourite go to in the area. The place has really improved under new management, not only are all the ingredients fresher, but the staff is friendlier as well. My go to is the falafel which is made fresh to order and has a perfect crunch! The pasta salad is amazing, much better than the Longos salad bar. There's also a Yogen Fr√ºz in the same location so easy to parlay a 1-2 dinner/dessert combo."}
{"text":"Not the best quality. Good enough for a quick Greek fix, if that's what you crave. I ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner, and the only saving grace was the generous portion of tzatziki they dropped on my plate. Other than that, this place isn't worth returning to. Chicken was bland and they gave me a tiny amount. I love Greek food and I was really disappointed by this place."}
{"text":"There's a reason why this place is always on Groupon.  While service is great and friendly, the food is just bland, tasteless and just \"off\".  I can't put my finger on what exactly is wrong with it, the falafels were freshly made to order, but the meal was definitely unsatisfactory.  I hope they kick their recipes up a notch, they've got nothing on Jimmy the Greek or other comparable take away Greek restaurants."}
{"text":"I feel bad about the star ratings as the food was edible but not very good. Based on the dishes served it is a Mediterranean restaurant but it was not at all like I expected. The chicken was bland, the rice was bland, the potatoes were bland (and boiled?). Honestly I was expected \"greek potatoes\", not boiled potatoes. I was surprised to be offered hot sauce for my souvlaki, as I don't remember ever seeing that before at Mediterranean restaurants. The hot sauce, although spicy, tasted mostly of olive so that was sort of unique. It just seems to have an identity problem. The food doesn't seem authentic or at least what I'm accustomed from Mediterranean restaurants, nor was it that good."}
{"text":"I discovered this restaurant through a Groupon offer that I thought was a pretty good deal ($6 for $12 worth of food) so my friend and I decided to split the Groupon and try the restaurant out. 

This restaurant is located on Yonge Street in the Harbourfront area (Pinnacle Centre condos - just south of Lakeshore/Gardiner Expressway). A short walk from Union Station, this Greek food eatery is not hard to find at all. This location also serves Yogenfruz frozen yogurt but note that the Groupon is only valid for the wraps/salads and nothing else so it is best to share the voucher with a friend...unless you are really hungry.

When we got to the place, there was a bit of a lineup with only one person working both the cash and the food. For this reason, we experienced slow service and we had to wait a few minutes to even get our orders in which is kind of disappointing considering the restaurant is in a hot tourist area and I would have expected a bit more staff members on deck. Nonetheless, we were eventually served and the lady was friendly enough. 

My friend ordered the chicken souvlaki pita while I ordered the gyros pita with donair sauce. The meat was OK - a little dry, and it could have been spiced and seasoned a little bit more and the size of the wrap was average, albeit a little expensive for $7.00. The donair sauce was not very good at all. It had a jelly-like consistency which did not look appetizing at all nor did it taste good. It was sweet but I found it lacked in the garlic department... and I really just could not get over the gelatinous texture of it. From my past experience, I've always thought donair sauce was supposed to be creamy and smooth...not weird jelly. I ended up eating only half of the gyros wrap because it really wasn't that good. My friend said she wasn't really satisfied with her chicken souvlaki either. They used a lot of the fatty parts of the chicken which made it an unpleasurable chewing experience and the tzatziki sauce was also just OK in flavour but a little on the watery side. 

Overall, I wasn't really a fan of this place. The service was slow and the food was not that good. I don't think the wraps are worth $7 each so I am glad we got a Groupon to cut the cost in half. If they add more staff to support the summer tourist season as well as make changes to their products (ie. tweak their sauces, add a little more flavour to the meat, maybe use a different part of the chicken for the pitas, etc) then the customer experience may be more satisfactory in the future."}
{"text":"Not a fan, everything was just off with my meal. I had the souvlaki meal to go and can't say I was satisfied. The meat didn't taste very natural, and the tzatziki sauce made things even worse, and tasted like it had been out awhile. The side of rice was small and instead they give you a whole bunch of salad. Not great value for the price. At least the service was friendly."}
{"text":"Wholly decent Mediterranean franchise place that I frequented because I worked right across the street and because I didn't have a lot of other options in the area until a food court opened up two minutes away. Pretty typical stuff that you'd expect at one of these places (falafel, shawarma, souvlaki, gyros, etc.) as well as a Yogen Fruz for some reason. I'm not big on frogurt so I never sampled that, but can speak toward the falafels. 

The sandwiches are made fresh (falafels cooked on the spot) so it is a step above a sandwich shop that just reheats the things but it lacks the flavour of most authentic, smaller places or even a Villa Madina. Tasty enough with nice, fresh ingredients just not fantastic and sort of neutral tasting really. Like Lebanese food for people who aren't sure if they like Lebanese food. Also I really never cared for the pitas that they used to wrap the things in. They're a little on the fluffy / doughy side and aren't the most conducive in actually creating a wrap, so unless you're quite careful, you may have a mess on your hands.

The sides are all actually quite good (nice choice of potatoes, rice, tabbouleh, salad, noodles, etc.) but again sort of on the bland side when compared with your more authentic middle-eastern places. Again not at all bad, just not amazing. Be prepared to add hot sauce to your noodles and tzatziki to your rice and potatoes. 

So it's a nice enough place if you work in the area and I was also quite happy to support them while I was working nearby. The owner is a great guy and the type of small business owner that you want to see do well. But it's also a place that I never felt comfortable writing a review for until I no longer worked across the street, on the off chance he reads this. I wanted to give him four stars based on the excellent service but I just couldn't bump it up from a solid three. Still, do check it out if you're in the area...I just don't think I'd make a special trip."}
{"text":"Fast food greek food. Don't expect too much. It's your typical fast food chain that sells souvlakis gyros and falafals. The falafals was not fresh and was a little drier than normal. The side salads had no taste. The souvlaki was standard - nothing special."}
{"text":"The people here are really nice and it's cool that they have Mediterranean food plus a Yogen Fruz with yummy flavours (cheesecake, green tea, etc.). But the food was really sub-par, even with low fast-food standards. I had the falafel dinner plate and the falafel were like grenades. They were too hard for my plastic knife to handle, and really dry on the inside as Ada T. mentioned... You get a choice of 2 sides, which are pretty bland (rice, green salad, potatoes, chickpea salad). It's not even that cheap... I would pick a Mom & Pop falafel place over this chain any day."}
{"text":"Restaurant under new management and their food and service has significantly gotten better. Visit after 3pm for $5 beef gyro with pop is hands down the best deal! Been coming here for the past 6 years."}
{"text":"Fresh food prepared daily, large portions, and very reasonable prices. This restaurant got new management and the new owner is excellent at customer service and seems to care about satisfying customers.

Their falafel is to die for!! and this is coming from a Middle Eastern who tried every possible falafel there is. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Feta and Olives for a year now and I've seen alot of changes.

Feta and Olives is under new management and they do their best to satisfy their customers. I usually come around 3pm for an after work meal and I am always greeted with a smile and with good conversation. I've been introduced to each of their dishes and how they make them which is always appreciated. Compared to the previous Feta and Olives, I much prefer the team now. 

I usually get the falafel dinner which a current ongoing promotion for 6$. The falafels are freshly made to order, from scratch and are by far the best I've had. Not too hard, not too loose, and fried perfectly to my liking. I pair it with some rice, pasta salad and my most recent favourite, the kale salad (which is a combination of kale and apple). All that for 6$; it's really hard to beat. 

They also serve Yogen-Fruz. Ive never had their fro-yo but it's good to have that option on those hot summer days. 

Overall, this is a go-to place for me. It's in a convenient location by union station and is right by where I live which is why I am a frequent customer. Definitely recommended for everyone to try if you love falafels!"}
