{"text":"The short of it ......mediocre! I purchased a 1/2 price certificate from Cleveland Independents after a friend had said Radius was a good value and had good food. I was glad I had only paid half price. The Radius salad was fresh but uneventful. The dressing provided little taste. The rolls were good and thankfully they served real butter. My fiance's Bass was fresh but nothing to rave about. I had the salmon, poached with the fondu sauce(a white wine sauce) as suggested by the waitress who claims that is what the chef considers the best. . I was hesitant to order salmon poached and I should have gone with my gut. It would have been tasteless without the sauce and even the sauce needed a kick. I asked for more sauce and they brought me a gravy boat full, unfortunately it was cold which I didn't realize until I had poured it over my fish and vegetables. The vegetables again were okay but bland. The service was pleasant and friendly but not as attentive as it could be.  They automatically add 20% gratuity to the bill and it was not 20% service. The atmosphere is also mediocre! They are consistent in their mediocrity.

Sorry Radius! I was hoping for a nice place to eat close to home but it just lacks any excitement for me to come back."}
{"text":"Four of us met for dinner on  a busy Saturday night at Radius. I love that we can have conversation and hear each other. Everything we had was wonderful.  
Filet was the best we have had in years. Loved the spinach salad with a soft poached egg and many tasty ingredients. 
Crab cakes. And wonderful apricot ketchup. 
Afterwards we sat on the lovely patio to watch a glorious sunset and enjoy the breeze of a lovely Ohio summer evening.
Rob our barkeep and server made our evening and let me not forget the great raw oysters.
Truly a hidden gem in Chagrin Falls 
Thanks to Rob Chris and Lisa for making it a special evening.

{"text":"After a good first experience and a fair second one, we had not been back for several months.  The reviews on Yelp were not good, so we went back last night to see if Radius had gotten better.  It had.  We had delicious meals at fair prices with great service.  Our server, Shannon, was a delight and added to our meal.   The noise level is such that you can carry on a conversation without shouting.  We will be back."}
