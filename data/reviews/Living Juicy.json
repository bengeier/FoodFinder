{"text":"I stopped in here on a random weekend around 11-1130a.  It's a very small place (presumably family-owned).  They have a nice variety of juices, though when I checked the refrigerated cabinet, it was slim pickings.  It seems the variety was somewhat lacking after the morning crowd had had first dibs.  

However, the juice I selected was delicious.  The price is comparable to some of the better juices you can find at Whole Foods.  I plan to go back at a later date to try some of the other flavors.

I would also be interested in trying some of the foods that they have as well."}
{"text":"This place is my new obsession. Both kale salads are absolutely fantastic. And their juices come in cute little mason jars! Big big fan of Living Juicy."}
{"text":"Love the tropical cleanse smoothie. All made to order. FRESH!! Friendly and sweet owners!"}
{"text":"I seriously adore this place! It's always challenging to find somewhere that has actually healthy delicious food for lunch and I'm so happy I work close to living juicy! I've stopped in a few times now and I never am disappointed! I've tried the fill me salad that's amazing and also a couple of the juices and all were so good! Plus the two ladies working there are always friendly and answer any questions I may have!"}
{"text":"Excellent Smoothies. Subtle balance of big flavors  is distinctive and refreshing. This is a must try place."}
{"text":"Ordered the fave smoothie and it was great!! However, when I went (around 1pm) they were out of everything except one juice and 2 salads. I had to wait a while for my smoothie to be made, and the three people working ignored me in the meantime. Then my smoothie totaled to over $10- extremely over priced!!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with the \"Fill Me\" salad at Living Juicy. I could eat it every day. Although it is a vegan salad it is incredibly filling to me (a non-vegan).

I eat it while I am on my lunch break and I feel my focus restored.
I have tried the juices, they are good, but I am all about the salad.

Another plus is that the woman that runs the shop is very knowledgable and always has a very clear answer about what is in the food. I find the atmosphere she creates in her space to be very relaxing."}
{"text":"So the Yelp side says they open at 9am. I arrived at 10am. The door was locked even though  the  hours on  the door said they open at 10am. I waited for over 15 mins and no one  unlocked the doors even  though they should have  been open. I pretty much wasted  my breakfast break waiting  on them to open because  i had a juice from here b4 that was pretty good. If ur a business and have  normal business hours that state u should  b open...be open. Thays totally  unprofessional and disappointing...and there where other ppl oustide waiting...w/no posted reason as to why  they were closed.  They just lost my business"}
{"text":"This place is a family run business - compact yet efficient interior. They have a huge board with many different offerings in place. I'm not vegan/vegetarian/juicer/or specific raw food eater. I was a little hesitate trying this place out because other juice places I've stopped at have weird combinations that are supposed to be good for you but taste unpleasant. All in the name of health, right? Don't get me wrong...I'm all about health though I don't believe I should have to eat/drink things that taste like cardboard.

I picked out My Fave, which is a raw smoothie consisting of kale, coconut meat, coconut water, banana, mango, strawberry, maca root, and sea salt. I was pleasantly surprised! Extremely delighted! It was very, very good! I do believe it's actually My Fave now..ha ha. I saw they had salads which were all gone by the time I rolled up (I think close to 4pm). Can't wait to try one! What I appreciate about this place is there are options for raw smoothies without including dairy in the mix. This place proves I don't have to get almond milk or yogurt in my smoothie for it to taste delicious. Must. Come. Back...asap!"}
{"text":"I had the my fav smoothie and it was delicious. Full of flavor and a great consistency. Sydney the owner is warm and inviting. Great place!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious marinated kale salad that was refreshing and filling. My friend had the Cacao Banana smoothie that was so rich and tasty. Can't wait to try the fresh juices. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Truly delicious organic raw beverages. Had the cold pressed Love and Beets beverage (beets, beet greens, pineapple, green apple) and it's a 10/10. S.O. had the Ginger Turmeric beverage (blended to order frozen fresh bananas, frozen fresh mango, fresh ginger, turmeric, raw honey, coconut milk [FRESH!], cinnamon, sea salt). Again, 10/10. Not easy on the wallet however. 16oz pre-made cold pressed Love and Beets runs $9 (though you get to keep the Bell Mason jar it comes in). The fresh-made Ginger Tumeric runs $11 for 16oz. The Yelp single $ is not accurate for this product line."}
{"text":"Living Juicy satisfies all of my requirements for a fresh juice shop: delicious beet juice. I LOVE the combination here - \"Love & Beets\" has beets, green apple, and pineapple. Now if they added ginger to the mix, I would be here way too often! 

There's a pretty good selection of juices which are pre-made that morning and stored in ready to go mason jars (which you can keep or return). I think it was $4.99 for an 8oz jar and 8.99 for a 16oz. I'd say that's comparable pricing to other juice options I've had in the west coast, upstate New York, and Whole Foods in different cities. 

I've heard from coworkers that the salads here are really good too. I'd like to try more products but sadly, they close pretty early (5-6pm)."}
