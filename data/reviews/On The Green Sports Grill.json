{"text":"This is the worst customer service I have ever had. Been here for 1hour and still no food. Had to go to the bar to get my own drink. Maybe on Friday they should hire more help!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in while. The place has had a lot of changes. I like! I will be back soon."}
{"text":"best dang wings ever.  best bartender, best cook, best place.  Did I mention the food???  BEST EVER!!!!!"}
{"text":"The wings here are sooo good!!! I order medium and they are plenty spicy so any wimps out there might wanna order mild lol. They have a large menu here and everything I have tried as been yummy. I like how you can choose sweet potato or regular fries, both are great.  They do a good pour on the drinks here as well. I love to come on Wednesdays for half price wings. They have good specials during the week."}
{"text":"Well, its wanna be. What do I mean by this ? If the new owner cares here's what it needs to be a great pub.  1.)  Food quality - right now- hit and miss 2.) Presentation -  right now - miss 3.) Manager- miss 4.) Bar - hit In the last week we went their twice to check out different specials  one night wings the other fish fry.  The  wing night - not busy . So we where served in timely manner . What I liked ! iced glasses for the beer! We had 2 different types of wings med hot extra crispy  and garlic parmesan.  the hot wings where great but the garlic parmesan lacked any flavor . When the waitress  was alerted to this she brought a cup of cold garlic and cheese mix . Ok I give her some effort but this really should have been taken to the kitchen and redressed. The chips where excellent    -  hot perfectly done . But no dressing - we had to ask.  Fish night - strangely not busy . Once again we got the beers in good time with the frosty glasses. One of our party noticed that this fish fry came with a salad bar. Which was no where to be seen. So we asked and it was explained to us that they where late getting it out . Ok - so we placed our orders and waited . One of our party like the salad bar - the other wasn't that impressed . Its basic - nothing to make it stand out. What I found interesting was the fish - most fish fry's, the fish is a chunk ,this a fillet that is battered and fried . Now i liked it ( I\"m not a fish person) the other person in the group didn't . As for the coleslaw - just plain awful . It was just mayo with veg. No sweet sour to it . We had chips again great -but no dressing? The burger was disappointing- wet salad, pre- pressed pad , stale bun that they tried to hide by grilling it  and add no flavor to the mix - basically McD's does a better job.   This is where a good manger can make a difference - check the food, get feed back, make sure that dish go out with appropriate accompaniments."}
{"text":"Well, the service was appalling.   I start there because it's the first thing you come upon when you enter an establishment.   I was immediately told I couldn't bring my cup of water in by the bartender (understandable).  I went to return it to the car and when I came back in my family was STILL waiting to be seated.   I went to use the restroom (a shower curtain for a door in the ladies room.  Really?????????) and came back out and they were STILL waiting to be seated.  We should have gone elsewhere.   We finally were told we could sit anywhere.   We did and it was still 5 or so minutes before anyone greeted our groups.    We ordered and it seriously took 45 minutes (with no apology and only the explanation of a 16 top in the restaurant) for our food to arrive.  Our children were remarkable well behaved all things considered.   There is truth to the saying you get what you pay for (we had a BOGO thing for this place).  And of course I was late for my meeting that was scheduled after this lunch.   The good is that it sits on the golf course. And there isn't much better than an Arizona spring time.  Also, everything we ordered wasted great.  Tacos (chicken and beef) were good.   Beans that came with them were too spicy for my adventurous youngest but they were great.   Bleu cheese burger was filled with the cheese and the mayo it was served with was great.  The chicken Cobb was good and the chipotle ranch dressing suited it perfectly.   My sons burger looked great but he wasn't sharing.    We rarely leave less than 18 % especially with coupons or deals, but TIPS are just that... To Insure Prompt Service and this wasn't."}
{"text":"Food is ok , lots of TV's.  Eat inside or out.  Located alongside the fairway.  Service is marginal if you aren't a regular buying drinks. Not sure if there is a manager to keep service standards hovering above indifference."}
{"text":"Certainly above average bar food. Love their fish fry but I don't do the \"all you can eat\" as three pieces (all nice size) fill me up just fine! The burgers are quite delicious too!! Friendly neighborhood atmosphere. Great waitresses/waiters who are kept plenty busy.  Top notch local bar!"}
{"text":"Dont go there. Very unorganized. We reserved a time and amount of peoeple and it took 2 hours to get food. Not a place to come back to. Do.not recommend"}
{"text":"Unless you're a \"regular,\" don't bother with this place. We met some friends here and we had to ask for a waitress after being ignored for quite some time. We ordered food and 45 minutes later, the waitress comes back and says they're out of something we didn't order anyway (we asked for a basket of plain tater tots). Food comes out 30 minutes after that and it's luke warm at best. The tots are covered in 2 different substances (I honestly can't say what they are), they reeked of sour/stale beer, and looked like they had been sitting for at least an hour on the counter. They were completely inedible. The waitress didn't come back around until she came to drop off the check...30 minutes later. She never came back for refills or to check on the food, which was terrible at best. I told her that she delivered the wrong order, even after she had tried to confirm earlier, and she didn't offer to fix it. She did, however, take the whole $3.99 off the bill. So almost 2 hours there with terrible service and horrible food. Sad, because we liked this place before the new owners took over. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been going here for 2 years and ever since jay has been hired as the bar tender the customers have done nothing but walk on shells....I sat at the bar along w 5 other regular patrons and couldn't get service after asking 3 separate employees to serve me ( I had 1 beer prior). I have been disrespected by this bar tender multiple times and nothing's been done. I hope a a bar w such potential doesn't sink due to such ridiculous service."}
{"text":"They have a great happy hour. (3-6 I think) The food is good. The drinks are cold. Pool tables, games and lots of TVs to watch sports. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I've been here several times hoping for more. I'm happy to report I got my wish. If you haven't been here lately you should try it out. Not sure what changed but something definetly has. Much props to owners and management!!!! Finally this place may live up to its potential!!!!! Awesome night. Awesome service and tons of fun!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Mainly because it is so close, but the staff is amazing as well. They good specials and will come back always. Don't forget they have a pet friendly patio"}
{"text":"My new place for lunch service and food amazing day time music something to be desired."}
{"text":"Very relaxed place to go out with a group and enjoy yourself, could use an update of the building but overall is has great bartenders and always a great atmosphere anytime I come here which is at least once a week."}
{"text":"Chicken fingers from here are delicious. Idgaf if they're pre-frozen. Ranch could use a little work- it's pretty watery, but I'm not gonna be too picky. Staff is pretty friendly. Only real reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is it's infested with snow birds that give the stink eye if you bring kids in. Intense stink eye."}
{"text":"Nice comfortable sports bar with a good kitchen and better staff and service. If you go on Thursday or Saturday they have free poker. Otherwise you can pass time with pool, darts, video golf and good times. Oh and the tots are great got to try the tots!"}
{"text":"I gave one star because I had too. We had a large party that I called 4 days in advance for. A perfect opportunity to make some real money. But 2 hours later and we barely got out food. This was so sad. We wanted to so something local but never again!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is like a second home, I'm here 2x a week, They are super accommodating to my dietary needs and even has a special menu just for me!!!  Highly recommend this place if you have gluten allergies"}
{"text":"Ok so I started to type and was bumped and clicked something so I wasn't able to finish.  This place is great, makes me feel I'm back In the Midwest at one our classic hometown bars.  Great drinks, can't complain on food.  Love the OTG!"}
{"text":"Spent 10 minutes watching the waitresses wait on people that came in after me and my family.  If you're not a regular, DONT BOTHER"}
{"text":"You're bully shitting if you leave a negative review on this place. First off, get off your high horse and be real. I just moved here from Portland and I literally have never felt more at home, even at the dives in portland where everyone knows your name.. Keri Ann \"skittles\", kelly, Jason, kim, and whole crew provided the best service that i have experienced in az thus far. Highly recommend this place. Great people, Great environment, and even better food!  Mic drop***"}
{"text":"Ladies Night Thursdays.  Start with the mozzarella sliders,  they are secretly wrapped in won ton wrappers. I enjoyed the amazing prime rib sliders!  Secret ingredient is mayonnaise!"}
{"text":"Bad food bad service, don't pay their bills.Wish you could rate less than one star. Jodie and his daughter  was bad but the partner is a bag of dicks. When you call your staff sluts and run away. You need to quit. Please go out of business so someone can open a decent place there"}
{"text":"There is nothing about this place that is all too appealing for me. It is dingy, dirty, and the restrooms stink. The food seemed to have little care in preparation, as it was less than mediocre, cold, and sloppily plated.   The only saving grace was our wonderful server (who also was insanely overloaded, taking on the entire dining room). She was friendly, informative, and worked hard in keeping us well stocked with ice cold beer."}
{"text":"Finally tagged along with my husband for some football and food on a Sunday after church and although this isn't my cup of tea, I have to say that their service was amazing and their AYCE Breakfast deal is pretty amazing. I was a little skeptical of the quality of the food when I heard that it was all you can eat, but gave it a try and did not regret it.   They have scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, hash brown, potatoes, biscuits and gravy, french toast, regular toast, and English muffins. When I'm craving breakfast food and don't want to drive too far or cook it myself, I am coming back here.   They also have flat screens at every freaking angle possible so you can catch your game here. They also have outdoor seating if you just want to just chat with a friend, away from all the game cheering."}
{"text":"We are renting out the entire golf resort for our family reunion and we decided to come here instead of annebellles. The service was quick and friendly and took only 15 minutes. When it arrived it was hot and fresh and looked great. Both me and my significant other chose wings. He got 1lb bone in and I got one pound bone out with sauce on the side. The mild sauce was awesome and the wings were just heaven. I didn't think I could even eat that much but it was perfect!!!! We live locally so def will be back for wing wednsdays from now on! Excellent waitress too! She was informative and helpful! :)"}
{"text":"Service was atrocious. Absolute nightmare! First waitress avoided our table so I went to the bar after 15 min...then a circus after that! It took 25 minutes to grill chicken that was forgot and I had to go get it. Definitely need some customer service lessons here!"}
{"text":"The Devil is in the details.   We had sliders and draft beers. Prime rib slider with toasted onions and horsey sauce. Delicious!  Burger slider also great.  Ok, the food is sTandcompared to chain places like Applebee's. BUT, those chain places succeed on details. Clean bathrooms, clean condiments, clean floors.  If this place would \"clean up its act\" it could easily rise to a 5 star place. Cute location, outdoor seating, lots of games inside like pool, darts and the like!"}
{"text":"Apparently if your not one of their regular cronies you are put on the bottom of their service no matter how slow it is! While I've  come here from time to time I'm not often recognize its always the same!!! At least the food is meadeaoker.the thing Is can walk here so I keep coming back hoping that I'm going to be surprised.... Well not yet"}
{"text":"Pretzels were excellent and so was the crazy delicious cheese... but when I got to the last slice and discovered no more crazy delicious cheese sauce.. well.. it just hurt. Please give more cheese"}
{"text":"Called before leaving my house to ask if they had the PAC-12 Network. They said yes.  I got there and waited 10 minutes before a server came over to the table that I had sat down at to greet me. I asked for an iced tea, and asked if the TV I was in front of could be changed to the PAC-12 Network.  She disappeared for another 8-10 minutes before coming back with my tea and then told me they didn't have that channel.  I left, and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing service!! Absolutely phenomenal! The food is solid and the menu options are second to none! My family moved here from Denver and have been looking for a good spot to call our own and we have undoubtedly found it here in Mesa Az! Great Karaoke to pass the time and friendly staff. A big shout out to Keriann, Amanda. And Jay! And not to be rude but I can't remember the KJ's name but this place is awesome. It's our own \"Cheers\".    Jeremy Cole"}
{"text":"A cool location with good service and a great online presence. Went for the buy-one-get-one Yelp deal in the afternoon after a hike. We were just about the only ones in there but it didn't mean slow service like similar situations at other restaurants have. Check it out! It's in the back of what otherwise looks like a dumpy shopping center, but its unique location makes up for that.  The food was also good with a great selection of sides and a daily selection of discounts. I'm all about the coups and this place delivered on all fronts. Good food, good deals, good location."}
{"text":"A place with tater tots on the menu is on its way to my heart.  While staying at the Arizona Golf Resort, this place was a walkable dinner after having a nice happy hour in the courtyard of our suite.  Decent selection of beers on tap and a pretty standard bar menu.  One of our party did get mild wings which she found to be too hot, but other than that, all were happy with their selections, and I used my Yelp check in discount to get some tots for all!"}
{"text":"Came in here to watch the Coyotes game and have some appetizers/beer. The sweet waitress had the whole place to cover by herself, they definitely need some additional help. Keep in mind this is a Saturday night. The food/beer was good, and everything was going fine until the second intermission when the bartender turned the ONE television that had the Coyotes game to some game that was playing on 5 other TV's. We're the only people in our section and he didn't bother to realize we've been staring at that TV for an hour and a half before he changed it. Keep in mind they have 15 TV 's on and only ONE of them was on the game we were watching. Not coming back."}
{"text":"The golf cart/security/driver at The Arizona Golf Resort brought us here when Annabelle's was closed. Much more fun and comfortable than Annabelle's, which was a little stuffy for us. Decent beer selection that we hear is soon improving. LOTS of space, and a huge patio that had some fun games on it. I hear the wings are good but unfortunately we weren't hungry! But the highlight was the bartender Leigh. She was super nice and knowledgeable. Had a great time! If we lived in AZ we'd definitely be back."}
{"text":"So this place used to be called, Benchwarmers Grill, but was purchased by Mo and her husband about 6 months ago.  I'm not usually the kind of gal that likes bar food, but really had no choice since my Mesa Chamber of Commerce Networking Group was holding it's meeting there.  The atmosphere is like a typical bar and grill, but the food is far from it.  Yum!  I tried their home made meatloaf and bread pudding, and was pleasantly surprised.  The food was great, the service was great and I would for sure recommend it to anyone living in the area.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here since it opened. I love the food here, and i think its time they name a burger after me. They are also very good about customizing the food for you, my favorites are the burgers and wings and mini sliders and i founded the buffalo chicken sandwhich here. Beer is the same everywhere, but for some reason it tastes like the end of a rainbow and there are tiny leprachauns dancing around a marvelous pot of gold in your MOUTH. They have a bunch of different kinds of beers on tap, i prefer my Coors Light though.  This place has a inviting firendly atmosphere. The bartenders are all great and fast, and they are all friendly.   This place has become my favorite bar thoughout the years. Everyone there including the customers are great. I have made some great friends hanging out there, and evertime i go there its hard to leave because i have such a great time. If your looking for amazing chow and a cold beer in a chill atmosphere On the Green is a spot to try out."}
