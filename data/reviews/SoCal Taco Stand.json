{"text":"Food is pretty bad. I make better tacos at home. ZERO flavor, cheap flour tortillas and standard grocery store ingredients. I tried twice to give this place a try and I just can't do it. The owner is really nice and a great sales person but I just wish he would of put the same effort of upselling his product into his food. The last time I ate there I had to throw it away, it was that disgusting."}
{"text":"The nastiest tacos I have ever tasted, No phone  number on the receipt to call to tell them $12 spent on garbage.Buy at your own risk. I promise , its worse than Jack in the Box tacos. They should be shami to sell thay mess. Pissed to know people eat that and or not warned about it. Their license should be revoked!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! The owner/operator is super friendly, loves his work, and makes great tacos. He kept me entertained the entire time I was at his stand, walking me through all my options. His tacos are bigger than expected and delicious. These are no frills tacos with beef, chicken, and pork options for 3 bucks each."}
{"text":"Simple but solid tacos with a great owner / operator. I highly recommend getting the pork taco but all are good."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the pork taco fully loaded. I come here way too much and I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The owner is so incredibly friendly and his tacos are always amazing... 5 stars all day!"}
{"text":"Very plain tacos, not a lot of a flavor. Honestly, it tastes like tacos that your friend's mom would make (and not in a nostalgic, good way)."}
{"text":"I'm torn on spreading the word about SoCal tacos because I don't like waiting in lines. And this place should absolutely have a line! 

Surprisingly, I prefer the chicken over the pork but both are delicious. He slow cooks the meats which really make them stand out. The other ingredients are basic but not unexpected for a $3 taco. My head knows one is enough to fill me up, but my heart always orders two. Because well, I'm a fat kid at heart. 

Beyond that, Randy is a super friendly guy who enjoys being out meeting people. Stop by and support this small business. And if you can't get over his Seahawks and Warriors fandom - you deserve to eat lesser tacos."}
{"text":"I tried to be a fan of this place, mainly because the owner is such a friendly guy, but food is BAD. The tacos are reminiscent of Taco Bell on a good day. There is no invention or creativity going on here, just your standard ground beef or chicken filling with lettuce, diced tomatoes, Mexican blend grocery store cheese, and sour cream all wrapped up in a wheat tortilla.  Hate to say it, but I don't see this place being around for too much longer unless the owners makes some changes to his offerings."}
{"text":"Food is great, owner is a really good person.
I personally like the chicken taco the best but that's probably just my preference. Already have told plenty of friends about it. Very easy place to go during lunch hour. Always leave with a smile."}
{"text":"Best authentic souther Cali tacos in the south. Randy, the owner/operator, is the perfect side dish to compliment the freshness in the pork, chicken and beef tacos. He warned me that one taco was a nice snack and two would be pushing and 3 would knock me out. I should have listened but I'll suffer happily with a full belly of yummy tacos."}
{"text":"Randy catered an event with his taco wagon for me and all I can say is that he is the best! Friendly, enthusiastic and professional. Tacos are straightforward and delicious. He worked with me to include a vegetarian option and made sure every guest had a great experience. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tacos are absolutely delicious, plenty of topping choices, just enough to keep you satisfied while keeping it simple. You can't beat the price, and the owner is extremely friendly. Will definitely make this a regular thing."}
{"text":"Solid no frills place to grab a quick soft taco uptown. Choices are chicken, beef, and pork. Pork is by far my favorite and you can really taste the difference in how the pork is slow cooked. $3 all in with cheese, lettuce, salsa, and sour cream or ranch. And tax is included! First timers get a free water.  The Seahawks flag is a little sketch in these parts but if you can get over that your tummy will be thanking you."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Randy was actually walking away from the taco stand as I was walking up and he opened back up for me. He was super sweet and made three amazing tacos. I highly recommend SoCal Tacos."}
{"text":"The owner is nice, very talkative, and a crazy lunatic for wearing a Seattle Seahawks hat in this town.  Honestly, his personality boosted my overall opinion of the place because at best,  the food is just okay.  Given that he's parked his truck/stand/food cubicle literally 20 feet away from Salsarita's, I expected a bit more from his offering.

The problem is that the tacos are standard and boring.  Lettuce, Tomato, salsa, sour cream?  I mean really?  I guess if I were a taco stand guy trying to compete with a major taco brand chain restaurant 20 feet away, I'd try some sort of spin or special edition tacos or something.  Some sort of mango chutney salsa with the pork, or some kind of creative chicken taco.  Maybe Wednesdays are fish taco days where you can get extra cilantro on your fried cod taco.  There is literally nothing differentiating his food from his competitor except he lags behind the chain restaurant in his variety of ingredients and offerings.  Want to keep the standard tacos mom used to make on a school night on the menu?  Fine, but at least flank them daily with some sort of show-stopper taco for those of us whose taste buds graduated the 4th grade.  

It's a neat concept, I will give him that, and with some creative offerings, he's got a shot at making it.  I'm just not optimistic given his current menu, average quality and completely unnecessary free-water giveaways."}
