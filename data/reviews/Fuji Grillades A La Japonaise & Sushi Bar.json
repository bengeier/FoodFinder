{"text":"We go to Fuji for what it does best, which is teppan.  We like the show the cook does, and the food is very good as well.  They also have a sushi bar (although it's closed on Mondays), so if you want some sushi, they can accomodate you there as well."}
{"text":"This place reminds of a poor mans Benihana...\"where dinner is the show\". The entrainment factor of watching a chef juggling prawns is over shadowed by the fact the they taste terrible. As another reviewer said its a good idea to go to Fuji if your in a large group mainly for the entertainment factor. Save your money and skip Fuji."}
{"text":"It is fun to see the cook raising the flame in front of you, but other than that no much value. I ordered chicken teriyaki, it was full of skin and fat, they use the cheapest parts of the chicken. the cook was funny but the waitress was not that friendly."}
{"text":"Always fun and entertaining to have the food chopped and cooked right in front of you, with fireballs and all. Cooks could improve their showmanship. The food is great, and for the price, you can't really argue! Great experience."}
