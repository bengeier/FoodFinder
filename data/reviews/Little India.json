{"text":"Worst customer service ever!!! There was a bald man at the counter who was so rude, that I swear that I will never go here again! Even the people in the kitchen are so rude!!"}
{"text":"Awful service.   The man at the counter was very rude. And was preaching to me about how I should live my life. I did not ask for it.   Lots of expired products. Incorrect labelings (weight of dal ). And dals are of very low quality.   I guess cheap food isnt everything. It comes at a cost.   Please spend a few more dollars and go elsewhere for your produce if you can afford it."}
{"text":"We were visiting from San Jose CA where there is an abundance of Indian restaurant ; however, the atmosphere, food and the prices were so great that I wish Little India was in our neighborhood. What made it more appealing was the attitude of Megha and all the ladies in the kitchen. As I am on a restricted diet Megha understood my needs and gave me honest suggestions as to what can be done with least amount of oil."}
{"text":"There was a limited amount of options to chose from in my opinion but there was mango lassi."}
{"text":"Great authentic Indian food. Small family owned place. Quick Service. Indian groceries are also available. Being Indian myself I can tell you that this is the place we head to whenever we crave Indian food especially spicy Indian chaat (street food). The Chole Batura, Mattar Paneer and Bada Pav are must haves."}
{"text":"fabulous food, great price. The ladies who make the food and bring it out are sweet and wonderful people who make me feel like i'm at their house instead of at a restaurant.  If i could change anything it would be the guys at the front- the older gentleman chews tobacco while he's talking to you and sometimes spits, and the younger one- I guess his son- has a serious lack of people skills but i'll put up with both for the goodies that come out of that kitchen- try the vada paav or the gol guppa chaat....yum."}
{"text":"Finally writing a review for this wonderful little place ....  This is where I was first introduced to 'chaat' from my desi friends and fell in love with it.  All the chaat are vegetarian ... but oh they are so good   I honestly cannot speak if it is authentic or not ... but they are certainly yummy with a very reasonable price. One of the mom & pop type of place, they have pictures on the wall for the non native like me to order from ... but the best way yet is bring your indian friends.... you will find plenty of tasty surprise that is not on the picture   The only reason this place is missing a star was that it doesn't feel very neat given it is inside a grocery store and have very few tables ..."}
{"text":"I don't get people who say Little India's food tastes better than the food back home (in India).   Worst \"Chaat/food\" I have had in years. I tried paani puri, paapri chaat, daihi barhay, samosa chat, batura cholay and bhindi masala with chapati. Nothing tasted good.   Paani puri was blah. Paapri chaat and Samosa chaat were just ok. Tandori Times offers tastier chaats (on weekends before 5pm). Dahi Barhay were bad to say the least. Bhindi Masala was just ok. Chapati was horrible.   In my opinion stay away from this place if you really want authentic Indian/Pakistani food. Try the lunch buffet at Copper Kettle (in Mesa, Alma School and Warner) if u like North Indian/Pakistani food or try Tandori Times in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Another of those places where I have been umpteen number of times and only now gotten around to writing the review. This is a place you get the most popular street food of India ( yes we have stuff other than curries) . Go in a big group so you can try many things. Everything is good. It's located inside a grocery store and has limited seating so don't expect anything fancy. Just go there for the food."}
{"text":"Excellent chaat! Dont go by the looks of the place, the food is one of the best around here. They have been very consistent with the quality of the food which is rare for Indian restaurants in the valley. I have tried almost all the chaat items on the menu and have never been disappointed. The gravies that come along with the combo specials are not that great. Their Vada Paav (Indian burger) deserves a special mention. Definitely try the place for a quick and tasty evening snack."}
{"text":"Love this place! Can stop by anytime for a quick bite of your favorite chaats. Very modernly priced and the taste is very good."}
{"text":"This small shop is tucked in corner of a strip mall. The food is not so great, for a person who hasn't tried chaat, they will like it but it's nothing to be excited for.  The samosas were oily and the covering was chewy. The samosa chat lacked some spiciness to it. Same for the kachoris. The place is small and not that easy to see how to order and pay esp. if there are lots of people in the shop already.  As one of the reviewer said, the owner chews tobacco while mumbling and always feels like he is inconvinienced while you pay him cause he gets disturbed from watching his TV!"}
{"text":"It was extremely confusing for me to figure out what to do. Apparently you're supposed to grab a slip by the water cooler and mark down what you want and then hand it to the women cooking in the back. I sat around for like 15 minutes before I went on Yelp and figured out what to do. The food itself was really good, but a bit on the spicy side for my taste. If you like hot food, this place is for you. It was definitely not lacking in flavor. The samosas are excellent as well. I was a little irritated that they don't take debit/credit card for purchases under $10, as the food is very cheap. I had to buy a Cadbury chocolate bar off the shelf in order to make my purchase over $10. Overall, I'd give the food 4 stars, but the service 2 stars. 3 stars on average. Good, but there are better places to go in Tempe."}
{"text":"I'm a non-Indian foodie who has been going here for years; I lived in India for a few years, and can say this is the most pukka, \"for real\" place, with the \"real stuff,\" that I've run into in these parts. I've never seen any discourtesy in all those years--everyone seems friendly to me; don't know what people are looking for or why they're complaining. Food is yummy, prices are great, full of Indos all the time, for me a fun ambiance. Simple as heck to navigate; pictures of stuff on the walls if you don't know what dishes are; then just fill out the yellow slip and give it to one of the ladies. Cheapo and delish.    Ted in Tempe, 15 minutes bike ride away from Little India, thank goodness."}
{"text":"My advice to the owners is that they should separate the snackery from the grocery store.   South Asians flock here for finger licking chaats (N.B: the word 'chaat' literally means 'lick') and Little India serves up some great tangy blends. The seating is a little cramped and the tables are not always cleaned on time but the food hits the spot in a way that makes you want to come back for more.   One important point to note is that none of the items on the menu bring the heat quotient and therefore may also work wonders for foreign taste buds.  This is an Indian place that I sincerely wish could market itself better and make a name for itself in the valley's restaurant scene."}
{"text":"Best authentic Indian food ever. I absolutely love this place! I've never had anything bad ever and it's all reasonably priced. I go here every week (sometimes twice a week) since I moved here 4 months ago and it has always been incredible. If I lived closer I might just eat here everyday... It's my favorite restaurant in AZ. My favorite is the Chole, aloo chaat and the samosas."}
{"text":"NIce fresh food.  Excellent puri, chaat, vada paave, gulab jamoon.  Again Indian food is all about taste. If you want good ambience go else where."}
{"text":"Wow!  Amazing!  The owner's customer service was consistently delightful.  The prices unbeatable.  They sell great indian food for a non-offensive price.  Other Indian restaurants have alot to learn here. Some of my favorite dishes are: Special #2 with Pakoda Kadhi...oh so good, the chapati are perfectly made, pickles are homemade, and the rice pilao is scrumptious! The Samosa Chaat is awesome...honestly they do have some of the best somosas I have had. Aloo Tikki Chaat so good especially if you eat it fresh as opposed to take out (even then it is worth it!) The chai was fresh and unbeatable. Gobi Paratha, yum!  Aloo Paratha, yay!  I could go on and on, but three words sum it up...Value, Authenticity, and Fresh! Enjoy"}
{"text":"I like the food everytime i go there as it's fresh. this time had bad experience with smelly batura. owner didn't give a chance to look at it even after complaining. they will hear more complaints today as the dough itself is not good."}
{"text":"Average food, however the worst part is the customer service.   I'd ordered food, and 'they' missed few items while handing over the packet. My bad, that i didn't check before paying. I reached home and called back reminding them about making the payment and the missing items. To my surprise, the lady who picked the phone started blaming and arguing with me that why did I leave the packet. ..Strange people...   Secondly, I would agree to the review provided by 'Rahul K' , The owner of the shop is a frustrated man, and rough to his customers.  He chews tobacco while mumbling and always feels like he is inconvinienced while you pay him cause he gets disturbed from watching his TV!"}
{"text":"Today I went to little India tempe. The shop is very small and ambiance is not good. The customer service is very worst and the owner is very rude during billing. Please don't prefer to go this indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great take out portions. Have ordered a few times and always satisfied. Good prices too. My new favourite. Lots of vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"I love Indian Food but realized today Little India provided me with my first authentic experience!  Anita at the front counter was super friendly and helped me order because I had no idea what I was doing!  This was, hands down, the best Indian cuisine I've ever had. The Chaat was incredible and special #1 was the perfect introduction to a meal that wasn't Tiika Masala.   If you are vegetarian and looking for some adventurous, tasty, and healthy food this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I went to little india yesterday,the shop smells yucky,the tables were untidy and the owner of the shop was chewing tobacco and spitting on the corner of the shop very often looking at this environment I was not interested to take any chat orders so I purchased few groceries and came to the cash counter I gave my credit card to the cash counter person (tobacco walla)he just throwed my card on the table and said we don't accept this card in a very higher tone i was verymuch shocked upon his behavior where I felt like throwing the groceries on his face and walk out,but I controlled myself paid some cash and came out I doubt who gave licence for this shop,it is not a communication problem because I m an indian I can communicate very well with that people, people who go to eat chatts r attracted by their low price but never forget the food u eat should not only taste good it should not cause any digestive problems .even if u get me a rubber sheet I will heat that and throw some Indian spices on it and give u a yummy chatt,so pls don't look only for the taste and lowest price which is good for nothing I rate zero"}
{"text":"Worse sweet (especially ladu) I have ever tasted and the customer service is horrible.. DISAPPONTING"}
{"text":"The food might be good... But I would appreciate if the man at the cash were better mannered with customers... He seems to think he is doing charity by accepting credit cards instead of cash.. Go to this place if you don't mind being treated rudely by the owner.."}
{"text":"Good place for chat. I take my family almost twice in a month for Gol gappa chat and Chole Bahturey.  They also serve thaali which is kind of good. And also love the shopping grocery.  Space is little less but as there name suggest Little India i don't mind that. Most of the the time it's just the same chat bhandar, would love to see some more dishes added to the menu like allo Patties, Crunchy Poha, Upma."}
{"text":"The food here is great that I had to write a review. I got the butter chicken, goat and coconut rice with some garlic naan. Perfect amount of flavour. The mango lassi tastes great too! My new fav spot."}
{"text":"Excellent value for money Great pooris and sabzi - very authentic north Indian  When my mom was visiting me in the States, we went here almost every day."}
{"text":"Chat is very good. Try samosa and bada pav."}
{"text":"So Affordable!  This place is delicious and the servings are the perfect size. I let them know I'm vegan and they make sure to not include any dairy or eggs in my meals. They are very accommodating. This is what I imagine to be a very authentic Indian market that serves wonderful food. I have been here many times and am never disappointed! They also claim to have the BEST Samosas in the United States and I have to admit they are pretty good!"}
{"text":"Grocery wise oki. But didnt find any vegetables here.frozen vegetables and food is minimal. Chaat corner is nice. For minimal amount its worth a shot.seeing lot of families on friday"}
{"text":"The food is good BUT the person at the Till is horrible. Doesn't know how to speak and deal with customers. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE BY THE OWNER!!"}
{"text":"By far the best place for indian chaat in phoenix area. it's no frills deal, food is made to order. 'i've never had a bad experience and make it there at least once a month for past several years."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant in Arizona. Seating is limited as it's inside a grocery store. The food, however, is amazing! I find the food here to have the closest taste to that from my city of childhood - Mumbai, India. Almost everything here is delicious. If you're looking forward to have a full meal, I would recommend ordering Chole & Bhature / Parathas / full dishes with Pulao. What I come here for is Bada Paav, the AZ equivalent of Maharashtra  Vada Paav. Little India is truly little India!"}
{"text":"I love this hole in the wall! It feels awkward because you have to match pictures to the order sheet and awkwardly hand the sheet to somebody in the kitchen. Later, you have to figure out what they handed you and what you ordered!"}
{"text":"I was mislead by another review type website that led me to believe this was the best Indian food in North Calgary.  I ordered the butter chicken and beef vindaloo and I didn't think I had to take out my fishing rod to fish for the limited amount of meat in both dishes.  The containers are large, but mostly full of sauce, and at a price of $12.99, you expect a better balance of meat in the dish.  The garlic naan and coconut rice dishes were reasonable priced and good tasting.  Of the three Indian restaurants that I have eaten at so far in North Calgary, Little Indian ranks last, and will also be the last time I eat here."}
{"text":"Good Indian chats! I would recommend the Samosa ragda. The prices are reasonable for the food. Not so reasonable for the groceries. The ambiance isn't anything special but they have all the bare minimums to let one sit and eat.  The grocery store is part of this eatery and has a decent selection of Indian snacks and other stuff one would expect to find at an indian grocery. The only drawback is the non-availability of fresh Indian vegetables. They do have frozen vegetables though. Oh, and I almost forgot, they sell excellent Samosas that come with mint and tamarind chutneys for just a dollar apiece. The closest competitor I can think of is India Plaza, they sell the same sized Samosas that taste okay for $1.29 but don't offer the mint and tamarind chutneys."}
{"text":"First timers: head to the back and fill out a menu, and hand it to the nice people who are making the food. The lack of signage seems to trip everyone up.  This place is hidden in the back of the Indian grocery store. This is actually fairly standard for chaat (i.e. snack) places in the U.S. Some might have more seating, some don't have the grocery store attached, but they all have delicious, mouth-watering food at decent prices.  For me, this place is hit-or-miss. Sometimes the bhel-puri is out-of-this-world, and other days it isn't even worth finishing. That's basically what turned me from a repeat customer to I'm-never-going-back. For the quality+quantity of food you get, I can't say that the price is that great, I've had way better food for way cheaper, with just about the same level and speed of service, elsewhere. Sadly, this is about the best you'll find in Tempe (for chaat, I mean).  I'll give them props for having decent pani-puri and for showing the 'rents a good time when they were here. Oh yeah, sometimes the owner or the person at the front desk is a real... grouch, to put it nicely. Not really my business (or is it??) but maybe people should learn not to glare as a routine.  Oh yeah, and their prices seem to fluctuate based on how much you spend and what you buy. I want to say this is typical of Indian grocery in the U.S. but most places are really nice and don't try to rip you."}
{"text":"Before having my first Bollywood-in-a-theatre experience in good ol' Tempe, I ended up here at Little India upon the recommendation of one of my colleagues.   Little India, like many Indian shops in the Valley, also moonlights as a chaat house. \"Chaat\" is basically snack food - dozens of different dishes, all with a bit of a kick and real tasty (it's hard to screw up chaat, and if you do, then you REALLY suck and shouldn't be in business).   At L.I., you go to the back of the store, pick up a slip which is printed out sushi-order style, pick what you want, and hand it through the open door to one of the girls scampering around in the kitchen. None of the dishes is more than 5 bucks (the majority being below $3), all of them vegetarian (which doesn't mean healthy, but whatever). It was 8:30 or so, and I hadn't eaten since lunchtime, and I'd worked out, so I was starvin' like Marvinder.  I ordered the pav bhaji (curried potato dish with a bun - think of it as a Sloppy Joldeep), the puri chaat (hollowed thin dumplings filled with tamarind chutney, mint chutney, yogurt, chopped onions & cilantro, and other spices), and the chole bhatura (warm bowl of spicy garbanzo beans with what I can only describe is REAL Indian fry bread). So, well, not a healthy dinner, but I've been doing so well all year (almost three weeks long) that I thought I could indulge this night.  Seating is limited here. You gotta remember you're in a grocery mart moonlighting as a snack house. Weekends can get really busy as the local Indian community fills in for some pre-Bollywood grubbin'. Water was self-serve with a stack of puny Dixie Cups next to a cooler (to be fair, there are fridges stacked with soda, etc).   We waited for about 5 minutes before we got a table. Once we sat down, the food quickly appeared. All my dishes before me, I didn't even know where to begin. It was a LOT of food. I started tackling each of them, and they were all great: really tasty, aromatic, and mouthwatering, albeit maybe I'm feeling nostalgic for mom's food, but still. Good stuff all around. I enjoyed my meal - the three dishes together equaled $10 plus change, and I was about to burst (and I can shovel in a ton of food before saying mercy).  So this chaat factory in the back I'd give 4 stars, but the place as a whole I'd give 3, as the selection of goods in the store part isn't nearly as plentiful as some other places in the Valley. That said, if I ever find myself on the corner of McClintock & Baseline again for whatever reason, I know my salivary glands will lead me here once again. And again. And again."}
{"text":"I grew up in San Jose in an area where there was a decent Indian population (lots of good Indian food spots) and moving out here to AZ I was worried if I was going to find good some Samosas or Chana Batura. Little India is a tiny Indian supermarket in a Plaza with a small kitchen in the back. You check on a list of what you foods you'd like and hand it over to the cook in the back. There are tables and chairs inside the tiny market so you can enjoy the Indian supermarket atmosphere while you're eating. I recommend the Samosas and Chana Batura. Reasonably priced. While I am not an expert on Indian food- all I can say is I left happy and satisfied. Hole-in-the-wall Indian food for the win!"}
{"text":"I've waited to review Little India for SO long... mostly because I'm not sure exactly what to write to do it justice. First and foremost, this is an Indian grocery store. But, behind all its masalas and rice flakes, Little India has a family-operated snack business going on. Six or seven little tables in the back are there for people to order and eat their chaat, which is basically Indian street food. The first time came here, I expected typical Indian-restaurant fare. Don't. This is completely different. The list you can order from is small snacks, most of which include fried snack pieces, chutneys and yogurt. It's exactly what you will get if you find street snacks on the beaches in India. And it's delicious. It's not healthy, or light, but it's yummy.  I have friends from other cities, like Miami, who say they can't find anything like this in their cities. So Phoenix, consider yourself lucky!  And go to Little India. Order their samosa chaat (a smooshed samosa with sauces and spices) and a bada pav ( a spicy, spicy \"veggie burger\" made of potato and spices in between a bun, spread with chutney) and some parathas (handmade Indian 'tortillas,' stuffed with things like radish, or potato or fenugreek).  And it's cheap!"}
{"text":"The papri chaat is my favorite. Love the samosas and chai. It's all authentic, fresh and delicious. Buy tea there too, Red Label loose leaf and P C Tip bags. Also, a great selection of fresh and frozen chapati, naan, paratha and roti. Papa sums, too."}
{"text":"I am mainly doing this as the old man at the front desk has been growing more and more unfriendly lately.   He does not even care to give customers credit card receipts with payment. You probably have to ask for it every time, seems like he is saving paper (read penny pinching).  Very arrogant about the quality of groceries sold at his store, ask him about the quality and you will know.  Plus he has some real ill-will for AMEX guys in case if you ever care to check whether you can use your AMEX card. In my case he went on for a 5 minute rant.  Food quality at the fast food place is great, no complaints."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out because of the new owners!  I had a very negative experience with curry in a hurry!  We had the dinner for 4 but added the paneer butter masala!  The paneer was excellent, the curried veggies were tasty as well!  We also really enjoyed the naan bread and the pakora!  The desert was missing from our order but I didn't mind as I'm not a huge Indian sweet lover!  I wasn't overly excited about the butter chicken!  I found it very bland in comparison to the other richly flavoured items and we had to add our own spices!"}
{"text":"The food in this place was fantastic. I was cautious after reading some google reviews but the food was home cooked and yummy. I loved the chat too. My parents loved the food too and that's saying a lot given my mom and dad are super foodies from India. Great value for the money too."}
{"text":"Don't let this simple hidden treasure keep you from coming here. This is tucked in a grocery store with authentic spices and cooking for an affordable meal! It's like having street eats! :) You just grab one of the yellow sheets and mark what you want and then leave it in the basket. The staff will take the order while you sit. Sip on some water while waiting.  The last time I came here I ordered the Aloo Tikki Chaat. This is vegetarian dish made of the  Tikki (potato patty) made of potatoes, green chili, corn flour, lentils, chili powder and other spices) served with chopped onions, green chutney (spicy sauce), tamarind chutney (sweet sauce) and yogurt. I also ordered Special #1:  rice pulao (mixed veggie rice), bhatura (equivalent to a Mexican tortilla), matar paneer (cheese-like curds) and pickle (pickled veggies that probably the inexperienced palate will not be able to master).   These dishes have so many flavors!! Give it a try! :)  Updated because I heard that some of the grocery items were expired! Restaurant food is good though."}
{"text":"Here is a honest review from an Indian Tempe veteran !  This review was long overdue but finally its here. I don't know where to start on this place. As one person mentioned below this place is like run down has barely 4 tables with plastic chairs and always dirty tables surrounded by 3 isles of groceries facing kitchen and toilet. No one ever comes to take your order and you have to grab a menu item list and fill what you want and go to the kitchen to hand them what you need and people from the kitchen giving you weird looks as if we are forcing them to cook food for us. I have been to this place when i was the only customer and still took a long time for them to serve. Often the next 3 orders are served before you so that you look stupid waiting there.  Regarding food , they serve in paper plates, get your own water in paper cups and food is less quantity and not so tasty. They barely make efforts to cook great food. The paneer mutter has 2 minute cubes of paneer and loads of green peas and the curry is tasteless. Chole bhature is bad too and their so called \"veg pulao\" is nothing but yellow rice with cumins seeds and not even close to be called a pulao. This is what they serve for 6$. Thinking about snacks their paani puri has 6 old stocked puris and paani(sweet water and green water) which is not so authentic plus they serve samosa potato filling as stuffing which is fooling people who dont know what paani puri is. Their other snacks i did not try but from what my friends ordered were equally bad. Their quantities are bad too. But their samosas are decent not as bad.Their kitchen has the owner wife and other exploited less wage paid women working with whom you have a hard time communicating. i observed they sometimes keep some basic food items like pickles, tomato purees, paneer mutter left over and etc inside refrigerators for use when needed. GREAT serve us stale food.  Their grocery store stocks all expired and smelly stuff which is not overpriced than other indian grocery stores. I bought groceries just because they refuse to take credit card below 10$ and they hate AMEX. Once i asked the paan eating owner that the item is expired and instead of being polite he said \"you should pick and choose items correctly\". I bought some snacks which had a stored smell and the pohas(flatten rice) was not good quality(confirmation from indian parents visiting). The grocery store is a risk as you can end up messing up your stomach.  My final advice to people with the intent of going here for lunch/snacks/dinner is good luck to get served mediocre food and some of my indian friends will agree to this. Grocery store definitely there are other places to go ask your fellow indian friends. Also i can't tolerate the owner who always chew paan and talks weird to you."}
{"text":"Worst indian food by far. We went there for chaat  and the place was so dirty and cramped up in a tiny grocery store. There was hardly any place to breathe. People who appreciate it probably haven't tasted authentic indian food yet. chaat was below average. Vada pav was nothing close to actual vada pav. I threw up as soon as I got home. Worst was chole.bhatura was still bearable but chole tasted like crap. Disgusting place with horrible customer experience.  I would never go back."}
{"text":"The most amazing chaat I have had in a long time. Go for aloo tikki and samosa chat!"}
{"text":"There is no true Chaat(snacks) house in Phoenix but this is the closest thing. There are a lot of other establishments that are trying to take a cut out of this latest Indian Chaat craze like Tandoor Times and Woodlands but this is as real as it gets until someone moves here and opens a legitimate Chaat house.  All of the food is vegetarian. This is the Indian version of tapas with fried vegetarian food. Yes, it's delcisous.  Yes, you wil want to take a nap when you leave. Their samosa chaat, kachori and chole batura are excellent.  The paratha can vary. Sometimes it's perfect and other times it's greasy.  Honestly, I have no complaints about the food. The prices are extremely reasonable. You can eat a full meal for $10.  The downside is obvious....it's in a Grocery Store.  There are tables in this family owned Indian grocery store.  They decided to serve chaat one day and put out some plastic tables That's what this is.  Hopefully, they can make enough money to open a full fledged, full time chaat store."}
{"text":"Awesome samosas and kachoris!! We ordered roti and sabji as well. Chapati and matar paneer was ok not so good.  In all great for snacks :)"}
{"text":"Let me list my qualifications first - I have lived (not just visited) in six different states in different parts of India, I have traveled extensively and tried Indian restaurants in 15-20 states in the US and, finally, I have tried 10-20 Indian restaurants in the Valley.   This place is strictly mediocre and chats (snacks) here, that everyone seems to be raving about, are made from out-of-box stuff. They lack freshness, flavor complexity, and are largely monotone, primarily of tamarind chutney. Kachori, for instance, is a sad imitation of a real Kachori which is typically crisp and with some filling. The menu is very limited and, for the quality of food and ambience, is overpriced for a self-serve corner eatery tucked inside a grocery store.   Finally, the owner at the front is indifferent at his best and rude if he has to talk to you. Servers, however, are efficient and courteous and they earn one star."}
{"text":"YUM! Having grown up in the Middle East in the Sultanate of Oman during my formative years, I grew up eating Indian cuisine and snacks since it was readily available in grocery stores and Indian restaurants throughout the capital, Muscat. Muscat, Oman has an Indian expat population of more than 300K so Indian food in Muscat is like Mexican food is here in Phoenix, it's just part of the culture. Anywho, ever since moving back to Phoenix for college, I've always craved some good samosas and cheap chaat.   Little India provides that with their spicy samosas, their delectable chaat, all at low prices. Whenever I have a craving for a samosa, I can't resist the temptation of just buying one, I usually walk out the store with two, three or sometimes 4 samosas to go. Their samosas remind of the ones I used to buy at the Spinney's Supermarket in Muscat. They're  plump filled with potato, peas, carrots, and curry powder or whatever the spice is in it, and it has a kick. Although in Oman you could get chicken, mutton, or veg samosas. But it's cool with me that it's veg, nothing wrong with that! I've only gone for the snacks at Little India and have never gone grocery shopping at the store, so if you're looking for some chaat I recommend you stop by and try it out, it'll be worth your time!"}
{"text":"I just visited Little India for the first time! It was great! Initially I thought I was walking into an Indian grocery store, however after seeing the tables in the back and the pictures of food on the walls, I knew I was in the rig place.  I found out that Little India is a vegetarian resturant so, not really knowing what to order I decided to pick a little of everything on the menu to see what I liked.  The modest pricing allowed me to order 9 dishes 2 combo plates and 2 beverages for about $40. Some of my favorites were the Mixed Chatt which was a great combination of strong flavored with a little spiciness.  The Bhindi Masala was an okra dish that went well with the bread served with one of the combos.  The Mango pickle that was on almost every plate was strong and amazingly flavorful, but also quite strong.  I always suggest that people try new things at least once, so give it a shot and see if it works for you.  The lentils with spinach and the Matar Paneer were both very tasty and also went well with the flatbread.  Finally, my favorite was a small dish called Dhokla which was a light and fluffy yellow bread which came with an amazing green dipping sauce; the sweetness of the yellow bread was a great complement to the green dipping sauce.  The only dish that I didn't really care for was the Pani Puri, which was a small hard puffed pastry with a thin dipping sauce that had the taste of raw egg.  If you are a fan of Indian food, a wide array of flavors, and if your low on cash I highly recommend Little India in Tempe (^_^)"}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best food in Arizona. We come here almost once a week and sometimes everyday."}
{"text":"This place is really small as well as the portions, the owner is very rude, the kitchen very dirty, they will take up to 30 min to get your order ready, and sometimes they won't even call your order making you wait longer in line.you will think you will be getting a deal for the price but when you get your plate you will get disappointed . And if you will talk to the boss about all your complaints, he will just say something like sorry but that's just the way it is. Please don't waste your money or time!"}
{"text":"Absolutely 'The' place to to enjoy 'chaats' ... can not get more authenticated than what you get here... not even in India (overall menu options could be more in any chaat place in India though)... grocery part of it is not bad at all... almost everything I have ever seen here in the store is fresh (unlike some other Indian grocery stores around here) and variety  is awesome... there are some things that you can get only at this place and nowhere else esp if thats related to different festivals/celebrations... items other than chaats like Chole Bhature, parathaas etc. are yum too... and you get Thumbs Up here 12 months a year ! ... ahhhhh....  Overall, a very good place for vegetarian Indian food and groceries..."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and had no clue about what I was ordering. The gentleman at the cash register told me everything was vegetarian and recommended everything because everything was delicious. So, I ordered a few different things and everything was great. A little too spicy cause I get bad acid reflux but it was a risk I was willing to take for good indian food."}
{"text":"I had dinner here Saturday September 1, 2012.  I've had dinner here before but this time I was on my own.  I can't tell you what I had (I'm not being a smart ass, I'm serious) but it was good.  We had something that looked like chili beans, another that looked like green peas and another that looked like lentils.  The kitchen staff picked out our food which turned out to be great as all of it was good - it came out delicious, fast, fresh and hot, but don't expect a smile when it gets there.  The value is outstanding.  The ambiance is simple and competitive when it comes to getting a seat at a table.  And finally, the service is efficient but not so friendly but it doesn't matter, the food is good and it's affordable."}
{"text":"I sort of wandered in the other night.  Wife was out of town and I felt too lazy to cook.  I talked with the a fore-mentioned \"Grumpy Guy\" and explained that I knew nothing about Indian food.  Although he appeared grumpy at first, I sensed a glimmer in his eye as he directed me through the menu making suggestions.  By the time I left we made a connection.  He's not a handsome 25 year old millennial waiting for his next 'Bollywood\" role, but I got a kick out of him.  The ladies in the kitchen were all very polite, and I really enjoyed the food.  I much prefer a small, family-run operation such as this and will go back again."}
{"text":"Their pani puri is tasty.   I like their mater paneer with bhatura.  The mater paneer is comfort food and the bhatura texture perfect.  Love their mango lassi!  I love this place for excellent authentic Indian chaat.  They sure know how to cook."}
{"text":"Take it from a real live Indian who used to live in New Delhi: this is the best, most authentic, just like mom makes it food in phoenix. And the groceries are good too - this is one of the few places in the Valley I can get a Thums Up (if you don't know what that is, you best find out!!).  Great selection of namkeen (salty snacks) and decent fresh asian veggie section (kerela, persian cucumbers, daikon, the works). I love going there, pickin up my faves, and having a quick bhel puri. :)   Yes, all these things I have mentioned above may not be the mainstream type of thing, but seriously, TRY THEM OUT! You're missing out if you don't!"}
{"text":"Although primarily a grocery store, it has a very nice snack corner. Service is not prompt but then its small and busy, if looking for a nice place to have  samosa chaat ,this place is ideal."}
{"text":"Great, flavor, Great Value, Great selection with an interesting format.  Go up to the water cooler, grab a cup of water and a sushi style menu and pick out some chatt. Don't forget to look at the specials board or you may have regrests like I did.  We had a mixed chatt, which was a little of everything in salty, sour, crunchy, starchy, creamy, spicy flavor firecracker mix. all for $3.49  I could not resist the Chole Baturah, fired bread with garbanzo beans in a masala sauce and fresh onion. The bread was soft and crisp with out being greasy. And again the flavors were extremely vibrant.   We also had bada paav which is served like a burger, but it is an Indian flavored poto kanish in bread, paleo dieters be ware.  This is not the best 1st date place, but a great place to show your local knowledge and adventure as you are sitting in the aisles of a grocery store and may have some one picking out items over you table. Not to worry every one is very friendly.  Everything here is vegetarian and it is not hard to even be vegan."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in the door you read a little piece of paper stuck to the counter that reads \" Best Samosas in the USA\" and I kid you not, the samosas are THAT good. All the chats are really good. I went there with a friend whom I met after years and between the two of us we ordered 11 items. We binged and hogged like crazy. Really good food."}
{"text":"I cannot recall the number of times I have been here. But, it sure has been a lot. The food here is slightly inconsistent at times, but mostly really good. I wish the owners had thought about expanding the place, as it is too cramped right now. Absolutely love the chole bhature. This is the most authentic chole bhature you can find anywhere in Tempe. The only problem with this establishment is the staff at the counter. I always find them a bit rude and disinterested in customer service."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed at the service and the quality of food in terms of flavor. Everything we had, samosa chat, Chana bhatoora, aloo, puri was tasteless and substandard in flavor profiles. I had to throw my food away at the end because no one wanted to eat it. And the attitude of the people is also very indifferent so why would I go there again?  I will make my Own chaat at home ten times better than what I was served!"}
{"text":"Chaats are really nice. Great place to go for Indian snacks. A little bit congested though."}
{"text":"Man this is place not so good, but I can't stop going. Any dish you pick, it's under $4 and it's not cooked to perfection but I love them all.  I would have visited this place like 20 times now, yes I order the same things every time I go and I can't get over it. Totally worth a try and best place to start if you wanna try out Indian chaats. Things you buy off the rack are lil costlier compared to other asain super markets."}
{"text":"The food is tasty, especially the samosas and chaat.  Small place inside an Indian grocery store.  Have done catering from them."}
{"text":"Met up with Helen Y for something new, Indian street food (Chaat). She has a great knowledge about ethnic foods and what they are so I knew this was going to be great fun!   We ordered just about 1 of everything off the menu.. as the plates kept coming and coming it was clear that you could order one preparation of a dish and have the several looking and tasting very very similar. While very tasty many were allot alike.   A real disappointment for me was the paratha.. it was extremely greasy and not very flavorful. I'm not sure if perhaps its a regional thing but I'm accustomed to something a bit lighter and slightly flaky. There was this other bread that reminded me of Indian Fry Bread (bhature), was so tasty! I would go back just for that alone!  This was another great experience with Helen Y and her amazing taste! Looking forward to going back but not ordering as much now that I know sort of whats what.   It's been hours and Im still full!!"}
{"text":"I ordered their chaat, pani-puri, mutter-paneer and roti. The pani-puri was expensive as the dish had only 5 puris!! The chaat was okay because it was a bit bland. The mutter-paneer had exactly two pieces of paneer and too many peas and the curry was too watery and bland, very simply it was Yuck!!  Rude staff, bad food and expensive dishes are the highlight of this place. Never going to this place ever again."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on the food served in the quaint little back kitchen area. First off, props to all the female workers in the back kitchen putting out great food. We had the pani puri, samosa chaat, dhokla, methi paratha, and choley bhatura. The pani puri was super flavorful, though the pani was really spicy. If you like spice, you'll love it! The samosa chaat was also really well made and quite well balanced in terms of flavor. I didn't personally get to taste the dhokla, but my friend seemed to love it. Choley bhatura came with two giant bhaturas and a good portion of choley on the side. It was very filling in terms of portion and tasted pretty good overall. Now, you should know that they make their methi parathas by hand. They were just so tasty! The methi paratha came with a side of pickle and yogurt.  I have to admit I was super confused about how to order when I first walked in. You essentially go pick up a blue slip located next to the water and mark what you would like to order. Then you give the slip to someone in the back kitchen and they will bring your food out. After you're done eating, you go and pay at the front. The women in the back kitchen were very nice and really accommodating about our orders. I can't really comment on the owner at the front because he just rang our bill up without ever saying anything.  Overall, this place has GREAT food and is definitely the place to go for Indian dishes."}
{"text":"The only way this place could be more authentic is if they didn't speak English. Picture plastic tables and paper plates in a musty corner of a crowded grocery store smelling of curries and spices. You literally have to walk into the kitchen populated with disgruntled barefoot women cooking at breakneck speeds to hand them your ticket. The food is inexpensive, but delicious. Unfortunately, I wish I knew more about Indian food because there is no explanation as to what any of the menu items are, and the employees raised their eyebrows when I asked. I just asked for the ones that I felt I had a shot at pronouncing. Good choices.  If nothing else sells you, know that the place is constantly crowded with Indians. They seem to like it, so it's gotta be authentic."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's a fun little adventure to eat here. Everything is so reasonably priced and most things are really good. We ordered several items to try food we hadn't had before. Some we liked, a few we didn't. Can't complain when we got like 6 different things for about $15. This was our second visit and we will be back. The ladies in the kitchen are really friendly and the grocery has some good stuff too. It's a little confusing at first but that's part of the adventure. Chill out and enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"On a self directed tour of Desi grocery stores near campus, pleasantly surprised to find a clearly well loved mixed use space, part grocery, part fresh kitchen churning out Anti made goodies at affordable prices. While little, the back eatery was packed, a steady hum of Hindi and an enclave of first generation faces happy to be in a familiar and tasty context. Prices here competitive, selection in grocery more extensive than expected for a compact store, can also get India West newspaper here. Good food, homecoming vibes, and fun attitudes (sign above kulfi case reads \"Best Samosa in America.\").  I read the sign aloud and a fellow desi customer checking out turned to me and said, it's true, you should try it. So my husband and I made sure to visit the kitchen, and I'm so glad we did; bhindi masala, dhokla, samosas, all for around $7. Anti made, Anti approved."}
{"text":"Recently visited this place with my wife after a long time. Ordered chaat, Bhindi, and Daal Palak. Let me just start by saying this, if you want cheap, quick, non authentic out of the package food then this is your haven. Theres no real cooking here. Dirty tables. Half the employees dont speak english. Dont get me started on the restroom. You feel more dirty coming out of the bathroom even after washing your hands. Least they can do is clean up the restrooms. Oh well, Lets move on to the food. Bhindi was raw and hard. No spices what so ever. Daal Palak had 4 leaves of palak. Why call it daal palak, just say daal.   Papdi chaat is out of the box and doesnt taste good.   Worst part about the experience is their customer service. Rude, no gratitude what so ever. I dont understand how can they even be in business for so long with this kind of service? Or its just as Desis we dont expect service?"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure!  The chaat is delicious and you can't beat the prices!"}
{"text":"samaos are great and only $1 each. Its a small place but they have a great little grocery and resturant. I also tried the special number one which was really good. The guy who owns it it very friendly and helpful. Its definitely a perk to have this spot in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The best Chat in Phoenix !! Food is good and cheap !   One negative is the guy in the counter (who chew pan ALWAYS) is not the friendliest person  But food is awesome"}
{"text":"Best Indian food ever!! It's all vegetarian and homemade. Love this place and would recommend!"}
{"text":"The restaurant in the back of the store is great. I go at least once every other week. I am pretty familiar with Indian food but found I had to Google quite a few of the items on the menu. One time I had fairly slow service, but otherwise have been happy."}
{"text":"I'm always hankering for some serious Indian food.  I grew up on it and miss it so.  After hiking 13 miles in the Superstitions, the only thing I wanted was some tasty Indian.  I'm glad we ended up here as it felt so close to home.  I enjoyed a variety of tastings including the paneer paratha (a thin bread filled with cheese), as well as mattar paneer (peas and cheese) with some vegetable rice.  It was flavorful and satisfying.  The affordability of the restaurant options made it so we could have a great sampling of a lot of items.  I'm sure I'll be back when I'm feeling like eating something close to the food I grew up on.  I'm also sure that I'll be adding the fifth star in no time!"}
{"text":"Best chaat and veg. Indian food in Phoenix for really low prices!  The ordering system is a little weird (you fill out a form and bring it into the kitchen) but you can order over the phone and the food will be ready for you.    I would give them 5 stars but its a messy store and they don't have any meat options for carnivores like me.  Be sure to try their desserts as well!  I recommend bringing an Indian friend along to help with ordering."}
{"text":"In the mood for a little snack? this is the place. Don't remember what I ordered (my indian friend helped me), but it was good! and also try desserts!!"}
{"text":"Little Indian grocery bodega. I was here to pick up a dozen samosas I called in. Ended up grabbing a jar of vindaloo as well. The 'kitchen' in the back makes me wonder if they are operating without a license? Was very odd"}
{"text":"I like the small chat plates they have. Not a very good place for all your Indian groceries. But the restaurant in the back has the best chat compared to any other place nearby."}
{"text":"This is a little store with a kitchen on the back. They have the best Samosas in town, the samosas are crispy, fried to order and always good. The place can get crowded during peak hours, so be patient. It has a small kitchen so they take some time to make the food. They make really good chaat, so if you are looking for a good samosa chaat this is your place."}
{"text":"Food: 4.5 stars Everything else: 2 stars   I walked in and was so confused. I had no idea how to order food. Apparently you grab a slip (which took me a while to find) that's next to the water cooler and give it to one of the ladies working in the kitchen. When I went to give it to her I got a good look at the kitchen and it is super clean. The lady who took the slip was super nice so no complaints there. There are only about 5 tables so takeout was a good choice.  I ordered the mattar paneer (pea and cheese curry) for $2.79 and a samosa for $1. Food came out insanely fast and I loved shopping for groceries while I waited. I didn't get too far into the groceries but they pretty much have everything you'd need for Indian cuisine.   When checking out the cashier wasn't really rude but definitely not friendly. He didn't say a thing to me the whole time but I can overlook that.   The food was really good. The little sign (see pictures) said that they have the best samosa in America. Now I'm not sure about that but it was probably the best samosa I've had in Phoenix. Most samosas I've had are too doughy. The samosa here was perfectly fried and the dough was closer to a pastry; it was so flaky. I would definitely get it again. The chutney was good too. It almost tastes like they combined the traditional mint and tamarind chutney into one delicious sauce- sweet, fresh, rich, and tangy. A perfect sauce for the samosa. The curry was super tasty and pretty spicy which I love. My only complaint was that the curry was way greasy. The pool of oil on top was a turn off but worth getting through for how good the curry was.   I would definitely recommend this place for fast and light Indian food. I hate that when I usually want Indian food I either have to gorge myself on a buffet or spend a lot on individual dishes. At little India I can get just as much food as I need and at a price that cannot beat. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"FOOD IS AWESOME! It is actually a small snackshop-like place in a grocery store.  PROS:   - Food is tasty, authentic   - Prices are good   - Lots of options   - Fast and hot   - Ordering is simplistic, filled out in a piece of paper  CONS:   - Small, seating is limited   - Owners (old guy and his son) at the counter are always chewing tobacco and moody   - The use and throw cutlery is a bit cheapo, but hygienic"}
{"text":"Very casual, delicious food in a grocery store/restaurant. Fill out the menu checklist and hand it over to the ladies in the kitchen. We were brought the wrong food, but I didn't care or know better. It was delicious."}
{"text":"Authentic indian snack foods.   The paav bhaji is \"2 lightly buttered and grilled paavs served with mass spiced mix vegetable with red curry.\" The \"paavs\" are literally buttered hamburger buns. The curry had a strong tomato flavor.  The panipuri was yummy but did not provide enough potato,veggies to stuff in the puris.  Mango lassi's are delicious!   Overall, customer service was not the best. Felt unwelcome from the male owner, but his wife is a sweetheart!"}
{"text":"While the snacks and food may be good, the customer service is not. A little boy went to get plates for his family, when one of the head cooks in the kitchen came out and yelled at him and the family for taking additional plates. The amount of professionalism was lacking and I would have liked to see this situation handled better."}
{"text":"There are many favorites here. The wada pavs, Puri Chaat and Chole Bhature are great. The other dishes are good too. Groceries are expensive but if you want to walk in and walk out, its an ideal place. Remember, if you pay in cash here you can avoid the sales tax."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Delicious home cooking for a great price. If  you go in with lower expectations (i.e. know that it's in the back of store) you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I finally went here for lunch and it was fantastic.  I was kind of lost upon entering because it was like a small grocery store, but I did read reviews and have heard from friends of the layout so I expected it, and went to the back of the store where the kitchen was.  There is a board with the daily special.  You take a slip and write down what you want to order and then hand it over to the kitchen staff.  I had a mango shake that was so gorgeous.  it wasn't super frozen, you can taste some yogurt in it, and it was naturally sweet from the fruit.  The samosa came next.  It was served with a tamarind chutney that was just amazing sweet and tart and spicy.  I was pretty much done after the shake and the samosa, but my lunch was yet to come.  It was a plate of pilou, pickles, bread, yogurt, and a bowl of yellow lentils.  It was so filling!  the textures of each of the items complemented each other, and the tastes mingled in your mouth so well.  I ordered two more samosas to take away with me!  My rec is to go with friends and create your own buffet lunch at your table by ordering a variety of curries, lentils, soups, and breads. Don't forget the mango shake!"}
{"text":"I recently made a catering order here.Snd was pretty happy with their food . We got mirchi bajji, dhokla, Samosa , dum aloo and biriyani.Everything was spot on and reasonable price."}
{"text":"Quaint little store tucked in Baseline road, Tempe. They have very limited groceries and God forbid if you ask them about a product they do not have. The cranky old man will give you a good 15 minute talk on supply chain management, how difficult it is to get things from India and how he only has the best brands and the one you're looking for is basically crap.  The store also has a little restaurant inside with a few cramped up tables where they serve a good selection of vegetarian food mainly meals/thali , samosas,chaat,kachori etc.The food itself is great and reasonably priced but I dread going to the store because of their customer service.  They are just outright rude and don't have a care in the world.Also they will not accept AMEX, he did go on to tell the husband that one should not be using such cards (Whatever that meant).  If you happen to find yourself in Little India pray the owner spares you.Don't even think about getting a receipt.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Charged 25 bucks to get frozen vada pav and samosa to go. On complaining the ladies informed - they daily prepare food in early morning and freeze it. Microwave it and stick it to poor customer. Complete cheat people"}
{"text":"I remember coming here not too long ago with my family. We ordered the usual stuff that we order when we go to any chaat place.   Its just plain ol' chaat. To be honest, there is nothing here that will make you have dreams at night or bring you back for more. Its just plain chaat. Even for a city like Phoenix, which overall doesn't have amazing chaat, there is better in town."}
{"text":"Tasty, cheap, and quick, Little India serves up various dishes and snacks that will please fans of the spicy complex flavors of Indian cuisine. The main component of Little India is a store with various Indian goods and foods, with a refrigerated section selling freshly made sweets. The actual restaurant is in the back, and to order, get an order card from the cashier in the front and check off what you would like. You can pay for your selections with the cashier in the front after receiving your food.   I browsed through the menu and decided on one of the specials- bhatura, pickled veggies, rice, and mattar paneer. It was a good portion of each component, with the slightly greasy bhatura flatbread, piquant crisp vegetables, white rice, and richly flavored mattar paneer. The only negative about the mattar paneer was that the peas were overcooked, and thus grey and a bit mushy. They don't hold back on the heat, and for those that like more mild food, you've been warned!  Service was pleasant from the front and the back. Prices are very reasonable. The special was $5.99 and I was full after only eating half my meal. I also grabbed a container of gulab jamun ($4.99) from the refrigerated dessert section which contained a lot of the sweet dumplings and was pretty good.   Definitely a good option for tasty yet cheap Indian food!"}
{"text":"This place only runs because the food tastes descent. The owners are both arrogant ! The old man is so arrogant to even open his mouth, he treats his customers as if they are all beggars and he is doing charity by giving food. His wife the cook is another arrogant lady, she thinks that she is doing us a favour by letting us eat there and treated customers with lots of attitude! This place only runs because the food is cheap. I would never go to this place again because of the way they treat their customers and their policies of not accepting card under $10.  I wish I could give this place negative stars."}
{"text":"Have been going to this store for the past 6 yrs while I lived there. The kitchen which prepares food is descent. Their samosas are on the best in the valley. You order what you want by filling out a list with your name and pay at the counter while leaving.  The father/son who sit at the counter are two of their types (thank god). They talk sparingly; not that what they talk is pleasant either. Forget to hear them greet, it looks like they never figured that the jaw ( other than chewing pan) can be stretched a lil to smile as well. I wish they come out with no checkout free shops just to avoid such characters.  It's take-a-quick-bite while doing grocery shopping place.  Both the stars are for the deserving kitchen behind."}
{"text":"Delicious. What do you think of delectable 'chaat' that melts in your mouth? In a way, you're always left unsatisfied after you dig in to these tasty treats, simply because you yearn for more. And yearn I did! I've been frequenting this place for the past two years or so. It is relatively close by to campus, and is definitely on the route to my house, so if it's 100+ degrees and you're experiencing a craving for a flavorful treat, what better place is there other than Little India?   Honestly, I haven't had a myriad of foods here. When I like something, I'm quite obstinate, and I stick to it. However, I have tasted bhel puri at five or so other Indian \"chaat\" places peppered around the valley, and nothing can compare to the bhel puri in Little India! Anyway, instead of yelping about it, I'm going to shut off my laptop, leave campus in an hour or so, and then go to Little India because I'm hungry."}
{"text":"Love this place, we always order soo much stuff that we end up over eating. we just get overwhelmed by the tasty food.  This place has a nice feel to it. the ladies working there are very nice and will make you feel welcomed and at home. I was pregnant and I ordered a Badam halwa (wheat and Almonds sauteed with butter) and the Auntie said this is good for your baby too. It was really nice of her to say that. that Halwa is heavenly, they dont make it all the time, but i guess i have had it once or twice it was amazing.  I'm originally from new Delhi and know the north Indian Street food... we always order Dahi Bhalla (yogurt with flour balls and chutneys), papdi chaat (crispies with yogurt) and some Vegetable curry and rice.  Everything is just amazing, although the grocery variety might not be very good. Their chutneys and Namkeens that are also made by the ladies in the kitchen are for sale in the fridges, we always buy some. those are fresh and very tasty.  Talking about Look, you can never judge an Indian Eat out by its looks, Food speaks for itself, that is why 5 stars.  There might be many fancy places in many other cities in US, but the taste is what matters."}
{"text":"Came here because we heard that the samosas were good and indeed they were. But the attitude of the man behind the counter spoiled the mood! He didn't have the decency to stop chewing paan, when talking to people. Forget about greeting or even smiling he behaved as if we hauling free stuff from him. Just this makes me never want to visit this place again. So the three stars are for for the food alone."}
{"text":"It is definitely not the place that serves you the best indian food but there are not many options in Tempe.   The samosas are ok, and so is the dhokla. The entrees are fine, and are not expensive. Service-wise it is not gona be the best but it is clean and hygenic. You can browse through a lot of Indian spices while you wait for your food.  It is not the place for a romantic dinner, but to grab a bite of quick not-so-spicy Indian food. If you are looking for a sit-down place, try Krishna Cafe in Chandler.  PS-  You might have to cut  the older guy on the counter some slack. I guess he love his tobacco more than the customers."}
{"text":"It's called \"chaat\".  Apparently, this means \"street food\".  Sounds good to me.  The first time I ever heard this term was when I started to look into this restaurant.  I found out about this place from looking here at Yelp and seeing the high ratings.  When we walked in, I was asking myself where the restaurant was.  To find it, you go into the back of this little market and there are a few tables and chairs.  You order by grabbing a card, ticking off the food you want and giving it to the server.  By looking at the pictures on the wall, the meals don't seem that big.  Seeing them in person after they are served doesn't help either.  But, eating is believing--you get a LOT of delicious food for your money here.  May I recommend the Chole Bhature?  It's spiced chick peas in sauce with two BIG pieces of flat bread to eat it with.  This will fill you up fast for $5.25.  No meat here in the dishes.  There's cheese, but all the food here is otherwise veggie.  No matter--you'll enjoy it anyway.  This is another five star review for Little India.  Don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"I was shopping nearby so I thought I'd go check this place out.   As many reviewers have said, this grocery has a chaat kitchen in the back. It isn't a restaurant. I find that people either hate this kind of place or love it. I didn't expect much in terms of the space, but some people do.  I found it to be ran enough, the tables were wiped, but they did have staining. Again, not a big deal to me.   I wish that the menu did a better job explaining the food. I really had no idea what I was ordering.  I ordered the pani puri and the bada paav. I liked the filling for the pani puri and I also liked the patty inside of the bada paav. I could totally have skipped the soggy and tasteless hamburger bun.  Both were flavorful and I enjoyed the spices. I have no idea what \"authentic\" indian food tastes like do I have nothing to compare. I did think it was tasty. I'd like to try the curry!  Communication was a little difficult. I think that may be one of the reasons why other reviewers say that the owner is rude.  He wasn't rude to me, but he wasn't warm either.   I'll definitely Boy Scouts back to try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"There was hair in the food. Not just 1 but 2 in the same Bhel Puri dish.  The whole experience was pretty bad. There is no indication of how you order your food and when you finally figure it out the food does not taste good. We checked sodas on the order sheet and when no sodas showed up we asked if we were supposed to go and find our own sodas from the front of the store and were told that that was the case.  Also the guy at the counter is down right dismissive.  Pani Puri was OK Papdi Chaat - boring, no flavor Bhel Puri - boring and no flavor before we found the hairs  Not worth the trip."}
{"text":"Best (authentic) Indian food in Phoenix. That is, unless your Indian grandmother lived in Phoenix as well."}
{"text":"Best Samaos I eat here.. Very small place but food is good.. Indian home food taste you can get here...  Owner is from Banaras so he knows the north Indian taste..   Cheap and tasty.. I would love to go here again and again.. They do have PAN as well."}
{"text":"Best samosas ever. Though the seating is a little cramped and the customer service might be less restaurant-grade - the food is absolutely worth it.Very healthy, appetizing and delightful for  the palate."}
{"text":"I was super sad when I found out Curry in Hurry was closed, but decided to give Little India a try, and I am extremely happy I did! The food was incredibly delicious and very great price. I even called to let them know how much I loved it! I can't say enough good things about this place!! The Naan bread is to die for! Trust me and give this place a try!! Way to go guys!"}
{"text":"Little Indian store and eatery rolled into one.  Hands down the best place to have chaat (tangy snacks) in the valley - this coming from someone of Indian origin. Whether you want to make a meal out of these or just grab bites, there is great veriety to choose from.  The lunch and dinner combo (chapati/puri, subji, rice, yogurt/pickle) plates are great deals - reasonable portions for 4.99/5.99. The rice is not the best but the sabjis are good. The meal feels complete and satisfying.  And conveient when you can grab a package of sweets or snacks to go!  The men at the counter used to be frumpy, but I think the recession and loss of clientele have taught them to smile occasionally."}
{"text":"I was not happy at all with the quantity and value of the food at the Tropical Delight Noodle House which is beside Little India in Hidden Valley. We choose to not go back there again. This evening we decided we would order just one dish from Little India to check it out and if disappointed nothing major would be lost. So here I am now writing a very positive review. We ordered a medium curry chicken which was simply delicious, the taste and curry affect were perfect, the quantity was more than adequate for two and these was more than ample chunks of chicken. I have never been shy to complain so conversely It's appropriate that I compliment when it's deserving. A sincere 5 star review is well deserved from us."}
{"text":"We ordered a few items for dinner.  Sev Puri: 5/5 Excellent flavor and good mix of spices, chutneys, and dahi  Pani Puri: 1/5 Very weird Pani flavor. There was too much of one ingredient but I don't know which one.   Chole Bhature    Chole: 3/5    Bhature: 4/5  Veg Spring Roll overall: 3/5    Veg Spring Roll itself: 4/5    Veg Spring Roll Sweet Sauce: 2/5  When I return, I'll reorder sev puri and try some other chaat items."}
{"text":"Loved having proper desi tasting meal.  My wife was very satisfied.  We Rice Pulao Bhatura and Matar Paneer and a Khasta Kachori Chaat.  Yum!!!   We will return as will probably everyone. Urgently eating here (they look like regulars).  You order by filling out he pink slip and turn it in and they bring it out.  Fresh, hot and delicious.   Topped it with Halwa... just right!"}
{"text":"I love how all the Indians are negatively rating this place. Yes the owner is a little grumpy, most times it's a generation gap. Think of him as that grumpy uncle each family has.. This food is close to home. Warm, fresh and a lot of flavor. Samosas are the best in South Phx at least. Really fresh and yummy chole Batura."}
{"text":"Really nice chaat. We ordered the aloo tikki chaat, and it was perfect! We also ordered the vegetarian lunch: paneer matar, veg pulao, bhatura and pickle, but it was average--very homely and mildly spiced. The combination, however, seemed to make no sense. Also, the menu mentioned yogurt, but we didn't get any. The rice can be eaten with the paneer, but what about the bhatura? I've never seen people eating bhatura with paneer. I think it was supposed to be eaten with the missing yogurt. Little India also stocks groceries..not an exhaustive list, just the usual dry snacks, masalas, and grains. Yes, the seating arrangements could improve, and it would help if the servers didn't look so mournful. But I guess that would add to the price. I'd choose good food over the frills any day! Oh, and yes, the guy at the counter looks like he was forced to sit there. I have NEVER seen him smile in the dozen or so times that I've been to this store."}
{"text":"Love it here! You can never go wrong. Prices are amazing. It's a little hole in the wall place in a little grocery store in it but you can't beat it! I feel like it's a little hidden secret :) Owner is so nice too. He is there everyday. He Basically lives there! Really good vibes here :)"}
{"text":"They definitely have AWESOME samosas. We ordered samosas, parathas, Pav bhaji, vada pav. The only item I would rate just OK in our order would be their vada pav. Other items we ordered were great. We are planning to go again today before we leave back to CA.  The seating area is really small. I wish they invest some money on expanding their area so people have a better experience and service. Great job to all the ladies who run the kitchen !!! I can definitely relate very well to the service complaints placed by other yelpers."}
{"text":"Just serving delicious chat is not enough, you also need to have decent Customer Satisfaction rate . But the people working here do not understand that.   I had called the front desk to order chola puri Togo for dinner on Thursday night. The owner of this fast food joint told me that it will be ready in 20 minutes. I reached there in 30 mins, but they took 50 mins to get my order ready. I had to stand there for 30 mins with nothing to do and watch people around and waste my time. When I politely raised my concern on the delay to the owner, he told these words - \" YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME TO MY RESTAURANT AGAIN. THIS IS HOW IT IS AND ITS NOT UNDER MY CONTROL\". It was so embarrassing in front of everyone.   This Gentleman is filled with Ego and has no respect to the customers coming to his place. He thinks he is doing us all a favor by running his joint. I STRONGLY DISLIKE THIS PLACE.   They need to change their attitude towards customers otherwise they are gonna lose customers."}
{"text":"Food is not bad. Disgusting toilets. Worst toilets than I have seen in India. The most unfriendly owners you will ever come across. They don't care about customers."}
