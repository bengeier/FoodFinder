{"text":"Stopped by this place because of the good reviews.  I ordered the tri-tip sandwich and the flatbread pepperoni pizza.  Unfortunately, the tri-tip sandwich was bland, tough, and had very little meat.  For the price I was quite disappointed.  The pizza was far better although it needed more cheese.  The staff was friendly and courteous, just wished the food was better."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, mind-blowing Cuban Sandwich.  Every time I lifted the Cuban to take a bite I enjoyed a thick smoky smell just before the flavors hit.  The ciabatta bread was fresh with the perfect amount of bite resistance before the \"give\".  Great first impression - I will be back."}
{"text":"The food was great! Staff was very nice and helpful. Met the owner and he was very friendly and you can tell he loves what he does!  Everything they make is fresh everyday. Especially the bread is yummy and fresh everyday. Love Italian sodas and they had a lot of different options to chose from. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. From the service to the food. By only my second trip in they had my name memorized, greeting me as I walked in. The tri_tip sandwhich and the tri-tip chili are hands down my favorite. If you like root beer or like having a soda with your lunch their broad selection will amaze you. Stop in for a bite you won't be let down."}
{"text":"TL;DR Dozens of Small batch bottled Root Beer for $2.00, UNBELIEVABLE Tri Tip chili (perfect for a chilly day) Sandwiches to keep your tastebuds singing \"praise jeebus!\" BBQ chicken and Pork, delightful, tons of other foodie options, and a steaming hot cup of coffee available in the many varieties we all love at our local Starboxx. Best of all? Prices. Same food quality you would expect at a high end hip cafe, only you won't have to take out a second mortgage or deplete little Timmy's college fund to enjoy. 


I have been visiting this Market since the day they announced it was going to open.

First things first, The staff is fantastic. They learn your name right off the bat and stress excellence in every order they fill. At one point they actually ran food out to my office because I was stuck at my desk for lunch. Name one chain place that would EVER consider doing that? Yeah.. oh it's okay..no it's fine... I'll wait....

Secondly, the owner came over and introduced himself to me by my second visit, he even stopped to have a little conversation, honest nice talking, not just promotional chit chat.

Oh and the Root Beer selection.
Let me tell you something, I am from Detroit, Michigan. I know a thing or two about Root Beer. Heck, we invented the Coney Dog. And this place knows Root Beer.
I have had about 10 of their (dozens?) of options for individual bottled Root Beer and every one is a treat. And as if that isn't cool enough? how about a $2 price tag? WHAT ARE THEY NUTS... I hope none of the staff reads this and realizes that this low price is obscene and they should be locked up in a looney bin before I have the chance to clean them out.
On a serious note, they offer a 10 bottle gift pack (pre packed or 10 of your choice) Soda Pop Bottles Gift box. (Not just Root Beer folks, they have all of the classic sodas) Either take it home for your own enjoyment or gift to a loved one. It saved me this holiday season on a couple of in-laws I was stuck with. 
Oh and the price? $18 bucks. Good lawdy.. lawdy.

Lastly, but certainly not least is the food, that's why you ought to try this place right?

I have had;

The Smokehouse Turkey,
The dill spread and fresh baked sourdough bread make this sandwich my go-to favorite. The peppadew havarti gives this thing the perfect little tang. The only thing that makes this sandwich better is...

The Tri Tip Chili!
Bits of slow roasted Tri Tip in every bite with an amazing chili base. Garnished with a little sprinkle of shredded cheese that melts in upon first glorious bite. Sided with a slice of slightly grilled sourdough. (Order the half and half with the Smokehouse Turkey and This? $7.50. You can thank me later...)

BBQ Chicken Sandwich,
This one takes two hands, tangy bbq sauce makes this one a dream. The slaw is stacked tall and the Monterey jack cheese is a perfect fit with the fall apart pulled smoked chicken.

Mushroom Trio Flatbread Pizza,
Damn. If you are into mushrooms, (the kind that don't make you flashback to that Grateful Dead concert you followed for 3 days in your friend Ricky's '72 baby blue Chevy Vega) Then you will LOVE this Flatbread. 3 kinds of Mushrooms and truffle oil. Yeah.. it's fantastic.

Margherita Flatbread Pizza,
Not sure if the dough could get any better on this one, the subtle classic toppings make for the perfect delivery of the freshly (grilled?) flatbread. Whatever way Chef puts this together, grab a frosty Rootbeer and cheers him upon first bite. Hazah!

Of the many other food options I have not had the pleasure to try yet, I most certainly will get the chance as I am a repeat offender of this place.. and will continue to be so long as they promise to never change what they are doing, dishing out killer food, at a great price, with an awesome staff.

Kudos American Way Market.

{"text":"Tried for the first time recently after going to that antique mall many times and smelling delicious home made bread baking. I must have caught them on a bad day or ordered the wrong thing because my bbq brisket sandwich just was not good. It was too finely chopped and smothered in an overly sweet and thick syrupy sauce. And to make it worse, the cole slaw had cilantro in it. But especially now that I see all these great reviews, I will try it again and get something else next time. Will report back :-)"}
{"text":"Fantastic barbecue place. It is hard to see from the road, but it's attached to the huge antique shop. Family run--we met the whole family, who were all working one Saturday. They were all super-friendly. Best barbecue in the Valley, I think. For dessert, try the chocolate croissants. Everything is baked on the premises, and is super fresh and fantastic."}
{"text":"So, I pretty much stop by here for lunch, once a week. As soon as I walk through the door, I am greeted with a smile and the staff always makes me feel at home. One of these days, I will get something else off of the menu....but.....The TRI-TIP sandwich....is hands down, the best sandwich I have ever tasted. THE BEST. I mean it. Freshly made bread (on all of their items on the menu) and meat that melts in your mouth along with the cheese and perfectly married sauce. (Drooling as I write this..) Friends of mine that have accompanied me here have all tried different things on the menu, and can safely say that this place packs a huge punch. Chef has, from time to time, sneaked a sample of a few items for me to try and I have not been surprised how great things taste here. From the great selection of hard to find sodas, unbelievable chefs to the always pleasant cashiers- family owned business by the way, (most of the time, can just about reach the cash register, and are cute as a button..) this great spot will never disappoint!! 
Can't wait 'til lunchtime."}
{"text":"The BEST pulled pork sandwiches and snickerdoodle cookies I've ever had! Great service, home town atmosphere and delicious food!!"}
{"text":"This is far and away my favorite place for lunch.  Try the pastrami or the cuban.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here several times and have never had a bad meal. The food is always fresh, looks great, tastes great, and comes out hot/cold depending on the dish. I highly recommend the Smokehouse Turkey sandwich, iced tea and the Slaw-slightly spicy with cilantro- delicious! I love that everything on their menu is their own- and you can't find it elsewhere. We've gone here always for lunch as it is close to our office- we always make it back to the office on time full and happy."}
{"text":"When I see rave reviews I tend to be cautiously optimistic, but in this case it is earned. Not only is the food great, but the price is beyond reasonable for the quality of food you are getting. This was my first time there and I had a half pulled pork sandwich and a cup of cheddar ale soup. The whole meal was great and I now have a list of things I want to try.

Also, getting and eating my food did not take a ridiculous amount of time. Was able to keep the whole trip under 30 minutes and wasn't rushed to eat. Another plus is they have a water cooler and cups, and they had larger cups so you don't have to keep getting up if you are a water drinker.

Staff was great! Friendly and helpful.

Bought a loaf of the fresh sourdough to take home. Can't wait to try it."}
{"text":"Had lunch there for the first time on 7-27-17.  I ordered the American Harvest salad and it was excellent!  The staff was friendly from the minute you walk into their area (the restaurant is located inside the antique store) and service was very quick.  Seating was great with different table sizes to accommodate the number of guests.  Thank you for the excellent service and great food."}
{"text":"The menu is limited but good. The American Harvest salad is a very tasty salad.  It's chock-full of greens, butternut squash, beats, pecans, pepitas and chicken... Such a great combination of flavor and texture.  My friend likes the Curry Chicken salad sandwich which I think also looks delicious.. The food  is fresh, the portions are generous, the prices are fair and I do love the vintage atmosphere! ... BUT...  the service tends to be very slow both at intake and delivery to table. They don't generally greet you with a smile and often seem confused at the register (iPad). I also dislike being served in \"to-go\" containers when you are sitting down in the restaurant. It would be so much nicer and less wasteful, to use real dishes which you can see they have in plain sight in the kitchen.  I was hoping they would work out some of the \"bugs\" after a few months, but they still seem to struggle in those areas."}
{"text":"You know those restaurants that leave you thinking about and craving what you ate the next day? THIS is one of those restaurants. Their food is to die for. Not to mention, the antique mall it's located in. The ambiance of the store and the restaurant makes me feel like I'm out of town, on a fun getaway, in a quaint little town. The Cuban club is AMAZING. I've been here many times, always trying a different pastry, sandwich, or soda pop and have always left amazed at the food quality. The staff is friendly and helpful. American way market is a wonderful addition to chandler, Arizona."}
{"text":"I have to say, if you want excellent smokehouse food, at decent price, this is the place.  If you want to see how a smokehouse's food is, you have to start with the brisket.  
Why the brisket?  Because if they can smoke a brisket right, everything else on the menu is bound to be good.
Moist, tender, just melt in your mouth heaven for your taste buds.  Seasoned well, with the right amount of smokiness.  You can get BBQ sauce and coleslaw on it as well.
So when you go in and have the food, be sure to give the pit master a well deserved hand shake, tip your hat to this joint, because you will want to come back."}
{"text":"This place is a freaking gem. The Smoked Brisket Sandwich just satisfied all the cravings I didn't know I had."}
{"text":"The best pulled pork sandwich! The food is delicious, the service is excellent, and the staff is so friendly. This is definitely a place that I will come back to over and over again.."}
{"text":"This is a very large antique mall. They have a good variety of items. The ladies at the front desk aren't too friendly. The lady and her daughter at the food area are very nice and the cookies taste amazing."}
{"text":"First trip to the antique market in general and of course first time to the diner as well.  GREAT little place! Clean, antique, rustic kind of style with all kinds of bottled sodas, amazing looking baked goods and a great variety on the menu. I am eating more salads at the moment.. ahem... so I went for the BLT. It was perfect! Loved it! I will definitely be back for some barbecue even if I skip the shopping."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday.  The smoked pastrami on marble rye was fantastic! Looking forward to my next trip to American Way!"}
{"text":"Tried this out on a whim on a Saturday afternoon. Place was busy but we were still able to find a place to sit. Seems like it's family owned. Kids were helping deliver food to patrons. That was awesome to see. Lunch was good. 1/2 and 1/2 combo. Free refills with iced tea. Cookies were awesome and homemade. I would say plan to spend time here. It's connected to the marketplace antique shop and we could have spent forever here. So much cool stuff to look at. I would say the only downside is the kids grilled cheese was like an artisanal cheese sandwich and so my picky 6 year old wasn't used to it. We would have loved to try the flatbread pizza for her but they were all out. I would definitely come back again. Cool place to eat and shop."}
{"text":"If you haven't tired American Way Market you're missing out on some amazing food. I had one of their toffee cookies and I wasn't sure what to expect. Well, my expectations weren't disappointed. I loved it's sweet gooey goodness. It was simple and straightforward. If you like toffee you're in for a treat.

What really pulled me in, and I fell in love with, was the Cheddar Ale soup. Such a rich smooth flavor. And so creamy. I also had the American Harvest salad, which was hearty and so filling. I loved the sweetness of the champagne vinaigrette dressing that comes with it, it complements the heartiness of the salad beautifully. The soup, combined with the American Harvest salad, are a knockout combination. One you're taste buds will appreciate.

If you want some straightforward good eats give American Way Market a shot. It's one worth taking. I promise you that you won't be disappointed. Something like American Way Market is worth at least trying once, and maybe a dozen times more afterwards."}
{"text":"This is a cool place. The food was great and don't forget the desserts. Cookies are the bomb. After eating, browse the shops. Who knows you'll probably find a gem."}
{"text":"I had the brisket sandwich, it was hands down the best I have ever half. Other person ordered the turkey sandwich and it was amazing as well. To top it off with their brownie, it was as good as the other foods. Definitely didn't disappoint!!!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by its location.
Inside the Antigue Mall is a real hidden treasure.
Fresh baked bread.
Fresh bbq made on site.
Old Time feel, and the food.
I have not had anything here that was not delicious."}
{"text":"Great addition to an already great shopping destination! This place is inside an antique mall which has a great unique and craft atmosphere. The food is all made from scratch with local and fresh ingredients but the star of the show is truly the bread which is made on site by Proof an artisan bread maker. I tried the cheddar soup and it was to die for! The bread and a slaw in the pork sandwich we're also exceptional and the flavors of the meat were really good. The only suggestion I would have is for dishes to eat on site as opposed to disposables for everything."}
{"text":"Edgar for the win! Smoked egg salad sandwich with side of potato salad was a carbo-licious delight. Definitely going back so the hubs can try some smoked meat, and will make time to browse the antiques in the store!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  Ordered a smoked kielbasa sandwich and enjoyed it immensely.  The flavor of the smoked meat was exceptional, and it was served perfectly on a brioche bun.  Also got a toffee cookie- to die for. The sandwiches and bakery items are second to none."}
{"text":"Slow service. Food average. Def not 5 stars. Had the tri tip--barely average. Egg salad--below average."}
{"text":"Everything here is alright. The Brisket is overpriced for what you are getting (take Rudy's for example, which has even more affordable Brisket and it is miles ahead of this). They messed up my friend's order by giving them the wrong sandwich and didn't even give him his cookie. My other friend did not enjoy his food either. The place had a nice setting, and it is a cool local, but overall pretty average. Not a huge fan of this place."}
{"text":"I went antiquing with a few friends and we decided grab a bite to eat since this restaurant is actually inside the antique mall.  We were pleasantly surprised at how good the food was!  We each ordered something different- brisket, pastrami, tuna salad, grilled cheese and asian salad.  Everything was delicious!  The choc chip cookies were really good - and huge!  We shared.  Their extensive selection of bottled pop is fun, too.  SO MANY choices!"}
{"text":"Super cute cafe tucked in an antique market! Was in the neighborhood and wanted to try a new spot! Girls behind the counter are super friendly and everything looks fresh! Got the BBQ chicken , large size and loved the BBQ SAUCE! Check in for the free cookie- so moist and soft and large enough to split with someone! Got the beer cheese soup- meh wouldn't get that again personally- but tons of other options on the menu! Loved the large selection of classic soda in the glass bottles!"}
{"text":"Delicious doesn't even describe this place! I didn't even know this place existed but i am so glad that we stumbled across it. It is a cute little market tucked inside the antique mall. They have an array of beverages and sweet confections as well as a pretty decent sized menu.  We ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the smoked pastrami sandwich along with a giant brownie. The pastrami was served on marble rye and provolone cheese with pickled red onion and apple aioli and it was absolutely delicious. I can't wait to go back and try something else. The staff is super friendly and it's a great little place to have a bite after shopping.  If you are in the area i would definitely recommend stopping in. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this cute little vintage cafe by mistake on a Saturday afternoon. We were in the mood for barbecue brisket, this place popped up and this restaurant was on our way home. When we got there Alexandria the waitress who was very helpful, apologetically told us that they were all out of beef brisket. She said the pulled barbecue pork sandwich was also very good, so we decided to give that a try. She was right it was delicious! The pork was so tender and juicy and it was a very large serving around 4- 6 ounces. The price was under $10 for the sandwich, a great deal for the amount of meat piled high on the soft bun. Since I checked in with Yelp, I also got a free cookie. There were two flavors to choose from: toffee and chocolate chip. Alexandria said that they are known for their toffee cookies so I decided to go with her recommendation. It was soft with lots of toffee chunks throughout. Overall, the food was great and so was the service. I'll definitely go back to see what the brisket is all about!"}
{"text":"Whoa..where has this place been all my life. A huge array of BBQ meats stared at me from the menu board - all very tempting. On this day though, hanging near the register was a sign advertising the special Smoked Pastrami sandwich. It had provolone cheese, some kind of apple aioli and slaw. This wasn't the greatest smoked pastrami ever, but this is a rare find in BBQ joints and in the realm of things, this would be in the top three. Obviously a weird store attached to an antique shop and also featuring dozens of vintage soda's. Will have to return and try another meat. Also, get your free cookie with Check-in because somehow these chips of chocolate stayed moist in these cookies and it was like the cookies were warm all day. Great cookies."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My wife and I went to look and get ideas for our home. This place is full of ideas and just really cool stuff. Then we happened to find the amazing little cafe attached. The pulled pork is amazing. The Tri-tip is amazing. Come hungry and leave full. Make sure that you get there early enough to get yourself some chocolate chip cookies and a brownie. You will thank me."}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ and amazing cookies! We loved the smoked pulled pork sandwiches and the beans were great too...very flavorful with the perfect amount of kick. Their toffee choc chip and molasses cookies were the perfect ending to a yummy lunch. The only downside was that it took a looooong time to order and get our food. Don't go if you're in a hurry. But if you've got an open afternoon I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite local cafe. The food is unique and flavorful. Such a great atmosphere and you get to explore the treasures in the antique shop afterward."}
{"text":"The Good and Bad

Friday evening antiquing is what led us to American Way Market.  Their partnership with proof bread as well as their smoked barbecue selections looked very promising. 

There tritip sandwich blew away my expectations. The tritip was cut Deli thin and stacked high. The sandwich from proof bread was the cherry on top.

I was disappointed with the smoked brisket. They require you to buy their meat in half pound increments, and I believe that the rub or wood they use was too sweet for my liking.

The salad that they offered seemed to be premade; The tall tale sign seem to be the dried and rubbery beets that they add it to the salad.

I would come back alone for the tritip sandwich but would be way too afraid to explore any other dishes."}
{"text":"Love the food at this awesome place. There can be a bit of a wait at high peak times but the food is fantastic and so fresh! The staff is friendly.  The tea is tasty! (Always a plus for me) my favorite is the Cuban club the turkey with some awesome sauce and I tried jackfruit that tasted like pulled pork. I loved it! So my vegetarian friends would love that taste as well. Portions are generous:) staff is sweet and kind:)"}
{"text":"The beef brisket and BBQ chicken sandwiches are Absolutely delicious! Next time I'm asking for the coleslaw to go on my sandwich. Very filling"}
{"text":"This place is really great. They have a good menu, all their meats are smoked so they are all delish. They even smoke the eggs for a yummy take on egg salad sandwich. They also have really good salads. The BLT salad is my favorite, but just had the chicken Caesar salad really yummy with the smoked chicken and home made croutons. They also have a nice selection of hot and cold coffee drinks and a desserts. It's also great to walk around after you eat and look at the great treasures in the antique mall. It's not dingy or dirty antiques, it's more of a home decor mall, but nothing from Wal-Mart/China."}
{"text":"Not enough reviews. I love this place. Every rootbeer or bottled soda you could ask for in Arizona. 

Delicious sandwiches and bakery. I have tried the pulled pork and warm pastrami sandwiches. Awesome!  Cookies are best in East Valley. Shop and storefront do not stand out from main road but they are huge inside."}
{"text":"Really good food, great atmosphere and a soda selection that includes things that I haven't seen in over 40 years. I've had the pulled pork sandwich and the chili - both were very good."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!  The staff, food and atmosphere are all amazing.  Jared A, Jared H and Kim are very friendly and helpful!  I recommend the Pulled Pork or the Cuban sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is doing everything right. Awesome fresh baked bread and pastries. Fresh salads, and pizza. Great attention to detail, this will be a regular visit for me."}
{"text":"Walked around the shop/s for a few minutes and decided that it was time for a feeding. At first glance the Market appears like an urban country cafe. Early morning baked goods, bbq, tri-tip...dark chocolate coconut monster cookies and nearly every throw back soda you can ever want. 

Friendly staff, no wait and amazing food!! I had:

1. Tri tip sandwich with greens and gouda
2. Brisket with slaw

Both were sandwiches and both amazing for an unassuming jewel in the wall market. 

My guest had the vegetarian jackfruit bbq sandwich- which was also delicious!

And the cookie!  Truly a must! Cant leave this place without a treat."}
{"text":"I loved this little cafe inside a shopping venue. Ingenious! The Cuban was delicious and quite generous sized serving. I could only eat 1/2. 

The pepperoni pizza has a very smokey flavor that my guest didn't care for so beware of that if you don't like smokey flavors. 

Lastly I might recommend not informing your guest that you only have enough tuna left for 1/2 a sandwich. Doesn't sound very fresh or appealing when you put it that way. Perhaps just say your out! 

The baked goods looked amazing and I would go back just for that!"}
{"text":"We just had a quick lunch and split the tuna melt which was more than enough for two.
It was the best tuna melt I had in a long long time and I would recommend it highly.
The owner, cook and counter person actually seemed happy to be there and the food reflects that.
I took home a fresh baked cinnamon role and crousant that looked great as there is a bakery on site.
if you are in the area stop in. You will have a great experience."}
{"text":"Wow!! I just had the Smoked Tri-Tip sandwich for the 10th time In the past 3 months.  Every time it keeps getting better.  You have to come and try American Way Market, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place for antiques and they have a good. Lunch too! A huge variety or Rootbeers and other pop in bottles. If you want to go someplace relaxed and different this is the place!"}
{"text":"Amazing food , friendly staff and great atmosphere to make memories in.  Hands down one of my favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"First time here. Pretty good. I had the Cuban sandwich and I enjoyed it although if you aren't a fan of really crusty bread I would get it on a different bread. My mom liked the tuna salad and my husband ordered the chili which he said was spicy but not amazing. They have a large selection of bottled sodas but the one we chose was not very cold which was disappointing."}
{"text":"Delicious.. had the Cuban club and it was the most flavorful yummy club I've had.. the staff was way friendly .. place has a great vibe and the prices are very reasonable.. don't pass this gem up!"}
{"text":"Driving by, the old Hudson on the roof caught our attention. The website talks about a fresh bread from the bakery but we must have been to late in the day because all we saw were sweets. The cafe was small and crowded and looked more like a cafe adjacent to the antique market. Probably a great place for pickers combing through every aisle of the antique stalls next door, but not a destination cafe."}
{"text":"The smoked meat sandwiches are amazing!  Tri-tip, brisket, Cuban club...you can't go wrong. Everything is scratch made and delicious including the potato salad and slaw for sides and the bread too!  Truly a hidden gem with an antique store that's one of the best in the area attached to it. The staff was awesome too...Edgar was a huge help for first time customers!"}
{"text":"Oh the bread.  I'm crazy about Proof Bread.  I've served their bread multiple times to multiple people and everyone raves about it.  The only problem is once you've developed a taste for Proof bread it's very difficult to enjoy any other bread."}
{"text":"Very nice location with excellent food. Very accommodating with minor menu requested changes. BBQ and salads very well presented and fresh. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is our second time back and it's still AMAZING!!! Unbelievable soft sourdough bread that's still warm from the oven... Smoked turkey was incredible.  I want to buy the meat and bread and dill spread in bulk and take it home!  Yum yum yummmmmmm"}
{"text":"Would have loved to try, on yelp the hours are until 4pm and inside the store they have a sign that says open until 3pm. Suffice to say I came at 3:05 and it was closed :/"}
{"text":"A co-worker and I have gone to American Way a couple of times now for lunch.  The staff is exceptionally friendly and the food is great.  Unique twists on old favorites.  I look forward to trying something new every time we go!  The BEST chocolate chip cookie I have ever tasted!"}
{"text":"Yep, this place wins. Not just because of their food, but their excellent service. I got the BBQ chicken sandwich. It just made me want to try other things there. Delicious and filing. I used the Yelp checkin to get a free cookie but they said they were cooking more and that I could get a pop tart instead. I agreed as I was intrigued. It was my lunch hour so I got my food to go. I didn't expect to eat the pop tart there, but I gave in. It was delicious and gone quickly. It did take a bit longer than expected to get my sandwich but I think they noticed that, as the cook made sure he knew my order and got it out quickly once realized. The girl cashier gave me a free cookie for my wait. Which was totally unnecessary but a good way of making yourself stand out. Very impressed with their customer service and I am excited to take my girlfriend here to show her the cute shop."}
{"text":"Super yummy food and the desserts are such a great deal. $4.50 for a brownies the size of my kids face and $3 for a huge cookie! I just wish they did a few breakfast items and opened up for food when the antique store opens. Came today wanting some breakfast before shopping but sad to see it's not offered. Anyways, still great lunch food and again the dessert options are BOMB."}
{"text":"Went there last Friday for lunch.  Had the Cuban Sandwich.  Wish there was more than 5 star to rate the place.  All home made bread and smoked meat made a terrific sandwich.  I will go back and eat my way through their menu.  Service was quick and the food was delicious.  A must try for those that love fresh home made sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place is quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants in the entire East Valley. You simply cannot find this level of service, quality food and atmosphere anywhere else in the state. I come here to shop, to eat, and to people watch. You must try the market dip sandwich, I get mine with the brisket and it is the best sandwich I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Best damn pork sandwich of my life. The fiancé and I came at a hectic time, but the food was worth it. Owner was real nice and when I complimented the food, he brought out some of his new creation for me to try, an Alabama white sauce chicken. Best damn chicken I ever had. They have every kind of root beer known to man, which was fun and cool. We even picked up some birch beers to go ( root beer). The set up is a little small for the demand, but hey, good food is worth the wait. 

I will add that on a Saturday there were an F ton of annoying people who weren't giving their kids any attention, so there was a ton of screaming. So obnoxious.. Just beware of that small downside on the weekends. 

Will be back."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to American Way for lunch last Friday.  I've passed the antique mall several times and had no idea there was a restaurant inside.

If you haven't been here, you have to go.  Their pulled pork sandwich may have been the best I have ever had. I can't stop talking about this place and look forward to taking my family very soon!"}
{"text":"Where do I even begin? This is going to be my new favorite spot, how about there? We had the cheddar ale soup. We had the tri-tip chili. Had several of the sandwiches. (We got several and shared). The Cuban was great. The Pizza looked great. They have a barista that is amazing. They have a salted caramel brownie that I named crack. Wow. I can't wait to go back and try more. One thing that I love is they have a ton of different bottled sodas to choose from too. The candied bacon cream soda was my favorite. For
Reals. It's good. If you are looking for some great BBQ. Some great sandwiches. Soups, chilies. Desserts. Whatever.  They have it. It's a place I will keep visiting. I'm posting several pics too so you can see but this place is better than 5 starts. If you live anywhere near Chandler GO NOW!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! Delicious eats, yummy cookies, and right next to an antique store....great place to spend the afternoon with my daughter! Will be back again!!"}
{"text":"They smoke the meats onsite. Fresh & delicious. Only open for lunch (until 3pm) pastries until 4pm, I believe. I've had their Cuban Club twice now! It's has that just right blend of smokey & spicy! 
It's located inside of Merchant Square Antique Shop."}
{"text":"I have been back here a few times for coffee and to work out of here. Yesterday I had lunch again. Honestly, I raved about it my first time, but the second time may have been better. The Cheddar ale soup is still amazing. We can add on the tri tips sandwhich as something that is worth making the trip for. Also I am not a desert person, I eat it maybe 1 time a year. Tried the blondie brownie... O...M...G... I mean that. WOW. Yea... it's that good. Also I should add the staff there is amazing. They are all so nice, help you make decisions, give advice, make sure everything is ok.. just over the top great service."}
{"text":"We were shopping at the antique store and stopped by for a snack for our daughter.  

The service was not good.  There were 3 families in line and the person taking orders pulled the 3rd family to the front of the line and ignored the people that were already in line."}
{"text":"This is defiantly my favorite place for lunch, trying to be come a regular. Service is great and the dude behind the counter is always on top of his shit knows the menu and won't let me forget the daily special. Tri-tip sandwich is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I don't know how many times I have driven past this place and haven't noticed. They have an occasional flea market outside in the parking lot of the building. I have been there and still did not notice there was a restaurant. My wife and I enjoy trying new places (for us) and supporting local businesses when we can. She was the one who suggested that we go here. Even pulling into the parking lot I asked her where we were going. I didn't realize that an excellent barbeque restaurant was mere feet away. They have more than just barbeque - my mother in law was with us and had a Cuban sandwich she really enjoyed. My wife had the pulled pork sandwich, and I the tri-tip plate with a side of beans. Everything was excellent, and I was surprised that even though I was unfamiliar with the restaurant I was definitely in the minority because the place was packed. They also have a great selection of vintage sodas if you are looking for a little nostalgia. Now that I know this place is here and the food is excellent, I will return."}
{"text":"This was our second stop at American Way Market.  Last time we stopped they were out of brisket.  We still wanted to try their brisket especially after having their delicious pulled pork sandwich about 6 months previously.

It was lunch time and we expected it to be busy.  It was.  There was a line and the line moved pretty slow.  The reason for the slow line wasn't because of the cashiers.  It was because all the people ahead of me were ordering items from the bakery display.  Oh my!  All those huge cookies, brownies and other items looked good.  Having willpower to pass them up would have been difficult, I'm sure.  It was for me.

So, the brisket sandwich was delivered along with a grilled cheese sandwich for my companion.  It's not that he doesn't like brisket, he does.  He just wasn't hungry and figured he'd give my brisket a try.

The brisket was very good.  There's no getting around that.  It had a great smokey flavor and the sandwich was piled high with it.  I would have preferred that the meat was smothered in BBQ sauce though.  I love the taste of the meat without the sauce.  I also loved the meat without the sandwich bread even though it was fresh.  I would have loved to have ordered some of their sliced brisket but they don't offer it.  The coleslaw was amazing.  I'm not sure what the flavor was (apple?) but delicious.  It was probably the best I'd ever had.

Now the grilled cheese sandwich .... not good.  You couldn't taste the cheese.  Was there cheese between those two slices of bread?  Yes because you could see it but not taste it.

I'm still giving a 4-star rating but that's for everything else about this place.  it's good and worth a stop."}
{"text":"Booooooo... how is the kitchen closed a hour before they close? Ill try 5 hours early next time to be safe."}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch after being visited by one of their marketing reps distributing menus, coupons and samples. The experience exceed my expectations. The cafe is situated inside a large antique warehouse. They have an assortment of sodas, desserts, preservatives and pickled vegetables to browse while you wait for your meal. I did wait about 10 minutes for my food but I assume that was because it was being freshly prepared. It certainly tasted that way. I very much enjoyed my tuns salad sandwich on sourdough bread and the potato salad was some of the best I've ever had. I love that they are only 5 minutes away from work. I will definitely be back in!"}
{"text":"Love love this place! We go here for lunch a couple of times per week and always have fresh food delivered with a smile. Sometimes it gets really busy, but is worth the wait. The salads are all delicious. You can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches. And the toffee cookie is amazing! I give it 5 stars and would give them 10 if I could."}
{"text":"We finally came in here having driven past a dozen times. I'm so glad I did! 
Right now we're sitting in the café eating the biggest cookie and brownie I've ever seen. Do good. The guy behind the counter is very friendly. I can't wait to go shop antiques. 
This is great!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this establishment and was impressed with the prices.  I ordered a turkey sandwich on sourdough. It was good. The unsweetened tea was good as well. I did try their sea salted caramel brownie but it was too rich for my liking. I'd like to try to come back to try their pulled pork sandwich, tri-tip chili, and homemade pop tart.  The customer service was excellent."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I stumbled upon it while looking for lunch spots in my new work area and I'm glad I did. I'm a huge supporter of local businesses and this place deserves the recognition. The people here are happy and friendly, and my tuna melt was killer. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best smokehouse I've been too in a long time. The Cuban is a great manwich and there's so many vintage bottled sodas you don't know what to get! Guess I'll have to come back. I had really awesome customer service from the Kim!"}
{"text":"Super tasty and super adorable I love the thrift shops connected to the diner. Eat shop browse and enjoy the area. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town and bakery cookies are to die for new flavors daily. Nice friendly staff and a chill coffee shop vibe u get when eating there"}
{"text":"Good food. A little bit of a wait but not bad. It is a little pricey but worth it. Was told to come here by fellow co-workers and so glad I did. Too many fast food place near my work and this was a very pleasant change."}
{"text":"Wow.  What a wonderful little find.  Thanks Yelp!

My son had the tri-tip sandwich.  He took one bite, looked up and said\" this might be the best sandwich I've ever had, dad.\"  It was delicious, with chimichurri sauce and home made artisan sourdough.  I had the harvest salad, which again, was out of this world terrific.

The owner came to check on our meal, and we told him how much we liked it.  He also asked, \"how did you learn about us?\"  Yelp!

Speaking of Yelp, I asked the owner about the review someone had left on Yelp about the \"barely average \" tri-tip sandwich and the \"below average\" egg salad.  We laughed.  There's always one, right?  The owner says, \"well, you can say a lot about our egg salad, but you can't call it average.  You can say you don't like the smokey flavor (the eggs are smoked in a smoker for 2-3 hours after they're boiled), but you just can't call it average.\"  He then went and filled a little cup with a sample of the egg salad and invited my son and I to decide for ourselves.  Holy smokes (pun intended)!  I'm not typically an egg salad kind of guy, but I'll absolutely be ordering this on one of my next visits.  Out of this world.

I have to add how amazing the sourdough is. Their Proof bread is crazy good.  I've been to many places throughout the world, and I don't know that I've ever had such delicious sourdough...certainly never this good in the home of sourdough, San Francisco.  And this is in our backyard...Chandler.  I brought a loaf home.  It looks like I'm going to have to start working out, because I'll be back very soon.

We have a wedding coming up, and I think there's a very good possibility that we'll check on catering prices for some of their delicious dishes.  The great thing is that I get to go back soon, to introduce my wife to their food!

A very quick and easy way to summarize the food here would be QUALITY.  What a local gem."}
{"text":"Wow did my mouth just experience that heaven... Smoked Tri Tip steak sandwich, with a chimichurri sauce that was sent from heaven. Had a Butterscotch Beer Soda(non alcoholic) that was liquid candy! Haven't had something taste that good in a while!!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since it opened and did not disappointment.   Rustic homemade bread for their sandwiches, gourmet salads, and more.   Look forward coming back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Great family owned food and service. Definitely personal care as they ask and listen on how they did. Had the cheddar ale soup, pulled pork sandwich and tuna sandwich. The coleslaw had cilantro and tasted great."}
{"text":"PROS:
Cute area and set up, counter service is casual and cute kiddos (family owned) bring you your food
Pulled pork sandwich - very flavorful and great brioche bun
Market dip - BF got this sammy, enjoyed it like an au jus
The baked beans - salt and spicy bacon in the beans as well! 
Best desserts - salted caramel blondie and peanut butter cookie

CONS:
Sad side pickle
That's it!"}
{"text":"First time here, came with hubby for lunch while running errands. Liked the open feel of the café,  compared to when it was Pittsburgh Willy's. Ordering was easy at the counter. Hubby had the pastrami special, I ordered the Cuban Club -- both were excellent. The one downfall was the wait for our food; we arrived around 1:30 & experienced no line. It wasn't particularly busy, either, with 4 tables occupied & all but 1 eating. However, it took a good 20-25 min wait for our meals, during which we refilled hubby's soda. We were about to ask about the delay when the food arrived. Good thing we had no place to go & all day to get there, right? Prices were reasonable, too. If we come back, I'd like to try the Curry Chicken Salad sandwich, just because it sounds good!"}
{"text":"This one is for you all. Thank you for always taking care of my co workers and I when we raid your space and stay for too long. We love going to American way. It is definitely a department tradition. We always do the free check-in cookie offer as well. As a woman who only eats fish, the tuna salad sandwhich is pretty delicious! The spanish salad is great to pair with a 1/2 sandwhich. I love antique shopping next door after a great meal as well!

Favorites: 
Deserts- ALL THE BROWNIES... especially the blond!
Drinks-Order a sparkling water with any syrup and make your own soda... I love the peach flavor!
Salad-  Spinach Salad
Sandwich- Jackfruit burger

Go meet the family at American Way... you will love it! I am pretty sure my department holds 7 of the top 10 spots for check-ins here... WE LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"I have frequented this Cafe several times now and they haven't failed me yet. The Bakery items a hands down the best I ever had!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise - just came to shop and found this great spot. The Artisan bread was tasty with theCuban sandwich. The pork was tender and seasoned nicely. The spinach salad was great with chicken, cranberries, apricots and the creamiest goat cheese. Excellent place to stop even if you don't shop. Although we did and it was a fun place to meander and explore. We are coming back!"}
{"text":"Three and a half almost four stars. Excellent service!  It is in the antique store, and the have done a great job with the decor and atmosphere!  

They use high quality ingredients. I had the cheddar ale soup and the Asian chicken salad. The soup was too rich for me, but it was good in its own way. I liked the salad, but the smoked chicken was too smokey for my taste. 

I also had a strawberry poptart. It looked pretty but I would not get it again. Not enough filling to crust ratio. 

I want to go back and try some different things. I appreciate what they are doing. I just didn't care as much for what I ordered."}
{"text":"Fresh baked bread, any soda you can think of, and some local history to boot. And oh yeah, the food is amazing! We ate here for lunch while antiquing in Merchant Square. The food is fresh and the staff was great. They said they will be expanding the menu soon so I will definitely be back to try the new stuff."}
{"text":"This is such a charming cafe! The Ryan is quite the salesman and intrigued us with dessert first(more on the later). 
The girls and I are out shopping for antiques and decided to stop in and try it out. We weren't disappointed! I had the pastrami sandwich on crusty sourdough with a tangy aioli sauce. The girls got salads that were filled with a variety of greens and tender chicken. 
We couldn't pass on dessert and had a hard time deciding between the monster brownie, colossal cookies or gooey rice crispy treat. You can have your dessert warmed and add a scoop of ice cream for a $1 more. We ended up with the snickerdoodle and savored the buttery, cinnamon bites! 
Stop here for lunch even if you don't like antique shopping."}
{"text":"First time today at American Way.
Food was ammmmmazing!
I got the 1/2 pulled pork sandwich, 1/2 american harvest salad option. Both were fresh and delicious. 
The breads for the sandwich are also freshly made there and the pork was juicy and yummy.
The place is part of the antiques market and you can also browse around all the interesting stuff they got afterwards.
We're gonna be going back there again!"}
{"text":"These people are doing it right! From the food to service to ambiance everything was spot on. For lunch we had the tri tip sandwich, the pulled pork sandwich and homemade soup. Everything was delicious but the tri tip on homemade bread with house made chimi churry was something to right home about. We will be going back for it! Friendliest staff i have encountered in a while. You can tell there is a real passion backing them. Thank you guys!!"}
{"text":"They make fresh sourdough bread everyday I bought one to take home and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I have never been here. What a cute little brunch/lunch spot. I have driven by it multiple times thinking it was just a business complex. So glad I decided to stop in today. They have great bakery goodies and pastries, a wide selection of bottled sodas, smokehouse sandwiches, salads, and coffee. Ordered the brisket sandwich. It came with slaw. Was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing food with a quaint old-fashioned farm feel. Great customer service!! Can't wait to come back."}
