{"text":"Best Steak Hoagie in Pittsburgh!!!!  They have an awesome staff.  You must get their Steak Hoagie if you are even remotely close to this place.  Their Mac n Cheese is fantastic as well, but they are always out of it!!!"}
{"text":"After standing there for 5 minutes and two people behind the counter can't even say,\" Hello,  I'll be with you in a minute\" I'm not willing to try you again. It bothers me that you move down to the location that you're at and then you change the entire  flavor of what made the place what it is today.  Maybe you'll read this and understand that the guys standing at the register does have something to do with the customers coming in!!!!!"}
{"text":"I always get an original. It's always GREAT. Love this place.  Oh, and the staff are great too...."}
{"text":"Overall this place is pretty good! I usually walk down here to get a sandwich on my lunch break. The meatball sandwich is pretty good! Also the employees are super friendly, very laid back environment, and they talk to you like they've known you forever. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"ONLY TWO REVIEWS??!!!??!  Seriously, Yelpiverse.  I know Real McCoy had a previous listing before closing, moving and reopening, but even the old listing had only 12 reviews.  It's possible people are overwhelmed with the number of options in the South Side, I get that.  But if you're looking for a great cheap sandwich place, eventually you have to come to Real McCoy.    I spent my time living in the South Side and patronized the old location on numerous occasions.  The new location is definitely a step up (no pun intended as the old location had steps at the street entrance).  They're still serving up some of the best sandwiches at some of the best prices around.  You'll still get great service.  The new location is bigger and offers seating as well.    On my last visit, I went with the classic Real McCoy sandwich to go.  Sure, I had just left another sandwich shop but while driving down East Carson Street, I just couldn't pass up Real McCoy.  And that sandwich with those peppers seeping their juices into the bread, on top of that meat and cheese....it tasted better than I remembered.  And the fact that I could add a Schneider's orange drink for just a few cents more?  Pittsburgh perfection."}
{"text":"McCoy reminds me of band subs from when I was in the suburbs.  If they are what you are in to, you'll love Real McCoy.  If you love Jimmy John's, you'll love Real McCoy as a local alternative.  I had the Italian type hoagie and a ground beef hoagie.  The ground beef hoagie was greasy.  The Italian type was oily.  If you are looking for a simple 'greasy spoon' type hoagie, this is 100% the place for you.  I'd prefer Carson Street Deli.  They seem to have higher quality ingredients."}
{"text":"As I sat there chomping away at my freshly made sandwich I started to contemplate how to write my review for this place.  While alternating between my sandwich in hand and the side of mac n cheese that I ordered I kept thinking to myself how this place, even though it states that it has been around for 50 years or so, had so little reviews.  I kept gnawing away at the sandwich and thought to myself what adjectives could I use to convey how fresh and well flavored this way.  All while I'm doing this I watch as the workers interacted so well with customers as they walked in.  Especially giving extra attention to what appears to be the regulars.  The workers were so upbeat, pleasant and really invested in the well being of every customer that came through the door.  With every customer exiting they made sure to chime in with an \"Enjoy your day\" as they walked out onto the sidewalk.  Nearing the midpoint of my sandwich, I noticed that the interior was inviting and that there was enough seating to make sure that you could enjoy your quick lunch, such as what I was doing.  Simple colors make for a decent atmosphere.  I scan the few items hanging on the walls and keep thinking to myself this is so good.  Then, as I near the end of my sandwich, all gears in my head stop.  Why?  I had taken a bit and clamped down on something that was not meat, lettuce, cheese or bread.  I try not to panic and calmly reach up to my mouth slowly as to not draw attention to myself or the situation.  What I end up pulling from my teeth is a twist tie.  The one and the same that you use to secure you bread bags.  I am fairly sure that at least one worker saw me as I examined what appeared to be a tie from a batch of bread that came in on a Friday.  If you didn't know, that means the twist tie was white.  At least I knew the bread was fresh.  Hey, I wasn't going to let that devastate my day, I had to look on the positive side.  Plus I had mac n cheese to distract me from what I just happened.    After finishing my mac n cheese and bottled water, I headed for the trash/recycling and out the door.  Funny thing was, I didn't hear them tell me to \"Enjoy my day.\""}
{"text":"This place is pure Pittsburgh in a no frills package. The folks behind the counter serve up exactly what you expect when you want a sammich. It's clean, fast, friendly, and local. If yinz want a polish ham sammich, go dahn McCoys."}
{"text":"Why go to a crappy chain place when The Real McCoy exists??  Absolutely delicious food here. This is a South Side institution. You can see why this place has been here for so long. Great service with great food. There's no better sandwich on East Carson Street."}
{"text":"Welcome back!  I never went to the last location of the Real McCoy because they didn't have seating inside and honestly it was kinda dingy looking in spite of the good reviews. The new location still doesn't have seating, but it is clean and shiny.   When they re-opened closer to my neck of the woods on Carson Street, I had to check them out to see what the fuss was about. They do make a damned good hoagie - love the pepper relish.   Tips:  * They have been regularly running out of rolls and meats since they re-opened, so make sure you get there early in spite of them saying they are open till 7PM. * You will probably still have to stand in line, but the line does move quickly.  * Enjoy the people-watching as all walks of Pittsburgh life love this establishment - from contractors to businessmen to tattoo artists.  * Order the original with the standard toppings."}
{"text":"The Real McCoy is a South Side staple. It simply \"is what it is\". It's not fancy, it's just honest, inexpensive and delicious. Order the \"Original\" just as it comes. Not sure how a cold hoagie can becomes so much more than a sandwich, but it does! Once you eat there a few times you'll find yourself craving one from time to time."}
{"text":"Loaded with Yinzer personality! Having never tried the Real McCoy I went for the Original, super fresh with an interesting kick.  I knew this place was a winner when the mail carrier and police officer both stop for lunch. Had an interesting conversation with a local South Sider who acted like the North Hills was in Texas.. Gotta love Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Always to good. I went with the original today loaded with everything and some pickles. To full to move!thank u once again best in the Southside."}
{"text":"I remember the first Real McCoy Sandwich I ever had. A friend took me there boasting, \"This is the best sandwich in Pittsburgh!\" That was over thirty years ago. I've gone back many times over the years, always getting the classic Real McCoy to go and I don't think much has change other than the location. As it was back then is as it is today, 'a study in freshness and flavor'."}
