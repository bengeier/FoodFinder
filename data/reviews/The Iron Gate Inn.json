{"text":"Delicious fries, fresh salads, and wonderful variety made for a great lunch downtown.  I have not yet eaten on the patio, but it looks nice.  The staff remembered my requests, which is a good thing.  I will return."}
{"text":"A great new restaurant just opened on 1st Ave, behind my condo (151 Firstside), and I'm real excited to have a bar so close!!   The food is great, and bar is nice...and so is the bartender.  Sunday brunch is catching on as well, with a large variety to choose from.  The menu includes a really good salmon and they have a unique chicken salad that is quite tasty. I don't eat meat, but I understand the steak is really done to your liking.  They have a wine cellar with an excellent selection of wines to suit every taste.  Come down to my hood and visit this great place...Denny Spyra  will love it if you do!!!"}
{"text":"Just got screwed by these people. Came from Florida to have dinner with my Mother on Mothers Day. Had made a reservation a while ago. They called us on Fri afternoon and cancelled our reservation for Sunday. Found out they didn't have enough reservations for a brunch, so they scratched for the day. We have no place to go now on short notice. Sorry but if it were my restaurant I would have cooked for 2 people that day."}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends the other night for the first time. The place is really nice..The courtyard feels like a secret garden..food was very good..I had the salmon with veggies.. Drinks were good also..only thing that shocked me was I ordered at the bar downstairs   2 Grey Goose and sprites and they came to 35.00!  That was WAY too expensive even for NYC/MIA.. so that put me off. One of my friends said she was only charged 10.00 for one of the same drinks.   Otherwise,  the DJ they have there once a month is amazing so I suggest going on that Saturday night"}
