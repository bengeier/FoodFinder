{"text":"I try Thai food everywhere I go and Nunthaporn's Thai Cuisine is my measuring stick.  Their ingredients are always fresh and flavors are awesome.  My favorite is the Green Curry, especially when they have straw mushrooms available .  The restaurant takes pride in preparing their food fresh using only the freshest ingredients.  Do yourself a favor and come when you have time to casually enjoy a quality dining experience."}
{"text":"We have  eaten at some of the best thai restaurants around the world [ including thailand] and I have to say this place is just amazing. every dish we have tried has been a winner.  the curry dishes and  the pad thai are standards for us, and it is a perfect blend of flavour and spice.  If you don't think the food here is great , then you really don't know your food IMHO.  we will be repeating again shortly, just LOVE IT

{"text":"Love the food and have never ordered anything but the Garlic Lover's with chicken since I first tried it.  The only reason I give it 4 out of 5 is that they stop seating way before their advertised closing time and they're also not always open during their listed hours.  I've resorted to always calling and placing take out to be safe."}
{"text":"SUCH. GOOD. THAI!

I had the Pad-See-Ew with chicken and it was wonderful! I am a wimp so I asked for it not spicy and they listened. It was still full of flavor, though, so not to worry. My friend ordered some sort of beef+noodle dish and thought it was great, too. I wish we would have ordered dessert - I'll save that for next time because I'll definitely be going back.

Also, the staff is very friendly, the place is large and extremely clean, and I envy the bathrooms - I wish mine was that nice!"}
{"text":"okay now hubby and I decided to try some of the lunch specials. We ordered drunken noodles, pad see ew, garlic sauce, Thai fried rice,and sweet and sour. (pics coming soon)
the drunken noodles were good, they have a very slight heat and they gave a decent amount of chicken. I would prefer all of their noodles a little more wet though. 
the pad see ew my husband was raving about, the flavor was really good, but again it could be better a little wetter. 
the garlic sauce had areally good flavor in the sauce, but the chicken was a little over cooked, also in all the dishes with carrots, i said no carrots and got them anyway. 
the sweet and sour was good, it had pineapple chunks in it, it was more sweet then any sour. 
the spring rolls were a little chewier than i expected, but surprisingly i actually liked their won ton chips. 
All in all very good thai food, and Its cool they deliver to my house."}
{"text":"Nice place but not good service. I ordered my dish and when I got it it was very spicy. I asked the waiter about it and I was told all dishes like this. All what they did they took it back then put water to tone it down then brought it back, they don't even bother to change the plate....
I like Thai food and this was the first time to hear no degree of spicy available...."}
{"text":"I had the mixed vegetables with chicken and my husband had the cashew with chicken. Both were so delicious!! Will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to eat here for lunch.  I was apprehensive because I have been living in San Diego for over a long time, and I am sorry AZ, but your food just doesn't compare when it comes to exotic/ethnic/culture specific food.  But this restaurant did not disappoint!!!!  Their curry is amazing and the staff are so friendly, attentive and all around great."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night and it was empty. I was leary but also thought about my fellow Yelpers saying that them too were sitting with an empty restaurant and mentioning service was slow. I decided to give it a try since this was the closest restaurant by the Mesa Art Center and we were really hungry after class and boy were we pleasently surprised! 

Ordered the veggie spring rolls that were very delicious btw. Flavors of ginger and pepper with mushrooms and glass noodles and other veggies were really tasty. You can tell they were made fresh and not store bought rolls ( I hate when asiain restaurants do this ).

Lil guy got the vegetarian pad thai and he was very happy...I tried a bite and it definitely wasnt that overpowering sweet sauce they put in other thai places but more of a touch of smokey tamarind sauce...very good!!!

I ordered ( I cant remember for the life of me what it was called but ) a plate of steamed veggies broccoli, carrots, & cabbage combo with fried tofo, served with rice and a side dish of peanut sauce and another side dish of a spicy lime sauce and OMG together the flavors were DELICIOUS!  I must admit, it looked pretty plain when it came out and I was starting to second guess my choice but after I tried it....I knew it was the best decision I made !! Soooo good !!!!

Waiter was nice and helpful but we did have to ask for waters after our food came out. He probably thought we were content with our coffees we brought in but he never even asked us what we wanted to drink. Probably my only complaint there and it really didnt bother us that much since he brought it right out.

Restaurant has plenty of seating. Clean and open. Plenty of tables and booths.
Bathroom was pretty...better decorated than the restaurant ~ odd !
Wait time for our food was minimmal so we were happy about that too!!!

We will definitely be back !!!"}
{"text":"Very cute place, love the decorations. Friendly staff. The lunch special included an egg roll and soup. I don't usually like egg rolls but this one was good, not too big or fried-tasting. My basil fried rice was medium spicy, yum! Great flavor too. Will definitely come back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Too bad they don't care about improving their service. It is awful whether eating in or getting takeout. It's unfortunate because the food is really great."}
{"text":"The service was non existent. The staff all seemed sad and uninspired. The server got our order wrong and after they brought our food we never saw someone again until a random person tossed our bill on the table. We indicated that we actually wanted to order dessert and she looked frustrated and then tersley asked if we knew what we wanted. We told her the mango sticky rice to which she told us they don't serve it now because it's out of season. We said fine we just won't have dessert. She left and we put our card in the bill fold. We then waited 15 minutes for someone to come run the card until we finally had to get up and walk to the front to get the host to run it so we could leave. What's unfortunate is that the food is actually pretty great here. I noticed they had a sign for Server Wanted in the window. Until they fill that vacancy I would not suggest eating at this establishment."}
{"text":"Despite yelp says it was closed on Saturday, it was open when I walked past. I had pad thai at lunch. It came with soup and one spring roll. It was ok; I've had better. The noodle felt rubbery."}
{"text":"Yummy!! We live near by and have been in a few times.  Haven't had a dish we didn't like yet!  The pad Thai is very good and so are the curry dishes.  The service is always friendly, even when the restaurant is really busy.  They are understaffed sometimes, but the food has always been worth waiting for. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"HOT DAMN!!! And I literally mean that!

I've been here a half dozen times and today was my second time having the badass chicken curry noodle soup. The first time I ate in and when they brought out the giant bowl (you could bathe a child in it with ease) I was very pleased. Very balanced curry with a solid kick to it, perfectly cooked noodles, really nothing wrong with it at all. Today was sooo much better though! Ordered it to go pet pet style (Thai hot) and it was like getting hit in the face with a cinderblock covered in chili sauce. And, oddly enough, I am really okay with that. I sat in my cubicle at work sweating and drooling and blowing my nose like a fool all with a giant grin on my face as I gorged myself. 

My lunch buddy always goes for the drunken noodles, very appropriate in her case, and I agree that they are delicious...

I'm not really a fan of their Tom Yum or the Tom Ka though. Then again i might have gone on an off day so i will be more than happy to go back for more tries at the rest of the menu.

One word of warning to my fellow yelpers. For some reason half of their website is in Latin (yes, the actual dead language). Just click around until you get to the printable menu and skip the rest of the website..."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Thai restaurant in our area and it is still a 30 minute drive from our house. Today is the second time that we have gone there and found it closed. The website says they are open for lunch 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM Monday through Saturday. We got there at 12:30 PM and they were closed. It is good food when they are open."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Thai food. The noodles are well seasoned and Penang chicken is perfect! I would have given them 4 stars but the service is slow. They need more wait staff..."}
{"text":"Super lame. Says it is open until 3pm.  I walked in at 2:42 after driving 25 minutes to get here. \"We stop seating at 2:30\". I don't see this posted anywhere online, but there it is at the host desk. We'll have to see if it's worth it. Now I get to eat in the car!  So irritated I can't stand it. If the food is sub par, I will not be back.


Update:  
Food was great - not the best food to eat on the go. We would LOVE to come back and have a dine in experience. 

Updated from a 2 star to a 4 star."}
{"text":"Situated right next to Sweet Cakes I've never noticed this before.  But the Yelp reviews couldn't lie right?

While awaiting my daughter and wife's awesome performance in a choir at the Mesa Arts Center, we walked (yes easy walking distance form MAC) to Nunthaporn's Thai.  Great, welcoming place on Main.

We were seated right away and ordered a few things for our table: satay, wonton soup, etc.  The peanut sauce for the satay left a little to be desired for me, just not what I'm used to I suppose in texture.

I had the Massaman Curry (my fav Thai dish).  It was good, but I felt the chicken could be improved (felt like it was flattened a bit too much).  The curry was excellent and had I not been on a diet I would have eaten the entire dish.

I ordered a noodle/steamed chicken dish for my wife and took it to her...she said it was really good.  Great find in downtown Mesa and if I find myself in the area again, I'll be back."}
{"text":"The food, Service and atmosphere are all excellent. Cooked to perfection, flavors are married together exquisitely.  Don't miss your opportunity to eat here or make it a regular favorite stop. Even though I came before dinner hour and was here during it the service never wavered, they all work together so your always served. Highly recommended it."}
{"text":"Love their red curry chicken.  The reason I am giving them 3 stars instead of four is that when calling in an order for pickup they often give you a wildly inaccurate time leaving you to wait an additional 30+ minutes once you arrive to pickup your order.  This can be frustrating if you've ordered for a client meeting. I've eaten inside their restaurant once and the service was decent and my table was clean and the wait wasn't too bad for the food.  I eat here at least once a month for work (carryout). Their yellow curry is also good and so is their pineapple fried rice."}
{"text":"Food was decent but service was sub par.  Ambience is also just above average. Is decent if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"I guess they don't deliver every night. The first time I called they hung up on my. Don't think I'll be trying them after this."}
{"text":"Why did I not know about the lunch specials?!!?!?

I've been here several times and almost always in the evening. The food never ceases to amaze us. 

I came in today and ordered my favorite, the Evil Jungle Princess. This is a coconut based dish and if you're into coconut, it's a must. Anyway, I couldn't believe that it was only $8. Not only did I get the dish, but they threw in a soup and a tasty little spring roll! 

I've seen other reviewers touch on \"below average\" service and I will admit that the service has been spotty on occasion. However, most of the time they are on point. Today, they were most definitely on point! 

...your on my lunch radar now, Nunthaporn's"}
{"text":"Our first time here.  Very authentic- my husband's been to Thailand many times so he knows authenticity.  Our dishes were delicious and Irvin, the Server, very friendly and efficient.  This will no doubt be one of our regular Thai places to go!"}
{"text":"Really delicious and unexpectedly cute. The booths with their high backs make nice little intimate spaces. (When we walked in we thought it was nearly empty since we couldn't see the people seated in them.)
The owner was so nice. He really wanted to make sure we were happy, and was extra careful to take our used straw wrappers off the table! There was a little confusion about whether we wanted brown or white rice (we'd gone back and forth amongst ourselves so the order wasn't clear) so they just brought us both!
We started with a tureen of Tom ka which was very well balanced and plenty for four people. Then we split pad see ew, spicy eggplant, and pineapple curry (all vegetarian). They were all scrumptious, and the four of us didn't come close to finishing three entrees. And, you cannot pass up the Thai iced tea."}
{"text":"We've only been once so far, but my husband and I had a great experience when we tried this place last month, on a friend's recommendation. Service was great, the waiter and waitress were young but very courteous and fun. The food was fantastic! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"THE WORST SERVICE. Went to a show last night to watch the 730pm Fiddler on the roof. I arrived at 545pm and got a table for 4. The bottle of wine came out without a hitch. Ordered around 6pm and let them know we were here for a show and wanted our food early. At 7pm the waiter informs us that the food is going to be out in 15 minutes! They offered Spring Rolls to make up for it. I can't vouch for the food because when it arrived at 715pm we had 10 minutes to devour it and run to the show. WILL NOT BE GOING BACK."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch and I'm impressed with the quality and flavor. Spicy had a nice flavorful  burn. Thai iced coffee was very good. I'm having the sticky rice with mango for dessert."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place! The staff already know us and our order! My favorite Thai place in the valley!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Pineapple Curry is great!  Lots of great flavors and just a little spice.  Pineapple and cashew rice is also very good.  The Evil jungle princess had fresh ingredients and put together well but it wasn't for me.  I will try Larb and a few other things next time and rereview.  Place was packed when we went but not a long wait to get a table."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants in the area. Eat here on a regular basis. Love the Drunken Noodles and curries.  Lunch menu is great value for money."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai with vermicelli noodles is absolutely fantastic! And the curries... so good. The sauces are what make the food really shine, especially the sauce from the mixed vegetable dish. The menu indicates vegetarian dishes and which can be made gluten-free, which is also a plus."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how many times I have been to Nunthaporn's Thai! This place has become the standard for Thai food for me! I always seem to come back and compare it to the other Thai food around Arizona! You can pick your protein (Chicken, Pork, Tofu or Shrimp) with almost anything on the menu! They even have great lunch options, both price and options!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great tasting food. Nice atmosphere. And the help is super friendly. And Any place that lets me come back the next day to pay the bill because I left my wallet home you know is customer oriented. Yes I did that and they were super nice about it."}
{"text":"Our party of four had lunch here on Thursday. I'm not sure how long they've been open but I just noticed this great addition to downtown Mesa a week ago. The lunch specials are very reasonable and the portions generous. The appetizer & soup were a yummy surprise. The service was gracious without being too too. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very delicious! Came during lunch and tried Tom Kha and their lunch special Yellow Curry. It was very delicious. The waiter was super kind and gave good suggestions. It was very busy but the service was still good. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"about the 5th time , have eaten here.  Thai food is my all time favorite, and this was good standard, especially at lunchtime.  Out of my general range, and construction woes keep me away.   Went there today, after a long drive from Payson ,and had to pick up car from $1,000 repair, so was in area, with mom, and thought yum.  Went thru the back door.  about 10 people standing up front.  Asked them, what is wait? they said don't know, have been standing here at least 10 mins, some longer.  many empty tables, but full house waiting.  One waiter, and I guess a table clearer?.  We decided to leave, walking towards back, waiter stopped us and said, can put you at a table and bring water but 30-35 mins for food. Asked if someone out sick? He said no ,normal. That is just unacceptable.  was 1240 pm when got there.  If that is common, they need more wait and kitchen staff.    Mom said, lets just try it -so sat.  Many people upset, some leaving as soon as they came in after talking to those up front. .  Waiter and clearer working like crazy, seemed frenzied, stressed, and thought both were going to bolt out the door.  Lady next to us w/husband left, had to get to dr apt, so had finally gotten soup, but never got lunch.  She told husband to bring it home. Both were really upset.  Staff kept apologizing.   Finally, the  clearer guy, brought us soup about 25 mins after sat down.  It was not even warm.  spring roll came with, dry, chewy and barely warm.  then food came.  I ordered Evil Jungle princess that I get there often.  Didn't look remotely the same.  My mom said, that isn't what you ordered, tell him.  I said no, will just eat it.  Not going to wait for another order.   As long as no seafood all thai to me is good, and I was having a bad day already. Wouldn't have mattered as we couldn't get him to come back, glad some water on table for refill. The  restaurant started  clearing out, some sort of calm returned and we were able to pay bill.  but all in all stressful, disappointing experience for all the diners, and felt sorry for the staff.  Mom liked her food, other than wasn't very warm.  But she remembers it \"being so much better last time\".  So another thai restaurant crossed off the list. Don't think would even eat there if needing something before Mesa theater play"}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  Portions were bountiful.  I ordered the lunch version of the pad thai and was pretty impressed.  The chicken used had a nice charcoal flavor but it needed a bit more heat.  For someone who likes spicy food, order it #4 or #5 in terms of heat.  I would come back here again.

Update 2/6/15
Terrible service.  Slow to serve drinks.  Brought out wrong food and didn't apologize.  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Please tell your chef (and kitchen staff) that fish sauce should be used sparingly. Seriously. The papaya salad got to the table and the horrible smell nearly knocked us out of our seats. The taste was just as bad. Menu item #503, Pra Rham, was bland. One of the side sauces was inedible. Not once did our server ask how our food was. Waste of food, waste of money, waste of time."}
{"text":"Good Thai food but slow service. It's downtown Mesa so I understand that staffing is a problem but we had one server to the entire restaurant who was also the hostess & and responsible for bussing the tables. Needless to say he was overwhelmed and got our order wrong and didn't check on us much. 
The food is good but NOTE..... Their spice levels are waaaayyy off. And I can handle spice. They range from 1-5 and we ordered a 2 because the last time our food was too spicy to finish. A 2 should not make your nose run and tongue feel like it's burning off. A 2 should be delightful with a touch of spice. A 4 or 5 should get you're taste buds heated. So once again we couldn't finish our Green Curry because it was too hot. Other than that we did enjoy the freshness of the food and the fried tofu was great."}
{"text":"I've had pretty good luck trying places with few reviews but high ratings, and Nunthaporn's is no exception.

We went at around dinner time on a weekday and found plenty of street parking right in front of the restaurant. 

The inside is Thai reminiscent without being over-the-top or wannbe-trendy.  Plenty of seating and I didn't see any 2-top tables, which I like because I generally eat with a friend of mine and between the amount of food we order and how tall we are 2-tops generally make me claustrophobic.

The service here was great, prompt seating and order.  The menu is as expected for a Thai restaurant with about 60 dishes in all in various categories.  I had the red curry and my friend had the yellow.  We also had an order of 'Thai toast' which was a lightly fried pastry with chicken inside and covered in a sweet & sour sauce.  

The curry was delicious, though the menu lead me to believe it was going to be a little more spicy.  I have fond memories of eating in small restaurants in southern Thailand and having my tongue chemically removed by spicy seafood dishes.  Next time I will try the only item (that I saw) on the menu with a four star spicy rating.

On the way out I saw two separate large parties dining and they had ordered some dishes family-style, which came in large two-tier serving bowl/platters and looked extremely tasty, so I would definitely recommend bringing larger groups here.

The prices were very reasonable and I was really happy with the quality of the food.  I will definitely be coming back often, especially since Char's on Rural / University is gone.  Overall this restaurant is probably more of a 4.5 star, but I will round up this time to keep the rating :)"}
{"text":"Best Thai food ever. I highly recommend it. The price was very reasonable, and service was excellent. Really hope this place makes it!! Downtown is so in need of good quality places like this."}
{"text":"4.5 stars! One of our recent attempts at replacing Mint Thai...

Service was good, totally friendly, small/quaint atmosphere. Prices seemed normal, nothing outrageous.

Food was tasty! And if \"thai hot\" isn't hot enough, they'll bring out thai chilies, some sort of crazy thai powder, and a paste. Definitely kicks it up a notch to the desired level.

So many choices, we have to go back!"}
{"text":"Great spot in downtown Mesa. Every time I come here I have ordered something different. I've gotten Pad Thai, Curry Chicken and this time I got Thai Fried Rice. My girlfriend got Pad See Ew so we were able to mix it up and share everything. This last visit earned it an extra star. 

Service has been inconsistent. I've had really fast service, and really slow service. This time was really fast. The food tasted the best ever too! We also asked to make the food very spicy and they listed. We did have to reassure them a few times that we can handle it. I guess they have a lot of people who want spicy but can't handle it. 

This place has a great ambiance to it, I can see it being pretty romantic at night but I've only eaten here for lunch.  

In addition... I always get a small egg roll and some soup with every meal which is very tasty."}
{"text":"I promise this is a restaurant that you will crave once you have tried it. I thought it was just me who thought my red curry was the best I have ever had. Fresh and very flavorful. I had been there for lunch, then took the family during the Second Friday Night event in Downtown Mesa last month. It is all they talk about when we say we are going out to dinner-even the 12 year old! Of course we will be there again this month on the second friday. The merchants have a motorcycle event planned, should be fun to walk around and check out the bikes.
The price is very reasonable so taking the family to a nice sit down dinner is within the budget- even though the food is great you will still have leftovers as the servings are large. You will not be let down by this place."}
{"text":"Love the spring rolls!! The sauce is a tiny bit runnier than I personally like but it is delicious none the less!"}
{"text":"Yaaaay!
Finally! A fantastic ethnic eatery for downtown Mesa!

I stopped by today for carry-out. it was their first day in business, and everyone was so excited and helpful. Of course the food is so good and so fresh-tasting. Good for the soul.

Although I didn't get a whole \"sit-down\" experience, I'm giving 5 stars because I love these guys so much (this is the old Benjarong!!). If you think I sound biased then maybe you should check it out for yourself.

The new space looks awesome- very handsomely done."}
{"text":"I haven't been for a while and honestly can't remember what dishes I've ordered but I can say that the first time I went there I was hooked.   The food is fresh and delicious!  I know once I got pad see ew and I loved it.  The first time it was a curry, but I honestly don't remember which one.  I was excited when I saw their take-home menu offering delivery.  I called once and they said they only deliver when they have extra staff... and as others have noted, that's rarely the case.  So needless to say I was disappointed that they didn't deliver because they're FAR better than the local Thai restaurants that DO deliver.

And a note about people complaining about waiting for food: IT'S A SIT-DOWN RESTAURANT. IF YOU WANT YOUR FOOD RIGHT NOW GO TO MCDONALD'S!"}
{"text":"I am a very picky Asian when it comes to Asian food. I usually am NOT very generous with my rating when it comes to quality of foods and services, but I have to give Nunthaporn a rating of 4 for their good food and friendly service. There is not that many good Thai restaurants in Phoenix Metropolitan area. One day, I tumbled into this mom and pop restaurant in downtown Mesa and have been going since 2011. The food is amazing. Their lunch portions are generous and the egg rolls are good. Okay, I am picky with egg rolls too because I do know how to make egg rolls The chef, kitchen staff and servers are friendly. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to try."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and picked up to go lunch a dozen times. I have tried different meals including the Garlic lovers, Cashew chicken, and my usual is the yellow curry. I love that they give you 2 soups when you tell them you are gluten free, in an effort to replace the spring rolls. I love the yellow curry but this review is actually for the THAI FRIED RICE!

Last week I went in for lunch and took the servers advice to do the Thai Fried Rice (gluten free style) and it was fantastic!! I was shocked at every bite. When it was served, it appeared a bit boring. However, each bite was something light and fresh. Chicken, peas, egg, tomatoes, carrots. It really had impressive flavor. I will absolutely go back for this meal!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times everything I have tried is excellent. The service was not very good at first, but they have improved a lot and I have no complaints now. The Pad Thai, Drunken Noodles, and Cashew Chicken are my favorites."}
{"text":"wow, 2 and a half years since my other review? They are doing much better than when they first opened. My wife has eaten there several times recently, she and I ate there last week. Seems default spicy level is mild. It's not a big place, so it fills up. One of the better restaurants in downtown Mesa, and convenient to the Mesa Arts Center. Last week we got there just after 6pm, beat the rush, had a good dinner and made our 7pm show at the MAC."}
{"text":"I was here for business and ate here twice in a row and even took my niece and her husband.  Great food, reasonable prices.  I'd go back in a heartbeat.  Both nights we went there was zero wait time."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai cuisine with large portions for around $10!  Our go to dishes are : Pad Thai (any of the meats are great), Pad See Ew with beef, Yellow Curry with Pork and Evil Jungle Princess.  We love taking first timers here they are always committed to coming back!  Oh and their sticky rice with coconut ice cream for dessert is divine!!!"}
{"text":"Very good Thai food.  I ordered the Red Curry.  It had fresh meat and veggies in a delicious curry.  My friend had the Curry Noodle Soup and she said it was delicious.  This warm food was perfect for a cold, rainy night.  The restaurant was very clean and seemed to be well managed.  My friend and I noticed that although there were only a few tables with guests, it was very loud and echo-y inside, which made it difficult to have a conversation.  Nice location, but limited parking as it is located in downtown Mesa on Main St.  I'd recommend parking behind the Le Studio Hair Salon instead of trying to parallel park on Main."}
{"text":"A nice Thai restaurant across the street from The Mesa Arts Center. Our dinner was delicious and spiced just right. My husband had the yellow curry with pork & I had green curry with pork. Both were very good. Spring rolls & won ton soup also winners. The service was great and they were busy, restaurant was full. I would definitely go back for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I would give this place more than 1 star because I love the food, but unfortunately the last few times I have tried to eat there they will not serve me. 

The first incident I showed up before their closing time of 3pm and they informed me they were no longer seating anyone for lunch, and this was around 2:30pm. 

Today I showed up 30 minutes prior to closing and yet again I am told the same thing. We are closed for lunch and only doing take out orders that have already been placed. 

Are you kidding me? Do you want customers or not?! If your last seating is truly 30 minutes prior to closing, then just change your hours to 2:30pm if you want people out of there. It's extremely disappointing to show up to eat some food you love only to find out the time on the door really means 30 minutes prior. 

Really sad for a place that has great food. Too bad I keep missing it."}
{"text":"Can't say I swing through downtown Mesa that often, but we may have to do it more often to get some Thai. This is one of my favorite cuisines, and everything was so tasty we brought home leftovers. We never do that as it usually just leads to horrific fungal growths as it sits uneaten for a few weeks, but not this time.

Great food, good service, wonderful little place."}
{"text":"Favorite Thai place and I love Thai food

Their pad Thai is just the best. Hands down.

Love the Penang curry and green curry fried rice! Great balance and amazing flavor.

I like heat and they can dial it up!  A 3 is more than for most people. I order a 4 which is pretty blazing.

Actually only thing I have had there that  was not perfect was the Larb. Balance with the heat was needed and we got it at a 3!

Yes, it's quiet, which is how my wife and I like to dine out.

Only once was service slow. Mostly just right!

The only drawback is the name. Sorry but in US you can't have that word in the name of your restaurant if you want normal people to come in :)"}
{"text":"My wife and i went there last night at 8:30. Turns out they close the seating 30 minutes before closing time. In fact they pointed to the sign they have posted next to the cash register. We were offered take out.  So get there early so you can try their food."}
{"text":"Just happened a couple of minutes ago.

Called in at roughly 6:10 PM, was told it would take 15-20 minutes to make the food.

So I get there at 6:30 PM in order to be there when it's hot. The server proceeded to tell me that we called in and asked for 6:45 (False). So whatever, it's good food, I waited for about another 15 minutes (after already calling it in) before this kid hands me a bag. (I didn't think I needed to check it).

I get home and it's not my food. I mean, I understand if I have to wait for hot food. I understand if it is busy and someone makes a mistake. But they made me wait 15 minutes to just give me the wrong food and then ask me to \"come pick it up\" after? Nope.

Made them refund my card. Kept the other food (which was tofu when I am a meat enthusiast.)

It's so sad because their food is really good. But that service has been awful. If you have a lot of extra time to spare, go here for good food. Just don't expect to have a unspoiled meal, in some way, those people will mess it up."}
{"text":"I love this place. Been plenty of times, never had bad service as mentioned in some other reviews. It's not, like, fast food, but the food has always come out in a reasonable time frame, it's DELICIOUS, and a great location. I eat a lot of Thai food and Nunthsporn is one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! Waited over a hour for our food and the place was not that busy. We were sitting outside and the waiter forgot to place our order with the kitchen. The staff was clueless and did not care - no apologies. They even tried to charge us for food they did not deliver. We will not recommend this place or be back!!!"}
{"text":"Soooo it's been a while since me and my fiancé have been, and I am pretty disappointed. The food is subparb, definitely not what it used to be and the service? Wow! Awful. Our server acted like he didn't give a crap about his customer service, we had to initiate everything! And it took 15 minutes for 1 glass of wine... It wasn't even busy. When we were done eating another girl, who looked like she was pilled out the whole time didn't ask if we needed anything else, just asked if we received our check. When she brought it to us, she bitched about people telling her to do a million things... Like really? The duration we were there she was only cleaning tables and acted like customers were a hassle, BTW she cleaned about 10 tables in 45 minutes. When we left, not even a goodbye or have a nice night. I can honestly say I only gave a 2 star because of the food. Nunthaporns used to have good waiters and waitresses. 3 women were there before us, you coukd tell they haddent been served yet, and left when we were helped first.. Idk what happened, but they probably would have gotten at least a 4 star had they acted like they gave a shit. Sorry to say that I'll never come back. Hopefully the managers read these and take these reviews into consideration."}
{"text":"We were with friends in downtown Mesa and all of us were hungry. One couple had eaten here before, so we decided to try it. I tried the Massaman with chicken and my husband had the pad seemed. Both were surprisingly flavorful and delicious. Service was good and the food came out quickly. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My visit was happenstance.  I google \"Papaya restaurant  in Mesa\" on my phone and the results included Nunthaporn's. Happy to report that venturing off my list was a hit. Papaya remains on my places to eat bucket list.  We shared the papaya salad - I'm looking forward to my leftovers. I had a red curry dish with eggplant, fried tofu, carrots, mushrooms and more. ( Man the tofu was the best ever.) I was humming \"ummmmmm\" after the first bite.  I'm doing it now trying to see if I have the right phonetic spelling... well anyway you know what I mean.  I spiked my to-go portions with the green chili condiment in brine, so good. After asking our lovely waitress how to pronounce Nunthaporn,  I will tell friends about a great Thai restaurant on Main that starts with an \"N.\"  Will I go back?  Yes, yes and yes please.  Eat Happy!"}
{"text":"Food was not sensational but typical Thai dishes.  I had the pad thai lunch special. I wanted the Larb but they don't serve that at lunch even though they gave me the menu with it on there.  I was very rushed to eat and leave even though I had an hour before they closed. The greater was very rude and the place was empty. I like to go to places where the atmosphere is inviting and for that and the basic food, I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The food sucks and the service is worst.I won't go there ever again.The time there open to 9:00 Pm but if you get there at 8:30 they won't sevre you bad experience."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place, My friends were wrong

They seemed a little busy, asked to place a take out order and was met with an extremely quick and rude come back in an hour. Really?"}
{"text":"I went here a month or so ago, and forgot to write my review, but I remember the whole lunch very well because it was such a terribly disappointing experience. I desperately wanted to like this place, because I work so close and love Thai food, but it was just not a good experience. The food wasn't horrible, but nothing that made me want to come back, and the service was awful. 

I'll start with the food. I ordered the Pra-Rahm lunch special. At the time I went, it was described as coming with a Spicy and Peanut Sauce. I took this as being one sauce, and this was exactly what I was looking for. However, when they brought it out, I found that these were two completely separate sauces. One was a very watery, spiced sauce, and the other was an incredibly thick, very sweet peanut sauce. The two didn't mix well, and neither really had that flavor I was looking for. The spicy one wasn't hot, rather just had a lot of spices in it. The peanut sauce was too thick and sweet for my tastes (would have been much better on top of some kind of dessert, in my opinion). The chicken and vegetables I had were cooked well, but I couldn't enjoy them because of the sauces.

Now, I'll talk about the service. The entire place was being served by only two servers. Not that this place is huge, but there are probably 25ish tables in there, which is far too many for 2 people, if you want any service at all. On top of that, I managed to overhear one server talking and learned that one of the servers was training. So, really, there were only about 1.5 servers working. There is seemingly no organization as to which server helps with table, either. I walked in and was taken to a table by one server. I looked at the menu for a few minutes, decided on the Pra-Rahm, and set it down to wait for my server to return. 15 minutes went by before someone returned. The server that returned asked what I wanted to drink, and left. They came back with water, and didn't ask for my order, walking away again. It wasn't until I had been sitting for about 30 minutes that someone took my order. That, to me, is an absolutely ridiculous amount of time. Every time one of the two servers working walked by, they would make eye contact, and then look for the other, like they thought the other person was supposed to be taking care of me. It's not that they weren't friendly on the rare occasion that they made it to my table, they just didn't take care of their duties as servers. I could see the manager working, handling the to-go orders, but she wasn't doing much. You would think that the manager would help serve, since that was where the restaurant really needed help (not many to-go orders coming through), but she just watched and walked back into the kitchen. I was more patient than many others who had come in after me, as I watched them leave, but I wish I had followed their lead, because I probably would have ended up at Sweet Cakes, which is next door. Some of you think that the manager probably had other things to do, they couldn't possibly help, but that isn't true. I worked in a restaurant for almost 2 years, and during the meal rushes is usually the least busy time for managers, they end up helping out everyone else most of the time. Its toward the ends of the shifts and days that they have a pile-up of managerial duties to take care of.

All-in-all, this was just a terrible experience, and I can't see myself returning here when I can guarantee a great lunch experience next door at Sweet Cakes."}
{"text":"We have been going to Nun's for years.  I need the Evil Jungle Princess 12-step program.  It's just that good and, as you can imagine, I'm powerless.  The Hubstud always gets #611.  I can't even tell you what it is because mine renders me semi- conscious.  Just go, you'll thank me."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner before a show at the Mesa Arts Center, as this is one of the only dining establishments within walking distance (go downtown Mesa!).  It went something like this:

6:15 PM: Arrive, sit down right away
6:20 PM: Someone takes our order
6:30 PM: Waiter says he'll check on our food
6:45 PM: Waiter says he'll check on our food
6:50 PM: Waiter says our food will be out in two minutes
6:55 PM: We get our food
7:10 PM: Finished eating
7:15 PM: We get our bill
7:20 PM: We finally get to leave.

Yes, it took over half an hour to make two bowls of curry.

I understand it's the dinner rush, and that there is a show across the street, but you have access to their schedule!  Make sure you hire some people so you're not under staffed!

Besides that, the food was not that great.  Maybe I got a bad bowl, but it was incredibly watery, and the chicken was dry and overcooked."}
{"text":"This place was a welcome relief after a family tragedy, we gathered here after visiting the funeral home on two different days.  My local family was familiar with it from their past visits.  They host was very friendly and accommodating and treated us with great service, the second visit we went in the second room which wasn't usually open for lunch.  The service was nice and reasonably fast and efficient, great place for a filling Thai meal, the curry dishes were straighforward and comfortable, with chewy brown rice the way I like it."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good! Such a hidden gem. There service is great and the food is wonderful. I went in during the lunch hour. I was greeted and seated immediately. I was served my food within fifteen minutes of the waitress taking my order. I ordered pad Thai with shrimp and it was delicious. Good portion size, too. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and service. I got the Drunken noodles which were excellent. Its clean and is a pretty typical thai place. One thing is the hours are kinda limiting. I was there on a Thursday night, and they stopped seating people at 8:15. That is a little bit extreme, its not even dark by then in the summer. I have to deduct 2 stars for that, because that is really stupid to do."}
{"text":"I love this place but rarely go to Downtown Mesa. I was so happy to find them on UberEats. Hands down best customer service I've had in quite some time. They called to clarify my order and made adjustments right then without me having to reorder. The food is even more amazing than I remember. By far will be my go-to Thai place!"}
{"text":"The food was decent. Not \"omg best Thai food I've ever had\" - but decent quality standard American restaurant Thai food.

Sadly, the service was horrible. Really, really bad. 

When we arrived, the teenage girl working the cash register looked at us when we said that we had a party of 2 and looked back at the half empty restaurant and said \"oh, you have to have a reservation\" - WTF? \"Oh, just kidding.\" 

Um, gotta work on your delivery hon, because it wasn't funny. 

Then we sat. 10 minutes later she strolled by and took our drink order. Then she came back to take our food order (no, we didn't have our drinks yet.) 10 minutes after that we got our iced teas. Much later we got our food slammed down on our table  (literally) by the other waitress. They never, ever checked back with us - if they had, they would have learned that my husband's food was made spicy, mine wasn't - which was the reverse of what we had asked for. Never cleared our plates. We had to ask for our check after we had been done (with dirty plates sitting in front of us) forever. 

Mind you, this was in a half empty restaurant.

Lame. You clearly have untrained servers who either don't care what they are doing or just don't know the basics of food service. 

Get some servers who have a clue - waiting tables is a pretty simple process and there are basic steps to it. Greet, take drink order, serve drink order, take food order, deliver food, check back to see if everything is ok, keep an eye on the table to see when they are done, clear plates and offer dessert, bring check, take money. See? Not hard."}
{"text":"As a long time Mesa resident, I was excited when a friend wanted to take me to her new fave with the weird name. OMG. Please, thai this one on. 
The Thai toast is so good, with a sweet sauce that comes with making it one of my favorite apps ANYWHERE. 
Best entrees, Evil Jungle Princess, Black Pepper Shrimp, Green Curry, Pad See Ew (sp?) and the Laarb salad. 
Great service, including sodas that are free refills (not from the fountain!) and good prices make this one of my favorite Mesa eats. Only downside is that there's never enough rice and they make you pay for more..."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. I learned how to properly order a Singha \"Singh\" without \"ha\".  Moo was my waiter and took the time to explain the meaning of Singha.  I ordered the Jungle Curry and it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I love this place. the food is authentic, they are her family own recipes. I especially love the red curry and the pad thai."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding there is love in everything she serves.  Her heart is the restaurant and food.
Nun is a sweetheart and a great chef.  Her dishes are consistent and fresh.

I Cant say enough good about this place.  We would eat here every dinner out night.  

We have tried numerous things on the menu and have never been disappointed,  soups are hot and fresh.  Made to order is her motto.

One last tip NEVER leave without having sticky rice and gelato it's fabulous. Should be illegal!"}
{"text":"We have been ordering take out from here for years and the Evil Jungle Princess is the best...my wife and I can't get enough of it!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner due to the fact that we were visiting a nearby music store in search of a piano to purchase.

We had been intending on dining here on several occasions, but would get sidetracked by other shinier establishments along the way. Old Downtown Mesa is quite sparse in terms of activity, and after 7PM, activity dies down tremendously unless there is an event at the nearby Mesa Arts Center.

Why only 3 stars, you may ask?

Let's start out with the Satay Skewers. Although there were a generous amount of skewers, and they advertise that these were grilled and marinated in a home-style sauce; these were effectively quite bland. If it weren't for the peanut sauce that it came with, I would venture to say that these were practically flavorless. 

For something to be marinated, the expectation is that the marinade permeates the beef and adds an inherent flavor to it, even without the dipping sauce. Such was not the case here.

We had the same experience with the Cashew Chicken. The sauces were good, but the meat itself was quite tasteless. Not something that we were expecting from a typical Thai restaurant  wherein the distinct flavors of the dishes need any prompting or extraction. The flavors should exude from the meats due to the prolonged preparation.

The yellow curry had promise. Although not as spicy as I am accustomed to, my wife had requested that it be very mild. And that is exactly what she got! Not their fault on this dish. It just wasn't a yellow curry without the curry kick to it.

A few positives did come to light. For one, the fried banana desserts, with and without the Gelato were stupendous and absolutely delightful. They certainly woke up our palates after having experienced the restrained entrees.

Another positive was the service. Both gentlemen servicing us were very prompt and attentive. Never a moment went by where they didn't check up on us. Drinks were promptly filled, and dishes were quickly done away with.

We will probably give this place another chance, and order different dishes the next time - hoping that something will enliven our palates during our next visit."}
{"text":"This is a great find in downtown Mesa.  I have only delighted in the lunch menu, which is $7.00 for chicken, pork, beef or fried tofu. Add $2.00 for shrimp or fish. As you are looking over the menu, you are automatically served an appetizer and soup of the day. I've eaten here twice this summer and the food has been wonderful both times.  This last Friday I enjoyed a lunch of Massamon curry chicken in coconut milk with roasted peanuts, potatoes and onions with Jasmine Rice.  So good!  I treated myself to a glass of Thai ice tea--I think of it as a desert, because it is so sweet.

Check out this restaurant (I'm sure it will become a favorite) and then walk over to the Mesa Arts Center and see the exhibits at Mesa Contemporary Arts. It is good for the digestion and the soul."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a few of my supervisors a week ago and at first glance, liked that it was a nice quaint little place. The food was great-no complaints, we all enjoyed it. But the service was questionable. Our waitress looked like she wanted to shoot herself the whole time she talked to us-or anyone for that matter. She did not smile. Not Once. And she never came by to refill our drinks or ask how we were doing. She mumbled and when asked to speak up, gave attitude the whole time she spoke up. I gave her the benefit of the doubt because I used to be a waitress but she didn't at least try to be warm and welcoming. The other waiter seemed nice and smiley though, I think we might have just caught her on a wrong day perhaps? Great food though! Very tasty!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at many thai restaurants and this place is great! One of the best.  They will accommodate my spicy palette and throw in some extra chili's for me as well. If you are in the downtown Mesa area I recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp after going to the Mesa Arts Center, which this place is literally across the street from.

It's on the strip of the newly reimagined Mesa Downtown area, it's a fun and vibrant area that will hopefully come to life in the coming years - this place will is definitely a reason to return to Downtown Mesa.

It's a cute little spot, with a decent sized dining room that was unfortunately basically empty when I arrived with a friend. We really hoped this place lived up to the reviews.

I had the Tamarind Shrimp and oh my gosh, this may be one of the best dishes I've ever had from any Thai place. The serving was huge and I was confident I couldn't finish it but as I kept eating I couldn't stop because the flavor profile was so rich and vibrant. 

I cannot wait to come back to try other menu items, because so far this place is a home run."}
{"text":"We went on Saturday evening for dinner. We were seated quickly and orders were taken in timely manner.

We ordered our usual for anytime we visit a Thai restaurant for the first time. We ordered Tom Ka hot pot, pad thai and panang curry.

First: The water. They have a carafe filled on table so you can refill your own water. Great idea for someone who drinks a lot but it's not kept cold and they won't refill your ice. The hot pot was good but not lit. Where's my fire? They added onion, which is not traditional, but okay. Not much root or leaves either. The pad thai was very sweet and no heat. They didn't even ask if I'd like it spicy or not. It's more common that they will ask how hot you want your dish but not at Nunthaporn. It was still good, just a little too sweet for my taste and not nearly enough heat. The panang curry was good but nothing special. Again, not much heat. They could have added more fish sauce to as the coconut was way too prominent. Basically, good food but I've had better.

My main problem comes from the service. The wait staff wasn't attentive and that's fine. At least it didn't take long for the food to come out. But it was how they handled the bill. My total was just over $28 and I had a gift card for $25. We paid with the gift card and advised I will pay the rest and tip on my debit card. The manager came by our table with the waitress and advised me I couldn't pay using my card because it was under $5. What?!? With the tip, it would have been definitely over $5 and not only that, it wasn't like my bill was $3. My bill was $28 so it shouldn't have mattered. It wasn't even that I was trying to pay with 2 different debit cards, just one. Either way, they would occur a fee for card usage. I argued the point with the manager but they didn't care. I don't carry cash and advised them they would have to use the card and they refused. Luckily, I had a $10 gift card to Main St. (accepted at any business on Main St) so I had to use the $10 card and put the rest on the gift card, leaving a small balance on the gift card. Of course I had no cash and they wouldn't let me tip with the gift card so I had no way to tip them. I guess they didn't want to be tipped.

I'll probably give the remaining gift card away as I don't plan on returning. Their food was nothing special and there are other Thai restaurants in the valley that are better."}
{"text":"The least spicy Thai food I have ever had. If you are on the fence about thai and want something mild, this place is for you. 

For me it was pretty boring."}
{"text":"My friends and I had dinner here tonight. Everyone enjoyed their meal and the service was good."}
{"text":"Does a review count if it's a regular weekday lunch spot steps away from where you work?

The veggie options are predictably good here.  Spicy eggplant with tofu is my go-to dish.  I usually ask for it thai-hot to get the appropriate swelter going.  

Their service is, as other reviewers have mentioned, sometimes uneven. (The restaurant is in downtown Mesa.  I imagine it's infuriatingly difficult to predict when things will be actually busy.)   However, the food is genuinely delicious, and a welcome option to break up the sandwich-heavy monotony of downtown dining options."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I can no longer recommend this place.

Stopped by last night to discover yet another new crop of waiters who know nothing about the menu. While no surprises there, over the past year the food quality had slid to the point I can no longer taste those unique Thai spices that put Nunthaporn's on the map. No doubt the ingredients are now sourced from the Lei Lei supermarket Thai aisle. Just like every other Thai restaurant in town. Not to mention the menu continues to shrink with absolutely nothing new.

Congratulation Nunthaporn's on your entry into the local Lazy Thai Cuisine Union of Phoenix ... the LTCU.

It's obvious the chef's/owner's no longer care. 

Well guess what ... neither do I."}
{"text":"My man and I went here to get dinner on a date last night and we were both presently surprised at how good the food was!

Originally, he had thoughts of wanting to go to Temari but this place was closer to our show and so we went with it.

Servers were nice, but we showed up a little before closing so we seemed to be more of an afterthought as they hustled trying to clean everything up. Not a big deal to me since each time they did come they were friendly. 

Food was great! We got the Masaman Curry and I got the Pra Rham with Satay chicken skewers to share. Everything had great flavor, especially the curry. Appetizer was a little pricey but actual meals are cheap, so it evens out. 

Even though my boyfriend was a little sad we didn't go to Temari, he did bashfully admit that this place had awesome food and ate every last morsel on his place. So if you would like some good Thai, hit this place up!"}
{"text":"This place deserves more stars for their food, but their service was so horrible that I can't bring myself to go higher than 2.

At first, all seemed well.  Quick service for the menu, drinks and soup/eggroll that came with my lunch special ($7 by the way, a great deal for all the food you get).

But after I got my Drunken Noodles (very tasty) , I never saw the waitress again.  Even though I made a point to put my empty glass at the edge of my table, my eyes begging for a refill each time she walked by, but she was just too busy to bother.  I eventually gave up on the hope of getting more soda and finished my meal and again, trying to give a signal that I'm ready for my bill, pushed my empty plate to the edge of the table.  She rushed back and forth a few times and glanced at the empty plate and glass, but still not bothering to stop by.

I eventually got up and walked over to the other waitress at the computer station and told her I wanted to pay.  Very frustrating to say the least.

The food is great but the service ruined the experience for me.  Sadly, I will not be returning here.  You can find me at Thai Rama in Chandler instead."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Mesa hands down.  Get the Thai fried rice and the sweet and sour chicken.  Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! We have finally found a GREAT Thai place! I have been eating Thai food for many years and I have found some very good Thai places in the valley. However none have been as good as Nunthaporn!

We were greeted right away and customer service was excellent the whole time we were there. The owner came out and talked to us and was very pleasant. She told us if anything wasn't to our liking to let her know and she would correct it. Needless to say we found nothing to complain about. She said that all the dishes were her mother's recipes and that the dishes are prepared just like they prepare them in Thailand. I haven't been to Thailand so I'll have to take her word for it, but the food was wonderful. 

We both agreed that the Wonton Soup is the best we have had. Both dishes we got were wonderful. With everything tasting and looking very fresh. We can't wait to go back and try more dishes!

Thai food lovers, you will not be disappointed! I highly recommend Nunthaporn Thai Cuisine!"}
{"text":"I love the food here.  They'll make it as spicy as you want, and they know spicy!  Seriously, it's so annoying to order something extra hot and not even have a slight burn.  You will not have this problem with Nunthaporn.  The food is flavorful, the staff is helpful, their Thai ice tea is DELISH!  My favorite Thai restraurant as far as the food goes.  The decor is cute but they are a little understaffed.  Either way, it doesn't stop me from eating there.  I just choose to go during a less busy time of day."}
{"text":"Because I had a gift certificate, I had to try this restaurant.  I placed my order to go.  I ordered the Pad See Ew with beef and my DH ordered the panang curry with chicken.  I was lucky enough to find a parking space in front of the restaurant.  It was ready when they said it would be and it smelled great. I was hungry.  My husband said his curry was spicy but since I wasn't asked how spicy I wanted it, it must only come one way, spicy.  My dish was a little disappointing because the beef and broccoli weren't fresh and the noodles were all broken but the good thing is, it wasn't too oily.  I will go back and try something else because I have more gift certificates to use.  Nice decor and lots of seating and professional staff."}
{"text":"The food is good, if you can get any. Too many times a quick lunch turns into 2 plus hours. Painfully slow and understaffed, top this off with extreme rudeness and you have a recipe for disaster. The final straw was arriving for dinner before a Mesa Art Center performance, note that we arrived two and a half hours before we had to leave,  we sat at a table for twenty minutes, yes we timed it, before getting noticed and served drinks.  Checked the watch,  another ten minutes before or orders were taken.  Click is ticking. ..fifteen minutes go by and one appetizer appears,  one cup of soup.  Twenty minutes goes by,  no more appetizers arrived. Now, we are worried that we will not get the other apps, much less our main courses. With fifteen minutes before or show,  we left in disgust.  walked across the street to Mangos and explained our predicament.  Half starved,  the wonderful folks at mangos quickly fed us and we made our concert.  I can't believe this place stays in business."}
{"text":"Impossibly rude, out-of-touch and unwelcoming. Paid for a $10 Uber to come here because I was excited for the food. Walked in to a hostess who said nothing to me, and a 5 minute wait. Fast forward, and a waiter walking through the entrance says \"no more to-go food.\"

\"Oh sorry, no we're not getting food to go, we'd like to eat here.\"

\"No food to go I said, okay. No food to go.\"

\"Right, we would like to eat here.\"

\"We're closed for to go, you can't eat here.\"

\"Okay, can we sit down?\"

\"No, food stops at 8:30.\"

\"It says you close at 9.\"

\"No you can't eat here.\"

On top of this brash exchange, the man was incredibly standoffish, rude and almost angry in how he spoke. We were excited to try this place out, to the point of spending money to get here, but this piss poor customer service means we're never coming back.

{"text":"BF and I had dinner here last night after a performance at the Mesa Arts Center. Not very crowded. We were served quickly. I ordered the green curry and made it clear: NO MUSHROOMS. The waiter repeated \"no mushrooms\". BF had the Masaman curry. You guessed it. Out came the food and mine had MUSHROOMS!!!! Waiter took it away, but left BF's entree. He was almost done by the time they brought mine out. Having said this, the food itself was excellent. It was an uncomfortable situation....."}
{"text":"One of the best places to go for food in downtown Mesa. The food is fantastic! Lunch special comes complete with a light tasty cup of soup and a crispy spring roll along with your lunch-size entree. My favorites to order are the cashew chicken and yellow curry with fried tofu. There are also many vegetarian friendly options offered up here. 

With dishes named Evil Jungle Princess and a great lunch special, what's not to love? Oh, right! The serve. When it is close to the 3:00PM midday closing time do not expect much. The hostess/server has already checkout of working about an hour ago and is the newly appointed mayor of cranky town. 

On this last visit we arrived just a little after 2PM, thinking it would be plenty of time to grab a cup of soup and some tea. When approached to be sat at a table, we were asked if we \"ate fast\"? Um, what?! Do you serve food fast? Not really based on previous visits but you don't see me questioning you about it.

It gets worse. They were out of soup. And that happens but they didn't even check with us if we wanted something else. Instead, they just brought out to us some spring rolls. Um, what is going on here?! We were hungry so we ate them but this could easily have been a huge issue. 

While this was all happening, we saw a man who arrived at 2:29PM be turned away. It was applauding how unbelievably rude they were to him. Holy hell! Maybe it was an off day, but it is not cool to treat paying guests like that at all. Given that downtown Mesa is not the busiest of places, you'd think a restaurant would welcome the opportunity to serve as many guests as possible. 

This experience has certainly made me change my mind about where I want to get Thai food in the future. It is a real shame that the amazing food here can not be matched in attitude by the employees."}
{"text":"Wow this is my new favorite Thai restaurant.

I ordered the Mixed Vegetables and added cashews and it was delicious. They charged extra for the nuts, but I guess that makes sense.

The restaurant is elegant with cloth napkins.

In May 2015, lunch prices are eight dollars.  This includes an eggroll and soup.

The service is great.

They serve coke products.

On Wednesday at lunch, the restaurant only had one entry table. This tells me it's popular."}

The food is healthy and delicious, and a good value
The Service is very fast though it is strictly business

{"text":"I was originally walking to Queen's Pizzeria on Main Street to order a vegan pizza, but after passing by this restaurant Thai food was calling to me! I came in here only expecting to glance over the menu and ended up dining in. This is the first time I have ever eaten Thai food and it was a fantastic experience.

As a vegan, it can be difficult to find restaurants with a lot of vegan options. But this restaurant has numerous vegan options and I found them to be very accommodating to my lifestyle. They answered any questions I had about what was in the food. I ordered the spring roll appetizer and the Pad Lard Na with tofu.

With every order, they give you a complimentary cup of soup and an egg roll/spring roll. The soup was steaming hot and tasty and the spring roll was also good. They also provide sweet chili sauce to dip the spring roll in.

I actually preferred the complimentary spring roll to my spring roll appetizer. If I had known you got a spring roll for free, I probably wouldn't have ordered the appetizer. The presentation of the spring rolls was beautiful and the sauce they came with was great. The spring rolls taste a lot better dipped in the sauce, so don't forgo it if you get them!

The Pad Lard Na comes with sauteed flat rice noodles with sweet soy sauce, broccoli, Chinese broccoli, baby corn, and mushroom soy bean sauce. My only  two complaints about the dish are that I was expecting it to be firm tofu instead of soft tofu, and that there was a bit too much sauce. Other than that it was everything I had hoped for! The vegetables were cooked perfectly, the sauce was sweet like I expected, and it was a very large portion! Definitely worth $10.

The only mistake the server made was giving me a diet coke instead of a sprite but quickly remedied it by giving me what I had ordered. I found the service to be excellent and gave them a tip over 25%

If you're ever in the mood for Thai food, try this place out! I know I will be returning."}
{"text":"Pad Thai, Green and Yellow Curry were all excellent. We asked for dumplings and our server shared that \"they are only for kids\". High quality flavors and ingredients. Plenty of meat and veggies in each dish."}
{"text":"I cannot believe how amazing the food is at this place. I am a frequenter of Thai restaurants, and I have not had food this authentic. It tastes like everything is made from scratch. The massamun, pad thai, and tom ka were fantastic. I am impressed. Service was excellent as well. This is now my #1 Thai place."}
{"text":"Thai food that delivers? Yes, please! Granted, it's not as good as Thai Spices, but it's still very passable. 

It was one of those nights where there's no food in the house, and you're already in your comfy clothes, and you don't feel like getting dressed again to go out. So I needed to find something that delivered. I turned to my trusty Yelpers to see what was recommended. This place came up. It was Thai, it had a good rating and it delivered. Ok, let's give it a shot. 

I ordered chicken and oyster sauce and pork Thai fried rice. 

The good: When the guy told me it would be here in 10-15 minutes, I chuckled, but it really was delivered within 15 minutes! A major plus, compared to the 45-50 minutes one usually gets quoted for delivery times. The food was good. Not great, but good. The portions were a good size, especially the fried rice. 

The Not So Good: The chicken and oyster sauce could have had more flavour. This was one of my staples when I was living in Bangkok, so I know what it COULD taste like. It was pretty much just chicken and broccoli, and I was hoping for a little more. The $20 minimum for delivery, plus a $2 delivery charge is a little much. It basically forces you to order at least two entrees, even if you're just ordering for one person. 
The menu items are a little pricey. We're talking $10 for fried rice, $9 for my chicken and oyster sauce. I don't mind paying if the food is worth it, but I'm still going with Thai Spices as the best Thai in town. 

But, if you've got a hankering for Thai food and don't want to go out, then I'd totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was excellent and we will definitely return for another dinner in the near future. The staff were great and service was very good."}
{"text":"This isn't the best Thai food I've had but overall it's always impressive and good.  love their masaman curry.  Their green curry is also delicious.  The restaurant itself is clean and well kept."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a couple birthdays...  

We all ordered and shared our dishes... we had  

*Pad Thai (very flavorful, thin noodles, nicely sauced, fresh veggies YUM!)
*Masaman curry with chicken (delicious slightly sweet/tangy (tamarindo) sauce with potatoes and chicken, garnished with peanuts)  This was different but equally as delish as the others.
*Spicy Basil (Pad Gra-Prow) This was suprisingly a table favorite.  Flavorful and savory and the green beans were SO perfectly cooked.  I would order this again for sure.
*Choo-Chee Seafood Curry - Shrimp, scallops, fish and squid in coconut milk and Choo-Chee curry paste top with lime leaves.  Perfectly cooked seafood, spicy sauce, great!
* Red Curry - Thai red curry simmered with coconut milk with shrimp & zucchini, bamboo shoots, green bean, eggplant and basil leaves.  This was my sons pick... So tasty and perfectly spicy!  
*Lemon Grass Soup - mushrooms and onions with chicken (or was is pork?)... a little too heavy on the fish sauce for my taste but still pretty good.
*Fried Spring Rolls - crispy and tasty served with a chili sauce
*Chicken Sa-Te - served with curry peanut sauce (YUM!) and cucumber salad (tangy and fresh/crisp)

I'll be back here FOR SURE!  The prices are VERY reasonable and the food is fresh and flavorful.

Only gripe was the hovering bus boy.  Holy crap, can we eat and talk in peace???  No?"}
{"text":"We returned to Nunthaporn's last week before a show at the Mesa Center for the Arts. The food was amazing, as always, but I am happy to report that the service was also excellent. We were greeted and seated swiftly and the restaurant was almost full. Our server was attentive and professional although he was  quite busy. 

Along with Nunthaporn's excellent service, they serve some of the most delicious Thai food in the East Valley and their menu includes an entire page of vegan options that include traditional dishes. My husband had the vegan Pad Thai and enjoyed it. I had regular Pad Thai with tofu and it was delicious.  We will definitely return to Nunthaporn's soon."}
{"text":"Not busy at all for St Patrick's Day ;)  Second time having Thai food within the week and this was by far the better of the two.  The only slight disappointment was the appetizer, Miang Kum.  When a dish states prawns as the second ingredient, I guess I expect a plump juicy prawn, not diced little bits of it.  Ah well, chock that up to unfamiliarity - will order Chicken Sa-Te next time!  The entrees we ordered, Pad Thai Shrimp and Pra Rham Chicken were excellent, the chili lime sauce on the latter was spicy and flavorful."}
{"text":"Holy crap. I wasn't ready for that much spice. I  ordered the green curry which is one of my favorite Thai dishes. Most of the Thai restaurants I've been to ask what number you would like, 1 being mild and the higher the number the hotter the dish. I would highly recommend this for this establishment. I did not really enjoy my food because it was too spicy, and I like some spice. Service was good. Cute little place."}
{"text":"One of the BEST Thai food restaurants in the valley! Any of the basil dishes are flavorful! Can't wait until the Fresh rolls are back on the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The chicken fried rice is the best thing on the menu but of course their yellow curry is pretty good too! They didn't get a full five stars as when my coworkers and I dined in it took forever to get our food when we were the only ones there and we had come at opening. As well as their wait staff we have come in contact with have not been the friendliest. Definitely worth going for the food!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I am a little bit of a Thai fanatic. I work close to Nunthaporn's so uasually when I eat Thai, Nunthaporn's is where I go. I went somewhere else close to my house the other night and I about spit it out, \"THIS is not Nunthaporn's!\" 

I am used to such a high quality, delicious, flavorful dish from eating at Nunthporn's and other places just don't even come close. Now I thought... maybe it was just that one place... and then I made the mistake again with another that delivered to my house. It wasn't even comparable. 

If you want the BEST Thai you have ever had, go to Nunthaporn's. Don't make the same mistake I did."}
{"text":"I am fron Oregon and we have some really good Thai restaurants and love Thai food so to find a good Thai food place here in Arizona is great.  Thanks yelpers!
My only complaint was the mushy tofu, even though i asked for crispy, it was so mushy i just could not eat it.
Other then that i loved the pad thai, and yellow curry (mushy tofu) and chicken satay for everyone.
My son (his first time eating Thai) had the Pad woon-sen #407 and he loved it.
Husband (also first time eating Thai) had the Evil jungle #411 and didn't like it but he like the Garlic lovers #401.   I will be back!
Almost forgot, outstaning customer service. Never wanted for nothing and they where very nice.  They greated us as soon as we walked in and several said goodnight as we left."}
{"text":"Not as good as Touch of Thai (which sets the bar for Thai food in Phoenix), but a very nice place with fantastic service and good fresh food. They are flexible, the prices are affordable, and the options are plenty. $10 for a nice lunch combo. Parking is a little tricky, but you can find it."}
{"text":"Service- it seemed as if the servers were overwhelmed even if the dinning room was not full. Forgetful.
Food- it was ok. Not bad not great.
Price- less than $10 for lunch and drink. If chicken, pork, tofu, or vegetables.
Ambience- casual dinning, brown vinyl booths and tables, white walls.
Location- parking is a little tricky. You park in back or near public lot and then walk to establishment."}
{"text":"Great lunch deal. Great staff. Food a bit Americanized but staff helpful bringing dish of fish sauce & Thai chilis to spice things up. And they take Downtown Mesa Dollars coupons!"}
{"text":"Had lunch a few days ago with a friend and we both said it was beyond doubt the best Thai food we have ever had and we visit a lot of Thai restaurants, plus we are both senior enough to have enjoyed dozens of Thai restaurants in our days... this was my 3rd visit here... the service on this day was beyond excellent... the server tended to us frequently and also gave us a little chef's lesson on the flavorings of Thai food... it was quite fascinating. On one of the previous occasions the service was slow... on that occasion, it was a very busy time of day, so understandable. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars, rounded down for some service issues. Nice location with a patio looking out on Main St, good, fresh food, acceptable service.

I came here on a friend's suggestion and enjoyed my meal. I had the jungle curry; when I ordered it, I was cautioned by the server that it was \"really spicy\" and water-based, rather than coconut milk-based. I appreciated the warning, but went with it anyway. It did in fact turn out to be pretty spicy, but being the pepper belly that I am, I was fine with it. But for somebody who doesn't appreciate spiciness as much as I do, this warning would be really important, because the dish would be inedible to such a person. After that warning, though, the service got rather screwy (though still friendly). When our 3 dishes came out, they weren't really our 3 dishes. Mine was right, but the other 2 were not. After being notified of this, the server took back 1 dish and came back with another...which also wasn't correct. Finally, the third time was a charm, and my sister got her dish. Not a horrible experience, but it took off a half star from my rating.

So, the food. We started with the Thai Toast, which is a nice little deep-fried creation. This isn't typically my type of food, but I really like the onion and cucumber sauce we put on top of it. My jungle curry was pretty solid, with a lot of veggies, which I always appreciate. I really enjoyed my sister's pad thai (once she got it, that is); it had a different taste from most pad thais I've had in the past, and I really enjoyed the uniqueness. Good, solid Thai food--not the best I've had, but good stuff.

The service could be improved, but this is a good option when in Downtown Mesa."}
{"text":"This place is in a really cool location in downtown Mesa.  It is in what you can tell is a very old building, probably historic.  The food is pretty good, I have never had a bad dish.  The service can sometimes be lackluster, they seem to always be understaffed.  The waitstaff is generally very friendly and helpful but very busy as well."}
{"text":"Service was slow. My waiter was friendly but not very efficient. I ordered prawns and eggplant. 
The prawns were good. The spices were right. The eggplant was undercooked and I had to leave most of it on my plate.
When I told the waiter it was undercooked, he parroted it - undercooked?
Yes, I replied.
All he said was OK.

I did not know how to react after that, so I paid and left."}
{"text":"In finding myself  at loose ends for nearly a week, I took a trip to Mesa on the suggestion of someone who could previously be trusted for restaurant suggestions (As you say, I cannot tell a lie, Kris...).

Arriving at the restaurant  at 2:20 PM, there were 3 occupied tables that I could see.  One was ordering as I arrived, another was receiving their meal, and the third was well into their entrees.  At the waitstand, I picked up a paper version of their menu.  It is interesting how many restaurants change their prices in the 'table' version of the menu, but they ignore the change in their take away version.  These folks passed the price comparison.

I was greeted by a friendly waitperson.  She brought me to my table, asked about my beverage preference and asked where I would like to sit.  I was seated at a 2-top (though the bench on 1 side apparently means something else in Restauranteeze) and placed my order, Som Tom, no green beans, no shrimp, and Thai hot along with a side of steamed rice.  Because I proceeded out of sequence, my waitperson was not ready; she got her pad and quietly let me know that this was her first day.  She asked me to repeat my order.  I did, and she thanked me for my patience.  Off she went, bearing my order to the kitchen.  She returned in a minute with water.

As I looked around, I counted table and seating space I could see.  18 tables, being for 2 or 4, benches and chairs for about 60 people.  Next time, I will take more time and see if there are other tables.  The plastic carafes full of water...no.  Most looked to be as full as they were when they were placed on the tables at opening.  As I waited for my order, I drained the glass and filled it from the carafe.  If there is any suggestion I would give, please put glass, ceramic or metal carafes out.

Salad and rice arrived.  Nicely sized portions of each, about 1 1/2 cups of rice and 2 cups of salad.  On getting my first forkful of salad, I knew it needed more chile.  When I caught Waitperson's eye, she came over and I asked for more chile.  She said she would get more, turned to go and turned back, asking if I wanted fresh or dried.  This question was the saving grace, preventing a 1-star review.

Waitperson brought out chopped fresh thai chili.  I incorporated this into the salad.  What started as a 2 was now a 6 in heat.  While the papaya seemed fresh, there were lots of bits of green beans.  To me, the better filler is carrot.  The texture is crunchier and the flavor is enhanced.  Probably the biggest challenge was the dressing.  The best Som Tom recipes show hints of garlic, lime, chili, palm sugar and fish sauce.  This version had fish sauce, sugar, chili and bottled lime juice.  It lacked the sparkle that should have gone along with the crunch.  Unfortunately, doctoring Som Tom with chili after the preparation is a marginal adjustment.  Having the chili in with the preparation helps the flavor spread throughout the preparation.  

Being spoiled by a native who enjoyed this salad as much as I did, the preparation here does not compare.  I must try Nunthaporn's again for other items.  As of now, 2 stars is the best I can give."}
{"text":"The food is good. I've probably eaten here five times in the past month. Its priced very reasonably. The thai basil and Evil Jungle Princess are great. A few complaints I have: there's a waiter whose name I don't know, but he wears glasses and is always there-  he has awkwardly stared at me for long periods of time while I was eating. Enough that its made me uncomfortable. I don't really like getting stared at while eating. Also, they have a dish called \"Garlic Lover\" that should be renamed \"Black Pepper Lover\". Both times I ordered it, there was visibly too much black pepper and I could feel it crunching in my teeth as I ate my food. It really ruins what would otherwise be a good dish. But other than that, the place is fine. I'll keep coming here."}
{"text":"Well, it hurts me to write this, but I feel I have to do it. Without a doubt, this is our favorite place for Thai food. We love our \" USUAL \" server, Irving ( sorry if I spelled it incorrectly! ). But the other day we came in for lunch and ordered our GO TO dish Pad Thai. Well, the LITTLE FELLOW, who apparently is a family member of the owners had some difficulty understanding what I had requested, and as I tried to explain to him what I wanted, our regular server came by, and I mentioned to him that \" you know what we normally get. \"This LITTLE FELLOW flipped out and was damn near yelling at me about how he was part of the family, and he knows the food better then our regular guy. I was shocked as was the company I was with.
I am now in a puzzled state as to whether or not I want to return to this place. Perhaps as long as I do not have this individual wait on us, I 'll be content. Otherwise, I will not eat there when he is working.
Again, this hurts me deeply to say and write this. We love our little THIA restaurant."}
{"text":"Had lunch at noon on a Saturday. Not too busy. Very good service. Clean. All 4 of us had different entrees and all were very good. Will return to try something different."}
{"text":"Went to this little place on Main Street in Mesa after a matinee performance at the MAC with a group of friends. Great pad thai with shrimp (lots of shrimp!) I was a little frustrated that they didn't offer two of the iced tea choices that were printed in their menu (server explanation: We don't serve that anymore.) I finally ordered a regular iced tea NO LEMON, and of course what did it come with.......lemon!  It was an off time for dinner (around 5 PM) but the place was pretty full and the service (as has been mentioned here) was SLOW. Also, interestingly enough, our table of 6 (and we ordered all together) was served at three different times. First two orders came out, about 5 minutes later 3 more, and about 5 minutes after that the last one. ??? 
The food is good and I would probably go back, but I will know next time about the service!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Nunthaporn for years. It is my \"go-to\" for Thai food. I've never had a bad dish and it's because Nunthaporn(pronounced nun-tha-pon), the owner prepares the food herself, fresh every time. 

Prepare to wait for fresh food, so bring good friends, but it's worth it...believe me! I read a couple reviews complaining about this, but if you want frozen garbage nuked in the back, hit McDonald's or something.

My absolute favorite is a coconut-based dish called evil jungle princess. I hold the mushrooms because I just don't like mushrooms, but that's okay because everything is made to order the way you want it. Sometimes, I kick the heat up to a 3, but I personally don't go higher so I can still taste the delicious flavor in everything. 

To top off your meal, I recommend the coconut gelato. It's flavored with real coconut, not just a flavoring, so you get little bits of coconut in every bite. Great place to have a nice sit down with family, friends, or a business meeting."}
{"text":"PRE SHOW FLOP

Reservations made days in advance, and then confirmed by text message, yet extremely vague as the date wasn't included.

When we arrived we entered an very crowded lobby/ front desk area. Not only was it crowded but nobody was happy. There was a large group that wanted the big empty table in the middle that was being held for a reservation. This group did not make a reservation but had been looking at that table empty for almost 30 minutes and had agreed to split up.

When we finally spoke with the host/server/ owner/manager? (older gentleman) he did not have our reservation and the text they sent us without the date was insufficient to get our reserved table. He was short, curt and rude. He was stressed out and completely overwhelmed.

With show time in an hour and lack of options on Main st we waited for a resolution. Finally sat our service was off and rushed. It was also rude and uncomfortable. It appeared the entire place was in meltdown.

Now that service is out of the way lets talk food. IT WAS TERRIBLE!!!!!
I expected even just a little more but of the 4 dishes including  Tom ka Ga (sp) Soup, Black Pepper shrimp, a Curry, and Pad Thai it was all HORRIBLE and just barely edible. Beers arrive on the warm side, maybe 55 or 60 degrees and the sake was soured. We payed and left as we had already seen that host //// lash out at us and others. I was not even going to bother complaining. They had to know what a shit show they were producing that night."}
{"text":"We came here with friends who have eaten here often. We ate on a Friday night around 7:30. There wasn't a long wait to be seated. 
The service wasn't bad. But we had heard about the service being hit or miss. I guess our table didn't need much attention anyways. It helps that they have water jugs on the table. Once you're seated you're only attended to for ordering and clearing dishes. 

The food was so good!! We tried Chicken Pad Thai at spicy level 3 and pork Thai fried rice. My husband and I shared and felt full! Good portions. 

We would definitely recommend coming here again."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Thai restaurants in AZ and there are few as good as this place.  The pad thai is awesome with shrimp here, the seafood's fresh and delicious.  They also have some items you can't find at your average Thai restaurant here,  the mincemeat dishes like larb in particular is great.  Try ordering something unusual from this place, I haven't had anything short of delicious here."}
{"text":"I have been spoiled with some great Thai food, and this place is... adequate. My wife got the massaman curry and I decided to try something new with the jungle curry. They were both good, but not absolutely amazing. The massaman was a bit too sweet for me, and the jungle curry was nothing to write home about. The server was not terribly attentive. So overall it was a good experience, but we will likely not return."}
{"text":"Walked in with a party of 6. Two customers in the restaurant. One waitress looks at us and then looks away. Her coworker unenthusiastically asks \"how many\". As I walk towards the restroom she says \"excuse me we're going to need you to wait in the front\". That attitude was all I needed to hear, so we turned around and left. Go down the street to Thai Spice, which is 2 miles away, and way better in terms of service and ambiance and the food is great too."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. Came in here not knowing the area very well and came across this place. It was very clean and the staff, although very busy, were friendly. 

We ordered the Tom Yum soup with chicken. It was a lighter colored broth, so I was afraid it wouldn't have much flavor. I was totally wrong! It was very delicious and I would go back there just to get more.

I also ordered a spicy chicken dish with baby corns, lime basil, green beans and bamboo shoots which was also very tasty. It did have slivers of ginger through out, but if your not a fan, they are easy to avoid. 

The only reason I give them 3 stars (really it's a 3 &1/2 star) was because it was a busy night and service was just a little slow. (But, they were hustling and moving quickly to keep up.)

I look forward to returning to try the sticky rice for dessert. All on all, this place is worth a 1st try and maybe a return."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town. Amazing lunch prices. Be sure to try the Thai iced tea and the cashew chicken."}
{"text":"Sean our server was great! Super fast service! We ordered the Panang Curry Chicken and it was good. I ordered the Thai Fried Rice (with chicken) and loved it. This is only our second time but I would recommend it. Small but good. Parking in the back of the restaurant. Great everything!"}
{"text":"Four star flavor!  My palette was pleased. Came on a Wed, near 5pm. Service was good, food was great. Started off with Thai Tea served in a long tall glass, very good, then ordered Pad Thai, excellent taste and large portion for 10 bucks."}
{"text":"It was our first time at the restaurant and the waitress suggested some very good food. The curries are good and we especially liked the crab rolls. It is a great place for a quick meal."}
{"text":"We planned ahead to have dinner here and made reservations the for 6:15 PM before going to the 7:30 PM showing of Dreamgirls at the MAC. 
Arrived around 6:20 and was seated immediately. The place was crowded and the service seemed to be a bit slow. We all ready knew what we wanted so we ordered our meal at 6:30 PM. 

My wife and I sat and conversed over hot Jasmine tea. Some time had past and the server came to our table and told us that it would be another 10 minutes before our order would be ready and do we want to wait. I looked at the time and it was 7:10. I told him 'NO, void our ticket. So, we got up and left for the theatre. 

If they were on Top Chef, I would have told them to 'pack your knives and LEAVE'.
The food is excellent there, but if you can't produce in a timely manner, then WHY even open.

I think their problem is that they possible have one chef and when the restaurant is crowded, there is NO WAY they can keep the patrons HAPPY.
There was a another table with two ladies and they were able to eat just the appetizer.

I hope the owners of the restaurant are reading these comments from YELP because they have to open their eyes to see they are above the heads and NEED to hire another CHEF in the kitchen.

If there was an option of ZERO stars, that's what I would have rated them."}
{"text":"This has quickly become our favorite thai place. We also frequent the Wild Thai Tiger in phoenix, but it is a bit of a drive and pricey.

We discovered this place on a Cruisin on Main St car event, and everytime we have eaten there we are happy.

The prices are more than fair, the staff is always great (we always have the same waitress it seems.

The Crispy spring rolls are the best, and I always have the Trout, which is really good, or my favorite there, the Cashew Chicken. It is never too spicy, and the portion size is Great.
My Fiance is a vegetarian and loves the different curries with tofu. We have never had a bad experience here, out of about 35 times."}
{"text":"I just had lunch here and it was AMAZING. I love this place. I had the Pad Thai and my brother in law had the cashew chicken. This place is fresh tasting, fulfilling, and pretty inexpensive. I would recommend this place to anyone. Actually, we are eating there again tomorrow. Very clean too which is important."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Don't let the stupid white people who had to wait 2 minutes for a refill steer you from here. The waiter we had was the man, food was so good and it was real quick."}
{"text":"Nunthaporn's is a great place for a date night. Located in downtown Mesa right off the main strip. The restaurant is along the art walk and surrounded by beautiful scenery. Service is very fast and the food is pretty good. My husband and I ordered my favorite dish pad woon sen. portions were not big enough to share but tasty. We also ordered the Thai tea; it was a pretty small size. Food was good but not great, serving portions were small, and the service is okay but I still recommend it for a fun night out."}
{"text":"Got the green curry tofu lunch special ($8) to go. The lunch includes 2 small spring rolls, your choice of brown or white rice, and if you eat-in soup is included too. It was well packaged and ready in about 10 minutes. 

The curry was a medium level of spiciness to me and had a lot of vegetables and soft tofu. The sauce was nicely seasoned and I had a plentiful amount of rice to eat it with. The spring rolls were lightly crispy and a good complement to the curry. The curry was a bit watery though.

The interior is well decorated with light wood accents. I'll have to eat in one of these days to enjoy the ambiance! Overall it was a good meal and I'd go back to try more off the menu.

3.5/5"}
{"text":"This is a superb place to dine.  Curries or pineapple fried rice tend to be my faves.  The service is excellent and each table has a carafe of water sitting on it, a nice touch as we move into the hot summer.  I highly recommend it for a place to take a date."}
{"text":"Best Thai food around! We've tried quite a few Thai places and this seems the most authentic. Love the sweet and sour chicken, Thai fried chicken rice and som tom. Eat here all the time and have never had a bad experience!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but the service is HORRIBLE.  We came about 8:15, they close, and I mean CLOSE at 9.  You better have your food in a bag by then or they will throw you and your plate out the door.  They rushed us to order, practically stood by the table while we ate, nearly took the food out from under us.  Sorry, I am desperate for ethnic food here but won't go back."}
{"text":"I decided to try this restaurant because I have become familiar with it in the past. I got my table and needed to use the restroom. I had to wait for the use of the restroom and all of a sudden a person darted out that look like a waiter. I noticed when I went to wash my hands that the sink was dry. That's sparked in my mind the possibility that the waiter had not been cleanly after using the restroom. I couldn't get the thought out of my mind all during the meal. He also subsequently served me my meal which was even a more frustrating. I wasn't sure how to handle that situation so I just ate my meal and basically chalked up that I wouldn't be visiting the restaurant again. On a scale of other Thai food restaurants I'm only giving them two stars because I felt that their food was not as outstanding as some of the other restaurants that I have visited. Certainly restaurants like Thai Chili 2 Go and Thai Basil have it going on and they are really good restaurants to visit, and I would recommend looking into them. I think the history of this restaurant and some of the awards that they have one in the past, but management needs to take a close look at making sure health standards are kept at the forefront of their operations. I'm not trying to downgrade this restaurant, but I feel that maybe there are some things that need to be looked into."}
{"text":"had the evil jungle princess, it was freaking awesome. hubbie had something with beef and green beans, awesome too, but could not steal my heart from the jungle princess. I will eat here many times again. prices are good, nice relaxed atmosphere. slower paced than some restaurants but don't go there starving; enter, relax, order and eat whats your hurry?"}

The Red Curry was ordered Spicy but it wasn't sooo spicy it was kind of hard to eat.  The yellow curry was terrible.  4 sad shrimp 6 hard potatoes and the broth seemed diluted with water thin and runny.  The potatoes were hard just like the 1st time . And the thai teas were barely filled . I will not be back"}
{"text":"I come from Southern California, the land of the million Thai food places, and I'm a big fan of Thai, so I've had Thai food at a lot of different places. So when a few years ago I went to a convention whose main event was at 12 W Main, across the street from a Thai place in Mesa, I had to try it out. And I'm glad I did - I've been coming back once a year for that convention, and make sure to visit this place every year when I do!

This place is *slightly* more expensive than the average around there, but the food is just as good as places in LB (better than some!) I *always* get noodle dishes, but with a name like \"Evil Jungle Princess\" (and a description including several of my favorite things), I couldn't help but try it. I made the right choice - I can't help but order the same thing every time (I can get pad thai and pad see ew anywhere, I haven't found any other place with the same recipe for this one.) I've tried bites of a few other things, though, and they've been pretty good too. 

Hilariously, this year when I was back a couple weeks ago, we (this convention) basically ate all their food - by the time I got there, they were out of several things. They handled it well, though."}
{"text":"Omg this place is awesome.  Atmosphere is airy,  clean and inviting.  Green curry and Pana ng both amazing.  First time here and def won't be my last."}
{"text":"Oh Nunthaporn's, why you so good?  Love this place.  My friends and I go all the time for lunch on Saturday.  They have a great lunch special menu.  I always get the Pad Thai and my friends get the Cashew Chicken.  For $7.50 you get a bowl of soup, some wontons, and a spring roll to start.  Then you pick your entree.  The soup is a simple broth with some veggies.  Light and easy.  The spring rolls are so good.  Fried to perfection.  The Pad Thai is the best I've ever had.  The rice noodles are tossed in a delicious peanut sauce.  Mixed with onion, bean sprouts, tofu, and your choice of meat (I always get the chicken).  They always give you a huge portion which is great.  You can take almost half of it home with you.
This is just a nice place for lunch or dinner.  It's clean, the service is great and fast, and it's right off Main Street.  Also, they have a lunch punch card.  Once you get 10 lunches, you get a free one!  Pretty cool."}
{"text":"A very solid choice for good Thai food. They are good about meeting orders and are nice."}
{"text":"In the last month, I have eaten at this restaurant twice.  

The first time was in early February on a Monday evening when I was doing a photo shoot.  We stopped here to go to the bathroom that I came back afterwards to eat dinner with my son.   Initially, the service was very slow....we waited forever to get a menu, drink, or to give our order...but it was ok since my son & I were just chatting and reviewing pictures anyways.   When the food arrived it was delicious!  For the first time I tried a curry without coconut milk, the Jungle Curry and LOVED it and want to learn how to make it!   My son (age 7) also loved his food.  He said it was the best Thai food he ever had.  And on top of it all, our sever told me all about fresh peppercorns  - which were in my curry - I love learning new things about food! 

I visited again a few weeks later when I was in the area for a class at the Mesa Arts Center.   I was with a grou, and tried the Penang Curry Lunch Special.  It was very good.   And the service was fantastic!

I do plan to visit again in the future."}
{"text":"It's good and pretty flavorful, although I've tried four different entrees now and they all are on the sweet, rather than spicy, side.  Maybe next time I will specify that I want some kick to it.  The lunch special is a great deal for $7.50. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was really good; service was slow. 

They were definitely WAY UNDERSTAFFED. Those poor guys were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Frenzied. Far too many customers for just a couple of servers to keep up with . . . even good ones. 

Customers were waiting in front when there were empty tables. 

Recommendation: Could have solved some of the problems by having a \"hostess\" during busy times . . . someone to clear tables, seat customers and take checks. Then the servers could concentrate on what they do best . . . serve, and make sure customers are happy, so they will return. Just makes good business sense to me. 

Good food is not always enough. Only go when you have plenty of time to spare."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Thai food in Mesa. The pad Thai, a traditional favorite, it is especially good here. But be careful on the spiciness, because ordering anything above a \"5\" might burn your mouth!  The staff is attentive and very professional, and quick. I was here with a group of about 39 people, and they were spot on. Everybody in the group ate at pretty much the same time, which is pretty miraculous for that number of people in a relatively modest size restaurant.  I highly recommend this place and definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food at great prices. This is a favorite lunchtime spot of mine. I'm never disappointed by the quality and flavors."}
{"text":"Love the pad Thai with chicken here, I always go with a 2 on 1-5 spicy scale. I have not tried something on the menu I didn't love. They have a diverse menu and the service and food is authentic."}
{"text":"Springs rolls are awesome. Curry delicious. And service was outstanding,"}
{"text":"Off the hook good! Definitely the real deal. Not just fresh and plentiful, but steaming hot and priced more than fair.EAT HERE... it's that good."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible. I had the sweet and sour chicken. My new favorite place. They are busy. Came down in a Saturday night around 7pm. Busy. The cashew chicken was also good."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Thai restaurant! We are huge fans of ALL of their curries and ALL of their noodle dishes. It is so difficult for me to order from this restaurant because I hate choosing only one dish. It would be an amazing (but weird) development if they turned into a Thai Tapas restaurant so I could order tiny portions of 15 different dishes LOL. They have 4 stars because on busy nights, the service can be quite slow. We usually order for pick up as a result. If this is your first time at a Thai restaurant, I would recommend the Pad Thai, the Yellow Curry, and the Sticky Rice with Mango. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My group went for lunch on a Friday. We were seated immediately, as it wasn't busy at all but it took 20 minutes before our server even acknowledged that we were there. When she did finally take our order, she didn't bring out our drinks right away. We actually had to bring it up twice with her, and we got our food before we got anything to drink. It was ridiculous especially with some of us ordering spicy curry. She wasn't apologetic at all and just seemed to not care about the customers, overall not professional.
The food was great though! I had the Evil Jungle Princess and the mango rice for dessert. I'd give it 4/5, but I've never had such terrible service before coming here. We were all disappointed because the reviews are great. Next time we'll just order to go."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service.
Loved the appetizers and shared several main dishes family-style.  Try a few dishes and take the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  

We have been there with friends several times and have never been disappointed.  Go a little early or late for lunch or dinner for immediate seating."}
{"text":"Extremely solid drunken noodle. At first bite, I almost gave this place a five-star. The noodles were cooked with a very hot wok to give it that heated flavour, but nothing was burnt. It was very sweet and white peppery and basily and garlicky. It wasn't wet and drenched with sauce either,and the noodle was cooked del dente. I hate it when I order drunken noodle and it's filled with large red and green peppers, but this dish had no peppers - bamboo shoots, carrots, green beans, and this type of dry corn i dont know the name of. So Good! I had to take away the fifth star as i ploughed on through my noodle though, as the pork and vegetables were not flavourful at all. I ended up picking out the noodle only and left the rest (I wasn't hungry anyway). I wish i can find drunken noodle like this everywhere i go.

After tax, the noodle was less than $10 and i was pretty happily full. There were people coming in steadily throughout the night. The service can probably get a little spotty since there were only two people manning the floor and the dude waiter seemed young and very new to the job. He kept asking people if they wanted a table or booth even though the booth was full - kinda funny when you're sitting directly facing the front."}
{"text":"We spent a month in Thailand, so I feel like I'm allowed to say this is some of the most authentic Thai food I've had! The food is so so yummy and the service is exceptional! I love the crispy spring rolls, massaman curry, and the Thai Basil Chicken!"}
{"text":"We went hoping to have a good experience - the place was noisy, there was at least one empty table, and there seemed to be sufficient staff -  yet we stood waiting for acknowledgement from the hostess for over 5-10 minutes.  After having her come up to the front and still not acknowledge us several times, we decided they clearly didn't want our business and left.  How this place received a Best of Phoenix vote is beyond me, given that they seem to have no care at all in acknowledging their customers."}
{"text":"it's good. got the pad thai lunch special. i never get anything else in thai restaurants.

But it wasnt as tasty as the other pad thai's ive had before. I loved Palee's Crown but apparently they closed.

I guess they use a little less sweet sauce, and more diced tofu than I would have liked since my choice of meat to add in was Fried Tofu. Tofu overload.

but honestly it was edible, and wasnt horrible. 

Nice place, ambiance and all. I wish I had time to eat in and have their soup of the day that comes with the lunch special."}
{"text":"I've had the best of Thai there and the curries are to die for...the service can be inconsistent, but the food is always top notch, so it's worth it to be a little patient. The owner is a gem and really cares about her customers."}
{"text":"This is my second time here, I tried the 'Pad Thai' this time and it was a little salty but still pretty good. They serve a small soup and egg roll as a complimentary appetizer, which the egg roll tastes awesome and I really wish they gave you two. After the meal is done Im always pretty stuffed. Plan at least a 45 min meal time when going with a few people."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  The Pad Thai was perfect!  If you are planning to eat here before a show at the Mesa Arts Center then make sure you get a reservation because this place gets packed!"}
{"text":"Loved this place.  The green curry was awesome!"}
{"text":"the food is decent--not memorable or special, but acceptable.

The service, however, is appalling. It's been a while since I've had such bad service. The staff who greeted us were pretty surly, as if they resented our coming into the restaurant--which should have been a signal to leave. That, and the fact that there were fewer patrons there than at any other restaurant on Main Street.

A couple of menus were slammed down on the table in front of us. Our order was pretty simple--two pad thai, one without chives--but the kitchen still managed to get it wrong. I had to ask three times for water, and no one came to check on us until long after we were done. And throughout all of it, the staff was just pissy and ill-tempered.

As we left, my lunch partner commented on how empty the place was. I said, \"Yeah, it's not surprising, given how terrible the service is\" just as the waitress walked by.

She made a point of smiling and saying brightly, \"Thanks for coming in!\" But it was too little too late.  

You have to wonder how places like Nunthaporn's stay in business.  I admit I'm still fairly new to Mesa, but there has to be better Thai food somewhere in town. If you really want good food on Main Street, try Mango's Mexican restaurant just down the street."}
{"text":"The food is okay,  not the best I've had,  but not the worst either.  
Now on the service. .. I swear I left 5 years older it was so slow.  It's a good thing that we get our own water jar at the table because I swear we didn't have a waiter.  Only go here if you're prepared to wait a while"}
{"text":"I love Thai and here i had some of the best in Mesa! i'm not a fan of places where Thai means 'super hot, have-no-idea-what-food-this-is-hot'; i'm actually a wimpy coconut yellow curry type: but the 3 of us agreed it was the best Thai we had! 

one ordered Thai hot, another 'just' hot and i the milder dish. mind you, it still had a little kick to it - but in all 3 dishes the flavors still came through. 

we had Thai ice tea (love it!) since it was lunchtime and the workday wasn't over :(

i recommend you try this gem in downtown Mesa ! let me know what you think..
since we went for a late lunch i can't comment on the noise level, (it was quiet only a few customers) but the service was great and our orders came out with perfect timing."}
{"text":"I finally went to Nunthaporn's Thai Cuisine and I was so pleased with my food. I ordered the Pad KEE-MAO and Thai Ice tea, it was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"We live in the area and eat here at least once month... Sometimes more. The food is super yummy. We always order double Pad Thai for leftovers :-).      We do take out so I don't know about service. But the people are always pleasant. 
Definitely try this place when you're near downtown Mesa."}
{"text":"Yellow curry and the shrimp fried was tasty with a lot of vegetables. Service was ok. The peach tea was very sweet so heads up to those who are diabetic. It's quaint and the restrooms were clean."}
{"text":"SOLID Thai food. Some of the best I've had outside of Chang Mai. The best part about it? It's an amazing Thai spot IN DOWNTOWN MESA. Yeah, I'm sure you've been hearing a lot of DTMesa lately... you know, the awesome comic book store, Evermore Nevermore, the new grindhouse called The Royale, Bak'd, SHIT'S BLOWING UP! So now you can go get great Thai food, shop, buy some art, some vintage clothing, and catch an ultra-gore slasher flick all in Downtown within two blocks. Amazing transformation and having a sick Thai spot just makes things sweeter.

Only complaint is it's a bit pricey, but I'm rollin' in dough so IDGaF."}
{"text":"This was my favorite Thai place in AZ aside from Pato in Flagstaff. We drove out from Tempe to eat here regularly. The food has always been great and we always ordered the green curry and pad kee mao. Today we went for lunch special. We ordered what we always do pad kee Mao and green curry. Our order came out and we received our order of curry however the other dish was wrong. We made the server aware and he took our food back, he wrote down pad see ew. Mistakes happen right? No big deal. Until the OWNER comes out and says that we made a mistake. It was our fault. I have never been treated that way at a restaurant ever. We will NEVER eat here again. I am so disappointed in the way this owner treated us as customers."}
{"text":"I did not review this place?!?! I must be losing my mind. 

Anyway, I went here probably a month and a half ago for lunch with a couple friends and it was just alright. I like how lunch came with soup and a spring roll...that was really good, but when the food came out, they had brought me the wrong thing. I would have been fine just eating what they brought (red curry....not sure how that sounded like drunken noodles, but whatever), but I generally judge a place on their drunken noodles and told the waitress. She fixed the problem, but it took a really long time for the new food to come out, so long that my friends were pretty much done when I got mine. Also, I think she forgot how spicy I had told her originally because the drunken noodles were not spicy at all. So I *might* give this place another shot, but it's not first on my list..."}
{"text":"Love Thai food and it's so close to the Mesa Arts Center - perfect before a concert, right? Summary: I would go here again for the food, but the service was very confused. 

We came early and were almost the first people there for dinner. We had 3 people stop by the table for our drink order so we were a little confused who our waiter was. We ordered an appetizer (Cheese and Shrimp rolls), and soup (Poh Tag) and a couple of entrees. The rolls came without delay and were delicious, but soup was then brought out - to the table next to us who had just ordered. Yup - it was our soup which we could see (as they ate it) included tofu. Then our entrees arrived - to the same wrong table. We all figured out that error immediately and they were switched to our table - again, delicious. But we finally caught one of the 3 waiters and said we would still like our soup. They apologized and brought soup - with vegetables and no tofu. We figure it was the soup the other table originally ordered. We sent it back and they were persuaded that they had mis-delivered the soup. Eventually our soup came (with the seafood and tofu and another apology) and we had it for dessert.

I would give a higher review if they had taken the soup off our bill after all the screw-ups, but they didn't. So figure this as 4 stars for the food and 2 for the service."}
{"text":"Always have a nice lunch or dinner here! The hours are weird sometimes I end up forgetting they close down to switch to dinner:( love the curry chicken puffs? Something like that... AMAZING. wonton soup, AMAZING. and of course the curry dishes. AMAZING.


I will say though I have came few times and the servers haven't been too rude but they are pushy! Maybe I just never have good luck with servers... But there is a really nice lady server I will have to ask for her name next time and update this review but she is always super nice and welcoming!!"}
{"text":"By my other Thai restaurant favorites, Nunthaporn's came up short meeting my expectations.  For three adults, one order of sat tay consisted of 4 stickers...  why not 6?  We shared a yellow curry dish which tasted good, and they offered one small cup of steamed rice to split three ways.  My favorite fried banana dessert is on the menu, but wasn't available.  Small serving sizes seems to be a custom here."}
{"text":"Went here the other day with my bf because I'm determined to find a thai place equal to Sugar Thai in Ellensburg, WA...The service here was pretty good although one waiter kept doing this weird nose/throat clearing thing that was kind of disgusting while we were eating.. They were pretty attentive though.

I got the Drunken noodles because I have had them at other places and wanted to compare. I was an idiot however and ordered a 3 star spicy out of 4... aaaaand I could barely eat it let alone taste it. So it was probably really yummy judging by our other foods quality but I don't know... We also order pad thai which was good. And the Spring rolls which were very good. Their peanut sauce is bomb.

I'd probably come back to try other stuff.. They didn't have bubble/boba tea though which I really wanted."}
{"text":"I want to like this place, but the lack of service has definitely put a nail in the coffin in it for me!  I have ordered take out and have also dined in a couple of times each.  For take out, I had to wait an additional 20 minutes after I was told it would be ready in 20 minutes.  As for dining in, the first time I walked out after 10 minutes of not being acknowledged.  The second time the entire lunch took about 1.5 hours.  The final straw was today when I tried to call in a to go order.  I was put on hold for 6.5 minutes.  When I called back, the phone was off of the hook for 3 attempts.  When I finally got someone on the line they proceeded to put me on hold again for 2 minutes and whomever picked up the phone thereafter was extremely rude.  I will never order or go to Nunthaporns again!"}
{"text":"I love thai food and eat it whenever I can. This is the first place in the whole valley I have found that serves my favorite dish evil jungle princess. It is so tasty and they do it very well. They are always busy and servers are always working hard. My fiance has had a few different dishes and is always happy with his picks as well."}
{"text":"I came across this gem of a restaurant when I did a random search for restaurants close to an event I planned on attending.  The food was outstanding and the service is far beyond the norm.  The staff was extremely attentive and friendly. They correctly anticipated when we were ready to order, when we were ready to have plates cleared away, and when we were ready for the check. The food came out at just the right temperature and the timing could not have been any better. If you like Thia cuisine please check this place out.  I will be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"This restaurant feels like a hidden gem every time I eat there. Even though the food is amazing, there's never a wait to be seated and the service is very quick. Every dish we've tried has been delicious. I love the Evil Jungle Princess, panang curry, and, of course, the pad thai. Portions are a good size, too."}
{"text":"This is the only place to go for great supper Thia food
The lunch special is awesome 
We eat here in and take out often
Wait staff is helpful and knowledgeable 
 
You need to try it"}
{"text":"Always the best quality ingredients for the tastiest classic Thai dishes!  The chef is from Thailand and goes back every year to keep up to speed with the latest authentic techniques and flavors.  Definitely worth a visit if you like Eesan/Southeast Asian cuisine!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Service was a little slow but couldn't blame the waiters for being understaffed. But the food was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great little Thai spot in the heart of downtown Mesa. We came in through the back entrance as it had been pouring outside. Unusual for Phoenix, but it did happen! The restaurant is clean and the wait staff was friendly and helpful. We had a few questions about the menu that were answered honestly, so thank you! I had one of the best Thai noodle dishes ever, filled with tofu and veggies, cooked perfectly. My hubby had a rice dish that was too Thai hot for me, but absolutely perfect for him. Yeah!!! Very Good Dining Experience."}
{"text":"Simply put, the service was slower than Moses. But the food wasn't bad.

We were going to Southwest Shakespeare Company tonight to see Taming of the Shrew and met here for dinner. The patio was a great idea as it's one of those lovely January evenings. There were maybe 4 full tables of 2-3 people total at this place when we arrived. We ordered appetizers and the first was quick but then the chicken satay took twice as long as expected. When we ordered the second appetizer, we ordered our meals. I believe we all had the pad thai (three of us). Nothing too difficult to prepare, but we left waiting... and waiting.... and waiting. I took an hour for our meal, which was too long for a smaller place without a lot of people on a a Friday evening. No less than 5 different wait staff attended to us at different times through the evening so they weren't understaffed. \"Our\" waitress (blond haired) apologized for the slowness and said she \"yelled at the kitchen staff for\" us. When we paid the bill, we noticed someone named Joey was supposed to be the waiter. I am pissed that anyone other than this waitress would receive the tip. I hope that didn't happen. Don't know if I will be back here anytime soon. There's a new mexican place across the street; I may go there next time.

Oh yes, as for the food. I have had better pad thai. I asked for a 5 and it was almost too hot to eat. Very sad indeed."}
