{"text":"Good concept but poor follow thru. Bland/bitter courses unevenly seasoned. No salt on mine other party member's overly salted. One of 5 dishes acceptable.this is a pay what you think the dishes are worth restaurant. I find this very offputting."}
{"text":"The food here is INCREDIBLE. The staff is clearly still trying to figure things out (being a newly opened restaurant), so we were there for an hour and a half waiting for our food. However, the food is THAT good that we are completely willing to ignore that part and go again. And that says alot, because we never do that. Every meal is well thought out ingredients-wise. If you are as particular about the ingredients, spices and flavouring used in food, you will appreciate what this chef has to offer. Everything tasted incredible and you can really tell that every detail is paid attention to in the food pairing of every dish. 
We had the starter chickpea and fresh crisps, beet salad, mushroom cauliflower soup, mushroom paella, carrot cake dessert. Everything was incredible. And with the service... we have faith they will figure out the timing of the dishes! We want this place to be in Toronto for a long time!"}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent. Really outstanding and creative vegan offerings. 

However, \"pay what you want\" made us uncomfortable and left us uncertain about whether we were paying too much or too little. Don't want to have to guess at the end of a meal what the value is of what we have just enjoyed. We appreciate the effort that goes into the delicious food, but don't want to pay a guessing game."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience at Awai. Despite an initially complex reservation system and way to communicate, we were blown \"Awai\"! 
Our server Marco was attentive and knowledgable on all the menu items. He described in full detail how the dishes were made and what they were composed of. He also gave us great recommendation on the wine. 
We didn't go for the tasting menu but rather a la carte. Even though we were full, we still shared a dessert because everything was so delicious. 
Would highly recommend. Thank you."}
{"text":"Awai is the place to go if you are a true gourmet foodie. If you can take the time (it's a night of slow eating...) to appreciate how a tiny sprig  of a certain herb can add  the right accent to a dish or the sprinkle of particular seasoning or oil can take a dish to the next level, then Awai is the place to go. The anticipation of what beautiful creation will be presented and fully described next is fun. Knowing that the ingredients are fresh from the restaurant garden or are locally-sourced makes you appreciate the quality of the dish composition even more. No use of animal by-products eases the conscience on a global level of awareness.
All of the dishes my husband and I had last Tuesday evening were excellent:
1. green tomato gazpacho-like soup cleverly served w/ salad on wide rim of bowl: thinly sliced baby zucchini salad dressed w/yuzu vinaigrette and a few pieces of tempura (oil could've been hotter, a bit greasy)
2. \"coca\" bread - southern Spanish flatbread w/ roasted cauliflower, sprigs of marjoram and drizzled w/truffle oil - divine, loved every morsel 
3. edamame ravioli sprinkled w/grilled corn kernels and some delicious sauce (can't remember what kind, there were so many, but it paired well)
4. gnocchi and caramelized shallots w/ kale salad and curry velout√© : too many gnocchi becomes doughy and very filling - smokey flavours tasty)
5. Indian pancake/bread (very dense parantha) served w/ grilled baby tomatoes and Spanish olive and caper medley: because this dish has the same smoke-infused flavour as the gnocchi, it's a bit overkill on the smoke flavour and  you O.D.on it; doughiness of pancake too much after gnocchi dish, portion could have been much smaller - it was the only dish we did not finish and we only ordered one to share!
5. rich dark chocolate ganache served w/sour cherries and sprinkled w/ olive oil based icing sugar-type of crumbled \"cheese\" - delicious pairing! Love dark chocolate and cherries, ChocoSol has a bar made of same combo... delish!!!
The in-house brewed beverages were a bit watered down due to the ice to really appreciate their flavours (ginger beer, kombucha) 
Fantastic service. 
Gets a little noisy when restaurant is full. 
Bill is a bit awkward..."}
{"text":"Best soup I've ever had! I don't even like mushrooms, but this porcini soup was amazing!

Also, the first time I've had truffles! Well worth the cost for the paella dish.

The server was very knowledgeable about the wine list and suggested wines that went well with our food.

My new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"If there were six stars, we would tap all six. My girlfriend and I visited this place on Friday. We're not vegetarian, but heard this place was rated #1 in Now Magazine and figured we'd give it a shot. VERY glad we did. The evening started off with the warmest, most courteous and friendly hospitality we'd seen outside of a five-star hotel. Then a beautiful selection of rare wines and beverages, from which I selected a crisp Italian white and my girlfriend enjoyed a home-made fermented drink named Kombucha. Both outstanding. The tasting menu was 7 courses and we didn't want it to stop. We started with the famous cocas - a wood-fired dough crispy and tender - ours came with artichoke hearts, basil microgreens, roasted pine nuts and more. The soup was creamy cauliflower with a porccini mushroom duxcell in the center and wild mustard oil. They soak the mustard seeds and throw a couple in, which gives you a tiny pop with each bite. Heavenly. Followed by a baby-kale, smoked chickpea and sherry-vinegar salad. The first main was a pistachio-crusted squash dumpling and rapini-veloutte. The outside is slightly pan seared which gives a beautiful texture. They tasted like gourmet gnocchis; not even sure how to describe it, really. Then came a mushroom ravioli with a red wine reduction which tasted absolutely exotic to us. Almost like it had a hint of pomegranate. It melted in our mouth and was very satisfying. These guys use top-notch and super expensive ingredients that you would never find at most restaurants. The dessert was a caramel-apple and golden-beet creme brulee. Let me tell you, this was the best creme brulee I've ever had. They caramelize the sugar so perfectly, and the dessert itself reminds me of working in the apple orchards. Everything was so fresh and flavourful. We're going to go back next week and bring a few friends. Thank you, thank you, thank you for a wonderful experience!!"}
{"text":"There are three kinds of vegan restaurants: those that care about the food and not the atmosphere, those that care about the atmosphere and not the food, and those that care about both. Awai wants to be the last. They also try to create original vegan dishes rather than faux meat or vegan versions of animal dishes. Bravo!!! They succeed to some extent, but at a cost. My main course was ten tiny sogged potatoes (half the size of my little finger), a few green leaves and sauce. The bowl was large, the serving was small, very small, for $19. Dessert was one baked pear squirted inside with chocolate and dipped in watered-down chocolate for $12. I also had a $3 chickpea pancake. All of it was well presented and tasty BUT not worth the cost. I'm a vegan and have eaten at every possible vegan food place. Planta has claims to be the best. It too has some delicious items, but again not worth the cost. If you are prepared to spend at least $35 per person (not including drinks), and (at Awai) will accept tiny portions, then enjoy. For me Fresh and Thrive have more for the dollar."}
{"text":"Food was impeccable and the whole experience was unique. Servers were very professional and sincere. There's no menu - the chef prepares a variety of dishes based on what was fresh or inspiring that day and you're served until you're full. Everything is prepared to order to do expect to spend 1.5 to 2 hours having dinner.

You pay what you like. Beverages are separate and have specific prices. A cocktail was $15 but it was a heavy pour. I took one sip and could feel it. My companion finished that one drink and I ended up driving. 

Flavors were deep and complex. The chef likes things natural and many dishes have an earthy taste. We had a green bean salad, a flat bread pizza with shishito peppers, a soup, incredible ravioli pouches, an Asian pancake, hummus, and  a few other dishes. Several had an Indian spice theme. The folks next to us were eating gluten free and getting some of the same dishes as us and some different. 

Expect about 6 courses to fill you up, with some folks stopping at 5. My curiosity about what would come next got the better of me and we went for 7 dishes, which was a bit too much. 

For as fancy as it was, I would have expected the silverware to be cleared after every course. As it was, our silverware was cleared when it wasn't on our plate and then left with us when we put it on our plate. There was no way to predict which made transitions a little awkward.

Dessert was actually a bit disappointing but everything else was excellent. I'm guessing the chef doesn't like to use refined sugar and the fruit gazpacho just wasn't flavorful enough to fully comppliment the simple doughnut.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It is with a heavy heart I have to give this place only a 3. I wanted to love it, our whole party wanted to, but alas. 
It is the menu that disappoints the most. 
One of the flatbreads was overbaked and hard as a rock (why didn't we call that out??). And their turnip dish was a complete miss (doughy unflavoured balls). One of the soups has \"free refills\" next to it, so surprisingly, when asked for seconds there was a general negative vibe (even a comment) to indicate it wasn't welcome. Hits: artichoke ravioli, daily curry, the aforementioned mushroom soup. 
The service was adequate.
And please, restaurants, stop cramming everyone up front (for efficiency, I get it, and also to portray business to the passers by) when the other half is empty. The amount of noise was deafening, in what should have been a more relaxed atmosphere.
Decent experience but will NOT be back."}
{"text":"Inconsistent preparation, and many dishes were also ill conceived. In six courses I can't say I enjoyed a single dish. 

Here's the horrifying kicker: They make you choose how much you pay. To guilt you into ponying up they ask how you enjoyed each course and actually made us go around the table to say our favorite item. Had to gag each time and pretend to be enjoying myself. Blech!"}
{"text":"Damn. Damn damn damn damn. The food here at Awai is next level. Like actually on some kind of higher plane above other food. We came here in my birthday a couple of weeks ago and I am still struggling to find words for it.
With that struggle still a thing, we had 7 courses. Each course is a small enough portion that you'll make room for more and you'll want to. Everything is different. Flavour is kicked up and presentation is spot on. Earthy notes are common in the food but that's not to say you won't get something with a bit of zing. Don't be intimidated by the rotating menu (or lack thereof). Trust in this place. I'll admit I am sometimes a bit of a picky and cautious eater but just throw caution out for this place and try what they offer (unless you have an allergy but they'll ask you that in advance).
One criticism is one that many share. The \"pay what you feel\" system is intimidating and the clarity of what they think is fair would be appreciated. It's a great spot and as a patron you want to be generous. But some of us live on a budget and this place is just a treat. But at the end of the night this gripe is pretty trivial anyway."}
{"text":"My group and I really wanted to love our meal here. We've been to multiple vegan establishments in the city and were so interested after hearing about Awai. But unfortunately it was a miss for us. 

We had the 7 course meal, there wasn't an option for a la carte. Some dishes were great and some were not. I didn't find some of the dishes to be very inventive or interesting to the palate. For example, a dish of asparagus cooked different ways and plated together, was not what I had expected. Some dishes were a little too inventive, like our dessert dish of strawberry gazpacho. The flavours of this dish did not come together too nicely, and it left a more savoury impression rather than sweet. 

Lastly, the pay what you want concept is interesting in theory but in actuality it was a bit distressing for our group. We weren't sure if we were paying too much or too little. It was a guessing game at what we thought the ingredients and how the dishes had come together, would be worth. In all honesty, I would rather pay a set price and receive a quality meal rather than guess at what I'm paying and receive dishes where taste and quality are compromised. 

Our servers were great, though. They did a nice job of describing our dishes as they came out. An extra savoury course was offered if we were still feeling hungry. We were told there was no need to tip, and if we did it'd be appreciated but not necessary. Not sure if we were there on an off night, as there are so many good reviews. But after our experience here we're not sure if any of us will be back."}
{"text":"This was one of the better meals I have had in Toronto across any category, never mind vegan. Every single thing about Awai works- the beautiful and hilariously described wine list, an omikase approach to dining consisting of 5 or 6 equally exquisite courses - each one a winner, running the range through earthy, fresh, spicy, comforting and decadent. Friendly and attentive servers. Pay what you want pricing. No tipping expected. It's joyous food by people who want you to be happy. And succeed abundantly, delightfully and deliciously."}
{"text":"We had 7 courses overall, each one is unique with a wow factor. Love the overall experience! For sure will come back for another treat"}
{"text":"A new restaurant near Runnymede and Bloor, just minutes away from Runnymede station.
Open during the evenings, this place presents you with dim lights, candles, and the aroma of wood from the wood-fire oven.

The menu includes a nice selection of vegan options, so for those with dietary preferences that is a bonus. There are also a number of wines and teas available, and you may also have the opportunity to try a vegetable juice.

Every dish is made to order, hand-crafted on the spot and served very fresh.
As a result, dishes may take somewhat longer to serve up.

Mushroom and cauliflower soup was amazing.
Favourite dishes are the Coca bread and the Gnocci."}
{"text":"Awai has a locally-sourced, plant-based menu that doesn't shy away from inventive seasonings and flavours from around the world. It is rustic fare that is comforting, satisfying and made with a simple elegance. I have often lamented the lack of vegan restaurants in Toronto that really take care to coax out the natural flavours from vegetables without resorting to hiding them in sauces or deep-frying. At Awai, vegetables are truly the focus here, and why shouldn't they deserve their time in the candlelight? I especially enjoyed the wild porcini soup and artichoke ravioli. For fun, be sure to read through the wine descriptions, which as my dining companion noted are poetic and whimsical. I look forward to returning in the future!"}
{"text":"Okay where do I even begin with this experience. I'll admit when we arrived, we were not aware of the tasting course structure and that it was pay what you want. Who I believe was the manager came over and graciously explained the concept, and asked us for any allergies, and we were a little let's say scared of what was to come--would we like the food, since it will all be a surprise? 7 courses?! But we were ready to try it especially after finding out the ingredients come from their garden out back and their farm up north.

To start with the wine (which I didn't have), the table raved over it, and gave it very high praise. Shortly after the first dish arrived: a pea gazpacho with pistachio dust. The best word to describe it was \"beautiful\". Next came a cucumber salad with a flax crisp, cabbage, pumpkin seeds, and a hazelnut vinaigrette. Extremely light and refreshing, and while we were happily munching away they brought the star of the meal: a sourdough flatbread. I don't remember all of the components but it was beyond fantastic. The base was made from leeks and the topping had a blend of peppers, chickpeas, almonds and was spiced to perfection. I would have eaten that ten times over. Following was a mushroom ravioli, which I didn't try as I hate mushrooms, but the whole table devoured and said the best ravioli that had ever had--apparently extremely soft and not at all doughy. Once we had finished this dish they asked us how our appetites were and suggested bringing the next dish split between the four of us. It was a gnocchi with a spinach pur√©e and wilted on top. This is probably the best thing I've ever smelled in my life, but I'm not a huge potato fan, so it wasn't a highlight for me. We then opted to skip the next course and head onto dessert where they brought three small tastes: a strawberry and chocolate truffle dish. Fresh and delicious. A pana cotta with \"flower salad\" which was the best part of the dessert, but the pana cotta itself was a little too gel-y and an apple tart of sorts that was amazing as well.

Love how attentive the service was and that they throughly explained each dish. At one point the chefs brought our dish out which was so appreciative so we could compliment his beautiful work. It was definitely one of the best dining experiences we have ever had."}
{"text":"Snobby. Full of themselves. They didn't take us in on a Tuesday night because they were \"understated\" when they clearly had open seats by the bar. Hostess - snobby. Her \"colleague\" who might be the restaurant manager - snobby as well. He said: \"next time!\" - there won't be a next time."}
{"text":"I feel a bit guilty giving a place I have never tried 1 star but something needs to be said for the process to make a reservation.  In March, I wanted to take a friend here for her birthday.  I left a voicemail requesting a reservation for 3 people.  About a week later, they left a voicemail confirming a reservation for 2 people.  I called back immediately to correct the reservation.  It seems the phone goes to an automatic voicemail so I left a voicemail with the correct information.  About a week later, someone called back to confirm (a day before the intended reservation).  Of course, by this point, we had chosen another restaurant (I don't live in the area and seems risky to show up with 3 people on a Friday night without knowing with certainty that there will be a table for 3).  I explained the situation to the associate who called and I suggested they make the reservation process easier.  She agreed and felt bad for my experience. 

Fast forward to last week, I tried to make a reservation once again.  I left a voicemail (specifically asking that they call me back to confirm the details for the requested date) and even sent a \"comment\" through the website with the desired reservation including my contact info.  Never heard back once again.

Can't say I will try for a third time.  Pretty disappointing that there isn't an easier way to make a reservation.  This probably speaks to the type of service I would experience if I ate at this establishment so probably best I give my business to another vegan restaurant that is appreciative of my business."}
{"text":"I am really sorry, I wanted so badly to love this place. I love eating vegan foods, and it makes it all the more fun when I can go out with my friends and we can all share in the experience together. This place fell Awai (ha - get it?) short of my expectations. 

First of all, there is no menu, they legitimately make whatever 7 course meal they feel like making that day with whatever ingredients they have that day. The cool part of that is that everything is fresh, the less cool part would be if you are a picky eater (which I am not, so that's Awai-okay..haha I did it again!). Other downside to that is that if you really like a dish, you probably won't be able to get it again if you returned.

Second, the service is super nice. They are very attentive, knowledgeable, and descriptive when talking about the dishes placed in front of you. They also offer an additional savoury course at the end if you are still hungry before offering dessert, so that was cool, but my group felt ready to move on, so we opted out of the surprise 8th course. 

Third, the food, while artfully prepared, was perhaps a little too unique for my taste. Maybe I am just a simpleton who knows nothing, but really, I am happier to eat a salad with a variety of leafy greens and other garden-fresh vegetables and a simple (but delicious) dressing, than a dish with 4 different kinds of asparagus that have been shaved, broiled, charred, and chopped. Again, maybe I am just unrefined, that's ok! 

Finally, because there is no menu, there is no price, you pay what you can. I think they recommend $30 sans booze and $50 with booze (tru because I did purchase a $15 glass of wine, it was good, but what was I thinking??). Honestly, this part stressed me out the most. We weren't sure how much was fair and if we should tip or how much we should tip. It got really crazy and sort of ruined the whole rest of the experience because we left on a confused and sort of sour note from the payment process. 

Again, I really did want to love it here, but I don't know that I will return to Awai despite all the positive reviews."}
{"text":"This restaurant exceeded my expectations. Food was very flavorful (especially the soups and ravioli dish), the service was awesome and they have some great wine by the glass options. I also appreciated how the tables where not so close to one another so you could have a private conversation without the people next to you hearing everything. Tuesdays is \"pay what you can\" which is an interesting concept. Overall, I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Was really excited to come here as it is vegan but was really disappointed with the longggg wait between courses and inconsistency with their service.

The food tasted great but really small sizes and like I said a LONG wait between courses so I was literally so hungry the entire time I was there

I was there for 2.5 hours but couldn't manage it anymore. I was still so hungry - none of their dishes filled me up and their service was also really bad. 

They only had one girl serving about 10 tables so she was barely around - then the chefs came with dishes but the one Asian chef could barely explain what he was serving and he spoke in a huge slur. 

Again the wait was so long and myself and the person I ate with were fed up with the service and wait. We came hungry and left even more hungry. It's just so sad because the restaurant has so much potential but everything else about it besides their food was terrible. Also for dessert we were given a dish to share - like uh? For the other courses we didn't have to share, why are we stuck sharing a dessert?

The pay what you want is also terrible. You put a number down on a paper and then they come work out your HST. What is the point when you're basically guilt tripped into over paying. 

I'm honestly shocked we even managed to sit there for 2.5 hours. I think what makes this worse was that being vegetarian I love support plant based restaurants but with the long wait and leaving more hungry than when I entered - I left to go to another restaurant just to get faster service and to actually be full. 

Please change your restaurant format - a proper a la carte menu, faster more professional service and a standard cost per dish."}
{"text":"this was such an amazing and unique dining experience! the food was incredibly tasty and so nicely portioned. best vegan food I've had out, will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We were not expecting to be blown away, but we were. Great space, nice staff and creativity beyond compare. Each dish was unique and very enjoyable. Best of all, we didn't feel bloated and weighted down afterwards.
This was quite a feat for vegetarian food!"}
{"text":"The concept of this place is very impressive. Each time of day is a different set menu, and you and your party choose how many dishes you receive until you tell them when to stop. The place is vegan-friendly, and surprisingly the portions seem small - but, after you have received several plates, you will feel full after the first couple of dishes.

The food is super tasty and beautifully decorated. I am not vegan, but I find that as someone who does not live this lifestyle to have found the food and experience enjoyable and fun. 

The best part of it all is that you get to pay whatever you want by the end of the meal! They include the gratuity/tip, and you decide however much you want to pay. 

The servers come every round to break down the dish and are willing to answer any questions or concerns you may have about the food.

Walking inside, I was expecting the aesthetic of the place to be a little bit more vibrant and bold to fit with their stream of colorful foods, but the environment is neutral and warm.

I would come back here in the future! I love the idea of it all."}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal. The experience is utterly unique in Toronto. A totally personal experience involving the owner/head chef getting to know exactly what tastes/flavours/experience you're looking for, then pretty much working around you. We went on a Friday night during a soft opening, the service was still being fine tuned, but the food, atmosphere and experience was fantastic. This is a chef working at the top of his game. Wholeheartedly recommend to any serious food lover. Staff were great, s still getting to grips with a new restaurant and service but attentive and friendly. If you enjoy food this place needs to be experienced."}
{"text":"The food was very good! Even forgot that it was a vegan restaurant. 
Started with the olives and almond bowl, got to love a restaurant that offers snack size appetizers so you have something to nibble on while waiting for your food. 
Moved on to the mushroom \"paella.\" It was wonderful! Not a huge portion, but I also didn't end up finishing it because it was very filling. 
Creme caramel for dessert. Didn't even think about the fact that custard isn't vegan, but the creme caramel was wonderful and I didn't care one bit that it was made from Vegetables!! I don't know how they got a vegetable to taste that good and sweet, but they definitely succeeded. 
Lost one start because the menu isn't super long, but would still go back to try more!
Oh and service was EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday and had the tasting menu - we weren't made aware of any other option.  So basically no menu, they just bring you food (we were expecting this).

Good food.  Enjoyed all courses with the exception of maybe one not as much.  Long wait between small courses. My wife and I had 8 courses each (they're small), after the 5th they asked us if we wanted dessert, so I guess we had 2 more than the standard.  Its your choice, they'll keep bringing you different courses if you'd like.  

Very expensive. There is no set price for the food, you pay what you want with a suggestion of between $12 and $22 /per course (so X 16 for us)."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 7 adults and a baby at 5 and we got seated immediately! We had our drink orders taken right away and water reffils were done promptly! The servers were amazing, made awesome drink suggestions and came up with interesting combos for our party( cranberry and pomegranate with seeds and berries, annisete ginger beer) cream soda and anissete( didn't try them but i heard mixed feelings)  the food as u will see from the pictures below were picture perfect but the flavours were not spectacular).  First was a flatbread with potatoes, mushrooms and garlic spread) up next miso mushroom soup that was horrible, next was a salad with beets fennel apple crisps, then came a mushroom raviolli, then a spring roll like pastry with a filling of a super salty( yuck) riccotta like moose and a beet fennel  rice that looked like a crab cake). The desserts were mixed and paired amazingly with french press coffee and almond milk) would i go back to this restaurant( maybe, during another season once the items update )"}
{"text":"I wanted to like Awai. I was excited about this new vegan restaurant that was getting such rave reviews. It started off good with the spiced olives and almonds and their version of hummus with homemade crisps (which were soft but still tasty). The service was very slow and it took awhile before we were served our two flatbreads. When I asked the waitress what the crust was made of she indignantly replied \"dough\". Uh huh. The other three dishes arrived after another long wait. The menu descriptions of the dishes sounded interesting and delicious but when we ate them they were not that flavorful. I'm not sure whether it was an off night as the reviews have been exceptional. I'm not sure I want to go back."}
{"text":"I'm so happy we have Awai in our neighbourhood!  We were big fans of the chef when he ran \"The Atlantic\" and he has brought that outstanding skill to a vegan menu.  We've been there twice, and every dish we had was outstanding.  If a tasting menu is available, I highly recommend it as a way to get to try many great dishes. Wine list is small but interesting, and the service is super friendly."}
{"text":"My friend really wanted to eat here for her birthday meal in August. We had made a reservation two weeks prior via text for 6pm, but a few days later, I needed to change the time as one friend couldn't leave work until 7pm. I sent 3 texts and tried calling twice but got no response. My friend called and we were told they would make it work for us. I did eventually get a confirmation text a few hours before the reservation.
Upon arrival we had to sit on the patio until a table was free for us. It was cool and windy out so we were happy to be moved indoors after 20-30 minutes.
The staff were friendly and informative. The menu was only for drinks. The way the food works is the chef sends out several courses but they do ask upon being seated if anyone has any allergies or aversions.
Two of us were vegan and gluten free and the third was a willing participant. We wanted to try whatever was presented to us.
Each course brought to us was flavourful, unique and artistically prepared. We loved every course! We were asked after the 4th and 5th course if we wanted to go on to the next course or to dessert. We were getting full so we asked what the next course was. The chef would not tell us as it would ruin the surprise. We opted to get one order and share it so we could experience it without overeating. We were not disappointed
After dessert we had tea and coffee and then the bill arrived. The cost of the wine, sparkling water and tea/coffee were charged. We were told we could pay what we wanted for the food. We asked for a suggestion and they said the average is $65-80pp but we could pay whatever. We chose $70pp for the food as it was fresh, unique and very tasty. When using credit card, there is no option for tip, so you literally pay whatever you want including tip. Our $70pp plus drink cost was our final price.
Looking forward to going back with other vegetarian friends in late September!"}
{"text":"What an incredible meal!  Went with a group of meat eaters, only 2 of us were not meat eaters... and everyone was instantly converted!!  First off, service was spot on.  Everyone was incredibly friendly, knowledgable and made the meal very special.  Now onto the food, all I can say is you have to eat there to really understand how special it is.  Chef Isberg has really nailed plant based cooking.  His flavours had so much depth, every bite was not only a surprise, but an absolute pleasure.  We had the tasting menu with some very well thought out wines to match.  The wines were also vegan (which I had no idea was even a thing!) with a whimsical description on the menu of each.  You can tell a lot of thought and love was placed into choosing wines. A must do in Bloor West Village!"}
{"text":"Interesting concept, but hasn't reached its potential, unfortunately.  It's pay-what-you-wish, no-menu.  As they say \"We just cook for you!\"  However, they did not cook for \"us,\" they just brought whatever, despite asking about tastes and whatnot.  

They did not speak well about the dishes, didn't describe with details.  Didn't even mention the micro-greens are grown right there on site and you can even see the green-house spot.  I just happened to read about it.  Not good self-promoters. 

They also messed up our drink order. We ordered non-alcoholic but it came reeking of gin. 

We were two adults and one savvy 8-year-old.  Before we decided to eat there, we asked if the menu included things like pasta, potatoes, beans, soup, etc. that he knows he likes and they said oh yes he'll be fine!  But instead they brought things like fennel salad, flatbread with more fennel and eggplant, etc. (which the adults liked fine but had nothing to do with the conversation about kids' preference).  

We all three were served the same dishes.  Similarly with the cocktails, we asked for a citrus-based non-alcoholic drink for him, like a Shirley Temple.  She brought what was basically soda water with licorice/anise syrup.  Even the kid thought it was too sweet.  And he doesn't like licorice.  Orange juice with fizzy water would have been fine.  Luckily I got hibiscus lemonade so we just switched drinks and all was fine. 

Servers were nice enough but not very attentive.  Three different people served us on and off, so there was also no consistency.  Given the concept, it seemed off."}
{"text":"Cool experience: pay whatever you want with unidentified menu. 

The experience to book this place was pretty unpleasant. They don't pick up any calls but you can basically only make a reservation through phone. There is an option to text though, which is what we did. They don't reply back right away so you kind of have to wait a day or two to know if you're reservation is actually confirmed. We ended up having to change the time to our reservation and that again took a few hours before it was finally confirmed. 

We had a seven course meal including dessert and I'd say that majority of the items were really good while some were just mediocre. They started us off which soup, then salad, flatbread, and then some dumpling sort of thing. Then they asked us if we were still hungry..which we were, so they brought or another dish, a potato gnocchi, by which point we were pretty full so the last dish was the dessert. 

The food all has a unique kick to it but nothing was OMG to die for. We ended up paying about $135 for the entire meal. Despite the cool concept, tbh it is kind of overwhelming to not know whether you've paid enough or overpaid for your meal. 

They have a $25 3 course meal option at the bar which seems like a pretty good deal for next time I want to come but given how small the portions were, I doubt 3 courses would fill me up. 

Overall, great experience, the servers were really polite and informative, I'd come here again."}
{"text":"My posse and I went on a rainy night, and it was very busy which is a good sign! When Toronto Life rates you as one of their best new restaurants, and you are supposedly the best vegan resto in town, people take notice!
I was not disappointed. I had the mushroom soup, while it wasn't the best soup I've ever had, it was very flavourful and very creatively presented. 
I also had the artichoke ravioli which was really amazing! The wine was great too.
Tips are included in the price. The restaurant has a modern aesthetic and it's trendy, and the service was friendly and the waitress was very knowledgeable. 
It's very close to Runnymede station in Bloor West Village, so easy to get to, and I will definitely return for more of their delicious eats!"}
{"text":"In terms of providing a high end tasting menu and ambiance, Awai is not quite there. I've done the vegan tasting at George and Alo and while Awai recommends (it's pay what you can) that you pay a similar price point as these places it's slightly lacking both in ambiance, and food offerings.

Overall most dishes we quite good. We managed six mains and the dessert.

The only course we did not enjoy was course four, the Indian lentils with beets. It was quite bland and flavourless. A real let down. The Portuguese wine it was paired with was the only good component of that course. The real hit was the cauliflower ravioli and dishes should be at that quality level."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service and ambience.  They take time explaining the food and ingredients.  To pay what you want which we paid about $70 per person for 6 courses."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to us from the chef/owner of Solasta (a great vegan spot in Oakville). Taking his advice, we tried Awai out yesterday evening. We were very impressed! 

With the \"pay what you like\" option, you are served up to 7 courses- but you can stop at any point or fast forward to desert. 

Our dinner started with a flatbread that was scrumptious. Very unique pairing of rapini with a pear pur√©e as the base. Rapini was nice and crisp, which was excellent. 

The following dish was a soup with various greens and tofu. We really enjoyed the broth of the soup. 
We then had a salad that had sweet potatoes pasta, greens, cherry tomatoes and a nice dressing. The next dish was a mushroom ravioli. We were curious as to the next dish, put getting pretty full. We opted to get it- a almond based gnocchi with a delicious pistachio sauce. Very filling dish!

Last put not least was desert! This was one of our favourite dishes. A parsnip creme br√ªl√©e and a Seminole cake with cashew ganache! Boy was it good! Very light, but so satisfying. 

The servers were all very nice and hospitable. We will definitely be coming back sometime soon."}
{"text":"Interesting concept , pay whatever you like!. Be prepared to have a conversation between courses as delivery is slow, pleasant service, as for the food , well it is up to you to decide"}
{"text":"This restaurant really impressed me. First, the concept - no menu, just dishes until you say \"stop\".  And Pay what you want. The first part of the concept was very impressive. We were at the first seating and the table next to us had totally different dishes than we had, which means that the kitchen has a LOT on the go (each table had 7 dishes). 
The second concept, pay what you can, is a bit stressful. 

The food was excellent. I should probably mention that o am not vegan and generally find that vegan food is characterized by \"missing something\". This restaurant may have been the first time I have had vegan food that did not seem to be missing anything. The dishes were inventive, beautiful to look at and very tasty. There was very little in the way of fake cheese or fake meat. Generally, just simple ingredients, standing as themselves in delicious food. 

The location is nice. One big room with a bar towards the middle. High ceiling but nice and toasty warm (I was there when it was very cold out). The staff were very friendly. No attitude. The service was very attentive at first and then fell off towards the end of the meal. I don't know if it was because it got busier or if it was just less necessary as we slowed our pace. It was not inconvenient until we were looking for a bill, which took some time. Interestingly, while we were allowed to ask the server to bring us a dish that the neighbouring table was eating, the server was prohibited from telling us what the neighbouring table was eating. 

All in all, I highly recommend this place for a nice dinner out. I do wish they would drop the pay what you want bit but moreover, I hope my guess was an accurate value for the experience."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!

Their tasting menu. Whether it be 4 course, 6 course or eat as much as you can possible, it's worth a dining experience here. 

This restaurant is a 100% vegan, plant based restaurant meaning that they source all their ingredients in their dishes from either their garden in the back and on their roof top or they have a farm they get their ingredients from at the Tomaskin First Nations farm. You won't see a menu because they make their menus based on what is in season and prepare their dishes accordingly. 

The bench mark they give people when paying is $45 for 4 course, $65 for 6 courses and then if you go for the eat as much as you want at whatever price the customer sees fit based on the experience, the food and the service. 

I never though vegan dishes can taste so good until I came here. Very creative with the dishes they make and they try to nicely present the food too. They use lots of curries and spices in their dishes though so if you're a fan of curry and spice, then you'll like this restaurant!

My favorite dish was the mushroom soup and the black and white pappardelle.  Mushroom soup because I love anything mushroom and there were a lot of mushroom pieces in the soup. The black and white pappardelle was unique because of the way they presented the dish and the texture of the fresh pasta. 

LAST TIP??

If you opt to go with the pay whatever amount you want option, when the bill comes, it won't have a price written on the receipt so you put the amount you want to be charged on the receipt. They will then add the taxes separately to the amount you want to be charged. You can either add tip after the taxes or let the server know how much of the amount you were going to pay that is suppose to be allocated to the tip!! Remember, the amount you want to pay is the pre-tax amount!!"}
{"text":"Our first time coming to Awai and had the seven course pairing. Every dish was amazing with impeccable service, and beautiful ambiance. I highly recommend this place to all vegans and vegetarians. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner from  a recommendation!

I was a huge fan of their preparation style, and their unique preposition of serving an unlimited, ever-changing tasting menu. I generally eat fairly healthy so I was happy with the fresh vegan options, but it could definitely not appease a lot of carnivores.

What I wasn't a huge fan of, was the way they explained it: You could either pick their 5 course set menu for $55 or their unlimited \"pay as you want\" option. We did the 5 courses at first, but since I asked for gluten-free, I couldn't have one of the menu items because it was shared. Unfortunate much? I asked for an alternative and they didn't provide one.

At the end, I asked for one more item to move into the \"pay what you want\" meal, and they accommodated for it with a nice curry platter with gluten free chickpea bread. That was probably the most filling part of the meal that I got a bit too stuffed so I had to pass on dessert. The rest of my party had to all wait for my final meal as well, since they all did the 5 courses (I guess, try not to get different amount of orders if you're not a fan of waiting for your friends).

From the one experience, I would say I loved the spices, the food prep and the ingredients, but their structure is a bit disorganized. Would come again though to try something new!"}
{"text":"I wish I remembered the names/descriptions of these dishes, but all in all a wonderful experience. The element of surprise was cool. Would've been nice if we were able to pick our options for the prix fix though, or if we were asked what we were in the mood for - I saw some adjoining tables getting dishes that might've been nice to try as well. Nonetheless, we had delicious food and we loved the plant based aspect."}
{"text":"My husband is a vegetarian, and I eat meat but we tried this restaurant due to the reviews and reputation of the chef. We are so glad we did! 

The space is quite simple without any frills or gimmicks. The star of the show is definitely the food. We had the tasting menu which was 6 courses. What we found quite unusual was that towards the end of the meal we were asked if we were still hungry. This seemed awkward but we think an extra course was added on when we said that we were still hungry which we appreciated!

The menu is heavily based on mushrooms, so if you don't like those you may not enjoy it. There were a lot of dishes we still did not try so I would visit again.

The bill came to about $200 for the two of us including two glasses of wine and a bottomless glass of ginger beer which my husband had refilled twice."}
