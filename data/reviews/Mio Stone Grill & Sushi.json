{"text":"Just great. We are an hour away but it is now our new favourite sushi Restraunt. It was rated #1 in the Airdrie area on Yelp and it didn't lead us astray. Had the lunch combo. Lots on the platter, fresh, great service, all for a reasonable cost."}
{"text":"Love their salmon sashimi! (Good size with just enough fat). Their salmon cheeks is really good! A must try. Overall food is really tasty. Definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"A very nice restaurant with great udon and sushi.  The stone grill was a nice way to cook food and it was tasty."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this Japanese restaurant while driving by a plaza in South Airdrie.  It turned out to be a great dinner and value. 
 
We started off with prawn sunomono salad that was a very generous portion, as was the miso soup.  My only criticism of the dinner was the sunomono as the liquid was very intense and to my taste, should have been thinned way out to reduce the vinegar sweet/sour intensity.  
We ordered the stone grill dinner.  The server brings a hot rock slab to your table with 8 oz of various meats such as lamb, beef, prawn, scallop and salmon.  You smear butter on the stone which is sizzling hot and then place your cut up meats on the slab and wait 3 or 4 minutes for them to cook.  The stone dinner included miso soup and a tasty salad.  There were 3 dipping sauces included with the entree which were good to very good.  They included a spicy mayo, steak sauce and teriyaki sauce.  I felt the steak sauce could have been a bit better, but it was decent.  

We had some salmon sushi that was very creamy in texture and excellent and sesame ice cream that my wife liked a lot and she thought was an excellent alternative to the usual dessert options.  

The atmosphere is very nice and service was great.  We'd be happy to return to this great restaurant whenever in the area."}
{"text":"The lunch box is always something to look forward to and for a reasonable price. Friendly staff and service."}
{"text":"I was recommend by a new fellow yelper Rita W. to this restaurant. Since my new work place located up north. So I decided at food tour drive all they way to Airdrie to try out this restaurant with another yelp elite James C. 

Base on my analytical review are very similar to yelper Rita W because I ordered the hot rock stone dinner. I am not going to write too much stuff on it. Although, the services was excellent base on weekdays. James order weekday set dinner only cost $20. With miso soup, sommonos, dynamite roll, assorted tempura, calamari, and more I can't remember. 

This is a hidden gem in Airdrie, I will definitely will return for update review."}
{"text":"Tempura was slow coming but excellent when arrived. Sushi selections were well prepared and tasty. Beef Udon was a little too sweet for our taste."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people back home are going to think I'm nut for saying this, but it's true...There is better sushi in and around Calgary than there is in Vancouver!  This is where you'll find it.

It's not cheap, but you pay for what you get and this is better than I've had back in BC.  We weren't sure about trying it but a few of the yelp Elite had posted good reviews, nevermind the history of reviews encouraging a positive experience, so we gave it a shot.

D had a miso soup which I might try next time - it wasn't too salty even after adding a little soysauce and had just the right balance of green onion and creamy tofu.

We shared a prawn tempura, the batter light and crispy, well seasoned, wrapped around perfect fresh prawns.  On the side was a lemon wedge with some kind of powder on it (looked like wasabi powder but we're not entirely sure what it was) and some fluffy ginger.  We squeezed the lemon with weird powder into the tempura sauce and added some of the white fluffy ginger, and wow was that ever the best tempura sauce we've ever had!

On a whim I ordered my usual Chicken Karaage, which came out as lollypop style with a spicy mayo dip.  Normally you see those and think \"That is going to be dry or undercooked\" but you would be wrong - they were juicy, perfectly cooked, and light.  The batter around them was seasoned well enough you didn't need the dip, but you would use the dip anyway because it had flavour that just popped with the chicken.

We also tried one Ebi Special roll each which was super spicy and fresh, a Smoked Sake Nigiri each that was very fresh but had a very very light smoke flavour, and he tried the Unagi Nigiri which supposedly was better than Benkey in Aldergrove - hard to believe since even I would eat that one!

I tried the Negitoro roll, very fresh and light, I've gotten used to the chunky green onion most places use so the light strands were a surprise.  We each got a Philadelphia roll because there's no sharing that one!  Chilled cream cheese with fresh salmon, avocado, and leftover spicy mayo to dip it in?  The best!

The last roll that we took our time on was the Salmon Isobe roll.  We weren't sure what to expect with this one so when it came out we didn't recognize it at first.  Spicy sauce on the plate with the rolls neatly laid out.  The rolls themselves were salmon wrapped in the seeweed and a super light tempura-like batter.  It was obvious that the rolls had been dipped in a frier just long enough to crisp the batter and sear the fish without loosing any of the freshness - that takes some serious skills!  To get that timing right, kudos to the cook!

We love this place and will be going back for sure!!  You can tell the staff are doing what they love when you walk into this restaurant."}
{"text":"We decided to try a restaurant in Airdrie, and after hearing some good reviews - decided on Mio sushi and stone grill.

Atmosphere: 4/5  Overall clean, modern, and quiet on a weekday evening.  Spacious interior. 
 Plenty of parking available.

Food: 4/5  There were a number of menu options.  Since the restaurant was named after its stone grill, we decided to give it a try.  The stone grill was definitely a neat way to cook food, although I have yet to figure out how the stone is kept hot enough for the duration of time that we had been cooking.  There were a few sauces that came with the grill that are used after food is cooked.  We also had some sushi which were fresh and delicious, as well as salad, miso soup, and ended with green tea / vanilla ice cream.  Overall an interesting and satisfying meal!

Service: 4/5 Attentive and friendly service

Price: 3/5  Reasonable prices

Overall: 4/5  This was an interesting stone grill experience in a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere.  I would return to try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"My opinion, Best sushi in Airdrie! They have wonderful friendly staff, great service (in-house/takeout) the food is always fresh and the menu has options to please everyone."}
{"text":"Easily the best sushi I've had in a long time.   I've found my new sushi hangout.  you can tell the owners take plenty of pride in all aspects of their establishment, right down to all the little details."}
{"text":"I order from Mio pretty regularly, rarely had any issues with them. Does take a while for delivery but never outrageously long. 

Dined in only twice, staff was nice & polite. 

Not much negative to say."}
{"text":"I am a self-proclaimed \"sushi-holic\", and born and raised in Vancouver, BC where the sushi is phenomenal pretty much everywhere. I was told about this restaurant from family and was reluctant due to past sushi experiences in Airdrie at other restaurants. I was and still am in shock at how fantastic this place is. The sashimi is to die for, the specialty rolls are delicious, don't even get me started on the chopped scallop (it is the best I've ever had). They also have great cooked options such as ramen, meat on a rock, and more! The staff is friendly, the atmosphere is modern and cozy, and if you haven't already gotten the hint from this review...the food is great!"}
{"text":"Mio Stone Grill & Sushi is a slightly ostentatious name for this nice little Japanese restaurant in Aidrie.  Granted, my meal was all \"sushi\" and no \"grill\" ... so you may also have to look at other reviews that consider other parts of the menu.

As usual, I ordered miso soup; edemame; red tuna and salmon sashimi; avocado/asparagus rolls; and the Ocean Surprise Rolls (which adds tempura crunch to an otherwise normal roll).

Overall: Good sushi, pleasant staff, no complaints or criticisms at all.  The food came fast and tasted good.  It wasn't particularly crowded, but I attended on a snowy Thursday night in the 'burbs.  

Mio is not a fancy place, but the food is definitely good. The price was very reasonable.  Go if you're in the area."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise when we walked into this gem knowing nothing about it. We were simply looking for a nice sit down meal with our 3 year old. 

The restaurant is very pleasant and trendy with a comfortable feel. The temperature of the restaurant could have been a little bit warmer though as I was chilly. 

Our server was efficient and pleasant. She brought what could only be best described as a plate of tempura yam fries with an incredible sauce lightly sprinkled \"complementary\". It was very good! 

My wife and I ordered the hot stone, a 400C stone to cook on with a side of raw shrimp, beef, lamb, scallops and salmon. You only get 8oz of meat total but with the salad, Miso soup and desert it was a perfect amount for us all for $25 ea. My son had rice. 

The meal was great, the service was great and the atmoshere here was good. I would give it 4.5 out of 5 if I could but I definitely error on the side of a 5."}
{"text":"Love love live this place! A little pricey but worth the $. Food is always great as well as the service."}
{"text":"We thought the presentation of the food was excellent! It looked beautiful, all of the sushi was fresh and delicious. Our waitress was really sweet and did a great job. We were very happy to find this sushi place in Airdrie, we will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Love this place, every time I come to canada.. and Airdrie I always enjoy coming here. Nice place for an after work working dinner."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  Really quick. Service is great. Ordered Lunch box $12.95.. Too many choices and comes with soup and rice."}
{"text":"Great quality food with decent portions. The sashimi was really good. Staff is really friendly!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner on our way out of the city, so we requested take out. They happily obliged and had our sushi ready very quickly. We definitely lucked out with this place, only coming here initially because it was close to our friends house. 

Sushi was VERY good. Super fresh fish. I had my usual salmon nigiri, salmon sashimi and salmon avocado rolls. The rice was very good but the texture was a tad on the harder side in certain places, but definitely not bad. We were definitely left satisfied, and will recommend to our friends who live near by."}
{"text":"One word, amazing! and the customer service is top notch. For those who are new to sushi, the staff will go through each of the items to make sure you have a pleasant experience.  This way there are no surprises when your food comes.  The prices are more than reasonable for what you get with the ingredients are as fresh as they come.  If you are new to sushi or a sushi veteran this is a place you have to experience.  Will be defiantly coming back!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Airdrie!! So glad i discovered this place last summer, we order from here once a month. The spicy bbq pork ramen is incredible and their sushi rolls are the best I've ever had. Super fresh fish and perfect rice :)"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I always seem to have the trouble of deciding where to eat. Today as we sat in the car I flipped through a newspaper and found out about Mio; and am I ever glad I did. This restaurant is a short drive away from Crossiron Mills and perfect for those that hate to look for parking.

The restaurant atmosphere was welcoming and was very cozy. Upon entering, I was hit by a food scent that I couldn't quite place... and still can't... perhaps it was the smell of cooked meat?

Anywhos, aside from that, the menu was easy to navigate and the server was super helpful in explaining the menu. We opted to go for a Dinner on Rock, Grasshopper Roll, and various Sushi and a Maki Roll (Tamago, Ikura, Salmon and Spicy Salmon Roll) all to share.

I felt that they took a fusion approach with their sushi, the tamago was a bit on the softer and wetter side as well. We were quite surprised with the Grasshopper roll; it was quite \"green\" to taste but very addicting!

The star of the supper was of course the \"Dinner on Rock\". This package included soup, salad, rice, dessert, dipping sauces and a variety of 8 oz total meats for our grilling pleasure (Beef, Lamb, Scallop, Prawn, Salmon). The process reminded me of going to Grizzly Paw in Banff, but at a much more affordable price. The process was very enjoyable as it was so hands on and much less intimidating than going to a Korean BBQ. The table ended up covered in butter and meat juices, so make sure you don't leave your phone near the stone grill.

Overall we enjoyed our experience immensely, and left with our clothes filled with the aroma of cooked meat. Would highly recommend for those looking for something different close to the Calgary area."}
{"text":"Such a tasty place. I'm a die hard Globefish fan, but this place gave them a run for their money. I was pleasantly surprised by freshness of tuna sashimi and killer miso soup. I had half raw entrées and cooked, both of which pleased my pallet. Without a doubt, I will consider this place over the trek to Kensington."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi. Clean and yummy. I would highly recommend this spot.  Near airdrie just off the hiway"}
{"text":"Impressive!
Staff was friendly, prompt and accommodating to our infant daughter. The menu is varied and includes such novelties as a \"Grasshopper\" roll; asparagus, avocado, alfalfa, and cucumber. The traditional fair (ie: special scallop) was served in fresh cucumber. Being our first time we had to order enough to taste the overall quality and we were impressed. Snuck in between two fast-food places you will be pleasantly surprised at the slow peaceful feeling this little gem offers. We will return."}
{"text":"After being on the road and eating many overpriced mediocre meals, Neo Stone and Grill was a fantastic surprise!! Our server was very pleasant, friendly and attentive. We started with the gyoza. The dumplings were tender and tasty; very yummy!! For our mains, I had the chicken teriyaki and my husband had the ginger chicken. Both meals were superb!! The food came out quickly, the portions were good sized, and DELICIOUS!! The meal also included a very tasty Miso soup. Upon leaving, the kitchen staff smiled and waved goodbye... a super friendly establishment that appreciates your business!! Next time, we are traveling through the area, we will be returning to Mio!!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! This place was delicious, I'm already dreaming of the next visit. Mio is definitely out of the way if you aren't in the Airdrie/crossiron mall area. The sushi was fresh, fairly good size, and presented very well. The sushi is a little pricer compared to some other places in Calgary but well worth the difference. 

The one thing I would recommend everyone get is the creamy udon! Its was something I would never would have though of getting until my friend forced us to try it. 

The service was excellent and attentive and even for a Tuesday it was pretty full place. Go out and try this place, you won't regret it. Happy munching!"}
{"text":"This is a favorite for my husband and I for sure! We are both sushi lovers and sometimes find it hard to get food sushi!

We live in Red Deer, and frequent the Calgary area often, this is the place we always stop for dinner. 

Always fresh, everything is prepared perfectly, paired amazingly and the service is always great! 

We have a 2 year old daughter and they are always super accommodating to her, plastic cups, utensils and coloring; and tweaking a few dishes to make them more child friendly! 

The tuna tataki is our personal favorite, but the sashimi is always fresh and delish, one of my favorite tempura and the rolls are divine!

I can't say enough good things about this place, if you are in the area, check it out for sure!"}
