{"text":"My family and I have a nice dinner here. We had 2 pastas, a pizza and the Greek salad. The salad was superb!!!!!! The pasta with the red sauce was very very good and the other one with the white sauce we requested was not that great but then again it was so thing not I the menu the sauce requested. The pizza was very good. Great atmosphere overall, nice servers but a little overpriced."}
{"text":"Ok. After travelling all day. We were delighted to have both an exceptional waiter and menu. Highly recommend the shrimp for an appetizer and the risotto for a main dish. Excellent night and a perfect restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is definitely above average.   Especially because your on an island!   Staff is friendly!    Prices are insane!"}
{"text":"It is lunch time and they have only two women trying to clean tables and wait on guests, with over 25 tables you can imagine how hard that is for them. We waited 15 minutes just to be seated, so if you're in a hurry, perhaps skip over to the Tim Hortons across the street instead, it will definitely be cheaper too.  Food however was good, I'd recommend the Club or the Meat Lovers Pizza, which features locally made sausage that was delicious!"}
{"text":"The Caesar salad with delicious,great room service. Excellent dressing not to tarty or bitter just the right texture."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Hilton by the airport and decided to have dinner here one night.   I went up to the front desk and was greeted by the hostess, who was also my waiter. He was a very good waiter and was very sweet. He made sure that everything was going well and that we were enjoying our food.   To eat, I got the butternut squash soup for my appetizer and a chicken stir fry for my entree.   In the mean time, we were given bread by the waiter. He was kind and gave us extra bread because I had such a long day. The bread was a bit hard on the bottom, but otherwise very good.   A few minutes later, my butternut squash soup came out. It was actually really good! It went perfect with the fresh goat cheese on top. While it was not the best I have ever had, it was comparable to the butternut squash soup at Capital Grille.   After that, my chicken stir fry came and smoking hot! It had pieces of Chinese chicken and fresh rice. While I didn't love the chicken, it was nicely breaded and the rice was amazing. Best of all, it was top off with fresh peppers  Finally, for dessert I got carrot cake for dessert. It was nice and fluffy. It was perfectly topped off with cream cheese style frosting.   Altogether, I had a nice, tasty meal at Bliss Restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great food, slowwwww service. Ate two gluten-free dinners here, chose the mushroom risotto & the strawberry beet salad with chicken."}
{"text":"Remarkably average. Ordered a beef teriyaki which was flavorful but the meat was overdone and beyond the requested medium rare. My wife's beet salad was good but the salmon was a small portion. Staff was attentive. Prices were a bit higher than the norm, and I guess I expected more. It was just okay."}
{"text":"Great service, clean, and has a nice ambiance. I was traveling with a cold so couldn't really taste my steak. It's a solid place when you are stuck without a car and by the airport."}
