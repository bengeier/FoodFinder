{"text":"Had the steak dinner, and it was good, and had a cold one to wash it down.  Fries A-OK.  Smoke wafting though the door from the masses of people outside, as well as the distraction was a huge turn off.  I may or may not return, but running the gauntlet of people standing around outside blocking the door or the sidewalk is a pain.  They need to clean up that issue and make sure their patrons are elsewhere other than congregated around the entrance.  Build them a little shelter for smoking, tell them not to stand in the door area, it ruins the experience.  The food is good, but the customers are in need of an education in common courtesy or they will start to lose customers"}

{"text":"Horrible. I'm assuming the only reason Mama Rosa's is still open is because of the locals. If you can get over the high volume of shrewd drunks coming in and out for cigarettes every few minutes then I hope you have luck with the food. 

They have a pretty big menu, but after eating here I would be scared to eat 90% of its listed items. I ordered a chicken caesar wrap and fries and my friend ordered chicken fingers and fries. The food arrived in under 10 minutes but don't let this impress you. The chicken fingers and fries we're both store bought and flash fried and the wrap was made with Kraft dressing and questionable chicken chunks. I could have had that at home for much less money and not been irritated by the smoke smell. The edges of the plates were dirty. 

When my friend came back from the washroom, he told me that the men's room was doubling as a storage room (not unusual) but the spare tables were resting against the wall beside the urinal. How sanitary. 

I couldn't wait to pay my bill and run out of there."}
{"text":"The food is good and the price is right. It's just unfortunate that the front-inside of the place is constantly filled with loud/drunk smokers. It's too bad that these are the regulars"}
