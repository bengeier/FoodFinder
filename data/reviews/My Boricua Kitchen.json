{"text":"I special ordered a dozen pasteles and let me tell you! They were so good I'm glad my husband doesn't eat them so I get them all to myself! Coming from Hawaii this is definitely one of the foods I miss the most! Will definitely be ordering more in the future!!"}
{"text":"I love Puerto Rican food and this is some of the best I have ever had!! It's sooooo good you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I'm not Boricua but I was born in the Bronx and raised in Miami...so I can tell you that My Boricua Kitchen is the real deal. The first time I spotted the truck I was headed into NÃ©kter to grab a smoothie. I saw the Puerto Rican flag on the front of the truck and immediately texted my husband alerting him of my discovery. I couldn't pass up the opportunity to check them out. On that particular afternoon they were closing up so they only had empanadas left. I ordered one chicken, one beef and was throughly impressed with the burst of flavors. I decided to look them up on Facebook and found out that they'd be at D9 the following night for dinner...well guess what?! I couldn't pass up that opportunity either! I showed up with my husband and tribe of children in tow. We tried the tostones rellenos, arroz con grandules, maposteaeo, empanadas, chicken and beef rice bowls, and finished off with flan. Sooooo amazing! The food is most definitely authentic. If you love Caribbean food or just curious about it, you have to check them out!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place after hearing nothing but good things. I was not disappointed. My food was delicious. I had plantain cups filled with beef and topped with sauce. It was beyond good. I can't wait to go back. Service was very good. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars because my husband sandwich was just average. He loved my food though. We both will be going back."}
{"text":"The food smells and taste good. The ladies serving were very polite. The service is good but slow. I think they're still working out their serving/ ordering kinks."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  True Puerto Rican food! Thrilled to have found it!! Mofongo was spectacular. Tostones Relleno were crispy and perfectly cooked. Pastelillos de pollo quite flavorful."}
