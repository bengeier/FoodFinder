{"text":"I really like Tapacubo. It has a nice atmosphere with a large bar in the middle, comfortable booths around the walls, a nice patio on one side and pool on the other (part of the attached Graduate Tempe hotel). 

I have been twice now and had the guacamole and chips both times. The guac is delicious and they give an ample amount. The chips are fine, not great but who cares since the guacamole is so good. The chicken street tacos are amazingly good. In fact, they would be perfect were it not for the very average corn tortillas that seem like you could buy in a grocery store. 

There is a small yet decent beer selection, thankfully not just a bunch of Mexican beers. When you get a beer on tap, they are served in plastic cups - kind of weird but priced pretty well so who cares. 

If you don't want tacos, tortas or a few appetizer-like shared plates, this is not the place for you. The menu is quite limited, but that means the food they do offer is done well in this case. I'd recommend it - much better and unique than most hotel restaurants."}
{"text":"The fish tacos and cochinita tacos are really good. The churros are phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Was a bit disappointed with this place. I expected a full taco spot with lots of yummy options but that wasn't the case. They offer a carne asada burrito but won't do Carne asada tacos?? I asked the waitress what that was about and she said she ASSUMES it's because her chef is concerned with cross contamination?? What the?... Ok. So I order a fish taco, the prices are over inflated for only getting a tortilla a ton of cabbage and a little piece of fish. There are by far so many better options for tacos than this. I will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"We are always happy to come back here, the food is always creative and delicious. And how can you be $2 PBRs? We're happy there in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great sweet corn, margs., and tacos all with great prices and views!! I've already been 3 times and will continue to go back! It's like having a Gallo Blanco in Tempe...without the drive there!!..a plus when you're usually in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Came here a few nights ago, on my way home from work, because I heard it was a good Mexican bar food joint. The service was quick, there were a few patrons at the bar, servers were nice, but the food wasn't worth the money, as it was rather bland. I didn't care for the music or the ambiance. Mostly, someone who I assume to be management kept staring, awkwardly at me almost the entire time... To be honest, I couldn't tell if he wanted to **** me or fight me...

Needless to say, I will not be returning. Don't waste your time here, with Mill so close, you'd be better off spending your time & money at a place that's worth it.

I was speaking about you, Mr. Tolan, but go ahead and keep acting like a smata$$... THAT'S going to make me want to come back"}
{"text":"5 months ago I would have given this place 5 stars. I really loved the atmosphere (great decor and close to Gammage) and the food was great. I still love the chop salad-huge portions, great dressing and an interesting mix of ingredients. 

However, is there a new chef? New management? Not sure what changed. What happened to the Guacamole? I sent family members a text a few months ago raving about the Guac, but tonight it tasted like it was squeezed out of a plastic package and the salsa was really bland. Not worth the $8.50! No hot sauce available for the hubby who likes things spicy! 

Overall, the thing that turned me off the most tonight was the discrepancy between what is advertised on the website versus what is offered at the restaurant. The website advertised under \"events\" for May 27th that it was Walking Taco Wednesday's with Half Priced Wine. When we arrived tonight at 5:45pm (Wednesday) I confirmed with the server that wine was half off for happy hour 3-7pm. She said yes. When we ordered I confirmed with the server that street tacos were $2 she said \"no\" that the tacos were $2 yesterday on Tuesday. Even though I wasn't ordering tacos I inquired because other people in my party were ordering tacos. The discrepancy was only $1 per taco so I really didn't want to push the issue and cause tension among my group. When our food was delivered the server (bless her heart-she was sweet) said she talked to the manager and confirmed that the tacos were not $2 today and apologized. I told her it was fine but she may want to communicate to the managed that the website advertises differently and it should be changed so other patrons are not misled. At the end of the meal she took 15% off our Bill. Initially, I was grateful thinking this was due to the discrepancy issue, however, I recalled from my last meal there a few months ago, that they offer a discount to Gammage patrons that show their show tickets. 

Overall, I didn't feel I should press the issue with the server as she is just doing her job. But if I could offer any words of advice for the management, they should probably check out their website and update it. I left with a full tummy, but a slightly sour taste in my mouth in regards to how the place is managed."}
{"text":"Had a show at Gammage so this was the most convenient location for dinner. But the food was so bland. The shrimp and veggie tacos and rice had no flavor. The salad was ok but a weird mix. The service was good, but I expected more from the food."}
{"text":"Ten months later and the service is just as good as my first visit. The staff was warm and welcoming and very helpful. The F&B manager is doing it right. I will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome new find here in Tempe. Food is 5 stars, same chef as The Normal...very good. Looking forward to seeing this place when the pool here is hopping. Feels more like a spot you'd find in Old Town than Tempe which we liked, very cool design and friendly vibe. $2 PBRs, $3 unreal tacos."}
{"text":"This is a Mexican restaurant that has a full size swimming pool right in the backyard. Girl sitting out there in their bathing suits. We came here before he went to Gammage Theatre for the night and it's totally casual with a mixture of business people and students and super cool."}
{"text":"Wanted  to like this place as it looked like it a nice atmosphere. However I will never go back. The shrimp taco was a flavorless embarrassment. Pretty hard to ruin a quesadilla but they did that as well. Bland and flavorless. Their cocktails were bad as well, again not sure how you ruin that. Moscow mules served in plastic cups! This was one of those places so bad and such a disappointment that you tell your friends about."}
{"text":"My experience here a few weeks ago was a big disappointment. 

My friend and I went before a show at Gammage last week for the 15% off discount with our show tickets - we were so excited to give this place a try! As a lover of all things Mexican food, I can tell you that this place makes a lot of empty promises. 

I had the chicken taco, pulled pork taco, and street rice with a side of guacamole. While the chicken taco was pretty bland, it was definitely the best thing on the plate. Before I ordered the pork taco, I was warned that the mango habanero sauce would be extremely spicy, but I reassured my waitress that I would be fine. Naturally, I was expecting a big bite of flavor after that claim, but was severely disappointed. It tasted like some sort of alcohol didn't cook out completely and the mango habanero didn't have much flavor - just heat. I tried adding the guacamole to give it a lil' flavor, but even that didn't help. Now, the biggest disappointment was the street rice (which shouldn't even be named that). Though the rice was obviously green from cilantro, there was hardly any cilantro flavor AND the rice was undercooked. I actually couldn't even finish eating it. 

Overall, I had really high hopes for this place and hope management sees this post and makes the necessary changes they need in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I noticed one review that commented on the gas pumps as an interesting piece of decor.  \"Tapacubo\" is \"hubcap\" in Spanish.  The light fixtures are made of old hubcaps, or made to look like they are.  In addition, Tapacubo's sign is like an old gas station sign with a gas pump on it.  The restaurant has old gas station garage doors on either side, advertises that its margaritas come out of the gas pumps (leaded or unleaded), but I never saw anything in the gas pumps.  Not sure what the food has to do with a gas station theme, however.

Menu items are street tacos or tortas.  Street tacos were good.  I had the Papi - short rib meat that was very tasty, with sweet bits of pomegranate seeds.  Guacamole was good, but at $8.50, way too expensive.  For one drink each, two tacos and guacamole, after a reasonable tip we were out $42.  Doesn't seem like street taco prices, you know?

I'm a stickler for ambience.  What the heck do TVs all over the place have to do with a gas station? My husband and I sat in a booth with a TV facing us - no one else on that side of the restaurant with us.  Asked if the TV could be turned off.  Well. . . no.  Well. . . that sucks.  Makes the place seem like just another \"sports bar.\" None of the candles were lit, but our server lit ours - when asked.

Had to try it to say that we'd tried it, but we can get street tacos and a drink far cheaper and easily as good or better at a mom and pop place.  And if we want TV, we'll get it to go and drink at home."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is absolutely delicious. Best chopped salad and street tacos I've ever had. Staff are very pleasant. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Graduate Hotel on a recent business trip and had no car, so I went to Tapacubo for drinks after my workday. I wasn't thrilled about not having any options, but I was really pleasantly surprised by this place! The atmosphere was great; it's open to the outside and has combinations of tables and high-tops/bar seats. The pool is right next door so you get a little of that chlorine-summertime smell. They have a decent menu, although I only had chips and salsa/guac, so I can't really comment on the food. The servers were super attentive and even let me charge my phone in the bar area. Justin, the bar manager, is really friendly and knows his drinks! Definitely recommend this place, even if you're not staying in the hotel."}
{"text":"0/10 would not recommend. Came here because we were staying at the Graduate and, hey, this is so conveniently right next to the pool. Ordered the shrimp tacos and smoked chicken tortilla soup, my bf ordered the butter lettuce salad and elote, although he's dairy free so had to get both without cheese & dressing. His food was lackluster, mine was turrible. The tortillas were cold and brittle, as though they had just been pulled out of the bag. The \"sweet chili\" on the shrimp tasted like bottled sauce. The \"soup\" was a mystery mash of some kind of chile. I just don't understand how you mess up tacos."}
{"text":"We ate here three times during a recent stay.  We always had excellent customer service. Though, to be fair, we were always there during very slow times. The food was innovative and fun, very tasty, decent value.  I strongly recommend the tacos and taco salad. I would have liked a better selection of beers but being from the Seattle area, I'm spoiled."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Accommodating with Gammage schedules. Food is meh. Don't order the guacamole with the chips. It tastes more like raw onion than avocado and the quarter cup size doesn't align with the $3 price."}
{"text":"Really bland Mexican food... Not good at all. I was so hopeful because it's a cute place but the food really stinks!"}
{"text":"Went here recently before going to the theatre across the street. I ordered at the bar and the whole experience was enough to make me not return. To start, the bartender they had on was rude and seemed like she did not want to work. I think her name was Maddy, she was blonde. I couldn't get much info on their cocktails so I thought it would be safe to go with what I know. The margarita I ordered was mediocre at best, and the plastic cups they served drinks in look dirty and gross. The tortilla soup they serve was more like a paste with some sourcream slapped on it. I was planning on waiting for some friends, but I closed out early and suggested we meet up at a place on Mill instead of staying here."}
{"text":"The food was below average. Fajitas arrived luke warm on a cold plate with no accompaniments. Soupy salsa. Shrimp tacos were served on paper tasting tortillas with a sauce that amounted to ketchup and sugar. Service was slow. Had to ask twice for water. Overpriced. Only reason for a star is that we parked there and walked to Gammage for a show."}
{"text":"First time here. It is fairly new, in the Graduate hotel. The name means hubcap, according  to Google.  The roll up garage doors in nice weather is cool and the toolbox  lamps are interesting!  The iced tea is so-so, not the best. So, the decor is a cute theme, some inexpensive things you could do at home. Across the street from ASUGAMMAGE,  that is why I am here! I would like to say that the bartender was very friendly and took care of us!! I will try it again for the tacos or indIan fry bread!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place, attached to a gracefully aging motel and across the street from the ASU Campus. The food is okay, typical bar Mexican food. The ambience is great, there is a pool out back, all things considered seems solid enough for what it is. That being a gin mill that serves food and seems to be hopping pretty hard up Friday night, across the street from a college that probably has more drunk 21 year olds per capita in terms of density of anywhere in the United States between September and June."}
{"text":"It's a small place but it has a nice patio and rooftop bar. 

Very small menu, but a nice for a light lunch or dinner. Definitely order the guacamole."}
{"text":"Not the very BEST, but pretty darn good!!  (I still Gallo Blanco).  
I had the short ribs taco, the pork taco and the side of corn (which comes in a bowl).  The tacos were delicious if a bit greasy.  I ate every bite!  The meat was fall-apart tender and nicely seasoned.  The view to the pool provided nice relaxing atmosphere.  The corn is DELICIOUS!!  Definitely a young person's place (so near ASU), but everyone was very friendly to us older folks (ranging in age from 40's to mid-50's).  Would I come back again?  I think definitely!"}
{"text":"Yummy tacos, local beer selection & fun staff. We'll be back just to eat very soon. The day we were here there were lots of everyone. There were couples dressed up for a night at Gammage, students studying on the patio & professors munching & chatting. Very fun atmosphere & decor. Definitely looking forward to an evening on the large patio now that the weather is agreeable."}
{"text":"Tapacubo is sooo laid back! They have awesome staff, (friendly bartenders) good food with great prices!! The only thing that would be rad is if they experiment with the music they play. Not everyone wants to hear top/radio hits. Make a Shannon and The Clams radio. It'll bring more people in."}
{"text":"The shrimp and chicken tacos were great! I don't like that you have to pay 6 bucks for chips and salsa. The drinks are fresh and different which is great. I think they need to get different sides and comfortable bar stools and this place would be perfect!"}
{"text":"yelp removed my previous review saying that they thought I'd left it on the wrong businesses page, but no, this review is meant for Tapacubo, not some other business. So here it is again.

I came to this bar for the two dollar beers and I saw a beer on tap that I had never tried before. I asked to have a taste of a beer I had never tried before and the bartender was extremely rude. He asked me if I was kidding for asking for a taste because the beers were only two dollars. Regardless of the price of the beer, I wanted to know whether I enjoyed it, which isn't too much to ask for. The bartender chose not to serve me after I asked for a taste and this kind of service deserves a poor review."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Sweet corn is amazing. However, it took an hour to get our food and drinks are overpriced."}
{"text":"Just tried this place and it was DELICIOUS! I'm always looking for new local places to try out tacos. Being Spanish, I'm extremely picky about my \"Mexican food\". The food was absolutely amazing along with the staff. The manager made sure we had a great experience and it was just over all a great time. My new favorite spot for sure."}
{"text":"This place has spent too much money on its decor and too little on the menu. You get served your beer in PLASTIC cups. After seeing the menu i decided to have chips and salsa in order to go eat somewhere else after. Salsa was like water,no flavor. although the place was empty the staff seemed uninterested. Wont be back"}
{"text":"Customer service here is a joke. Slow, inattentive, and a laughably small \"neat\" pour. My friend got food poisoning here on his first visit and I was spoken to as if I was a drunk college student rather than a 35-year-old spending his hard-earned money with half a dozen friends at the bar. And by the restaurant manager, of all people. She said to my friends as I walked away, \"Well HE's obviously been drinking.\" I'd had only one beer prior. \"Well he must be like this all the time.\" Actually, no, it takes a lot to piss me off.

When I went out of my way to explain the course of events to the GM the next day, she admitted that the neat pour should have been 2oz and not 1.5oz, and all that was offered to me as a consolation was, \"That seems out of character for her, I'll speak with her about it.\"

Um, thanks? Yeah, never again."}
{"text":"Food was good but average here. Good for a quick bite. Hubby had burger and I wanted carnitas tacos. They were out! He recommended shrimp tacos so I said ok. The tacos were actually pretty tasty and had lots of shrimp too.  Burger was tasty hubby said.. charbroiled."}
{"text":"Came here for HH because we were staying at the hotel and the rooftop bar was closed. HH is 3-6PM, gets you a buck off apps and drinks. We tried a drink (El Presidente?), which was similar to a Moscow Mule and their smoked chicken tortilla soup, which was more of a stew than any tortilla soup I've encountered and somehow came out within three minutes of ordering. Bartender was attentive, patio available with heaters."}
{"text":"Ordered a dirty vodka martini and received it on rocks in plastic rocks glass. And was only offered olives after. I guess it's fine - and it tasted good - but the experience of a martini just isn't the same with ice and straws. I ditched the straws in the interest of not downing it too fast. I thought \"up\" was the default but not here so request it. Bar tender was nice, fast and attentive and the drink was still tasty. Bar itself is ok. Views \"motel pool\" and ASU on either side."}
{"text":"Miserable service. Place was almost empty, and after our drinks were served, they didn't even come back. After 20 minutes we finally went to find them to cash out. This isn't even considering the prices are ridiculous. $9 for two tiny tacos and $13 for the smallest margarita I've ever seen. $4 for dried out hard chips and (decent) salsa."}
{"text":"Maybe it was just us, but my friend and I came here expecting food that compared to The Normal diner's food (the sister restaurant) and were very disappointed. The tacos were drowned in sauce and the tortillas were soaked through with it as well. The chips and salsa came with two tiny cups of salsa, and to top it off the lemon and cilantro in the street rice was overpowering. Defintely more like bar food to have whilst drinking. I wouldn't recommend going for just the food."}
{"text":"Let's just start off by saying they have 2 happy hours with great taco and drink specials! Simple yet yummy! Guacamole comes with 2 salsas and chips- yum! Plus the margaritas and tequila options will keep me coming back! Bonus if you are staying at The Graduate hotel, where you can drink and eat poolside!"}
{"text":"Lackluster food at best. Came here to grab a quick bite to eat and drink before Hamilton across the way at Gammage. They should staff a bit more for show nights. We sat at the bar and service was slow but there was only one girl working behind the bar and she was busting her butt so I don't hold her accountable. They were just understaffed during the pre show rush. Got chips and salsa to start and the chips were a bit too greasy but still good for your typical taco joint chip. The salsa on the other hand leaves much to be desired. Zero taste, heat or spice to it and very runny and watered down. We ordered the grilled chicken quesadilla and that too had subpar flavor to it. Not too much chicken in, but in a weird way, it was still filling and nicely sized. The strawberry margarita was actually very good though. So they've at least got the drinks going for them. If you want a quick, cheapish bite to eat before the show it's doable (they also give a discount if you are going to see a show so that's a plus). Or if you want some good drinks (and a variety on tap, cans, and bottles) it's good for that."}
{"text":"We grabbed a quick bite prior to a performance at Gammage. Great atmosphere and the quesadilla app. was good! Food came out quickly. Would come again to try more of the menu and drinks!"}
{"text":"The only thing going for this place is you can have a cocktail by the pool. A very over priced cocktail. 
The food was horrible. Shrimp thrown on a tortilla and covered in a boat load of crappy chili sauce does not make a good taco. 
The restaurant has a cool vibe and I really wanted to like this place. 
Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for some drinks, guac, salsa, and chips before seeing If/Then The Musical and it was the perfect pre-show spot! It is connected to The Graduate hotel. We were able to park there and then just walk across the street to see the show when we were finished dining. The best part, they give a discount to show attendees! The guac and salsas were fresh and delish. We will definitely be back before our next broadway production at Gammage! P.S. I recommend that you walk through the lobby of The Graduate hotel on your way in or out! It is SUPER retro and cool. :) I would love to plan a staycation here on the night of a football game or a special occasion!"}
{"text":"They're great for lunch. But don't is another matter. There is no way of knowing when they are open. Once we got there at 7pm on Friday and the kitchen was already closed because they were short handed. Next time we called and were told it was going to be open for another hour. When we showed up there in 10 minutes at 8:30, once again the kitchen was closed. Pretty incredible."}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant at 8:30 on a cool November Saturday night. Our previous dinner here was very pleasant. Tonight there were only two customers inside the bar which was quite cold. My wife asked the waitress if she could close the doors. She asked the manager who told her the other couple wanted to doors open. As we left without ordering, I told him he won and he smiled. 
He must be very proud that he runs the only empty bar in Tempe. 
We'll never be back. 
As a footnote, we went next door to the Normal Diner and had a pleasant experience and the hotel desk manager was very sympathetic."}
{"text":"Our waiter was great! I would give him 5 stars. The food is super over priced  2 drinks (we were given happy hour prices$1 off) the 2 plates we got only came with 2 tacos $8/plate no sides. Elotes was one the sides we got. It was $4 for half an ear of corn! The other side we ordered were the refried black beans also $4 but a good amount and they were pretty good. We also got the poblano and artichoke dip...$12 small portion for $12 but the waiter also gave us salsa to try so that was nice. Tacos, Eehh. Nothing to go back for. They were good. Not great and not for that price."}
{"text":"I've been here about three times total. The first two times were to meet friends for drinks only which were great. I have no qualms about their bar. Today was the first time I came to eat. I arrived with my husband and two friends. I was on a time crunch since I had to get back to work in 40 minutes but the other three had more time to spare. I made my waitress aware of that and that I would need a to go box when the meal arrived so I could make a quick exit. I am fully aware that I am a really picky eater. I ordered a taco salad which listed that it came with beans, guacamole, and sour cream. When I ordered it,  I asked for the salad with the ground beef, no sour cream, no beans, and guacamole on the side. About five minutes before I had to leave I received my salad with no to go box, no beef, and olives. First off, if you're going to put a description of what's in the salad, why don't you put EVERYTHING? If I had known there were going to be olives, I would've asked for no olives. Then I had to ask for the beef again which left me asking my husband to bring the meal into me at work. That was the end of my personal experience inside the restaurant. When he brought it to me, he proceeded to tell me when there were two cups of beef. When the first one was brought out, the meat barely covered the bottom of the cup. He then told the waitress that was not acceptable for that size of a salad. She said she could bring another one out but it would be 15 minutes. When I finally did get to eat it (about an hour later) I was severely disappointed. Here's the total breakdown: five minutes picking out olives, 1 minute putting out flavorless beef, two minutes eating a soggy salad with an even soggier shell (I get it, it was an hour later, that can't be helped), one minute to really say that salad was crap, 20 seconds to walk to the trash can and throw 3/4th of the salad away. I honestly wish I took the extra steps and walked to Chipotle."}
{"text":"We stopped in one Sunday afternoon after brunch at the Normal Diner.  They did a great job renovating the hotel and Tapacubo has a beautiful bar overlooking the hotel's pool.  I enjoyed the seasonal fruit collins - it was so dangerously good.  I'll definitely be back before a show at the Gammage."}
{"text":"Fun place in a great area. They changed the menu, the food used to be great, now it's just good. Decent variety or Mexican. We bring our toddler, it is a hotel bar restaurant, I've seen kids in there plenty, but at earlier hours. Not sure the vibe late night."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday, after having multiple great experiences at this hotels other restaurant, the Normal diner.

I sat at the bar and received great service from the two bartenders working. The leaded margarita was delicious but, it was the food that insures me to write this review. The Papi taco is a must have! If your in the mood for something more filling, both the pollo torts and the cubano are outstanding. One of the best cubano sandwiches I've ever had. 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love the tacos here! Once you order your food comes out quickly but is still very fresh. Yummy chips and salsa too :) the tacos are a little overpriced, but not too bad. I loved the atmosphere too, it's very open and right next to the pool at The Graduate."}
{"text":"Pros: The Papi and Conchintia tacos, cubano sandwich, and location.

Cons: Salsa was flavorless, micheladas aren't prepared well, service is slow, I like free chips and salsa (what, don't judge).

I expected more from this new restaurant, but it is new. I'm sure the business has a few kinks to work out. I believe the gentleman that greeted us halfway through dinner was the manager? It was a two word conversation. I would expect a bit more friendliness, especially on a Saturday at 9:00pm when there are a total of six people in the restaurant. 

The tacos are good! I would maybe get take-out for the tacos."}
{"text":"Food was all right, the steak on the nachos was good, the corn on the cob was corn in a bowl, service was friendly but weak. If you are looking for that new cool neighborhood Mexican joint this isn't it. If you are not in a hurry, need some munchies and want to watch a game this will work."}
{"text":"Service was really good but the food was pretty basic. The shrimp tacos looked like they were made with frozen pre-cooked shrimp and they were warm at best. \"The Burger\" was presented pretty horribly and was $13 for just the burger, no fries or a side. I was also expecting lettuce or tomato on the burger but the only toppings were for fried onions and bacon and some little pieces of green chili. The pretzel bun was sopping wet, I couldn't stomach it so I just ate the burger. 
The food here use to be awesome. With all different types of sides. It seems like it's just gotten more expensive and the food has gotten worse."}
{"text":"Outstanding! The food that is, the staff not so much. Great prices on both food & drinks. Their Cubano Torta is to die for!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and the food is only okay (the salsa is basically water). The wait staff, particularly a short haired blonde girl who waited on our party was so rude to everyone from the moment we showed up. We have been here was a group many times for work events and the place is always empty and yet they treat us as if they're put out. With the food only being okay and the staff being poor, it's not really worth it to go here unless you're really desperate for a place walking distance from campus."}
{"text":"To drink and watch a game 
To go eat  Meh 
Monday .50c wings and Trivia with prizes for 1st 2nd 3rd place starting at 7pm
Thursday 2x1 Tacos  Starting at 7pm"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but the portions are small. It's a typical hotel prices and $6 for chips and salsa! That's crazy. The tacos are good and so is the Spanish rice. The atmosphere is fun and funky. I also like that you can visit the pool while you eat. It's a fun place that have a cool spin on street tacos."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend this restaurant unless you have an entire afternoon of nothing planned.  The chips and salsa we ordered came out 15minutes after we ordered them and that was only after we followed up asking how much longer they should take. I ordered the veggie taco which came out 20minutes later and had a cube of chicken inside of it. I also ordered the sweet corn side but was told this would be at least 30minutes because it's shaved fresh from cob so I got rice instead.  Keep in mind this was 6:30pm on a Tuesday and the place was dead. Overall very disappointed with my experience."}
{"text":"This place is a joke....... Food sucks service sucks..... never again.....we're invisible sitting at the bar. We have to ask for everything. Salsa taste like water. We mentioned it and they said we know......NICE."}
{"text":"Food was so tasty!! The service couldn't have been better!! The place is really nice inside, the guacamole and salsa was so delish!!
The best server ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday to watch the FIFA game.  The place is located inside The Graduate Hotel and from what I gather it was pretty dead.  

I started by ordering some Happy Hour specials; chips and salsa and a beer.  For my entree I went for some tacos; pork shoulders and the chicken tacos.  I thought the chips and salsa was decent at best.  I would rather have fresh made chips and salsa; plus the salsa had a weird strong vinegar-like taste; both red and green.  The pork shoulder tacos were a tad bit cold my partner and I thought plus could use a little more kick and spice.  The thing I like about it is the pickled onions giving it some texture.  My chicken tacos was probably my favorite of the night.  I love avocados, but again would want some more spice to it and also more cabbage slaw for more texture. 

In the end, Tapacubo was a nice place to visit and chill for drinks.  I didn't really care for the food and thought the chips and salsa at least be complimentary.  No Taco Tuesday!? - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came to have dinner with my crew and the food was delicious! The Chorizo tacos are a killer. The margaritas are great. Our server Rick was knowledgeable about the menu, super welcoming and friendly! Really looking forward to coming here again and hopefully being able to dine with Rick!"}
{"text":"The drinks were great, didn't try the food. Nice view of ASU, especially at sunset! Seems like it would have a nice vibe if it were a little busier, but it was pretty empty when we were there. Nicole was our server, and she was fabulous!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting and I was pretty pleased with our experience.  The cocktail I ordered was delicious and they had a pretty good selection of craft beer. The carnitas tacos were huge and tasty (loved the habanero mango salsa), but the meat was a little dry. The limes were also super dry. Overall the meal hit the spot. I'll be back to try the other varieties."}
{"text":"For a hotel restaurant, Tapacubo is above average. While the food is far from authentic Mexican, there's plenty of good tasting grub to fill up on - the queso nachos & salads being stand-out items (yes, the salads were more exciting than the tacos!) Excited to see \"elote\" as a side dish, though theirs is non-traditional: more like creamed corn in a big bowl. Still tasty, just not really elote. 

The \"poolside cantina\" vibe is chill, hip, and breezy. Bonus, it's affordable! Lunch special is 2 tacos & a side for $9, or 3 tacos & a side for $11. Even the cocktails are a reasonable at $8. Of course, the tacos are tiny, and the meat versions are much tastier than the vegetarian options - they were just weirdly seasoned and skimpy. 

Super fun spot for a casual group lunch, drinks by the pool, or even getting some work done with a side of nachos. Well done, Graduate Hotel!"}
{"text":"Great service, location, and atmosphere. The wait staff was very helpful. I love how it's connected to the pool of the Graduate.

The tacos were really impressive. The guac is great. I also had a horchata slushee that can be served with or without alcohol. I think all horchatas should be served in slushee form now."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Graduate hotel for our daughters graduation and thought it would be fun to have drinks and tacos at the pool bar (Tapacubo)
Very poor food and probably the rudest bartenders I've ever meet. It was clear that they hated their jobs and life it to short for them to be so miserable and for our group of 20 to revisit this place......"}
{"text":"I stopped here for happy hour last night. The drink and food deals were good ($1 off beer, wine, cocktails and appetizers), and the bartender, Rick, was super nice and made some great drinks. The food was just OK. I ordered chicken tortilla soup, and they weren't stingy with the chicken, but the chicken was overcooked. I also had the elote, and again, it was OK. It's hard to screw up corn with mayo and spices. The best part of the place is the decor (gas pumps behind the bar, chandeliers made from hubcaps, pesos in the bar), with Rick's service being a close second. I wouldn't come back for the food, though."}
{"text":"Called ahead to see if they had a roof top bar and to see what happy hour specials they had.  We were a large group meeting for drinks.  Well, no roof top bar but on the 4th floor you can take your drinks up just no bar service.  Not a bad view.  No happy hour specials but they had $4 beers & $3 tacos...everything else was a little pricey.  They had a decent selection on tap, our server was little clueless, the patio was kind of small, all in all nothing special.  

So now we are ready to leave and our friends rode their bikes to Tapacubo and when we were ready to leave one of the bikes was STOLEN.  The bike rakes were on the side of building in the parking lot.  NO CAMERAS someone came and cut the cable and took off with one of the bikes.  Our friends have been calling the hotel for a week to speak to the manager and not return phone calls.  

It's safe to say.....do not ride your bike here and we will never be back."}
{"text":"Great tacos! I had both the Papi and the achiote chicken...both super good! My friend also ordered the churros and they were amazing! Pleasantly surprised :)"}
{"text":"A group of friends and I visited Tapacubo over the weekend.  We wanted to grab drinks and a bite to eat before heading over to see a show at Gammage.  The drinks were all right, although the rooftop does not have a full bar.  The view was really nice, especially at sunset.  However, the food was a total letdown.  I had a chicken and a short rib taco and both were flavorless and greasy.  I was hungry and I didn't even want to finish them.  My boyfriend had the fundido sliders which were also lacking flavor.  Everyone else said their meal was mediocre at best.  The churros were pretty good for dessert, but that was the only thing I tried that was worth eating.  This place is ok to have a beer or two and enjoy the view, but eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Simply the BEST tacos I've ever had in the US. The chicken tacos are the best tacos I've ever eaten ANYWHERE! Ceviche is an absolute must have. A little different than the classic leche de tigre style with the addition of coconut milk, but all the more tasty and exciting for it. Service was a little slow, but food came out quickly. Hot, fresh, delicious. Except for the cerviche, of course . Would have given 5+ stars except for the service. Not bad, just a little off. They are new, so I'm sure it will get better. We will absolutely be back!! Update!! Came back after the show and service is SPECTACULAR! Night shift has it going on. Sitting outside people watching and drinking server recommended ($4!) shots. Huge pours! Awesomesauce. Nicole Rocks!  Coming back soon!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The menu only has about 10 items. A few tacos and tortas to choose from, chips, salsa etc. Had a drink some tacos and guac and it was good! Would definitely come back for some tacos another day!"}
{"text":"Their food and drinks are fine--nothing fantastic, but it's not bad. Their service, however is slow, inefficient, and verging on rude. They seem to be massively understaffed, so I guess I'd be mad, too. 

If you're on a timeline or are very hungry go somewhere else. If you want to hang out, watch a game, and aren't in a hurry this place would probably be fine if you're down for mediocre food. 

Also, their drink names are verging on racist."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Graduate Hotel this past weekend and had a chance to finally check out Tapacubo. The staff was really friendly and able to make one of my favorite drinks when at a mexican restaurant. The michelada packed a lot of flavor and some heat too! I also tried the carne asada torta with their house chips and it was delicious. I will be returning here often!"}
{"text":"Tacos were small and not exceptionally flavorful. I ordered 2 chicken and 2 fish. I guess I expected more from Arizona because in Chicago 2 tacos would have hit the spot. This left me still hungry. I also had a side of street corn.  There was something in it other than corn, mayo, and spices. It's a street food. It does not need to be sexy-d up. I hate when places do that. In Chicago it's on the cob...this was in a bowl *insert eyeroll*"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Chicken tortilla soup was essentially canned tomato sauce with chunks of chicken and a dollop of sour cream. Mexicali Caesar salad was bland. We also had the chicken tacos that were marginal. Nice staff and convenient location to Gammage. I'm sure the beer is good, just avoid the food."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, just not a place I'll make an effort to go back to. It seems like it'd be good to eat lunch and drinks by the pool, but if you're going there for dinner, atmosphere and food was underwhelming. I got a lavender lemon rum drink which was pretty good and refreshing. I ordered \"grilled\" chicken tacos but chicken was shredded and covered in a chili sauce resembling sloppy joes. Not what I was expecting when it said grilled chicken and the tacos were plain tasting. Needed more sour cream sauce."}
{"text":"Over priced and horrible taste. $11 for 2 small tacos and $12 for an \"appetizer portioned\" fajita plate. The food had no flavor and was cold. The tortillas were hard. The meal gave me bad heartburn. My boyfriend rarely complains about food and he concluded it was just a bad experience. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great place to have a couple cheap drinks. Tacos were good too. Fun atmosphere and conveniently located."}
{"text":"I'm an ASU Tempe student and just barely heard about Tapacubo during a search for something new in Tempe. Went with a friend for lunch during the week not too long ago and was thoroughly impressed. There wasn't a single other customer when we went in, but others joined us every once in a while during our meal. The personnel were friendly and seemed knowledgeable.

As others have noted, the menu is fairly short, however the selections were sufficient. The prices were average, probably a good deal for the quality of the food. My friend and I each got two tacos, different flavors. I enjoyed the chicken taco, but was most impressed by the \"El Papi\" (new favorite). You DO have to enter the hotel to enter the restaurant.

The place had a sort of Route 66 gas station vibe going on that almost seemed like a modern street taco stop in LA. Loved the food and the atmosphere. I will definitely be coming back here as soon as possible."}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm in the MBA program at ASU and we occassionaly have happy hours here. Everything on the menu is good--I usually get street tacos and the brown bag churros which are AMAZING! I've brought my dog to the patio a few times and it worked out well. Good bloody mary's too :) They staff was very accomodating and pleasant."}
{"text":"It was not very busy when we first arrived around 7pm but it slowly picked up over the course of our meal. The ambiance of the place is pretty cool and if it were in a better location it would make for a nice hang out/bar spot.

We were seated promptly and order chips with salsa and guacamole which came out very quickly. I had the short rib and pork taco. The pork was ok and the short rib was better. My girlfriend had a fish taco and veggie taco. She was happy with the fish, not the best she ever had but good. The veggie was a raw taco with kale and butternut squash. It might have been better if it were sautéed. 

The parking lot is kind of strange. It is one way that leads to a dead end. When you leave you have to back out and drive the wrong way."}
{"text":"Arrived early to meet two friends here for happy hour, but Tapacubo doesn't offer happy hour.  The one-page food menu listed delicious-sounding items with great prices, though, so I decided to stay.  I initially had trouble finding a way to get into the restaurant after parking at The Normal's parking lot- wasn't able to locate the patio entrance, so I decided to try The Graduate's hotel entrance and found my way in from there.  The reason I couldn't find the patio entrance from the outside was because it was latched shut.

Walked past the hotel's pool (which reminded me of The Saguaro's pool setup) on my left and walked around the central bar and sat down so that I could look out into the patio.  Noticed the beautiful old gold coins on the counter set in a honeycomb pattern, which mirrored the honeycomb wallpapering at The Normal (and later on, I was able to check out Tapacubo's women's restroom to find that there's honeycomb wallpaper there, too!).  I love honeycomb pattern, so I was delighted.  There was a flatscreen TV facing me on this side of the bar, so I\"m assuming that the other side had one, too.  The bar is flanked by two old pumps (gas?)- not something you usually see in a bar, so they were nice touches.  I also noticed that the barstools are different from the ones depicted on Tapacubo's website, which were very welcome, indeed!  These had backings, plus comfy, if I recall correctly, padded seats.  Tapacubo's a small restaurant, but with an intimate ambience.

To drink, I ordered the Macua, which consisted of Matusalem rum, guava juice, fresh lemon juice, and simple syrup. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tapacubo-tempe?select=blVnRlCN9aisxpYAxcpX2w#blVnRlCN9aisxpYAxcpX2w  Light, not too sweet, tart, and very refreshing!  I'd order it again.   For my mains, I ordered the Cochinita taco ($3) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tapacubo-tempe?select=blVnRlCN9aisxpYAxcpX2w#3EYnivdyyjPmiWB1nR3fAA and Pollo torta ($8.50). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tapacubo-tempe?select=J5xjybRajxB9EYlkXrFYsw#J5xjybRajxB9EYlkXrFYsw  The menu stated that the tacos come on either corn or flour tortillas, so I specifically requested for flour tortillas, because I was allergic to corn.  I took one bite and noticed there was a corn texture and taste to it, and I turned to my friend to ask him if he thought it was corn, and he said it looked like flour, but felt thick like corn.  I quickly spat out what I could and ran to the restroom (which is how I noticed that it had honeycomb-patterend wallpapering).  When I returned, our server Tiffany said that it was a flour tortilla, but because she had touched my food, she went ahead and asked for another one.  The second one was definitely flour, because it was thinner, more pliable, and softer.  I found the juicy pork to be a little too sweet for my taste, but I appreciated its spicy flavor.  Wish I could've eaten more of the sautéed onions in this dish (onion intolerance), as they looked and felt perfectly cooked.  The side of pickled veggies (jalapeños, carrots, and perhaps cabbage) was a nice touch!  I'd try other tacos next time.  The pollo torta contained well-seasoned chicken, lettuce, cheese (cotija?), and chipotle mayo.  Very tasty, but the chicken component was, as my friend described it, \"indistinct.\"  You could've told me it was beef in there, and I would've believed you.  Still tasty, though.  I thought that the filling was a little sparse.  Definitely more bread to this pressed sandwich than I'd wanted, but the crunch factor made my mouth happy.  Homemade chips were very good!  Crispy and light, perfectly salted, and not greasy- perfect!

For dessert, I had the Brown bag churros, which came with salted caramel sauce.  I noticed that the pastry was on the counter not by sight, but by scent-- it smelled wonderful! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tapacubo-tempe?select=blVnRlCN9aisxpYAxcpX2w#j6McW80vpbrn0LOXH7d5ig  The textures of the churros were terrific-- fried exterior with deep grooves that were filled with sugar (unfortunately, there was too much sugar!), and the churro pieces were very pleasant to break into pieces, as I shared them with friends.  Dipping them into the salted caramel wasn't easy, as the grooves were overloaded with sugar and thus had no more room for the delicious silken caramel.  So, we just spooned the caramel into our mouths.  Problem solved.  Yeah, this is worth ordering again, but definitely with less sugar next time.

Friendly staff.  When we asked whom I assumed was a manager for possible live music in the area (since Yelp app wasn't of much help), she said she was a new transplant and would ask around.  We told her we'd try the front desk reps, who also didn't know of any places nearby, and it was a pleasant surprise to have one of the bar guests approach us with suggestions he found with his smartphone.  Very sweet of him, and of the manager.  Kudos!"}
{"text":"Been here many times and it never disappoints! 
If you're looking for some great food and an awesome happy hour, this is the place to go! Two dollar tacos after 9pm and a great selection of drinks as well. House margarita is highly recommended. For food, try the steak nachos! And definitely don't skip dessert! The brown bag churros are out of this world. 
On top of everything, their staff is friendly and provides amazing service. This is definitely the place to be in Tempe."}
{"text":"Overpriced, Gross margaritas - nasty surgery mix gives the drink a bad name. All of the dishes are cold in the center, like they were premade and reheated by order. The idea of this restaurant is great, but boil it down and you're getting frozen food and margarita mix for premium prices. This place needs a hot kitchen and a mixologist. Also, the debit machine was down during our last two hour visit, so was the ATM in the lobby, so I had to drive down the street (trust me, you couldn't get drunk off of a lifetime of their margaritas) and pull cash from chase bank to settle my bill and *TIP* my teenage waiter. But hey, if you like eating lunch in a museum of gas station \"up-cycle\", this is the joint for you. 

Pool's fun."}
{"text":"Food was way below par. No flavor whatesover in salsa.  Tortilla soup was like eating from a jar of Prego.   Only redeeming feature was margarita and walking distance to Gammage.  Otherwise eat before you come here"}
{"text":"Tapacubo (located at the bottom of the Graduate Tempe hotel) has a nice vibe to it. There is an expansive bar indoors with plenty of seating, and booths surrounding the bar for additional seating for larger groups. From the inside you have a view of the small outdoor pool and the outdoor patio. It is light, bright and airy. 

The menu was simple: apps, salad, tortas or tacos, I was a little disappointed with the limited options but again, it is in a hotel. I will say the salad I had was delicious, it was almost their version of a chopped salad (lettuce, tomato, picked onion, quinoa, corn, blueberries and delicious smoked chicken). 

The drinks were reasonably priced and although the food took a while the server more than made up for it."}
{"text":"Sensational food and margaritas, especially the steak nachos. Be sure to end with churros with caramel sauce. I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I thought the menu, though limited, looked stupidly awesome! Had the ahi ceviche which was very good, served with plantain chips. Street tacos are great, too. Don't usually go veggie, but this veg taco was extremely good. Chatted with mgr about future plans and look forward to watching this place grow!"}
{"text":"I stayed at the hotel 3 days for a business trip. The sponsor covered my lodging and meals, forcing me to eat the free meals at the Normal and Tapacubo. Each meal was death. This is an overall review of 8 meals. 

The Normal: watery salsa, eggs not fully cooked, parfait warm and watery, granola stale, bacon raw, flavorless diner coffee, toast burnt to a crisp on one side, the hash pork shoulder way drier than this godforsaken desert wasteland. Bring a good book if you come here, it'll be 30 minutes before you'll get water of place an order, then another 30 to get food. Everything overpriced

Tapacubo: veggie flautas were absolute death....I gagged...the veggies were unidentifiable, the steak in the tacos and tortas have the texture of a pencil eraser, salsa watery and flavorless, quesadilla was mediocre but cold, the small cup of guacamole was okay, but not good enough to be 8.50. Service terrible. I reached over the bar counter to refill my own water. 

Graduate Tempe: when attempting to check in, they said room would be ready shortly. Translated, that means take a two hour nap on the lobby couch. Sink didn't drain properly. Cable was out. 

Save yourself....keep driving."}
{"text":"We tried to eat here as we are patrons of the hotel. We were told that the kitchen closes at 10pm, but when we went for food at 8:30pm they had closed the kitchen. We picked the hotel so we didn't have to leave to eat. Be warned that they close when they feel like it."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Full of flavor. The staff was very attentive and friendly. Definitely recommend this place whether you're staying at the hotel or even a local. The pool is right off the bar and very relaxing..."}
{"text":"Stopped by for quick drinks with friends before a show at Gammage. I ordered the \"Sparkling Paloma\" ($6) and it was light and refreshing. They had a decent draft list but I would say the wine by the glass was pretty expensive for what it is. Service was fine. Not a bad stop if you're looking for something quick close to campus or Gammage. Hope to come back to try food sometime."}
{"text":"I used to work at the diner next door, so I've been to this bar a few times. Here are my thoughts: 

It's really small compared to a lot of bars around. I'm not a fan of the pretentious atmosphere. It's part of the hotel, if that says anything. 

The music is nothing great. You can find better at lounges near by. Mill is literally down the street with much better options, even for food!!

And last but not least, the management sucks. The manager of Tapacubo (Tolan Farris) is one of the worst most arrogant people I've met. I mostly say this due to the fact that I've heard him say some awful things about customers for no reason. He's unprofessional and inappropriate. 

Honestly, don't spend your money there, especially with the current management. There are so many better options in the area! Explore and find businesses that will treat you with respect and not bad mouth you behind your back."}
{"text":"Ate here while waiting for musical to start at Gammage. Food was good, presentation was great. Got chicken tacos with corn."}
{"text":"One of my girlfriends was celebrating her birthday and wanted tacos. 
I went to my trusty Yelp app and gave her a few options, of which she selected Tapacubo. I was super excited to try it out because I have driven by the Graduate many times and it looks really interesting on the outside and never knew a cute hipster taco place was part of the complex. 

We weren't sure about seating, so birthday girl set a reservation for our group. Surprisingly it was dead there during dinner time(!!) and we didn't really need it. Nice touch anyway to partition part of the place for us, give her prickly pear sorbet, and play a Happy Birthday song from Spotify. 

It took maybe 20 minutes for all of us to arrive, and by that point I think the waiter/bartender had swung by once? to greet us and offer water. That kind of set the mood for the service, unfortunately. She was nice, but the service was just sucky. Rarely came by to check on us, had to request a few times just to get water refills, and it took forever for her to get her attention to come by and take our drink + dinner order.  One friend ordered chips + salsa and it appears the gal just plain forgot about bringing those out. 

Everyone but myself ordered tacos, I just wasn't feeling it. They looked good and everyone liked them, but the consensus was there should be another option besides corn tortillas. Especially for fajitas! The fries are great though [crazy for a taco stand place]. My butter lettuce salad was good, just overpriced. I paid $12 for it, +$3 adding chicken. It was worth in total probably $10, and it was difficult to eat on the plate... how about a bowl for salads?I also ordered the Desert Blues drink and it was good, but nothing too memorable about it."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Ended up leaving after our first round because we didn't get any service. When we went to close out the bartender couldn't find my credit card and insisted she had given it back to me. When she finally found it, she wasn't apologetic or courteous at all. Don't come here."}
{"text":"Not sure where to start on this one.  

We came in here a few weeks ago for some dinner before catching our show over at Gammage.  When we got there, there were not many people there but the place looked pretty cool so I was excited to check it out.  We were there with another couple who were also headed to the show.

Our server was very friendly and certainly did her best to keep up with everything so I am not sure where the disconnect is as far as management or the kitchen.  The place started to fill up and it was clear that she was the only server for the entire place which made for a longer wait time for our checks at the end of the meal.  Apparently her manager was behind the bar working so I don't know who messed up the scheduling that night.

Let's move on to the food.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't great.  We tried a few of the tacos - I liked the cod and the short rib, but the pork and the chicken were kind of plain.  We had the guac to start which was pretty good, except that it took a while to come out.  My girlfriend ordered the adult horchata drink which was not very good in that it was way too strong and not very tasty.  It tasted like a whole lot of rum in a slushee and it didn't come out until halfway through the meal. 

All in all, it could have been worse, but it could have also been way better.  Free advice to management from someone who has a lot of industry experience: work on the ticket times for the kitchen and work on scheduling more people during happy hour because you are only hurting yourself by trying to run a skeleton crew."}
{"text":"Super cute restaurant.  Loved the old toolboxes for lights and maps for wallpaper.  I thought the food was so-so.  I'm kinda a taco junkie.  I thought the tacos lacked a punch in flavor as well as the gauc.  The best thing I had was the flatbread taco which the meat was super good.  I took it off the flatbread, as that was too much for me."}
{"text":"Look, I get that you're just a hotel bar. You don't have to try that hard because tired guests will always find their way to you for food and drink. But please just try a little harder. You're in the basement of The Graduate. Doesn't that mean we're supposed to have graduated from the plastic beer glasses and highball cups you're using? Don't charge me $12 for a drink and then pour it into a plastic cup. I'm not a college student and don't like being treated like one when I'm paying good money to eat at your establishment. Service was okay; I agree with the previous reviewer who said the pours were laughably small. The steak sandwich was one of the worst I've ever had -- it fell apart in my hands, it was overcooked (despite a request for it to come rare) and underseasoned; the fries from the freezer were even worse -- undercooked and underseasoned. If you must come here, get the tacos."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour before a musical at Gammage since it was very close to the venue but sad to report that the drinks and food were very mediocre. 

The shrimp tacos were some of the worst tacos I have ever had. No flavor and they give street tacos a bad name. I ordered the Paloma and hubby ordered a margarita. It was bottom grade tequila and too heavy on the ice. Unfortunately, we will not return to this restaurant as we both agreed it was not worthy of a second chance. Giving an extra star for the nice server. It's not her fault that the food was average and overpriced. 

It was so bad that we took a walk to Casey Moore's after in the opposite direction since we had time before our show."}
{"text":"Stopped here last night for a quick bite before catching a show at Gammage.  I'd recommend it for ease of parking and proximity to the theater alone.  Fortunately, the food was pretty darn tasty, too.  
I started with Blood Orange Caipirissima cocktail, which was good, if a little sweet.  My wife had the Mexican Mule, which she really enjoyed.  We both each had a braised short rib taco and a battered cod taco, and these were delicious.  Great flavor, great textures, and would definitely order again.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"We visited before going over to Gammage. There was only one other table of people eating at 5:15pm. We ordered chips and salsa, and drinks and they came quickly and were good. We placed our dinner order chicken fajitas for me and steak tacos for my friend. They came immediately, but the taco portion was tiny for $13 and the $12 fajitas were cold, like they were made previously and heated in a microwave. Usually fajitas are sizzling. These were soggy and the meat was dry. I ate it because we didn't have time to go anywhere else but I won't ever go back and highly recommend going basically ANYWHERE else."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to eating here before a show last night. The online pics looked great and reviews were good. I was thoroughly disappointed and felt ripped off. I ordered the 2 tiny chili shrimp tacos which came with a small piece of roasted corn. 11.00$ I have been a chef for 30 years and I know my stuff. That corn was frozen. I can tell because it was totally soggy even after being roasted The shrimp in my taco were frozen cooked shrimp simmered in some chili sauce. There was just a few scraggly pieces of cabbage and garnished with a couple chili slices. Very sparse, sad, limp and soggy as the tortilla disintegrated as I tried to eat it. I would of had a better meal down the road at Chipotle."}
{"text":"I came to Tapacubo with a friend awhile back for happy hour and was pleased with their offerings. The service was very good, with our waitress giving good honest opinions to help us order. I ended up getting 3 tacos - a cochinita, a fried fish, and a short rib. All were tasty, but I liked the two meat options better than the fish. I liked that there were several different salsas, but none of them were terribly special. Overall, the food was good, the portions were large, and the prices were pretty standard. I also had the ginger based marg, which was very tasty, while my friend had the cheapest standard marg, which was horrific... I wouldn't recommend it at all. Anyway, I could see myself visiting Tapacubo again in the future."}
{"text":"What's not to like about a poolside cantina that serves tacos and \"leaded\" margaritas? What I didn't expect was a place like this to exist in a mediocre hotel across the street from Arizona State University.

Located in the Graduate Hotel in Tempe, this is obviously the place out-of-town parents go when visiting their kids at school. We happened to be there at the end of Spring Break, so it was a little quieter than usual (which was totally fine by me).

What really surprised me about Tapacubo was their cocktail program. These guys make some serious (and potent) adult beverages. The drink that ultimately won me over was their Tequila Old-Fashion (Casa Nobles Reposado / Baked Apple Bitters / Tuaca / Agave). It was refreshing variation on a cocktail normally made with bourbon. Apparently, this particular Old-Fashion was recently named one of the \"best cocktails\" in Arizona (that's high praise for a tequila-centric state). I also had a chance to sip on their Border Patrol (Four Roses Bourbon / Zarco Blanco / Blood Orange Bitters / Lime / Agave). Both cocktails were as good as any you might order in a Bay Area mixologist bar, and only cost $8 (in SF, those drinks would easily be $12).

My co-workers and I also had the chance to eat here for lunch. While the taco-centric won't necessarily win any James Beard awards,the large portions will certainly fill you up even if you're on a college student budget. I believe I ordered 2 tacos and a side for just $9, and I could barely finish half of my plate. Diner warning: although they claim to serve Elote, it's really not authentic. It's essentially a giant bowl of creamed corn without much spice or flavor. 

All in all, Tapacubo had a fun, casual vibe. If I were ever to return to Tempe, I could see myself grabbing a few tacos and a Tequila Old-Fashion and soaking up the Arizona sun by the pool. It doesn't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"Good service and great tacos not here often but when I am I come to this place for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and even better service! Rick was great and made us delicious margaritas!!! Will definitely be back my next time in Phoenix! Love the tacos."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place before an event at the Gammage. Looked very nice inside and the bartenders were great. Drinks were good. As for the food, well, presentation was nice but we were totally disappointed. Chicken tacos were bland, the Chicken Tortilla soup was glorified tomato soup and unfinishable. The Spicy Garlic fries were fine but not spicy and little garlic.
I'd go back for drinks but food isn't worth it I'm sad to say."}
{"text":"Usually a small menu means a restaurant does their offerings well. This place is the exception. With a menu only consisting of 1 salad, 4 different tacos, 2 fajitas, and 3 apps, I was utterly disappointed. At the server's suggestion, i had shrimp tacos and chips and guac. Upon receiving my shrimp tacos (2 tiny tacos for $11, served with what they call \"elote\" which is just frozen corn on the cob with a stick in it and topped with flavorless mayonnaise) I was extremely disappointed with how dainty the dish was. It only got worse. I believe the shrimp may have been frozen too long and it literally turned to a mush when i chewed into it. I actually thought it was soggy tortilla by the texture, Til i realized that was actually the shrimp! I ate 3/4 of one of the tiny tacos, and had 2 bites of the \"elote\" (i still feel bad calling it that, as it is *not* the elote we all know and love.

The guacamole was great, but their salsa also left much to be desired and tasted very bland. I think the house salsa is usually a good indicator of the quality of any Mexican place. I wish i would've tasted it first and left without ordering anything more."}
{"text":"Great vibe and atmosphere. The margaritas are amazing!! On the campus of Arizona State University and it's beautiful here! Reminds me of a restaurant I'd eat in Austin! 

The guacamole is amazing, a little lime-y for me. I'm just picky. The elites on the menu could use some salt, but again just me. 

I'll be back when I come visit Phoenix once again next year!"}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review and I had such an appalling experience that I had to write. This restaurant is the closest restaurant to Gammage Auditorium where I had tickets for a 7:30 show.  Given the location, the restaurant should be thoroughly familiar with the theatre crowd.   My niece and I arrived at 6:15, were promptly seated and ordered just water. The waitress came back a few minutes later and took our order - the menu looked good - and we both ordered salads. 30 minutes later, I advised our waitress that we had theater tickets and she said she would check on our order. Coming back 10 minutes later, we were told that it would be another 20 minutes until our SALADS were ready!   It was 7:10, no food served, and we told her we had to leave.  Tapacubo needs to get its act together, unless they just don't care about serving the Gammage crowd. I won't be returning there. (Great refills on the water, though!)"}
{"text":"We were stuck at this hotel without a rental car, so we decided to try it. No real designated eating area here, so you have to sit around a bar. The microscopic portions of food that they serve are bland AND, as a bonus, overpriced! Do yourself a flavor ( pun intended) and walk a short distance down the street to Chipotle rather than dining here or at the hotel's other dismal failure of a restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd review. This is our hood and they just cannot get it right here. The staff is awful. The bartender (Sunday night football - twice) has no personality, attention to detail, the ability to make eye contact or even the ability to pretend. 

The food has gone from bad to worse. Not fresh, dirty plates and my husband actually had a plastic broken fork (the tip) in his nachos. I suspect this was a \"recycled\" plate of nachos. 

They clearly are trying to do something new. New furniture on the front patio, new chairs, staff but it's not working. I don't know who is running the show here, but I really wish a higher up would get their eyes on the bad business being done here. 

Tapacubo bar is flat and lacking energy. 

This is our local bar. Walking distance. Community. I would never recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am sad that so many out-of-towners who stay at The Graduate will eat this \"Mexican\" food and think that's what AZ has to offer. The food was expensive, not fresh, sparse and poorly executed overall. The margarita (I sprung for the premium) was mostly sour mix and was really sweet. And they charge you for chips and salsa...neither of which are great. The guacamole tasted like the kind you buy pre-made. I got a salad, and the lettuce (a toddler's handful) was literally wilted and the only other ingredients were a couple pieces of something red (sun dried tomato?) and, like, a 1/4 tablespoon of dressing. It was sad looking and it made me sad. I feel bad giving it such a bad review because the service was great and the food came out quickly. This could really be a great place if they focused on quality."}
