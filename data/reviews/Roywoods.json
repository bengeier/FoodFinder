{"text":"It used to have a bigger portion like at least 6-7pieces of jerk chicken per plate, now only 4 piece limited every time we go."}
{"text":"Try this place today.  Ordered chicken wings, and they are burned as hell... the chef probably just forgot he's cooking them.  Won't order again."}
{"text":"If you're looking for anything remotely close to authentic Caribbean food, this isn't it."}
{"text":"2 words = spicy and tasty. The right kind of spicy, not the kind that hurts your poor stomach! Always get the jerk chicken sandwich with potato wedges and spicy sauce."}
{"text":"Not good...whoever is managing this place needs training themselves...lazy manager Oxtail has no flavor, curried goat sucks! That's not jerk chicken that's stewed chicken!!! Go to Eglinton or Ritz on college street for the real deal"}
{"text":"I ordered a jerk plate and they gave me the meat they put on the sandwich on a bed of bland rice and peas.  It tasted like baked chicken with jerk marinade.  As a sandwich, it might work, and i will give that a try next time.  With \"woods\" in the name I was expecting more smoke in the jerk."}
{"text":"I went three different times -  1st time was amazing. Super friendly, a tad slow but my jerk chicken plate was amazing and super saucy and I got steamed veggies. 2nd time I waited almost 20 minutes while they made my catfish fresh. I didn't mind waiting for the cooking, but ten minutes was literally waiting for the girl to physically put my fish on the rice. And when I went home I realized they didn't give me coleslaw. But the catfish is amazing, I highly recommend. 3rd time I'm also waiting forever to be served because they couldn't find a pen for someone to sign their credit card receipt. So three people are milling around the back and the one front counter staff is running around for a pen, and the lineup is five deep. I order, remind them I want the coleslaw, pop in the washroom, go home with my order and it's a few hunks of dry chicken on rice with no sauce. The sauce makes a huge difference. I was soooo sad.  TLDR - slow service, inconsistently trained staff, inconsistently decent food. Ask for extra sauce. Catfish is great."}
{"text":"Oxtail was not very good and super small portions for the price. Not authentic and not very appetizing. Throughly disappointing! Do yourself a favour and make the walk to queen street and try Pats !!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times now. Although the pricing at first glance seems higher than most of your go to caribbean food spots, the value and flavours are beyond measure. You definitely taste the quality in their cooking at this place. The jerk chicken is a must have and is moist and balanced with flavour. The beef patties are some of the best I've had. The rice and peas are decent and the coleslaw is a bit lacking in flavour but overtop the jerk chicken in a sandwich is a great pairing. Recommend this place 100%. Been meaning to try the curry goat and the fried chicken as they both look great, but I can never look past how good the jerk chicken is."}
{"text":"Their jerk chicken is tasteless and lack of flavor. BBQ chicken is ok but for that price I would expect something better. Tried their ox tail as well - simply no flavor..."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the jerk chicken sandwich. One of my top sandwiches in the city. Chicken pieces are huge and premium, not like a lot of other jerk spots. Bread is crazy soft. Wings are good too. Just ordered 2 sandwiches for myself 10 mins ago..."}
{"text":"I didn't go to this place for so long. Totally regret it. This place is awesome. Food was so good we went back 2 days later. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Good price point, friendly staff, nice and fast. Coconut bread sandwich's are bomb. Open till 4am so awesome for late night guilt free munchies."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken is good. Coleslaw has no Flavour. Their homemade hot sauce is great! Service could be more friendly."}
{"text":"**3.5 stars** Tried the Jerk Chicken Plate, meat was nice and juicy/flavorful with a nice spicy kick to it.  Very nice, the rice is on par but I was disappointed by the slaw. It looks very creamy but it lack  flavor.  The portion size is on the smaller end for what I am paying.  I will be back for the curry goat next time as it looked very good. The staff was super friendly and showed us what he got under each component. Also gave us some of the house-made hot sauce, it was super spicy so I got it on the side."}
{"text":"Went into for a late night snack. Found out the next day I got charged 20 bucks for a cup of jerk chicken. Great staff ."}
{"text":"Yay for more diversity in fort York area! So I've only had the jerk chicken but it's delicious! Chicken is juicy, and it tastes fresh. They give you a good mix of white and dark meat. Coleslaw on the side really cools off the heat. They have this scotch bonnet hot sauce which is crazy spicy but crazy good."}
{"text":"I've been to Roywoods twice in the last 3 days. When it's -5 degrees Celsius out side you need some heat and this is where you find it.  The jerk chicken was one of the best in Toronto. One bite and your taste buds will immediately confirm these guys aren't using Grace Jerk Chicken Marinade!  Aside from the flavour, it's incredibly moist. Not dried out like you might find at the other chains in the city. For those who don't want to struggle with bones, you'll be pleasantly surprised that the meat is boneless. Get it in a plate or sandwich form. You can't go wrong either way because plate comes with generous sides and the sandwich?  The bun is coco bread!!!    I had the beef patty today; spicy. Just the right amount of heat to warm your body up!  The pasty light fluffy and the meat on the inside tender not dried out. Again, the spices used are authentic so his is also not your commercially processed patty. And at $2.25 a patty why anyone would even bother to go to Tim Horton's across the street for a bagel is beyond me. (No disrespect to Tim's, you are in institution in your own right.)  Finally- though you won't find a ton of dine in space to enjoy your meal you do have plenty of bar stools and surface area to rest your meal. Best of all though is the ambience. Big floor to ceiling windows looking out to City Place, the best in hip-hop, r&b, soul and Caribbean music playing with an awesome flat screen tv to catch up on the box score (go Raptors!)  I've lived in Toronto for 32 years.  I come back frequently to visit and I can say this:  The food is authentic and of great quality. The prices are good and you're definitely getting great value. Finally, I will make a pit stop here every time I visit!"}
{"text":"I tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt and actually went there twice with friends think the first time might have just been an off day.   This is by far the worse \"Caribbean\" food I have ever tasted. The chicken is dry, extremely hard and very bland. The sauce taste and smells awful. We also tried their shrimp .....smh how can anyone mess up shrimp? They were hard and bland as well.   I would suggest that they re-evaluate the seasonings that they use and prep the chicken better prior to cooking. In the end I ended up only eating the rice because sadly that was the only thing I could stomach.   Never again....I'd rather go hungry.  Price are high and food is bad. I guess most people in the area might find this place good and that's probably because they just have nothing to compare it to.    There better out there guys. I promise."}
{"text":"We are visiting from Houston and I have recently turned my three sons on to Jerk chicken. When my pickiest eater said this is really good mom, I feel like we made a great choice. I ordered the jerk shrimp sandwich which was amazing. We had two jerk chicken dinners, jerk wings, plantains and fried chicken. It was all very good. You won't regret your decision to try their food."}
{"text":"Good flavour in terms of the meat. I came here twice since I live in the neighbourhood. I got a sandwich combo with a pop and a lunch combo with rice and coleslaws. For the price I was paying, I expected way bigger portion, but it was not - and I'm only a tiny girl of 5'1 and 110lbs. Also pop selection is really limited."}
{"text":"I tried the restaurant on two separate occasions because the first time I went the food was okay, at best, and the service was really slow. I went again and yep, the food was okay and the service was really slow leading me to believe that is the verdicts on the restaurant. The food is not bad but it's not real jerk chicken- as in it's not grilled BBQ style or seasoned with authentic spices(def not spicy). Having had and knowing real jerk chicken, I must say I was disappointed. And it was kind of expensive for the mediocre \"jerk\" chicken."}
{"text":"I got the BBQ chicken sandwich as per another reviewer's recommendation. The chicken itself was excellent. Cooked perfectly - tender, just the right amount of sauce, it was great. They also put plenty of it in my sandwich.  The sandwich itself though wasn't up to par with what I'd hoped for (especially for $11). The bread was tough/stale (and I'm pretty sure it's not the fact that they were coco buns that made them that way), and even though there were toast marks on the buns, they were room temperature which was quite puzzling. The coleslaw inside the sandwich also lacked flavour, it was basically just shredded lettuce and mayo. I mean, still pretty good but all that wasted potential!!! Especially with that amazing chicken.  Anyhow, I came here mainly to say... please, train your workers before you leave them to fend for themselves. I tried getting the daily special at first (jerk chicken + caesar salad), but no one knew how to prep the salad because the chef wasn't in. I also watched as the two poor workers juggled between reading instructions on how to prepare orders, handling Foodora on the phone, taking orders in person, and tending the cash. The overall wait time ended up being pretty long for one sandwich even though there was no one in line before me when I first arrived.  All things considered, probably best place to get a quick chicken meal around Cityplace."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and staff is great! Had the various chickens, oxtail, goat, and curry. Try their homemade hot sauce--it's insanely spicy. Be sure to wash it down with some of the unique sodas they have! Open super late on weekends!"}
{"text":"Best quick food joint in Cityplace hands down  Prices are good  Food is plentiful  Beef patties and jerk are fire  Open late on weekends  What else do would you want?? If you want more than that you can go fuck yourself because this place is bomb"}
{"text":"Jerk chicken was great, and the rice wasn't dry like other Jamaican places I've tried. Friendly staff, chill vibes and bonus with the Jamaican pops drinks was amazing!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't waste a single dollar here. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich as well as a spicy beef patty through foodora. The beef patty was not fresh. It was flavourless and hard. The fried chicken sandwich looked appetizing at first but when I bit into the chicken and realized it wasn't white meat. I was grossed out. I ended up eating coleslaw in a coco bun for dinner. So for $17 or so I got to eat a bite of a stale beef patty and a coco bun with some coleslaw."}
{"text":"Visited Toronto and one of the locals recommended Roywoods.  Delicious jerk chicken, rice and peas and seasoned vegetables.  I'm really picky about my jerk but they did not disappoint.  We added extra juice/gravy from the jerk to our rice and peas and it was so darned delicious!  Great dining experience."}
{"text":"Most definitely recommend this place. Have the jerk chicken plate for hearty meal. Awesome."}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighbourhood Roywoods! Jerk chicken sandwich is really yummy. Service is a tiny bit slow but no complaints from me!"}
{"text":"The food here is consistently great.  I take anyone visiting from out of town and recommend the jerk chicken sandwich to introduce them. Everything on the menu is fantastic."}
{"text":"I love jerk chicken!!!! This restaurant has the best jerk chicken dinner with beans and rice and coleslaw for belly filling meal.   I hear the beef patty coconut bun is to die for.   Get your fix, it is so good."}
{"text":"Jerk pork sandwhiches here are on point. Pork wasn't dry at all, nice juicy pieces- lean not fatty either! Love the cocobread"}
{"text":"Upon trying out Roywoods again thought it deserved an update to 5 stars.  Spiciness has been stepped up and the Jerk chicken sandwich is amazing.  All they need now is to get on Ritual so I can order on my way home!!"}
{"text":"Living in the Cityplace area, it's always great to have super late night options.  Roywoods is one of them.  This is a takeout joint only, it has very limited seating (around under 10 seats).    However...they give you VERY generous portions of great jerk food.....for 10.99 for jerk/fried chicken with lots of rice and beans and your choice of coleslaw or steamed veggies, you won't leave hungry.    I ordered jerk chicken with plenty of jerk sauce, rice and beans and steamed veggies, it weighed in at 832g for the takeout box.    My hubby ordered fried chicken with rice and beans and steamed veggies, his box came up to 790 g.      On Friday and Saturday night, they are open till 4am!     If you have late night after clubbing munchies, you know you are set!     Definitely a great choice for a quick dinner (and well I can also usually pack a lunch for next day)."}
{"text":"I wish they put less rice and more chicken and other stuffs. Food is ok, I think it's pricey for what you get. But it's convince to grab n go."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I was looking forward to ordering from this place based on the other reviews and photos. Ordered through foodora and paid $25 (which included an upgrade of \"extra\" meat for $4.50). When the food came the box it was in was teeny tiny and there was what looked like the most most modest serving (1 small serving at best) of the blandest fried chicken. All this atop a bed of clearly once frozen completely unseasoned steamed vegetables. Like the kind you buy in the frozen food aisle in a jumbo bag for $3.99. I contacted foodora who called the kitchen and confirmed that this was the correct order- what?! Based on the other photos this was definitely not correct. Frankly I wouldn't have wanted another order anyway, but the lack of ownership for charging someone $25 for something that was SO mediocre at best is terrible customer service. Definitely not going to be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I took to long getting out here, which is inexcusable since I live in CityPlace - but since I saw the signs I kept telling myself to get there.  And I kicked myself for waiting so long.  I had the jerk chicken plate - the portion was huge - I could have saved half for a second meal, but it was so good that I couldn't resist finishing it. The spicing was perfect - I've had jerk that was so spicy that the heat buried the flavour - and that was so lightly spiced that there was nothing to it. Roywoods has the balance about perfect. The meat was nice and flavourful, not dry and tough, just right. Rice and peas were really good and the slaw had a nice flavour.  Good value, I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is the place for the uninformed. This is far from Jamaican.  Although I can only comment from having the beef patty; it was the THE worst Jamaican beef patty I've ever had. The crust has hard and not flaky, the beef filling was basically unseasoned. I've had better patties off of a food truck. Just looking at the other items, which were pretty much covered in sauce probably to mask the fact that it's not truly seasoned in true Jamaican fashion I would not waste my money on this place."}
{"text":"I ordered take out here yesterday for 3 people. I ordered oxtail, jerk chicken sandwich and jerk chicken with rice.  The oxtail was nothing great. I had great oxtail before and this dish was missing the bold flavour the others have. The rice was dry and could use more beans in it. It didn't have the coleslaw either which would help balance out the dish.  The jerk sandwich was thick and dry and came with a sauce that looked like duck sauce. The ones you get when you buy a BBQ duck. The sauce helped with the dryness. Or else it would be hard to swallow.  The jerk chicken dinner was nothing special. It was the same chicken that was in the jerk sandwich. The rice was the same as the oxtail.  The food was mediocre and it would be okay for late night food since it opens till 4 in the morning. But if there's other options. I would of tried something else."}
{"text":"Jerk Chicken Plate: Large portion (4 pieces of chicken, TONs of rice). I made this into two, filling meals.   Good for quick take-out if you're craving Jerk chicken, and good if you're looking to save some of it for lunch at work the next day  I wish it was a little spicier, and a little less salty? After I had it I was extremely thirsty all night from the amount of salt.  People that work there were really nice :)"}
{"text":"Never been there but this is HANDS DOWN the best Caribbean food that you can have delivered to your door in the city.  I get the jerk pork plate every time. Coleslaw is insanely good. Prices are fair, portions are good, spice levels are perfect.  I order at least once a month.   Great find!"}
{"text":"I had supper this evening at Roywoods.  I've walked by it a few times and have been wanting to try it.  I love jerk chicken so that's what I ordered.  The meals come with rice and coleslaw ... I'm not a fan of coleslaw so asked them to not give me any and they gave me veggies instead.  I'm not a fan of veggies so I just pushed them aside.  I ate my meal at a table on their patio.  The rice and beans were really good and the jerk chicken was delicious.  It was all boneless and the jerk spice had a nice kick.  I look forward to getting it again.  I brought Gord home some fried chicken, rice and coleslaw.  The chicken was also boneless.  He said it was good and he'd get it again.  The staff serving me were friendly.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Extremely pleasant surprise when my Foodora order arrived. I often find that the types of food requiring an ethnic authenticity have a tough time delivering in the city core. This was definitely not the case, as Roywoods might stand up against any Eglington West jerk joint or west-end Caribbean spot I've tried as far as their curry. The curry goat was fall off the bone tender and super flavourful. The jerk chicken was tender and spicy, but lacked the real char I enjoy, and I'm not sure about going boneless."}
{"text":"i've been three times. i've tried their sandwiches and their plates and everything has been good. perhaps once the chicken was a touch dry. i really like their beef patties.   i've always found the service at roywoods to be friendly. the interior is nothing to write home about and their sign is puzzlingly \"corporate\", but i don't hold that against them.  overall, it's a competent and consistent place to satisfy your jerk craving."}
{"text":"I think there's nothing like having the choice of ethnic food at 2 in the morning. Toronto, you should count yourselves lucky! Not sure what all the bad reviews are about, but this Caribbean food is delicious! I've gone twice already since arriving in Toronto yesterday. The rice is pillowy soft, and the meat is plentiful. We got the jerk shrimp and the goat curry plate, and both were so delicious and piping hot!  Some items are made fresh to order (jerk shrimp) and some are taken from a pre-cooked pot (goat curry), if that sways you to choose one meal over the other. We also ordered the plantains, which I felt we could have done without. They are deep fried, but don't have much flavor to them. They do not wait until the plantains are ripe to serve them, so they have the texture of potatoes rather than that sweet taste you see in a dish like maduros.  The workers are wonderful too! Helped us navigate the menu and gave us some tips on what we should visit in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Had a quick fried chicken sandwich at 3:30am. Shared with my partner. Just got the coleslaw on it. Delicious!! Going back tomorrow night. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Roywoods- I'm sorry that I have to write a bad review based on first impressions.  I've read some great reviews so I sent a Caribbean food loving friend in to try out your food before I made the trek down there.   They told me it was good jerk chicken, the portion size was great, but the food wasn't amazing considering the other jerk places we've been to in Toronto. Tip: It needs more of a punch in flavour, don't worry about spicing it up more. For $8.99 plus tax it just didn't seem worth it considering we can get coco bread with patty or a jerk sandwich with coleslaw for $4-$7 taxes included. Plus, they weren't too excited about combo prices and being forced to buy a drink with the sandwich or meals. Good place to keep in the back pocket if we're in the area and craving jerk though..   I visited the place, nonetheless, wanting to support a new restaurant.   I ordered the jerk sandwich, asked if I could order without the drink and was told no, so I got water. (No issues there)  I watched the girl make my sandwich - large squeeze of mayo(too much for my liking but whatever, let's see where this goes), good portion of coleslaw and begin to wrap it before putting in all the ingredients the sign above said it came with.  I didn't want to argue, but maybe she just forgot?  M: Sorry, but does the sandwich come with tomatoes?  G: Oh we ran out M: Oh, well..do you think you should have told me when I ordered?  G: Oh, well I can cut some for you if you want.  M: That would be nice. Thanks  She takes less than 10 steps and I can see the open kitchen where she grabs a few slices of tomato and puts it in my sandwich..   So was she just being lazy or is this an integrity thing? She clearly had tomatoes in the back but was too lazy to slice them up and bring them to the front and then she lied to me and decided to skimp on the sandwich without informing me. When she got caught, she lied, then back tracked and did the right thing.   It's just courtesy and honest practice to inform your customers ahead of time when you're out of a menu item or ingredient rather than sweep it under the rug and continue on with a business transaction-it effects the consistency of your product and clientele relationships. Secondly, when your staff can't walk less than 10 steps to slice tomato... #hardlife   I would give this place another chance, food isn't bad, just on the expensive side.   Not a sit in place, so be prepared to grab and go."}
{"text":"Food was great and portion was large. I got the Jerk Large, BBQ Jerk Large and Jerk Wings. It is very flavorful. I feel like the display of the food could be better. The area was unorganized and a bit messy. Thankfully the food was good compared to how it looked. -1 star due to the service. Seemed like he didn't want to work or didn't care about anything. Overall, good."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 5 stars based on the food and service :) This Jerk Shop is, as many others said here is basically a take out joint with a few seats inside and on the patio. What makes this place though is the food. Large flavorful portions (you really need to try the Chicken Jerk Plate which comes with rice and peas and a very tasty and unique coleslaw) The Chicken Jerk Sandwich is just as good. Prices are very reasonable here as well :)"}
{"text":"I wish this place offered consistency but they don't.   They do offer excellent jerk chicken which is often sold out. I love their rice and peas when they remember to put the oxtail gravy on it. I appreciate their generous portions, even if it's of the yummy BBQ chicken and not the jerk chicken I really wanted.  Their Jamaican patties are kind of pricey and not very good. Oh and I want their coleslaw recipe!  Service is slow."}
{"text":"Great food. I tried the Jerk Chicken plate the first visit and the jerk chicken sandwich the second time. Both were outstanding. Amazing addition to a neighbour desperate for quality food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Got the Jerk chicken plate. Chicken was very juicy, good perfectly. Flavoring was not bad. Rice was okay. Coleslaw has no flavor. Place was clean. Expensive compared to the amount of food you get. Small portions, but its expected for that area."}
{"text":"A small but cozy restaurant located in the dense Fork York community. Although parking was a pain in the butt to find, the food makes up for it. I've heard about Roywoods from a colleague of mine and she recommended the Fried Chicken Sandwich (comes with a pop for about 9$/combo). It was perfectly balanced; the slaw and the chicken goes so well with the coco bread. I also tried their bbq chicken which surprisingly stood out to me because most Caribbean places only offer jerk or fried chicken. One thing that could change would be the service. It was pretty slow, I had to wait over 20 minutes for \"fresh\" chicken and the girl working at the front looked like she hated her job with a passion. Overall, this place is one of the better Caribbean joints in the city."}
{"text":"Local post club favorite. Came 3 times within 48 hours.   First night did the jerk chicken, rice and coleslaw. Was delicious especially after some drinks. Service was very good and playlist was amazing. The food was fantastic also. Came again the next morning for a jerk chicken sandwich. Yummmmm!  Came for a 3rd time at night about 2am. Must admit I was kinda disappointed. The bread and meat were cold. Third time wasn't the charm this time I suppose.  Open till 4am on Fri and Sat. Right around the corner from my cousins so next time in town, I will return but double check I get the warm items."}
