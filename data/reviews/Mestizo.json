{"text":"My wife and I ate for the first time at Mestizo last week and had a wonderful dining experience in every respect.  I have been surprised at some of the less than stellar reviews as our food and service really could not have been better.  The restaurant was not crowded when we arrived, but filled up while we were there.  Nonetheless, our sevice was prompt and attentive without being obnoxious.  The cuisine is high-end Mexican, so if you are looking for the # 3 combo this is probably not your place.  You should set your expectations for higher prices than you might be accustomed to at Mexican restaurants.  We ordered different pork dishes that were cooked with completely different spices - both had intense flavors and were delicious.  We started with Margaritas and they were the real deal - not the  typical slush machine variety.  Mestizo is a Mexican restaurant like I would expect to find in Houston or Dallas.  I could not recommend it more highly."}
{"text":"Amazing Salmon served over thinly sliced cactus... Sipping Rutherford Cab Napa Valley listening to Mexican music sitting outside... Awesome. Life is good..."}
{"text":"Was hoping for better. 

Dinner there tonight. Had chips, salsa, guacamole, lobster soup and the steak/shrimp dish with margaritas. 

Service was terribly slow despite a slow night at the restaurant. The margaritas were so weak I'm not sure they even had tequila. Had a blackberry (blah), lime, and a house and didn't feel like I'd had anything but sugar water. 

Guacamole was not good. 

Food was not very good. The steak was way over cooked. Taste was lacking and just not well balanced. 

Will not go back. Plenty of other good restaurants around and hopefully more to come. 

Even if you eat here, get your drinks at Kindred up the street."}
{"text":"The food is good, no faults at all to report there and I was happy with the service I received. However, the price tag ruins the experience. There is no justification for the high market prices you pay. You are pay fine dining price for decent but not exceptional food. This restaurant would get full stars if it were priced correctly."}
{"text":"My wife and I love the restaurants in Davidson! I have tried Mestizo a few times. This will be the last time. We were there early for dinner on a Friday. So, the restaurant was not very busy. First, I know good queso and guacamole... the queso was cold and no flavor. The quacamole was runny and not fresh. I ordered the flat iron steak. It came out cold... remember that we are the only ones in the restaurant! I received my meal about the time my wife was finishing her fajitas which were tough! It was OK once I got it. The manager did come by... however we paid full price for the meal. The server did not apologize... something about my meal sitting under a fan... really!! You can do better!!!"}
{"text":"Food is sub par at best. The Margaritas are great. The majority of the entrees are around 20 to 25 dollars. One of the friends we were with is a professional chef. He and another friend ordered the carne y cameron. The seafood reeked of ammonia and was inedible and the steak was tough. One was sent back and the other was left on the plate. I had the special that night which was grouper over a rice cake. It was cooked okay but drowned in sauce. We live close so its unfortunate will not go back to eat there."}
{"text":"Had the worst lunch I have ever had!  If I could give a negative star I would. Ordered a top shelf margarita, it was all mix. Ordered empanadas, I sent them back. They tasted like a sponge. The waiter brought me crab cakes instead. Another mistake. It was all filler. So my friend and I ordered a bowl of lobster soup. Tasted like it was right out of a can. There was not 1 piece of lobster in it at all. The waiter asked if we liked it, we both said no. We actually paid for that garbage and left!  Service was awful. The manager nor the owner came over to the table to speak with us and ask what was wrong. That is poor customer service at its finest!  DON'T waste your time OR money!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here numerous times and the food has been consistently good. Easily the best Mexican restaurant in the area. Better than Prickly Pear. It is not your typical Mexican restaurant as food is a little pricey and small portions but as stated above the food is good. Inside seating can be cramped but does not affect positive atmosphere. Family owned and operated. Service is fine. If you have not eaten here and find yourself in the Huntersville, Cornelius or Davidson area make a reservation."}
{"text":"AWESOME!  Server Tara was incredible!  Pleasant and professional!  Fast service and great food!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on a Saturday after checking out all of the offerings on Main St. We initially passed it by due to the 3 star rating, but I'm so glad that we came back. The menu has a great variety of different things and it was difficult to make a decision. We settled on queso, mini crab cakes, pambazo and tres leches cake. Everything was great! Very fresh and we felt the portion sizes were perfect for lunch. The service was phenomenal! Both the hostess and our server were very welcoming and provided a wonderful experience. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fun, upbeat restaurant in the heart of Davidson.   Different and flavorful margarita and a good meal.  I had the steak fajitas and my wife had and the shrimp with plantains.  Mine was good, hers was excellent.  Friendly staff and a nice atmosphere.  My water glass stayed full and we were served in short amount of time.  Good experience!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Entrees bland. Service slow. Our waitress never came to check on us, just stood around. Prices are too high for the quality of food. Very disappointed , wanted to like it.. Great location. Drinks were good. I would return for drinks and appetizers only."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere was excellent.   Service not so much.  Everything was great up until I received my food then I never saw my waitress again.  Had to even flag someone down for my check."}
{"text":"The food and margaritas were very underwhelming.  Our margaritas didn't taste like they had a drop of tequila in them and we even requested a specific tequila to be used.  We ordered guacamole which was not fresh.  When our meals arrived, my chicken enchiladas, two open faced ones, had less than 3 pieces of 1/4\" square pieces of chicken in each one.  The wait staff took it back to the kitchen and they added two bites to one of the two enchiladas. In the entire dish, there was not a 1/4 of a breast of chicken total.  The other two meals we ordered were fajitas, steak and chicken.  They did not come with any sides, no rice, no cheese, no chunky salsa, etc.  The flavors of all the meals fell flat.  Again, it was very underwhelming and we will not return.  We will stick with going to Prickly Pear with a beautiful water view with much better food and drinks."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Metizo. The first was shortly after they opened and was more than a little rough around the edges. I decided to give them a second chance recently and the improvement was amazing. Food was nicely made and creative, serving size went along with the price, and service was competent and friendly. I had the fish tacos. There was a large amount of grilled fish in each, the cabbage topping was tasty without overwhelming the fish. Also had a side a guacamole, large fresh serving, nicely flavored. Chips were refilled promptly. Salsa was also very good. Service was warm and they checked on us numerous times during the meal. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! The food is excellent and the service is great. You have to try the different types of margaritas! It's hard to find a good mexican restaurant but this has exceeded our expectations. A must go to! I would give it 10 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful meal at this great local restaurant! The atmosphere is just dreamy. It took us back to Mexico City near the Zocalo. I adore the murals of Templo Mayor and the origins of Mexico City. I just loved the decor!

The food was delicious, as were the fresh margaritas! Please order the mango and/or the guava margaritas. Incredibly fresh with the finest ingredients. Honestly, the best I've ever had.

We started with the Calamar, which is fresh calamari with two yummy sauces. It was a great appetizer.

For dinner, my husband had the Chamorro, which is a huge chunk of pork that has been braised for hours on the bone. Mmmm.... Outstanding! Super tender! Just delicious!

I had the Carne y Camarones, which is a tender filet steak topped with two shrimp stuffed with cilantro and Mexican cheeses and wrapped in prosciutto. I just can't even begin! It was awesome. 

Check out the pics and just go! You will love Mestizo!"}
{"text":"Slow service, even when the restaurant is not very busy.  You have to ask for more chips, salsa and refills on drinks, because they do not do a good job refreshing them automatically.  The food is delicious, and I would recommend their fajitas (especially their chicken- it is juicy and full of flavor).  For lunch they are reasonably priced and the decor is very fun and modern.  The restaurant may be small, but they do have a nice patio... It would be a great place to meet friends, or out of town guests.  I do hope that their service improves, because their food is very good!
*The location is also prime... It is located in the heart of beautiful historic downtown Davidson."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!   After living on the West coast for many years I had pretty much given up on finding any decent Mexican food on the East Coast until now.   Everything is so fresh and full of flavor.  The service was spot on."}
{"text":"After lunch on Wednesday I returned to Mestizo last night with two good friends to sample the dinner menu. Each of us rated our dinners as absolutely outstanding. I had the short ribs, one had the braised pork shank and one had the scallop/shrimp dinner...we also ordered the calamari and it was as special as the dinners. A shared piece of \"impossible cake\" topped it all off. Having Guadalupe stop by our table for a chat added to the enjoyment. Visit this wonderful addition to the Davidson dining scene!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and it was fantastic.  Steak and shrimp fajitas and a couple of their killer margaritas.  I'm not the biggest fan of sweet drinks, but they use fresh fruit in these and they're terrific.  Also, it's totally reasonable from a price perspective.  

Incredibly friendly staff, spot on service.  Will definitely make the drive from Charlotte to go again."}
{"text":"Both the food and sevice at Mestizo are lacking and I don't recommend you eat there.  Our reservation was for 8, we were seated at 8:30, and we were finally served at 10.  The wait staff paid very little attention to us even though we were a party of 8 and a substantial check.  We had to remind the staff several times to bring out water, chips, and salsa.  I usually don't mind service problems such as these but for a restaurant service $20 and higher dishes I expected a quality dining experience.  The food was alright but for the price I was hoping for much, much more.  We ordered $9 guacamole and we're given a half cup of guac that tasted like it came off a supermarket shelf.  The entree was no better, and I have no doubt any enchilada from the back of a food truck would be better and half the price to boot.  At least the drinks weren't bad...  I don't plan on eating here again, save your money and find a different restaurant."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow service. C'mon guys. Our waiter was AWOL. Same story for the neighboring tables. Too bad. Nice location and so much potential. I was really hoping for this to be one of our new favorite places to work in our rotation. 

You'd be better off ordering Chipotle and sitting on a bench downtown if you're looking for that experience. Bummer."}
{"text":"I won't be back. Food was luke warm and service wasn't noteworthy. Also, check your receipts...I left a cash tip but our waiter added an additional tip to our bill that I did not approve. Owner wasn't all too surprised when I called about it, but did not refund it. I had to dispute it with my credit card company."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!
The margaritas were weak, The Chicken Enchilatas contained chopped up unidentifiable vegetables, the chicken was scarce, chopped up tiny bits.
I had the mahi-mahi fish special that the waiter had bragged up big time. The fish was not even warm, dried out and hard around the edges as though it had been cooked a couple hours earlier.  
This place is the emperor's new clothes all right. Go to Verde for much better food for less money."}
{"text":"It was a wonderful experience, the place is full in tastes, the food, the ambience and service. 
The owner, Alicia was very attentive and the chef Raul came out to ask about food, you don't see this very often.
This place is for people who know about good food,  and want to be relax,  international plates with the Mexican taste, great fission!!!
A lot different than taquerias, they're good but there's no comparison.
Very job job and wish good luck!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Service could be better, but the unique entrees and flavors make up for it. I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"We've eaten several times at Mestizo and we love it. Their food is excellent and the service is most friendly"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem, and hands down the best Mexican food outside of my hometown, San Diego.  Delicious food, at a great price, with exceptional service.   The margaritas are top notch. You won't find club soda, orange juice, sprite or any other fillers many restaurants use to water down  and illegitimize their margaritas.  Mestizo makes the margaritas the way their were intended to be. Simple, with quality tequila. 

To the person who complained of $9 guacamole, that what you pay for guacamole with avocado chunks. This restaurant only uses quality ingredients, and that is something you have to pay for. That being said, everything is reasonably priced and worth paying for."}
{"text":"Favorite legit Mexican food spot on the east coast. Service is fast and the staff is very great. The atmosphere is very inviting and makes me feel at home. I Recommend everyone i know to stop by and have lunch or dinner there."}
{"text":"Worst meal in recent memory.

Cons.  $9 guacamole in a tiny cup, that has zero citrus flavor and tastes like avocados that have been sitting out too long?  Sitting at a table surrounded by flies, ordering a chicken dish that claims to be deboned on the menu but arrives fully boned, with gelatinous unrendered fat/skin, over cooked steak fajitas that didn't arrive sizzling? That has zero sides like at any other Mexican restaurant (e.g., guacamole and rice)? If that's what you're looking for, you have found it! 

Pros? The only bonus is that the wait staff is nice and tries their best.  

It's actually more expensive than our meal at kindred was, don't waste your money.  We tried it twice out of necessity and it was disappointing both times, but just awful the second time."}
{"text":"Brown guacamole. Waiter told me it was freshly made and argued with me. Wow! I just finally told him to leave it and I pushed it to the side. 10 minutes later he brought some that was in fact fresh. Beer wasn't cold. Nothing about the meals were good. Pretty sad."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed, the salsa tasted out of a jar, they don't bother asking if you want corn or flour tortillas, the seasoning was just a bit bland for my Chicago taste buds Great place for drinks and to socialize , have to try again to give it another chance."}
{"text":"A friend and  I had heard this new restaurant was good so we gave it a try during the week. We were seated and the place was fairly empty- 1 table of diners  inside and 3 other tables outside including us. We noticed the other tables had chips and salsa and we did not get any and my friend said we probably have to order and pay for them. We both ordered chicken fajitas and the food came out in literally 5 minutes! Everyone wants fast service but this is supposed to be fresh cooked food- no way was this just cooked. I really wanted to like the fajitas but they were so very bland, no flavor at all. The fajitas/ wraps themselves are usually large in most places about 9-10\" but these were small - about 5-6\" and each of us got 3. I'm usually the one that never finishes a meal and takes food home but not in this case. I was actually still a bit hungry when we left. We felt so rushed after we ate, the waiter brought out our bills immediately after we took our last bite of food and came looking for payment within 3-4 min. We were so surprised because the place was pretty empty and could not figure out what the rush was to get us out of there. On the way out my friend asked the other diners if they had to pay extra for chips/salsa and apparently not- we just didn't get them! I gave it 1 star because although the food was extremely bland it was not terrible and the service was not good."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it took this restaurant awhile to get it's footing (a lot of the bad reviews are old) but we went tonight and had a great experience. Great service, yummy food, nice environment. Lobster enchiladas in particular were really good! And great drinks :)"}
{"text":"Great lunch. We sat on the patio and I had the lobster paella enchiladas with scallops. Very light and fresh. Would love to have it again. Hubby had the fish tacos and thought it was super fresh with large chunks of fish. My margarita was fresh and flavorful. We can't wait to come back. ( we love the fans on the patio as its 90+ )"}
{"text":"If you sit outside, it is right across the street from a field where they have a concert every week giving great music while eating. Everyone was very friendly. The food was amazing. They were even open 4th of July which made for a great evening."}
{"text":"First, to be clear, this is not your average Mexican restaurant. 

I had the taco salad, which was the best taco salad I have ever eaten. My daughter had a filet with two large jumbo shrimp. 

It was excellent."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place today and was not impressed at all! Food was super bland and overpriced. Wont be back."}
{"text":"I've been to Mexico a lot and for small town NC, Mestizo is very authentic.  some dishes feel a little Americanized, but that's normal and even expected/wanted by many Americans.  The  internal ambience is cozy with warm colors on the walls and dozens of soft glowing restoration hardware style bulbs hanging from the ceiling, and uplifting and engaging yet not too loud latin music filld the air.  The outdoor terrace is large and well appointed with its own inviting lighting and umbrella-covered tables. The service is excellent.  One of the three owners is always there, and most of the staff are from Latin America and totally bilingual, knowledgeable,  and friendly. I've been there a dozen times so far and plan to go back often."}
{"text":"Upscale prices without upscale quality. 
Weak margaritas, small portions. 
Service was good. Atmosphere is good. Location is great. 
Food tasted meh."}
{"text":"Service & food have always been amazing at Meatizo! Lobster enchiladas are to die for! Great margaritas too."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Food was not only unique but excellent. The menu was really diverse and there were so many different choices that I found appealing. The prices were reasonable and appropriate and the portions were as well.  The atmosphere inside is really nice and the outside seating adds to it. Just make sure you call in a reservation cause once people try this place they will be back and getting a table might not be that easy."}
{"text":"I stopped here on a Saturday night with my Wife to grab a margarita while waiting for our reservation at Kindred - so take my review with a grain of salt. (see what I did there?)

Mestizo strikes me as one of those upscale Mexican restaurants. You know the kind, the ones that charge for chips and salsa. Expect to drop some dough here as main plates run about $20 each. That being said, you get what you pay for in some regards. The ambiance and side patio are well done and the staff was incredibly friendly. We stopped in for a drink and ended up sitting out front taking in the view of Davidson's campus across the street. We both ended up ordering a margarita - her the house, mine the jalapeno. I normally like things spicy. But holy mother of god, they must have chopped an entire jalapeno (seeds and all) and dropped it into my drink. The first sip hits the back of my throat like a freight train and I hope I had taste buds left over for Kindred. I say that as a warning - as I actually liked the drink - just be careful out there. I also can't say enough about the speed, attentiveness and kindness of the staff. Thanks for making us feel welcome. Seems like Mestizo has a good thing going here."}
{"text":"Many of the restaurants in the Davidson area are pretty small so I recommend calling in and making a reservation ahead of time. Mestizo is PRICEY!!! I don't know if it is appropriate for the prices to be that high for the food you get. 

I got the Salmon Al Nopal because I wanted to try the cactus. I had extremely high expectations since the prices were so high. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed with my meal. It wasn't bad, it was actually decent but there were many technical things that just made it bad. My salmon was EXTREMELY salty. It was so salty to the point that I had to order flour tortillas to wrap the salmon to tone down the saltiness a bit. Some of the cacti was overcooked and no longer soft, but rather chewy. The salmon was burnt because the grill was too hot. The salmon was very tender inside (and slightly undercooked) but overcooked on the outside. 

I liked the chips and salsa since the chips were not oily at all. The service here is amazing though and the manager is so sweet. I wish the food was comparable to the prices. If I pay that much money for my food, it better be pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had in a while. Got the lobster paella enchilada and the mestizo margarita.. small place downtown Davidson but a cool atmosphere with great service. Only thing was the portion sizes weren't huge but they make up for it with the steady flow of chips and salsa before the meal comes out. Great place"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food.  This is not the typical Mexican restaurant that covers theirr food in sauce to mask it.  This is top quality food and prepared in authentic Mexican style.  The staff is friendly, professional, and always happy to see you whether you are a repeat customer or a first time diner.  You are going to love it."}
{"text":"Weak margaritas, bland guacamole, poor service, high prices.  We waited 20 minutes for food with empty glasses before finally deciding to leave. Then had to wait another 5 for the manager to close our tab. Still had a$35 tab for 2 beers, the weak margarita and bland guacamole.   While the waiter was apologetic, the manager offered no apologies or any attempt to mitigate the poor experience.  

We won't be back."}
{"text":"Tried this place with my husband because we both love Mexican food and wanted to see how it compared to Verde. Think we will stick with Verde. The guacamole was too chunky and very wet. It also had a strange, sharp aftertaste. I ordered the cauliflower lobster soup and cactus salad. My husband ordered the chicken with red pumpkin sauce. His dish was outstanding - which is why I rated this place 3 stars and not 1. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the sauce was flavorful and rich. My order was not so. The soup was cold and too thick and very bland. How do you make bland lobster anything?  The cactus salad had no flavor whatsoever. Suffice to say we will not be going back soon."}
{"text":"Very much an average place. Service is VERY lacking. When you pay a higher price for food you expect service and a staff that is knowledgeable and cares for their guests. I ordered a house margarita and it was good. Probably the best thing from my meal.

Let's digress a bit and walk through the experience. This restaurant is located in the quaint town of Davidson NC. Right across the street is Davidson College. Plenty of walk by traffic yet the restaurant has only 3 tables seated at 7pm on a Tuesday night. The staff seems to enjoy hanging out in the back of the restaurant next to the kitchen. They don't seem interested in mingling with their guests and or getting to know them. Upon entering I find a quaint contemporary styled restaurant with Edison lights hanging from the ceiling and tall Aztec wall art. The overall look is appealing.
After being set and waiting 5 minutes for a server to great me. I'm greated with \"what would you like besides water\". No suggestions or even a general inquiry if I had ever dined here before. I ordered a margarita and the timing for service of the drink was appropriate 2-3 min. The server asked \"what would I like to order \". No let me let you know about our specials or no suggestions for a wonderful dinner. Ugh.. This is heading south fairly quick.
After ordering, approximately 2-3 min and a basket of chips are brought out with a ramakin of salsa. The salsa was OK, didn't taste overly fresh and the chips were borderline store bought. Not fresh.
I ordered the Sabana, medium rare. When it came in 12 minutes, the plate presentation was nice, accompanied with a small ramakin of black beans with questions fresco, mashed potatoes and overcooked sauteed julian vegetables. The potatoes were luke warm and accompanying black beans the same. The Sabana was a undercooked rare+. Flavor profile was was OK, somewhat muted and not bright at all.
I was never asked if I would like a 2nd margarita since I had already finished my first before the meal was served. NO check back from server at all. Another server noticed my water was empty and refilled it. NO offering of dessert or after dinner livation.
Overall I probably will not return here. Mediocrity for an elevated price. $34 for 1 person."}
{"text":"Was not impressed.  Service was lacking. Food was bland and flavorless. Other people were brought chips on the table for free, we were not.  Small portion and left hungry. Had the fajitas   Was served in less than 4 minutes. Could never had cooked the food fresh that quickly.  Served the food first and waited for the condiments to make fajitas.  Felt rushed and was not crowded at the time. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Not a good first impression. We love Mexican food and La Unica is our local go to. We decided to try this place out at the last minute. The service is slow but polite. We ordered cheese dip to start and it was good but we didn't love the salsa. I had the steak and chicken fajitas which was a small portion. I prefer corn tortillas but wasn't offered an option and had flour ones. The pico side was minimal and the bean were awful. The meat had no taste. My boyfriend ordered a chicken dish that he was disappointed with. Small portion and the chicken was bland and fatty. $75 for the two of us: cheese dip, two entree and four beers."}
{"text":"I have come here before to eat in and ordered the steak fajitas which were delicious. Ordered to go a couple months later on the phone and told them my order and I was asked what kind of tortillas I wanted and I answered. Picked the food up brought it home to find no tortillas in the bag at all. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"A stylish restaurant that remains one of our favorites...a great fusion of traditional Mexican dishes with a contemporary twist.  We recently attended a special menu unveil dinner and we could not be more impressed with the flavorful additions to the menu.  Their new drink - the Paloma, is a tequila based cocktail mixed with grapefruit soda and lime.  Such a refreshing drink for the summer season!  I ordered their chile rellenos - Mestizo's newest version features ancho chiles stuffed with shrimp, filet mignon and potatoes.  It was amazing!  My husband had a pork rib and the meat was flavorful, tender with a wonderful smoky taste.  Mestizo continues to amaze us while raising the bar for restaurants in the Charlotte area.  Their service is without a doubt top notch - they make you feel like family.  A wonderful atmosphere as well that includes outdoor dining."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to dining here. What a perfect location, in the heart of Davidson. While my wife enjoyed a steak taco salad and the other patrons delighted at its presentation, I was disappointed by the shrimp and scallops. Seemed more like an appetizer than an entree. Perhaps a bit more of the rice and tasty sauce would not have broken the owner, but would have satisfied my appetite. 

Nice presentation, friendly young waiter, but it could have been a tad more filling."}
{"text":"House margarita very light on alcohol. Guacamole was very flavorful and ample quantity. I got the steak and shrimp fajitas. You get green peppers, onions, sour cream...sorta barebones as sides. For $17 I would have expected refried beans and/or rice like most Mexican restaurants do. Coconut shrimp was pretty good and comes with rice. Portion size is small, Kindred must be rubbing off on them. Service not as attentive as other Mexican restaurants like prickly Pear and La Unica.

All in all wife and I had two drinks each and a entree at $75. Don't think I will be dethroning La Unica as my Mexican restaurant of choice any time soon."}
{"text":"Not a fan.... The atmosphere is nice. The people we helpful and nice but I must say the prices are quite high for the area. We paid almost as much for a cup of queso and a cup of guacamole as we would a full sized entree and the salads were not plentiful either. Disappointed and will not be going back."}
{"text":"We loved the food and the service...killer sangria too! They were the only place in town open after a power failure and I'm glad they were! Really liked the meal and thought it was great value for the money. Fresh and tasty ingredients."}
{"text":"Came in for brunch the place is decorated very cute. Server was very nice. Food was excellent. Margaritas weren't good we had to try and doctor them. Very tart. First time mine was made wrong. Cute atmosphere tho."}
{"text":"Slightly upscale Mexican restaurant, limited space inside like many other Davidson restaurants are. Upon entering, beware that is very pricey. So I had very high expectations for the food & service. The menu was very interesting and different compared to other Mexican restaurants, which I love! I had the shrimp ala vanilla, the presentation was lovely. But the flavors were just ok. The rice was bland, and the sauce was more on the sweet side and so were the plantains which was overpowering. I tried some of the grilled salmon, and OH LORD IT WAS SOO SALTY. It wasn't even just a bit of salty which would be forgiving, but it was like HELLA salty to the point where we had to order extra tortillas and use the rice to tone it down. The manager and the staff were very friendly so I'm very disappointed!! Honestly for the price we paid ($20 and up) for each dish we expected a lot more!"}
{"text":"We love Mestizo. They have assorted dishes on their menu, the atmosphere is great, and the staff is excellent. We specially love how they share their Mexican culture through art, music and different holiday celebrations."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice. The first time was not long after they opened and I knew I wanted to give it another try. I was there for dinner with my son. I had fajitas and they were really disappointing. Vegetables not seared but sauteed and seemed reheated. We made a big deal about my son being allergic to wheat and were promised corn tortillas. But as he started (absentmindedly) to roll one of them, I said 'they look an awful lot like flour tortillas'. The waiter replaced them, but really....

The other day for lunch I ordered fire roasted enchiladas: spinach, tomato, corn, black beans, onions, huitlacoche, squash blossoms over Mexican rice (so reads the menu). I got corn, onions, carrots, huitlacoche, all sauteed, not roasted, and all pretty tasteless, as was the rice. I mentioned it to the waiter and he offered to bring me a side of black beans (but not graciously and only after double-checking the menu when I asked about all the missing ingredients). No apology or explanation. My colleague had fajitas and said they were only ok.  

The owner here is lovely,but the wait staff a lot less so. They've created a very attractive restaurant and I hope it gets better. But so far it's a major disappointment.  Given the attitude of the waiter toward what I probably should  have just sent back to the kitchen,  I'm encouraging others not to waste their time and money.

{"text":"I ordered the fish tacos with the fixings of the pork tacos. The fish tacos come with slaw and the pork with pineapple.. I like fruit with my fish tacos. They were delish."}
{"text":"We had a nice meal and experience at Mestizo. Our main complaint was that the quality and portion sizes of our meals were not worth the price tag. My fajita plate did not include rice, guac, lettuce or tomato (typical condiments to accompany fajitas) just a small cup of beans. It came with maybe 3 oz of chicken with very few grilled vegetables, which for what they charge is not adequate. We were also disappointed with the guacamole. \"Avocado Pico de Gallo\" is a more suitable name for the dip as it is heavy on the tomato and onion and light on the avocado. Additionally, when we tried to order we found out that they were out of multiple items listed on both the drink and food menus. Service and ambiance were nice for a family meal however considering my family has some big eaters I am not sure we will be returning unless the bill better reflects the quality and/or quantity of the food."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch. The waiter ,Oscar was very friendly and helpful. Let us know the specials, that every thing was made fresh and that the dinner menu was more involved. 
The food definitely tasted fresh. The guacamole was awesome. 
It was a little pricey for lunch but I will come back to try dinner because you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Visited for the second time and had an ok experience.  This was very different than my original visit.  The first time I had the pork shank and it was really good.  Also the service was exceptional.  Unfortunately this trip was different.  

I raved about Mestizo to my wife so I brought her to try it out.  Like I said this trip was much different.   Tonight I had the Lobster Paella Enchiladas and they were very good.  My wife had the shrimp fajitas and they were pretty bland (no seasoning on the shrimp).  

That was overlooked but our waiter was horrible.  I think that we saw him about three times during the meal (greeting, serving food and providing the check).  It was interesting because another person (who I think was the owner) refilled our drinks multiple times and inquired about our meal.  It floored me that our waiter was that inattentive (it wasn't that busy).  His name is Alonzo so if he is your waiter, move to someone else's section.  

I enjoyed the food and atmosphere but will make sure that next time I am not in his section."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see so many disappointed reviews! Yes, the price point is too high, but I've come to expect that when dining in Davidson. Mestizo is a very cute little restaurant with a great staff. The margaritas are excellent and they always offer great recommendations. I've had the fajitas many times. I've also ordered a Halibut special they had once and it was incredible. Great cut of fish and cooked perfectly. If you're entertaining out of town guests who say, \"how about Mexican?\" and you're looking for an nice atmosphere, don't count Mestizo out!"}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant with delicious plates and mouth watering margaritas!  Came here with a group of friends on a Saturday night and we had a wonderful experience.   Tried a few different flavors of their margaritas and each one was very good.  Our friend said his sangria was the best one he's ever had!  I ordered the steak fajitas and my husband got the tex style fajitas which had a little of everything.  When the food came out, we were expecting a couple of sizzling fajita plates, but they came out without a sizzle (but honestly, I prefer this as the steam can cause me to cough sometimes lol).  I ordered corn tortillas and was served flour, but I didn't ask to switch them out and they were great tortillas. My steak was perfect and all the sides made for an incredible meal. My husband was pleased with his dinner as well. Our server was very attentive and very friendly.  We never felt rushed and enjoyed our time there.  Prices are a little on the higher end, but with such great food, it makes for a special date night spot.  We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Tempted to give one star, but a disappointing restaurant in Davidson is better than another empty gnome storefront. With that said, I left this meal very unsatisfied.

I ordered a classic margarita ($8) and a steak ($22), and they both left quite a bit to be desired. The drink was weak. For $8 dollars, I'd expect what feels like a full serving of tequila. 

The steak was equally disappointing. Expecting a full cut of meat, I was served three or four lukewarm slices of steak with a drizzle of sauce, some cold mashed potatoes, and an assortment of vegetables that didn't add much to the meal. I left hungry and disappointed. 

The one advantage of such disappointing portion sizes is that the weak margarita actually accomplished the same as a stiff one would.

Quality and quantity aside, I need to address the lack of value here. I've had better, cheaper Mexican food and drink in Manhattan. This is North Carolina. The Taco truck at the gas station in Huntersville serves what seems like better food in larger portions for a third of my entree's cost. 

Mestizo has a ton of potential and is in a great location, but they need to deliver on the food and drink, their bread and butter, before I'll follow the other reviewers and comment on the quality of the interior decoration."}
{"text":"Sadly, I wasn't impressed.  I am not one to usually add salt to anything, but I added it to the tortilla chips and my meal.  I had the chicken & steak fajitas.  Everything tasted fresh, but the portions were tiny and the flavor was bland.  My friend asked for a quesadilla but without meat (which wasn't on the menu, but she wasn't eating meat), and that's exactly what she got - cheese melted between two tortillas.  No pico, no onions, no beans, nothing."}
{"text":"I went here but was nervous after the bad reviews. Is someone trying to sabotage this place? It was delicious! Everything was fresh, cooked perfectly and I even went back to try lunch another day as well. It too was delicious like my dinner the week before. I highly recommend the crab cakes, the shrimp cooked in potato flour and the fajitas. All were amazing. I shall be going back again."}
{"text":"Meh is the best word I can use to describe the restaurant overall.

I think the problem is your expectations are high because of the price point. The food is mediocre and very small portions. 

I got the lobster, scallop and shrimp enchilada. It had flavor but zero lobster and shrimp. It was filled with tomatoes, onions and two bites of scallops.

The servers were very friendly and the atmosphere was nice. 

I don't need to go back."}
{"text":"First time here tonight. Great ambiance and service. Handcrafted pineapple margaritas. 
Food was extremely good, with appealing presentations. 
Not your father's everyday black beans either. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Not good! Had such high hopes with a cute spot in Davidson and outdoor seating. Menu is way over priced for quality of food. 
Margaritas were not good, food not great and not cooked appropriately (ie steak fajitas served well done and no sizzling skillet). Once and done."}
{"text":"Great food and during. Sangria was good and the grouper special was delicious!  Second trip here and both were excellent. Open on Tuesday night in Davidson when many other good restaurants are closed. Do stop by!"}
{"text":"Decent atmosphere and friendly staff. I left a little disappointed in the taste and portions for the price. This was when they first opened so I am cutting them a little slack. It is only fair that I return to give them another shot. I'll let you know when that is."}
{"text":"Very delicious food and prices were not terrible. Margaritas are very delicious and reasonably priced. Its not a cheap mexican restaurant though so don't go in thinking of a chili's because the food is definitely more flavorful."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant in Davidson.  Food is bland, poorly executed and overpriced.  You pay $20 for an entrée and your tortillas come in a aluminum foil like at a $5 burrito place.  Cherry on cake: a bunch of flies incessantly trying to get in our food on the patio.  Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"Mestizo is an excellent dinner spot in a quaint location on Main Street in Davidson. The service was great and the fajitas were good as well. It was a quiet atmosphere on the Wednesday night we ate there. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Poor service, bad food not such a thing of contemporary Mexican food, had on menu callos de Hacha it is false advertising they had scallops no callos, fajitas where burnt , calamari no taste, soup was tasteless  just like water with chicken and the worst was the presentation very poor and oysters bad no flavor. 
Will not recommend and will not come back"}
{"text":"We had a great experience. I agree that it is a bit pricey, but the food was delicious.  I had the lobster enchiladas and my husband had the pork shank. Both dishes were prepared perfectly.  I do think the dishes are rather skimpy for the price, but I think we expect too much food on our plate in America and tend to eat way more than is healthy. The wait staff is superb. Friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. I would like to see a bit more in the way of sides added to the main dish, but we will be visiting again.  In fact, we have reservations for tonight!!"}
{"text":"A cute little place in the heart of Davidson. Went for lunch today and were seated promptly. Fresh chips and salsa came out and the salsa was delicious! I had the vegetarian enchiladas, my MIL had the chile rellenos, and my grandmother had the steak tacos- all came with rice and beans. You can tell they make everything from scratch there. The only thing keeping me from rating 5 is that the food took a really long time to come out and the young gentleman waiting on us, you could tell he was new- really awkward and quiet and not very attentive. I'm sure that will change with time. He also accidentally charges us dinner prices instead of lunch prices, which that was corrected. The three things we ordered would have been $57 (and we all had water to drink) so I know I will never be there for dinner- that's completely outrageous."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I'm giving this place 4 stars.... Mainly because my first trip for dinner ended with some lousy guacamole and chips. Last night a friend suggested we try mestizo for dinner.. I suggested plenty of other options but still ended up at Mestizo! Wow am I glad we returned and that I tried again! I had the salmon with a mole sauce and mashed potatoes--- holy smokes it was delicious!!  I believe my mistake was expecting Mexican food. If you're open to American food with a Mexican spice touch and vibe, then I think you should 100% give mestizo a try!!"}
{"text":"Really fresh ingredients made on the premises. I had shrimp tacos which had a flavorful spicy coleslaw sauce. Great guacamole."}
{"text":"This is a great place! Not your normal Tex mex joint! love the margaritas! Food is high class Mexican Fare! Very good! Love that it is close hy"}
{"text":"The food is so good but the service so so slow. Did we even have a waiter? Multiple people halfheartedly stopped by our table after we sat for 10-20 mins at a time waiting on everything. I felt like perhaps our presence was an inconvenience?"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to have lunch here for the first time. When we walked in we were sat, very beautiful on the inside. You can definitely tell it was organized. We ordered queso as an appetizer and it came out cold. The waitress took it back and heated it up, however it was still cold but we didn't complain we just ate it. We then ordered veggie fajitas and shrimp fajitas. When it came out there was no flavoring or seasoning and we both dove for the salt and pepper shakers. The black beans from the can weren't drained and were also cold. Up until then our waitress had been okay, however she never came to the table to ask how our food was. No one came and checked on the table until our plates were stacked and we were ready to go. It just sucks because we were expecting a lot more from this place, we both work in the service industry and probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food, and this place is not your typical Mexican restaurant. Mestizo offers a different twist on traditional favorites, and I really enjoyed the fact that I didn't need to blow my diet when I ate there! It was fairly empty when we stopped in for lunch on a Saturday and that surprised me given the area. the staff was friendly and attentive. I had a squash blossom quesadilla that was tasty and just the right amount of food. I look forward to going back for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Off to a bad start. Fajitas had burnt chicken. Not served on cast iron. No seasoning. Short ribs not bad. Service slow."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, but I came here since someone suggested it to me. It's right on the main street in Davidson, so the location is great. The staff was friendly. Overall, I just think it is too expensive for what it is. The food wasn't bad, but I'm not dying to go back. If you're looking to spend a day in Davidson, not a bad place to choose. They have a patio which is great for nice days."}
{"text":"yummy food in Downtown Davidson! Glad to have had dinner here and would come back due to quality of food being high and warmth of owners and staff!"}
