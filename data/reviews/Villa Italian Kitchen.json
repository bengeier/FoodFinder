{"text":"So when it comes to fast food pizza. Villa or via is in most of the malls and everything looks amazing butt taste was not the best. The one thing I do love to eat there is the stuffed pizza. I get an all-meat one with everything inside and dipping sauce on the side. If you are feeling like you want something not healthy or just in the mood for Italian food and her shopping in the mall then this is a quick fix for you. but I would not compare it to authentic pizza restaurants."}
{"text":"Avoid this plaw at all costs.  The pizza is like cardboard covered in string cheese it was reheated to serve and burnt... and the service is horrible.  Who walks away right in the middle of taking an order to answer a phone call?!?  And then the guy that came out of the back gave me attitude because I he barely spoke English and couldn't understand me when I was forced to repeat my order.  GET YOUR STORE IN CHECK MANAGEMENT!"}
{"text":"Was not too impressed with this place. Pizza did taste good but it was room temperature. Unsure if it was because of it not being put back in the oven long enough or the what seems like an overly long wait to pay for my meal.   I also ordered a chicken Caesar salad for a side and it was again alright.  Dressing was good and lettuce was crisp but what ruined it for me was the fact that the croutons were soggy.   Overall I would not go back again"}
{"text":"Soggy garlic bread. Cold meatballs. Fried chicken wings. Only thing Italian about this place is it's name."}
{"text":"Came here for the buffet thing they had on Tuesdays 4-9pm. I actually had high hopes because it looked great. Tables clean and everything. Went through the line and got my food. Some things had to be reheated which was understandable. Then they got to the side dishes. I got meatballs and some mac and cheese and they reheated it in a microwave. Why heat my main dish in an oven but microwave my sides? I was off put but still went through the line and sat down. Even with the very unfriendly Hispanic staff. Everything I ate was so greasy I got sick halfway though my first plate and most of it even cold. The canned mushrooms, and canned spinach on the pizza was the worst. The most sickeningly greasy mediocre food I've ever had. Ate here once and never again."}
{"text":"The prices are outrageous. Paying almost $10 for the combo is not worth it. The pizza crust and the sauce are bad, and their choices for sides are not that great either. Plus, you need to pay Â¢75 for a refill. You are better off eating pizza from the frozen aisle of your local supermarket."}
{"text":"No star for this food court eating. This place is the worst. Food is micovawe and mostly old and over cook. Prices are outrageous. Small spaghetti  ( less than 2 Oz noodles $ 4. 25 , if you get meatball you pay and additional $1.75).  1slice of pizza $4.25 plus $1.25 per topping , food needs to be micovawe after putting in the micovawe the food was not warm.  The food did not taste that good and would not recommend it. For 1slice and small spaghetti side I end paying $17.00. Horrible for a food court food."}
{"text":"Stromboli of the pepperoni kind, YUM! Service was also great! At the time we were there they were out of stromboli so the chef whipped one up real fast for me."}
{"text":"Friendly and very helpful, I couldn't really decide with only one grandchild out of 5 wanting pizza and the rest saying I'm not hungry what to get. She suggested I get the pizza and two sides special for 19.99 wish I would have.  I went with pizza only for 14.99. Time to pick up 15 minutes later my 2 year old grand daughter is hungry she wants Mac/Cheese that cost additional 4.00.... Oops!!! I should of listened Lol. Well kids ate it all the large cheese pizza and the baby she loved the mac& cheese. Great that you can bring this into the bowling alley!!"}
{"text":"Employees don't care about service at all. I was served a cold slice,  I asked about getting it reheated and the employee didn't want to do it. Pasta was barely warm. For the price, I expect them to at least serve the food warm"}
{"text":"Looks good, thats about it.   Food is overpriced, i ordered Pizza, Spaghetti and meatballs, and a side of Macarroni, all of it lacked taste. Would not recommend this place and I certainly will not eat here again."}
{"text":"This is a pre-prepared type of food place.  I got the lasagna and a side of potatoes that were tossed in the microwave and my wife got pizza and bread.  The pizza was placed in the pizza oven to warm it and the bread went into the microwave.  It had a good taste but my food was pretty cool in spots.  I would say it is better tasting than the usual chain pizza places found in the food courts.  It served its purpose but nothing more!"}
{"text":"This place has got to have THE.  WORST.  PIZZA. EVER.  It was tissue paper thin and absolutely dripping with grease from the pepperoni.  I was already at Santa Fe Casino so thought I'd give them a try.  I will be speaking to the Manager of the casino to ask him if he as actually tried this place as all the other restaurants are very good in Santa Fe.  Don't try Villa Pizza....save yourself!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would.  I was recently here and ordered the spaghetti and meatball, a garlic knot, and mozzerella sticks.   While waiting for my food I noticed that everything is being microwaved...In microwaves hidden underneath the counter on the floor..  I understand other fast food places also nuke their food. But it's not so blatantly obvious, and it's also nuked well. Which my food was not.  I was handed my food, everything was room temp, except the mozzerella sticks which felt like they were pulled right from the fridge.   The garlic knot ended up being the only edible thing I ordered.  The spaghetti was horrible, it smelled and tasted rancid, and I even got a few more opinions from friends. And I think the meat in the meatball had gone bad.  My mozerella sticks were still barely warm after having them re \"cook\" them.  And we're absolutely horrible. If I wanted string cheese dipped in bread crumbs I would have ordered that.    I'm over all really disappointed with this place.  And I'm not usually that picky about food. But I literally was only able to eat one item that I ordered. And the whole ordered cost me 15 bucks. It was a small order of everything..."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here with all the staff and food today 10/23/17(4:00pm) all very polite"}
{"text":"Meh is a perfect description of this place. They come and do a pop-up at my office building and it tastes exactly like cheap school cafeteria food. Sauce is bland and watery. Noodles are a bit overcooked but I can forgive that since it is a pop-up. Garlic rolls are alright. I've grabbed food here when it's at my building because it's convenient but I could never see myself actively choosing to eat here. $7.50 for plain spaghetti with marinara sauce that was less impressive than many canned sauces I've tried just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"A \"neo\" pizza is cheese OR pepperoni. \"With any toppings\" included ANY toppings. They are charging the toppings as an extra $2.50 each. Pretty misleading sign and employees need to learn what their sign is \"selling\"."}
{"text":"This was the best pizza I've ever had in my life! Like usually I get cheap pizza and all that but oh my god this was amazing!!!! It was so cheesy and big and the crust was a delight as soon as you bit into it, can t wait to go back one day: )"}
{"text":"Last time I was in town, we arrived early at the airport and were looking for something for breakfast. Chick-fil-A wasn't open yet so we settled on a burrito joint that was horrible! Only after that did we realize that Villa Italian Kitchen had breakfast Stromboli! Dang!! We should have looked more. Regardless now I'm back and after snubbing my nose at the awful burrito place and knowing I can get Chick-fil-A anywhere, I decided on Villa and the breakfast Stromboli. Am I glad I did!! I ordered the egg, pepper, onion and mushroom Stromboli and it was just awesome!! They heated it up for me and it was so delicious that I'm tempted to grab another one! But, having lost 138 pounds on weight watchers, I stuck to one. Well YUMMY is all I can say. I travel back and forth to Pittsburgh a lot and will definitely choose Villa every single time. Kudos to a job very well done!!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely poor service didn't listen didn't get my bacon and no smiles at 6 AM in the morning poor poor service"}
{"text":"Sometimes we forget that our reviews directly effect those businesses.  I'm not suggesting that we should go soft, but in coming here I found a small Mom & Pop setup that is still trying to find their way.  This Food Court is new, and there are only three options as of this writting.  To say that Villa Italian Kitchen is not as good as Sbarro is an understatement. I'm not a big fan of watching employees microwave food to be served.  But in watching them closely, you could see they were on a steep learning curve and should be cut some slack.  Well, at least I have for now.  Until next time then."}
{"text":"I arrived at the Pittsburgh Airport a tad bit hungry and didn't know what I wanted to eat. I walked passed Villa Italian Kitchen and the pizza looked real tasty. I hadn't had pizza in awhile so decided pizza would be a good choice. The first bite and all the bites after it were yummy. It was hot and fresh. The crust was really good and it had a nice amount of cheese on it. I was quite pleased."}
{"text":"Just made me say, eh. It wasn't very good. The meatball must have been frozen prior to being heated up. The sauce was watery. The quality lacked. But what can you expect from a mall restaurant. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Normally, I don't rate food court spots. It's food court pizza, pasta and salad. So don't expect more than that. What made Villa pizza stand out was the exceptional service provided. 5 stars for the young man who went out of his way to make my family and I feel important. :)"}
{"text":"Never have I had airport food so good! Well I have once but this pasta with meat sauce and garlic bread was just what I need before heading back towards California! The cashiers were super funny and polite and Tony the cook made us fresh past with a smile!  Counter area was clean which is a most for me including service area as well!   I wish that I could have remembered the older ladies names and the pregnant young lady as well but because they made my food as I created it I gave the all a $5.00 tip just because!!  I'm pretty easy to satisfy but I demand great service always or I can take my money  somewhere else!  Thanks ladies for making me day!!!"}
{"text":"So for what we got and what we paid and waited for sucked the noodles are cooked then thrown in a microwave when you order which if u have cooked what happens to noodles in the microwave if u don't know try it and taste it just gross this place should be checked out in my opinion over priced for microwaved noodles"}
{"text":"If zero stars were an option, this place would be a candidate. Absolutely the worst pizza at the most ridiculous prices ever. Cafeteria line, overheated, dry, cardboard pizza. Institutional, long lines at lunch time and NOT worth the time or effort. If you need a baseline for the worst pizza experience anywhere, one that makes Domino's or Pizza Hut taste like your favorite NY or Chicago neighborhood joint, try it. Otherwise, any frozen pizza in the grocery store is faster better and cheaper. Truly awful. And I'm trying to be objective and nice."}
{"text":"Service was soooooo slow. Watching the staff was like watching the keystone cops.  I kept waiting for them to bump into each other and drop Pizza on the floor. Just because I didn't see it, doesn't mean it doesn't happen!"}
{"text":"Super unorganized. I don't understand how someone can screw up an order when you're literally pointing out the food you want. Not sure how hard it is to understand two pieces of pepperoni and sausage and one piece of cheese. If the person has a hard time hearing or understanding, ask for clarification. I repeated the order twice. He still got it wrong. Not from the area so probably won't be back - even if I am in the neighborhood again.   The food was mediocre, but the crust had nice flavor and chew so it gets 2 stars instead of one."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now. The combo is decent tasting although pricey at $10 BUT the real insult is that my lunch hour is at 10 and every single time I have come here I am told around 10:15 the spaghetti isn't ready and it'll be 15 mins. It should already be made at opening not me having to wait until 10:30 to get what I want. Second, each time I'm told it's not ready in a manner like go away, no offer of a time frame until I ask and say I'll wait. Today the employee actually seemed annoyed. Time for the owner to step up and make some changes. Otherwise I won't be back."}
{"text":"Not good. Agree with the Costco comment, you can get better quality pizza there with MUCH better service. Overpriced, bad food and poor service, even for an outlet mall food court. PASS."}
{"text":"Airlines canceled our flight and dropped us at a hotel across the street with food vouchers. These guys were super! Took our vouchers AND make a pretty good pizza! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"The food is expensive and extremely poor quality.  I was hungry I couldn't even finish my plate because it was just gross. The lady attending us gave my mom attitude when she asked her why she was over charging me. Maybe they were having an off day but everyone looked like they were in annoyed. I really hate giving bad reviews but this place is just terrible. I could have ordered some where with better quality food but like I said I was super hungry."}
{"text":"This pizza is delicious!! Thin and crispy crust but sort of soft and chewy top. The Alfredo sauce pizza is our favorite! Maybe the best pizza I've had to date. The salad dressing (balsamic) with the side salad was incredible! Had feta, Kalamata olives, red onions, tomatoes, cucumbers. We also had a slice of the cheese pizza with tomato sauce. Very pleased with the service too. The young Saturday night shift guy who helped us asked if we had any questions and was very pleasant. Two pieces of pizza, a lemonade and a salad came to only $12. We will be back for sure! Thanks guys."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here and my last. The service sucks. They have about 3 people helping you through the line. They ask what you want and just say ok without any direction. I'm still not sure if they're supposed to call out your name or your order.   I brought my nephew in for a slice of cheese pizza. Which is already made they just warm it up like they do all the other places that sell by the slice.   After 15 mins, and watching whole pies roll out to customers I go and ask about my slice. They girl said nothing, just turned around got a slice out of their oven/warmer whatever it is, hands it to me and says \"here you go'. That is all. No, sorry about the wait, or sorry about the mix-up or whatever.   You guys sucks at customer service. And it wasn't just me. I could tell by the way you guys responded to the person in front of me as well.   Pizza was good, but not good enough to come back and ignore the careless employees."}
{"text":"I visited their location in Arizona Mills Mall and the service was ridiculous. I stood in line for 5 minutes waiting for someone to even take my order then after that I stood in line another 10 minutes waiting to check out and pay for my food. Needless to say I became so annoyed and upset by the slowfulness they demonstrated with their customers that I happily gave them back their slice of pizza and told them that they could have it because I no longer wanted it. So if you desire to wait in line and then wait in line some more just to eat at what is suppose to be fast food then I suggest you visit this place. Sorry I couldn't give a review on the actual food since I didn't eat there.  I hope this was helpful to someone."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and the mac n cheese is great. The have a freat costumer service. Definitely one of my favorite pizza joint I have ever tried."}
{"text":"I had the Zitti. It was very watery and wasn't very flavorful. It was definitely blan and lacking flavor. Did I mention it had no flavor. I couldn't even finish it. The cheese and pepperoni pizza seemed to be ok. No complaints from the kiddos. If I went back I would definitely try something else, so I wouldn't recommend that dish to anyone because yes, it had ZERO flavor. STEP YO' SPICE GAME UP!"}
{"text":"Waiting at the Pittsburgh airport & was drawn to VIK because everything looked super fresh & the gentleman behind the counter was hand tossing pizza dough in the air & asking me at the same time what I would like to have! Well, after selecting the combo pizza(pepperoni, Italian sausage, bell peppers & mushrooms, I scarfed it up. It was very fresh. Glad I picked Villa Italian Kitchen to grab something to eat, while at the Pittsburgh airport."}
{"text":"The employee that served us was new but very personable.  He kept us entertained while he got answers to his questions.  Great service.  The food was great!  I was skeptical at first because normally mall food court Italian locations are not the greatest but I was pleasantly surprised.  The portions were fitting for the price and I took advantage of a meal promo that helped the price even more.   I am traveling on business and if I return to this location I will eat here again.  I have recommended this location to the employees I know in this mall."}
{"text":"I ordered the Triple Play, which includes spaghetti w/ meatballs, salad, and garlic knot.  I arrived there at 12:15 and they had no spaghetti noodles prepared...huh?  They told me it would be a 5 minute wait but it turned out to be 15 minutes, much longer than I would want to wait at a food court.  They offered nothing as consolation for my longer than expected wait.  The salad was packed in the same to-go box as the spaghetti, which I really hate.  This always results in spaghetti sauce getting in the salad and dressing getting in the spaghetti....disgusting.  I asked for a separate bowl for the salad so I could separate it, so I was saved this time.  The garlic knot was very small.  Had to order a second one, which for some reason seemed to annoy the cashier.  The food was decent.  Everything was fresh and tasted fine....about what you would expect from food court italian food.  Based on the food, I would give a 3 or 3.5 rating, but because of the long wait, single-box packaging, and sad garlic knot, I give it only 2 stars."}
{"text":"Since one doesn't come up for AZ Mills I'm putting it here. $10 for pasta with meatballs and a drink. Than they have the nerve to charge 75 cents for a refill. When everyone else gives you a free one. The girl at the register had the nerve to tell me to go next door and use the burger places one are you f-ing kidding me? Joke!"}
{"text":"The pasta seems old like its been cooked last night and just reheated. if youre too tired and hungry the pizza is ok. They have nice crew"}
{"text":"I ordered a stromboli that they heated in the oven. as i started to eat it, the filling was cold so I told the staff. instead of sticking it back in the oven they put it in a microwave. the stromboli filling came out over heated and the crust hard and chewy. TERRIBLE SERVICE!"}
{"text":"November 10, 2017 Friday - 2:30 PM for a snack 1 Adult  Atmosphere - 4 stars Food - 4 stars Service - 4 stars  Background - I needed some food before I become Hangry!  Atmosphere - It is the outlet malls food court.  Nothing to fancy here.  The place was actually packed.  Food   Snack -The pizza slices are in the display window partially cooked.  So that is the only thing you can order pizza wise.  I was watching and hoping for that last slice of pepperoni to make till I was next in line.  A slice of pepperoni pizza please.  They place your slice back in the oven to warm it up to temp that burns you mouth on that first bite.    Service - It is a fast food pizza joint, the staff was polite.  I got what I needed from them.  Future - If I had to use the food court again I would pick this place."}
{"text":"Place isn't great at all, the veggie pizza is thumbs down hands down... Go to Costco!"}
