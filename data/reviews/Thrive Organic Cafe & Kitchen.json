{"text":"I love vegetarian super healthy food but it is hard to find great place. We accidentally found Thrive Organic with my friend. I was mind blown with how tasty everything was for the price they charge. We had wraps and it was so delicious. I love the fact that I don't have to be conscious of the content of each dish because everything is healthy. Their raw food desserts are wonderful too. It is pricey but enough for 3 people, because they are very rich with nut content. I wouldn't finish it myself. Too bad I live up north because I'm craving to go to this place!"}
{"text":"Exactly what a vegan restaurant should be. Plus organic!!! I've eaten here (and the Etobicoke site) four times, ordering bowls, soups, salads, and desserts. Large fresh portions in clean wholesome setting. Original vegan food conscious of nutrition and the environment. Service first-class and, because of the portions AND being organic, well worth the cost. Unlike Awai, with small portions and not organic."}
{"text":"So HAPPY Thrive organic opened up on College St , and especially close to me, I was talking to the owner and he  explained to me the importance of the quality of the organic food they purchase and always making sure it is fresh. Great atmosphere,clean,tasty and the service was great. I will be a regular."}
{"text":"I am so happy to be the first one writing a review for this fabulous and superbe place.
Very simple design and bright with a white concept and wooden table who gives you a feeling of clean and serenity.
Staff is super smiling and available.
You seat, look at your menu and then you order at the counter.
We were ordering gluten free bun for John's burger and when I looked at the display, surprisedly, I noticed that it was overcharged for the gluten free bread. So I asked the cashier about, and she said that they ever charged for gluten free option or substitution!! THIS IS AMAZING  I said and I already love this place!
I ordered a bowl and believe me is huge and generous. Very well done and executed.
About the burger, patty wasn't the best, was a bit over moisture. Need an improvement like sweet potato or lentil or black bean to dry it out.
Same thing with tacos.. sorry but I want to be honest and let you get better. Isn't a critic.
We finished with a raw dessert which it was super yummy. The only comment is about using for garnish a old and dried peppermint leaf who didn't reflect the picture on the menu and more over isn't nice to see it.
Overall, nothing wrong or bad. The food quality is superbe. Staff is very gentle and friendly. Price is very reasonable. I'll be back often and very soon."}
{"text":"What I love most about Toronto (topping a long list of things) is taking a new route to a familiar place, looking up and thinking, \"Hey, what's this place?\" Then discovering the most badass lunch bowl I've had in ages; the giant cornucopia of good things that I've always wished were available. Taking a recommendation from the amazing cashier, I got the Powerhouse Bowl (arugula, carrots, chic peas, tempeh bacon, sweet potato, avocado and sunflower sprouts.) For the carb I chose brown rice,  which is good, but next time will opt for soba noodle and bring my guy so we can share, because for $15 this is way too huge to finish on my own. I also got a Tonica Peach kombucha which is stunning, like fresh peaches got it on with a shandy. Much too delicious to be as healthy as it is. Plus I see from the table cards that Thrive offers a bunch of vegan desserts, like chocolate raspberry mousse, mango cashew cake and macadamia nut tiramisu. Totally going to get a Black Forest Cake for tonight's dinner party with dairy-allergic friends. UH OH! Time for an update about why they lost my stars... My love affair with this place stalled out tonight when I got take away food for the first time. I tried to check the order before I left but was adamantly told it was 'all there'. When I got home all three things were messed up: the bowl seemed a lot smaller than what you get in-house and there was no sauce (dry noodles = no fun), the dessert was missing (apparently they didn't put it in the bag), and they gave me the wrong soup. They weren't great about offering to fix these problems either. Bummer."}
{"text":"Was eager to give this place a try, so my hubby and I went on Tuesday evening. The layout is clean and bright, and menu is attractive.I got the Thrive burger and side of ceaser and my husband got the pizza (with real cheese). My burger was ok, but the garnish was meagre and the salad was too heavy on the coconut which made for a weird taste profile for a Ceasar Salad. His pizza on the other hand was absolutely delicious. Mixed bag for sure, and the price is on the high side- which is reasonable for quality ingredients.... I just wished there is more attention to detail for this price.

I will give this restaurant another try...the breakfast menu looks intriguing. To be continued...."}
{"text":"It was a healthy option with fresh ingredients and friendly service. Relative to the other healthy options, It was reasonable value. It's hard to find healthy food with decent taste."}
{"text":"Went on a rainy weekend, really enjoyed the experience!  The service was fast and friendly, and the food was fantastic!  I got the breakfast platter and the pancakes were amazing!  Would definitely return again."}
{"text":"So, like, I went to Thrive and I got one of their bowls.  The problem is I got one of their bowls and I ate it - well, I ate part of it because my problem is I have a small stomach so I can't eat it all at once but that's not really the issue.  I just find it's not filling 'cause it's all just vegetable, kale.  I had that freekeh stuff, which is good but it just wasn't filling.  Like with tax it was $17.00.  I wanted to get the one that Karen gets but I couldn't determine which one that is.  So now I want frozen yogurt just for the filing.  It's just like lacking zing as well."}
{"text":"We came on a super cold heavy snow weekday. The place is spacious and cozy and have a good selection of hot food to warm us up! My friend had the daily soup, which is tomato soup with a small serving of sprouted bread on the side, also a veggie burger. Our cashier recommended the power house bowl out of the four bowls on the menu, and I was not disappointed. The bowl was substantial in volume! The only downside is that I expected my sweet potato to be warm but it was very cold. So that doesn't do too well on a heavy snow day!

We both loved the pumpkin spice cake. The serving is individual size and costs 10 dollars, which is quite pricey even for gourmet individual cake. But it blew our mind. We loved everything about the cake! It's like pumpkin spice latte in cake form with mashed taro textured yummy vegan cream on top!"}
{"text":"Amazing time at thrive with my husband!  Today marked our first adventure to college street this far west!!! F. Yes this place is now at the top of my Ontario list. Walk north a bit from k market and make your day that much better  pesto kale pizza so amazing! Thank you."}
{"text":"Really did not like this spot, but really wanted to. The wrap that I had tasted like it was just ketchup and lettuce. The sauces they used caused the wrap to be wet when I got home to open it. It did not taste fresh."}
{"text":"Looking out on both College Street and Lippincott Streets the place features a long bar on the western wall that leads into a kitchen in the back. The decor is light and airy with a selection of tables that face the windows on Lippincott Street and barstools that look onto College Street. Following in the tradition of Fresh, probably Toronto's oldest plant based restaurant, these places always feature a lot of staff, that always seem to be busy doing something that never results in fast service. It seems the staff in these places, across the city, are not trained how to handle more than one customer at a time, resulting in really slow service. This place was no exception, they were even slower than Starbuck's which says a lot. At the same time, all these places charge a premium for their products, because they are all artisanlly made using obscure products farmed under special conditions that are way too precious. I guess the clientele who support these businesses have a lot more disposable income than we do, and certainly a great deal more patience."}
