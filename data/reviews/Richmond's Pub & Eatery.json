{"text":"Wings were piping hot which I love! We had the Memphis rub and hot-teriyaki. Really enjoy both flavours. I was happy with our server at first things quickly went down hill. She removed all of our plates and utensils and we wanted to order more wings. Then we thought maybe we would get yam fries. She took forever to come back our way she only ever asked us if we wanted more drinks.   After she took away everything from our table we decided to leave as that was a signal to us we ought to go. She never stopped by long enough to take another food order as we were usually face full of wings. The music is also a bit loud for my taste. It's not bad but it drowns everything out. I could not hear my brother who was sitting across from me and I have excellent hearing!   Service was meh last time I came too. I get that's it's busy but they only care about people ordering alcoholic drinks. I had one beer as I was driving but she didn't come back after I ordered an iced tea and water.  The table next to us ordering shots got all of her attention. 25 cent wings every Tuesday Coors on special."}
{"text":"Because I live near by I have been here a few times... the wings are great... the service is horrible. The wine is terrible. The manager would not give me and my friends the time of day to listen to our concerns about bad service we received from our blonde bimbo server and the steak which was supposed to be medium... was very rare.. he didn't give a discount or replace it and he was very rude... he obviously didn't give a crap. Then to top it off after I paid my bill... he chased after me thinking I didn't pay, and made me walk back in to prove I paid...humiliating? yep.. and by the way if your a girl you can expect sh** service from a server named larissa, if your a guy she will give you extra extra attention and actually look you in the eye. Just my observation! If the staff were not so rude and retarded I might have actually gone back. OHHH and make sure to check your limes and lemons... both mine and my friends limes were gross, dried up, and one was even BROWN!!! When I asked to have fresh ones cut the waitress (larissa) said \"maybe\".... every time I ask this poor excuse for a server anything its like pulling teeth... biaatch.. do your job! Last thing.. they use tomato juice instead of clamatto juice in their caesars... lame."}
{"text":"If it's summertime, you're in the southwest, and you wanna toss back a few beers on a patio somewhere, than this is one of the bigger somewhere's to do it.  That's the upside. The downside, I suppose, is that the patio is located in a strip mall parking lot with a view of Richmond Road and Safeway. Less than ideal.  However, if you just keep your eyes on the sky, all is well. And the place is big enough that you're almost always assured of getting a table.  Inside the pub they have a couple of pool tables, tons of VLTs, and lots of table and booth seating for people taking advantage of their full service kitchen. On weekends, Richmond's features live local bands, and Saturdays are Ladies Night, with $3 cocktails until 10pm.  So, if Richmond's is in your neck of the woods, you could do worse than this place!"}
{"text":"Service was a little sluggish on the two occasions visiting, one was during the dinner rush but the other was during a quiet afternoon.  Foodwise, the fries are fantastic! They serve the shoestring fries with their meals, much nicer than steakhouse fries in this humble Brit's opinion.  On the first visit, I ordered a Burger. Give them a miss if you don't like overly juicy burgers that are overpowered by red onions (Blimey, My breath STANK after that!)  Second visit I ordered the Pizza that I've heard a lot about. BIG Improvement, very fresh (albeit greasy), had to take some home as it was a generous serving and let me tell you, that Pizza still tasted blooming marvellous cold.   All in all the wait staff seem somewhat rushed all the time, but the atmosphere and the pizzas make it an adequate experience."}
{"text":"My new favourite pub a couple of KMs from my house.  I find the service always excellent and the food very good as well.  Has a real local feel to it and Fridays are always packed.  If you're into sports, no shortage of TVs and events on the go.also great night for UFC when its on."}
{"text":"After coming here with a group of friends, I asked the server what I might be able to order as I have Celiac disease, which highly restricts the items I can eat. I asked if there was a possibility I could order the wings baked so as to not have them in the fryer, which would also make me sick. She stated that she would check with the kitchen to determine if this was possible as according to her, \"we don't do that.\" When she returned (about ten minutes later), she informed me that it would take between 45 minutes to bake the wings! I have had baked wings at many other restaurants and they have brought my food out without an extra wait and with my company's food, plus it was a Sunday afternoon and the place was near empty. She stated loudly to my table of six that she hoped the kitchen doesn't \"make everybody else wait on your wings\" and that their food would be \"cold by then.\" She then emphasized that I should know that the kitchen is making this one-time adjustment and that this will \"never happen again.\" She is right, we it will never happen again as we are never returning to this pub. At that time, we were returning customers, but we will no longer be as we were so obviously unwelcome. I am truly disappointed in Richmond's Pub & Eatery."}
{"text":"Great Tuesday night wings!! Memphis rub and lemon pepper - can't go wrong. Pair it up with happy hour prices makes a great stop after work on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"We go here all the time. The food is good pub food! I especially like the Dragon Bowl, Gordie Howe pizza and BBQ Bison burger. Great yam fries. The servers are good, nice and polite (I find pub service to be slow in general but these ladies have stepped it up!) It's not the best decor, a bit dark and dingy but hey its a pub. The atmosphere is totally casual, even when we have gone when there is a game on its pretty chill and relaxed."}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere, our server was attentive and polite. Great place to watch a game and hang out with the boys."}
{"text":"We were really happy with all of our choices at this pub. Food was good. Service was good. Would recommend and go back!"}
{"text":"Great pub!  Accomodating for big groups, and easy to grab a table for a few people. Although it is often busy because it is a very popular place.  Very sports oriented, fills up quickly on game nights for sure, and once I've even been charged cover to get in on a game night- which I'm not a fan of doing when I want to grab a drink or two, no thanks to paying $20 for 2 drinks.  Good quality food, and great people. As n both the crowd it attracts to this venue, and the staff. Very friendly and great service."}
{"text":"Great food large room real great staff When we arrived the manger was out cleaning up the parking lot  Look good when there is team work"}
{"text":"Popped in weekday for a pint and snack - it was pretty busy for 9pm on a Thursday night!  Wings were excellent and the service was great but the on tap beer selection slightly lacked.  Nothing overwhelming or special about the menu - typical pub fare.  Lots of TV's for sporting events and they even indulged us and switched on to the Giro D'Italia coverage."}
{"text":"Overall, I'd have to say that the only way I'd ever come back would strictly be for drinks.  My friend and I were there late on a Sunday night. It was fairly empty, and there were two servers on. The place was absolutely freezing (it hadn't been that warm outside that day). The special for Sundays was a poutine menu, and poutine is a definite love of mine. I was definitely looking forward to it.  Unfortunately, our server forgot the poutine menu, and basically left us to our own devices after we got our food, never coming by to check and see if we needed beverage refills, or inquiring how the food was.  I had gotten a Butter Chicken poutine, and was expecting an amazing mix of curry, chicken, and the traditional aspects of poutine (cheese, gravy, and fries). What I got were four small pieces of chicken that I had to hunt for, and overcooked fries (some of them were burned). The sauce and the cheese was great, however.  Between the level of service received and the quality of food, the only way I'd come back is for drinks, and I'd be sitting at the bar where I could just converse with the bartender about what drink I'd like next."}
{"text":"Great for coming in and having a simple meal with the game on.  My favorite is the half order of baked lasagna for $9 but does not seem like a half order at all.  Cheese is no skimped!  Boyfriend loves the french onion soup. And sometimes we split a pizza, the Rocky Balboa and Pulled Pork pizzas are really good.  The specials that you see on the board and the website aren't always right though.  There's a couple days that are switched around, make sure to ask the waitress what's going on that night.  The waitresses are usually prompt and attentive.  We even got the big screen changed to the Barrett Jackson Auto auction when no one was watching anything one weekend.  Whole wall of VLTs that make interesting sounds once in a while.  Usually has a lot of party reservations in the back, but if the party is late they clear the tables fast.  Last visit unfortunately witnessed a group that had one underager that was asked politely to leave, when she tried to argue the manager was still polite but had to explain the fine in a louder voice."}
{"text":"This place probably deserves a higher rating, but it's just an average pub and really not close to much. We came here to see my friends band play.   Service was good, which was impressive for being during a show and late at night. I had ordered potato skins, as it's the one thing I can eat at a pub. They were decent, but they try and do theirs like a taco...I'm a simple gal, bacon bits, cheese and chives, not taco beef, jalepenos, red peppers and salsa.   None the less, it is a good venue, they have VLTs, pool tables, patio and lots of space inside. Good for live music, or a casual drink with friends."}
{"text":"Great pub! Our go to place for happy hour! Staff is awesome. Food is always good. Rush Hour menu is unique and perfect size for snacks! My husband loves the pizza!"}
{"text":"Yah they have a good patio and really good sweet potato fries. If its nice and and its late afternoon the patio is really good. Good place to watch UFC as well."}
{"text":"Great food and nice pub. 9 out of 10 times the service is excellent. Love the French onion soup and chicken wings and the onion rings with the chipotle mayo yummy."}
{"text":"I really like this bar. It's not pretentious or trying to be something that it's not. It's a bar with drinks and good food. It's big! Lots of tv's for sports, wall of VLT's for those that like to gamble and live music almost every weekend. My husband and I like to come here for a Saturday bevie and a snack. Always have had good service. Their pizza is delish! And they have these house made toquitos...mmmmm! Try them! Booked a table for 20 for my stagette here as well a while back. It's right close to the bowling alley and a Safeway. Good food, good booze, good service = my kinda pub.   They recently renovated this place and it looks great!!"}
{"text":"Draft beer is always flat. Food is hit and miss. Could do with a good clean. Plenty of TVs."}
{"text":"Brutal service and horrible food. This place is dark for a reason -- dirty throughout. I WILL NEVER GO BACK"}
{"text":"This is one of those reviews where I wish I could give half stars, because my experience was a three star whereas my dining companion's experience was a two.   So, I'll give it 3, based on my meal.  The place was pretty empty late on a Sunday night when we dropped by. We noticed right away that it was COLD inside. They seemed to be running the a/c despite the fact it wasn't very warm outside.  The server was nice enough, but forgot to bring us the special Sunday poutine menu, and all but abandoned us towards the end of the meal when we wanted to pay and leave.  I ordered the greek chicken wrap.  The wrap itself was good, but the potato chips tasted a little burnt and were not altogether too tasty.   On the other side of the table, the poutine was a little lackluster, and the \"chicken\" element of the Butter Chicken was missing (i.e. only 4 small pieces were found). The fries were also a little disappointing, which is one of the most important parts of a poutine.  Since I live so close, I'll likely be back, but Richmond's isn't necessarily a go-to place for me."}
{"text":"The place was packed while we were here for their annual Christmas customer appreciation night. This is the second year we have gone.   Last year must have been less known as I recall it being less busy and easier to enjoy the festive music and conversion with your table mates.   It's was pretty fun though. It was very loud and hard to converse this year. They offered a free beverage and appetizer to all guests plus a round of shots. I don't know of too many establishments that go out of their way to put on an event like this for anyone who comes in.   The service was on point and friendly considering how busy it was, I was impressed.   Of the few times I've been here I've really only been able to try the beer and a couple appetizers, which for pub food are decent. Today we tried a platter which was filling for our table of 3, considering they also brought as a second platter assortment on the house. It was heavy food though and we ended up ordering a plate of veggies to offset our guilt of all the greasy food we ate.   They have all daily specials and happy hour from 3-6pm other than  on Wednesdays and Saturdays which happy our runs from 3 until close.   From outside it doesn't look like much of a place, but it's modern on the inside."}
{"text":"Richmond's is a local favourite that has been renovated into a lively sports bar with great food and service. Favourite dish? The Chorizo Mac and Cheese, of course. Least favourite dish? The steak salad... It is overwhelmingly spicy. Other than that, the food is grade A for bar food, the servers are friendly and the atmosphere is fun!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food that came out fast! Classic pub food. Good service and fun atmosphere. I'd go again if in the area."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for quite a long time, and finally after a hard work out at the nearby Calgary Hot Yoga, I finally did.  It's basically a bar like any other, with the usual sports posters and pictures everywhere, wooden decor and tv screens everywhere with the daily specials and so on.  Service was pretty slow as times in between orders and check ups by the waitress and other staff felt like forever, and that's with me waving my arms at them wildly as if I was in the middle of a taser attack.  Still, it a nice neighbourhood joint, and the nachos looked good.  Beer's cold and with my team members, it's a great place to hang.  Nothing too outstanding, but at the same time, do you really need to be any more?"}
{"text":"Richmond Pub should be the first choice for any sports fan to visit for any reason.  Whether you want to play some pool, the VLT's, or arcade games, or you're just looking to watch the most recent game, Richmond Pub is a great place to go.  Packed with locals and other sports enthusiasts, this place has something to offer everyone.  They've always got wicked deals on food and drinks every night of the week.  Monday nights you can get $6 mini jugs of domestic draft and mini burgers for only $1.  Tuesday offers Calgary's best wing night with over 15 flavours to choose from and $5.50 pints of Keith's - my favourite.  Each Friday is a different beef night, so it varies from week to week.  It just depends on whatever the chef wants to cook... but it's always beefy!  Right now they offer $11.99 jugs of Canadian during all the Stamp's games.  How can you go wrong with that?  I don't really care about watching sports games, since I'm not a huge enthusiast, but I do enjoy watching other people enjoy the game.  This place really comes alive during game nights, whether it's football, hockey, or UFC.  People holler and hoot at the TV's and it's always funny to watch people's reaction to the outcome.    This place is just all around enjoyable.  The staff are great, and so are the customers, and the prices of drinks won't leave you dry.  Get it?  Leave you dry?"}
