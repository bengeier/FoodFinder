{"text":"Torontonians have welcomed Momofuku with open arms and with satisfied stomachs. Last month, David Chang, founder of Momofuku and internationally renowned chef, was in Toronto to play host in an unexpected arena: The TIFF Food on Film series. He joined a sold-out theatre of fellow foodies (including us) to watch his favourite culinary film, Ang Lee's \"Eat Drink Man Woman\", and then engaged the audience in an informal Q&A session that spanned topics ranging from film to the trappings of celebrity chef-hood.

Three hours of salivating over delectable Chinese food on the screen left us craving more than popcorn, so we decided to check out Chang's Momofuku Daisho shortly after...

Momofuku Daisho's ambience is definitely the highlight of the experience. It's open concept and top to bottom glass gives it a simplistic, modern feel. After a successful debut in NYC & Sydney, Chang was lured to Toronto by what he says was a 'perfect and unique' opportunity presented by the Shangrila Hotel: to house three, different takes on his cooking in 1, single building.

With the accessible Noodle Bar already a favourite of ours and a recent lacklustre (and wallet-busting) venture to the top-rated Shoto, we were eager to try our hand at Momofuku Daisho a mid-level offering that centers the menu around pre-ordered, 'family-style' dishes.

As you can probably imagine, it can be challenging enough to pick options in the moment, let alone coordinate an order for our group of 7 a week in advance (of which we were), but eager to get the full experience, we pre-ordered the much hyped about fried chicken and beef short ribs. The waitress kindly cautioned us to tread lightly when considering the rest of our order, on account of the deluge of food on the way. (Warning: Consider your wallet and alternative menu opportunities prior to committing to the pre-order. On a do-over, we would have banked one family style dish and ordered the rest off the menu.

First we enjoyed two dishes of lightly pickled, chilli-infused cucumbers. If these cucumbers are the Asian take on 'bread and butter' the West is in more trouble than economists predict!

Next came the Spicy Sausage and Rice Cake dish, inspired by Chinese Szechuan cuisine: these melt-in-your-mouth rice cakes punctuated by spiced sausage and Asian greens are a quintessential menu creation, packing flavour of Momofukian proportions!

We then indulged in a Momofuku classic: a pork-style bun, this time of the deboned chicken wing variety, coupled with dill, a glazey hot sauce and crudit√©; a real crowd pleaser for our group of 7.

And then, the massive plate of fried chicken arrived in all of its glory. Included with vegetables, scallion pancakes (oily and delicious) and a fancy soya type sauce.

Lastly, we tried the beef ribeye shortribs flanked by white Kimchi, bean sprouts and some sticky white rice. In our not-so-humble opinion, the ribs were a tad on the fatty side,

We decided to end the night right and order the chocolate - five different textures of it. A healthy spectrum of liquid to solidity; an interesting experience, but we'd suggest the more intimate smaller size, even for a larger group like ours.

All in all, we were blissfully overfed at Momofuku Daisho. It was lovely dining with David Chang in town and we luckily caught him at the restaurant to snap a pic. Good friends and good food - what could be better?"}
{"text":"Food was very good.  My friend had the torn pasta and I had the roasted pickerel.  Portion sizes are good and you don't feel stuffed after the meal.  For some reason I didn't think it was fantastic though."}
{"text":"Wow.

What a meal I had last night at Daisho. From the moment I drove up to the building and took in all the people outside (in line for Noodle Bar) and the rooftop party the Shangri La was hosting on the rooftop I felt like it was going to be a sick night. There was so much energy in the building. I felt like I was part of something much bigger than me. I felt like I had \"made it\".

Anyway, I walked up and was promptly seated with my friends. Cocktails are pretty pricey at $16 and they're no different than something you would buy at any other cocktail-focused establishment in the city. Nevertheless I did get a Man About Town and it was stiff and tasty. Here's what food we ordered:

- Pork buns - pretty awesome with peameal and yolk. Breakfast in a bun!
- Rice Cakes - OMG. These were like rice gnocchi in an asian tomato sauce. Incredible texture and flavor on these.
- Wild Rice - least favorite dish. I found it quite salty for my palette.
- Grits - Matt Blondin used to make the best grits at Acadia. These were amazing!
- Apple and Bacon Salad - This dish really worked. Amazing idea, amazing presentation, great flavor profile.
- Cabbage - we got this on a limb and this was actually my favorite dish. They turned one of the most boring vegetables into something truly amazing. The edges of the leaves were slightly charred, that's all I can really tell you--I have no idea what else was in it but everyone at my table couldn't believe they were eating cabbage.
- Hangar Steak - served with bibb lettuce leaves and condiments so you could make your own lettuce wraps. A solid protein plate.
- Chicken - excellent presentation but the flavor left a little to be desired.
- Chocolate - we go the chocolate for dessert. It's like a mousse with some ganache and the chocolate was imported from france. I haven't tasted chocolate like this before.

The final damage was $100pp tip in. A very affordable and truly memorable dining experience. I will be returning to try some of the larger family-style plates."}
{"text":"My experience was heavily relied on my mediocre server. We made reservations and had a patio table at the back by the hotel doors away from the balcony overview. It was getting chilly and I asked if they would turn on the heaters and it was to the managers discretion and not the guest's. You would think for a two person table spending over $200 with a bottle of wine would encourage a more enjoyable experience. For dinner, we had the seaweed salad, secreto ssam, and nugget potatoes - the potatoes was probably the BEST! Then for dessert, I got the sorbet but it was quite dinky and I wouldn't get it again. 

I hope that the hopgood's and monforte collaboration dinner will be better!

Hope this helps!

{"text":"I wanted to love this place but the service is SO bad considering the brand and price I'm baffled!! We made reservations for 2 and got there and we were seated at the bar. The (no personality) bartender was taking our order. I immediately told the hostess we'd like a real table- since we booked a reservation for a table. He said he'll look into it... Didn't come back to me I had to keep checking. We stayed there for 1 hour at least at the bar and many people left and they didn't get us. I saw a table for two leave and they gave it to two people who just walked in. I questioned them about it - and each hostess gave me a different story to excuse it. In the end we left and ate at the Shangri La. They did give us the appetiser on the house when we left - but we wasted our time and stress on this over hyped place. The food we had  was ok."}
{"text":"I would just like to share my expirience with service at Daisho. My girlfriend has serious dietary restrictions due to health problems as well as having food allergies. When we dine out I just know servers loathe us and chalk her up to a fussy eater. Nevertheless they are real and need to be taken seriously. When dining at Daisho, we explained all of her dietary restrictions to our server Matt. You could see him writing her off as a fussy eater \"mhmm-mhmm-mhmm\" he then said that the dishes could be modified and he would inform the kitchen. Low and behold, our food arrives and there is not a single dish my girlfriend can eat. Trust me dude. I know how annoying it is having to modify and change food for one person. I have to do it every single day. But COME ON! Not ONE dish was modified. It was as if he thought she wouldnt notice. So obviously we said something and instead of being apologetic he became defensive. It was clear he was one of those people that never accepted responsibility, even in a life and death situation.
He sent the manager over...Steve? We asked him several questions about the dishes and their ingrediants and he could not answer one single question for us. We were shocked at his lack of knowlege, it was as though he kept looking for a menu, he definately didnt know what dishes were on it. He was not friendly, not apologetic and did not have good people skills.
I would not recommed eating here. A restaurant with such a good reputation and such a high price point should expect more from their staff and especially their managers. I recommend eating at a local restaurant where the service is more personal and the food is less salty and more memorable."}
{"text":"What interested me about Daish? was their \"large formats\" dinners, which include Salt & Pepper Lobster ($250 for 4-6 people), Beef Ribeye ($600 for 6-8 people), and Fried Chicken ($125 for 4-6 people, for some reason, it is no longer on the menu). What got my attention was, of course, their Fried Chicken. Partially due to poor organization, partially due to the fact that not many of my friends actually want to eat expensive fried chicken, the trip to Momofuku Daish? never materialized. When I saw that they were participating in Summerlicious, I just had to go. 

Momofuku Daish?'s interior is modern, sleek and bright. Well, I guess it would have to be, considering it is attached to the swanky Shangri-la Hotel. 

We had the Shrimp Bun and the Falafel Bun as appetizers. The Falafel Bun was... strange. I love falafels, and I love Chinese steamed buns. But they do not belong together. A steamed pillowy soft and slightly sweet bun, meets a deep fried, kind of hard/slightly oily chickpea falafel... Not a harmonious combination. These two things should never meet. On the other hand, their Shrimp Bun was great, possibly the best dish we ate that night.

M had the Trout, which was beautifully presented, served at room temperature. It was very mild in flavour. I had the Pork Chop, also beautifully presented, also served at room temperature. I liked the incorporation of noris, it makes for a very Asian inspired flavour profile. The pork chop was a bit chewy, because it was very lean. 

We had the Cake Truffles and Field Strawberry Pie for dessert. They were not a good way to end a meal. When I asked our server for more details on their Field Strawberry Pie, she said that it was \"just like the strawberry pie from McDonald's\". Her words, not mine. Probably not a good way to describe your dishes, considering the setting. Both desserts were okay... at best.

Please check out my blog for more! :)

{"text":"Too much hype! Came here for dinner with colleagues and us rather unimpressed. Asked the waiter to put together a tasting menu which was rather unsatisfying. A lot of the items from the cucumber salad to rice cake you could have gotten elsewhere for a fraction of the price. Service was also excruciatingly slow... After making were cleared we ordered desert and tea/coffee. Took 15 minutes for the tea to arrive; 30 minutes for the dessert to."}
{"text":"Came out with a friend for a weekend dinner. We were seated at the Nikai Bar. The atmosphere was warm and the service was friendly. Our server offered her in-depth knowledge of items of the menu. We got the shrimp buns, which were freshly steamed and delicious. For mains, the lamb saddle, which came out medium rare, concerned my hungry stomach, but after one bite, I was sold with its smooth texture and fresh taste. The pork tenderloin lettuce wraps were well-cooked. The spicy mayo sauce added a nice kick to the wrap. Similar to a previous post, we did find the mustard green very salty, almost as if too much soya sauce was added. 

After finally having dined at Momofuku, I must admit their dishes are creative with excellent service. A bit overpriced however. I would be keen to return to try out the noodle bar downstairs next time."}
{"text":"We really screwed up here by not ordering the fried chicken or the shared plates.  We ordered other items off the menu and spent a lot of dough, but we were still hungry at the end.  Don't make the same mistake we did, order the shared dishes in advance."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Daish? for their $45 Summerlicious prix fixe menu.  While we were reasonably content with the meal overall, the food did not live up to the reputation or the price point.

Our first point of contact was a good one with our reception.  Our server was friendly, present and approachable.  Some of the service staff milling about our table were dressed in tshirts and jeans I would consider more appropriate for a place in the Annex, but this wasn't a deal breaker for us.  

Our meal started off with an amuse bouche of potato salad with dill and a milk potato foam.  It was tasty, but we were ready for real food.  

For the first real course, I had a Philly Bun (their take on a philly cheese steak) and my wife had a radish salad.  Both were satisfying in their contents, but the bun was tiny.  I was being sort of dainty with it, but I could have easily polished it off in two bites if I was plowing through it.  If I could have, I would have eaten a dozen of those for dinner and been quite happy.  My wife had the radish salad and said it was quite tasty.

My main course was the chicken dish, which consisted of a braised chicken rolled around a sausage with peaches and heirloom tomatoes.  The dish was nice in concept, but it was on the edge of being over salted.   If it were any saltier, I would have likely sent it back.  The portions were not huge, with two pieces of chicken approximately 2 inches across and 1 inch thick.  The flavours worked decently well together, but it was hard to get past the salt.  I couldn't tell if it was from the sausage meat or the braising liquid it was in (which may have over salted as it reduced).  

My wife had the trout, which appeared to be cooked nicely and had a slaw with banana peppers in it with watermelon.  Again, the portion sizes weren't huge, but she seemed to enjoy her entree well enough.

This was followed by a pre-dessert which consisted of a sugar-cube sized block of blueberry jelly with a small dollop of goat yoghurt.  To me, it tasted a lot like one of those fruit-on-the-bottom yoghurt cups.

Our desserts were the cornbread with popcorn and butterscotch panna cotta for me and the ice cream sandwich for my wife.  She found it frozen to the point where it was difficult to cut through.  The cornbread was pretty good, as I tend to like savoury desserts more than sweet ones.  

Our overall impressions were that the meal was a bit pricey for what we had received.  If this meal was at $35 and they had omitted the amuse bouche and the pre-dessert courses, we would have been pretty content with it all.  I gave three stars because of the smaller portion sizes as well as the saltiness of my chicken dish (I couldn't overlook it, unfortunately).  

We'd be willing to give Daisho another shot, but not before we checked out the other Momofuku offerings.  I was very excited to hear that it was in Toronto when it arrived some time ago, but I have to wonder if my excitement was somewhat overblown after my first experience there."}
{"text":"We were 20 minutes late for our reservation at the noodles bar, but amazingly, they held our table. We had the okonomyaki, pork belly buns, fish Sando, chicken meatball bun and ramen. All were absolutely delicious and met my expectations! Food is well seasoned but not too much. The portions are acceptable for the price. For everything we ordered, we spent $55 bucks for 2 people. In addition to being late, I let the hostess know that we'd need to rush out I 45 minutes for an appointment I needed to get to and she said no problem! We were in and out in no time! Great service, great food! Will be back again to try the milk bar ;)"}
{"text":"Again, I wish I could utilize a half star in my rating; a 3.5 would be appropriate.  Artistry comes before the food here, as does pretension before comfort. I am no stranger to fine dining, but the hype far outweighs the reality at this restaurant. I am glad I experienced the prix fixe dinner, but I wouldn't do it again. $500 (approximately, including tip, about 7 courses, bottle service and a couple more drinks) was definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"Ate here last night with my partner.  We had excellent, attentive service which could be attributed to it being Tuesday and while not empty, it wasn't crazy busy.
Cocktails (i met her in mexico and some version of a manhattan which is not listed on their online menus) were really delicious and a great way to start our meal.
The complimentary pickles were really tasty, and was pleasantly surprised to be given a second serving after we inhaled the first.
We started with the steamed buns, one chicken karaage, and one pakora (after our server suggested we not overdo it on two orders, which we greatly appreciated in the end) which were lovely, light fluffy buns, crispy chicken and crunchy pakora.
A jar of kimchi was just lovely to snack on throughout the meal.
The roasted rice cakes with spicy pork sausage was really tasty, loved the crispy bits of the rice cakes.
Our mains were the hangar steak ssam, and the pork shoulder steak.  The steak ssam was our favourite dish of the evening, with incredibly tender beef, sweet caramelized onion and kimchi all piled into lettuce wraps.  The pork shoulder served with  fried rice, was tasty but on the verge of being too salty for my taste.
Sides were nugget potatoes with chunks of fried ham, kewpie mayo were perfectly crisped and sufficiently dressed. Loved them.  And asparagus with snow crab and poached egg - we really loved this, being suckers for perfectly poached eggs, and the crab leant a great salty contrast to the asparagus.
We decided against dessert, being as full as we were. Though, we did stop by Milk and pick up cookies and crack pie for later that night. 
All in all, a great first Momofuku experience for us, and we spent less than expected (around $200 including tip), though if we had gone on a Friday or Saturday, I expect our drink orders would pad the bill quite a bit more.  I look forward to going back in the not too distant future."}
{"text":"I ate here on recommendation from a friend. We accidentally booked into the 3rd floor (after thinking we were going to the Noodle Bar) but I'm glad we did. The food was great (especially the crispy chicken buns and biscuits!)

We ordered a few dishes to share (about 4-5 entrees and 2 appetizers for a group of 6) and all the food came out together. The portions were reasonable and very filling. The cocktails were great, nicely blended and unique. Service was great too - attentive but not overbearing.

It was a little pricey but worth it for the quality of the food, the nice ambiance of the restaurant and the good service. I'll definitely be back and I'm looking forward to trying the noodle bar as well."}
{"text":"Had the squid burger - not bad.  The menu is great and the view is awesome with the floor-to-ceiling windows.  Found the fries a bit too salty but otherwise I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My Supper Club recently had dinner at Momofuku Daisho.  I had pre-ordered us the Bo Ssam large format meal, which serves 8-10 and costs $240.  That's the base price and then any additional drinks, food, tax, and tip are added on top of that.    There was a group of 10 of us.

I was served an unimaginative non-alcoholic cocktail, but my dining companions liked the growler of Bellwoods and the beer selection.

In addition to the Bo Ssam, I shared an extra dish of the halibut cheek crudo, because I love crudo.  The crudo was sliced a little thick for me, for a fish like halibut cheeks.  It would have been better if things had been sliced thinner.  It wasn't as nice as the crudo at Porzia.  The toppings for this crudo were kind of unimaginative (caper berries, fried wonton crisps, some thinly sliced white radish) and there wasn't any lubricating element like oil, or acid to bring all the elements of the plate together.

Overall, I wasn't overly impressed with Daisho.  I thought the service, for a \"fine-dining\" establishment was really poor.  When the Dotytron and I walked in, we were told there was a 2 hour seating limit, which hadn't been made clear to me when I made the reservation or at any of the multiple points of contact the restaurant made to confirm the reservation.  Then, even though we were clearly waiting for the rest of our party to arrive, the server was like, \"Well, your bo ssam is ready, and it's at its peak of perfection now,\" and I'm like, well what the heck am I supposed to do about that?  That's not MY FAULT.  What kind of restaurant expects to throw out a giant hunk of meat as soon as you sit down?  It's just poor and it set a bad tone.  

Then, when the rest of my dining companions had arrived, and I indicated to the server that they could send out the bo ssam, she was like, \"well, it will be ready in 15 minutes or so.\"  WELL WHICH IS IT?  IS IT AT THE \"PEAK OF PERFECTION\" (your words, lady, NOT mine!) OR NOT?!?!?  

The Bo Ssam was delicious, I have to admit.  The fat was nicely caramelized and the meat tore off in fat-soaked chunks.  It's not something a semi-competent home cook couldn't replicate at home, though.  It's just a 6lb pork shoulder, slow roasted.  It's served with white rice, oysters (a measly dozen), kimchi, a ginger-scallion sauce, and pickled cucumbers.  The menu at Daisho was uninspiring, overall.  If the crudo and the service was any indication, I wasn't impressed and I had a hard time, looking at the menu, thinking of other dishes I would have ordered, had the Bo Ssam left us with any room.  The room is beautiful, but I'm in no hurry to go back."}
{"text":"This review is for the newly added brunch. I would give it 6 stars if I could. Absolutely amazing experience. Service was very attentive and friendly. Food was INCREDIBLE. Best brunch my fianc√© and I have ever had. We ordered the blueberry pancakes with cultured butter and the breakfast sandwich.  The pancakes had the perfect texture and balance of flavors - you could taste it all, the rich buttermilk, the tart blueberries, the savory butter, and the sweet maple syrup!  Best pancakes of our lives. The breakfast sandwich was equally as mind-blowing. The English muffin was on point in texture and flavor. We never knew an English muffin could taste that good. The combination of ingredients inside the sandwich was phenomenal with the egg perfectly cooked so the yolk could be sopped up. It came served with tasty sides of potatoes and hot sauce. I should mention the space itself is pretty beautiful, full of natural light and city views! All I have left to say is, \"Thank you, Daisho.\""}
{"text":"Great food ! I had my b-day here not long ago and was very impressed with the food selection and quality of the food . Not the cheapest place in the world but worth it! Ill be back soon, Cheers"}
{"text":"This restaurant got this 1 star because I love Momofuku cook book, I have always wanted to try David Chang restaurant and I finally did, and it was a gigantic disappointment. 

We went for Summerlicous and we had a group of 11 people, we came here for our friends' b-day. 

Food: nice presentation, smaller size portion but I dont complain about that, you have 2 predetermined courses and 3 other courses of your choice so you still have variety of food which I like. Other than that nothing really wow me about the food. My fav dish was homemade jelly candy with cream cheese which is 1 of the predetermined dishes. 

Service: There have been lots of review about bad service at this place so I am going to make this short. Nothing but a big disappointment. Our server was Brian, Brian with an attitude. Our server refused to take order of the last 2 friends coming to the dinner, and they came 5' after all of us. We asked him if we can order he said he can't take order and walked away. The other 2 girls at the bar saw it and came over to take the order. From that point on, Brian was no where to find. He showed up when we get the bill, we asked for the separate bills and he gave us a disgusting face, is separate bill something very new here in restaurant industry, i dont think so because I have been to numerous restaurants and they ask if I want separate bill when they take order.

I need to get back to work but my conclusion of this review is David Chang should be ashamed for having his name on this restaurant."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO THERE, my french grandma would have died just by tasting this over cooked and grilled frozen small trout at 45$. And I am not talking about the rest, it is just full of no taste.

This is the worse place ever, they are clearly over over over priced and the quality is under under under everything I could imagine. I do not remember having a such bad food in years. For the price, you get 1 star Michelin in France, how come this restaurant is still open? How come they are still allowed to sell food at a such price? 

One star but it sincerely deserves -12. 

Seriously, is David Hasselof the cooker?"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic upscale Asian fusion restaurant with quite memorable and unique dishes.

I have tried many of their dishes: nugget potatoes, scallops, duck breast, mussels. I cannot remember them all. You cannot really go wrong with any of their menu items.

Their service is also outstanding, I don't think I've had better service at another restaurant."}
{"text":"Had the 2nd most amazing lunch ever in Toronto!  Fabulous food, only to be topped by the exceptional service. Staff were extremely professional, laid back, interested and interesting.  Not sure that Toronto appreciates the excellence this restaurant represents. PS - so happy brussels sprouts made it to the menu!! Heaven."}
{"text":"This is NOT a Japanese restaurant, please don't be fooled by its name. It's typical westernized Asian food. Quality of the food is alright, but I highly recommend the chicken wings. Service is great and I like the interior design of the restaurant. However, I feel like this is just a simplified and expensive version of Springroll. If you're looking for something authentic, go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Shockingly bad experience after all I have heard about the place.
The space as you come in is impressive, large windows everywhere. The seats have no backs, you are sitting on benches so a long dinner becomes quite uncomfortable. 
The noise level is high, so conversations are not easy. 
The wait staff is completely unorganized. We had three waiters asking us what we wanted to order for cocktails. Then three of  us got the drinks and the forth was left at the counter for so long that we ended up getting it ourselves.
The food was good, not exceptional for a foodie. 
The worst part of the evening was when we were given one drink we had not ordered.  We didn't know if that was part of  an order they got wrong. Couldn't get the attention of the waiter to ask about it so we each had a sip because the colour of the drink was so extraordinary. Nobody liked it so it just stayed on the table. About ten minutes later a waiter came and said \" oh I made a mistake, you didn't order that!\" whisked the glass ( which four people had tried!) off the table and then disappeared very quickly before we could say anything. He then took it to another table and served that drink!!!!!! 
I will never go to a restaurant again where I know my drink could have been tasted by strangers. No basic waiting etiquette, too loud, uncomfortable and food not outstanding enough for all of that. There are such great places in Toronto which deserve much more attention."}
{"text":"I took friends from out of town for dinner b/c of the hype of this restaurant. I was embarrassed at how poor the food was and the service. A seafood appetizer came and it had the worst looking seafood with a couple of what looked like small cocktail shrimp and a few other assorted pieces of seafood. For the price the entire table was shocked at the quality let alone the quantity. The food when downhill from there. The only item enjoyed was the chicken roll. Our friends own a restaurant and they were so looking fwd to this dinner but left dismayed as we were with the food."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences in a restaurant.  Service = horrible!!!!!  Or server Rob, miserable!   Forgot our order , not once twice, and when we asked about he was rude.  Paid with my credit card, issues with machine, and instead of owning it asked me to pay twice even after I called visa and confirmed payment.  Will never go back again ."}
{"text":"Food just wasn't very well executed. Was expecting more after visiting the nyc location."}
{"text":"We went to Daisho on Wednesday for our anniversary and it was nothing short of fantastic. We chose to do the summerlicious menu. We both chose the buns to start, I had the trout and my boyfriend had the spareribs. Both were beautifully prepared and garnished, the desserts were lovely as well. It was apparent that the staff did everything they could to make it a special night for us,  especially the hostess. The hostess made sure we had a seat near the window and even gave us complimentary sparkling wine to celebrate.  We will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Incredible! We were on the 3rd floor - by the windows overlooking the city. Just that ... makes the experience start off with a wow

The buttermilk biscuits , the agnolotti , the everything buns .... AMAZING !!! We had a bonus round of the agnolotti  !
Oh! Try the surprise me drink - yummy!!!

Service is friendly and impeccable - 5 stars !!!"}
{"text":"A bit overpriced for what you get. The seats were not very comfortable but I think that's the style they were going for. I got the pork noodle and pork buns, it was just ok. Also the spoons are not good ramen spoons. They are small and fall into your bowl easily when set to the side. These spoons are commonly used when I have Chinese food, not ramen."}
{"text":"Our waiter was wearing Under Armour. Seriously? A table of 6 paid $700 for a guy to wear a black under armour shirt? He was nice, but u guys ran out of the wine we wanted, and gave us attitude. Never again."}
{"text":"Awesome ambience. Great food! A little pricey, but a great experience! I will go back!"}
{"text":"made reservations for Winterlicious before our unfortunate incident at Noodle Bar so we went ahead with dinner here.  had the sweet and sour squash, grilled fish and requeson while husband had duck buns, beef shoulder, beets (from regular menu) and chocolate dessert.  everything was well executed.  the flavors and textures were playfully mixed together and worked.  the squash had the sourness from the sour cream and sweetness and crunch from these small candy pieces.  the fish and beef were just the right flakiness or tenderness.  the chocolate dessert i grew tired of quickly after a few bites so fortunately My dessert was really the requeson which is not even sweet and had some coffee bean pieces that provided a favorite dessert flavor."}
{"text":"A friend of mine heard about Momofuku in New York and since it recently opened in Toronto we all wanted to it out.

Made reservations on the web.  We were expecting noodles and their special fried chicken but when we got to our table on the third floor, we didn't see any of these on the menu.  Turns out that each Momofuku floor is a different restaurant.  This wasn't clear on the web when I reserved and we were extremely confused for the first part of experience.

Momofuku Daisho is very open concept and you're immersed in the city by the wall to wall window view.  The food is excellent but overpriced.  The wine is also overpriced with the low end average around $80.  We started with the burger bun and had 6 little burger buns (1each) for $36.  On the menu it said $12 but we didn't know if it was for 1 or for all 6.  We also had the chicken tights, sorento, and rice cakes.  All very good.  The corn side was excellent as we're the mushrooms.


The experience was good but they really need to clarify that each Momofuku is different.  Again we were expecting a $20 - $30 noodle meal and instead had one for over $50 each.  Had we known about the different prices in each restaurant it wouldn't had been so bad.  However, we left hungry and confused.  That being said, it's still pricy for the portion size.

My advice, make sure you know what you are going to get.  It is very confusing."}
{"text":"Wow...

Went here with 5 friends and ended up having the BEST brisket I've ever tasted (as a Jew that's saying a lot).

The 6 of us ended up with the large format brisket which is next level. They roast this bitch up for 20 hours and you get amazing candy crusted, super juicy melt in your mouth slab of cow. The meat itself is extremely next level, but they also decided to destroy your idea of good brisket by providing pillowy soft baos, creamy home made crab mayo, an intensely crisp papaya slaw and something that reminded me of chimichuri but koreanized. Grab all this stuff throw a slab of meat on the bao and BOOM! DavidChangFlavorCountry. 

I totally forgot about the two dozen oysters we destroyed prior to the 'God Brisket'. They come garnished with this amazing pickled rye grain thing that tastes like bacon... Ok ok! 

Dessert was frozen chocolate mousse cake with milk gelatin and puffed rice. D.E.A.D.L.Y. 

Add to that an amazing bourbon Manhattan, and champagne and I live a pretty good life

Service is fun, and on point. Ambiance is a giant futuristic glass cube. What a time to live in!

If my spelling and grammar suck, awesome!

The end."}
{"text":"Was there with a group of 10 eating family style. Overall, not satisfied. Overpriced, not equivalent to quality and detail...if you want decent Asian fare, definitely look else where. Most average food. The space's acoustic are horrible, uncomfortable seats, poor lighting. More a place to be seen but not enjoyed!!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced. My server looked like she was in last nights pajamas. The \"sharing dishes\" came all at once so it all got cold and we were finished a $300 meal in 45 minutes.  Not worth the money. Pretty much a rip off and aside from the view, just like any other overpriced restaurant that gets away with charging too much for small \"sharing\" dishes."}
{"text":"Great food, best service I've experienced in Toronto. I'm surprised the service was still so efficient even though we were ordering the cheaper \"summerlicious\" menu. Efficient but not overbearing service and delicious food."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times with pleasant experiences. The room is really cool, high ceilings looking onto University Avenue. Service has been good and the food is very creative. I've been a couple times and always like the food. Top quality, but there is always a little something missing which is why the 4 stars."}
{"text":"Rice cakes.  Fried chicken.  Growler of beer.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"Daisho was disappointing to say the least. Had a reso for three, but one was stuck at work, so the two of us took our seats and told the waitress we'd wait for the third. 

Got some drinks while we waited and that might have been the best part of the experience. Tried Fresh Ginger Ginger Ale by Bruce Cost ($4). A really refreshing flavor from pop ginger ale. 

Despite knowing we were waiting for the third to arrive, the waitress was quite pushy on having us order something. So we got the shrimp bun ($12), which sounded good when described, but was underwhelming when it arrived. Ingredients were very minimalist, and the flavors were very basic; nothing impressive.

Anyway, once it was clear the third wouldn't be able to make it in time, we ordered the hanger steak and chicken thigh ($50 in sum). Again, disappointing. Mediocre protein, no wow factor with the flavors (kimchi and sriracha), and the portions were very limited. 

Really nothing to rave about here. I think the only reason I'm giving two stars instead of one is that the experience does seem more enjoyable in a larger-sized party with whom you'd have access to the \"large\" format items. That said, the hypothesis here is that beyond the novelty factor, the food probably wouldn't taste any better."}
{"text":"Just want to leave a 5 star review for Bianca, the hostess at Daisho last night. My party size changed during the week and I was unable to change it online and the regular \"reservationist\" was not helpful. Bianca went out of her way to accommodate us - emailing and calling during the evening with updates before she was able to accomodate us and ensure that we could be seated - even slightly earlier than our late reservation time. Her attention to ensuring we had a great experience was hugely appreciated. The Summerlicious menu was also good and our server was excellent but really it was her service that made the difference to our evening. She is the Dining Diva of Daisho! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Hosted a Sunday brunch party for a group of VIPs visited oversea.

The big format beef rib and pork butt were good as usual, also requested a seafood tower, I did not set a budget just requested it has to be enough to feed 13 people. The tower was a big disappointment, things don't seem to be that fresh, portions were very small, kind of awkward to share in such big group, the tower was more for 6 people party at the most. 

when I made the reservation, I've also mentioned the guests are extremely particular with wine, we really need someone good on site for recommendation. The wine was a big disappointment as well, they only had our server to introduce who was not very experienced with wine. 

Our guests were not impressed with the meal at all.

Will not host another important party here again"}
{"text":"I should probably give 3 stars because it wasn't that bad, but....

We went for a birthday dinner and were a large group of 16.  Food was hit and miss:  the fried chicken was very nice, the pork was very nice (both pre-ordered).  But, the various salads and side dishes were greasy and oily.  There was a brussel sprouts dish that was just a soup of oil with some sprouts and a couple of other veggies drowning in that oil.  When the meat dishes are on the oilier/fattier side like fried chicken and pork, then one would hope for something a little fresher tasting to accompany it.

The service was mediocre.  The Maitre d' was intrusive and annoying, while the servers were trying hard, even if not always on the ball.

On the positive side, it definitely has a Manhattan feel to it, which is probably the reason most people go.  It definitely has that glitzy, Vegas-feeling that not a lot of places in Toronto have.  The absence of those kinds of places is something I'd always liked about the Toronto dining scene.  Oh well, the pretentious crowd needs a place to congregate too I suppose.

For my tastes, at that price ($350 for dinner and drinks for two of us) you could have a much better meal and a much better experience at Pangaea, or Canoe, or any number of other establshments."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times- most recently for their Easter Brunch. I have always had nothing but fantastic experiences with regards to food & customer service. 

Today I had the Everything bun which had smoked whitefish, cr√®me fraiche, horseradish, red onion, and capers. It was amazing, and reminded me of the classic bagel with cream cheese, smoked salmon, and capers. 

I also had the eggs Benedict. UNREAL. Eggs were cooked to perfection and the hollandaise had a wonderful, slightly spiced flavour. Came with a generous potion too for what I thought was a fair price- $18 with back bacon. Too bad they don't do brunch every weekend. 

My waitress was attentive, funny, and made the meal experience more enjoyable. This isn't the first time I've had a great wait staff here, which makes me wonder why so many negative comments are service oriented. Thought I'd throw in my two cents for those considering Daisho."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time during Winterlicious at lunch and I will probably go back again before it's over this year. The staff was delightful, very nice and personable. 

Every table gets a little bowl of cucumbers with some chilli flakes and I believe some sort of vinegar to start.

As an appetizer I ordered the potato soup with smoked white fish and the way they presented it was super cool. Now, I know soup and fish seems odd, I too was skeptical at first but the waiter convinced me it was delicious. They plated the fish with some fried and fresh capers, and creme fresh then they come over and pour the soup on top. The smoked fish tasted more like bacon than anything. It was definitely one of the best soups I have ever eaten.

Next I had the roasted Szechuan rice cakes which were so damn delicious. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with a bit of a kick. Out of all three of the main dishes I would say this is the most filling one. 

For dessert I had what looked like a deconstructed chocolate brownie with ice cream, fried banana chips and whipped cream. It was excellent, I mean you can't go wrong with a brownie!

Highly recommend this place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Too casual and too much attitude.   The FOH manager didn't even smile  as he walked around more like a security.   Treat summerlicious menu like cheap eats.   We purposely ordered additional things to try.   The food is not good enough for the attitude or the under dress style of supposedly 5 star hotel.   Didn't feel like it's a good representation of what Toronto has to offer."}
{"text":"recently went to Daisho for the christmas eve prix fix ($65 per person) and had an wonderful experience. The quality and amount of food was well worth the money. The starting apps (salad, squash, smoked sturgeon) were delicious and were a great lead to the main dish, the whole speckled trout - which I believe is on the usual menu.

This was definitely the highlight of the meal. the fish was lightly battered and served with a veggies and an amazing sauce. It was slightly creamy but not overpowering. Would definitely order this again.

the 2 veggie sides were charred cabbage (seasoned slightly with cheese) and basically a potato pancake, but instead of potato they used rutabaga which I am a huge fan of. The pancake also had chunks of brussels sprouts, so the slight bitterness went really well with the rest of the dish. This was probably my 2nd favourite dish of the night.

The dessert was a dry fruit pudding which taste a bit like fruit cake - wasn't a big fan of this but that's just personal preference. Honestly one of my favourite meals in recent memory, especially at this price point."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for a 3 course lunch meal. The dishes were definitely interesting and fushion.  Overall the experience was okay; nothing very special considering its price."}
{"text":"So first time to Momofuku Daisho in Toronto on a Wed night in January, given I was staying at the Shangri-la it seemed like an easy option for a meal. It was reasonably busy and a number of staff running around. Took the elevator up to level 3 came out and stood around for 5+ minutes waiting to get seated. Off to a bad start, and I was already feeling like if they don't want to seat me then I'll happily walk away. Barked at the bartender who then promptly sat me down (two tables free and bar area too). 

On to the food ordered the hanger steak ssam and the broccoli with Chinese sausage. Steak accompanied by wrapping leaves with optional scallion/garlic sauce and/or fresh chilli sauce - by no means bad but by no means spectacular. Broccoli on the other hand burnt and generally unremarkable.

On balance I don't believe I'll be back again given the extended wait time to be seated, at minimum I'd expect other staff to notice there is someone waiting and then suggest the person responsible for seating will be with me soon but instead I was left standing there. If I was in Chinatown at a cheap and cheerful place I would probably be less concerned, and I appreciate this isn't the pinnacle of fine dining but there are minimum levels of service I'd expect for a restaurant that's going to charge 50 CAD pp for a meal."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try Daisho with my husband in mid December 2013 as we'd heard such great things about it both review-wise and via some of our best foodie friends. 
Being the season of office parties and holiday reveries and catch-ups, we had to accept the last seating of the evening at 11pm. Both the hostess and our waiter were a little smug, which may be excusable given the time of year and time of night, but it was disappointing nonetheless. We also felt rushed into ordering and finishing our meal, which I believe is never acceptable given the relatively high price of the menu items. 
The food was good, but I felt it a little over-rated and quite pricey--there are so many other Toronto restaurants that are, in my opinion, a better value and better example of Fusion Asian Cuisine. The menu appears to have changed from when we visited, so it wouldn't be fair to mention what we had--it was all very rich and frankly, a bit bland in flavour and texture. 

Despite this, I'd go again with someone a little more versed in their menu! I'd love to give Daisho a 5 star rating and be proven wrong!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for Daisho given the hype about the large format dinner. Our party of 6 ordered the beef short ribs and were advised to order 3 additional sides, which we did. 

The beef short ribs arrived and were impressive. The accompaniments, not so much. 1 small bowl of white rice, 1 small bowl of white kimchi and 1 small bowl of bean sprouts for 6 people was underwhelming. When we asked for an extra bowl of kimchi and bean sprouts, we were told there was none available. This I find unacceptable for a meal that is $220 right off the bat. Luckily we had ordered the sides of cauliflower (deliciously sweet), mushrooms (nice), and ramps (small and ok). The ribs, though delicious to start, went cold quickly which made them tough to eat. I had a hard time sawing the meat off the bones after this point. The sauce that accompanied was very salty and thick, almost gelatinous, and at times unappetizing.

The crack pie and rhubarb desserts were decadent and fulfilling. The crack pie was a sugar bomb as expected, and the rhubarb tender and perfect. This was, unfortunately, the best part of the meal.

The service was intrusive at times and slow at others; hardly had our party sat down before we were asked what we wanted to drink. When our beef short ribs came with none of our additional sides, I asked the waiter if they were coming and he said \"Yes. Would I answer otherwise?\". It was well into our meal before these did arrive, with no apologies for the delay.

The atmosphere is nice, particularly if you are lucky enough to catch a beautiful sunset from the glass-enclosed dining room. I would go back to Daisho for their impressive cocktail and wine list and lovely space, but nothing else."}
{"text":"My friend and I heard about this place from the Munchies documentary. We planned and saved up for eight weeks to super splurge on a huge meal with cocktails and everything. We made a reservation more than a week in advance just in case. (We heard that sometimes you cannot get a reservation for days on a row.)

Anyway, we arrived outside and already we were impressed the beautiful sculpture outside it was a pleasure to look at. The front walkway had glass covered pond with fish in it.

We entered the noodle bar and headed upstairs. We were a bit too early and the staff were doing their powwow before service. 

So we headed to the mid lounge area and the bartender was amazingly friendly. The place was not busy at all and we had a wonderful conversation on a Netflix documentary about the history of wine tasters and sake. The bartender suggested we head to BarChef tomorrow. 

We both had a few cocktails and were the first to sit down. The place is just lovely with the glass and the veiw over the cultural monuments. 

We ordered the Korean rice cakes, the big fish dinner, soy tea eggs for the appetisers. (They were doing a special steamed bun event, so we also got those.) Two desserts and a few more cocktails between the two of us. We ordered a few other items, some kind of deconstruction of an Asian soup. (Name alludes me.)

Anyway, to put this lightly. It was the best meal of my entire life. Hands down. I was actually emotional at the end of the meal and it wasn't just the alcohol. I wanted to hug the staff or maybe leave a really nice note.

I wish I could afford to go to Momofuku more and yes it is expensive but it is 100% worth every hard earned dollar. Don't think about it, just do it because you will not regret it. 

Also, the server was very nice and informed us on all the food. We never felt rushed and she was always attending to our drinks, offering cocktail suggestions (The good ol' surprise me.) removing plates without interrupting our conversations. 

I think I've said everything that needs to be said. Thanks Momofuku 11/10."}
{"text":"The food (fried chicken, lots of sides and the chocolate dessert) was ok, but there was no WOW moment. For this price, this needed to be an out of the world fried chicken. It wasn't. It was a good fried chicken. But good does not justify the hype. None of the sides was that great either. Not even the one with the foie gras. Even the dessert, which tried hard to be overly sophisticated, was nothing to write home about. It was ok but just ok (and this comes from a committed chocoloholic). In short, I felt like a participant in a production of the Emperor's New Clothes. Given all the over the top reviews here, I do feel the need to suggest that this emperor may be wearing very little indeed."}
{"text":"Another disappointed diner. So excited to try Daisho and came craving flavor. What we got was confusing with no point of view and no flavor. Our starters were average, not memorable. We just picked at our mains, they were not edible- soggy, flavorless, gloopy rice cakes and bland short rib. Atmosphere was depressing, felt like a restaurant on the out. Overpriced is an understatement."}
{"text":"Visited Daisho on a Monday night to celebrate my partner's birthday. As there were only two of us we weren't able to indulge in the any of the large format dishes that Daisho is truly known for, but we happily forged on with ordering off of the a la carte menu instead of Winterlicious (which is a steal at $45 / person BTW). 

We started off with cocktails - three wise men and kaleidoscope - flavourful and boozy - in a good way.

The hits: chicken and tongue buns, buckwheat noodles, brussel sprouts, rice cakes, scallops, hanger steak ssam.

The misses: apple kimchi salad - server said it was one of their most popular items: it was not enjoyed; carrot cheesecake - texturally this was great, but was a weird marriage of rustic and sweet, creamy flavours.

Service was thoughtful, conversational and informative. Though, when our dessert arrived, it was served and introduced as being paired with a dessert wine on the house - but I was charged for one glass on my bill. Did not appreciate the hidden up sell.

I might come back to Daisho but only with a group of 4 or more to pre-order one of the large dishes."}
{"text":"Interesting, sometimes delicious food.  I would have been fine with the exorbitant ~ $600 bill (really), but the service was unacceptably bush league.  Aloof, generally absent and ultimately tardy.  We ended up walking away from the remainder of a perfectly good bottle of champagne after our glasses stood empty through the tail end of our meal, opting for espresso down the street rather than sitting there any longer.  I hate to be negative, but I would not be inclined to go back.  Meanwhile, Momofuko proper rocks."}
{"text":"Good, solid food. Cute dessert fridge too with a variety of cookies and cakes. They're yummy! Our service was good."}
{"text":"At Momofuku Daisho I had a big group dinner with friends.  We had the Bo Sam, and a few sides (potatoes, con, and mushrooms).  It was large format food, perfect for sharing with 10 of your friends.

The pork was super tender and juicy, and it came with a big bowl of lettuce leafs, and a few helpful additions to make the wraps perfect: rice, Kim chi, hot sauce made in house, and a diced scallion sauce that is just lovely.  It also came with a dozen oysters - which strangely enough went perfectly with the pork wrap.  A wonderful meal experience.  The view was also terrific.

Go with friends."}
{"text":"I'd have to say this is my favourite of the three floors. The food here is really well done, flavours are bold and ingredients used are fresh. 

Definitely come with friends as the sharing plates are amazing. What sets this place apart from the other two floors is that you get a good value for what you pay. While the top floor does have better food, you are also paying a lot more. 

They also have some interesting beer selections!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars: went for brunch, really great view, slow service, good but unimpressive food...really good buttermilk biscuit though"}
{"text":"Delicious. Not overrated at all. Get the hanger steak and Brussels sprouts. And the crispy chicken buns."}
{"text":"Revised to be more positive :)
Space is soaring upwards, love this airy setting = 2 stars. BLT should stay as a frat house menu , I could've made this at home with random leftovers. Clams were good . Dessert : a peach coconut cobbler could've have been a wow, 
 yet was served as an egg roll with a bit of peach jam.  My hub ordered huge cut prime rib, which takes about an hour, they produced a chewy Flintstone slab that remained mostly untouched by a table of four. They brought out freshly grated horseradish when asked, which was lovely.  Service was fine."}
{"text":"This is for the a la carte menu.  We reserved for 6 last minute and couldn't get in on a large format meal, they were sold out.  Overall I'd say this menu is good - yummy and creative - for up to 4 people but with 5 or more more hungry patrons the pacing of dishes and uncertainty on portion sizes led to an uneven experience, even though we walked away satisfied.

 Get the rice cakes, duck sausage, hanger steak, halibut cheeks, bread and drippings, eggplant, Brussels sprouts, and dumplings.  beware the dumplings are gnocchi style and small, the price is due to copious shaved truffle on it - very tasty but $30

Drink wise (we sent some time at the 2nd floor bar Nikai) we liked the Penicillin, and Fresh Powder.  Wine selection is fine but not extensive.  Good Ontario craft beer picks.


three issues with service
- your table might get delayed.    our table was delayed 25 minutes while a 4-top couldn't stop yapping while staring into their water glasses and signed check from 40 minutes prior.   The host stated he would take care of us with some drinks or appies but I never saw the comp on the final bill.  I place this on teething problems but really... Don't make the offer if you don't see it through

- servers still unfamiliar with ingredients.  Food allergies etc, you need to do your own guessing as the servers seemed to not really know

- dish pacing  and portions- some appies like the duck sausage took a long time whereas others didn't - some dishes low on the menu and priced as mains are quite small - this needs to be clarified better 

Overall the price for 6 with drinks was $300 across 12-13 dishes plus a few drinks, so surprisingly reasonable.  Will be back ESPECIALLY for the large format meals - the fried chicken at other tables looked and smelled amazing, and I've made the Bo ssam at home which is a porkopalypse of love"}
{"text":"Great service, great atmosphere, delicious food but double the price for half the portion. Worth trying (as a foodie) but would not return until it becomes affordable to do so."}
{"text":"We tried to eat here tonight. We found it to be a very difficult task. Every dish we tried to order was unavailable that evening. Perhaps there was a food shortage in Toronto this weekend, or at least it felt that way to us since we are starving now.
Not the best but I honestly can't complain about the food. The air was delicious, though slightly lacking in oxygen, due to its location on the this floor. I'm giving one star because the staff was friendly!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss when it comes to its food menu. Small portions and very pricey. For food, you're better off sticking to the noodle bar on the first floor. However, exceptional service...way better than the noodle bar. Very bright and pleasing decor as well."}
{"text":"We had their brunch.  The hanger steak was delicious so I really wanted to give them more stars but the whitefish buns tasted overwhelmingly like salt.  The ambience is great.  The restaurant is on the second floor with windows looking over the street.  Our waiter was average at best."}
{"text":"If you want to spend a lot of money on tiny portion of mediocre food and getting the service like those in China town in a well-decorated restaurant, this is the place. 

1 star for the decor."}
{"text":"Tried it for Summerlicous. And based on reviews went in expecting it to be just OK. Came out feeling as such. Service was slow. Food was OK. But do try the Crack Cake - There's a reason it's called that."}
{"text":"Massively disappointing. We tried the Summerlicious menu: yes, I understand that I'm not going to get the best of the best when selecting the Summerlicious menu, but I thought the idea was to use the menu to give customers a reason to come back to the restaurant- which I will not be doing. First, the goodish: the restaurant is well-placed and beautiful- it is acoustically a bit weird, but not to the point where it's completely distracting. We had the chicken buns and radish salad to start, the somen noodles and trout as mains, and finished with all 3 desserts offered. The food was tasteless (except for the radish salad, which was almost overwhelming) and I had the distinct feeling that the mains had been pre-made and heated up like leftovers in a microwave. The desserts were OK, but nothing to write home about. Overall, the food was wickedly terribly awful. The portions were tiny and though the manager did offer us another dish, there was nothing that could convince us to accept another tasteless dish. I don't mind paying for good food and you'd think $200 could buy a little more flavour. Shameful. I will not be going back again. Ever."}
{"text":"In short: party of 6, reserved short ribs dinner on a Friday night. Mediocre food. Good service. Nice ambiance. 

My foodie friend made the reservation with a credit card and told us we had to arrive within 15 minutes of the booking time, or she'd be charged $100. Miraculously everyone showed up 5-10 minutes early, and our table was already ready! 

The main course came after more than half an hour - here's why I don't get why you have to reserve this dish in advance... because it still took forever to get it and we were looking longingly at other tables that ordered the much cheaper Fried Chicken dish (and damn it looked good).  

The meat on the short ribs is super fat - the kind of \"marble\" fat you can cut off easily... but wow. The meat itself literally melts in your mouth. The sauce reminded me of the sauce you get on short ribs in a Chinese restaurant though, nothing special. There's white rice on the side. Overall though, it was completely unmemorable and the side of rice just...really reminded me of a Chinese restaurant, except the dish is $220.  What's different I guess, is that this is marketed not really as a Chinese restaurant, but you're sharing a plate of food and eating it with rice.  I guess my disappointment stems at the fact that I expected something far more amazing for that price but in the end I got either an upscale Chinese food failure or some boring attempt at \"fusion\". 

The ribs were enough to satisfy six hungry diners, but we did order Rice Cakes (for $15) afterwards.  It was covered in a spicy, meaty sauce... almost like a pasta sauce. Gotta say it seemed weird at first and the rice cake texture is crunchy, kind of like hot pot rice where you want to eat the rice that has crusted to the bottom. I did like this dish though. 

I also had a beer which ended up to be 10x more bitter than I had liked. I actually like trying new beers and have been relatively successful with server recommendations (like at the Bier Market, etc) but this was a bust. Our server took the beer back and gave me another one that was more enjoyable...but then charged me for both. Well I guess if you were going to charge me for both, you could've left both on the table so I could give it to my other friends instead of taking back the first one without even asking.... (The beers ranged from $7 - $9.) 

Overall, this is a fancy place if you want to \"impress\"; there is something nice about being up high although it's just the third floor. It's loud and a good atmosphere.  I do want to try their pork buns downstairs (which you can't order from the 3rd floor - they had some peameal bun instead) at another time. 

The location is also great -- there is $5 parking place at 55 University for after 6pm (covered), with the entrance being on Wellington."}
{"text":"Went to Daisho to celebrate a birthday. Exceptional service, whenever we had a menu in front of us someone was willing to offer help and if they didn't know the answer they were eager to find someone who did. The food was amazing to say the least. We had the raw scallops, duck burgers, and trout. All were amazing. Everyone must try these scallops. The environment and atmosphere was very inviting and enjoyable. Overall a great night."}
{"text":"Looking for a dinner option in the college and university area....it was down to Dai Lo, Daisho or Bar Raval. My experience with bar Isabel wasn't great, and the Star ripped apart Dai Lo. However our experience  with the Momofuku empire through the Ssam bar was awesome, so decided to try the Daisho bar.  

Food & value: 3.5/5 Nothing bad, but not wowed by anything either unlike our experience at the Ssam Bar in NY. 

Dishes tried:We were also able to select dishes from the Nikai (bar) menu.

Buns: BBQ pork, Crispy chicken 
Ramen (pork belly)
Rice cakes with pork
Hanger Steak 
Ice cream: Cereal milk and Butter scotch 

Service: 4/5 Friendly & helpful. 
Ambience: 4/5

Repeat: Perhaps not. Based on the reviews here and in the media, I think the daisho bar has fallen victim to Chang's aggressive expansion."}
{"text":"AMAZING. This place is one of the best places to eat Japanese and fusion food made with such a craftiness that you will be amazed. A bit expensive but it is worth every penny. Do dress up a bit to go here (not much, you are not going to a wedding). And enjoy!"}
{"text":"So disappointing, staff dresses like they where going to paint theirs homes or garden. fine dining prices with snack bar service. 
The food was nothing special for those prices there are much better places to dine in Toronto. The while the food looks good it lacks flavour and excitement, all but two dishes  we ordered where bland and tasteless. 
The $37 pork shop was served with a chickpea curry I still cannot figure out where the flavor went?? It was supposed to taste like something for 37$ but it did notoriety than it tasted like a grilled piece of meat and something that resembled chickpeas with a minimal about of brown gravy that had no substance. 
The food is all served for sharing but when the second wave of dishes where being served the staff could not  figure out how to put the dishes on the table! They struggled moving empty dirty dishes around while trying to place the next course on the table. 
Our server watched the others struggling to serve our second course staring like a dear in the headlights not even considering to remove the dirty dishes. It's simple solution, remove the dirty dishes before bringing the next course. 
This hipster place with untrained servers and food that in most cases is very bland is a miss. Spend your money somewhere else if you do not you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Reservations highly recommended as it is popular. Very hipster and a nice lively ie. Loud atmosphere. Food is creative but not for everyone. I enjoyed the variety but some in my party hardly ate. We ordered the 43 once sirloin for the table of 4.  It was cooked on the rare side and lacked flavor overall. But once you added the salt, cheese, jus, it was pretty good! Service was prompt and friendly. Not my favourite place but it was ice to try it out."}
{"text":"Sunday was my younger sisters 21st birthday and we decided to celebrate in style by visiting Daish?, the gorgeous family style asian fushion restaurant created by mastermind Chef David Chang! If you've never had the experience of visiting the Momofuku \"complex\" I suggest you take it in. They've got a style of dining and a price point for every taste and budget. From the noodle bar on the main floor up to the tasting menus of Shoto, you really cannot go wrong.

We were a table of 8 so family style was definitely the way to go for this special occasion. We had a great corner table with tons of windows to look out over University Ave with, the views of the city are beautiful at night - even from only 4 floors up. The decor throughout is modern and minimalistic, with a few really nice wow factors!

For food, I was tasked (as the family Yelp guy) with making food and wine selections for the table, a stressful task for any family - made worse only by a table of hungry and edgy Italians. I got the ball rolling with the help of the in house Sommelier and ordered a Portuguese White Wine and a Tuscan Red (both approx. $70/bottle). The wines were outstanding, the white was light and citrusy.. a little floral and the slightest hint of carbonation which died off as the bottle was consumed. The red was a medium body, easy drinker (too easy). Our table easily polished off 2 bottles of each before the night was over.

For starters, our table drooled over the large seafood platter option, so we decided to go with that to share and add an eggplant Bao and fired chicken bao each. We also had the apple kimchi salad (really good, think apples covered in kimchi glaze), the ox tail agnolotti (a delicious dish, but not friendly for sharing), the duck and pork sausage (same comments as the ox tail)The buns were unreal, perfect snack size and you could easily just go for plates of those and pair it with wines and all would be good in your life. The seafood platter was a total and complete ripoff. I won't mince words folks. It came with crab legs, oysters, shrimp, arctic char tartar and a veggie of sorts, it sounds like a lot but you were luck to have 12 of each item.. maybe. The portion of tartar barely made it around the table once at a small spoonful each. Absolutely NOT worth the price point and I strongly encourage management to re-evaluate their pricing on this. Our entire table was disappointed with this option. I'd avoid at all costs... what's worse is the smaller platter (priced at $96) provides about 6 of each piece. I was embarrassed at my failure in ordering this.

I knew I needed to make up for my (and the restaurants) appetizer faux-pas on the seafood with our shared main course selections, so I worked with our server - who was extremely helpful ensuring we had enough to go around from then on, and crafter a stellar sharing menu that had everyone stuffed by the end. Here is a list of what we had:

Shared Mains: 
Roasted rice cakes -  spicy pork sausage, chinese broccoli, tofu 17
Secreto ss√§m - apple mustard mayo, bibb lettuce 26
Muscovy duck - turnip, cranberry, confit 38
Roasted pickerel - guanciale, water chestnut, red shiso  29
2x hanger steak ss√§m - kimchi, onion, bibb lettuce 26

Shared Sides:
2x nugget potatoes - togarashi, kewpie mayo, spiced ham 12
kale - sweet onion, beer, maple syrup 14
brussels sprouts - fish sauce, puffed rice, mint 12
cauliflower bhaji - lime pickle, green chili vinegar, cilantro  12

Rather than go through each item, I will call out my faves from each category. For mains, the Duck, and Hanger Steak were outstanding, blew everyone away. The ability to make bib lettuce wraps with the steak was incredible and delicious, the meat was so tender and well marinated! For the sides, the Brussel sprouts had us fighting amongst ourselves and the potatoes were easily the side of the night. A stone cold stunner of a dish.

It was certainly not a cheap meal but we had anticipated this in advance and aside from the fail on the fish platter it was worth every penny spent. 

I'd love to come back another time and eat a smaller sample from their other restaurants, specifically the main floor noodle bar (mmm ramen), AND my brother and I have made it our life goal to come back and share a 52oz steak together - it takes an hour to cook and will likely cost north of $300, but F-it #Yolo right!

Thanks for a great night MMFKo D!

{"text":"Heard about this place and was in the area and decided to walk in .

So we step in to check it out and wait for a hostess to help seat us .

We had a few questions as this place runs as 3 different restaurants and is individually listed on yelp as well. 

Our interest was about Daisho (3rd floor)and we had asked about a menu item which the hostess was clueless about. After her struggles she calls Daisho with no luck of ever hearing about it. So she suggests we proceed upstairs and and ask them directly and describe the dish we clearly showed them on instagram .

Overall this place is not in harmony and even Daisho had difficulty recognizing the dish for several minutes. . Finally when it was revealed they had told us its only available for lunch which is fair.

So we decided to make reservations at Daisho for a later date. A few days before our reservation we decided to call and confirm if the menu will be the same on the day of our reserved lunch. . The person who answered the phone still did not know of the menu and says it may change and then eventually after checking with her kitchen staff told us it would be the same. 

So after continuous struggles they still had one up their sleeve.

So Day the before our lunch they had called us. We had a missed the call and also no voicemail was left. We called back and said someone had called us and the response was \" we don't know why someone would call you \" 

We asked if it was about our reservation and the response was \" I don't know\" instead of checking and being courteous .

So we have decided not to give them a chance as it would feel like it wasn't completely a true experience."}
{"text":"We gathered together a group of ten for the bo ssam and wow, what a fun experience. There's just something about having a five-pound piece of meat plopped down in the center of the table that makes you know it's going to be a fun night. You DO have to order the bo ssam and a few other dishes ahead of time, so don't think that you can just drop in to Daisho and replicate our experience.

It's worth mentioning that this place is *very* trendy. I feel like a small-town imposter every time I come in here. Plan for nice jeans and a shirt at a minimum.

The pork was amazing - sweet, salty and chewy on the outside and tender and flavourful on the inside. We were able to dig in with tongs and pull the whole thing apart until only a bone remained. Granted, we reduced it to the bone with some effort, though, even with ten stomachs to fill!

Along with the bo ssam we ordered every vegetable side dish (five or six dishes), all of which were very good, if a little expensive. If there had only been a few of us we would never have ordered them all, but once it was split ten ways it was worth a couple bucks per person to try each one. The best ones were the brussels sprouts and the sunchokes. 

The oysters were perfect (as they should be). The server suggested adding one to a wrap with the pork and kimchi, but after trying that once I stuck with topping them with a little kimchi, green onion and hot sauce and slurping them back on their own.

Once you're in a big group it's also a good idea (and sort of awesome) to order a gallon of beer. The beer selection is very good, we had the Evil Twin pale ale and it was a crowd pleaser and kept us to around $6/person for beer.

Overall we were able to do all of this for $50/person including tax and tip, which is more than I'd typically spend on dinner but definitely not unreasonable for a nice meal, especially given the celebrity-chef status of the restaurant owner.

There are a few things that would have bumped this up to five stars for me: First, it seems as though you can get refills on the lettuce and possibly the kimchi with the bo ssam, but this was never offered to us and we ran out of both very quickly (the kimchi almost immediately and the lettuce before we finished a quarter of the meat) it would have been nice for our server to at least offer to refill them, even if we'd've had to pay (which would be a little much at $240 for the meal, but we would have considered it at least for the kimchi.)

Second, in spite of having made a reservation several weeks in advance, we waited over half an hour for our table, and when it wasn't ready we were uncerimoniously shuffled off back down to the cocktail level. We recently had this problem with a smaller group at Au Pied de Cochon in Montreal and were treated to a round of drinks and an appetizer on the house. I know it's Toronto, not Montreal, but some sort of gesture from the staff for our wait would have been nice and bumped them up to five stars. 

At any rate, in spite of it all it was a really fun experience I wouldn't hestiate to do again. Please bring the Korean-fried chicken to Toronto, Momofuku, so we can try your fried chicken dinner, too!"}
{"text":"Service was good and staff are friendly and helpful.  There were hits and misses with the food. 

Complimentary pickled cucumbers were a nice a start to snack on. 

Chicken buns were good but there are more flavourful and less costly options especially in Toronto. 

Pumpkin agnolotti is something worth trying. The perfectly brunoised pumpkin was a textural contrast to the filled pasta. 

Crispy cauliflower are also worth ordering. The charred pieces are satisfying even for non veggie eaters. 

The grilled Miami ribs were tender but the turnip cake that came with it was a bit strange. Definitely avoid that part. 

Lastly the lemon meringue tart was not good. The lemon custard part tasted more like a dense sponge cake. Not sure if this was intentional but I wouldn't recommend ordering this at all."}
{"text":"First time to Daisho.  We arrived 15 min prior to our reservation time and they weren't ready so we had to have a drink at the bar downstairs.  We had a nice seat in the corner of the restaurant where you can see up University Ave.  We selected the 3 course New Year's Eve $75/pp 3 course meal.  Started with some amuse dishes, mini spring rolls which were ok and a raw oyster per person. Our appetizers were nice, I had fluke which was like sashimi and husband had squash salad.  Nice flavours.  Entrees we had the crispy halibut and rib eye.  Nice entrees, portions were okay.  Sides were Brussels sprouts but I couldn't figure out where the Brussels sprouts were in the side dish unless they separated the leaves.  It had nice mushrooms in it.  Other side was creamy sweet potato which was nice.  Dessert was a rum cake that was to share."}
{"text":"We booked a table for 9 for my friend's bachelor party. When I arrived( I live in DT so I was the first one arrived) I was told that we cannot be seated unless 9 of us are here together...... Three of my friend arrived 5 min later than me, we were on high heel and stood in front of the elevator for like 20 min... 

Finally seated, the food is beyond terrible....I have no idea why a high-end restaurant would provide such bad service and terrible food. 

I won't recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place, so we came here with a positive mindset, but we were thoroughly disappointed. 

It took over 50 minutes for us to get the appetizer. Server #1 said that they had burnt the toast of the kimchi toast... When we finally got the dish, I thought it was such a bizarre combination (cheese and broccoli kimchi on a soggy toast). 

Then came the mains. The rice cake dish was very off-putting. It was Korean rice cakes with some sort of creamy ragu pasta sauce. We left more than half of the dish uneaten, and server #2 took it away.

We also had a fried fish dish, after a single bite, we noticed a blueish/purple-ish hair in it (so obviously not our hair). Server #3 saw this, and said \"let me take care of that for you\" and took the dish away. A long wait later, we get a new dish back, but this time the portion is significantly smaller, less bok choy, and without the lime garnish. We were still charged for it as usual.

Finally, the dessert. The peach yogurt ice cream was half melted by the time they served it. The strawberry \"shortcake\" was some modern interpretation with crispy butter cookies. I didn't think it worked well since the cookie was too think and crispy to absorb any of the juices from the strawberries, the way a normal strawberry shortcake would. The couple sitting next to us also disliked the dish.

Service was very slow; the whole ordeal took over 3.5 hours! We're very fast ordering and fast eating, and we didn't even get drinks. Because 3 different servers took turns serving us, they didn't see how bad of an experience we had. When server #1 brought our bill to us, he didn't even ask us if we enjoyed our visit. We felt awkward about complaining, so we paid, tipped, and left."}
{"text":"I had the summerlicious menu and overall, everything tasted great and the servers were friendly and attentive. I started off with the Karaage Bun, then had the grilled trout, followed by a strawberry Shortcake (with some amuse bouche in between which was a nice touch!) Everything was presented nicely and tasted great. My only complaint is that the portions were tiny. It could have just been their summerlicious portions but I left hungry after a 3 course meal. It was a little pricey for a $45 prix fixe."}
{"text":"This place is attached to shangri-la where we stayed for our wedding. 

Fantastic service- kept the kitchen open for us even though we arrived just after 10pm. 

MUST HAVES

Complimentary cucumbers - ask for more if you love these. A bit of chili added to the super crunchy cucumbers. Excellent. 

Pork and chive dumplings - great texture and balance of flavors. Has a slight shrimp paste taste in it (I probably prefer them without the shrimp to which I am slightly allergic) but still delicious. 

SOLID
Heirloom tomatoes - right tomatoes with a bit of crunchy onions on top (I think). I would have prefer it without too much of the tomato juice. 

Chicken buns - I always love the buns from momofuku and this one was no exception!

SKIP
Pork ribs - super salty. Not edible unless you have rice with this."}
{"text":"We managed to snag Winterlicious dinner reservations here at Momofuku Daisho last night. 

Based on the mediocre yelp reviews for Daisho, our expectations for the food weren't very high, but I have to say we were pleasantly surprised! 

What we ate (Winterlicious menu for two ($45/pp): 

Steamed Buns (2 buns) (10/10) : 1. Crispy Chicken Bao and 2. Beef Tongue Bao - The buns were soft and moist. The chicken was crispy and well-seasoned. Beef Tongue was tender. 

Warm Squash Salad (vegetarian/local) (10/10) - First time having squash prepared this way, I'm going to guess it was baked and then pan grilled for the extra texture. Warm salad dish with a lightly paired dressing.  

Pork Shank (10/10) - deliciously flaky pork shank pieces engulfed in turnip, black garlic and cilantro. Authentic fusion of flavours that tastes like a dish my mom would make! 

Roasted Haddock (6/10) - This was a battered haddock dish served with pressed cabbage. I wouldn't say this dish was overly exciting and it was definitely leaning on the dry side. We found ourselves double dipping the fish in the tartar sauce. 

Date Pudding (vegetarian/local) (10/10) - The name of this dessert is deceiving, it is more of a chocolate/date cake drizzled with butterscotch, five spice, clotted cream. Moist and not too sweet! Order this if you're a fan of warm goodness. 

Chocolate (10/10) -All I can say was that there was a party happening in my mouth. Chocolate, frozen mousse, brownie and toasted rice. So much sweet, textured goodness happening all at once. Order this!

Addition: 
Roasted rice cakes (7/10) ($17)- Korean Rice cakes with spicy pork sausage, chinese broccoli and tofu - We ordered this after we asked our server what dish is a \"must try\". It wasn't bad, but it also isn't something we would rave about. The dish was a twist on the classic Korean Rice Cake dish. The main difference is the texture of the rice cakes, they're rolled on a flat grill to add an extra crew. It reminds me of the chewy texture of the burnt rice along the edges of a Hot Stone Rice Pot you can order at a Chinese restaurant.  The dish was different, although tad on the salty spectrum. I think I'll stick to the classic rice cake dish from Ktown. It's still worth a try if you've never had rice cakes with the roast/grilled chewy texture. 

Overall, we really enjoyed our experience. Food was delicious, service was fantastic, and atmosphere was super hip. Those who have food allergies, fear not as death by shellfish won't happen under the watchful chefs at Momo. 

Summary:
Food (9/10) - Besides the minor preferences we had for the rice cake and haddock dishes, the food was delicious..

Service (10/10) - Water service on point. Friendly and well dressed staff. Every dish brought out was thoroughly explained. 

Atmosphere (10/10) - Neat fishbowl architecture. No need to request for a window seat as the entire restaurant is glass box that overlooks University Avenue. Hip Scene. 

ProTip:  Get seated at the bar. Although it may be slightly uncomfortable to sit on bar stools all night, you'll be in the presence of great company. The bartender is fantastic, she'll keep your water full and tell you about the poor tattoo decisions she's made. Ask her about the tattoo behind her right ear. 

Eat here."}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere are awesome. But I go to restaurants for the food and this place was a disappointment. Hot wing buns were sub par and tasted like they had straight up ketchup in them. Actually took them off out bill cause they left a bone in mine(was nice that they saw the bone and took them off the bill immediately, I didn't have to say a word. Rice cakes, secreto, monkfish were below par. Sub par food and outrageous prices equals unhappy Foodsnob."}
{"text":"David Chang said there's nothing like Momofuku in Toronto, and he's probably right. The steady decline of his restaurant since its inception is spectacular. On our last visit (the fifth since it opened), the whole speckled trout was overcooked and dry, the dry aged beef ribeye was all fat, raw and hardly edible, and the crack pie was dry. But to add insult to injury the service was intolerable. After being seated, we found that our napkins were damp. The waiter questioned our observation and grudgingly replaced them. Service was inattentive and we had to flag down servers to refill our drinks. The bill for 4 people was almost $600 with wine. Sadly, there was nothing to encourage our return."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night with five other people.  We had a lovely evening. The fried chicken was delicious and wine selection was phenom.  We ordered a Sauvignon Blanc from Sancerre and a Pinot Noir from Languedoc which suited our tastes.  The server told us we are welcome to accompany the large format with additional a la carte sharing items but warned us from ordering too much as the large format fried chicken was quite substantial portion wise for the table.  We had the Brussels, rice cakes and Truffle Dumplings which were beautifully presented and all very unique and full of flavour.

When we were nearing the end of our meal we noticed a commotion from a large table.  I believe it is the table that Fiorella is talking about in this forum.  I have to say, it was most disruptive to hear the commotion coming from this table.  When they were first sat, we overheard a girl from the table tell their server that their table was on a tight budget.  Then at the end of the meal we found out that the commotion was caused by a supposed \"hair\" that was embedded in their pork dish.  Given what I had initially overheard about the table's budget, I was flabbergasted that someone would have the audacity to go to these great lengths to get a bill reduced. 
In any case, our table had an amazing time.  We didn't get to have dessert because of the embarrassing commotion going on next to our table. All in all, beautiful ambience, beautifully presented food and definitely surpassed our expectations.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"As foodie tv watchers, we had to try Momofuku on our layover in Toronto. Our plane was delayed so we missed our reservation but they were kind enough to let us  dine anyway.

The cucumber salad was a nice appetizer to get us ready for our meal. We ordered the duck wontons which were good but missing something my tongue kept searching for the \"bam\".

After our wontons, We sat and waited for 30 minutes before our waiter even mentioned that the food would be out.. it took another 10 for it to actually come out. That is why I docked a star.

Bbq skane wings: admittedly i thought i was ordering chicken  but the fish like filet was delicious though something about the bbq sauce was too strong for me so I scraped some off. The kale And edamame and crisp sticky rice were a perfect combination.

Pork dish: delicious but Very acidic. The little rice cubes were a great touch. My bf enjoyed it very much, I liked it but didnt love it.

Overall, we are glad to have tried it. I am disappointed in the wait time between finishing an appetizer and getting our main courses, but being on a plane for 9 hours and severly underdressed the wait staff were very kind to us."}
{"text":"Writing my very first asian foodie review: Momofuku Daisho - Toronto.

Arrived early for our lunchtime Summerlicious reservations. After taking some photos in front of the building, my wife and I waited in the small lobby area. Restaurant opened its doors promptly at 11:30am - as posted on the door.

We were the first to arrive on the 3rd floor and the hostess seated us right away. We were given the best view, right beside the windows for both of us to see in either direction.

After looking at the menu, our waitress gave us short and sweet answers (but very descriptive!) to our many questions: what to order, how much extra it would cost, portion size, explanation of ingredients. Her service was fantastic from beginning to end.
The food: absolutely delicious! I can say that my wife and I had a hard time finishing our dishes. Although we both shared one another's dishes to experience all the flavours but we barely finished off our desserts. That is how well Momofuku Daisho serves their food. 

The only comment I would make about having a great view of the street with a corner table is that the other two tables next to and behind us was an obstacle. The servers trying to reach our table constantly had to ask the two gentlemen from the other tables to excuse themselves as they tried to serve our dishes or clear our plates. I didn't mind passing our plates and cutlery to them but at times felt somewhat awkard that I nearly grazed the hair on their head.

The service was spectacular, the food was exemplary, and the ambience was just right. Thank you Momofuku Daisho for making my trip downtown an experience I won't forget."}
{"text":"We are huge fans of Nikai.  Daisho was doing a brunch- now I'm not sure if this is a regular thing, but if it is I highly recommend. Just like anything else with David Chang's name on it the brunch was fabulous. 

Even with out religious restrictions (it was Passover) they accommodated us and were happy to do so.  

Everything that came to us was cooked to perfection and worked so well, even with our  modifications.

Not to mention, the open concept can't be beat.  Love it."}
{"text":"Definitely a trendy restaurant - the first Momofuku (branch) in Canada.

Daish? is set in a minimalist glass cube, with simple yet elegant wooden benches and tables filling the dining room, perched over University Avenue in downtown Toronto. The three-storied Momocomplex is also home to Noodle Bar (1st floor), Nikai (2nd floor lounge bar), and Sh?t? (a tasting menu-only dining facility, located behind the Daish? dining room on the third floor). The loud party dining scene, in and of itself, is worth checking out.

My partner and I visited Daish? for dinner, and we ordered from their a la carte menu. There were many different dishes to sample and share, served family style. The menu featured a lot of seasonal Ontario ingredients, fused with the Chang-American-Asian style that he is known for originating in New York City. All in all, the dishes sampled were unique enough, some a little too salty for my liking, but, these things happen. Their wine list has a lot of local and international gems to pair with the flavourful dishes on offer, as well as quality Ontario craft brews, with a few off-beat sake selections, too."}
{"text":"It`s eating at restaurants like Daisho that makes me miss living in Toronto!  Having relocated to Edmonton, every time I return to Toronto my heart is warmed with the plethora of dining experiences the city has to offer. 

Four of us dined at Daisho recently, enjoying our meal in the glass room that overhangs the street below.  The feeling of peering down on the cars and people passing by is quite enjoyable.

We started the evening off with drinks, each of us trying something different.  The favourite amongst the table was `Smoke and Mirrors` which was the strongest of the bunch we tried.  The Citrus Hystrix on the other hand was sweet, and comments at the table included that it was reminiscent of cough syrup.

Daisho serves up dishes which are perfect for sharing, so each of us picked two items, and we added in a few sides.  The pretzel bread with mustard and pork fat was an excellent starter, the mustard was dry-hot and to die for.  

From the etc. section of the menu, we tried the Burger Bun, Falafel Bun and Sausage.  All were delicious, and the buns are so delightfully airy, you can`t help but want more!

We ordered the monkfish and the pickerel from the fish menu, and the monkfish was a favourite around the table.  

Of the meats, we decided to go with the chicken thigh, which we made into wraps with the lettuce provided.  The sriracha and mushrooms made for the perfect toppings.  We also had the lamb saddle which was very tender.  The fresh peas were an excellent accent to this dish.  

The side that we tried was the corn- it was very sweet, and quite tasty.  However, it was agreed round the table that we`d probably skip sides in the future and just order the main dishes.

We ordered one of each of the desserts for the table, and the strawberry shortcake was the favourite.  The crack pie was delicious as well, but it might have been a bit sweet after having so many other dishes and drinks throughout the evening.

The service was great, the waitress was really helpful with her suggestions and did a great job of spacing out our orders so that we could enjoy a few dishes at a time.  

After our Daisho experience, we`re excited to try the other Momofuku restaurants next time we return to Toronto!"}
{"text":"Very overrated. I was expecting a bit more subtlety in the preparatiin, but it looks like the chef gets away with taste by frying a lot and drowning as much as possible in japanese mayo and green onions. Not worth the hype."}
{"text":"Amazing service! I came here for Winterlicious 2017 and our reservation got delayed 30 minutes, so they treated us to lunch. The food was great. I ordered the potato soup, steamed clams, and got chocolate for dessert. Great service, great atmosphere, and great food. 

Recommend to everyone :)"}
{"text":"The shrimp bun was good.  Everything else was barely average.  It is supposed to be Korean fusion.  It just did not hit the mark for me.  Had the Secreto Ssam.  Eh.  Spent over $120 and was not impressed.  I expect better from Momofuku and for the price."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal at momofuku daisho! The menu is short and simple. And the food is a mishmash of Korean, Japanese, Chinese and North American and really delicious. The Ssam sets are really good and the condiments are presented in a true to traditional yet inventive ways. The buns are so yummy and delicious. The rice cakes are also yummy- this is such a korean staple that is lesser known outside of korea and everyone who's tried rice cakes love 'em. 
My favourite dish of the evening was the dessert! I think honestly, I would have rated this review with 4 stars if I hadn't tried the dessert. I got the citrus and it was awesome. I can't even explain what this really was but it's was lightly citrus-y and was presented in various textures- some sort of a cream cheese citrus mousse, a dollop of light citrus infused creamy sorbet among some sort of really subtle citric thin jelly/gooey squared adorned the bottom of the plate- this is the best explanation I can do. It's a must try even if you don't really like citric things. It's very subtle and so delightful."}
{"text":"Daisho was a great experience; not only was the food delicious, the service was outstanding. Our waitress was super friendly and seemed to know the menu/ingredients really well. She started us off with some in-house peach ale and the Winter Blossom mixed drink (cranberry juice, vermouth and lemon--highly recommend) and then brought out our pre-ordered Bo Sam dinner for 12, featuring a 8-hr roasted pork shoulder. This was served with a variety of sauces and sides (marinated cucumber chunks, steamed white rice, kimchi) to be eaten as a lettuce wrap.  Though the ingredients were so simple, they were very high quality and super fresh, bringing out the pork really well. 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Five stars for this amazing summerlicous experience. Made a late mid week reservation here for me and my friends to finally try the famous momofuku. It is on the third floor with a very nice view of the financial district. The natural light coming in really illuminated the restaurant. There was a bit of a wait for our table but it is very limited seating. We waited at the bar and ordered the summerlicious white wine special which was really great. Not overly dry or sweet. Once seated we quickly ordered our meals. We got an amuse bouche which was a pea soup. It was nice and warm and not overpowered by the taste of the peas. Very yummy. I started with the steamed buns for my appetizer choice. They were both insanely delish! One was a falafel and the other was a crispy chicken. Honestly I could have had it as my meal as it was very filling. The sauce inside was very tasty and flavored well. For my main I had the beef which came with rice and salad. It was so good. I was in heaven. Cooked to perfection and complimented so well with all the ingredients. They gave us a palette cleanser before dessert which was a licorice flavored whipped cream. It was not my cup of tea at all but it did not ruin my experience and it's also super tiny. I got the chocolate mousse with Chantilly cream and churros. It was amazinggggg. Such a huge portion and good to the last drop. The combination of all 3 was heaven. The service was impeccable and friendly from beginning to end. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We had one open night on our visit to Toronto so we decided to check out Momofuku Daisho. You will note that the menu, online or in hand, is not particularly informative. Also, you will like to know that groups of two will not actually get a table but will be sitting at the bar. Which is all right, though the bar is a pretty active environment with all the drink-making going on. At first glance the prices may knock you on the floor; as the realization sets in that some of the dishes are family style and priced accordingly you recalibrate (a little). We had two \"appetizers,\" which were in fact huge: the delicious rice cake dumplings in a buttery black sesame seed sauce with thinly sliced fresh black truffle atop, and the astonishing grilled Chinese cabbage. Our bartender, Robin, was especially helpful in explaining these items; without the explanation, for example, you might wonder why they were charging $36 for a bowl of duk (Korean cylindrical rice cakes), but once you knew there were truffles all over them you would understand. Although I must say that the truffles themselves were a bit of a non-event, kind of like sliced brown wax with just the mildest hint of taste. The cabbage was an entrancing symphony of flavors, having been soaked in a kind of kalbi marinade before an enthusiastic grilling and then creamed up, with some pine nuts and a sweet vinegar. The second half of the meal was not up to the same exciting level. We had the halibut cheek, very lightly breaded and pan-fried, and unfortunately kind of dry. We liked the stringy texture of the cheek in principle but it ended up lackluster, as in: why am I eating this. The wd-50 chicken was similarly unsuccessful; a pucker-your-mouth too-brined chicken roll-up covered with a fried chicken skin, over an egg yolk serving as mock gravy, with thin chips of evaporated mole sauce; sounds cool but sadly a chore to get through; it would not be possible to drink enough liquid to happily get this down. The portions of both entrees were generous, however. And the cucumber salad was nice. So, call it an interesting experiment, for $200 bucks or so for 2 foodies."}
{"text":"I LOVE MOMOFUKO DAISHO!!!!

I went on Saturday night. Got a last minute reservation for 945. The table was ready upon arrival. We sat by the window with a nice view of the city. I liked the atmosphere. Relaxed and simple. Elegant and chic. 

The server was friendly and helpful and assisted us in selecting a sake and made some other food suggestions. 

We had: 

The Fois Gras - This is unique in that it is frozen and shaved over top of candied cashews, Riesling jelly, and another delicious ingredient which is escaping me right now. This is AMAZING! I've never had fois gras this way and I LOVED IT. The presentation, the flavours, DELISH! This is a pretty sweet appetizer and it was recommended as a desert, but I really wanted to try \"crack pie\".

The swordfish - Another winner, though may have been slightly over cooked. 

The steak - I thought this was amazing, my boyfriend thought it had been marinated too long. It is very flavourful. 

The Sides. OH THE SIDES!
We had:
The mushrooms - YES OMG YES! Bread crumbs take this to the next level. 
The Brussels Sprouts - BEST BRUSSELS SPROUTS EVER! and a huge portion. 

Crack pie for desert - I usually don't eat desert, but had to try this. I can see how it got its name. Very sweet. Very yummy. 

I will definitely return to Momofuko Daisho. I loved it! I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to a conference in Toronto last week, and as much as I was excited to explore a city I'd never visited before, I was also thrilled to find there was a Momofukuplex like a block from my hotel. I went for lunch at Momofuku Daish? last Thursday (and the Noodle Bar Friday--not bad for conference food). It was my first Momofuku experience outside of New York, and I was glad to find that the quality was up to David Chang's usual standards. This was a lovely meal.

Daish? is on the third floor of a glass cube building devoted to Momofuku endeavors. It seems to be the Ssam equivalent, fancier than Noodle Bar, but still casual and more affordable than the fine dining restaurant (in Toronto, this would be Sh?t?). It was a great place for lunch, an attractive space with simple, modern decor and plenty of natural light. We were able to walk in just before 1:00 on a Thursday with a party of four. Service was solid, and we enjoyed a pleasant, leisurely meal.

There was a full bar, so I had a cocktail with my lunch. I ordered the Nuts n Bolts, a smooth, soothing drink made with bourbon, hazelnut, and lemon. Not a traditional day drink, but it was pretty ideal. I'd definitely order it again if I had the chance.

The food was excellent, beginning with a complimentary bowl of vinegary Japanese-style cucumber pickles. We decide to share everything, which is the way to go here--lots of interesting, easy-to-split dishes on the menu. (I also noticed Daish? does large format dining--haven't done it here, obviously, but I'd recommend both the bo ss√§m based on  We started with the chicken buns (for the famous pork buns, go downstairs to the Noodle Bar), and these were fantastic. The chicken was breaded and fried, kind of orange chicken style but with a mildly Koreanized buffalo chicken flavor profile, with ss√§m sauce, pickled carrots, and scallions on fluffy white buns.

All four of us wanted the shrimp stack burger--we were about to order one each and call it a day when we decided this would be a wasted opportunity. We ordered two of them instead, getting them cut in half, and supplemented with a grilled chicken sandwich and brussels sprouts. The shrimp stack lived up to its promise. It was an extraordinary burger, apparently born from a Shake Shack collaboration that generated the longest lines in Shake Shack's history (which is full of ridiculously long lines). It was a juicy cheeseburger with a beef patty, a shrimp patty, hozon mayo (Momofuku's own umami-rich miso sauce), lettuce, tomato, and pickled onions, served with a fresh kohlrabi slaw and tempura onion rings. It was as flavorful and delicious as it sounds. The grilled chicken sandwich was also great, tender chicken with kimchi, belle cheese, and tomato on focaccia. The brussels sprouts made for a wonderful side, beautifully crisped and saucy, with fish sauce, puffed rice, and mint.

There's something about Momofuku restaurants that makes people like to give them bad Yelp reviews. I know that some of these are probably valid, but there's no way Daish? is a 3.5-star restaurant on a normal curve. If you live in Toronto, don't hesitate to come here and come here often. I'd even recommend it to tourists, particularly if you're not heading to New York any time soon."}
{"text":"Bumping to a 1.5 for decor and layout.

I feel it a bit unfair to judge a restaurant by a Summerlicious menu, but if you're going to bother running a special like this, it ought to be at least decent. This was one of the most expensive and underwhelming meals I've ever had. Thank goodness the company and the lovely ambiance made up for it.

David Chang says that 'The Yelp reviews are wrong. They just are'. David Chang should be ashamed to be charging $45 for this 'special' menu. I've worked in the industry for over 25 years-- front and back of house and I am an accomplished home cook. I can say, without a doubt that this food is not even close to something I'd serve at home on a weeknight for dinner. 

They state that the menu is 5 courses. Not. 

My pisco sour was tasty, but very small.

The 1st amusee bouche is a little squirt of potato salad on a spoon with some fresh dill and some sort of foam. Tasty, but badly presented. At this point, I'm picturing all the food lined up in the prep kitchen, pre made and ready to go out.

Our appetizer choices were the radish salad and the Philly Bun. Don't order the radish salad unless you have an absurd love for radishes. It's ALL radish and very overwhelming. I like strong flavours, but this was one of the most unbalanced salads I've ever had. My friend couldn't finish it and it actually stunk. The Philly bun was nicely steamed with tender meat and a spicy sauce. This was easily the highlight of the meal. But very mediocre by overall standards.

My friend ordered the chicken and the portion size was shameful and consisted of a stuffed chicken breast (probbaly a 1/4 of a breast in total) and very little else. It tasted ok, with a nice sear on the outside and the chicken was tender but I'm guessing it cost the restaurant about $4.00 to put this dish out.

I love my meat, but wanted to try the Somen noodles with Chanterelles. Noodles in broth are a cornerstone of Asian cuisine and I was excited give Chang's dish a go. What a complete waste. The dish was tiny as could be and was nothing more than a pool of rice wine vinegar with sugar and water with some peas, chanterelles that seemed reconstituted, and some very bland somen noodles with micro greens scattered on top. This dish was unbelievably bad, but since the portion was so small, I managed to finish it. I still can't believe I paid for this. It tasted like dirty, weedy water.

The trout that arrived at the table beside us was miniscule and could not have been more than two and a half ounces.

Then a blueberry gel appeared with goat cheese yogurt. You'd think this would be ok, but the square of blueberry confection was far too sweet and cloying for the tangy yogurt that would have been nice had it been highlighted with the blueberry's fruity flavour than all that sugar.

Dessert was another fail. I had the ice cream sandwich with marshmallows and chocolate. The cookie was so hard that it was impossible to cut through the dessert without sending the food rocketing off the plate. Again-- far too sweet. 

The service left much to be desired, as well. Our server looked like he just came from the skate park. Don't get me wrong-- skaters are super hot, but I don't expect them to be serving me a $45 dinner after skating all day. Pull up your pants, young man! He was greasy and covered in what I hope, was food. If you are expecting fine dining service, this is not it. They were okay with water refills, but could have made more money off us if they had asked if we wanted something else to drink.

Points here are for the decor and the lovely view of the city we had. If you want to be scene, and I mean 'scene' not 'seen', then come here. If you actually like food, forget it. This place has about as much to do with food as a photo book full of anorexics. 

Honestly, what's going on with the good reviews of this place? I feel incredibly ripped off by this sad menu. It really is sad. I would recommend staying home and having popcorn for dinner instead of these offerings. Save yourself $44.50 plus tax and gratuity."}
{"text":"I visited Daisho with a party of ten for my birthday. We purposely did not order a group dish in advance because we like ordering many things and sharing. Upon arrival, our server was so aggressive and basically forced us into ordering a large piece of prime rib for the whole table, even though we made it really clear that we wanted to order separate things and share. 
The food at Daisho is good, but the service was shockingly bad. When you're paying that much for a meal with a pretty large group, you expect to be served exactly what you want. The restaurant is beautiful, the food is interesting and different, but the service is very poor. I will not be returning to Daisho."}
{"text":"The staff gets an A plus but the food gets a C minus.
   As good as the staff is can't recommend this place.  The food was very mediocre and I wouldn't have minded so much but it was way over priced for what you get. Spent over a 100$ dollars left very disappointed.  One of the terrible stand outs was the kimchi apple salad, a great example of Asian fusion done wrong."}
{"text":"Delicious. Highly recommend as many others have the rice cakes and brussel sprouts. The crispy chicken buns were a perfect appetizer. Also tried the kale; it didn't shine as much as the other dishes so try something else. Had the La Preta cocktail which was dangerously good; refreshing with a bit of a kick at the end from the chili. If you have room for dessert the coconut and blood orange sorbet was to die for. There s a cookie on the bottom that took the sorbet to the next level! All the dishes were extremely flavorful with gorgeous presentation. Service was friendly, efficient and knowledgeable. Lived up to the hype! Only tricky part is parking. Had to circle around to find street parking, so just leave yourself a little extra time."}
{"text":"Great food, but the dessert is just okay.

Would be nice if a set of chopstick rest is provided."}
{"text":"I'd just like to follow up from an earlier review about Momofuku though this time it concerns Daisho not Noodle Bar. A big thank you to Jordana, Jay, Jeff and Jake who made this experience memorable (This is a team of J's!!). After not being very happy with my first experience in the \"glass box\" I returned a few months later to dine upstairs in Daisho. Definitely more my style with the traditional tables and full bar in sight. The service was definitely the highlight of the evening. The manager Jeff was very friendly and insightful regarding the menu and our options and our server Jake took that to the next level with his friendly demeanour and fun interaction in delivering us a seamless experience. My favourites food wise were definitely the Chicken Buns and the Brussel Sprouts. Delish! The rest of the food we ordered included the Char tartare and the pork and leek dumplings as well as the Rice Cracker dish, which is unique to them with pork sausage in it. While they were all good, I would personally come back for the buns and sprouts. My husband enjoyed the Rice Cracker dish, which is quite filling and filled with spices and flavour. We will be back for sure maybe this time during lunch or brunch (we came for dinner) given the beautiful room and lightning they have sitting in the main artery of Toronto. Thank you Team Daisho! Till we meet again."}
{"text":"Very pricey and the food was alright. It didn't blow my mind, but the prices were so high that I was expecting it to be amazing.  
The eggplant buns are fantastic though!
The service was mediocre. Our water was consistently filled but it was difficult getting the waiters attention to order or ask for anything... 
The restaurant itself was beautiful and had a nice atmosphere to it."}
{"text":"My friend ordered an entr√©e of scallops for $36 dollars for a portion that was about the size of my palm and the taste was hardly worth the cost. The rest of the food was similarly underwhelming and overpriced."}
{"text":"We were running 15 mins late as we were driving in from the states. I called and told them, they said it would not be an issue. We wanted to get there as soon as possible as there was a show we would be headed to just after. 

The decor was nice, but a little sparse.  Modern Asian feel. On the third floor with a view of University. 

We were greeted by rudeness and pretentiousness that continued through dinner.  Told that we were late and we were expected to give up our table at 7 as we were late!  Though we called and the place was empty when we arrived. And when we finished at 6:59, just in the nick of time before the table police got us, the tables were half full. Could have been said a thousand ways better than it was. 

Funny how they price steaks as it is a per ounce price. For instance, their Ribeye, which other reviews casually mention would be just too much to eat between two people. Well, they price it at $4.50CA an oz. Fair enough...so we ordered 10 ounces to share along with the dumplings, rapini, Brussels sprouts and the like. The waiter loved telling us the cuts only come in 38oz. portions in a condescending tone after I foolishly ordered 10oz. 

1) if my math is correct, that is a $171.00ca steak, which for two people is ludicrous, maybe for 3 or four people after what it looks like with the bone out and cut up. Must be an impressive piece of meat
2) if it is a $171.00ca steak and you can only order it at 38oz.  Why the hell price it $4.50 an oz., other to come across a pretentious to the one ordering. So often, the person ordering for the first time, must then feel pressured to continue with that order if he/ she is with someone new and does not want to come across as cheap. Price your $171ca steak at $171ca and move on!

The food was tasty but as my GF and I said the next day, the pretentiousness underwhelmed and we were talking about that as to the tasty Brussels sprouts and dumplings. 

When we left we, felt like we had a few apps and 2 drinks each, for a total bill with tip over $220ca. We certainly were not full and needed to go get some of their food as we left hungry before our show. Candidly the \"street meet we found next was just as tasty and for both of us around $14ca. The ambiance was slightly better at the former though.  

I give two stars because the food was tasty and presented well. Yet service and attitude was pathetic. Will not be returning or recommending."}
{"text":"If there is such a thing as food heaven I reached it when we went to Momofuku last week.

After a disastrous birthday dinner the week before at the restaurant, David Chang called my friend to personally apologize for the way we were treated and invited her and us back to the restaurant to make up for it. 

The 12 of us were treated to every foodie's dream. A dinner cooked by David Chang and his staff. When we first arrived we were served champagne accompanied by tapioca and noiri appetizers. The sommelier picked perfectly matched pairings to accompany each course. For the 2nd course we were served sashimi mackerel, which was one of my favourite dishes of the night.  My next favourite dish was the scrambled eggs with truffles, and black pepper toast. Who knew that something as simple as scrambled eggs and truffles could be so amazing. The eggs were nice and fluffy and the truffles added another depth of flavour. I love truffles and this is the best truffle dish I have ever eaten. This course was paired with a cider. We were also served an Asian mushroom and fried egg noodle salad. The salad had great texture and crunch. Next course was lobster raymen with bok choy. The pieces of lobster were huge. The broth was nice warm and satisfying. Next was the main course fried chicken with caviar, and beef rib eye, this was accompanied by tasty sides: white coffee cauliflower, brussel sprouts, pancakes, kimchi, and potatoes all accompanied with a red wine from Spain. Next course was a shaved foi gras with a Riesling gelay and lychee. It served a nice cleanser for our last course. For our final course we had a decadent chocolate ice cream, and a citrus meringue dessert. Both desserts were nice counterpoints. If you love lemony desserts try this.  For the chocolate lovers out there you will not be disappointed; the chocolate was rich and yummy and the other dessert was light and acidic.  

David came to our table to introduce himself, and the head chef, and his other staff. We were treated with such hospitality and the service was outstanding. It was such an incredible culinary experience. David, his chefs, waitresses and waiters, the manager, sommelier, and everyone at Momofuku went above and beyond what was expected. We were all blown away with the impeccable service and amazing food. I want to thank everyone at Momofuku who made the meal special.  It is something that I will never forget. I am looking forward to other culinary delights coming out of their kitchen."}
{"text":"I went to Daisho about a month ago with a group of 8 and we were hugely underwhelmed by the food, the service, and the value. 

Pros: The restaurant is in a really lovely space. The d√©cor is modern, the view is great, and everything is clean and tidy. 

Cons: 
Service. The maitre d was extremely unhelpful. We asked him what he recommended and he pushed us to order the beef special that night with a $200 price tag to be our main course and he'd provide a bunch of different other menu items as sides. We said we didn't really want one main thing but rather we wanted to sample bits of everything but he continued to say that it was a bad idea and that we needed to order the beef. In the end, it didn't even feel like we had a choice in the matter. While we were impressed with the number of dishes we had, he did not include the one thing we were all looking forward to which was the fried chicken we had heard so much about. Additionally, there seemed to be confusion over who was waiting our table. Three different people asked us for our drink orders even though we had already placed our order with someone else.

Food. We had about 12 different dishes and the best thing I ate was a side cauliflower dish which I think says a lot in and of itself. We had two different pasta dishes served to us and I found them to be adventurous with the ingredients one of which featured octopus, but the execution was mediocre. The burger bun was very disappointing. Having had the delicious pork bun at Momofuku's Noodle Bar downstairs, I had high expectations, but the burger patty itself wasn't good and the combination of a burger bun didn't work at all - neither one complimented the other and I felt it was a big let down. The beef dish was delicious, but it cost $200 and I do not believe that it was worth it at all. 

Price. For 8 people, our bill came out to just over $1,000. I cannot express enough how overpriced the meal was considering what we received. While we all felt full by the end of the meal, the food we ate was far below our expectations and I left feeling completely ripped-off and I can't remember the last time I felt like that about a restaurant.  

All-in-all, the meal was memorable but only because I still can't get over how much we spent on such a mediocre meal. I'm not saying the food was bad, but it wasn't spectacular either and with such a high price tag, the service, food, and overall experience should be excellent and this meal was far from. 

The noodle bar is much better value for what you get, and overall, the food is on par. Do not waste your money on Daisho. Go elsewhere if you want to splurge. Canoe, Bymark, Ki - all far better and all worth the extra money."}
{"text":"I had heard about Mofofuku for years and was not disappointed.  The trout was one of the best dishes I've ever had, and I don't normally even like fish."}
{"text":"Very Average. Quite disappointed. I went here when it first opened and had the same opinion but after watching 'Mind of a Chef' I was reinspired to come back. What are breakfast biscuits doing on the menu at an Asian fusion dinner menu? Tummy filler for sure. The biscuits are good, but not very fitting. The baos are just average - nothing very special. Soy egg...didnt like the mayo. BBQ skate wing was alright - the vegetables on top was good but the skate wing itself was pretty average - you'd be disappointed if you had skate wing in Asia (btw it's not a chicken wing, it's like a stingray type of fish). The sticky rice that came with it quickly hardened up and wasnt great 30 mins after it came out. Spicy spaghetti was probably the best dish that I had."}
{"text":"I don't write longggg reviews very often but I was really upset after visiting this place so I had to write something about it. Bear with me.

Came for a friend's birthday and was expecting alot, I mean its Momofuku Daisho right? We pre-ordered a Bo-saam and man, that was freaking good.....really great pork and we all had generous portions. 

That being said that was the only highlight of the evening. Service was absolutely horrendous!! Wow I have never been talked to so rudely and given attitude like that before from a restaurant of this calibre. 

First a bit of background.... I ordered the hanger steak which was way too over salted. I really couldnt eat this without a lot of rice and some of the lettuce that you were supposed to wrap the steak in. And the plate came with like 2 pieces of lettuce. Fine, so I asked if I could get more lettuce to go with my steak right? Well there happened to be some sitting in a bowl for the Bo-saam which is also to wrap the pork portions in. The server came and when I asked about more lettuce for my beef she rolled her eyes and was like \"Well theres some right in front of your face.\" Whaaa...? I thought it was an honest question but apparently not. Even if I was asking stupidest question, thats not how you treat your customers yes?

So the tiny portions of lettuce was gone in about 2 minutes as the portions of pork were huge and really? We're paying $50+ a head and we can't get a bit more lettuce? We waited about 20 minutes for more lettuce to arrive..... what are they growing it fresh in the back or something? So I asked in a nice polite way about the lettuce and I get an obnoxious toned reply like \"Uh its on its way.....\" 

Oh, almost all the food came and none of the servers had any clue who got what. they just piled a few bowls of noodles on the table and expected us to sort it out. Um we did order individually.. Oh and gf ortdered the ramen... Shame....... it wasn't very good.

When I was almost done my dinner and I was just busy chatting with some of the friends I was with, my server doesn't even ask and takes away my plate! Excuse me... I wasn't finished...?

Thanks, I'll be making the bo-saam at home after this and there would be no reason to visit momofuku again. 2 stars from the awesome bo-saam we had."}
{"text":"Pork belly bun
cookie balls
ramen
cookie

4 stars for the hard seats. my butt hurt.

Wish i had been hungrier to gorge on more food but alas,  only a couple buns for me. The food was good, solid, tasty, fresh. 
But for me the highlight was the cookie balls. i am still thinking about them. So damn. tasty."}
{"text":"Came here for the very first time to check out their summerlicious menu :). I was happy with the selections.

Service: Great! Our waiter was very attentive. Our food came on a reasonable amount of time. 

Decor: Lovely. Very chic and modern. The restaurant was located on the third floor of the building and has a very nice view :). I was impressed. There was also a patio, which was naturally inviting. 

Food: Had the steamed buns with falafel and crispy chicken. My fave was the crispy chicken. For the main entree, I had the Beef Short Rib!!! The beef was nice and tender. The sauce really complimented the beef. I enjoyed it. :) As for the dessert, I got the chocolate custard, cinnamon, and fried dough. The custard was too rich for me. 

Wonderful experience. Must try!"}
{"text":"I came to Daisho on a business dinner last week and had a great experience.  The dining room is absolutely stunning with the full glass windows overlooking the city.  The service was quite good, but not over the top.  We enjoyed a few bottles of a lovely Sancerre - it complemented our meal so nicely.  The food really was the highlight of the evening and we enjoyed it family style - buttermilk biscuits (amazing chili honey on the side), weekly special beef buns, chicken buns (my favorite), cauliflower, nugget potatoes, rice cakes, and ssam.  Definitely a great stop at the Shangri-la hotel!"}
{"text":"I went for their $45 \"5 course\" Summerlicious menu, and was pretty disappointed. This place has had so much hype around it and it was not fulfilled. 2/5 courses were teensy tiny, and I wouldn't have minded if everything tasted good but literally everything we tried was boring (my girlfriend and I ordered different things and shared it all). The only menu item that was pretty good was the Philly bun."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this relatively short and sweet:

Came for the Summerlicious menu and was really pleasantly surprised.
Despite the recent bad reviews of this place, I had a really good experience. We also loved our spot on the terrace, which was a bit quieter than inside.

I got the Chicken karaage bun, grilled trout, and ice cream sandwich. The grilled trout was the best seafood I've had in Toronto so far (coming from a seafood-lovin' Vancouver person). 

The place was super busy but we felt the servers were very attentive and the FOH manager came by to check on us as well. Will be back again someday!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my lunch there earlier this week. Ordered by sharing plates. Food was excellent and the service was pretty good too. A bit pricey however, especially for lunch..."}
{"text":"Tried it out for dinner few months back - took hour to be seated after reservation time 
Once seated - food was good 
Had the beef tongue and fried chicken buns - one or two of each - very unique flavours 
Don't remember the main course 
Dessert was dope too 
The waiters don't dress up here so you aren't sure who's who lol 
Overall decent spot worth checking out"}
{"text":"Went to Momofuku Daisho last night and it was one of the worst meals that I have had in ages.  With such a limited menu, everything on the menu should be perfect and only one of the numerous dishes we tried was adequate.  We started with the pickled vegetables which were bland but even worse, one of the turnips was half mushy, i.e. rotten.  The pretzel bread was fine, but the pork butter that accompanied it tasted very unpleasant (I love pork fat but this was so off).  The chicken wing bun had no distinctive flavor and was utterly boring.  The menu said that the pickerel included jalapenos but again, not a hint of spice with only a few bits of fresh herbs livening up the dish.  The only decent dish was the pork chop - it was moist and flavorful.  But, the worst item was the sweet potato side - the most disgusting and unattractive bowl of food imaginable.  It was messy, way too sweet and the sweet potatoes were undercooked.  Our servers were nice but a bit disengaged, and the courses were served way too quickly.  I was underwhelmed by Ma Peche in NYC and wanted to give Chang another chance.  Wish I hadn't.  The only highlight was the fantastic Twin Peach beer collab between Evil Twin and Bellwoods."}
{"text":"I have had lunch several times at Momofuku Daisho. The modern aesthetics works well with the dynamic views of the floor to ceiling windows. 

It is somewhat a hit and miss. Overall, I would recommend Momofuku Daisho. During the summer, I would recommend sitting on the patio. 

I enjoyed the chicken buns that came with ssam sauce, pickled carrots and scallions. I also enjoyed the grilled chicken sandwich. 

The Roasted Rice Cakes on the other hand was not good. It came with spicy pork sausage, Chinese broccoli and tofu. The ingredients did not go well together. The dish was also heavy."}
{"text":"Daisho is incredibly good. We have gone twice for brunch and were completely impressed both times.

The space is lovely. Fantastic design and lots of natural light. 

They make a biscuit that is easily the best I have ever had. The coffee cured belly bacon is also some of the best bacon I have ever had. 

I am normally not a huge Eggs Benedict fan, and we ordered it with lobster. It was pure heaven. 

We also had some incredible blueberry pancakes. They were perfectly fluffy and delicious. 

Finally the banana bread just happened to be some of the best banana bread I have ever had. You may be noticing a pattern. 

Daisho is not cheap, but it is one of the better establishments our city has to offer."}
{"text":"If you plan on coming here, make reservations because they are always busy! I found the Daisho bar on the 2nd floor pretty decent.

FOOD: they serve a wide variety of unique dishes full of flavour, however some of the dishes are like appetizers so be prepared to order a lot if you're hungry

PRICE: quite expensive for the value of the dishes you are getting

AMBIENCE: nice atmosphere with a decent amount of tables with a good view from the window

Overall, be prepared to spend especially if you plan on going with a large group!"}
{"text":"A couple of girlfriends and I decided to do a casual dinner night and decided to make it up to the 3rd floor at Shangri La. We were seated promptly and soon discovered Winterlicious had begun so naturally what's one going to do - order a la carte or order a 3 course meal for a great price? Seems pretty self explanatory! 

I started with the buns, which were amazing. A bit messy but the crispy chicken bun was sooo nice. My main course was the pork steak. I found the pork tasty and nicely cooked however, there was something mixed in with the dish -- deep fried and a bit too salty. For a dessert I did the apple fritter which were okay. The cream they served it with seemed a bit more yogurt-y, so it came off more on the sour side whereas I would have preferred sweet. 

Overall food was good. Staff was excellent and the restaurant had a nice vibe to it. Despite 3 stars, I wouldn't write this place off."}
{"text":"Mucho-hyped Momofuku has sure opened with a flash and a bang in Toronto.  Expectations being so high for this famous New York eatery as to let the cyinical among us doom it to failure.  I can tell you unequivocally, Momofuku does not disappoint.  

Occupying the sparkling glass box next to the Shangri-la Hotel, and fronted by a spectacular metal sculpture by famed Chinese artist Zhuang Huan, you could easily mistake it for the newest Apple store but there are no iPhones or iPads for sale here only meat, really delicious meat.   Juxtaposed with that magnificent scuplture, the building is all sleek metal, wood and glass.  Lots of clean lines, somewhat austere but never really feeling cold or impersonal.  Probably because its also boisterous and vibrant.  

I managed to book a large format meal on the 3rd floor Daisho.  Faced with a choice of porchetta, short ribs or fried chicken, being the porky, porkers that me and my foodie friends are, opted for the ... PORK!   The meal was supposed to be for 4 to 6 people but the roast that we were presented with could have easily fed twice as many.  Picture this - a full pork loin wrapped with belly and roasted to perfect juicy doneness.  To accompany this slab of tasty beast are some fluffy steamed buns, a trio of savoury mustards and some quick pickles.   We supplanted this feast with sunchokes and a braised eggplant dish just so that we have some kinda veg in there.  There was enough pork to horrify a thousand vegans but can I tell ya - so delicious!!!   The meat was juicy, tender, savoury and sweet all at the same time.  We could only finish one slice each so we each got lots to take home.    Green apple mustard is out of this world as were the sunchokes.  

A word of caution, go on an empty stomach and not having eaten meat for a week.  

A second word of caution - Momofuku has very, very strict rules with time.  Make sure you arrive on time or even a bit early because they have no qualms about keeping tabs on  your late dinner friends.  You are given a full two hour reservation but they do tell you that the meal is timed so that the roast is done right on time.  If you have an early sitting, you kind of get rushed out for the next sitting.  You will feel so stuffed that you are in no mood to move but you are not afforded such luxury.  

Is it worth the hype?  I would say yes with the caveat mentioned above.  The atmosphere is casual and lively, the food is really delicious and place is unpretentious."}
{"text":"Our first stop for Summerlicious 2017 - great ambiance, above average food, polite service.

This was my first time to Momofuku, and upon walking in, I was a wary of how loud the noodle bar was. Fortunately, the noise is out of earshot once you reach Daisho, where you are met with floor-to-ceiling windows and views of Financial District.

Pork belly bao: Presentation could be better (the mayo look slathered onto the bun as an afterthought), but the gloriously juicy pork belly made up for it. I wasn't sure if the slice of tomato did anything to the overall taste, and would have preferred something fresher, like cilantro or pickled carrots. The bun was also fluffy and tender, so no complaints there. However, for getting the most bang for your buck, I would choose Banh Mi Boys over this any day.

Chicken thigh ssam: This was my least favourite dish. You cannot eat this in a elegant way, as you are making your own lettuce wraps here, so I feel like this dish would be more suitable in the appetizer section. I also found that the flavours of this dish to be too much on the sweet and tangy side. 

Strawberry shortcake: I loved the cookies used to sandwich the filling as well as the fresh strawberries in this dish. I thought the strawberry sauce to be too sweet for me, but overall I enjoyed it.

This is a great deal for Summerlicious, but I would be hesitant to visit for their regular menu."}
{"text":"Momofuku noodlebar blew my mind during my last visit in 2013. So much that when I realized I only had a day to spend in toronto with my GF, a momofuku experience was one of the first things I had to share with her. So we made reservations and dined at Daisho.

The second level is much more elegant setting compared to the noodle bar. we were pampered with great service and a great view of Toronto's financial district street.

Now the food: what an experience. When I went to noodle bar I had some expectations of what I was going to try but at Daisho I somewhat had a feeling I'd be trying a ssam course and leaving the rest to what was suggested. Lo and behold the dish I would never expect to blow my mind: The pho beef carpaccio. Fresh local sourced thinly sliced beef dotted with flavour packed \"pho' broth\" gel accompanied by contrasting bites
of rice crackers and these super fragrant and fresh tiny basil leaves.

Next we had a bao crusted with furikake. Just as tasty as their pork and chicken buns but with the added luxury of furikake. I know, it's not much of a sell but when I bit to those wonderful buns, I considered
lying to my gf so I can smother the whole plate.

Of course we had to try the ssam wraps. In fact we tried two. We settled on a chicken dish, accompanied with a creamy mustard sauce and pork, which had a vinegar scallion sauce. The wraps didn't disappoint and they even
hooked us up with extra wraps and rice.

We couldn't do dessert, considering we had a few more place to try that night, but we settled on a visit to the milk bar store. With only Shoto left, I've already started a savings plan so not only to afford this the tasting menu, but to also dress up in the world's most luxurious garb.
I'm talking limo service....tuxes...etc...etc."}
{"text":"Loved Momofuku! The place has a laid back vibe that is welcoming and offers great views. Service was excellent - warm, friendly and informative...not at all pretentious...and the food...

Everything we ordered was excellent. Big portion sizes for a restaurant of this type and packed big flavours. 

Definitely try their buttermilk biscuits, rapini, potatoes and sea bass dishes.

I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"went to Daisho (3rd floor) of Momofuku with my friend for a late dinner.
i've been wanting to try this rest for a while since i've been to the noodle bar on 1st floor for a few times..and finally had a chance to try different things. Normally you would need a reservation but we were lucky to get 2 seats at the bar. The staff  at the reception were really helpful. 

Daisho has a pretty a good wine list so we ordered a white and a red. (wine was a bit pricey- $20 per glass!!)

For appetizer we had pickled cucumber. ( it was quite spicy) 

we also ordered the shrimp bun (it was as good as or even better than the pork bun they serve at noodle bar) and the roasted rice cakes with pork sausage, chinese broccoli and tofu. The texture of rice cakes was good..but i have had similar dish at dim sum place before and was much cheaper :P

For the main, we got the hanger steak served with lettuce, kimchi and onions (exactly like the ginger+onions dipping source for steamed chicken).  you dip the steak into the kimchi and onions source and wrap it with slice of lettuce.... The hanger steak was okay. i would prefer peking duck :)

For the side we ordered tuscan kale with cured ham, sweet onion, maple syrup...woh....that was delicious. The sauce was yummy, and it makes the kale juicy and sweet.. my friend who isn't a big fan of kale said he liked it too. Plus the portion was very generous..

for dessert, we ordered the chocolate with banana, barley in stout (some kind of dark beer). The banana mousse was rich and delicious.

our server (our bartender) was really friendly. The service was pretty fast. The restaurant was very packed...but it has a really good vibe and full of energy (too loud at some point).

From the bar we could look into the other restaurant Shoto on the same floor which was so busy...with patrons come and go.... would love to try that one next time..but that price tag is pretty steep for Shoto..chef menu around $120 per head... 

our bill at Daisho excluding tip and alcohol was over $100. A little pricey but overall it was a nice experience."}
{"text":"Beautiful airy space and nice venue, food is so so.  Have gone a couple of times for lunch and the dishes sound like they will be delicious but, somehow, end up being a little bit off.  Wouldn't go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"I just want to say that Momofuku Daisho has the Saltiest food I've ever had in my life!

I think the day that I went, they dropped ALL the salt they had into ALL the food, or the chefs has NO taste buds. 

I ordered these dishes form the Daisho menu while at the momofuku Nikai floor.
greens and ramps - OMG this was PURE SALT, ALL SALT, had to SPIT it back out, that's how bad it was. I love food, I never do this with food!
rice cakes - PURE SALT as well, I could not taste anything except salt. 
hanger steak - the steak was cut into small slices which was blend and chewy, it came with a few pieces of leaves and some SALTY sauces.

I can NOT believe how bad the food is, I don't mind paying lots for good food, but when the food is THIS bad, I would not even eat it if it was free."}
{"text":"Was here with a friend for the Summerlicious menu. The atmosphere is breathtaking with those huge windows looking out from the Shangri-La hotel complex. The food was deliciously different, and quite unique. The only caveat was that the portions were very small and it felt almost like a tasting menu. My friend decided he needed something else to eat afterwards and ended up getting a crepe down the street."}
{"text":"I had my birthday dinner there last week and I was very impressed. 
I used to live in NYC, and have been to Momofuku noodle bar, milk bar and ssam bar. I have to say that I wasn't so impressed by all 3 restaurants, that's why when my best friend book Daisho for my bday, I was a little hesitant.  
I gave this 4 stars because I enjoyed it so much more than the 3 places I tried in NYC.
Great ambiance, good service, and surprisingly yummy food. The only thing is that I was not a big fan of the dessert that came with our dinner. The black sesame ice cream tasted like there's savory sesame oil in it, which I didn't enjoy (I'm usually a big fan of sweet and savoy combo, but not this one). Also, they didn't have any candles for the birthday girl... 
Overall, I still had a great experience, and would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved dining at this place. Tried everything on the menu. The brussel sprouts, buttermilk biscuits & pakora bun were spot on. The desserts were delicious. Loved Loved loved everything about this place. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I didn't review this place right away. Went there in the winter and had the worst dining experience ever. The place was cold, and my husband and I got sick from eating their food (him more than me). We did get our money back so we are thankful to them for that but the food was not even worth the price and I will never go back here. Overpriced \"ok\" food with pretentious waitstaff. I'd rather go to Guu Izakaya or Oja at Yonge/Bloor. I was very disappointed with this place especially wanting to go there for so long."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite dining experiences bar none.  With creative menu options and seasonal changes, this menu leaves you wanting for nothing. The flavour combinations are bordering on magical. Ive been in a party of 2 and ordered multiple small dishes and as a larger party ordering family style platters, both were exceptional. 

I wish i had one dish i could rave about, but they have all been superb."}
{"text":"Delicious food, posh atmosphere-  would like a few more gluten free options for guests though.

Exemplary service!"}
{"text":"I wasn't stoked on being socially persuaded to come here, but I'll admit that I was pleasantly surprised with the experience, even if it may have been caused from my original skepticism.

Without going over everything, I'll simply recommend a few noteables:
-Pork Belly was a wonderful mix of fatty bits and crunchy edges and menu titled \"sexy scallions\". While I can't vouch for the sexiness of the scallions, it was my favourite dish.
-Brussel sprouts may be some of the best I've ever had. While $15 for a side of vegetables may seem excessive, I will say it was a good sized plate which is very shareable among big groups.

On the flip I'll also say that despite the hype, I really wasn't impressed with the Rice Cakes.


Service was alright, friendly but a bit overbearing with upselling attempts (no, we don't need two of everything, but thanks).

Overall it's a safe 3 stars with the caveat of knowing it won't be a cheap meal, but I'm actually more curious to see what happens when Daisho closes later this year and opens under a new Momofuku concept as planned."}
{"text":"I was very much looking forward to visiting one of the most stunning looking restaurants in Toronto. I had driven by the restaurant weekly and heard the exciting buzz around the food they serve. Finally, my wife and I decided to take the plunge and made a reservation for have their Valentine's Day special menu. 

The first impression of the restaurant was very positive. We got seated next to a window and the view was great. It didn't take longer than few seconds to notice that it was extremely cold next to the window. When we told the staff about it, they offered to bring hot water...! One of the staff members wore a parka, joking that she needs it because it's so cold and it all is really ShangriLa hotel's fault. We didn't find that kind of joking particularly funny. The fact that it was so cold made the whole experience very unpleasant and in the end we were just rushing to leave. Also, the service was unusually slow.

The food was fairly good, but the problem is that it should be excellent at this price point. Nothing about the food we ate impressed us and a lot of it tasted like basic Asian comfort food. You can get much better similar food at Guu for less than half the price.

When we made our reservation on-line there was an entry field that asked if this was a special occasion - in our case it was our 5th anniversary. This was not acknowledged at any point in any way which left me wondering what is the point of asking it in the first place.

Few hours after eating, I was throwing up. I wouldn't go back to this restaurant even for a free meal. I feel completely ripped off."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Feb 14, 2014.  It was a special menu for VD.  Food was excellent.  Service was excellent.  Not much else to say. I will go back and will recommend it to friends and family."}
{"text":"Delicious. Simply one of my favorite restaurants in Toronto. I have been already 3 times. For some reason it reminds me of Nobu, which is a good thing to be reminded of."}
{"text":"Eating at Momofuku Daisho is not a meal, it's an experience.

Friends of mine set up a dinner date for 7 at this restaurant. We ordered the Bo 'ssam dinner for the table, then settled on a few of the other dishes for the sides. Everything was magnificent. I can still taste the meaty, fatty, pork butt melting on my tongue.

Our group was going all in for a luxurious experience, so we ordered cocktails. To my honest surprise, every single cocktail was delicious. Not one side dish was less than excellent, and we all had a feast to remember.

When you're spending the kind of money we were spending, you expect amazing service - we had amazing service. At the end of a ridiculously fabulous dinner, the restaurant offered us a digestif on the house, which made us feel appreciated. 

I would not recommend this for people with small children, or who prefer chain restaurants, but if you want an *experience* from beginning to end, honestly Momofuku Daisho was worth every penny."}
{"text":"We had the Bo Ss√§m and it was perfect - the pork was melt in your mouth good, oysters were delicious, kimchi was great, and the fact that we were all putting food into lettuce wraps and eating with our hands made this whole experience at Daish? an amazing one. For dessert, I had the vanilla ice cream - loved the minimalist presentation with the vanilla pods underneath it. If you're with a large group, definitely order the bo ss√§m - it was super fun eating with the lettuce wraps and we left feeling super full."}
{"text":"Winterlicious 2015:
Squash soup 13
Roasted haddok saam 22
Date pudding 10
Winterlicious 3 course price: $28

Soup:
Presented with  a plate with cilantro, yogurt, dried fruit and poured the soup from a small canter.
Creamy squash savory curry. Nice crunchy sweet banana added texture

Haddock:
Salad wrap format. Came with lettuce, fish and three sides one coleslaw, oil/scallion/ginger, and wasabi mayo. I put a little of everything on a lettuce wrap. Creamy overall and nice accents of ginger and wasabi.

Date pudding:
A cake with butterscotch sauce, walnut sprinkles and I think... thin rice cracker sprinkles. A spoon of rich sweetness in every bite. Very conventional.

Portion wise, I wasn't too full but for the amount, I wish there was more. The service was prompt although compared to the other table, I didn't get an explanation of the dishes. The capacity of the restaurant was surprisingly small. Not surprised if it gets fully booked. Many customers ordered the expensive items."}
{"text":"One of my friends and I came here on a whim since we frequented the Momofuku Noodle Bar and was curious to dine in the lush ambience of Daisho. Even though the view was scarce from the third floor, it was still nice to see the outside through the top-down glass windows. The finishing of the place was extremely clean and it somehow reminded me of an upscale ikea (weird right?) Because we didn't have any reservations, we were snuck into a table with a time limit of 2 hours, which was plenty enough! An appetizer of pickled cucumbers with chilli peppers was brought to us shortly before our waiter gave us a thorough run-down of the menu. In addition, we got to sample a drink from the friendly bartender. In the end, we ended up ordering 2 dishes:

Roasted Rice Cake (spicy pork sausage, chinese broccoli, tofu) - nice and spicy. it is reminiscent of the korean dish. the bottom of each rice cake is crispy. Delicious
Duck buns (with pickled turnips and date hoisin sauce) - the duck was amazing. everything tasted like i could get it from Banh Mi Boys though 

Overall, I like the concept of sharing the dishes ie. everything is chopped up to bite-sized pieces so you can focus more on the taste and texture of the food."}
{"text":"Loved the beef brisket large format dinner! The meal was served family style and must be reserved in advance. Came here with a group of 7 but the portions were so ginormous it could easily have fed 10 people. The beef brisket which initially looked like uninspiring giant chunks of meat turned out to be so tender and juicy! It's crusted with a dry rub and slowed cooked to delicious perfection. I also couldn't get enough of the fluffy white steamed buns that came with brisket - you can wrap it around the meat and add papaya slaw and crab mayo #yum... We all stuffed ourselves but still had so much left over to bring home - I don't think we even managed to make it halfway through..

Besides the satisfying food coma it is also a bit pricey - $290 for the large format style. So probably only good for a large group of hungry meat-lovers."}
{"text":"There are three different Momofuku owned restaurants I believe at this address. We were on the third floor upscale one with a great view through the floor to ceiling glass walls. My son is a foodie and wanted to go here as we were visiting Toronto. 

The meal was beyond excellent in every way. But what really made it great, was our server, Jeff. He took the time to discuss the food and our choices. He personalized our dining experience. Thank you Jeff."}
{"text":"Summerlicious 2017
Tomato salad  : loved it
Roasted Trout : crispy skin but medium rare and super moist inside! Quite savory with the light butter sauce
Strawberry shortcake : a lil too sweet, not your typical sponge cake, it was more like two cookies sandwiching some yogurt 
Music : a lil loud and upbeat, hope they tune down the volume a bit :3 
Service ??: great service! 
Overall def worth a try!"}
{"text":"Such a great place that has such a wonderful vibe! The food is fresh and so very delicious! The staff is attentive and friendly. I had the pork ramen that was above and beyond your normal bowl of ramen. The menu is simple and streamlined and in my opinion is a good thing because the choices they have to offer are perfect for anyone looking for the right amount of variety while not being overwhelmed by too many choices! When I'm back in TO I will come back."}
{"text":"One of the better restaurants in Toronto. Probably in my top 3 in Toronto. Make sure to do a reservation before coming. 

The crispy chicken buns are fantastic and a must for the appetizers. The oysters are always changing but the cucumber and kimchi sauce that they use with it is delicious. The roasted mushroom salad was delicious as well and contained a lot of different types of mushrooms.

The star of the meal was the whole trout. This is a must if you have never been here. Even if you hate fish, you will love the trout here. It was probably one of the best pieces of fish I have ever eaten. The entire fish was already de-boned and you just had to remove the head and tail which was very easily done. The flesh was extremely soft and with the sauce, the perfect combination. 

I usually don't like corn but the sweet corn was highly recommended by our server so I had to give it a shot. I was not let down. 

By the time the dessert menu had come, we were full. Not overstuffed but full. However, the desserts looked so good that my girlfriend and I actually ordered 3 desserts. The donuts were ok. It didn't compare with the rest of the meal. However, the apple crumble was a hit as well as the peach cobbler."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 6 for a birthday. Service is great although being a new restaurant, there are still some kinks that needs to be ironed i.e. coat hangers etc. The duck egg is awesome and so is the  apple soup. We had chicken as mains (needs 48 hours notice to order) and it was good but  I've had better tasting chicken elsewhere. For dessert, we had pear trifle paired with black sesame ice cream and it was out of this world!

overall, great service, great location, great ambiance and good food."}
{"text":"NO HEAT... that really says it all. We waited for our date after reserving, made our chicken pre-order, agreed to all the obnoxious rules (leave a credit card, it will be charged $100 if don't show, table will be given away if you are late, etc). We even got email reminders from them about the rules leading up to it. 

On the night of, we were seated at a nice table by the window, but quickly realized how cold it was in the room. GROWN MEN WERE WEARING COATS AND TUQUES.  

When this was mentioned to the server as we took off our coats and got seated, he said, \"yeah, we're having heating problems\".  We FROZE through our dinner - two of us had to get our coats from the hostess. They don;t seem to have an actual coat check. 

The food was good, but not exceptional. $125 for a plate of really good chicken, but it got clammy and cold in a minute.  The sides were fun, sometimes awkward, like the pcikled veg in a tiny jar that were impossible to dislodge. They don't have tea, not any tea. Coffee was good - in a bodum. Milk, no cream.  Two choices of desserts - we tried them both. Nothing special.

At some point a guy came over and asked how's everything - we told him we were freezing and having trouble enjoying the meal.  \"Steven\" acted basically indifferent -he said sorry as he looked in another direction, then walked away. Zero tact for someone who's managing the joint.  

It turns out they comped our  wine and beer.  No one said anything - it was just missing from the bill.  The bill was still hundreds. If it were my place, I would have emailed patrons in advance and let them know about the issue. 
...Or rented portable heaters. 
...Or give people the option upon arrival whether they would like to return on a different night. 
...Or invite us to come bcak for a comp meal another night.  

This was a completely crappy experience.  The final injury was exiting through the noodle bar downstairs where people were slurping away their $15 ramen bowls WITH THE HEAT ON."}
{"text":"South of the 49th Parallel, Korean-American chef and entrepreneur David Chang founded Momofuku Noodle Bar, Momofuku Ss√§m Bar, M√° P√™che, Milk Bar and Momofuku Ko in New York City. North of the boarder is the Great White North Toronto Financial District where David Chang's expanded Momofuku Noodle Bar TO, Nikai, Daish? and Sh?t?. Towards the Indian Ocean is Momofuku Sei?bo in Sydney, Australia. I digress.

We fell more in love with David Chang after watching The Mind of a Chef produced by Anthony Bourdain.

Of course you can find the various Momofuku specialties stacked in one building at 190 University Ave right next to Shangri-La Hotel Toronto.

What do you order for big group parties at Momofuku?
One of the specialties of Momofuku is their Bo Ssam. Essentially, this is no small task for one person. Which is why it is perfect for large group dinners. Momofuku Daisho features large format meals that are served family-style. Reservations are required and Daisho offers mulitple large format meals for parties of 4-10 people.
I'm still amazed at the notion some hold 'sharing' food with such a shock value. Family style / sit-down meals, where dishes of food are placed center of table in large portions from which diners serve themselves are customary at home. It seems once we 'go out to eat', this becomes a big deal.

Bo Ssam is Korean for wrapped. It includes a whole slow roasted 6-8 hours pork butt with a brown sugar and kosher salt rub, a dozen oysters, white rice, bibb lettuce, ss√§m sauce (korean bbq sauce), kimchi and ginger scallion sauce.
You are encouraged to make wraps with the pork and condiments or eat as they please.

$240 for your entire party (6-10 people), not including additional food and drinks ordered, tax and tip.

Chicken Buns 6 each: Fried chicken with pickled turnip, date hoisin, scallion wrapped in an open faced big bun. Nothing special and over-hyped. The infamous pork buns are not available on the 3rd floor Momofuku Daisho. Can not be brought up from the first floor Momofuku Noodle Bar because they are 'two seperate restaurants operating in the same building'. If you must insists on enjoying your pork buns made with hoisin, scallion and cucumber, you can order take out and physically walk it upstairs to your seat! Seems awfully a lot of trouble for just one dai bao we can do without!

Fluke Sashimi 14: Marinated in citrus oil with a wash of buttermilk, yuzu and Sirracha. The fish was much too fishy. If would not order this again. Really so not worth the calories!!
 
Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Fish Sauce Vinaigrette. This is a side plate added on to the Bo Ssam. Tasty and something I would love to make at home.
 
Momofuku Milk Bar Milk Store in on the second floor off from Nikai cocktail lounge and closes at 11pm. This little section 'grocery' store fits no more than six people. What to buy from the Milk Store?

Crack Pie is available in single servings for $6 or $48 for a whole pie. Unlike Milk Bar in NYC, these are flew in and stocked. The sugar pie is super sweet with a crumbly crust steeped in syrup.

Cookies! Plastic wrapped cookies at $2 each or $11 for six. Best sellers are compost cookie packed with graham crackers, butterscotch and chocolate chips, potato chips, pretzels and coffee ground. I actually prefer the cornflake marshmallow maple-pecan-coconut cookie. I like the soft chewiness of the marshmallow. Also available are blueberry & cream, peanut butter, and corn.

Momofuku Milk Bar is the bakery dessert pioneered by Christina Tosi and David Chang. Two of my favorite recipe books are Milk Bar Life: Recipes & Stories and the classic Momofuku Milk Bar. You can also make cereal milk cupcakes!
Speaking of cereal milk, you must try the cereal milk soft served ice cream! Slightly salty and loads of sweet. Crunchy cereal corn flakes are sprinkled on top and settled on the bottom.

Now I can say that I've been to Momofuku. I feel that not everything blew our minds or was a delicious as anticipated. I do blame it on the hype. Just like the hype that brings countless patrons requesting for the pork bun on the third floor only to find that it is only available at the noodle bar."}
{"text":"I was excited to come here after hearing so many good things about it and when walking on University, seeing it tower before me. Unfortunately, it was just a tower of disappointment.

I went for summerlicious lunch with a friend a couple days ago. The hostess was friendly as well as the servers. They described the dishes in excellent detail which I really appreciate! I like to be reminded what I ordered so I can taste it during my dish.

Karaage Bun& Radish Salad:

We got the Karaage Bun and the Radish Salad. The bun actually looked like something you can just get at Banh Mi Boys so I wasn't exactly too impressed with that .. and the radish salad was presented beautifully. However, the taste was all salt and vinegar and i just seemed like the veggies popped out from a pickled jar. 3/5; but mainly for the presentation and the servers.

Mussels & Beef Ribs:

Small portions. But it wasn't even presented that nicely. The mussels were tiny. it would of been better to give bigger mussels and a smaller amount of them, then to give lots of mussels but candy sized pieces of meat. The soupy/sauce was nice, but nothing too spectacular.
The beef ribs were quite nice; paired with a salad and rice with peanuts on top. Honestly, this looked like you can get it at any Vietnamese restaurant. It even tasted like it too .. I was extremely unimpressed with this dish as it was not at all original and the plating; although looked nice, just seemed unoriginal as well. 2/5 for both main dishes. Sorry.

Strawberry & Corn:

Sadly, I think the desserts were the best out of the entire meal. The strewberries were delicious paied with the cream and soft shortcake. It was definitely sugary, but not too sweet. It was perfect. The corn dessert was like a fat kid's carnival snack dream com true. Custard, caramel popcorn, and butterscotch. It was sweet and even a little bit savory. Really nice; but didn't exactly blow my mind. 4/5.

Overall, it was good. But I wouldn't come here again. The view was nice though. ^.^;"}
{"text":"Maybe it's just us, but we thought the food was just OK. The waiter insisted on their chicken bun instead of their featured pork bun... what a mistake! On that note we actually like the buns downstairs better. Most of what we ordered was just OK. Amazingly enough my favorite was this rice cake dish, simple, tasty, and just crunchy and savory enough. Probably won't come back. I would definitely try the noodle shop downstairs again though"}
{"text":"Everything is tasty and prepared well. Servers were attentive to our allergies and informed our party if any dish had ingredients that we had allergies to.  Cutlery and plates were changed once which I did not feel I needed.
For the price it did not necessarily feel it was worth it but definitely delicious"}
{"text":"I originally provided this feedback to the restaurant privately over a month ago. But after not hearing anything back from them (not even an acknowledgement) I'm sharing this publicly:

A dinner at a restaurant should be an experience. You pay not just for the food but for the service, time to dine, and ability to enjoy oneself with good friends and family.

I don't believe that we got this whole package tonight at Daish?.

First and foremost I want to say that this is not a reflection of the wait staff. As far as I'm concerned, the servers were very knowledgable and attentive! 
My main gripe was the fact that the whole meal seemed very rushed. The food came out way too quickly and one after the other. We ended up having all our dishes on the table very shortly after being seated. Whilst this may be ideal at a lunch service or a fast food restaurant this is not conducive to an exceptional dining experience.
So much so, that we were out of the restaurant within an hour of being seated!
I don't know if this is done on purpose in order to turn tables over quicker, but I certainly did not expect this from Daish?."}
{"text":"5 star for ambiance and service. About a 3.5 for food. Definitely a date night place, especially if you want to nosh but not load up on food before, say, the symphony. Not sure why this place is \"kinda\" Japanese but most of the dishes seem to be Korean inspired. Kimchi is everywhere on the menu. As well, you'll find dukbokki on the menu but called \"rice cakes\". I'd give a pass to the buttermilk biscuits but of course try the crispy chicken buns. The duck and pork sausage was amazing."}
{"text":"Yes. Yes. Yes. Do the yes dance everyone. I have dreamt about this meal for 9 days. My co-worker and I came here for a little celebration lunch. I got the crispy skate wing and she got the pork shoulder steak. We also started with the buttermilk biscuits. Everything, and I mean everything, was perfect. I would gladly spend $50pp for the meal again."}
{"text":"We have been dying to try the much-talked about Momofuku Daisho, and decided give it a try. We ended up coming home and having another dinner after spending $450 for 6 people and leaving less than satisfied. The d√©cor I know is supposed to be minimalist, however, it was just cheap and the music gave us all a headache. The best thing was the bun....everything else went downhill. We are foodies and love good food...save your hard earned money and go to 2 other venues instead of this one...you will be more satisfied, and your palate will thank you (so will your pocketbook)!"}
{"text":"Went for Mother's Day prix fixe meal. Starters were ok, nothing very special. Main dish meat was good but came with 2 small sides that was served to share for the whole table. Would of been nice to have more veggies to eat with the main. 
For dessert, the apple pie crust was so tough we had trouble cutting it with a steak knife and it was served at room temperature. Was expecting more from this restaurant, especially for something simple like apple pie. 

The restaurant itself was nice with a good view. Service was also good. Just wish the food was better!"}
{"text":"Came here for a corporate dinner.
To summarize: the food is ok, some items are fine but others are just too salty. Service is great and attentive. Location is good for corporate events; even better if it's accessible under the PATH. 

There were a total of 10 dishes including dessert. All are sharable.
Squash salad: tastes pretty good and flavorful.
Eggplant bun: the eggplant is deep fried topped with red peppers and cheese, almost tastes like steak.
Spicy Rice cake: with some minced meat/sausage. You can tell that the rice cake is pan fried so it's crunchy on the outside and soft on inside. 
Whole Trout: this is pretty good too Cuz it's not too salty. The fish is deep fried with veggies.
Pork chop: not too bad as it's still moist but nothing special.
Muscovy duck: this is the best. So tender, just righty amount of seasoning, the skin is light and crispy like those Peking duck.
Brussels sprouts with fish sauce: this is the worst. The Brussels sprouts are burnt and all soaked with sauce.... So salty that you can't even tell it's fish sauce. The only thing I couldn't finish.
Nugget potato: tastes ok, not memorable. Also on the salty side.
Chocolate frozen mousse: it comes with some milky/eggy jello stuff which is tasteless but the frozen mousse is pretty good, almost like icecream shattered in pieces. 
There should be one more dish but I couldn't recall. 

Overall it's a pretty decent experience."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Came for Summerlicious - generous portions. The crispy chicken bao was unbelievably good as was the chocolate mousse dessert. I really enjoyed how the chef served samples of other menu items to the guests. The pea soup sample was amazing.

The only thing that could of been improved would be the service. It wasn't horrid or anything they just forgot our drinks at some point but I think it was just the server being busy. Also, it is a little pricey.

Overall probably one of my favourite restaurants and I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Niagara Falls and Toronto for our honeymoon.  We were so excited to try Momofuku Daisho that it was the first place we dined at when we made it to Toronto.  However, we had never been more disappointed with a restaurant before!

First, what we liked about the restaurant: Its location was perfect as well as how it was designed.  Momofuku Daisho is on the second floor of a building that is all windows, giving you a beautiful view of the street below it.  The design is modern but casual outfitted with expensive looking picnic tables and the coolest light fixtures I had ever seen.  The restaurant is impressive.  I only wished the food was as impressive as the space.

When our server came, my husband mentioned to him that I was gluten-free and he was told when he made the reservation that our server could tell us what I could order. This is when our server decided to hate me.  He rolled his eyes and told me that if I couldn't \"make myself\" eat gluten, my menu options would be very limited.  It was how he said it that was so off putting - like I had a choice in my health.  He was right, however.  There was only four things on the menu that didn't contain gluten: a pork dish, fish dish, radishes, and cauliflower side.  I therefore decided to try the cauliflower side with pok pok tamarind, peanut, and apple and the secreto with xo sauce, clams, and bibb lettuce.  My husband went with the burger bun with onion, cheddar, and special sauce as an appetizer and the hanger steak lettuce wraps with kimchi, onions, and bibb lettuce.

While the burger bun was very original, my husband was not impressed.  Other than the bun looking different than a typical hamburger bun, the taste of the hamburger reminded him of a Mc Donald's hamburger.  The hanger steak lettuche wraps were also good, but nothing special and definitely not worth the price.

My order of secreto was disgusting.  I took one bite and that was all I could muster.  The pork seemed to have zero seasoning and was brined/cooked in such a way that it almost seemed gummy like when you were chewing it.  It really had an odd texture that was not pleasant.

The one item that my husband and I did like was the cauliflower. It was cooked so that the cauliflower was slightly carmelized.  The peanuts and dried apple in the dish also brought a delicious flavor to the dish.

All in all, we were very disappointed in our meal, and we would not recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Toronto, especially since there are so many fantastic restaurants in the city.  However, we would recommend that they grab one drink at the bar so they can enjoy the beauty of the restaurant itself.  I just wish that such a beautiful restaurant could serve of equal quality food."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant. It's beautifully designed although louder than you'd expect. Great wine selection. Our waiter was extremely helpful in recommending dishes and putting together portions that fit our table - like three buns instead of two. The food was phenomenal. I don't get the poor reviews below but to be fair I can't comment on consistency having been there only once. What did we eat:
- kim chi: excellent, spicy, crisp
- fish buns: amazing. Light crunch and perfectly cooked. This is the response to a fish fillet at mcdonalds - old bay and tartar
- roasted rice cakes: the sausage is excellent and the crunch of the rice cakes is perfect
- buckwheat noodle: warm - tasty yellow foot mushrooms and nice soup 
- brussel spouts: highly crispy and addictive
- charred cabbage: mustardy and crispy - soo good
- hanger steak: super tender and buttery - fresh lettuce and sauce
- chicken thigh: really really juicy and tender

I will definitely come back here to try out other buns - - apparently they have had cheeseburger buns and buffalo wing buns. Coming from Brooklyn I'm familiar with chef Changs awesomeness. Daisho I'm jealous"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch, we ordered Egg Benedict and Fried Chicken. Both of which were the best I've ever had! 

The fried chicken were crispy coated with the just right amount of sweet honey taste and not too spicy chili flakes. The dish portion is enough to feed a 6-ft guy :p so definitely worth to give it a try. The lady (who seemed to be real passionate about food) beside our table strongly recommended this dish while we were looking through the menu :) Good recommendation!

Egg Benedict is something I would always choose for brunch, and since momfuku has it on its brunch menu :)  It's close to perfect, from the sauce to the egg. The poached egg is soft from inside out, with creamy-runny yolk flow out after cut open from the center. The hollandaise sause is perfectly mixed as well, (at least suits my taste 100% since I have quite sensitive taste buds, even a bit salty will ruin the dish for me), I wonder if it is made in-house?

The only thing might be the bread? That I found in most egg benedicts, that it is actually hard to cut it with the egg on top and still look presentable, often, it will create a mess by trying.. which I did..

Overall, definitely I will go back again, to try the other mains :)"}
{"text":"Tried Momofuku Daisho as part of Winterlicious on Jan 31. Chaotic experience from the arrival. We entered through the Noodle Bar on the ground floor, where there were 3 staff around the entrance way. None of them acknowledged us and stood around chatting, even though the restaurant was packed. We told them we had reservations for Daisho but we were about 20 minutes early. One of them grunted that it was on the 3rd floor and went back to gossiping. We went up to the 2nd floor first to see if we could get a drink at the bar. Sat at the bar for a few minutes before a staff member rudely advised us it was closed. Unimpressed.

We went for a walk around the block to calm down, and returned at 8 p.m. to Daisho. We were seated pretty quickly upstairs. The first staff took my coat, then 2 other staff came to see if I needed assistance with a coat. It was weird since I was standing around bare armed in January.

Shared table - did not enjoy sharing our table with another couple. I felt like I was intruding on their date, and they were in the way of ours.

Ordering confusion - there was a price on the top of the menu for winterlicious, then each entree and appetizer was broken out with pricing underneath it. Added up the prices and it would have been cheaper to order a la carte than the winterlicious menu - not logical. 

We got the steamed buns - 2 vegetarian ones for me, one pork & one vegetarian one for my companion. Taste was fine.

Waiter tried to rush our bottle of wine to us when I still had half a beer, was very strange. Was also pushy on getting dessert on the table when we still had a quarter of a glass of wine. Please, let me enjoy my marked up wine before you add the next course.

Partner had the beef cheek, I had the trout. Both were fine in terms of presentation and serving temperature. Nothing to brag about.

Both of us had banana chocolate mousse for dessert. Overly sweet.

Today I cannot keep anything in besides clear liquid, not pleased.

Overpriced for what you are getting. We went cause of the hype of the name, and we were put off by inattentive service and high prices. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Since our last amazing experience with the work team dinner, we were meaning to go back as a family. We were staying over at Shangri La to celebrate the wife's birthday weekend and had a reservation for dinner. With a 21 month old toddler, we knew it was going to be challenging but didn't expect the night to start with the little guy breaking a plate and making a bit of a scene. We were embarrassed as parents, but the staff, including Jeff went out of their way to accommodate us and make us feel comfortable. Treated us to a chef special (not on the menu) and took care of our appetizers. The staff really turned around a night we thought would turn out to be nightmare into a night to remember and cherish. Thank you Daisho Team! We will be coming back again and will wholeheartedly recommend Momofuku Daisho! One of the best staff we have ever encountered at any restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great food. However it would of been nice to be told that there was no heat in the place. Froze my ass off.  However got a free tea as compensation."}
{"text":"My relatives from trendy west coast were over in Toronto and ended up bringing them to Daisho. This is a retro- post from October, so the menu is a little different now, but we are also able to look back and think about what was or was not so memorable about the dinner.

This is a 4 star rating primarily due to the fantastic service, food knowledge of the staff, and ambiance of the place. Beautiful view of Toronto through the floor to ceiling windows surrounding the dining area. 

Food rating is closer to a 3.5. The mushroom dish was perfection. The hanger steak saam was really tasty - that steak was cooked and seasoned beautifully. The chicken saam and variety of baos we tried were alright - not incredibly memorable. The eggplant Bao resembled an eggplant parmesian - which didn't give us enough of that kick of fusion. 

Good food and great atmosphere if you're looking for a relaxing place to catch up family style."}
{"text":"Came with a coworker and we thought they were going to be small plates.  They are not small.  We ordered way too much for 2 people, but luckily that means more to review.

Nothing we ordered came out looking anything like what we thought it might.  We had no idea what many of the ingredients were, but our waiter was pretty knowledgeable.

Sunchoke - really the standout plate of the meal.  Clay pepper is apparently something that grows in abandoned train stations in Montreal?  I thought it would be like a peppercorn.  Regardless, it was a great dish.

Brussel sprouts - I liked it, but it's very intensely flavored by the fish sauce, which my coworker didn't care for.  The sprouts themselves are shredded rather than halved.

Hato Mugi - this presentation of bone marrow was interesting.  It was on top of some sort of barley and really was a very filling dish due to the richness of the marrow and the abundance of grain.  I wouldn't order this again.  

Rice Cakes - so I couldn't decide if this or the Sunchoke were my favorite dish.  I could probably just come here for this.

Chicken - the chicken was dark meat wrapped in white meat wrapped in skin and then fried.  Presentation wise this got an A+, flavor wise it really was lacking.  I'm not sure if it's because the other dishes were so intensely flavored, but the chicken was definitely bland.  The meat was cooked perfectly, but there just wasn't any flavor.  Disappointing.

Chocolate - 5 textures.  I'm not a huge dessert person, but this was so good that I made room in my overfull stomach.

I'm not sure if this is a Toronto thing, but our server kept disappearing.  He'd bring out a dish, but then not reappear until the next dish was served.  That was fine, but after he brought all the dishes, he didn't appear again until we flagged down another girl walking by.  

We asked her if we could order dessert and she said, \"well the kitchen closes at 11pm.\"  Um okay, but it's 10:55pm, we've been sitting here for 10 minutes while various people have been cleaning up the tables around us and no one has checked on us.  Luckily, we were able to get our order in.  I think that was my coworker's favorite of the evening."}
{"text":"After being mildly unimpressed by their noodle bar, thought I'd come back to Daisho to give Momofuku another try.

Summerlicious menu - their app - their baos won me hands down.  I could eat 10 of their crispy chicken buns and 5 of their falafel buns.  Chicken was panfried with a really flavourful seasoning and the buns were soft.  They're just good.  The sweet corn salad also had pastrami pieces that I really liked, and being a fan of corn I'd recommend that app as well.

I was somewhat let down by the main, beef short rib with charred pepper, walnut, spinach.  The sauce didn't add a whole lot to the dish and the star of the dish ended up being the rice and walnuts for me.  I think the short ribs were cooked nicely, the problem was the mediocrity of the sauce. 

The dessert was what bumped my original 3.5 stars down to a 3... the chocolate custard/fried dough was way too chocolatey - the dough was just fried, hard pieces of oil which didn't help balance the chocolate.  The portion was also not done right for fine dining imo, it was served in a bowl and way too much.  I had 2 bites and could not finish.  The berries shortcake was more delicious but could've also have used more thought in plating (i.e. not be served in a bowl)"}
{"text":"My new fav restaurant, by far!!!!  It's hard to remember a time where I enjoyed a meal so much. From my cocktail (the bar U) to the desert and everything in between.  It was flavourful, beautifully simple yet complex in flavour.  Most of all, IT WAS FUN!"}
{"text":"Came to Momofuku in a party of 7 with plans to go to the noodle bar. At 5:30pm there was already a line forming, but the host told us Daisho just opened on the 3rd floor, sweet! We went there instead and were not disappointed. The space itself is beautiful with high ceilings and a great view of the city. The decor is similar to other momofukus - minimalist and simple. As with the noodle bar, there is no where to hang your coat... Our server said, \"I guess this is one of those don't-bring-a-lot-of-stuff places\". Okay... good luck in the winter! There are some communal tables as well as smaller ones for groups of 4 or less. 

The menu is designed for sharing, so it's good to come here in a group. While we looked at the menu, they brought out some chopped cucumber in a spicy vinegar-y dressing. Refreshing. There is an a la carte menu as well as menu items that are designed for larger groups (referred to as \"large format\" dining on their website). You are supposed to call and order ahead, but since today was the opening day, they had some of those options available. We decided to have the fried chicken, which easily could have served 9-10 people even though it says it's for 4-6 ($125). It was served on a platter, family-style with some garlic and ginger dipping sauces, scallion pancakes, radishes, lettuce, and tabasco salt. A LOT of food! The chicken was so juicy and the skin was crispy, with a nice spiciness, without being too salty. We also ordered some steamed buns as appetizers. They were not the famous pork belly buns, but had Canadian peameal bacon in them with some sweet mustard. We looked at the other tables who ordered the family-style platters -- there is a bo ssam (whole pork butt), beef short rib, and beef ribeye. The portions were also huge! For dessert, we had another sharing item - the pear trifle. Frangipane, bourbon, crispy black sesame + black sesame ice cream. Interesting mix of flavours and a nice way to end the meal. Drink options include cocktails, wine, beer, and sake + some non-alcoholic drinks (mocktails hehe!). The cocktails were expensive, $16-20. I had one with gin, kasu, lychee, sparking water. It was smooth and potent, not too sweet. 

Service was attentive - our server was able to answer any questions we had (like why are there random numbers next to items on the menu?) and kept our waters filled. Oh and one of the servers has a hello kitty tattoo! So cute! The ambiance is nice - it's a fine dining kind of place without feeling stuffy; you could show up here in jeans or a suit and be equally comfortable. It gets noisy, but you're still able to have a conversation since the music is kept at a reasonable volume. Our meal came to $60 per person including tax, tips, drinks, which was less than I expected. Momofuku Daisho is definitely a great addition to the Toronto restaurant scene! I look forward to coming back and seeing how the menu changes."}
{"text":"Disappointing more than anything else. The location, decor and atmosphere are great and the service was good, but the food was mediocre at best. We had the pork belly and kimchi starters which were good, but when it came to the mains, the skate wing was dry and stringy and the pork chop which we waited 45 mins for was undercooked and 50% fat.
Maybe the other menu options are better, but with so many other options, I won't be going back to find out."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised. Came for a birthday dinner and will definitely be back.

The wait staff were friendly and helpful, guided us perfectly through the menu. They ensured we ordered the appropriate amount for sharing and variety.

It was our first time, so we ordered what are considered the staples.
- duck buns, Brussels sprouts, squash salad (my favourite dish), roasted rice cakes and hanger steak ssam

Drinks were delicious as well"}
{"text":"I'm pretty disappointed with my latest experience at Momofuku Daisho. 

My expectations were really high as the Noodle Bar and Milk Bar are so amazing!

We visited this past weekend to enjoy the Lunch Summerlicious menu. We both ordered a BBQ pork steam bun to start and they were just as good as when we've enjoyed them at the Noodle Bar. Strangely though, they only brought them out on one plate. I'm not sure if they expected us to bounce the plate back and fourth as I had to ask someone for a second plate to eat mine.

For our mains, I ordered the pork lettuce wrap thingamabobber and my fiance had the salmon. The salmon was bland and lacked anything interesting. It did have a nice charred skin which was really the only flavour throughout the dish. My lettuce wraps also lacked flavour. The pork had a strange spongy texture, was covered in fat, and was really unappealing. I barely ate it and let the waitress know that I didn't enjoy this course. 

The desserts were alright - again lacking originality and were really nothing to write home about. They weren't memorable. 

At the $28 cost of lunch, it's unlikely that anyone will be bragging about the food served during summerlicious this year. Except maybe some instagrammable photos of the view!

I'll be sticking to the Noodle Bar and the Milk Bar if I'm ever to visit again.

- Ashley Marie"}
{"text":"Longest wait for dinner, almost an hour and half of dry wait before food came out. The food was ok but would not want to experience the wait again"}
{"text":"One of Toronto's example of great Food!
Three restaurants in the same place. Daisho is on the 3rd level.
  High ceilings with bright ambiance since it's all glass and you can see University Ave.'s busy street. 
    The sommeliers recommendation of our wine was great! It really matches what we had for dinner. 
   Food was delicious: Soy Tea Egg- if you like to be adventurous with flavors.
Chicken bun-yummy!
Shishito peppers- crisp with miso mayo dip
Chitarra Noodle- cooked to perfection
Chicken Thigh Ssam-build your own wrap
Honeydew Sherbet- very loft and refreshing
Strawberry shortcake- nice summer dessert

**David Chang has perfected his culinary expertise. This is the 3rd location that we've tried and he is consistent with all!"}
{"text":"Our second visit here this time around for dinner with friends and we could not have been more impressed. This is a great meeting place to take out of town friends and family or even for a casual meetup. The atmosphere is always buzzing and the service is friendly. We got some recommendations from our server (seems like everyone is well trained here to give a consistent message - \"brussel sprouts are to die for\"). Our favorite dishes were the lobster pasta, sweet and sour squash and the brussel sprouts (after all the brainwashing). The desserts were slightly disappointing, if there was one criticism this is an area to invest in for the restaurant to provide a well rounded dining experience. My recommendation would be to stop for drinks at Nikai on the second level before heading upstairs. They have a limited cocktail menu but the drinks at Nikai are hands down way better. Please note that the portions are more tapas style so you may have to end up ordering 6-8 dishes for a group of 4.  All in all, this place offers a great contemporary vibe with great tasting food"}
{"text":"I went with my girlfriend for the winterlicious meal. We both agreed the food was phenomenal. The BBQ pork bun while small was amazing. However the staff was very sub-par. When we walked in we were told we had to order quickly because the kitchen was closing... OK no big deal. I asked for a glass of soy milk (something I like to have with Korean food) the waitress brought me a over sized shot glass of soy milk with a large chunk of ice in it... Again no big deal. Throughout the meal waiters would come by and ask if you were done with your meal when clearly we were not, this must've happened at least 6 times during the 30min window we were there for. Finally we finished the amazing food and ask for the bill, lo and behold my 5 ounces of soy milk were costing me $2. I could've put up with any one or two of these things but the combo shows carelessness on the wait staff's part. Next time, take out."}
{"text":"I had a great dinner at Daisho last week when I visited Toronto. Sat outside on the terrace. I found service to be both friendly and attentive. 

I wanted to try so many different things on the menu since they all sounded so great, and none of the NYC Momofuku restaurants have these dishes on their menus. 

I had: 

Pakora bun
Fluke with avocado, black rice and blood orange
Snap pea salad with horseradish, jowl bacon and lily bulbs
Grilled striped bass with coconut curry, pickled clam and puri
Asparagus with crab, English muffin and egg
Grapefruit sorbet, macadamia nut and meringue. 

Everything was well prepared and delicious. Wish I had added another day to my trip because I would have loved to have returned to Daisho to try the other half of the menu."}
{"text":"I had the large format menu. We ordered two of them for a group of about 12 and it was more than enough food, especially if you order a bunch of sides. 

The brisket is very tender and falls apart with a fork. I enjoy the build your own sandwich concept, which allows me to pick and choose the amount of pickles, and meat. The brisket had a good mix of lean and fatty cuts for people to pick and choose. Would definitely recommend to large groups and carnivores."}
{"text":"Prices here are high and so is the amount of salt they use. I'm not convinced the prices justify what you're tasting. Everything was unbelievably salty and gave me a total sodium shock. If they toned down the salt usage, I'd probably be writing a 5-star review right about now. 
The pork and lettuce leaves were probably my least favourite dish of the night. They were tender but I much preferred the hanger steak. It was cooked perfectly but unfortunately, the portion was way too small. 
The rice cakes and broccoli were an interesting and great tasting dish but again way too salty.
The Roasted carrots and peanuts were such a weird combination but good. 
The brussel sprouts and puffed rice at Daisho are completely worth raving about. I'm getting hungry just thinking about them. 

Overall, you're probably paying based on the reputation of the whole Momofoku empire and the interior decor. The food is a solid 3 but ambiance adds another star."}
{"text":"Went to Momofuku Daisho for the Summerlicious lunch. The restaurant was nicely decorated, but there were ominous signs because the restaurant was only half full. It was easy to get reservations for 12:00 p.m.. Other restaurants in the area were fully booked.

I ordered the crispy pork bun, Chicken Thigh Ss√§m, and Chocolate
custard, coffee, candied orange. My friend ordered the fish fry and peaches desert. The pork bun was good, but I only got one small pork bun. The chicken thigh ssam was good, but nothing special. The chocolate custard was a gooey mess. My friend was happy with her food, but thought it was okay.

The service was nice, but I don't know why the waiters were walking around in jeans?

The main problem was the meal cost $75, but the food was just okay. The portions were small for $75.00."}
{"text":"Funny enough I came here thinking I was going to have a japanese cuisine lunch (just a guess based on the name). I was surprised when I had a look at the menu that it was more like an asian fusion type of cuisine, but even then more like chinese or korean fusion. Anyway, I was floored when I walked to the third floor of the building and saw Momofuku Daisho's restaurant. They have a beautiful restaurant... lots of wonderful natural lighting, beautiful tables, and large windows! 

Anyhow, once seated I was super excited to try out their winterlicious lunch menu for 28$ after seeing how impressive their restaurant looked. I read through the menu and was not amazed by the entree options, two of which feature rice (beef sausage or the spicy rice cakes).  It's so pedestrian to serve these kinds of dishes on a winterlicious menu...especially for the price. I had to choose either of these rice dishes as people in my table wanted to try each other's winterlicious meals. Anyway I settled for the beef sausage thinking it should be better than a rice cake.

For the winterlicious lunch menu I had the following:
Appetizer: Kimchi apple salad
Entree: Beef sausage with sticky rice
Dessert: Chocolate mousse

I found that the only dish worth praising was the dessert. Seriously the dessert was delicious. The brownie was so good...and I could tell there was just so much thought and creativity put into it. On the other hand, I was sorely disappointed with the kimchi apple salad and the beef sausage with sticky rice. 

The kimchi apple salad was for the most part, \"meh\". There was hardly any kimchi flavor, it looked red yes, but did not resemble a kimchi fermented taste. It tasted like an apple salad- it was sweet and lacking any personality. The jowl bacon on top was the only thing saving it.

As for the main entree, I tried the sausage and found that it was super salty and looked and felt undercooked.  It was kinda gross how red and soft it was when I picked at it during my meal. I have never had sausage cooked medium-rare before...and the mouth feel was also just as bad as how it looked lol. The sticky rice was over seasoned with something that resembled a sweetened fish sauce dressing. The rice on the bottom had a mix of crunchiness, I'm guessing from being fried. I liked the crunchiness but didn't like how oily it was.  As well the deep fried onion flakes didn't help. I just wasn't feeling the combination of everything in the dish... seemed too greasy and salty... Anyway,  I would totally not recommend this entree. This dish seems overpriced for what it is. I would have a much better meal experience eating sticky rice at a chinese restaurant for a fraction of this price."}
{"text":"We visited momofuku Daisho for their winterlicious dinner menu at Friday. 
Appetizer: we had the Apple kimchi salad and Squash salad, Apple kimchi one was like 2 apple cut in to cubes and mixed with kimchi sauce, served with 3 slice of bacon. Squash salad is warm and the seasoning is perfect!
Main: grilled trout- the fish is so so
Dessert: chocolate mousse- comes with dehydrated banana, frozen banana ice cream, chocolate ice cream and chocolate mousse. Too sweet for me and every bite of the chocolate cake made me choke.
Service is pretty nice 
Doesn't worth 45$ plus tax and tips- ends up 62$ each"}
{"text":"AMBIENCE:
It's on the 3rd floor and the patio is nice enough but they don't take reservations. Surprisingly it (patio) was empty on July 4th although all the tables inside were full. The patio is not fancy and the tables are very basic. The cutlery is very nice at Daish?.

I had heard and read mixed reviews. I wasn't impressed with the food other than the staples like the stirloin steak (18.5 oz) for two people that takes 40 mins to bake. 

I wanted to try the ribeye streak but the sizes cut by the chefs were too large for 2 people to manage. 

The waiter was friendly and made recommendations. 

Why mess with perfection? A traditional boa bun is perfect so why change it and add fried chicken and charge $6 each. It didn't have the light fluffiness of a typical steamed bun. Wouldn't get the fried chicken boa again.  

Seafood platter was standard with no show stopping sauces. Annoying that most sauces were mayonnaise-like with flavour added. It's a small amount of seafood for $98! 

The side of Brussels sprouts were tasty but definitely not healthy for you. How else could they taste so good?

I did fall in love with a cocktail they have called Stormy & Dark which had a bit of a kick to it. It was $14 but I would go back to the patio just to have that drink and no food. 

Attentive service Eg refilling water glasses and drink orders. 

But there are much better restaurants to try in the city at that ridiculous price point.  I expect to be wowed when I'm paying that much. And I was definitely not in regards to the food."}
{"text":"We went about 2 weeks after the restaurant opened. We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table. So we showed ourselves to the bar upstairs. My girlfriend ordered a bourbon but after one sip was pawning it off on me. 

The wait time wasn't ridiculous but the bar-stools were. The stools were so uncomfortable I was getting up every 5 minutes to stretch.

The food was a 'unique' experience. Seriously, don't go there if you are hungry. I don't remember exactly what I had but I think it was a bun or sliders of sorts. It was so small I had to grab a hot dog from a street vendor after we left. 

My girlfriend left hungry too but did absolutely love her ginger scallion noodles. 

I feel people go here more for the experience and since it's at the Shangri-La. For that it was cool. But for food satisfaction I likely won't return anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in both the service and the food at Daisho.

My companion and I ordered off the Summerlicious menu. My app, the pork bun, was the best part of the meal, and it was only average. The pork was very well-cooked but underseasoned and the bun was very dry and almost stale. My main course, the chicken ssam lettuce wraps, was very plain: lettuce, white rice, grilled chicken, mushrooms, and a generic spicy sauce. The chicken was moist, but I was not impressed. Our desserts were incredibly disappointing, especially considering that there was the renowned Milk Bar downstairs. There was an incredibly chalky biscuit with some soggy strawberries and flavorless cream, along with a chocolate not-quite-cake covered with a flavorless brown cream and some dry crumbs. 

The place looked great, though the tables were a bit too close to each other for intimate conversation. I enjoyed the clear view down to the street and around Toronto, but the greenhouse-style restaurant got very hot in the summer sun. 

The service was very slow - our lunch took an hour-and-a-half, and we were literally the first party to sit down for lunch. Our waitress was impatient and had to stand behind me to talk with us (again, because the tables were too tightly-packed). At the end of the meal, she charged us for the two courses we ordered off of Summerlicious a la carte, which was almost double the Summerlicious price, even though she had agreed that we didn't have to order dessert. When prompted, she insisted on bringing dessert if we wanted the Summerlicious price, even though we insisted it was a waste. We each had one bite of each dessert and left it. We must have offended our waitress, because other service staff handled us for the rest of the meal. 

Overall, I was disappointed in the food and surprised by the poor quality of service at Daisho. I would not recommend going for any reason."}
{"text":"cool place, gotta try it again, but loved the pork dish."}
{"text":"3 star in terms of premium dining. 
Add a star if you compare to norm. 

We tried Winterlicious plus Fluke (regular item). 

Winterlicious items were largely disappointing. Items served luke warm and taste was unimpressionable. 
Except - recommend Pork Shank.. Strong flavours!

Fluke - recommend as a regular menu item. Fresh and well balanced with nice plating. 

Service lacking - started with drinks on 2nd level.. (As we waited for table).. The server asked us to bring our drinks to or own table on the 3rd level! By balancing up stairs! This should not happen at any Hotel establishment."}
{"text":"Personally, I don't think the place needs any improvement. We were blown away by the overall experience. From the moment we walked-in, the decor caught our attention. Windows from ceiling to floor with trendy long tables and benches side by side to traditional tables. The restaurant has 3 floors, each with a different Asian menu from basic noodles and buns to high-end cuisine. Great selection of wine for pairing. I cannot make any comments on the desert since I did not have any. Why is this place not in Montreal yet??"}
{"text":"The food here was phenomenal. I came with a group of 11 friends and we called ahead to order one of their famous group formats: the beef brisket large format. We thought with a group our size that we would all have to order more food a la carte to supplement our food but we were kindly advised by our friendly waitor that the amount of food we get in the beef brisket large format would be more than enough by itself for our group! Thanks to the waitor recommendation we only ordered some starters and sides to supplement our meal variety. We couldn't even finish all the beef brisket. The brisket was to die for, oh so tender and especially where the fatty layers come in. It's served with Asian style buns, mango coleslaw, and scallion sauce. The restaurant staff was also paid attention to details like food allergies and made sure my friends portion didn't have any nuts in the condiments. The atmosphere was modern and elegant and overall one of the event experiences I've had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"I really don't get the hype about this place. The food is okay, not amazing, and it is on the pricey side. Service was good, and the ambiance was nice, but not enough to make me rush back."}
{"text":"If it's your first time and you don't know where to go, it can be a little off-putting. You need to go up the stairs, past Milk Bar and up to Daisho. They were quick to greet, friendly, courteous, and efficient to take our jackets. 

Service was fab. Water refills are on point! They are just a tad too pushy with the wine bottle list and the markup is a bit ridiculous. I just wanted 1 glass of sparkling w/ my seafood and a cocktail for my main. My husband had a beer and a flight of whiskey; all fairly priced.

We ordered the duck, being told it takes 20 mins, but it was closer to 45. No worries though as we ploughed through other goods prior to the duck.

1) Fluke : loved the celery. The fish was flavourful and the texture was soft and creamy. 

2) Oysters : These were fun. Great texture, great flavour. I just regret that they topped all 6 with the same fermented rye. Would have been nice to have half with and half without.

3) Chicken Bao : Could have skipped. Very tasty, but sloppy. I don't appreciate mayo dripping down my face  :(

4) Beef Tartare : Not my bag. Husband loved it. The use of sunflower seeds as filler was nice. They don't have an overpowering flavour and they remain soft. Great presentation!

5) Scallops as my main : When scallops are over-charred, they taste a bit like what I imagine poop tastes like. I am not a fan of this. A lighter char would be appreciated. The Jeruselum Artichokes are very strong. I only enjoyed 1 of the pieces as it was properly cooked and very sweet. 

6) Duck. I think it tasted a bit like ammonia - could have been the turnips. It was juicy, tender and a great portin size. My husband loved the duck; it's really his favourite.

7) Save the best for last : BRUSSEL SPROUTS! I love them. I found the recipe online and will recreate for Passover. They are vessels of flavour - bursting with spice, tangy vinegar and caramelized wonder. Get these if you go anytime soon. They will be off the menu in the coming weeks.

Can't wait to go back, but will wait for summer menus so we can try something different. Very lovely of the staff to acknowledge our anniverary. We had a little tasting of ice wine at the end - too kind!"}
{"text":"Great dinner experience.  Courses all tasted good.  Is it overpriced?  Maybe.  But you are here for the experience.  The tasting menu is pretty well thought out.  I really like the chicken dish that was cooked  to perfection - moist and tender.  Has some great rare wine by the glass, thanks to Coravin...  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Let's be straight up. You are paying for the vibe and you should know that having gone through the noodle bar to get here. Upstairs you aren't going to be crammed together with strangers pretty much sitting on the lap of your neighbour. No communal tables here. And to that I say Amen!

Yes it was pricey, but it is not a meal for which I begrudged paying. I loved the oysters. Simple and divine. The brussels sprouts were great though I wasn't a fan of the potato nuggets as I found them unnecessarily rich. The hanger steak was a show stopper and was my second favourite dish. I wasn't wowed by the chicken thighs, but they weren't bad either. The roasted rice cakes didn't blow my mind either, but they too were interesting. Simply put, I got to try a number of dishes on the menu and I went away satisfied; not all were true hits, but enough were that I want to come back."}
{"text":"I'm going to make this short and sweet.  I have now been to this restaurant 3 times and have tried roughly 40% of the menu items on the lunch menu and the chicken bun and roasted rice cakes are still my absolute favourite things here.  I have now tried the brussel sprouts as well and loved them too but I could happily go just for the first two items alone."}
{"text":"Just tried this restaurant with a group if friends on Saturday for dinner. 
Location is a bit obscure. The main entrance is off the hotel lobby, and then we must walk through the noodle bar on the main floor to go upstairs. On the 3rd floor, is a small simple space with simple decor. 

We had ordered the Bo-Ssam (slow roast pork shoulder) before we came. It comes with a oysters and some sauces, lettuce and Kim chi side dishes.  The shoulder had a thick fat layer before the meat was exposed but the meat was very tender, nothing new in the spices. It's a fun dish to eat with lettuce wraps but we will try other meat items next time. 

We also ordered about half the menu because we wanted to try everything. 
Items we liked: apple Kim chi salad, butter biscuits, pakora buns, Brussels sprouts, potato gratin, cucumber salad, foie gras was okay, would be better if it came with something to spread on. 

Items we could have live without: burger buns (small white flat bow around small beef party, tasteless), charred cabbage and artichoke, Arctic char. 

Service: mediocre. *** We were told to hold a few times when we wanted something and there was lack of attention. He didn't realize that plate settings and napkins were missing for some people. He got an order wrong and brought out something we didn't order, and when asked, he didn't offer the possibility that it might have been his mistake but ensure that we did order it. His head was all over the place, trying to multitask. Perhaps it was not his fault because the servers were spread out thin but four different people brought out food and described in detail what was in the dish. It would have been better to have one attentive host then five that did mediocre jobs.

A note about wine. We are not usually picky but our host affirmed that his job was supposed to tie the meal together for us but he did not recommend a great wine for the meal. I heard they had a great list but didnt get to try it.  We ended up giving him a $135 tip for mediocre. The things people get away with these days!!!  For this they should have given us complimentary grappa for dessert!"}
{"text":"Momofuku Daish? is located inside the Shangri-la Hotel.  The bottom floor you have the Momofuku noodle bar. Momofuku Daish? is located on the third floor. Daish? is a 
is a family style Asian fusion type food.  The dishes are  meant to be shared. So you can order a variety of dishes and share family style or or can order your own dishes.  We came here for my bestie's Birthday. Winterlicious event was happening with their 3 course set menu at a set price. My bestie and I decided to only order from the a la carte. They have the Winterlicious menu along with only a few a la carte menu items.  Not their usual full a la carte menu.   You can order the items from the Winterlicious menu separately.  So we ordered the fried chicken bao and the crispy pork belly for our appetizers.  The bao was great and tasty. The pork belly however was out of this world. It was nice and crispy on the outside and juicy and flavourful on the inside. It's was on a bed of mushed up Kim chi sauce. So good! For our shared mains we order their must have rice cakes with sausage, Chinese broccoli.  The rice cakes are crispy on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside and it's a bit spicy. Excellent!  They also have their famous brussel sprouts dish which are brussel sprouts baked and soaked in fish sauce. Amazing!!  On their regular menu Daish? the duck was on their menu.  I made sure when I made reservations they had duck on this menu. We were told we had the last duck. The duck was so amazing.  Roasted and thinly sliced with some mustard sauce and pickled cabbage and pear so so so good. It was lean with no fat and so flavourful, definitely the best duck I've ever had.  Worth the price tag it came with. It's also the most
expensive duck dish I've ever had. Haha.  For dessert we got the chocolate mousse dish with cream and a lemon cookie. Since it was my bestie's Birthday they gave us a
complimentary banana and squash sorbet. I have to admit I didn't like the sorbet much. It was different and very \"squashy\" as our server would described it.  Our server was great and very helpful however when my bestie open her Birthday gift which was a box of squish gummies and we tried it she told us \" no outside desserts allowed.  I felt that comment was uncalled for it was not like we didn't order desserts. We had 3 desserts!! But outside of that it did not diminished my experience. Still a 5 star!

All in all great experience and will highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Momofuku Noodle Bar, but I was not a fan of Daisho.  I'll start by giving credit where due - the space is very elegant with big open windows overlooking the elegant stretch of University St. But there were just a few too many miss-steps with this establishment. 

For starters, the menu is unbalanced. There are limited offerings of more substantial dishes. In addition, there seem to be item that are well out of the price point for many diners (consider a seafood appetizer platter for $128, or steaks ranging from $80 to $200), or whiskey for $30 for 1oz.

Second, the food was overall way too sloppy and whimsical to the point of comical. This is the complete opposite of Momofuku Noodle Bar which offers very simple well thought-out, well executed dishes. I understand head chef David Chang is very playful, but I am certain that whatever we were served was not part of his vision, but a misinterpretation of his vision by those he entrusted.

Here's what we ordered:

Arctic Char - seaweed, black garlic, roe  $15
--------------
Rating: 3/5

This was a nice tartar, but it was on the small side and too pedestrian. In terms of flavor, it would not stand up against even your average sushi offering. The only nice accent was the black garlic.

Dry Aged Beef Carpaccio (McGee Farms, ON) - pho, thai basil, charred pearl onion  $19
--------------
Rating: 5/5

This was a great dish. Lots of flavors there. The flavor from the gelled pho came out well pronounced and delicious.

Hanger Steak Ss√§m (McGee Farms, ON) - kimchi, onion, bibb lettuce  $26
--------------
Rating: 5/5

This was a winning dish. The steak was super flavorful. The two sauces were very nice. It was, however, a small portion.

Secreto Ss√§m (Kunan Farm, ON) - apple xo, mustard mayo, bibb lettuce  $26
--------------
Rating: 2/5
The pork was under-cooked. The sauce was neither apple xo nor mustard mayo. It tasted more like cream cheese mixed with sriracha. There were small pieces of shiitake mushrooms in a brine that was way too sweet. Overall not a great dish

Apple Kimchi Salad - smoked jowl bacon, arugula, maple labneh  $16
--------------
Rating: 0/5
What a train wreck of a dish! I must say, it's one of the weirdest things I've ever tasted. If I had read the ingredients more carefully, I should have known to stay from this dish. What the heck were they smoking when they came up with this dish?

Cauliflower Bhaji - lime pickle, green chili vinegar, cilantro  $12
--------------
Rating: 2/5
The cauliflower was doused with too much spice that was unpleasant. The dish was also way too salty.

The service was UNPLEASANT. All staff had a frown. The waitress was especially unfriendly. When we asked to replace the Apple Kimchi Salad, we were told \"I'll have to check with the chef\". This would be considered an uncustomary reaction in most establishments, but especially at such a high level establishes which charges $16 for a SALAD.  She did take it back, and said it's been taken off our bill. When we got our bill, surprise surprise, the salad magically re-appeared!

By the end of the evening, I was regretting I hadn't dined just two floors below at the pleasant Momofuku Noodle Bar."}
{"text":"I came as part of a large party to celebrate our friend's birthday. The atmosphere certainly exudes fine dining, with an expansive window view. The food was sumptuous. The pickled cucumbers, the rectangular platters of juicy crusted brisket pink with perfect doneness, the various beautifully plated dishes we foolishly ordered in addition to the large format for which we couldn't finish---dining here was a real treat.

Of the side dishes, I enjoyed the rice cakes (spicy, chew, and lightly crispy) and the agnolotti (kind of sweet and met well with the mince on top). My girlfriend particularly enjoyed the duck breast which came with pear and greens. We all enjoyed the brisket---I was stuffing bao after bao with double helpings of brisket, papaya/daikon slaw, topped with green onion and ginger sauce and crab mayo. What a decadent, soulful, and exciting combination! To me, heavily nostalgic of all the family dinners I've had in the past involving Peking duck with the sharing and constructing the wrap and having a wonderful time together with loved ones.

Special mention to service who were very much on point. They triple checked allergies with my party, and arranged for the peanuts to be served separately from the slaw and far away from the guest who was allergic---well done.

An excellent experience overall---a definitely solid choice for any sort of special celebration. Recommended"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal at Momofuku Daisho and was very impressed with the food and service. I came with a party of 6 and our server was very helpful in making sure we ordered enough food and the right dishes. We ordered the buttermilk biscuits which were the best biscuits I've ever had in my life and I don't even like biscuits. We also got the heirloom tomato salad, the poached cod, the beef short ribs, the rice cakes and the chanterelles. My favourite dish was definitely the rice cakes, they were spicy but not painfully spicy. All of the food was really good and I would recommend someone to order our exact order except maybe the heirloom tomato salad as that didn't really wow me. My only complaint about Daisho is the cocktail list. I expected a higher level of drinks available- more unique tasting cocktails with fruits, flowers, etc. I had the lavender lemonade and it literally just looked and tasted like a normal lemonade. Other than the drink list I would happily return to Daisho! It was oddly affordable too we split all of our dishes between 5 of us and I had two cocktails and my bill was only $60."}
{"text":"Excellent, attentive service but I wasn't particularly blown away by the food. We ordered the crispy chicken bao, carpaccio, hanger steak ssam (lettuce wraps), rice cakes and the sorbet and apple crumble for dessert. I liked the rice cakes the best, they were nice and crunchy yet chewy at the same time.  The desserts were also decent."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Christmas Eve. They tried to seat us at the only communal table and when I told them that that wasn't going to happen and that I wanted the table by the window, the host told us it was reserved for a customer with a bad back lol. What a load of crap. Anyways....we were seated at the table we wanted and were greeted by an excellent waitress. To start we ordered the duck buns which were awesome, oysters and scallops - very good but overpriced. Then came the hanger steak, chicken thigh and duck with carrots and nugget potatoes as sides. Was impressed by all the dishes.......especially the steak! I enjoyed the casual vibe of the resto and would definitely go back. Overall I was impressed and looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"OMG sooooo good!!! 

First off I would like to start off by saying a knock to those who gave this a lower rating silly based on the Winterlicious and Summerlicious visits, yes it's a great program to get an idea of the cuisine profile, and yes it gives opportunities for those who normally might thing certain restaurants are out of their price range to try something new, but I always believe with those programs it can be a hit or miss, even to the best. 

Not to sound snobbish, but if you want to have a brilliant experience the best that a place has to offer, it's not going to come from a discounted menu, think of the logic behind that, for those who normally don't have the budget to eat at places like that, you probably won't come back, despite telling yourself, \"how dare he... If it was good I would have spend more money there\", true diners know.... 

Our party had the large groups sharing menu of beef brisket, and it was sooo juicy, tender and delicious, not much more to say there. It is recommended for about 7 people but it could have easily fed 12. We did also order three extra sides, but my goodness this dish was just perfection in a bun which I will be drooling over for the rest of however long my memories will work. 

A must visit, go with 10, get the beef brisket and get stuffed!!"}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: A wonderful space with amazing service; it's best enjoyed in large groups. Oh, and don't bother bringing a coat because there's no place to hang it. #DesignFail.

I have yet to tried Shoto, but between the Noodle Bar and Daisho, Daisho wins hands down. Located on the third floor, you get to dine in a spacious glass box with ample natural lighting. This is not a knock against the food, but the highlight of the night was definitely the service - the staff were attentive, knowledgeable and super-friendly. It certainly raises the standard in this town and serves warning to many of the establishments that try to get away with shoddy service.

Now, let's get to the food shall we? I came with 6 other DCs and my recommendation is to come as a group. The menu is split up into two parts: 1) moderately priced individual dishes and 2) large meat dishes that serve 6-8 people. They bring you a spicy, pickled cucumber dish as you decide what to order. We ended up getting the FRIED CHICKEN (about 20 huge, juicy chicken covered in a sweet batter and accompanied with onion pancakes and various garnishes that you can wrap it in - not sure why you have to order in bulk...), four orders of their STEAMED BUNS (two buns per order and filled with peameal bacon and a mustard/yolk sauce - delicious sauce but I prefer my pork belly) and their PEAR TRIFLE (served in a massive bowl with black sesame ice cream on the side - who knew a group dessert could be so amazing?!) for dessert. WE. WERE. STUFFED. It ended up coming out to $60 per person including drinks, tax and tip.

Daisho recommends that you give them a day's notice if you're planning on ordering their large meat dishes, but we were lucky they had some available when we arrived. Looking around at the other tables, I can assure you that their BO SAAM and BEEF RIBEYE will give you enough protein that you can skip your steroid injection for the next month! Most of their dishes are served in the kitschy Chinese dishes that are found in Chinatown. Given that the recommendation by our server was to order N+1 of the smaller dishes, it would seem like the ordering style is the same as well!

Finally, they have an extensive drinks menu that can become expensive in a jiffy. The beers were, oddly, cheaper than what their Noodle Bar charges. My DCs enjoyed their cocktails, but at $16+, they're definitely a treat. If you're into the vino or the bubblies, you better get that corporate card out.

Of note, vegans are NOT welcome as their menu will not accommodate your ridiculous dietary restrictions. However, despite this culinary vision, Daisho suffers from the same idiotic design flaw of Noodle Bar - there is no place to hang your coat (not even under the bar area...for reals?!). I suppose if you just avoid coming in the winter, you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Probably one of the tastiest (hanger) steak I've had. Finally got to visit because of a birthday dinner and I most certainly would come back. For apps, we ordered the crispy chicken buns, I loved the bun, it soft and slightly sweet. The chicken was nice and crispy, my only complain was the sauce, a tad too overwhelming of something that reminded me of Franks Hot Sauce. The hanger steak I actually had to get as take out, because the wait was too long and I had to leave a little early (my fault). I ended up eating it at the Timmy's across, but it was delicious. The steak was a perfect medium rare, but the best part was the onions paired up with each slice of steak. I had an wonderful experience and I'm looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with a group of 12. We received the most amazing treatment and hospitality.  Dave Chang personally invited us to come as a way of making up for a previous visit.  Our group was beyond spoiled this evening.  Everything from the champagne welcome in the lounge to the various courses and wine pairings.. The staff were incredible and attentive.  David came to our table many times for pictures and to explain dishes.  The head chef Sam also came by often. Our sommelier was fantastic and everything was perfectly paired.  We had a delicious mackerel to start.  It was like a sashimi and melted in your mouth.  Accompanied with a sort of mushrooms salad with had so many textures and cloud berries.  It was out of this world. After we enjoyed an intensely satisfying scrambled eggs with truffles and peppered toast!! It was comforting and soooo decadent.  Our third meal was Chang's famous noodles in broth with huge pieces of lobster,.  Broth had a delightful lingering warmth and heat.  After that we had our fried chicken with what felt like a million sides. They even made a separate few dishes for the pescatarian in the group. There were also 8 little pots of caviar on the table for us!  8!!! We were also served a delicious pork ribs... We really had so much food it was insane.  Our wine was constantly topped up and it was all too much.  Just as we're about to explode our second last dish comes out which is shaved foi gras served over candied nuts.  Insanely good. The foi gras just melts and the sweet crunch from the nuts is unexpected but a match made in heaven.  Our final meal is dessert. Two desserts came out.  One was a frozen chocolate ice cream cake from outer space.  This thing was insanely good.  The second was similar to a lemon meringue pie and it was like crazy crack! I couldn't stop eating it.!  By far the best out of the two.  We all left with take home gifts of autographed lucky peach magazines and some kimchi and leftover.  This was by far one of the best days of my life and I cannot thank David and his team Sam, Adrian, Jonathan and our lovely waiters and waitresses.  We will continue to come to Momofuku for future special occasions and we wish David and everyone continued success.. I effing love this place."}
{"text":"First review with Yelp and I have to do this one since it is one of the worst experience I have ever had. We came in at 5:30pm and there were only 3 other tables that were occupied. The server took our order around 5:40 and we ordered 5 things. It was chicken bun, rice cake, trout, pork chop and brussel sprout. The first 2 items came within 10 minutes and then the whole thing went radio silence for 1 hour! The server never checked on us even though they filled up our water. They never gave us update so I waived on one of the waitresses and she told us that they have to give priority to a bigger party (btw they came after us). Meanwhile other smaller party came after us got their food before us and some even checking out. 

I was getting mad so I decided to call the server to give us the bill and she called the manager. The manager then gave us this excuae of the pork chop needed 45 min to cook! They never told us this! Then she blamed her server onstead of taking responsibilities for this mistake. In the end I lost my appetite and decided to leave anyway. They apologized but there is no way I am coming back. Save your money! Everything is overpriced and overrated. There are better food to eat. Sorry Dave Chang but you suck!"}
{"text":"Momofuku Daisho is located on the third floor of the Shangri-La hotel where there are high ceilings, a lot of natural lighting and super spacious in comparison to the Noodle Bar downstairs. My friend and I ordered chicken kaarage bun, chicken ssam and the shrimp burger. Everything was amaaazing but prices are a bit steep ($6/bun, $27 for chicken+lettuce) Our bill came out to $76 before tip for 2 (lunch). The food and service was good though... so I would come back :)."}
{"text":"So without ranting about how service levels at \"hip\" restaurants such as momofuku are incredibly poor, or that overhyped restaurants like this one just dont fit the bill, I'm going to attempt to write an honest and clear review.

I like to think that I know my shit, I eat at great restaurants all over america and  i've certainly developed a set of expectations, they are fairly simple. If your paying alot of money, the food should be great and the service should match.
Thats it. Its really a simple formula. Mistakes happen, but egregious snobbery and lack of quality are not acceptable. 

Firstly, the decore is gorgeous, while I do think that splitting the place into 3 levels is a cool idea I just dont think it works that well, it feels disjointed and un connected and weird, but that said the restaurant is gorgeous. 

Service fails on a few levels, and while I want to say that the general manager was a prince and a few of the other servers were saints, its really only fair to speak about the folks who took orders and generally served them. 

Our server (on the 2nd floor) was absolutely horrendous, I'm not sure if she was some brand of hipster masochist hell bent on making people's nights horrible but she certainly tried her darndest. I'm spending 150 between myself and my friend, giggle a bit, recommend a few things and skip away with a smile,come back and ask how the food is and see if i need anything,  I'm not tipping you 20% to look depressed. 

One part that really stuck out was one of the managers (whom i assume has been let go by now). After we returned an order of wings (which were absolutely horrific), he aggressively confronted us about why we returned them. I think there is an appropriate way to do this, he managed to do the opposite. If this were the jungle I'd have made minced meat of him. 

The food: 

Let me tell you, those rice cakes were out of the freaking world, that is a special, special dish. Wings were horrific, honestly horrific. Reuben Bun is to die for, Shrimp bun is just OK. Crab was great but at that rate they really would have had to try hard to mess it up. Drinks were solid. Cauliflower was just meh (but id probably order it again:) ). 

In summation, I will never come back to momofuku. I will never take a date there, I will refuse eating there on business, I will never ever ever come back, I will tell my friends it sucks, I will tell their friends it sucks.

 The mixture of inconsistent food and inconsistent service is just too great to fathom paying prices like that.   Is it uncouth to complain based on price? Im not sure, maybe it is, maybe it isnt, but honestly when you charge high prices you better offer high quality service and on that mark momofuku fails both on the quality of the product and delivery. It was a sad night for toronto (sadder then rob ford allegedly smoking the crack)."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 4 stars for potential. My experience there was more 3-3.5 stars but I think that's a function of a new restaurant working out some kinks.

For full disclosure: I used to live in New York and have been to Momofuku Ssam Bar many times, and Ko a couple. (Never went to the original Noodle Bar.) The quality and originality of the food here is above that of Ssam Bar, though the setting was a little too staid for me. Louder music and darker lighting would've set a much better atmosphere. Our waiter didn't seem as well versed in the wine list as I've come to expect from the Momofuku staff (they always have great recs in NYC), though the bottle itself was a nice pairing for what we ordered -- oysters, wd-50 chicken, trout, brussels sprouts, apple salad, apple soup and chocolate dessert. Standouts were the brussels sprouts, oysters and apple soup. Overall, what they are making here is miles more fun and complex than most other restaurants in Toronto which have fallen back on making rustic Italian or Canadian comfort-ish food.

This is way more expensive than Ssam Bar, though we probably could've done with 5 and not 7 dishes -- the meat mains are pretty generously sized. I hope this does well because the city needs a breath of fresh air, but sadly the place was only busy and not jam-packed (albeit on a Tuesday)."}
{"text":"Visited here due to its popularity, which turned out to be a big disappointment. The only good things about this famous place are the decor and service. The food just didn't live up to its own fame, not to mention to other popular places in Toronto. We ordered the chicken bun, shrimp crudo, pasta, poached cod and rapini. The chicken bun tastes like mayonnaise with hot and sour chicken nugget - far worse than the bun in Monga. Shrimp crudo is ok, a regular shrimp ceviche. Pasta is, salty, tastes like pasta covered with stir fried leftover of ground pork. The poached cod has nice presentation, typical huge plate with sauce painting on it, but the taste was just so so. Rapini feels like a veggie dish found in any Chinese restaurant, but way saltier. I seriously don't recommend this place if David Chang is not around, at least he is cute to look at."}
{"text":"Well, I tried sending the folks at Momofuko a letter through their website, but their feeback section on their website didn't work for me ... so, here it goes:

Dear Momofuko:

I am writing to express my concern about an incident that occurred on the evening of January 18, 2013.

I had made a reservation, well in advance of the aforementioned date. 
It was my girlfriends birthday.

When we arrived, we were sat at the bar. 

I was disappointed that my reservation was made well in advance and we were sat at the bar to have our dinner. 

I understand that at many establishments in Toronto, this is commonplace, however, I figured that booking in advance would have made a difference, considering that there were many, many tables in the place.

The service was slow.
Our plates weren't changed when new courses were brought, and the old ones were quite dirty.

The food was good.
Our server was very kind (she was also the bartender). 
The wine was excellent and not over-priced. 

Lastly. I understand the concept of the restaurant, however, when making the reservation, I noted that we would be having vegetarian meals. 

Most places I go, if there aren't a lot of options, the chef always makes a special meal for me. I don't care about the price. 

When my reservation was received, someone could have checked in regarding your limited options.  

I would have asked when I arrived - I don't have a problem asking, but I honestly didn't feel welcomed sitting at the bar. 

I am going to give you the opportunity to explain why this could happen, and you are willing to do about it. 

I waited until I wasn't upset about it to write you. 

Sending thanks in advance for your consideration."}
{"text":"It's a bit embarrassing to admit that I've never been to Momofuku Daisho in NY, only the noodle bar and the milk bar. So I had my first experience in Toronto for summerlicious.

The space has a great visual impact from the street and must have looked fantastic in renderings, but it's not so great to actually experience. The glass cube traps the heat and creates weird acoustics. It's excellent for eavesdropping, not so good for hearing the person across from you. The view of University sort of felt like an intro to a movie in the 80s, which I guess could be nice if you like the feeling of floating above traffic.

I was really happy with the menu. The barbecue pork bun, grilled trout, and cheesecake were all fantastic. I was pleasantly surprised with their unique pairings, since usually it feels like the chef is trying too hard. These were spot on.

Toronto is not known for its cocktails, but the ones here were perfect.

Just be warned that when I ordered an americano they gave me decaf espresso. Cruel joke? Perhaps they psychically knew I'm trying to cut back on caffeine. Skip the coffee."}
{"text":"Went here for Winterlicious lunch. We were seated at the bar, and service was excellent. My water glass was never empty, and the staff were very friendly, and prompt. For $28 + tax and tip, I think I could have more food...but it was pretty good. For my starter, I had the roasted pumpkin soup. There were some banana bread croutons in it, and that was quite a unique and unexpected addition to the soup, which was very flavourful and delicious. For my main, I had the Fish Ss√§m, which was a breaded fillet served with lettuce, and various sauces. It was pretty good, but I personally am not a huge fan of breaded fish fillets. For dessert, my friend and I shared the brownie and fig pudding. Can I just say that the fig pudding tasted like Christmas and it was SO DELICIOUS. I can't put into words. When I tasted it, I couldn't help but smile...when a dessert can evoke true joy in me, that's when I know it's a good one."}
{"text":"Went with 3 other friends to celebrate a birthday. Not impressed at all. the food was only \"ok\". The price is ridiculous for its quality. The so called steak took forever to come out even though we were told it would take 35mins, not to mention the fat and actual meat balance was horrible. charging that price for fat and bone that isn't very \"nice\" to your customers. We ordered the biscuit which were simply scones that weren't even that great the 3 sauces offered were nothing out of the norm and in particular the \"spicy sauce\" tasted like wet socks. We also ordered the chicken buns. 2 buns for $12 that literally tasted like a boneless deep fried buffalo wing didn't show any chef skills were required and it lacked presentation. The so called chicken wrap was probably the best dish out of all of them and that's because its actually juicy. But, it was simply just marinated with cha siu sauce and grilled. It was also presented poorly and messy on the plate. I will not be returning again and will not be recommending this place to any of my friends either."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, the atmosphere was lovely and its conveniently located DT Toronto. Though if you're driving, you have to dish out an extra 30 dollars to park at the hotel, but well worth it!
The food overall was very interesting, a bit on the saltier side if you order some of the fusion dishes. Portions are very nice so you will definitely walk away satisfied, they also have a nice collection of wine, its a must to enjoy the food there."}
{"text":"Loved it! Been meaning to try this resto for years and finally went. It's up on the 3rd floor with an amazing view. It's slightly impractical as it tends to get really hot in there (effet de serre). The food was amazing: the chicken buns were perfect and I'm salivating now just thinking about them. Try the rice cakes only if you can handle spicy foods. It was too much for my dinner partner to handle. And those Brussels sprouts are the BEST Brussels sprouts I've had in my life. I wanted to take an extra order to go."}
{"text":"Ambiance is very nice and trendy! Staff works together to make the experience very inviting. 

They were out of duck buns so we hesitantly ordered the eggplant bun (which was said to be better anyway.) it was fantastic paired with the squash salad (interesting dressing), and their tater tot like potatoes was a surprise! 

Though I never opt for vegetarians style dining on any given night, we shared a fulfilling meal for 2 for about $170 (including handful of cocktails.)

The hotel is super posh inside! With the hotel bar bustling with people and live music on a Saturday night. Very attractive people! Hot date night"}
{"text":"tldr: Overhyped Japanese fusion food with a hefty price tag. Ambiance for a smart casual date to a fancy night out. Food is not bad, it is just overpriced and sometimes misses the mark.

The Momofuku Daish? restaurant is located on the third floor of the momofuku complex across the street from the Hilton Toronto. We stayed there and had a view of the restaurant, so we thought, \"why not go here?\" Make reservations. Ordered several dishes (4-5 dishes for two people, adds up to around 130 CAD). Dishes are interesting, but not guaranteed to be good. Wine and cocktail menu robust. You can also impress by ordering steaks by the oz. Cool seating area with floor to ceiling windows. The seating area is spacious, high ceilings, and low-key music plays. I would not come back here unless I wanted to try new Asian twists on standard fare food items."}
{"text":"Oysters, Seafood ramen, shitake buns, all good. Shrimp buns were missing the acid element so we squeezed some lemon. Nice place, good drinks, relaxed.
Seating isn't the most comfortable so I wouldn't linger here more than 1.5 hrs."}
{"text":"I am so in love with Momofuku Daisho's large format menu. For my sister's birthday this year, we had the beef brisket option and it is supposed to serve ~6 people but would've easily fed about 10. My heart almost stopped when they brought out the gigantic platter of beef brisket - large chunks of tender, juicy meat. It comes with a couple of accompanying garnishes, completed with unlimited steam buns (in my opinion, the best part!) The beef was so juicy and fatty that I really could only eat 2-3 self-assembled buns. We all left extremely satisfied and had a ton of leftover for the next day! I will be back to try out a different large format menu for sure!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting from Dallas, TX and this was our first dining experience in Toronto. We absolutely loved this place! It's small but trendy. The staff was amazing and super friendly. Our server was also the bartender and was very attentive and gave great suggestions. The chicken bun and the fried chicken entree were both outstanding. I hope we have time to go back before heading back home."}
{"text":"Came for a winterlicious dinner.... Food was amazing! The chef threw in an amuse bouche as well as an INCREDIBLE little extra mini dessert of coconut pineapple sorbet as an added bonus. 
GO TRY THEIR BAOs! They are amazing!
Service was good, staff explained each dish clearly... but food was very very slow!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting from LA and heard Daisho was the spot. The steak restaurant located in downtown Toronto had high glass walls in the dining area, providing patrons nice views of University Ave.  The servers were nice and accomodating. However, I can't say the same things about our dinner. The steak was way undercooked. Even after sending it back to the kitchen, it still came back raw. We were never asked how we wanted it cooked the first time around. And the sides were, meh...The one good thing the menu offered was the pork chop, flavorful and juicy. The next time we go to Toronto and crave steak, I think we'll just go across the street and eat at Ruth's Chris."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for Winterlicious. It's a beautiful restaurant but the service was quite disappointing. We were seated at a large table that was designated at a shared table even though there were tables near the windows that were available. When we asked if it would be possible to move to a table there, they told us it was for groups of 3-4. This was clearly a lie because there were 2-seaters available. When we pointed that out, they said that another reservation had a special request put through for those table. Up until we paid for our meal and even when we left, there were tables near the window for 2 people that sat empty. What a waste of an opportunity. They could have easily accommodated our request and turned our experience into a positive one. 

The food itself was not bad, but even the Winterlicious menu had a bad price-to-value ratio. I would have been happy to pay extra to get some good service but that clearly did not happen. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place has THE best view.... gorgeous.  
And the food is great too.  I highly recommend the Fried Chicken... definitely some fusion going on here, but this is my favourite dish at this restaurant and I get it every time.  I take my boss here, co-workers, any time I am looking to impress.  
Some other good items:  Nugget Potatoes are excellent as well as the Onion Rings, the Beef Skirt Ssam was also delicious.  
On our last visit, we ordered the Seafood Platter ($55).  I was a little disappointed here... nothing special in my opinion, and I thought the portion was pretty small for $55.  Meh, I won't order it again, but back to that Fried Chicken.... so awesome.  

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Been wanting to visit a David Chang restaurant for a  long time now with the thought that it would be one of his NY outposts.  Never thought this would be first up, but I'm certainly glad it was.

Was a little concerned that attending with a party of 2 wouldnt provide the same effect as having one of the larger format dinners.  While the larger dinner looked amazing, my fears proved to be unfounded.

Had the chicken wing buns to start which was an abolsutely flawless and tasty riff on classic flavors.  Could have had 2 more orders.  Next, ordered the buckwheat noodles.  Not sure they are 22 dollars tasty and the menu called out for quail or squab when all I found were a bunch of tiny mushrooms.  Still the deep earthy flavor of the dish was vastly appealing.  Ordered the secreto for a main dish which was like having your own mini large-format dinner at the table.  Came with a good amount of thinly and perfectly cooked pork with lettuce, xo sauce, and chopped clams.  Assemble as you wish.  Fantastic.  Tried a bit of the GF's ribeye with the same do it yourself mentality and it was some of the best (and beefiest tasting) steak I've ever had.

Had a slice of the crack pie (aptly named) and the cucumber dessert as well.  Cucumber was beautifully plated and somewhat tiny for its 14 dollar price tag yet the flavor combination of the various elements worked well.

Had great service in a memorable location with wonderful views and had a very good wine/beer list to boot.

A wonderful restaurnt and looking forward to my next D. Chang experience."}
