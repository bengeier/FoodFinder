{"text":"Affordable and very tasty. Both the pho and the grilled food is good. I usally have the Pho Dac Biet. Staff is friendly, and understand both English and French. At times, however, the service can be a bit slow, but not to the point where it gets infuriating. The decor is plain, but it's clean and the TV is not too loud."}

{"text":"Came here with my favourite uncle today and I was famished! My uncle suggested the pho (tonkinoise), the bun bo hue or the mang vit soup (duck and bamboo). I opted for the bun bo hue (Hue's spicy specialty soup). I was surprised at how big the portions were for the price. My bowl was 10$ and I would say it's the equivalent of an extra-large bowl. While it didn't lack on portion size, it did lack on taste. I had way too much noodles and broth with very little meats and veg. It's not bad but I'm pretty sure you can find something better around here. Since it's out of my way, I don't think I'll be back anytime soon."}
