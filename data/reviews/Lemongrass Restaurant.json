{"text":"One of the worst services we have ever experienced!  They don't explain their dishes well at all and then charge ridiculous amounts for things we didn't actually want. Talk about putting a damper on a rainy day"}
{"text":"Not great.  Service is sub par. Not very friendly.  Food is mid line ok .....  Disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm really not one to complain or be annoyingly picky but the food just wasn't anywhere close to what I was expecting.  For anyone who's eaten real sticky rice before, in Asia or Toronto or anywhere else, you'll know this \"sticky rice\" to be a poor imposter. Shanghai noodles were ordered, which was my fault as I was expecting pad see ew (spicy wide rice noodles), but it was pretty tasteless - apart from the oil and sauce.   Shrimp cold rolls were tasty and tom yum soup was nothing to write home about. Felt too badly to complain to the staff, plus my wife was not happy with my level of dissatisfaction, but the 3 stars are for their attentiveness and general warmth.  Bottom line: they can do better on the food, and so can you."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing this restaurant because I've been coming here for a long time and I think it needs more credit than the one star it currently has. It is a decent restaurant in all respects, food is good, service is ok, all in all I'd say it's about average for a somewhat upscale thai fusion restaurant. The purple Saigon is a personal favourite."}
{"text":"Overall, fulfilled my thai craving. This place has a calm quiet atmosphere. There were a number of great lunch specials for an affordable price. Fresh food, full flavours. We ordered a black bean pad thai which was spicy, beef was cooked perfectly and among other things the cold rolls were well made. There was one server with an accent almost too thick to understand, but we were served quickly and with smiles."}
{"text":"Try the veggie taro spring rolls!  Friendly staff, very accommodating. Their vegetarian menu items do NOT include chicken broth. Their vegetarian pad thai equally does not contain any fish ingredients."}
{"text":"This was one of the most disappointing meals. I ordered takeout including Pad Thai, mango salad, spring rolls, sticky rice, young chow fried rice, chicken satay and Singapore curried crab and mango sticky rice.   We threw more than half the food away because it was so disgusting. The sticky rice wasn't sticky rice at all - it was overlooked regular rice with coconut milk.  My kids took a couple of bites of Pad Thai and refused to eat anymore (and they love Pad Thai). The spring rolls were vile...so oily.  The fried rice was also oily.  The salad was blech and the satay tasted like feet. The crab was actually very tasty which is why I gave this review one star.  The mango sticky rice was beyond disappointing, especially considering this is my favourite dish from any Thai restaurant.   The staff was nice and I really appreciated their gluten free menu but given how bad the food was all I feel is that I was just robbed of $145.   I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Horrible food do not go here expecting authentic Thai its the worst Chinese food I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my girlfriend as we saw the restaurant plastered with awards and nominations so thought we'd give it a try.  Ordered their Pad Thai and Pineapple rice and honestly did not think it was that special. Tried really hard to understand why they had so many Awards but just couldn't figure it out. My girlfriend and I are almost positive the taste of pad Thai was made with Ketchup sauce straight from the bottle. The pineapple rice was alright. Nothing inedible or tasted horrible but just didn't find it that special. Just normal.  Service was fast and staff were friendly. But not sure I would come here again for the price. Think I might rather visit Thai Express instead next time if I am craving pad Thai pad Thai."}
{"text":"This is one of my most favorite south Asia restaurant in town.  Great food and excellent service!  I love their soft shell crab, steak and pineapple fried rice!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here before and had a good experience.  This time was very disappointing. We asked for a stir fry shrimp dish but got deep fried and breaded shrimp with no veggies at all in the dish. The honey garlic ribs looked and tasted as though they had been cooked the day before and reheated as they were so tough and dried out. The fish dish also came deep fried with lots of batter and very little fish inside.  Soup and rice were very good. Not worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Saturday night . . . this tiny restaurant is a revolving door of patrons as one by one, tables were cleared and within minutes had new customers to fill them! We had a table right by the door, which at first I thought 'grrr' but was actually better as navigating your way through the restraint seemed precarious. Staff was a hilarious mix of sweet and attentive, and down-to-buiness wipe-that-grin-off-your-face efficiency. For three people, we ordered: Appetizer platter: I only had the spring roll which was delicious, my husband said the sugar cane shrimp was also good. Pad Thai: decent with a nice freshness Green curry: didn't try it myself but is a friends favourite.  Crispy Thai Beef - OMG so good I am only sorry the leftovers were sent home to my brother. Jasmine rice: as you would expect it All in all decent and I would return to try some other tasty things on the menu! Also loved the mix of people in the restaurant itself."}
{"text":"Love this place, this restaurant made me like Pad Thai !  They make it here with curry; chicken and shrimp is the favourite, so delicious. It only gets better if you eat in and ask for the fresh chillies on the side.  The other great but expensive dish is the Drunken Crab, -remember- ask for the market price before ordering it is not cheap. Rating 4 stars : Full Belly."}
{"text":"Driven by a deep desire for spicy thom yum soup to magically heal my sore throat, I stepped outside my warm home wearing a tank top on a breezy spring day not so long ago.   I ordered my soup and dumplings. The one thing that struck me was how limited to noodles their menu is! Ok, the lunch special menu does list a non-noodle dishes, but I was taken aback. Maybe the dinner menu lists all the menus.  The meal was delicious and the service was very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Great food! We come here regularly. Pho is so good and the chicken cashew is amazing. Don't know why others have bad experiences with this restaurant, it is amazing! Love it. Usually very busy at night and the service is decent.   Would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Been here two times now and love the fresh Thai food. Friendly and attentive hosts and severs. Casual with an upscale Ambiance. People coming and going to pick up their take out.  Also available through Just eat. Yummy! You won't be disappointed. Only one comment is Chicken Pad Thai is little too saucy and sweet but hey maybe that's your thing."}
{"text":"Try the social crispy beef. It's to die for.  Shanghai noodles are satisfactory but I've had better.  All in all this place is pretty perfect if you're just looking for a good selection of Asian food"}
{"text":"This is your typical, North American-ized restaurant's take on Asian cuisine. This \"Meh. I've experienced better\" rating couldn't be more a propos. The food was average, the service was less so. Mango juice was good, though!"}
{"text":"I took a new part-time job in the area and decided to try this restaurant before my shift one day.  My boyfriend and I peeked in through the large window in front - the tables are nicely decorated with tableclothes and wineglasses. While there wasn't a single person sitting inside, this seemed to be a hot spot for take-out on a Thursday night. The staff even knew the customers by name!  The owners are friendly but one of the waiters, although his intentions are friendly, will awkwardly stare at you eating. It makes it uncomfortable when you are the only customers in the restaurant.   We had two glasses of pinot grigio ($18) and the 'zen platter' ($15) to start. The large plate of mixed appetizers hit the spot and perhaps was a bit too filling! There were two types of deep fried rolls, and the fresh rolls came with a tasty peanut sauce, which would have been more impressive if it was made from scratch. The mango salad, passable, and a bit too raw.   For our mains, I choose the vegetarian laksa. The menu stated that the broth was vegetable-based (this is a huge relief as we can refrain from peppering the staff with annoying questions and scrutinizing sniffs when the food comes). For a vegetarian version, it wasn't too bad, although I wouldn't have pinned it down as a laksa. Mind you, I've had the real thing in Malaysia, with shrimps and all. The closest veg version I've had in Toronto is at the large Buddhist temple in Mississauga.  For our second main, we ordered a basil and cashew eggplant dish. There were quite a lot of cashews and the eggplant, although nicely fried and not overly greasy, could have had a little more seasoning on it. The purple rice, unfortunately, wasn't included with any of the orders.  PRO: If you want something gluten-free, they have plenty of choices. Meat or vegetarian! Prices vary between dishes, so you can order something for $10 or $20.  CON: Dishes are tasty but don't have the flair that the reputation of this neighbourhood normally promises.   I'd still come back, considering that the atmosphere is nice, there are lots of vegetarian/vegan choices and it could please a large crowd of both varying tastes and budgets. Likely, Lemongrass wouldn't be my first choice though.  3.5/5 stars"}
{"text":"I've only tried the chicken pad thai, but it was very disappointing.  The chicken itself was questionable, and the sauce is far from authentic.  Spicy Thai House on Mt Pleasant between Davisville and Belize has a much better chicken pad thai."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years, as it's near where I work.  Can't understand the average 3 star rating. Place is always top notch and the prices are totally reasonable.  It's your typical selection of Asian dishes...mostly Thai, but some Vietnamese etc...quality is always way better than what you'll find at similar places and the service is always very good.  I'm not sure what people could complain about.  I've been here at least 30 or 40 times over the years and have never had a bad experience ."}
{"text":"I was hesitant about coming here after reading the not so great reviews but a friend of mine insisted this place would be the best place in the area to have dinner. She's a vegetarian and I can definitely see how she'd enjoy their food as there were multiple true veggie options. The restaurant is really long and thin and was quite busy on a weekday night but we were seated fairly fast. I ordered the chicken pad thai and my friend opted for the stir-fried chili tofu. I preferred my friend's tofu over my pad thai as hers was really flavourful while mine was bland and watery. I found the pad thai sauce to be the most unpleasant part of the dish as it was basically ketchup. On the positive side, the portions were large but I didn't think the prices were justified for the meal we had."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times now but it seems to be going down in quality over the last few years. They seem to have turned it around a little and it's still the best Thai food in the area. They do 10% for pickup cash costumers. Isn't that illegal? They are obviously trying to avoid Uncle Sam. The service depends whether the owner is there."}
{"text":"Lemon gross. Three out of four in our party felt unwell immediately after eating here. Food was expensive but poor quality. Much better Thai places in the city."}
{"text":"Well, where should I start!   I ordered delivery with very simple instructions. Food came with wrong sauces. No big deal. I called the restaurant to see if they had received the additional instructions, (which they did) and a man began screaming at me.. actually screaming.. and said I was wrong, and that was the correct sauce. I reminded him that I live in the community and have eaten there many times before, and when I've asked for peanut sauce before, I was given peanut sauce. He then screamed that he didn't care and hung up.   Disappointed by the complete lack of care from start to finish. I cannot support businesses who have abusive workers/ owners. Ever.  Good luck."}
{"text":"Come here quite regularly and find the service always excellent. I like their pad Thai and Spring rolls, my sister loves the lemongrass soup. My son really likes the chicken satay. They are soo accommodating and always make suggestions:-)) It's a nice relaxed family atmosphere where I know my 5 year old is welcome:-)))"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, big portion and delicious food. Comfortable seats. My friend and I were enjoying lounge music with Thai style drinks. Don't understand why they got 3 stars from other reviews."}
{"text":"Unbelievable- I just paid $45 for two dishes both of which arrived cold and the quality of the food is something you'd get at a food court. Just terrible, the chicken looks plastic and tastes like paper - I called the restaurant to ask for a refund since nothing has more than one bite from it. The woman was extremely rude and basically told me 'too bad enjoy'"}
{"text":"Lots of vegetarian options and great service! Love their selection of vegetarian soup noddles, and their vegetarian curry. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be our Thai resto of choice years ago.  Thought we go back.  Suspected things had changed when we walked in and the place was pretty empty on a Saturday night. Used to be the place was packed. Service is great but sadly food has gone downhill.  Shrimp in pad thai and rice dishes gave gone from tiger shrimps to salad sized tiny ones which were not fresh. Mild chicken curry had no kick at all and potatoes or whatever was in the curry was dry and old.  The basil beef and halibut dishes were tasty.  Have a feeling there are either new owners or new chef since we were last there."}
