{"text":"A few blocks off of I-57, the Red Wheel Restaurant has a large sign out front that advertise \"PANCAKES! STEAKS!\" with equal enthusiasm. The interior is definitely dated, but that's ok, because on the Sunday brunch/lunch time we were there, the average age of the clientele was about 75. :-)  But everyone seemed happy -- people stopping and chatting to other tables of patrons, and many tables of what was very obviously \"regulars\". The serving staff was busy, but extremely good -- no water glass was ever emptied, she checked back frequently but discreetly to make sure we were take care of, and the food arrived within minutes.  My husband had a hamburger platter with french fries, and pronounced it very tasty. I had a short stack of pancakes (not really fluffy, but still good, and HUGE), and what turned out to be a generous side order of bacon. We were in and out in less than 40 minutes.  It has it's own kitschy ambiance, but it was clean as a whistle.  Definitely a repeat if we're in the area again."}
{"text":"The reviews made me nervous, but we ate here anyway because we were hungry and didn't want fast food.  It's nothing fancy, but overall the food was decent.  Our waitress was attentive.  Plus it didn't take long to get our food.  Overall I was glad we decided to take a chance."}
{"text":"Was on a bit of road trip and stopped here on the fly, yes it's a little tacky but we got a good amount of food for a good price and the waitress, arryn, I think was her name was great! Meals came with soup or salad and house made bread which isn't something I expect from a diner like place. I would recommend and go again."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero starts but I'll give it one because I have to and the waitress was polite at least.   This place feels and looks like it hasn't been deep cleaned since the 70s, which I'm pretty sure is when all the food was made. It's terrible, depressing, old. The food was old school, and bland, and tasted like all the ingredients came from a giant tub bought at GFS (Gordon Food Services). This place is a throw back in the worst way. Like I said, the waitress was nice, but even she had this look of utter disappointment and despair. Oy.  This further confirms my belief that any restaurant that has a 10+ page menu can't be good, because everything must be frozen in order to have ingredients for that many dishes."}
{"text":"HAHA.. we had  Aryn as our server, and you didn't!! She told us about the specials.. Soups..  We both had the AYCE walleye,  baked potato and green beans. Generous portion of fish!! Aryn brought us a small plate of the shrimp,  because you can do that with the AYCE walleye, perch or shrimp.  Lots of food for under $10 a person..  However, I took 1 star off for  the salad, because it tasted like it was frozen... Dumplings in the soup were very different from what I'm  used to....."}
{"text":"The Red Wheel is a near the high way diner.  No frills, nothing fancy, but hey, 'twas enjoyable.  I won't say the food was epic, but it got the job done, and the server was super awesome and she kept her cool despite a few random incidents, such as a suicidal ranch container that chose to cover her from near head-to-toe in ranch.  That said, IF you're in Rantoul, why not stop by?  It's hardly a draw otherwise, but I was intrigued by any restaurant that would have a marquis that bellowed PANCAKES//STEAKS!  What a combination.  It's like Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles had a strange cousin."}
{"text":"Aryn was awesome! The chicken was piping hot and huge! If I didn't live in Houston I'd be back!!  Seriously Aryn should be commended for her sparkling personality.  The place was perfect."}
{"text":"No taste with the hamburgers, too expensive for the quality of the food. Though very friendly staff. Don't care for the french fries, need to have options. Vegetables taste like a tin can, need to have frozen ones. Need to have a buffet option and better steaks. Tacos and some Mexican food options. I think that they could make a lot of money if they became buffet style."}
{"text":"I love this place because its a HOME TOWN place. people who post crap because it needs updates obviously don't live here in town and enjoy the atmosphere. This place is great for family gatherings. the menu is fantastic. I love the waffles, and the staff is great. Reminds me of a favorite restaurant when I was a child."}
{"text":"Being a lifelong resident of Rantoul I might be  considered biased but \"The Wheel\" has always been a favorite of mine and my family's.   The breakfasts are always a hit and the AYCE fish is a must if you like fish or shrimp. My fav is the chopped steak and eggs with Country Bob's on the side. The omelettes are very good and the turkey club is very filling.   The servers are very good, some are like family.  The only reason it wasn't a 5 star was the bathroom, which has been a long running joke these last several years amongst my friends and family, but they have been improved somewhat."}
{"text":"Food was average. The stuff was polite but our waitress was not very attentive. The prices we reasonable and portions were large."}
{"text":"I Allway enjoy going to the red wheel ,Great service, The waitress Allway Great services."}
{"text":"In desperate need of a makeover. Has that \"nursing home feel\" every time you walk in. Definitely not my first choice of dining to go to in town. Have had much better food and much better service elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food was bad. The place was dirty. Sticky tables. Just disappointing overall. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I only are here once and not by my choice.   The venue was not clean 'feeling' and food all tasted like it was heat and serve--- my main complaint is with the owners recent business tactic that stifled the opening of a competitor on the east side of Rantoul.  If this place was so 'great' why worry if some one open an eatery 2 Miles down the road?? 2"}
{"text":"Experience here was alright.  I stopped by on a Sunday afternoon driving back to Chicagoland from Southern Indiana-land.  The place itself is pretty big, and they had quite a few customers there even though it was not peak dining time.  It's your typical \"been around since my grandparents\" type of diner, with generous portions, and decor that probably hasn't changed in a long while.  The food looked good, I tried the beef stroganoff which comes with fried mashed potatoes.  I think I was more interested in the concept of fried mashed potatoes than the beef stroganoff itself, but I found both to be decent.  Good portions and fairly flavorful.  It's not a place I'd go out of my way for, but it was pretty conveniently located right off I-57.  If you're looking for decent and decently priced diner food, this is your place."}
{"text":"I no longer go to red wheel be as every time I go the food is terrible, the place is run down looking and the staff is rude. The owner is also a terrible business owner, stifling competition in a town desperately in need of choices. I will never come here again. The food alone is reason enough but the attitude of the establishment is the nail in the coffin for me. Never again."}
{"text":"What can you say about this place.  It is a casual diner that has been there forever. We had breakfast here at super cheap prices, decent coffee, and a friendly waitress who knew every other customer in the restaurant.    The only disappointing item was the \"homemade\" corned beef hash. It was clearly not homemade. Not that there is anything wrong with that in my opinion. I know most people cannot stand the thought of hash, but I have a special place in my heart for it, even if it is canned.  If you are hungry, find yourself in Rantoul, and don't want fast food, the Red Wheel is a great option."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. I had the tenderloin Manhattan and the gravy was straight out of a bottle and the tenderloin was fried until it was really dry."}
{"text":"The food was probably 2 stars. The service was 3. She was polite and did her job. The atmosphere was a 0. The cleanliness was a -1. The situation in the ladies room was a -50. I still feel nauseous when I think about it.   First, everything was sticky. The tables, the chairs, the menus. The menu was far too long and convinced me that there was no way that anything could be fresh, save for the wonder bread (because everything comes with toast). I had french toast. It was okay, not horrific. I've definitely had worse food in \"nice\" restaurants (see my list of dining disasters http://www.yelp.com/list/dining-disasters-milwaukee). One member of our group had a chicken sandwich and had major complaints about quality and taste (the bread itself was totally drenched and there was no sauce on the sandwich...).   Overall the incredible dirtiness of this place and the lack of fresh or nutritious food deems this place the lowest possible score."}
{"text":"Three stars only because of the service. The food was mediocre at best. I had a NY Strip Steak with fried shrimp. Ordered it medium rare and got medium. Little to no flavor and tough. I used steak sauce just to get some flavor(something I loathe to do). My daughter-in-law had the chopped steak with mushrooms. Chopped Steak was dry and tasteless. The mushrooms were obviously from a can. One grandson had the kids hotdog and the by was a toasted French roll. And he said the bun was very hard. The other grandkids had grilled cheese sandwiches. They were okay. My wife had the breaded pork cutlets. They were also pre made items. Overall the food was subpar at best. The restaurant was clean and the staff is what makes this a 3 star review."}
{"text":"Turn the corner off interstate 57 in rural Illinois. You are surrounded by corn fields on three sides and your typical fast food chains and gas station wall you in. Like an oasis in a restaurant desert Red Wheel Restaurant beckons the weary traveler to its almost vacant parking lot.  Aside from the obvious jokes delirious road warriors can make about the name \"Red Wheel\" the place hits the spot for under $40 for a family of four.  The child's popcorn shrimp platter is more than enough to feed any child or three. The fried goodies were delicious and neither one of my picky underage travelers complained.  The man got the Stromboli which is just a pizza chimichanga and just as tasty as one could imagine a tortilla wrapped, pan fried pizza to be.  The woman (me) got a big slab of ribeye. Dead cow. What more could I ask for while riding the red wheel."}
