{"text":"Beer selection is on point, burgers are very impressive. Wife loves the cocktails here. Wait time is Short, I would recommend."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat. The food was terrific  and the service Great! If you have food allergies, they will accommodate you. Take a risk and eat at Copper Still Moonshine Grill."}
{"text":"I am new to the Gilbert area, and found this place on Yelp. The staff was super friendly and the food much better than the typical bar food. The shrimp tacos and the burgers are delicious.  This may become my new \"local!\""}
{"text":"Melissa O. was right! The mac and cheese is homemade and delicious, and the grilled wings are equally as tasty!! The beer is ice cold as well! Give this place a try...you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Moonshine Grill.  When we arrived the owner seated us and informed us that kids eat free on Tuesday, which was great since we had 2 with us.  The owner was very nice and checked on our table a few times. We ordered the cheese sauce and the guacamole for an appetizer.  The cheese sauce was very runny so I didn't really like it much.  My husband said the guacamole was pretty good. For lunch I had the grilled cheese hamburger and it was soooo good, my husband had a bite and also loved it! I was disappointed with the sweet potato fries because they were so soggy. Our daughter got the waffle fries and chicken tenders, she really liked the waffle fries. I would definitely give this place another try, especially to have the grilled cheese burger again."}
{"text":"All in all, a good place! Burger was good, chips and quac was good, the garlic fries were good. Good looking bar. Go check it out! Went with my sister and she asks for everything in a very particular way, and they had no issues catering to her specificity."}
{"text":"This place is on my way home and has mixed reviews so I decided to check it out for myself.  On a Thursday around 4:30, the place was pretty empty and I was able to sit wherever I wanted.  The local beer I ordered arrived qickly and it was $5 for a tall which is a little less than I've paid at places in downtown Chandler for the equivalent size.

Some of the food on the menu sounded gourmet so I had difficulty deciding what to eat. I decided on a grilled cheese with tomato, bacon, and avocado. The sandwich was ok, but certainly not gourmet because it was generic white bread with a slice of American cheese. I paid an upcharge to try the garlic fries which were good, but the crumbled bacon on them tasted fake. They would be better without the bacon which is disappointing because I am a bacon aficionado. 

The service was fine. My final bill with a tall and small local beer, sandwich, and garlic fries was $21. Not bad.

I may go back, but the place did not have enough appeal to make it a new happy hour destination."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing ambiance and the staff is wonderful. We loved the happy hour menu which offers drinks that would be hard to find collectively in the east valley. Great food too!"}
{"text":"Went Wednesday before Thanksgiving, nice place, the \"b & g\" wings are awesome, their take on \"baked and grilled\". Hummus was served with warm pita chips, very good! Wifi present, nice tv's, music not excessively loud, small but decent patio, will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time last evening, left with mixed impressions.  We went before the dinner rush so it wasn't real busy.  The service was great -- attentive, timely without rushing or making us wait.  Food was mixed.  I had the pulled pork and it was excellent.  The pork was smoked, not just simmered, and the sauce was great.  Others had burgers that were above average.  We split an order of garlic fires and were disappointed.  They had a garlic flavor but no garlic.  They are supposed to have bacon crumbles and we had to search to the bottom of the plate to find 3.  Not worth the $2.50 up charge for a side dish.  Draft beers were local with a nice selection.  All in all, it was ok (but a little pricey for a sports bar) and I'll try it again...maybe."}
{"text":"Hands down best bar in Gilbert. Great food, great owners & great drinks. Specials on a Friday night? Only at Copper Still!"}
{"text":"I've seen this place for quite awhile but never tried it. Early on in their opening I saw a negative review or two so never put it on my radar. We decided to try it for ourselves last night and are very glad we did. The setting is sports bar/garage/warehouse mixture. I've heard it called \"industrial\". The place is clean, good furniture etc. The staff, very friendly and attentive.
The food: Selection - standard pub style fare - burgers, sandwiches, salads, pizzas, a few entrees. Prices - very reasonable. Portion Size - very good - we were full. Quality - Very good.
I had the Phoenix Steak Sandwich which is a variation of the Philly Cheesteak only with a Southwest rub . Delicious - it was seasoned well and cooked well with a touch of heat but not mouth burning. My wife had the french onion grilled cheese sandwich - she said it was excellent and my son had the mac&cheese with bacon. I THINK if you order mac&cheese from the kids menu it is the standard Kraft out of the box kind. I let him order from the adult menu and it was penne pasta in a 3 cheese sauce breaded on top and baked. He loved it.
This was out first visit but definitely not the last."}
{"text":"This place opened a few months ago, so we decided to try it. We were there on a Tuesday night and they were full, but not on a wait. The waitress we had was very cocky, chewing gum and just unfriendly. Our good order came quickly, in fact our drinks didn't come for 15 minutes after our food. The turkey sandwich I ordered was terrible. I ordered another drink, but the waitress never brought it. The longer we sat there, the more frustrated I got. A different waitress cleared our table and I asked her for our check. Waited another 10 mins before I got up and found a manager, explained to him our circumstance, he said 'she's busy in the bar'. We were there for hour and 45 mins.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon about to expire, so we went here one Friday around 5:30. Not a big fan of going out Friday nights, since it can be too noisy and crowded, but we got a booth right away. The place was a little noisy, 1 big room instead of a separate bar and the NFL draft was going on...I don't get the hype in that, but whatever...We love to order local beer, and they had a full line of Four Peaks and San Tan on tap, a plus. Our waiter Skyler was pleasant and helpful without being in our faces. We ordered Scorpion burger & fries and a grilled cheeseburger. Mine was done to perfection, hubby said the scorpion burger was a little over-done. We both loved the scorpion fries and I want to try making them at home! In all, I think we would come back here if we are in the area (live in Tempe, so a little hike), even without a Groupon. The prices are reasonable and the Happy Hour specials look like a good deal!"}
{"text":"The owner walks the dining area and bar. A very nice staff that seemed to care about you as a patron. I enjoy going to the location. The quesadilla is my favorite menu item."}
{"text":"We made reservations and had a large party of 25 people. It was all set up and ready when we walked in. The waitress was great and kept all the  orders straight. The food was great. The manager came over and thanked us all for coming in. He brought over a big plate of dessert nachos for us all to share for the birthday boy."}
{"text":"We normally like coming here, but today was terrible. The food was bad and the service was horrible. Not sure if we Will give it another try after today."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch time for us, if you love grilled cheese and French onion soup, try French onion grilled cheese! Yum. Onion rings, garlic fries delish as well. Nice servers. Nice atmosphere, lots of big televisions. Neighborhood kind of place. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time about 5 weeks ago.  Staff was extremely friendly, service was great and food was above average.  Most importantly the beer was ice cold!   Not very often you get a beer served in a glass and it stays chilled till the last drop."}
{"text":"Our Favorite neighborhood restaurant recently  closed and we have been looking for a new \"favorite\" place and we found it when we came here. Honestly, when I read the reviews I was skeptical that a bar could have food that was that good, I wasn't expecting anything great.  We walked in and Shannon was our server.  She was very helpful and friendly and recommended a few things.  We took her advise and ordered the cheeseburger and the chicken tacos; they were amazing.  We had the hummus for an appetizer and it too was great. Recommend this place to anyone looking for a friendly great place to eat and drink"}
{"text":"Plain and simple, good food.  Deserts are good, milkshakes are good and the wings are good. All around good place to eat and go to dinner at."}
{"text":"This place is nothing to write home about.  My husband walked in and was greeted politely.  He asked for a water, was given a menu, and then went to the restroom.  After that he was never spoken to again. I came a few minutes later and had to ask for a menu.  My husband and I perused the menu and finally decided on what we wanted, however, no one ever came to take our order.  I made eye contact with the waitress several times and was never asked if we were ready to order.   We left without ordering anything.  My husband decided to leave the waitress $2 for the water.  I was totally against leaving anything.  We won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"went to this restaurant after having purchased a certificate from living social,had eaten there before several months ago,remember the food as being good and it still is,ate a mushroom/swiss burger with onion rings(ok but not the best)daughter had a cheeseburger from the kids menu with fries(very good fries crispy but not burnt) my only complaint is there do not serve a \"regular\"iced tea,some flavored stuff,so had to get a soda(guess i wasn't made to order it) so other than that,had very good service from the waitress"}
{"text":"Decent food. Ok prices and great service! Will try again as other menu items sounded like they could be really good. Fun sports bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"This would be a Great place to bring friends. Great place. Good food. Coming back. Had black beans salad & pulled pork sandwich."}
{"text":"Came here based on previous great reviews and it didn't disappoint. Garlic fries were awesome! Very crispy and flavorful.  I got the steak Phoenix sandwich- great sandwich with a spicy mayo, the roll they served it on was perfect. My hubby got the scorpion burger and he loved it.  Food was delicious and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so bad!  But it was a complete let down.  We went in yesterday to try it out.  The food was ok- nothing spectacular.  We tried fried and grilled wings.  The fried ones were dry/over cooked and small, the grilled were brunt black.  Total disappointment.  Our  server disappeared most of the night, we had to keep waiving down other ones to help us out.  Asked for water that came 25 mins later (from another server), my friend never got any."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on yelp after reading the reviews. We were not disappointed! Everything was delicious! Our waiter did make a mistake and forget our pretzels, so they got them out with our meal and comped them  The only drawback was it was kinda loud. But we will come back when we are in town!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food is above standards, love the Jalapeno Boats (poppers), meat is top notch bbq, really awesome staff and owners. A must try. Oh and best yet, sports are always on!

This place does feel like home!"}
{"text":"My husband & I came here for dinner on a Saturday evening. We were seated at a booth as soon as we walked in. We ordered drinks. Then I had their specialty, the grilled cheese burger. It was unlike anything I've ever had before. There was no bun, it was buttered bread made just like grilled cheese, except there was a burger inside. Quite yummy & I would definitely recommend it. My husband had a bacon cheese burger the he liked. Said it was not great. The fries were really good. It was quite, quite loud due to a party in the bar area. But, it was a Saturday night & the place was good, so we could expect a lot of people. There & try it! The service was good too!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple weeks ago for the first time and I love the grilled wings and the service :) they have several TV'S playing all the various NFL football games and some great HH specials... will be back!"}
{"text":"Well I have to start by saying I've never reviewed any type of business on any of the Internet review sites. I have however eaten at restaurants all over the valley for the last 28 years. I have been to copper still 4 or 5 times each time I've left satisfied and happy with my experience. Tonight I was with my 10 year old nephew after a basketball game and we had an unbelievable experience. There was a woman at a table near us that I watched throw her food,yell obscenities at the staff,and make a complete fool of herself and her young daughter.I watched the manager try to make this women happy and even offered to comp. both of their meals,she went nuts and threw the daughters food on the table. My nephew received his Mac and cheese at the same time this women's daughter received her  dinner (same Mac and cheese)  my nephew enjoyed his so I almost have to believe this lady was looking for a fight. I tried his dinner just to make sure it was ok and it tasted great to me. One last thing I have to say I own my own company and deal with customers every day. The manager of this establishment gave a great effort trying to defuse a person that appeared miserable way before she decided to go out to eat. Last thing I'll add is this woman yelled to the entire restaurant as she was leaving that \"she was going to bury this place with bad reviews\"  I often read reviews of places I'm thinking of going to try to get different opinions of quality and service. You can almost tell sometimes when people are out of their minds. This review seemed competent, if I hadn't witnessed this myself I wouldn't be writing this. Take my opinion serious and realize that some people wake up miserable and go to bed miserable. This women from the looks of it is one of them. I'll continue to go to Copper Still as will my friends and family. By the way the company I own is a landscape company and we are moving 22 tons of gravel in the morning........we can always use another person to help shovel rock and ......BURY...... Sprinkler lines"}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Ordered chix sliders & there was no avocado of pepper jack cheese, which is supposed to come with it. Most of my onion rings had the dry, stringy, outside layer of the onion. We ordered take out & was told it'd be ready in 10-15 mins. When my hubby arrived was told it'd be another 5 mins but he waited an additional 15. After he walked out the door he noticed he didn't get the chili he ordered. A guy then came out with the chili but when we got home the cup was less than half full. We used to love this place but it seems to be going downhill."}
{"text":"Discovered this restaurant by mistake- kind of hard to see from the road.
We had a delightful dinner here. Service was excellent- Alexis was attentive and knowledgeable about her choices.  I had the chicken alfredo: Not too heavily sauced as some are, lovely garlic and great taste. Hubby had BAT grilled cheese and tomato basil soup.  He says both were great. (However ,I can't vouch for accuracy of that review)
The house chardonnay was decent. I am not a fan of the mini carafe to pour wine out of though.  Restaurant got a tad noisy, but  All in all a very good experience.  I took 2 friends back there today for lunch.  I had the half turkey sandwich and  latticed fries. Very yummy. The bread was heavily buttered before grilling- perhaps a tad overwhelming, 
I tried the fish and chips off a plate- batter a bit limp but great taste on the batter and  fish. Again, we got great service.  We were offered separate checks with a smile.  This restaurant is on my \"let's go back there \" list."}
{"text":"Went there today with my family.  There was about 10 of us.  We were greeted and seated very quickly.   Service was very good.  Never had an empty glass.   We were not only waited on by our server, but by any server walking by, asking if we  needed anything.  Food was above average bar food.   Kids had a great time there.  Will definitely  go back."}
{"text":"Service was good but food was lacking, ordered nachos, what a joke!! Melted cheddar cheese, dried up chicken, I could of done a better job at home. Not restaurant quality at all, don't think I'll be back"}
{"text":"We split the Hot B&G Wings and the Scorpion Burger with Garlic Fries. The wings are delicious and have some kick to them. They have an awesome grilled flavor. The burger had great flavor and it's definitely worth upgrading to the garlic fries. The service was great!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed.

They were not busy, there were only 8 other customers in the restaurant. There were more workers than guests!

I had to ask for menus and it took 10 minutes just to get our drinks (beer).  The staff did not pay attention to us. They were either hanging out in groups talking or in the back. I had to chase down the manager to get another beer because all the servers were in the back for so long. 

When the food came out, it had tomato on it even though I said I'm allergic to tomato. I could have used another drink while I was eating but nobody bothered to come by.

When it was time to pay, I had to go into the kitchen to find someone because I was tired of waiting for someone to come and help us.

This place needs serious help or it will be out of business soon."}
{"text":"I first want to point out that our service was excellent. We were seated immediately even though it was relatively busy on a Friday night. Our server was Michelle, who brought our drinks almost freakishly fast and kept them full. Our food came quickly.

The food was great. Not amazing-fantastic-wow-best thing I've ever eaten, but great. We shared garlic fries to start, and though I was initially surprised at just how garlicky they were (which is very garlicky!) they were delicious and we made quick work of that plate. My husband got the mac-n-cheese with bacon. It was very good but more cheese would have made it creamier, which is never bad. I had the popper -- grilled cheese sandwich with jalapeno, cream cheese, and bacon. Awesome flavors but the cream cheese and jalapeno were only in one part of the sandwich, so it wasn't very balanced. 

We had a Living Social deal which made this visit more than worth it. There was a lot of good sounding stuff on the menu so I'd really like to go back!"}
{"text":"This is our second time here and the food has been great both times. Salads are fresh, wings are great and sandwiches are yummy. I'll be back. Wish it was closer but it's a great place after golf. They have a great lunch special. The turkey sandwich is really good. Lots of tv's for the sports minded people. Servers are friendly. I hope more people try it and keep it open. Not sure how weekends are but weekdays it's not too busy."}
{"text":"We love coming to this place and have always had a great experience. However tonight we had an even better experience when the owner went above and beyond on something that was not correct with our order."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are great!  I love the golden wings and the copper mule is awesome.  I've been there about 5 times because it's such a convenient location for my friends and I to meet at and every time I've had a terrible experience with the staff.  I wouldn't say that myself or even any of my friends are high maintenance but I mean seriously, that staff is either completely unfriendly or way too friendly to the point where she made us all feel uncomfortable (with a really odd laugh).  We end up at Teakwoods, in the same plaza, all the time because we cannot stand the service at Copper Still but yes, the food is good.  I wish there was a drive-thru!"}
{"text":"Come here a lot of Friday nights for trivia - mainly had snack-ish foods, but planning to have dinner there this weekend.
Boneless wings and hummus have been excellent, as have the chicken nachos.
Hefeweizen is very good.
They have something on the menu I'm dying to try - French Onion Grilled Cheese!  

Always good service, clean, and it doesn't hurt that our team often wins trivia ;)"}
{"text":"Carter was a sweetie and made us feel right at home.  The grilled cheese were interesting and we tried three different ones.  Loved the out door seating area.  Two local beers."}
{"text":"Awesome Patio! Likely one of the best in the Ahwatukee area. Why? Virtually non-smoking with 2/3 of the tables dedicated to non and the remaining 1/3 smoking. The reason this really works is the ingenious patio design (see photo). 1.) The patio ceiling is totally louvered, which allows the sun angle to be shifted and airflow optimized. 2.) They have fan powered misters (versus drip) that really keeps the circulation moving and the air cool and fresh. 3.) The last cleaver touch, are oscillating fans mounted from a bar/rod near the ceiling, strategically located between smoking and non smoking tables that pushes the air away from the center of the patio and towards the perimeter. CSMG has a very thoughtful outdoor space design, unlike many Ahwatukee restaurant patios that are rendered virtually useless because they are simply uninhabitable denizens due to the overwhelming smoke. At CSMG, you would not hesitate to take your children onto the patio. Tons of televisions and super clean. Oh, the patio is dog friendly too. Lastly, they have a garage door that separates the main dining area from the patio area which rolls up; this really provides a connectiveness to the restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! Lots of appetizers and a huge menu. We love the chicken sliders. Nachos are really delicious, too. We did the chip and dip recently and the guacamole tasted very bland. No salt or flavor at all, except huge chunks of red onion. Previously when we'd gotten it it was really good so whoever made it must not have known how because it was totally flavorless. The salsa was good though. The Caesar salad I had as a side was just ok. I wouldn't order it again. We always have had great service here and never have had to wait for a seat! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great burger! The queso burger was excellent and my wife claims that these are the BEST garlic fries she's ever had. I'm not a garlic fry expert but that is pretty high praise from her. The regular fries with ranch were very good. 

I do have to say that my son did not enjoy his grilled cheese from the kids menu. It was obviously a processed cheese. I ate some, it was actually pretty good, I think the kid is just spoiled since we normally cook with some high grade cheeses. Kids!

The environment is very nice, clean with good service. The restrooms were clean. 

All in all a very nice lunch. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Very high quality first experience. I had the steak sliders and they were ridiculously delicious. Ask for extra horseradish. Service was prompt and professional. Nice big open bar and grill type place that would be a fun place to watch a game."}
{"text":"UPDATE:
----------
Went back for the 2nd day in a row (that good!).  Had the smoked pork spiders and onion rings.  Again food was delicious.  Enough to bump from a 4 to a 5.  Wait was very reasonable for a Friday night too.  Definitely will be back.
-----------


Great food options!  Robust beer selection with wide variety of local brews.  Started with garlic fries---pretty good!  My wife and I both settled on the chicken sliders for a meal.  These were D-licious!! Chicken, bacon, spicy mayo, and avocado--hard to screw that up.  I had the cole slaw for my side.  It was your average cole slaw...I wished they would have jazzed it up a bit.  

The menu was HUGE.  We will definitely be back to try out some other menu items.  Good food and service!!"}
{"text":"I've never heard of this place but I stopped in on the way home from work for a quick happy hour cocktail.  Thanks Yelp!  I walked in and everyone was seated at the bar.  The entire restaurant area was entire.  There were about 4 available seats at the bar.  Despite noticing that every single person at the bar had a draft beer I still decided to go with a cocktail.  I can't remember the name of my drink but it was a Mule with orange bitters in it .. Something like a Whiskey Citrus Mule. It was only OK.  Not bad, not delicious but just OK.  I wanted to order something to snack on but I noticed no one had any food at all either.  The cooks were standing near the bar just chatting it up.  I totally understand. It was pretty dead.  So I skipped the food, order another cocktail.  I kept it simple and ordered a bourdon and tonic with lime.  I enjoyed that a lot better than my mule.  I probably wouldn't return for a second time."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Copper Still Moonshine Grill on May 23, 2018 for Happy Hour.  It's a very nice, clean place and the food is very good.  We enjoyed the people who work there because they are very nice and friendly.  They have Trivia there every Wednesday and they have a large crowd that comes for that.  We plan to make this place one of our favorite haunts!"}
{"text":"We only went for drinks, but the beer and cocktails were good, and staff were super friendly. I'll definitely go back! The moonshine margarita was really good, and so was the kilt lifter."}
{"text":"Great menu, good service and nice atmosphere. Will be back. No problem redeeming my entertainment book coupon."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here last Friday. Hostess greeted us at the door and found us a table near the bar. Our server came over right away and informed us we were still in hh and to check out the hh menu. Ordered a bloody mary and a peach moonshine drink served in mason jars and were so good! Ordered the queso/guacamole dip with chips along with a bruschetta app. Both came out quick and tasted amazing! Our server was very friendly and attentive.  The owner stopped by to introduce himself and to thank us for checking the place out. We definitely left full and very happy!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and enjoyed ourselves every time.  Not only is the food good but the drinks are made with an acceptable amount of alcohol, unlike too many of the independent bars around here.
The one problem I have for this place and the reason I didn't give it the 4th star, twice I've gone in and ordered the steak sliders and they've been out of them.  I can understand running out one time, especially when you've just opened, but twice is too many, their kitchen manager needs to learn something about ordering what's needed."}
{"text":"I like this place! Love all the different combinations of drinks, so hard to choose! My favorite are the grilled cheese sandwiches with the crisp cut fries. Staff is friendly and attentive, food and drinks are great and the place has a great atmosphere. Very casual. Good local hangout!"}
{"text":"Loved it!!! From the decor to the service, food and overall atmosphere we were very pleased and impressed with Copper Still. 

We came in on one of their poker nights but they still had room to seat us, and we got awesome service despite all the potential distraction from the poker games going on behind us. Our drinks were great, and we loved the local whiskey they had on their menu. We waited about 15 mins for our food which was really quick in my opinion, and we loved the trivia cards on the table to pass the time. 

My wife loved her mushroom and Swiss burger, and I agree it was delicious. My cheesesteak was good as well, however it was a bit dry. The meat was super tender and flavorful and once a little mayo was added the sandwich was perfect! 
Overall we were very impressed with Copper Still and look forward to visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"I went here with some friends for lunch.  The place is small and nicely furnished.  What is real cool is the board that they have behind the bar.  You can buy people drinks and they write on the board what you bought them, who it is from and who it is to, pretty cool.  The service was good as well.  The young man that was waiting on us was very attentive and friendly.  Apparently it was only his first few days working there.  For being new, he did a great job which says a lot for whom ever trained him.  
As for the food, I had the boneless wings and pickle fries.  The nuggets were good, nothing special, seasoned and done well, pretty much like all the other \"boneless wings\" you get in bars.  The pickle fries were my favorite.  Cut to look like french fries and lightly breaded, they were great.  Most places give you the super thin slices or the giant wedges, they are either under breaded or way over breaded, these were just right.  One person had the pork tacos.  He said they were real good and that he would definitely get them again.  Also at the table were the hot dogs.  Wrapped in bacon and loaded up, I was told that these too were very good.  Finally, we also had the wings.  I forget what they are called but they were the ones that were baked and grilled, not deep fried.  She ordered that extra well done.  I would have done the same, however after trying them, I don't think the extra done is necessary.  She let me try one and they were good, however the char on the outside was a little bit to much.  I like a good char on my wings, but not quite that much, just a personal preference.  I would definitely go back and most likely will."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this restaurant.  Service was great; our waitress was very nice and made it a great experience.

We went on a Sunday around lunchtime and it wasn't too busy.  Service was fast.  They didn't have a certain alcohol that we asked for, and the bartender himself came to our table to offer other options.  I found that very impressive."}
{"text":"The food was good. But it was Friday and they were doing karaoke. It was horrible. Country music. Horrible.  I think they are confused about where we are located in the valley. This is not East mesa."}
{"text":"Went there to try it out as we had an Entertainment book coupon.  Our server was fantastic, friendly, positive, eager to please. She was attentive to make sure we had everything we needed.  She made a bloody mary that may have been the best ever. The garlic fries are awesome, covered with garlic and crispy, fresh potatoes. Even the bathrooms were nice. We would come back here the next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Same folks as in Gilbert. Although this place is a lot bigger. Same good service and good food. We really love (the Gilbert) CSMG because it is so close to our house. This one is a welcome addition.
Tip, B&G Wings, dry rub, side of honey Sriracha. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Great concept. well executed. awesome house drinks.  Kentucky Mules Rock! Ordered the sliders and the Parmesan fries. They were really good and the fries stayed hot till the very end because they were served on a cast-iron skillet!

The staff made us feel very welcome! And the service was top-notch. I stopped in for a quick bite and a drink before going to a play. But this would be an awesome place to catch a game! 

You have to put this place on your bucket list! I know that I will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"I've been here twice with a group and both times everyone,including myself, had delicious food! Food was fresh, flavorful and delicious. Bar food as well as sandwiches and flatbreads. Smells a little funky when you wak in but staff is friendly and attentive (both times we went in were pretty crowded). I didn't even notice this place until I saw it on Yelp and I am glad we tried it. Definitely will be coming in more often."}
{"text":"Great beer selection... Nice and quiet during day... Comes alive at night!"}
{"text":"Love the moonshine flights and unique moonshine flavors. If you are a moscow mule fan, try their take on it!  Their grilled wings are pretty good  as well.  I enjoy you can customize your mac and cheese and they have pretty awesome grilled cheeses.  Check it out for the moonshine at least."}
{"text":"4 Stars for good food- I agree with some reviews that this place is still trying to find its identity. 

I have been here twice so far and got the same thing both times- Grilled Cheese Cheeseburger and garlic fries- both times great! 

Service was decent but not anything to write home about. 

I wish I could have made it to their Brews Cruise but could not- hopefully they will do it more in the cooler months and have the price go down with a few less beers. 

Overall, I will be back! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"We were excited to see something new pop up in this location.  
The service was good and we felt all out needs meet quickly. 
 The food was good.  I had a salad done meat on it like a shaved beef very flavorful.  The wings however were the top item of our meal.  They were perfect crispness while the sauce was just enough without being overly saucy. I don't recall what hubby had but I know her really enjoyed it.
I even picked up a gift card for our anniversary coming up.  Looking forward to trying other menu items"}
{"text":"Wait staff was good but young-underage so could not answer questions about drink specials and didn't offer to find out.  They should at least understand the menu. No biggie there really since menu lists main ingredients in drinks....just sit at the bar if your going for happy hour.

TVs are playing sports but they don't interfere with the rest of the atmosphere.   Music playing softly in the background but doesn't drown out conversation. 

Food was awesome all around and reasonably priced.  I didn't care for my drink, though.....very bitter.  

Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Incredible for what it is.  I had a grill-cheese-burger and it was awesome.  They have a verity of beers, and if I remember correctly my date got a chicken wrap.  She raves about how good it was to this day.  I'd return."}
{"text":"We eat here alot, mostly mid week around 530.
We love the food, great variety on the menu and they always accommodate special requests. Service is the only thing we've ever complained about. 
Tonight, spot on. Young Man that served us, hustled. Cocktails came quickly, food as was delicious as usual and order was correct and hot. 
I think communication has improved with the staff, they seem to help each other which of course leads to better service. We tip well when happy, good job tonight!"}
{"text":"This is a great sports bar.  Multiple TVs are tuned into every available team.  During the football season, you can expect a crowd whenever there are college or NFL games around.  The food and drinks are good and reasonably priced and the service is great.  

The grill is in a very busy  strip mall and parking can be a problem."}
{"text":"This place is pretty close to me so I decided to go here on a hungry whim. I managed to hit happy hour and got some good food for pretty good prices. I can't rant or rave about the food being awesome or sub-par but it was good. Plenty good to return another time.

The service was pretty good too - server didn't pester me nor did they leave me in the dust. This seems like a pretty cool little neighborhood place to dine at."}
{"text":"New place but experienced owner. Amazing blue cheese burger with a side of wing hot sauce. Also have tried all the specialty drinks and you can't go wrong with any of them!"}
{"text":"Abby was a fantastic server! She was dedicated, knew the menu, and sold us the best happy hood special for what we were looking for. Her sunny disposition and honest, \"go-getter\" attitude touched the couple from \"Girls\". She worked her tush off. Thank you! 

As for Copper Still, this is a GREAT sports bar. Happy clientele and great food and specials. What more could you as for?"}
{"text":"Cool setting, friendly staff, locally owned and supports local brews. 
Different nightly specials, like \"Moonshine Mondays.\" and daily happy hours. 
Food is tasty and has a unique spin on traditional items like burgers, wings, etc. 
Will be a welcome addition to Gilbert."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a rare occasion of a night out and decided to try this local restaurant.  We absolutely loved it!  The food was amazing and the service was great!  I would definitely go back again and again!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice... after the first visit which was hit and miss, I gave it another try. I don't think it is good enough to go back for a third visit. I can't recommend this place, but if you do end up here this info might help you make the best of it:

The garlic fries & stuffed jalapeno peppers (\"boats\") rate pretty good.  I would recommend these, but watch out, they charge extra for the garlic fries as a side..  Hot wings and Grand Canyon burger were also pretty good -- not the best I've ever had, but quite edible. The Grand Canyon burger is pretty big so make sure you are hungry.  I'm sure their regular-ish (non-specialty) burgers would be the same as the Grand Canyon but smaller.  Just don't expect them to be cooked to order: I ordered med-rare and got medium-well to well done.  This is not surprising, most places can't cook a burger to order. I can't even do it at home most of the time.

The popper sandwich is very weak.  I'm not sure if it's execution or just one of those things that sounds better than it is in real life.  The scorpion burger is a joke. Not hot and taste like a burger with taco seasoning. They should call it a taco burger, but even then it doesn't taste very good so I wouldn't order it. The Italian flat bread was by far one of the worst things I have eaten in recent memory. It is doughy and flavorless... about on par with bagel bites... maybe worse.

The happy hour is not that great of a deal and the moonshine is way overpriced.  To be honest, I don't understand the recent hoopla around moonshine.  I don't know, maybe I just haven't had good moonshine. At any rate, this place (which does not make its own)  doesn't serve anything that special. It is not that strong, and it is not that good. You may as well go get yourself some flavored vodka or if you want something strong, some Everclear.

In short, if you go here, I would order wings or poppers as an app, the grand canyon burger with garlic fries if you are hungry and beer if you are going to drink."}
{"text":"Service was very slow. Restaurant was about 30% full. Food was ok. Tater tots were very--of course!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on Saturday. Had the pulled pork sandwich, cole slaw and tater tots for my side. The food and service were excellent. It's on the do over list for sure."}
{"text":"Moonshine heaven. The concoctions they come up with are fantastic. The food is pretty fab too and every table has these fun trivia cards on them you can play and make your friends realize what a genius you are at worthless knowledge. ; )"}
{"text":"The storefront to this restaurant isn't anything impressive and the non-bar seating is a little limited, but the classic American bar food and the twists that they put on it are great. The staff was friendly and the food was excellent. The staff was friendly and they have Trivial Pursuit cards at each table (I was pretty thankful they had some of the children's version cards or I wouldn't have answered any of the questions). It was fun quizzing each other while we waited for our food (which wasn't a long time by any means). Great little stop."}
{"text":"Really good bar food! My husband and I have been here once and will definitely be back! They had a great variety on the menu and we both really liked our meals. Our waitress was very nice and did great! Adorable prices as well."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food and drinks are great and the employees are incredibly friendly."}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area.  Food was fresh and tasted great. Case was our server and was very attentive without being annoying. Made great suggestions. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"The food was awesome. Wife and Mother in law had the Chipotle Tacos, I went for the grill cheese with Jalapeño and Bacon and it was the bomb. Trevor our waiter was wonderful with everything from our son to delivery of drinks and food. Highly recommend the Pickle Frys for an appetizer!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here when we have our car being serviced down the street.

We enjoy the food and cocktails and the service is always good.  The garlic fries are some of the best we have had.   They have a great menu with lots of choices.

They have a great patio although we haven't sat there yet as it has been too hot outside when we have been there."}
{"text":"I like this place.  Love the food, beer and service.  The ONLY thing wrong is that it is to small.  We have stopped by and just kept on driving because it was full. Parking has a lot to be desired.  So we just head on to Teakwoods just around the corner."}
{"text":"Was so excited to try to this place. We ordered an app, drinks, and two burgers. We waited 40 minutes for our burgers while watching the 9-top (sat after we ordered) and other 2-tops get their food before us. Our server did not check-in with us during the wait, tended to her other tables diligently, and I had to ask the host to find the manager. It's a Wednesday night and the place was not busy. Server continued to avoid us, as did the manager (who we never saw again). I've been in the restaurant business for years and always give the benefit of the doubt. However, if they're a restaurant that is actively refusing the right to serve all people, then I missed the sign in the window. I would not recommend this place to anyone, specifically those within the LGBT community."}
{"text":"Found this place from a BOGO coupon in the Entertainment Book. Great find! Outstanding menu. We've eaten there several times. I love the jalapeño boats, which is jalapeño sliced in half, filled with cheese and bacon, then breaded and fried. Scorpion burger is not as spicey as they let on, but it's one of the best tasting burgers I've had. Lastly, the Moonshine Philly is fantastic. Very juicy and flavorful.

This is a smaller place, and quiet. Lots of TVs to watch a game. The servers have all been very friendly, and the manager takes it upon himself that the customer enjoys their food. One time, my wife ordered a dip duo, with a con queso dip and salsa, and the cheese dip was bad. We hardly ate it. We didn't complain, but noted to the server that it wasn't good. The manager was over in five minutes, apologized, pointed out that it was overlooked/burnt, and when we got the bill, found that it was free.

It's one of our favorite places to go for lunch. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"First time here. The food and service was fine but they definitely had some things to work out.   Our friends little guy ordered a hot dog and when it came out burnt, we let the waiter know. He said no problem. We tried to hand it to him and he said to keep it and they would make another. Then he came back later and said that someone in the back wanted to see the burnt hot dog which we thought was a little odd. Regardless when they brought out the next hot dog it was burnt too. We cut our losses and didn't ask for a third. Asking around to the table everyone said their food was fine. My burger was good however I had ordered the jalapeño burger and what came was just a regular burger. Not sure we'll be back. Flip of a coin"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I tried it for the first time after some family members mentioned it was good.  We went in on Saturday afternoon and sat at the bar, Shannon was behind the bar and she was AMAZING!  So sweet and welcoming, very helpful and just a delight to be around!  We both ordered the scorpion burger which was really good, we had both anticipated it to be a little spicer but it was still delicious!  I can't recall the IPA they had on draft but it was so good!  We will absolutely be back again!"}
{"text":"Nice local bar. Food is really good. place looks really nice. lots of TVs. they do a lot of events from bike crawls to charity golf tournaments. would recommend this place to people looking for a good local sports bar"}
{"text":"Food is so-so. Restaurant is poorly run. Managers are abusive to staff. Won't be giving them my business anymore."}
{"text":"Chandler has needed an upscale Sports Grill for sure and this is it. Great wings dig the Baked and Grilled and food but you have to try the Steak Phoenix sandwich, off the hook and spicy !! Great with an Ice cold beer !!!"}
{"text":"What a great bar & restaurant . Very clean , loved the atmosphere. Great food . Prices were comparable to other restaurants .  Waitresses were very friendly & attentive. Had Cyndi one day , Cassie the next . We went 2 days in a row , we enjoyed it so much."}
{"text":"Ate at the new location on chandler Blvd and I10. Great food and excellent service. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Love me some moonshine! Great place with fun servers and bartenders.  Love a close bar by the house  owned by locals. If you are looking for  wings that can be grilled or baked this  is your spot. Saturday  nights are karaoke which  is always a blast. Smaller bar but  not packed during sports season so you can actually sit and watch  a game without  all the chaos. Will continue to support!"}
{"text":"First timer and the food was amazing. I has the fried pickled fried to start with,  probably the best friend pickles I've had, I also had a girl chz add bacon and my husband had the grill chz burger. Staff was very friendly and my overall experience was great. Def recommend this place. I'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Excellent patio that is pet friendly. The smoking section is at the very end and has fans to blow the smoke away. The rest of the patio has awesome misters and lots of TV's. They have great daily specials plus Wednesday is Trivia night, Friday is karaoke and Saturday is live music. Tonight was a bluegrass band. I had a caramelized onion and Swiss grilled cheese with French onion soup for dipping. I had tater tots as my side. Husband had some type of spicy tacos. They have wings that are baked and then put on the grill which I will try next along with the chicken quesadillas. The burgers also looked good as did the pulled pork sliders that neighboring tables ordered. Service was excellent. Alexis was our server, but everyone herenpitches in to clear dishes, run drinks, etc. it's a great team spirit. I think this would be an awesome place to watch sports on the patio through our hot summers."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday night around 6 because downtown Gilbert was packed. Never heard of it before but the menu looked interesting. I'm not gonna lie, it was just OK. This place has serious potential, but it's not living up to it. Nice clean strip mall sports bar type place. A little too TV focused for my taste. I prefer cool music in my pubs but whatevs. Nothing fancy, not overly nice.  It's a little like a new car. Not quite lived in yet, but if they make it, will be a cool neighborhood joint. You can tell they spent some money putting it together, which is why it's surprising that they miss on some basic stuff.

I'm a beer guy, but didn't have any this time. The local brews on tap are nice, but there aren't many of them. The bottle selection is laughable. Guys, get yourself over to the Handlebar in AJ  or HOB and see what a beer selection looks like. IF they could get to that level, plus get the food on point, they could stake a serious claim.  With literally thousands of amazing brews out there, there is no excuse. Sacrifice a couple of tables and some wall space and put in a killer beer cooler. The liquor and cocktail section of the menu seems to be covered pretty well. There's a moonshine section which is neat. Not clear on whether the moonshine is made in house or not. I assume so. They should highlight that. I didn't see one thing about it. This being AZ, homemade tequila would be a nice addition. Moonshine and whiskey flights are available. Very cool.

Had water to drink this time. From a place that is trying to be somewhat upscale gastropub, it was surprising that it came in a cruddy plastic cafeteria type cup. No lemon, no lime, no refill. Come on guys, pint glasses? Mason Jars? Based on the menu and the vibe of the website, I was expecting cloth napkins wrapped around the kind of silverware that I can't afford. Not picking off that paper sticker like Denny's. Boo. 

Super plus : The menu is varied and interesting.  It's the kind of menu where you're just like, ok, yeah I want all that, bring me everything. They hit all the major categories with lots to choose from, meat eater or not. Long list of interesting side dishes. The grilled veggies were excellent. There is a cool grilled cheese section, but surprisingly no grilled cheese on the kid's menu. Speaking of which, $4.50 for a tiny bowl of kraft mac n cheese grinds my gears a little bit. Just sayin'.  The kid menu is pretty basic and not featured on the website. Room for improvement there, especially at those prices. You can tell it's not a focus, but it would be just as easy to make it cool and interesting and fun. Sometimes I'm a family diner, sometimes it's just the grownups. This place *could* and should be a destination for both. 

Burger selection is nice. I had a hard time choosing. Had the scorpion burger. I asked about getting it with no bun, the waitress said definitely, we'll do it protein style. Sounds good. What I got was maybe a 6oz burger on literally one tiny flat piece of lettuce, one tomato slice, and a tiny amount of red onion. The spicy sauce and stuff on top was tasty and interesting but minimal. Should have been piled high. Extra $1 for a pretty puny pile of sweet potato fries, which were actually quite good. Folks, when In-n-Out and Carl's do a better low-carb burger than you do, you better step up your game. Fast.

The menu looks cool when you show the price of the burger as 9 1/2, but if you're starting your burger at nearly $10 you better come with a half pounder loaded up. Bun or not, I should be picking up your burger and stuffing it in my face with juicy saucy goodness running down my arm. Fireworks should be going off with my head exploding from the flavor insanity. Instead I got sad trombones. Womp womp. A killer huge basket with a homemade moonshine pickle on the side would be something you talk about at work the next day. If food is something you're going to be about, you've got to kill it top to bottom. If you're new and kinda out of the way, it is that much more critical. They missed on this for me.

More plus -  it seems pretty family friendly, with a second dining area separated from the bar. The tables have trivial pursuit cards which is a nice way to pass the time. Our waitress was nice enough. Not particularly engaging, did one check back from about ten feet away then went back to her sidework. Meh. I never did get ketchup. Didn't feel like asking for it. No killer house sauce options? 

I'm happy to pay premium prices for quality independent restaurants. We don't have enough of them. I really like what they're trying to do here. This is the kind of place I would come ALL THE TIME. But with a lackluster beer selection and middling food in poor presentation, it's not likely.  It is clear to see where they're trying to go. SO frustrating to see it come up just that short. I'll be back at least once more probably. Definitely worth a try. Hopefully they get it together before it's too late."}
{"text":"My wife & I decided to give this place a try based on the Yelp reviews. We really enjoyed our dinner - the servers were also fantastic! For those that don't know, this establishment buys their meat and fish from a place called, \"Midwestern Meats\" of Mesa, AZ. When one of the owners, Chuck, told us that, my wife was thrilled! Turns out, Midwestern Meats is a restaurant, butcher shop and wholesale meat distributor.

Chuck explained that they only buy local beer, baked goods, produce, and meat. This is a fantastic establishment that offers awesome food for a decent price. Check their website for the latest menu and activities. As of this writing, they have a karaoke and trivia night along with football games Sunday & Monday.

Thanks for the great time and conversation Chuck!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place for the diverse menu and the trivia! Drinks were great, music was upbeat and the service was prompt. Food was fresh, and portions generous. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Pretty nice renovations and bar. Food was delicious and made fast. Staff was very attentive. Beer was super cold. Ben is awesome! Overall, it's a great place."}
{"text":"Great spot! Love finding hidden away places like this. I've had to have driven past it probably a 100 times and never knew it was there. Good drinks (try the copper mule), and solid food (steak sliders were good-could have used a little more meat though)."}
{"text":"We gave this restaurant a try based on reviews and a recommendation.  Unfortunately, we were disappointed by pretty much everything.  

We went on a Sunday for dinner, and upon entering noticed a nearly empty restaurant side (one table was sat) and a semi-busy bar area.  The hostess was friendly, but sat us next to the bathrooms where we were greeted by the smell of some kind of bathroom sanitizer/urinal cake smell each time the bar patrons went in and out (which was very often).  We promptly asked our waiter to move, which was easy since the restaurant was empty.  Not sure why we were sat there in the first place...  

We ordered a couple beers, which the only choices were four peaks beer or average domestic beer (which we aren't really fans of either).  We also ordered our meals shortly after.  We ordered a burger, chicken fingers tossed in buffalo sauce (which costs extra), and a kids grilled cheese.  After waiting for a long time, almost 25 minutes in an empty restaurant, our waiter came out and said the kitchen screwed up the chicken fingers and it would be a little longer.  They screwed up chicken fingers?  My burger was ready and sitting.  We told him to bring out whatever he had.  He proceeded to bring out my burger and along with that, a kids order of chicken fingers...  All that waiting, and they screwed up the kids dinner.  He took them away to be replaced by the grilled cheese we originally wanted.  As I sat pecking away at my meal, trying not to be rude to the rest of the people at my table with nothing, the chicken fingers come out.  Completely plain.  No sauce.  Nothing.  We asked the waiter if these were buffalo, which he replied \"yes\".  We then asked why they weren't tossed in sauce?  He said \"because that's how they do them here\".  After a few minutes, he returned to say he was wrong and they do have sauce.  So basically, he was lying to our face, which we already knew he was from the start.  He brought out a small cup of the sauce...  

Wrapping up our awesome experience, the waiter walked by the table and set the check in front of me and said \"have a good night\" and continued walking into the back without turning around.  Never once asking if we needed anything else (like a to-go box, which we needed) or at least acting like he cared one bit that we were giving him our hard-earned money for crappy food and even crappier service.

I immediately stood up, walked to the hostess, and requested the manager.  She had a stunned look on her face and walked to another server to apparently start the rumor mill I'd assume?  The server then looked at our table and went and talked to our waiter while the hostess got the manager.  There was a small group of employees, including our waiter, talking and staring at us.  Really professional.  The manager comes out and we explain the situation(s).  She apologizes and comps our entire meal minus drinks.  I appreciated that.  

Very, very long story short.  Go somewhere else.  I'm convinced the good reviews for this place are written by all the bar patrons."}
{"text":"20 some TV's, 6 games going at one time and my team on only one TV in the whole place and they won't put it on another? Complete crap. If their food was really good I would have stayed....but that's not the case."}
{"text":"The food and service are both really good! 
I've been here a few times now and everything has been consistent.  
It was hard to pick what to order off the menu because everything sounded really good! I got the grilled cheese burger and it was delicious! 
Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Nice diverse menu.  Recommend the sliders and garlic fries as an appetizer.  Good beer selection with my favorite IPA from four peaks.  Good service and comfortable seating.  Second time here and very enjoyable.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great spot! First time here and although we hit karaoke night without knowing it, everyone was having fun . Food was great! Awesome garlic fries with the scorpion burger YUM!  Greek salad was delicious! Great service and a fun spot."}
{"text":"Had a burger  and fries very tasty Sarah was very nice and on top of things . Very clean . Nice place to watch a game and have some beers . Happy hr from 3pm- 7pm m-F Sunday -thurs. 10pm -closed"}
{"text":"This place is just an all around great place to go!!! Good people (incredible service) even better food. The grilled wings are just something els, and the garlic fries I can't even begin to tell you how good they are!!! You need to come check this place out!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellant Service. We were not assign a waitress everyone helps each other. We had drinks delivered from one waitress, our order was taken by another and were checking on us every few mins. Food was very good. We had the hummus and flat bread."}
{"text":"Mt husband and I are enjoying a couple of cool ones and just ate the Honey BBQ wings.   All I can say, is they were delicious."}
{"text":"Still awesome! The Apple Pie Martini is still yummy in my tummy! I also tried their French Onion Soup and Grilled Cheese Sandwich (cheese overloaded... yeah) and that was delicious! Great local bar... enjoy sitting outside when it's not hotter than 95°"}
{"text":"Super delicious food good drinks great. I had a Moscow mule & the sucker punch both super delicious drinks & the queso burger. Would definitely get that again. My boyfriend is allergic to gluten & they have gluten free beer & bread options for him which is always good. Definitely making this our usual bar hangout spot. Update: we now come here every Friday night. Trevor & Vanessa are amazing servers. We absolutely love this bar."}
{"text":"Friday Happy Hour with my mom.

GREAT SERVICE!!!

We had honey Hot wings, a fajita salad and fish and chips. 

All of it was delicious. And we used the entertainment app to get BOGO.

Was a great deal."}
{"text":"Love this place! Mac n cheese is really good. Highly recommend the grilled cheese cheeseburger too!"}
{"text":"First time we came here service was awesome and appetizers were OK, but probably because we were drunk. The bartender we had (middle aged women on Saturday evening) was amazing.

Second time around, food was horrible, waitress sucked, and a rookie bartender.

First of all, how does a bartender that works at a bar not know what bourbon served \"neat\" means. He had the waitress come back and ask us what we meant by \"neat.\" Oh come on dude, the bar has a pretty bad ass selection of bourbons and you don't know how to serve a neat drink? 

The waitress who's name was Heather, who was the only server on shift was clueless how to tend tables. We had to tell her to remove food trays, she was eating at the table next to us and we didn't feel like interrupting her \"lunch\" by asking her for extra plates. She definitely needs to take some waitressing classes.

We had the following:

Appetizers - cheese sticks: not good at all, was still a little cold.

Buffalo wings: not too bad 

Jalapeño poppers - decent 

Fried mac n cheese - not good, too oily, too salty

Main Course -

Spicy steak sandwich - sauce was not good at all, lacked flavor

Dessert -

We had 2 milkshakes and they weren't good at all. Better off going to Jack in the box.

Not a second good impression and we probably won't end up returning anytime soon unless it'll be on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Been back probably 15 times now since it is walking distance from the house. Food is still 5 stars most night, but some times it isn't. Must have a different kitchen crew at times. 

The bacon wrapped hot dogs were amazing last night. A few weeks ago the burgers/grilled cheese were blah. They just need to work on keeping it consistently 5 star which 9/10 times it is."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!! And let me tell you my family and I have been here multiple times already and tried new things each time and we have never been disappointed on what we ordered! The food is absolutely amazing! The staff is so nice as well very personable and I love that!!! They are super sweet and if you have any questions on the menu they are more than willing to help you decide on that yummy meal!  The moonshine drinks are awesome as well!! Very kid friendly place also!"}
{"text":"Ice...cold...beer (and yummy food)!!!!  I had the beef and blue salad and my husband had burger sliders; both were awesome.  We stayed for karaoke on Friday night....so fun!  But the beer was so cold and awesome.  Love it!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite spot.  Very casual and everything I order turns out amazing.  Tonight I ordered the French onion grilled cheese - amazing!  Overall just love the staff and the food."}
{"text":"This place has become my new hangout since they opened. The owners, Chuck and Stephen, are great guys who are always there making sure the customers are happy and everything is going good. They have lots of local l beers on tap (San Tan and Four Peaks). The garlic fries, wings and sliders are usually my go-to food items and the Scorpion burger is a must try on the menu. They have Buzztime trivia which is always fun to play and free. So come down and give this place a try. It's a great local bar that I'm much happier spending my money at than some crappy national chain."}
{"text":"The B&G wings are phenomenal!  They come with a very creamy, thick ranch dressing.  Not the cheap runny stuff!  I tried the garlic fries for the first time and they were delish!  Chunks of garlic and bacon bits.  They were perfect!  My waitress was great, always checking on me and always smiling.  Lots of TV's to enjoy a variety of games.  This is my new favorite place!!"}
{"text":"One star is a generous review.   The place was empty on a Saturday night so that should have been our first clue.  The food was bland and the portions were laughable.  I wanted a Flatbread and asked to add a side of garlic fries (which is an extra $2.50 to sub instead of a regular side- already an outrageous upcharge!). The waitress informed me that the computer wouldn't allow her to add on the side so it would be an extra $4.75 - for a side of fries!!!   So I settled on the Mac n cheese for 10.xx and added chicken and tomatoes- for an extra $2.50. I was given a small bowl of penne noodles in a milky sauce with literally a quarter tsp worth of chopped tomatoes and 2 specks of chicken.  It was completely devoid of flavor, because garlic was also an extra charge!  
My husband got the overpriced patty melt because well, a grilled cheeseburger sounded pretty damn amazing.  The patty melt next door at Denny's has more flavor than this one did.  

We love to try new places in the area and have found quite a few good bars and restaurants.  This is not one of them and we will never return."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today with my GF.  It was OK.  Nothing special, but OK.  Food was acceptable but not outstanding.  Prices a little on the high side.  Probably all sandwiches maybe $1.50 higher than the competitive norm, and entrees maybe $2.00 higher than the competitive norm.  I had a craft beer for $6.00 which is about $1.00 higher than the norm.  Portion sizes are average.  So all in all, it was an OK lunch.  i might go back if I am in the area and need someplace to park my butt and have lunch, but I would not go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"The grilled cheeseburger was amazing!!! I wake up in the middle of the night craving another! They serve Guinness too, so you know they have their shiznit together!"}
{"text":"When we ordered our meals my husband told them he doesn't like seasoned meat burgers. When it came out it was so heavily seasoned it tasted like an overly seasoned meatloaf. Completely inedible for us. The waiter then said that the cooks told him as he was taking the food out that the seasoning is so minor is cooks off. Uhh no! I don't mind seasoned meat and it was too much for me too. While friendly and apologetic, there wasn't an offer to take it off the check or try another meal. Very disappointing experience. 

My BBQ chicken flat bread was fine. Nothing unique or special. Good size if you're not a big eater. Seasoned/coated fries with burger weren't bad. FYI-
It's a loud sports bar atmosphere. We enjoyed sitting outside with TV as background noise while playing trivia. Sadly, we probably won't be back. Had they offered a substitution or removing it from the check, we would give it another try but my bbq flat bread wasn't worth $20."}
{"text":"The chicken sliders are the bomb!!! The chicken tacos were ehhhh....  I wouldn't do them again. It's always nice to stop by and watch some Sunday football and grab a bite!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim and boy am I glad we did. A perfect day to eat outside so we sat on the patio. 
Started with the garlic fries, perfectly crispy and smothered in garlic, bacon and Parmesan cheese. 
I had the beef and blue salad, a nice spinach salad topped with tender shaved beef, crispy onions and blue cheese. Hubby had the grilled chicken sliders, topped with bacon and avocado.
He also had grilled veggies as a side, perfectly grilled with a nice char and nice smokey taste definitely done over a real fire. 
Our server Abby was helpful and attentive, she did a nice job describing menu items. Granted it was a Sunday lunch, but there were several others on the patio and Abby checked on everyone frequently.
I know this is a \"brew house\" but the food is worth the trip. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is a new bar/grill that opened up this week in Gilbert.  I stopped in to see what it's all about and I was really impressed.  The staff was exceptionally friendly and the music was not obnoxious or loud (you can still carry on a conversation without yelling).

They feature beers on tap from Four Peaks and San Tan Brewery, as well as some of the standards.  Their menu looks great with both classic and unique dishes.  I started with the wings, because I don't have much faith in a bar/grill that can't make decent wings.  They were delicious (I went for medium, and it was a great blend of sweet and spicy).  I also ordered the pulled pork sandwich, which was excellent.  For an extra dollar, I upgraded my side to the garlic fries and, lemme tell you, WORTH IT!  Best garlic fries I've ever had!

My girlfriend is a vegetarian, so I was pleased to see that pretty much every section of the menu had something meatless for her to order.

I haven't tried the whole menu yet, but I got a stellar first impression from this place and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We love this place! Copper Still has a great atmosphere! Friendly staff, t.v.'s everywhere, huge bar, and the best happy hour! This is our go to wing place. Everything we have tried so far is amazing, but their wings are the best!"}
{"text":"We needed a little change so we decided to try this place with the family.  Reviews seemed decent enough.  
We were greeted by a young 15 year old and our waitress was not much older than that.  Service was 2-3 stars, but the drinks were dismal.  Oh yeah, their printer was broken so no kids menus for our children.  OK, food.....Who messes up soda water?  My wife ordered a cosmopolitan (simple bar 101 drink) and it was terrible.  Manager (who was about 19 years old) apologized and brought another (new bartender she said).  My drink was so-so.
The 2nd Cosmo was so bad we sent it back for good.
Kids spaghetti sauce was no Bueno.
Chicken sandwich bottom bun was so soggy my oldest son could not pick it up to eat.
Sorry to say this place needs a more mature management to stay in business.  If this is what customers get on a Friday night...such a shame."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff. Strawberry Peach White Sangria was wonderful and refreshing. The Popper sandwich was tasty and crispy. With a side of garlic fries (which are huge and enough to share), it was the perfect meal and had plenty of leftovers. Hubs had the blue cheese burger and slammed that down in no time.  Sundae was a big hit with the little one. 

Service was great up until the food was delivered. Refills weren't offered , and we were done eating for about 15 minutes before our waitress eventually stopped by our table to ask if we wanted the check. 

It was a Friday night and they were busy, but our waitress walked by many times without stopping. We had empty plates and drinks on the table and no one was actively eating, so it should've been obvious we were done. 

Other than the wait for the check, nothing turned us off from eating here again. We will definitely come back to try some of their other signature drinks."}
{"text":"Good selection of beers, good apps, wings were fairly standard but tasty. Good service."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this bar for awhile since I just moved to the area. I liked all the Whiskey selection and the wings and fries were really good! Try the Honey Hot and Arizona Gold!"}
{"text":"Decent food, we'll be back. Love they have option for not fried wings but instead baked and grilled with whatever sauce or dry rub. The pretzel and cheese app was nummy, the perfect size portion. My fiancé got the grilled cheese burger which wasn't what he was expecting so a tad disappointed. The menu looks great though with lots of options to try for next time."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood bar..$3 Bloody Mary's on Sunday's...yum...food is good...large selection of sides...now the reason for only 3 stars.  If you pay cash watch out.  They do not return coins.  First time this happened to friend about a month ago..no explanation they just returned his bills...was like 32 cents so no big deal I guess...today I was due $4.73 in change ..received $4.. I called waitress over and asked her were my coins were...her answer...we don't carry coins...I told her to take the 73 and add it towards her tip.  Not sure many people pay cash but this is a rip off...over the course of a month..year I am sure they make enough to have nice holiday party."}
{"text":"Great place. Wide variety of things on menu. A little pricey for lunch. Food was good."}
{"text":"First time here. Nice and low key for afternoon lunch on Saturday. Good selection of local beers on tap. Small patio to enjoy weather. Glad I came to try out. Chicken Caesar Salad was good."}
{"text":"I am normally a big fan of Copper Still, however we got delivery on Friday night and the food was not as good as it is at the restaurant.   Both orders of Baked and Grilled wings were so over charred that you could not taste either sauce, they simply tasted burned.  In the restaurant we would have sent them back because of the mistake, but with delivery, you get what you get.

Still really like the restaurant, but I wont ever do delivery again."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious and I love that they have something to meet any craving from wings to pasta! This is my favorite place to get a great Moscow Mule and moonshine specialty drinks. The patio is great, my family spent hours relaxing on the patio and enjoying the great weather!"}
{"text":"Stopped in C.S. on a Sunday to nurse a hangover, after searching yelp for a new place we decided here.

The blonde bartender was outstanding, chatty, friendly, and quick with our orders. They had my favorite beers on tap (Hop Knot and Summer Shanty)
The garlic fries are a must have, we licked the bottom of the skillet when we were done!!  We also had the grilled cheese burger, a grilled cheese on sourdough with a burger patty in the middle. It was.....ok.

Interior was pretty plain jane nothing dazzled me. Over all I'll come back because of the friendly staff and the decent beer on tap......and the garlic fries."}
{"text":"First time eating here even though it is so close to my house. Had lunch with a friend.  I will definitely be back! The food is great and came out really fast. We had a great server I think her name is Shannon. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"At first when you walk in it smells like farts but the food is good and after one moonshine flight and some one man karaoke can't barely tell and had a great time."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner and drinks before a show on a Tuesday evening. Our waiter, Hayden, was very pleasant and attentive. We had moonshine flights (the peach was my favorite!), drinks, appetizers and sandwiches with side salads. The garlic fries are SO GOOD. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Worse blue cheese burger I have ever had. Food was all very greasy. My burger was dripping grease. Very slow service and waited 40 minutes to get my meal. Avoid this place like the plague. I am not even sure my burger was real beef. Yikes!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times in the evening. Each time we try something different. My favorite so far is the blue cheese burger with a good San Tan brew. The atmosphere is casual and not too loud like some bars. While we were there to eat and watch the game they also had a paint party. Nice place to go. Fast and quality service every time. Also, try their moonshine drinks, well made and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch football. Big bar, lots of room to spread out. Been here quite a bit... Our new local spot for Awhatukee.  Glad Copper Still Moonshine is here."}
{"text":"Okay, husband and I were traveling...In town for 5 days, had Copper Still Moonshine Grill for 3 consecutive dinners. 

Not only was the staff amazing, the food was phenomenal.

The Grand Canyon Burger was basically a religious experience. Every item we ate was better than the last, you can tell that quality is important - every tot was crunchy and every piece of lettuce was fresh. 

As a Chicagoland-resident, where food is what we are known for, would recommend this place to anyone. 

Can't wait to visit & have them again!"}
{"text":"We love this place. We have been three times. Each time the food was great, the service was good, and there were plenty of good drinks to choose from. It tends to be a bit chilly in there (I'm a wimp), so bring a jacket if you get cold easily. We plan to be regulars!"}
{"text":"Love the moonshine taster.  Food is great.  Plenty of tv's to enjoy any sporting event"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after getting my nails done next door.  Late lunch, like 2pm, so the place was pretty dead. But I didn't mind. Sat at the bar, had 2 different servers/bartenders help me, and both were friendly and attentive.  I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and garlic fries based on recommendation from the bartender. Very good, although I had garlic breath the rest of the day. My fault for ordering garlic at lunch. I had a couple drinks (don't judge) and they were good, not super strong but not just water either (I ordered vodka/soda). 2 thumbs up, and I will definitely be back. Their menu has A LOT of really good looking things on it that I want to try."}
{"text":"Have come here a couple of times and it will be our go-to now.They have a fantastic happy hour, quality-wise and price-wise. The place is prettier on the inside than the outside and it's easy to miss. Has been pretty quiet when we've been in, around 4 pm on weekdays. Staff is very friendly and attentive - our server remembered us from our first time there. Yay, good local business!"}
{"text":"Not just a neighborhood bar - divided dining area and family friendly.  Our 5 year old snarfed down the burger and fries.  We split the nachos - toppings layered thru dish and not just piled on top.  Nice serving sizes and great service - nice job Abby!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch!  Menu has an excellent selection of salads, sandwiches, and some Mexican favorites.  Try the Sloppy Joe tacos!  Beer selection is good, and always ice cold!"}
{"text":"We are loving this place! Good food , great service and cold beer! The bartender \"Ben\" is awesome."}
{"text":"A wonderful place to go, perfect for couples, singles or the entire family. We enjoyed our first visit so much, we went back later the same week. Their grilled cheese sandwiches are so tasty. And their side dishes are plentiful. Give your stomach and tastebuds a treat and order their specialty garlic fries. Their cocktails are quite refreshing, a favorite of ours was their Kentucky Mule. If you're lucky, Vanessa will be your server, extremely pleasant and competent."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of character! They also have the meatiest wings I've ever eaten. They were slightly charred in the oven, but the taste was great and they were oh, so, meaty! 

I went with some buddies for trivia night on a Thursday, and I was very pleasantly surprised. We ended up winning trivia and got a $30 gift certificate. Awesome prize that can almost pay for a drinks tab! The beer was excellent as well; good selection and price.

Very courteous wait staff, combined with a great atmosphere and great food earns a five star review in my book."}
{"text":"This is our down the road, \"Go to\" place when we want something quick, at a good price, and can wear what ever we have on....  GREAT FRIENDLY STAFF. Maybe it's my age...but now days that matters to us as much as the food. No matter what, they've always been so friendly. Always very accommodating. 

Food is great for the price. Happy Hour - definitely worth it! Good apps and drinks! 

Only missing 1 star due to: How very loud it can get in there early in the event....(which obviously can't be avoided during a playoff time in a sports bar etc.) AND...of course it's our fun place to go during those times as well for the great atmosphere, view of tv's, etc.  I only which they'd start  their Trivia team games a little later in the evening. We're usually their at dinner hour but can't hear each other over the announcer for trivia who's very loud and almost startling every time he speaks. If you aren't playing the game, can be rather non-relaxing..... And yet we still go so that should tell you something about the food and wait staff right there.  

**** having said all that I wish they had a few good deserts to choose from for the night you want to splurge."}
{"text":"I had the garlic fries and cheeseburger sliders, and they were both delicious! Our waitress was friendly, smiling, and helpful! The owner, Chuck, even came out to greet us. He is a great guy! We felt like we were old  friends being welcomed. Great place!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, my girlfriend and I both enjoyed it, we will return.

Try the Devil Bites! They're spicy (not too much), with just the right amount of cheese and are super crispy! The grilled cheeseburger is a bit oily, but not bad! My girl had the Popper grilled cheese, she liked it, I thought it had a bit too much cream cheese."}
{"text":"1st things, 1st, let's cut to the chase: THERE is a water treatment plant is close by, but once your nose becomes immune to, there are NO ISSUES!!

We were searching for Burgers and TATER TOTS..after some googling and Yelping, we found the best gem ever!!

Service: THE amazing TREVOR!!!!!!
Our Waiter TREVOR TREVOR TREVOR TREVOR TREVOR was the reason, besides the delicious food that we will be returning this next weekend. I hope the business owners are aware of this wonderful employee and that they are aware how stellar he is to their customers. 
He has a sense of PRIDE in the company and in what he does. Great way about him and excellent service, He is very wonderful asset. We will be in Scottsdale (we are from Tucson) for another soccer tournament this upcoming weekend and we are making it a point to go back for lunch or dinner on Saturday. WE hope Trevor is there again!

Food: Fabulous comfort, belly bomb food!!!
The garlic fries were very good. The burgers, UNBELIEVEABLE DELICIOUS Scorpion GRILLED CHEESE BURGER...OMG!! OMG!!!...and go for the Nachos, but make it \"RED-TOT\" style (that's what I call it)..Substitute the nacho chips and have them use the tater tots...ask for cheese sauce too...you will not be disappointed in this food.

This place, food, service ROCKS. Wish we had one in Tucson!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. I enjoyed the food and the great service. I was currently visiting from Chicago in a business trip. I recommend the grilled double cheddar burger on the sour dough bread with a Mexican Amber from the Pedal
Haus Brewery."}
{"text":"They have Wonderful food. The unique grilled cheese sandwiches on the menu are good. I especially liked the French Onion grilled cheese served with an onion beef broth for dipping. Their tomato basil soup is AMAZING!!!  The menu offered a lot more food options than I thought it would being a bar/grill, even good salads on the menu. We brought our kids,  they both ate well and we will be back!"}
{"text":"A new spot that we've made our new Friday night favorite.  Excellent craft beer, moonshine, and their dry heat spice rub is incredible.

Try the Scorpion Burger (Dry heat rubbed with jalapeño and spicy mayo) or the Steak Phoenix (Spicy Philly Cheesesteak) if you like a little kick.  Both if these tasty little devils have been making my mouth water since I left.  The waffles fries are good as well as the garlic fries.

My wife loves the grilled chicken sliders.  I had a bite and thought they were among the best chicken sliders I've ever had.  Decent kids options and great homemade, moonshine inspired cocktails.

The only thing I don't like is that their patio allows smoking.  We sat out there with the kids not knowing this and no one told us when they seated us.  We were stuck next to chain smoking jerks whose every other word was f@#&.  It was our fault for not checking though, so I won't let it affect my review.

This is the kind of spot that we want to see do well in the neighborhood.  The living social deal is going to put this place on the map.  It's already much busier."}
{"text":"If my wife and I were actually served, I would offer a better review. We went around 1:30p on a Sunday and it was not busy at all. A couple people at the bar and people at two other tables. Our waitress walked passed us on multiple occasions, she didn't even acknowledge us. After 20 minutes of being ignored, in which we didn't even get water, my wife and decided to leave. Completely unacceptable service."}
{"text":"Three of my favorite things....a super cold beer (literally had ice floating), grilled wings(cooked well done as I requested ) and amazingly crispy garlic fries!  Great service.  The menu has a wide variety of items so everyone should be able to find their thing.  Looking forward to coming back and giving one of their salads a try."}
{"text":"I like this place! Love all the different combinations of drinks, so hard to choose! My favorite are the grilled cheese sandwiches with the crisp cut fries. Staff is friendly and attentive, food and drinks are great and the place has a great atmosphere. Very casual. Good local hangout!"}
{"text":"Couldn't have asked for better service. Visited for lunch while Talia was bartending on a Tuesday afternoon after leaving a nearby restaurant for poor service. I was very happy that I made the decision to leave that restaurant and come here. My drink was never empty, she was extremely attentive and friendly. She was very nice about asking the few of us sitting at the bar if we would be comfortable with her opening the bar window prior to doing so. Not to mention the grilled cheese burger is UH-MAZE-ING!! Great food, great service and a great environment... what more could you ask for!? Will definitely be visiting again soon!!"}
{"text":"Thanks to a recommendation from Yelp, we decided to try this restaurant for something different. The atmosphere was a mixture of Arizona landmarks and sports. The music was good ol' Southern blues. The owner, Chuck, was very friendly and hospitable. Our waitress, Beth, had wonderful suggestions. We had the Signature Mac & Cheese with chicken and bacon. It was the best Mac & Cheese ever. Literally! We topped it off with the Dessert Nachos. Fabulous!"}
{"text":"Second time at this location and still impressed. It might not be five star good, but the service, consistency, and quality give it the five star rating. As solid bar food goes, this is the best in the east valley. Worth a try for a local bar/grill."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for lunch but the food and service was excellent. Will definitely come back in the future to check out the bar offerings."}
{"text":"My husband and I are very pleased with the service we received. This was our first time here. We received excellent customer service and the food was delicious! Well deserving of a five star rating!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our first visit here. Service was prompt and the waiter was very sweet. Ordered the grilled cheeseburger with fries and it was very good. I highly recommend it! 

I ordered a drink called the front porch and it was weak. Had no taste at all and you couldn't taste any liquor in that drink. I do plan to go back and check out the happy hour that everyone's been raving about."}
{"text":"First time here but after seeing fellow  yelpers check in,  thought we'd give it a chance.  Boyfriend lives nearby so it's very convenient.  
Sat at the bar,  my favorite spot,  and was greeted by a male and female bartender.  
Made it in time for happy hour specials on a Saturday night.  Had beer and looked at a menu.  Great food selection.  We chose to drink first.  Bartenders introduced themselves and welcomed us and told us about their specials.  Made us feel very welcomed.  Offered a sample of moonshine since I've never tried before... Apple pie was phenomenal!! Drank a moonshine specialty drink and it was so good. 
After several drinks we ordered their signature garlic fries, they were awesome.  
All in all I think we've found our new neighborhood bar to hang out at.  Been to Zipps and Native,  but the customer service and attention was awesome here.  Nothing better than sitting at the bar with a cold beer sports and my boyfriend.  
Thanks for a great experience and as we left we learned that the male bartender was the owner.  
Support local businesses!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Me and the hubby have been here twice now for karaoke. Their karaoke system is one of the best we have heard. The guy who runs it is very nice and helpful also. It's always a great time listening to people sing. We haven't tried the food yet, we will have to give that a try sometime. We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"It was nice sitting outside. Although people can smoke which kills the rating for me. But the server was super on it and the food was good."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after reading the Yelp reviews.  We are new to the area.  It's a nice sports bar & the happy hour prices are great.  I tried the pineapple margarita and the regular margarita. Both were delicious.  The hubby and I split some wings, and the popper gourmet grilled cheese sandwich.  The wings were very good and the sandwich was awesome.  This will be a place we come back to."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and very friendly service. Our server, Abby, was on top of things during the Saturday night rush. We were taken care of quickly and courteously. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff made our visit memorable. We will definitely be back. We visited the Gilbert location and were excited to see this one here in Chandler."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place existed before I searched for NTN trivia locations.  What a hidden gem.  I knew Teakwoods was in this center... honestly; who cares about that place?  Not me.  This Copper Still however, is something to be excited about.  Great food and great people.  I can not rave enough about the garlic fries.  I am hooked.  The flavor haunts me.  Check it out for yourself , I am pretty sure you will find your own favorite on the extensive menu and drink offerings."}
{"text":"Amazing food and WOW....the Moonshine \"Flight\"!  How fun!  Texas Hold'em Poker night was fun for the men in the family, and Karaoke got the girls in on the fun."}
{"text":"Service was good and menu selection provided for a bit of everything which not everyone does. They messed up one of our orders (cook issue) but quickly recovered and apologized which is greatly appreciated and isn't held against them. Our food tasted good as well. The layout of the place however hasn't changed since it's previous owner and unfortunately along with that the noise/loudness remains :(  .For 7:30 on a Wednesday night I was almost having to yell to the person seated 2  feet away next to me to have a conversation. The acoustic's in this place are just bad, very very loud and lots of echoing of everyone's voices like your in a concert hall. Wish yelp gave 1/2 stars as I would give this place a 3.5. Might be back when it is less busy and a bit quieter."}
{"text":"This is a pretty chill place, you can buy your friends drinks on the chalk board. Food was fine. I've had the moonshine mules every time I've been there. Quite tasty."}
{"text":"We shared wings, Mac and cheese, fries, flatbread and chicken tenders and everything was really tasty."}
{"text":"we occasionally come here for happy hour. The food is pretty good and the service is as well. We love their chicken wings and the hummus platter is very good as well. We love to play the trivia game there as well. Nice place!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and staff were nice/cool! Scorpion burger was good not great, my bun fell apart. My Bloody Mary was great, the Apple pie moonshine was the best! May go back for a happy hour."}
{"text":"I was not pleased with this place. I ordered the sautéed mushroom Swiss burger and waffle fries and as an appetizer cheese sticks. The cheese sticks where hard our waitress didn't ask how I wanted my meat cooked and all the mushrooms where on one side of the burger. When I did bite into the mushrooms they tasted like someone didn't wash the dirt off of them. The waffle fries where good and I understand why they give such a big cup to drink...cause the waitresses really didn't come around."}
{"text":"I went a couple nights ago and had a great experience, the waiter was incredible and so attentive. He even followed me to the patio to make sure the heaters were on when I went to have a smoke. I had the jalapeño boats and they were so good. The steak sliders are out of this world. Very clean establishment and with wonderful food and great service you cannot go wrong. I will definitely be back. I am already craving the sliders again."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and can't wait to go back!  The steak and pulled pork sliders are great - lots of meat and well seasoned.  Wait staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"My family and I came in on a Sunday morning. 

The service was very friendly, fast and good.  We got our food very quickly.  All of our meals were good and the portions were big.   I don't think any of us completely finished our plates."}
{"text":"This place is even better now. The food is seriously amazing, some of the best American bar food, and it's not the typical styles either. Their boneless (honey mustard + buffalo) wings were one of the best wing sauces I've ever had. This is one of our favorite places to go now."}
{"text":"The garlic fries are to die for! Terrific menu, friendly service and innovative drinks. Yum! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Decent food. Very loud, open setting like the previous place. 

For me, a remodel of the place is needed instead of a new coat of paint and new pictures on the wall. 

We'll try again and put our expectations in line before we go.  It's more like Zipp's and Native than we thought it would be."}
{"text":"I come here just for the chicken wings.  They are crispy and cooked to perfection.  They come out after about five minutes of ordering.  I also had sliders which were very good.  Drink specials are good value for the money.  Plenty of TV's  in the bar area and the dining area to watch the game.  Very clean and servers are friendly. Cees was our server he was excellent."}
{"text":"This place is ok.  The trivia is what usually brings us here.  We usually sit at the bar and service is always great.  I love the hummus plate and their fries are great.  It's basically bar food though.  They do have a veggie burger that you can put in any of their menu burgers.  They have some interesting grilled cheeses, like the artichoke/spinach one, but I haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best. The flight of moonshine was good. It was trivia night, which is cool.  However, in between trivia questions, the music was so loud that I could not have a conversation with anyone at my table. Nor could I hear the waitress when she came to our table."}
{"text":"I went for the first time for my birthday & came back the very same week!  Yum!   The chicken chicharrones are to DIE for!  I highly recommend the moonshine flight if you want to try something different.  Definitely a hidden jewel in our community!"}
{"text":"Must try the GARLIC FRIES!!!
Good variety on the menu & drinks.
They says kids are welcome....but definitely a BAR."}
{"text":"My wife and I were craving a burger earlier. Based on yelp reviews we tried the Copper Still. 

All I can say is, I'm glad we did. 

We shared the garlic fries which came out on a white hot skillet, stepped in flavor. 

My scorpion burger stung my palate in the most pleasurable way. My wife's queso burger was delicious and a must for anyone craving the flavor of green chilies and cheese. 

Hop knot on tap? Ok, ya got me. 

Service was friendly and timely. 

Good to see the place packed at 5pm on a Friday. 

Cons: the onion rings, although good, were Sisco or similar. Can't do everything by hand right? And the water? I'm sorry but the term \"reclaimed\" comes to mind. 

All in all, we will be back multiple times I'm sure!"}
{"text":"First off let me start off by giving Ben a big shout out. Me and my wife started going there when the place had just opened up and he was hooking it up with the flavored moonshine. We been back there a couple of other times and he's a real friendly down to earth guy. My son and I stopped in for dinner. Garlic fries are killer the jalapeño bacon wrapped hot dog was great and my son had no complaints about his burger. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was JUST OK, nothing special. Had the Parmesan crusted chicken sandwich which was literally just fried chicken, no flavor. Sucker punch was good."}
{"text":"Went to the new location last night. Purchased a Groupon and was accepted at the Chandler location so I was super happy about that. We ordered a few of their signature drinks and they were pretty tasty. We questioned our waitress about the moonshine and she gave us a free samples to try. They were pretty yummy. We were acknowledged as soon as we walked in, we were sat immediately. Our waitress was very nice, personable and knowledgeable of all the items. We had the B & G wings, the chipotle chicken tacos with a side of garlic fries. Plenty of food for 2 people if not too much, lol. Everything tasted pretty good. There are tv's throughout the place and they have music playing. The music wasn't the greatest but it wasn't awful. Overall we had a great experience and we will be going back. Hopefully this restaurant sticks around as it has quite the turn over due to the tucked away location. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Love this place - me and my dad's happy hour spot.  Great, friendly service."}
{"text":"The customer service by the bar staff at this restaurant is above and beyond most places I've been too.  The food is great and my wife and I have now become regulars.  Keep up the great service - Tal"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a place that has a Flux Capacitor burger ... and serves Moonshine. Pleasant atmosphere, TV's anywhere you turn, friendly & attentive staff, quality lip-smackin' food. What else ya want? Head on over friends and neighbors, you'll love it. 

I was here with the beautiful Brewster family. We arrived on a Tuesday evening around 6:30 or so. Now, Copper Still Moonshine Grill is a fine place to watch a game. But we had just watched Madison deliver a beat down as PG for the Campo Verde varsity team. We were here for the scrumptious dinner fare.

I have been here several times. Each time I have tried something new and I've been pleased with the result. This go 'round I had the fish & chips. I'm craving them again just typing this. The fish had just the right amount of tasty crispy breading for the generous amount of Atlantic Cod filets.

My advice, warm up with a moonshine. I'm partial to Ole Smokey Blackberry and Firefly Peach (fav).

Other reliably tasty items include:
- the wings, we get half dry rubbed and half sauced... excellent
- cheesesteaks, cheesy goodness, I like the Steak Phoenix 
- salads, cool crisp awesomeness
- pickle fries, adding this item because Darcie loves them, me, I don't understand frying pickles
- the burgers are tasty, I'm partial to the Scorpion... sans mayo (no liquid chicken for me.. bleech)

Good stuff. Go get yours."}
{"text":"Unless you order from Talia it is never right. I just ordered 2 dozen extra crispy dry rub for takeout. Just got home received barely grilled sauce wings. Super Bowl disappointment."}
{"text":"This place is okay.  I ordered the carne asada tacos, which were a bit bland for my taste and had quite a bit of gristle.  It seems more like a place to go as a novelty for moonshine."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch to find they had some good options for people on keto. Got the D&G Wings, which were amazing. My family got the BBQ flatbread, Mac & Cheese, and Chicken Tacos. Service was awesome and lunch wasn't super crowded either. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent, went for lunch on Saturday. Buffalo bikes were crunchy with good flavor. Southwest chic salad was delicious. My husband had the jalapeño popper grilled cheese and loved it. Beers were great local beers on tap. We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"How do I even start...what a waste of time!! The waitress...horrible don't know her name since she failed to mention it. She had a piss poor attitude from the start...i had no problem walking out of this after she brought out only half of my correct order and then asked my companion if she ordered food?! I can't wait to NEVER return to this place!"}
{"text":"$3.00 bloody Mary's on Sunday's are decent- can't expect too much with $3.00 bloodys :) we ordered the artichoke flatbread and the popper grilled cheese with waffle fries. Both were very good. Couldn't believe this place wasn't packed on a Sunday! Great hang out spot."}
{"text":"First time there, heard good things.  Was a little disappointed in that we didn't realize it was more of a bar with primarily fried food.  If you're looking for some good cold beer and pretty good garlic fries, it's a good place to go."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and it was pretty good. Love moonshine so I thought I would try one of the mixed drinks since it was on happy hour and only $3. This drink confirmed why I stick with beer at the bars and stay away from mixed drinks. Supposed to have peach moonshine along with pineapple juice and other stuff. All I could taste was pineapple juice . No alcohol taste at all. Food and staff was excellent. Atmosphere was good with plenty of TVs."}
{"text":"It was alright but not a 4 star. Prices are too high. Hamburger was $10 too high. Would not go back as I feel the price is too high for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I was staying at a nearby hotel and decided to try the Copper Still. It was quite a surprise. I dined on the Shrimp tacos and really enjoyed them. They had plenty of flavor and texture. Trevor was excellent, very attentive, but not overbearing. I will definitely dine here again when I'm in town for work."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Groupon and did not know what to expect. Sometimes these Groupon experiments do not end well, but for Copper Still it could not have been better. The beer was delicious. Pulled pork was out of this world. Smoked to perfection just how real BBQ should be. The poblano pasta was spicy and delicious as well. The staff is friendly and very attentive. The owner Steve walked around and said hi just like a little hometown joint. Abby is the exact replica of a perfect waitress. If you are considering it you will not be disappointed when you come to The Still."}
{"text":"Been here several times, never had a bad dish and service is always great! Also a great place to watch football on Sunday."}
{"text":"So I'm currently sitting here waiting for my food. I hardly ever post to Yelp but feel compelled to do so. We have ordered a kids hot dog and and an  order of 12 wings and are approaching the 45min mark with only 1 visit from our server. She is now avoiding our table due to embarrassment. The restaurant is about 1/2 full. No excuse for this poor service."}
{"text":"Arrived at 2:30 on Monday afternoon (because our lives are awesome and we are not at work). There was nobody here. At all. Greeted immediately. Immediately impressed with the decor and cleanliness. Having JUST read the review of someone who was allegedly here an hour before us, would've thought that's why it was empty. I will at this time address his review:  don't know what supersonic hearing Bill S has but we found it to be normal bar volume music and a good variety at that. Also, having never visited the place before it was Copper Still I can't speak to his recommendations for \"renovation\", but the place is awesome. It's open. Great patio. 19 or more TVs. Clean. Brand new bar surface. Cool decor. Bill S must like the partitioned look of 80-90's chain restaurants. I found it visually appealing. Now to the important issues. Served IMMEDIATELY by bartender Shannon. Frosty glass. So frosty ice pieces formed on the glass. 16 beers on tap and as many bottled. Large choices of house made drinks and 7 bourbon specials. Daily and happy hour specials are more than decent (see attached). Scorpion burger grilled cheese style is a level above. Spicy/cheesy/beefy awesomeness that is rarely replicated. Side of grilled vegetables was equally great. Choice of SEVERAL sides. They didn't let us down. Friendly+efficient service+clean+updated and new decor+overly decent number of taps and televisions.  Not sure where Bill S normally patronizes but this place is NOTHING like Native or any of those chains. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Friendly staff too.   Had the scorpion burger with garlic fries and had devil bites as an appetizer.  It was all good and cooked well. Burger had fresh jalepenos.  I will be back to eat/drink here again."}
{"text":"So happy that we stumbled upon this place. great drink pours, friendly staff, yummy food, and the Golden Tee machine is in the best place, tucked in the corner away from heavy foot traffic. We will definitly be back again and again!!"}
{"text":"We thought we'd try a different place since the reviews were so good.  Unfortunately, all of our drinks came out wrong.  My Cosmo was all syrup.  The manager tried to make it right and got me a new one which was okay so I ordered a 2nd which came out again as all syrup.  My husband did like his French onion soup but my chorizo tacos smelled like dog food so I couldn't get past that.  My son couldn't eat his spaghetti either - I don't even know how you can mess up spaghetti?  The staff all seem very young and inexperienced too.   The menu looked good but we were very disappointed."}
{"text":"Still a three at best! I came today in hopes I would be able to say it was better! I would say no better no worse except the nachos were no more than a pile of chips with various stuff like cheese, tomatoes, minute cilantro and barely any meat. The quac was good, the salsa was like it came from a can. Anyway I'm up in the air as to my return? I appreciate mgt taking care of the nachos but my feedback isn't any good if you don't fix the product for the next customer."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!  The service was great, bartender Tara was super friendly and so much fun to talk with.  The food was frickin awesome!  You have to try the jalapeño boats, they are better than anything you have ever had!  Oh yeah don't forget the moonshine... especially the blackberry.  Yummers! 

Only negative I could possibly come up with is their fries are not homemade when almost everything else is."}
{"text":"Really good food w gluten free bun options. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, decent prices. Good happy hour options - food and drink"}
{"text":"Had the scorpion burger; it wasn't as hot as I'd expected, but still a very solid burger with good flavor.  Good selection of screens with varying sports.  The moonshine is delicious.  Ambiance would be something that takes me back.  Very relaxed environment with darn good customer service."}
{"text":"Today was my second visit to Copper Still. The staff was very friendly both times. Now the food was fantastic. I'll start by saying that I like my burgers medium. Both times the burgers were cooked to perfection. My wife ordered the \"Flux Capacitor\" and loved it. I had the \"Queso Burger\" and if was a fantastic mess! I have also had the \"Sloppy Jose\" which was very good. The wings are pretty good too. The \"Honey Hot\" is a spicy treat, the \"Medium\" was perfect, and my wife loves the \"PB&J\". We also tried the \"Moonshine Mary\" and it was one of the best Bloody Marys I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Sweet place!   Brand new, and just opened.  Great big bar with a ton of TV's.   Great food and nice Happy Hour Menu.  This is a great place to watch football.  If you get a seat at the huge bar you will barely have to move your neck to watch all games. Not a big moonshine guy but they look interesting.  For all you people from the Tuke like me.   It's worth the 20' cross of I 10 to visit this place.   Patio looks awesome as well.   The only thing I don't like is they are east of I 10"}
{"text":"Mediocre. Oily food at higher than fair prices - 20 bucks spent that felt disappointing. Not a great dining spot, really doesn't deserve a 4 star Yelp average just because it has some tvs and a small selection of draft beers."}
{"text":"They had me at PB and J wings! I love peanut butter anything, but I loved the sweet and savory combo with a good grilled chicken wing. I thought the B&G (baked and grilled) version of the classic wing was good, but could've used a little more char.  I loved my moonshine mule, made with their house moonshine instead of vodka. I appreciated that it was actually served in a copper mug--a lot of restaurants skip this part--and the moonshine added an extra kick. I love a good buzz!  We both had sliders, me the classic and my husband the southern. The southern was nice with the chili and coleslaw added to the traditional burger. Portions were huge and god I'm a sucker for waffle fries, so I really enjoyed my meal. Our waitress was sweet and enthusiastic too. I had a groupon for this first visit, but would gladly pay full price. Good find!"}
{"text":"Yeah, it was karaoke nite. Too loud, horrible singing and the food was sub par. The speakers for the karaoke were on so loud, we couldn't have any conversation at our table. Plus, I was losing my appetite as patrons butchered Rob Thomas songs. We felt like outcasts in this place which probably means its patronized by locals only. I kind of figured this place wasn't exactly the hot spot when I was able to get parking in the front with many more to spare. Don't get the fajitas, they're gross and the portion was a rip off. The burgers were good though."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, great vibe and the staff our extremely friendly! Food was really tasty and you can you door dash to get take out (my taste buds thank door dash also lol). Give them a try, you'll love it"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and the Cu food selections are all good. We have been here several times and the food and service have always been very good, especially when Abby is our server. She is the reason for the 5th star!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and service was amazing. Drinks were really good and they have a good happy hour for drinks. Ordered the chicken artichoke sandwich and it was good. They have tatertots as a side which are always good."}
{"text":"came in on a fri at about 530 and the place was pleasantly busy - good parking and seated immediately at the door.  they do happy hour 3-7p even on Friday, with a decently diverse menu.  moonshine drinks were a little fruity tooty for my taste, but my wife reminded me that not everyone wants to drink straight moonshine out of a pail.  I recommend the grilled Mac and cheese and the front porch because it is whiskey mixed with moonshine and it's the only drink that tastes like alcohol"}
{"text":"There have been many restaurants that have failed at this location so I hope to see this place succeed. Fun moonshine themed bar/restaurant. I ordered the wings (honey hot) and I would say I would go back and eat them again (although the Arizona gold was bland). Moonshine was good as well. Girlfriend ordered the steak sliders, they were decent. The only thing wrong her meal is that the waffle fries tasted like school cafeteria fries. Other then that the only thing I would recommend is to have there happy hour until 7pm :)"}
{"text":"Local brews, fresh food, great service. We had a groupon so we thought we would check it out. We started out with a round of drinks followed by the buffalo bites. The bites were crispy with just enough heat. For the entrees I had the bacon wrapped jalapeño hot dogs and my bride had the Mac n cheese withe jalapeño & chicken. The food came quickly. They both had just enough spice! We are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The food was great, service was super friendly, I enjoyed the little nerdy nods (the elements on the wall, certain food names). 

Went here with my partner, her dad and step mom. We got there about ten minutes after them and they already had drinks and the roasted red pepper hummus. The flat bread with it was good, and I really liked the hummus, but didn't detect a hint of red pepper.

For food:
I got the Flux Capacitor with waffle fries. The patty was big, almost over the sides of the bun, with about medium thickness. It was very juicy, and thankfully still a bit pink in the middle (ordering beef well done is just living life wrong). The waffle fries with it were awesome, finally, somewhere is able to make good waffle fries!

My girlfriend got the bacon cheese burger. According to her is was juicy and yummy. It had an appropriate amount of bacon to cover the burger and that it was not too crispy (though she does say nothing can ever have enough bacon). The was quite a bit of very melted cheddar, which she loved as well. She ordered regular fries. 

The family ordered the steak sliders with onion rings (I had an onion ring, I'd give it about three stars) and a BAT with french onion soup. Neither could finish theirs and took the rest home, so I guess that says they were pretty good, but thats the best details I have there. 

While our server was super friendly, the wait time between our drinks and food was about  45 minutes. She did stop and check on us a few times, and let us know the food would be out soon. The food was hot when we got it, but not sure why it took so long. The place wasn't full, and it was 7pm on a Saturday. 

For drinks we all had domestic beers, so I can't say much about their drink menu. I wish restaurants would let you know their iced tea is the passion flavour and not just  regular brewed iced tea. Maybe its a way to sell drinks, so  you can get that awful taste out of our mouth.

Table was cleared super quick, and we were offered some cheesecake in a mason jar. It looked good, and you could take it home if you were too full, but we were on the way to the movies. Perhaps another time!"}
{"text":"My husband and I drove by this place and finally decided to stop for lunch. I ordered the Alfredo pasta and he ordered the grilled cheese cheeseburger. Mine came out and was a huge portion with garlic bread. But it was terrible! To the point I couldn't even eat it. The chicken was clearly cooked then frozen, it was so rubbery it would have bounced if I threw it on the ground. Even my husband, who's like a garbage disposal said how terrible it was. His burger though was awesome. He offered to trade me but I was already our off so I didn't. It's one of those places we won't go back to unless were meeting someone who's already there, just wasn't impressed with it. Great atmosphere though and our server was ok. Just not worth the money spent"}
{"text":"Great menu and awesome drink specials-I got the sloppy jose which was very flavorful and the grilled veggies were really tasty. Definitely will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Me and the wife came here for our last date in Phoenix. It had a great, chill vibe. We sat at the bar and were greeted by a friendly bartender named Ben. Super knowledgeable in his craft, absolutely polite and a pleasure to make acquaintance with. He walked me through the different types of whiskeys to try and whipped up an awesome drink for my wife. We had the chipotle tacos which were great, and the wings and Jalepeno boats were awesome as well. Would definitely come again for the environment and Bens awesome recommendations and friendly vibe. Thanks for turning me on to my new favorite Whiskey!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner on a Monday night and couldn't have had a better dinner. It's definitely a sports bar atmosphere that's decorated perfectly! Monday nights special is wings. 50 cent wings with great sauce choices, but only have bone-in wings. They do have a baked option though if you are trying to stay somewhat healthy. I had the grilled cheese burger. Oh so good! I would definitely recommend it. I've had this burger other places and this one was better. It only has two pieces of bread instead of 4 so for me was much more manageable to eat. 

The only turn off I had was I felt nickeled and dimed when the bill came. Extra for a tomato and onion on a burger? And then their drink special was $3 moonshine but charged extra to have it on the rocks. Extra for ice? Seems a little ridiculous. I'm not cheap by any means but just rubbed me the wrong way. 

It isn't something that will keep me from coming back because our waitress was fantastic and the food was so good, but I just can't give it 5 stars... At least yet"}
{"text":"New place only been open since after 
Thanksgiving but man if you haven't tried it You are missing out delicious delicious food, cold cold beer, moonshine, bomb ass drinks, come try it..."}
{"text":"Great place to have some drinks and watch sports. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Food was good too."}
{"text":"Stopped for drinks and appetizers Friday around 9 pm. Employees were friendly and helpful. The appetizers were good and the draft beer selection was decent. The overall atmosphere was a little less than expected. Very tired and outdated neighborhood bar theme. The men's room was awful. There was water all over the floor and both urinals were out of order. Not sure we will go back there again."}
{"text":"Copper Still is a gem! We have drove past this restaurant hundreds of times! Twice a day!!
The reviews appealed to us on just the right day at just the right time! 
MAN! 
The wings! So yummy and flavorful with perfect amount of crunch. We ordered the wings naked with several sauces so we could find our perfect flavor. 'Arizona Gold' killed it.
I prefer mine with bleu cheese, but the ranch was also a score! 
The French onion soup is a hard pass next time but it was a cool, cloudy day and soup sounded perfect. 
The jalapeño boats caught my eye for our next venture here. Great bar, great food!"}
{"text":"Really solid! The sloppy Jose was amazing. Good drinks, nice service. We stayed because there was trivia. All together great and we will be back for sure to watch football!"}
{"text":"Very good hamburger cooked to order, however,  requested no tomato and it came with it anyway.   Terrible service would make me think twice about returning."}
{"text":"So, I'm normally not a moonshine person but the way they can mix these drinks, makes it pretty dangerous because they are just that delicious. They also have a pretty good food selection. Recommend the grilled cheese burger, they also have a Scorpion cheese burger that comes with jalapenos and jalapeno mayo if you want something with an additional kick.
Only thing I've noticed after numerous visits is, that the service isn't so good, you kinda have to have time to kill because you will see rarely see your server and be uncomfortable when you ask another server to get you another drink.
But, food and Karaoke Saturdays ensure that it will still be a great time."}
{"text":"Had the grilled cheese burger with waffle fries. Food was average and service was average. Will come back."}
{"text":"Let's see.  This place was ok.  Not bad but nothing great either.  Wouldn't say I won't go back, but won't go out of my way either to come back.  
Was hoping with the name there would be something special and unique about it. And although they do try and focus their drinks around moonshine; they don't have their own brand as just use Old Smokeys moonshine. Which is fine, I guess I just expected more. 
The decor seemed a bit confusing as wasn't sure if they just want to be like every other bar with typical beer signs or more nostalgic with pictures of copper stills and unique art.  Overall wasn't impressed and was left desiring more!   Just meh!!"}
{"text":"Read about the scorpion burger and had to try - it packed some heat but a really good burger!  They have a wing special on Mondays and our server said they are big and delicious- will be back to try the wings.  Our server was awesome and went over menu questions and could describe the beers in excellent detail.  Good food & service- will be back"}
{"text":"This place is really neat! The food was good, my grilled wings were slightly over cooked but my boyfriend's grilled cheese burger was super tasty! They have a great happy hour and boyfriend loves bourbon. They have some great selections from local distilleries and they have $3 bourbons during happy hour on Wed! We will be sure to check this place out again soon."}
{"text":"It's Sunday evening.  I'm visiting from Buffalo NY with my friends who live here in Chandler.  We came because the positive reviews.  

The place is half full, but the kitchen and staff are struggling to keep delivery to a reasonable time frame.  The waitress so terribly annoying.  Everything she says is 'we' and 'us', and literally after EVERYTHING someone says she has to tack on a comment.  'oh good choice'. ''thats great'. 'we can definitely do that'. Etc.

They forgot to being us our nachos appetizer.  The Philly Phoenix sandwich was lukewarm, overseasoned meat and nothing special.  The roll tasted like it came from the supermarket yesterday.  The fish tacos were meh.  The nacho chips that came with the tacos were overdone.  Very little basil in the Tomato Basil soup.  

Even the thirteen year old with us commented how poor the service was.

What an underwhelming way to end my vacation."}
{"text":"Went the other night for trivia and had a GREAT experience!! We noticed peanut butter and jelly flavored wings on the menu and HAD to at least try half a dozen...surprisingly, they were REALLY good! Would definitely get them again!! We also tried the honey hot wings which were delicious and an appetizer called 'devil bites'. Creamy, rich, and amazing!!! We ended up winning third place in trivia and got a $10 gift card to use that night, BONUS! Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I tried Moonshine when they first opened and the food was very bland.  I just gave it another try and it was very good.  I had the sloppy joe,the flavor with a little spice is very yummy. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Relatively new local joint close to home.  Nice decor on the inside!  Very clean.  Wait staff was good, but not great.  Now on to the food and drinks.  B and G wings were tasty.  Carne asada tacos were ok.  Steak salad was good.  They serve a good variety of local micro brews.  Need to come back for some 'shine and copper mule!  Nice place,  we will be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent service and delicious food!!! Especially loved the bbq flatbread, which was recommended by our server!"}
{"text":"I ordered the turkey sandwich with grilled vegetables on the side. I would definitely order it again. The turkey is prepared and roasted on site. It is served on toasted bread with cheese, avacado and a delicious cranberry mayo. The grilled veggies were also delicious. I'm looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"We come here on Friday and Saturday nights. We love it! As a former bartender this place is awesome. I've sat outside, inside, or at the bar. On a Saturday night you can get a Shannon to serve you and have a good time. They have the best apple moonshine I've ever tasted. Would tell any friend to come here for a good time."}
{"text":"Uh, Yeah--ok. You should go here!

It's a bar in *your* neighborhood. You can go there and have a beer that matches your tastes and style. Also the food is available and tastes!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the 1st time tonight. It was my wife, our 2 kids and I. Atmosphere was good but I have a feeling it's a different experience whether you are in the dining room or the bar. With our 2 young kids we were in the dining room and our waitress paid more attention to those sitting at the bar then she did to us. The beer selection was good as it has both Four Peaks and San Tan local brews on tap. Food was ok.. I had the Steak Phoenix sandwich and my wife had a burger. My wife enjoyed the burger my sandwich was so so, bread tastes a little stale. If I'm going without the kids and can sit at the bar I will definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"Always busy... but there is a reason for that!  Great food!  Great service, especially Shannon.  She is super friendly and and always offers great food suggestions!
We love it here."}
{"text":"My wife found this place just by doing a local search.  Its a nice, local sports bar/ pub with great food and great drinks.  I just ordered wings, but was able to split up the sauces for no extra charge.  I got the hottest sauce on the menu and the Arizona gold.  The hot sauce had great flavor but was not overwhelming hot.  The Arizona gold sauce was a little too sweet for me, but I have not had anything like it so it was good to try once (and its made in house).  My wife had the grilled cheese-cheeseburger.  It was off the charts good.  basically a cheeseburger between two grilled cheeses... how can that not be good.  This place has nice happy hour pricing as well (I think 5 bucks for a tall craft beer draft).  They specialize in moonshine drinks, so the wife got a punch flavored drink and it was pretty good, not overwhelming with corn liquor harshness.  

Overall, this place is great for any type of visit and we plan on going back to watch some of our favorite sports teams on one of the many TVs they have."}
{"text":"Dined here last night for the first time.
It was about 8: 00 PM. Our server was Abby. She had a very laid back personality everything was \"cool & awesome\".. LOL. Abby's service was fine, food average.
Beers on tap a plus. Moonshine is what this place is \"know for\" so I had the Ginger Moonshine Mule. Very strong taste of ginger. I like ginger, but I had a difficult time getting this drink down.
Started with the chicken wings. Tried to go the \"healthier version\" of what they offer. Got the baked wings instead of fried. Big mistake-baked & then charbroiled to finish them off. These wings were burnt tasting & offered no real taste experience of the two sauces (Hot & Az Gold) we requested them tossed in. The wings were burnt to a crisp on the outer  skin, yet tender on the inside. Found it difficult to get through that excessively charred taste- overwhelming & disappointing!
Jalapeño Boats are stuffed with cream cheese & bacon. Then dipped in a beer batter & fried. Sadly, I had to send the first order back after trying the first one. Batter extremely thick, soft, underdone & doughy. I requested to have them fried a little long. Next batch-didn't come out much different? Sorta bland tasting really! That beer batter (to me) is a just to heavy. Not a light crunchy batter I'm use to-like a tempura. I think they would be decent if they changed it up to a consistency like that?
The burger was decent & cook the medium well way in which was requested. Garlic fries are truly garlicky. Made with fresh minced garlic sprinkled on top of some seasoned crispy fries with a little bacon, green onion & grated cheese. Those were probably the best thing about the night.
Regrettably, we don't think we will return. It was just average in food, flavor and service."}
{"text":"I really liked how easy it was to park here.  I ordered the Punch Hunch Love drink and it was good.  For dinner I ordered the \"grilled cheeseburger\" and it came on sourdough bread. It was very good.  I also ordered the waffle fries and they were just okay.  The customer service was decent."}
{"text":"All I have to say is: B & G honey hot wings. My god. These wings blow all wings in town out the water. Short for baked and grilled, these wings are complete with a crispy outside and kissed with a nice char from the grill. We originally planned on having an appetizer before our entree, but after the first round of wings we had to have a second. Seriously. They're so good we said to hell with an entree, these are the entree! We also tried the Arizona gold wings and hot wings but the honey hot just couldn't be beat. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Awesome beer taps. Can't wait to have my grilled cheeseburger and tots. Enjoying the Huss coffee kolsch."}
{"text":"Gilbert needed a place like this! Great Moscow Mules and a nice variety of menu items. Great service the two times I have been here and a patio with tv's. A patio is always a plus! Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Great little brewery in Chandler. Was surprised about the quality of the food. It was really good. Service was OK. Orders took extremely long to get. Even forgot my drink order. But overall not bad. You should check it out if you're in the Chandler area. Not as good as the tilted kilt, as in the scenery, but I thought the food was better."}
{"text":"The moonshine drinks are great, specials are awesome.

As far as food goes, it's just ok. The garlic fries are alright and the chicken tacos are pretty good. 

I'd go back for drinks but I don't think I'd pick this place to eat."}
{"text":"I ordered through GrubHub, so I cannot comment on the service or state of the restaurant. My review will be purely for the food. 

I got the Sloppy Jose - and it was so good! The flavor was amazing and the pork chorizo was tender. Whoever came up with that recipe deserves an award. The fries were mediocre, though. Had a couple and didn't want the rest. At least the burger made up for it."}
{"text":"Had the chipotle chicken tacos, which had good flavor. They were a little cool so I just had them warm them up some, not a big deal. It would also be nice if they uses cabbage instead of lettuce on these as some of their other tacos so. I will go back though."}
{"text":"This place has incredible food! The menu is creative, which is refreshing for a neighborhood bar. I have eaten several of their burgers, salads and appetizers and have loved everything I've ordered. Prices are also great for the quality of the food served."}
{"text":"Had the Philly cheese tandoori flatbread. Don't be afraid of it!!  It's awesome!!  The bread is fluffy like naan......oh so yummy!!!  Chorizo sloppy Joe was zippy and tasty!

Great atmosphere and service!!  Will go again!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Talia has been my server the last 2 times and does her job well. Tried the Mac and cheese after reading a previous review. Delicious!! Food is great. Grilled medium wings are fantastic too. Must!check!this!place!out!!!:)"}
{"text":"Had great reviews and a coupon, so I tried Cu still. I went in on a Friday night around 7. Every table had a party seated. 

I order the baked and grilled wings, a scorpion burger with waffle fries, and a bacon avocado tomato grilled cheese sandwich with garlic fries. 

The wings came charred black. After one wing I sent them back; they were all crispy black. The waiter offered to have them redone correctly but that carcinogenic burnt taste in my mouth lingered for a long time an I was done with wings. 

Burger was a home made patty. Not medium but juicy. Small patty, there was plenty of just bun and lettuce bites to my burger. 

Grilled cheese came cold with some of the cheese not even melted. Not much bacon, especially for 8$, and I guess it was my mistake for thinking a mushy avocado would be good on grilled cheese. Completely missed the mark.

Garlic fries were bleh. Not good. The waffle fries on the other hand were awesome. 

I really wanted to like this place. I had good service from my waiter Nick. Nice atmosphere with big booths. Maybe I'll give this place one more chance in a few months on a time when it's empty to get the mushroom burger and Phoenix sandwich which looked good, but not likely."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try Copper Still for a while, but for some reason never pulled the trigger. Finally tried it tonight. Burger was solid and a good size. Good beer selection. My girlfriend had the French onion grilled cheese. Pretty much what you'd expect; lots of delicious cheese and onions. She seemed to enjoy it. Great menu selections, too. We'll be back to try more."}
{"text":"Used the enjoy going to Copper Still Moonshine Grill but the last two experiences have been terrible. As someone with a food allergy, ordering food can be a challenge sometimes because there is always the risk of your order not being correct. This is the second time this place has made my food wrong. This time, I sent my food back and asked that it be taken off the bill. Our waitress then brought out the bill with my food on it. She wasn't to blame for the food, but she should have double checked the bill before brining it to the table. Bad kitchen staff and from all of our experiences, bad wait staff. We wont be back!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now ... first time was about drinking beer and visiting with a friend. Food was underwhelming at best but didn't think too much of it; could have been an off night. I can appreciate poor bar food when it's priced accordingly but they seem to be pretty proud of their very mediocre food. 
Second time tonight was about dinner and not a bit better. I watched the cook put our order in the window/ring the bell and our server walk by it twice while screwing around with co workers for over 3 minutes. Only 3 minutes you say?!? That's a long time for a grossly over cooked chicken Swiss mushroom sandwich. So soggy on the bottom but plenty warm. Ate less than 1/2. Husband (who has an iron stomach!!) ordered a blue cheese burger and I'm pretty sure has a case of food poisoning that would hospitalize me! Service was friendly but painfully slow/disorganized & beer was cold but that seems to be the best they can do. Don't think we'll be back.."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch today ... no drinks. Food was great for bar food and they have wifi. I had the chicken poblano penne pasta and it was pretty darn good for $11... very impressed."}
{"text":"Great menu with a variety of choices. The service is what really stood out. A number of servers checked our beverages, cleared dishes and supported each other's customers. Great team effort and really made us feel appreciated."}
{"text":"Excellent! Love this place! First time here was awesome. The Pickle Fries are not our traditional fried pickles. They are shaped like fries. They're seasoned very well. The fries are excellent as is the grilled cheese burger. Service was excellent as our waiter was very friendly, efficient and accommodating."}
{"text":"Fab food and staff. Can't say enough great things about this place. The owners are always around and the entire staff is just great. Especially Abby, Hayden and Ethan. :)"}
{"text":"9:15 p.m. on a Monday night amd we were seated mediately by hostess.  Too bad she wasn't the wait staff as well.  12 minutes later we still sat with our menus and no wait staff to be seen anywhere.  Not even a drink order was taken.

Decided to leave & on the way out both the hostess and a waitress told us to have a good night.  Pretty clueless!
It wasn't busy and Bengals vs. Broncos was on.  We've enjoyed ourselves here before but probably won't go back now or recommend it.  Sad.  :("}
{"text":"First time came bartenders awesome....2nd Time Food sucked so bad.....it was over fried and dry....server was nice but never around...when we left he was on Patio talking with friends as tables were dirty inside...He waved and said bye and thank you for coming then pulled up a chair to sit with the Friends on the patio....we left a tip but really considered going back in and taking it back....we didn't but won't be back....one plus tho .....the beer was sooooo cold and quite fresh and tasty~!
Also place was Tooooo bright~!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! Everything about tonight was wonderful at the newest Copper Still Moonshine Grill in Chandler! 

We have a 1yr old daughter and going out to eat can be tough sometimes, between food options to environment. Tonight I realized that phenomenal service can really make a difference! 

We had Trevor tonight and he was just fantastic! Catch him behind the bar during the week and serving on the weekends. He always seemed so happy to see us at our table, was so kind, so attentive and gave the best food recommendations! From the soft pretzel with beer cheese and mustard appetizer to the turkey sandwich (yes they roast the turkey and carve it thinly in house!) the food was amazing! I got grilled veggies to cut up for my daughter and he made some magic happen and helped us get some more zucchini... extra cooked! 

This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"What a great local restaurant. ..I have been going for a while and love the staff....food is good typical menu for a restaurant/bar I suggest the flat bread, chicken sliders, and pickle fries....I am not a wing guy but all my friends and other customers say they have great flavors....plenty of tvs and trivia, touch screen, and golden tee...Friday nights right now is group trivia night which is awesome. ..sat is karaoke .. also do great bus trips/events...prices are god and have a great happy hour....owners are there and they work which is different from most and are very friendly...I do agree with others on the decor is a little confusing buy not there to look at that anyways...."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar-locally owned.  Plenty of tv's for all sports.  Large selection of drinks; local beers on draft; many varieties of moonshine and lots of house/specialty drinks.  Try the Copper Mule.  Friendly attentive staff- took care of my party of 14 recently.   Everyone had a great time.  Food- try the queso burger.  Many unique items worth trying along with wings/salads/burgers.   Best fries in town."}
{"text":"Liked the atmosphere. Has a patio with misters. Great service. I had the cheese burger sliders with sweet potato fries and a side of cole slaw. Burgers were good, but my fries were overcooked and slaw was just ok. She had the pulled pork sandwich. BBQ sauce was great and the bun was deliciously toasted. Caesar salad was too vinegary."}
{"text":"Love the jalapeño popper grilled cheese and garlic fries! Service is great too. Only thing missing was some jalapeño jelly (or something similar) to dip my spicy sandwich."}
{"text":"Bartender was fun to talk to. Moonshine flights were fun!! The jalapeño poppers appetizer is SO DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful,  great service and awesome food.   French onion soup really good without being to salty."}
{"text":"The first visit was well worth it and we will be coming back.   

I had the French onion soup.   I'm not always a fan of ordering this soup because it usually is too salty for my taste, but that is not the case at Copper Still.  It was Wonderful!

I'm not a big drinker but there were 2 different flights at our table.   The beer and the moonshine was enjoyed immensely by the rest of the group.  Raspberry moonshine was the winner.

The service was stellar.  We sat outside on a pretty cool late  evening,  without any other guests around.   We were NOT forgotten as is a typical problem in other restaurants.  They spend a lot of time making sure you have everything you need, frequent table visits, drinks are kept full and most important IMO,  prompt removal of the dirty dishes!  The server knows the menu and even offered a sample of the wing sauce we did not order.  

Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"7 of us came here to watch a game. We called to see if there was a wait and were informed that there were 2 open booths. We arrived 7 min later as we were nearby. The booths were taken and it's a first come, first serve policy. I'm OK with that. Then they told us we could have asked to reserve the booth when we called. Well, why didn't they present that option on the phone when we called? That would have been an opportunity to display excellent customer service but instead resulted in disappointment upon arrival.

We ended up sitting outside as we chose to tolerate the cold rather than miss the game. They had heat lamps so that was nice. They did have room to place a couple more. I'd recommend the investment as I saw someone not sitting close to a heat lamp using a Snuggie. Not exactly an environment or visual a sports bar wants to create. 

I ordered a $9 grilled cheese. Now, I never have low or high expectations of a grilled cheese. It's hard to screw it up. The taste was as expected. My comments have more to do with the value proposition. This grilled cheese costs $5-6 at most places. I was expecting a larger quantity or size for the price since quality was likely to be standard. Nope, just standard two slices of bread and American cheese for $9. Will not be ordering again due to the value. Might as well get a burger with a side. Recommend the restaurant evaluate the pricing.

I also ordered tomato basil soup as did a couple others. It came out lukewarm and should have been hot. I imagine they waited until everyone's food was ready, which resulted in reduced quality for those who ordered soup. I didn't ask them to remake it or microwave it. It had already been 30 min since we ordered and I wanted to eat my grilled cheese with my soup. Timing and pairings matter. Recommend the restaurant check the soup temperature prior to serving and even better, ask the customer at the time of order how warm they want the soup.

The table also ordered two moonzookies (pizza cookie dessert). Generally, pizza cookies are at worst, average, and at best, delicious. Everyone agreed this recipe was below average. Recommend the restaurant change recipes as 4 pizza cookie lovers all disliked the dessert.

I tried someone else's waffle fries and regular fries. Both were crispy and good.

Overall, there is a lot of improvement to be made depending on the item from value proposition (grilled cheese) to quality (soup temperature, moonzookie) to service (customer communication before arrival).

I advise businesses for a living. Would be happy to do a business assessment as I love seeing local businesses thrive."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner today right before the dinner rush. We had the beef nachos as an appetizer which were average, nothing unique or special about them. I had the chicken quesadillas and a side of onion rings for the entree. The onion rings were awesome and the quesadillas were good. 

I was a little confused on the service. We had someone greet us and take our orders but then had multiple people drop off our items and clear our table, etc. Very nice people just different then what I usually encounter at a restaurant. 

**There was a wait for a table at around 6 pm and parking lot was super full when we left**"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and fresh made!! Love the variety of sandwiches!! I had the turkey with bacon avocado and cranberry mayo!! Amazing taste!! Will be coming back here!! Also excellent and friendly service!!!"}
{"text":"... I had this place marked to try for the last couple of months, I finally got their tonight. Easy to get to, right off the 10... Chandler exit. Good layout, sports bar feel with lots of screens. Service was perfect level of attentive but not smothering. Staff really new the food and had suggestions. 
Food was a pleasant surprise, they have all the classics but with a twist that took our selections to that next level. 
Shrimp tacos were spicy with nice fat grilled shrimp, very good!  We also had the grilled cheese burger, as suggested by staff... that one is a real winner!  Garlic fries were awesome, hot and fresh... make sure your entire party eats them.... they don't call them \"garlic\" fries for nothing!  Looking forward to another visit !"}
{"text":"We had a Chandler Chamber of Commerce event at the Copper Still Moonshine Grill this evening and with over 100 members present I cannot say enough about the service of this establishment. Even the owner Chuck came by and introduced himself. Food was fabulous and we will definitely be back. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The service was atrocious and the food even worse.  It took two hours. We ordered the Bavarian pretzel dry and out of box. Beef and blue had over cooked mystery meat. The fish tacos were fried batter with no fish. Pulled pork was dry and bread on philly steak was as hard as a hickey puck.  The one good plate were the chicken wings."}
{"text":"Nice family friendly place.
There was a wine/paint night going on.  
This place has the best pickle fries!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Staff is friendly,  service is great and the food is on point.   Our favorite happy hour spot."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time today! Trevor was our server and was awesome! Food was great, I had wings and my boyfriend had the steak sliders. All of the staff were very attentive and ready to help if needed. :)"}
{"text":"Only went in for a drink before having dinner next door at Sushiya.  I must say that I am looking forward to coming back.  The place was spacious, they had great specials on drinks, and the manager was very helpful.  Plus it smelled like good food.  I had the Sucker Punch, and it did not disappoint.  I like sweet drinks, so it was perfect.  It packed a bit of a punch.  I'm a bit of a lightweight when it comes to drinking.  I will be back for another sucker punch and to try the food!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great selection of drinks made to perfection, and a plethora of good grub."}
{"text":"Just wrote a tip.  The food is great.  Service not so much.    Couldn't get ice tea refill.  Time to stop and take care of tables. :/"}
{"text":"DON'T COMPLAIN OR THE MANAGER WILL TELL YOU NOT TO COME BACK!    I ordered my 3 year old kids mac & cheese, which was just the boxed kind.  When it came it was mostly crusty dried noodles with burnt clumps.  I told the waiter.  After about 5 minutes we got back what seemd to be the same bowl minus the crusty stuff I took out.  (Bowl was 1/2 full & cold.)  When I told the waiter again he sent the manager.  When I told him about it, he got nasty & told me not to come back.  That got me totally worked up!  As we walked out the door I told him he was a certain part of anatony for being that way over a 3 year olds' meal, he basically cursed us out the door.  DON'T GO UNLESS YOU ARE WISHY-WASHY & NEVER COMPLAIN.  

It was shameful!"}
{"text":"Grilled wings and garlic fries are awesome!  Service was great too.  Nice patio with TV's and plenty of sun shades and heaters.  Good happy hour specials.  Chuck the manager stopped by to check on us as well, nice fella."}
{"text":"I had a Groupon for this restaurant. Their happy hour is great and I was impressed with their drink menu. I got the hummus and a moonshine cocktail. My husband got fish and chips, a tall moonshine and a beer. We enjoyed everything and the Groupon covered almost all of the check. The service was excellent. The only thing we were disappointed about was the limited vegetarian options and the fries didn't agree with my husband (he has multiple food allergies and they aren't available unseasoned)."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Went here for lunch for the first time as we had an Entertainment book coupon. Friendly server and awesome pub food. Got the buffalo bites, B.A.T. Grilled cheese sandwich and Fish & Chips. Waffle and regular fries were awesome. Owner/manager even came by and gave us some more coupons to return. Happy to find this place!"}
{"text":"Great good, great service, and nice atmosphere!!!  For a bar type restaurant this place is spot on with their food!!!  Beef and blues salad, BBQ pork, wings, burgers, and fries are delicious!!!  Try to come in at least once a month..."}
{"text":"So good! BBQ chicken flatbread...shut the front door! Steak sliders...so yum. Service...couldn't ask for better. Kitchen closed in 2 min, server was patient, made excellent recommendations, got our order in and food was out fast. We\"ll be baaaack!"}
{"text":"I love this place! My wife and I go at least once a week and just last weekend did the party bus trip to the Cardinals game. They do something new every few months which makes it a great way to meet old friends and make new ones."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner w/ the bf.. 

It's super close to my house which is already a plus. I ordered the Chicken Sliders. This comes with chicken, avocado, bacon, cheese and spicy mayo. It was good accept I think it needed more of the spicy mayo because it was a bit dry for my taste. I got the waffle fries for my side. & they were amazing! My boyfriend got onion rings for his side which I got to try. I'm not a huge fan of onion rings but they were probably some of the best onion rings I've ever had. For my drink I ordered the Strawberry Peach White Sangria. I don't drink moonshine so it definitely had an acquired taste to it. 

I really want to come back to do their happy hour. They have happy hour pretty much everyday except for Saturdays and they also have daily specials as well. Everything looked very reasonably priced so I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Me and my friends went on a Monday night to celebrate my buddy's going away for a few months. The lady who served us wasn't too enthused to be serving our table and no one greeted us when we came in.

They had a poker game going which I thought was cool. Food was over-priced for sure something like $12 for chicken fingers. We just shared the chips and 3 dip since it was so pricey. Bar food should never be more than $10. Beer was pricey too and not that cold.

I was hoping for a cool neighborhood divey bar but it didn't meet any of my expectations in any category.. will be going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Garlic fries were WAY too greasy and had far too much garlic on them. My Philly cheesesteak was pretty bad. Had an odd flavor from whatever they marinated the rubbery meat in and the veggies had no flavor. The iced tea was that flowery tasting stuff so avoid that too."}
{"text":"Sports bar. Fridy afternoon happy hour with less than attentive service.  Good size portions of entrees. Burger was ordered to hold the tomato, but it was still served on it, anyway. Harvest salad with grilled chicken and oriental sesame dressing was very delicious."}
{"text":"Nice little spot stopped in to have a beer and a bite while waiting for nail appointment close by clean nice friendly service a little pricy but can't easily to try happy hour"}
{"text":"We felt like we were pretty far south from anything we knew, so we looked this place up.  It was karaoke night and they say us righhhhht next to speakers.  (We didn't know this when we first sat down). The staff started setting up and there they were, the blaring sound of  each person belting it out.

The plates we ordered were just appetizers  - I got the dry rub wings and I love dry rub wings - so I can say these were just meh.  Moscow mules were alright too.  Just the staff here seemed soooo rushed and we never had just one person that came by frequently which I think they probably have have a handle on now.

Thinking about the experience, I dunno if we would come back."}
{"text":"This place was an awesome find! The menu is large with pretty much anything you would want to eat... the food was delicious!The environment was very friendly and the staff was great! Chuck, the owner, came out and visited with us for awhile, he was very personable and friendly. I love supporting guys like Chuck and places like Copper Still Moonshine Grill. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! They have many different options from salads, to wings to burgers, to several different kinds of grilled cheese. They also have fantastic cocktails! The service is always good, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"I tried it a while ago and loved it. I've gone back multiple times and always left happy. I've liked everything I've ordered off their menu, from their grilled cheese sandwiches to their bbq honey chicken wings (which i highly recommend). 

The service is wonderful and its got a great atmosphere. Plus I love their outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice and have always had great service. Ordered the Fish n' Chips last time and there are only two pieces, which seems like a rip-off.  However, the Scorpion Burger is really good and my girlfriend says the veggie burger is actually really good! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went to lunch with my mom.  I had the Popper grilled cheese sandwich.  It was absolutely great.  I've never had cream cheese on a grilled cheese.  Every ingredient was fresh.  My mom had the bat grilled chess and loved it.  The best thing about the place was the service.  I believe our waitress name was Meghan.  She was so nice and attended to our every need before we even asked.  Food was good, but service even better!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night on way back from Case Grande historic site. Glad we did. After a beer and a moonshine flight we ordered what turned out to be very good food.  Erica was an awesome server too!  Nice place which we will return to."}
{"text":"Great little find. The food was good. We had the B&G wings and the Jalapenos. B&G wings were my favorite. Wine was tasty and the prices were very reasonable for happy hour.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere super yummy food... Try The tomato soup with pita bread so delicious!"}
{"text":"We gave this place a try b/c, well, Teakwoods has really been going downhill.

What this place really lacks is an identity.  We couldn't figure the place out.

I had the Scorpion burger, which was really good.  Fresh jalapenos, cooked perfectly, excellent bun.

The chicken wings are good but aren't 'Buffalo' flavored -- more southwest flavored.

Small beer selection, but they make up for that with the locals: Four Peaks and San Tan.

Overall, not bad, more 'meh,' but didn't do enough (likely) to get us back there."}
