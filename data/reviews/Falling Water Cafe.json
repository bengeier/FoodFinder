{"text":"Ate here three times while staying at the Marriott. Lovely setting, the food is quite good, but the service is so terrible I can't give the place a good review. Twice they were understaffed. The first time we ate here the lone waitress was seating people too. But there were several bartenders that weren't the least bit busy. The next time there was only one waitress, and she had a certain \"section\" in the spacious place, so they kept seating everyone along one banquette. We were sitting on top of each other while the rest of the place was empty. And the kitchen got the order wrong. The last time the staff was terribly inattentive. Our waiter was so busy chatting with the bartender he didn't see us trying to get his attention for 10 minutes. The food took forever and the kitchen got this order wrong also. This place needs a good manager!   Good food and a nice dining area isn't enough if your guests are frustrated by horrible service."}
{"text":"Ordered room service- the salmon salad- it was missing ingredients listed on menu. Also ordered a glass of la crema Pinot noir and I am positive that they served a less expensive alternative based on the extremely sour taste. Would not recommend unless desperate for food."}
{"text":"***This restaurant and its breakfast buffet do not feel fresh (kind of like this Marriott, which has a very outdated decor); the breakfast buffet featured a good variety of items--bacon, sausage, breakfast, potatoes, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, cereal, pastries, oatmeal, and an omelet bar; the food was not horrible, but a lot of it was salty; the poor lighting in the lobby (this is an open lobby restaurant) probably made the food feel worse than it actually was; service was pleasant***  This Marriott has its own free self parking lot."}
{"text":"The breakfast buffet was $14 and I checked it out. I did not think the selections warranted my money.  However, I had to eat there for lunch. I was at an event where I could not leave. Day one: Cheeseburger with a side salad. WOW! For $12 you sure get your money's worth. The burger was huge, I could not finish it. The salad was a FULL side salad that needed its own plate. Everything was cooked well and the flavors were spot on.   The service was fantastic.   Day 2 lunch: Tomato soup with grilled cheese. This is one of their menu pairing. My only complaint?  I could have used a little more sandwich. The portion was a touch small for $10. However, the flavors were amazing. I just wanted to inhale the whole meal."}
{"text":"Had room service for dinner. Typical hotel food, nothing amazing. I had the three dip appetizer. It came with a few artichoke slices that were pretty good. The hummus was flavorless. I'm not sure what the last dip was but it was not good. The pita seemed like it had been sitting out all day. I also got the tomato mozzetta salad. Not bad but also not breath taking. Staff is so incredibly friendly though:)"}
{"text":"ate here tonight because i'm staying at the Marriott Madison West, and this is the restaurant within the hotel.  great chilled shrimp app, with horseradish-like remoulade, and cocktail sauce. there were only four, although big, but definitely not enough for a few people.  also had their app of sausage flatbread - YUM!!  great local beers here and they change it looks like a lot. had a wonderful spotted cow! will try some other things before my departure probably, so i'll report back. full bar also."}
{"text":"When you have a full house at the hotel this restaurant is at due to a convention, having a full wait staff is critical! No one was at the check in table and there was no one around for at least 15 minutes. It took another guest to tell us that we needed to go to the bar and order, as there were no wait staff, only bussers. Spent another 15 minutes at the bar just to get a menu. The menu had 3 entr√©es on it; a cheeseburger, a TBLT, and a Caesar salad. That's it. I haven't even had the chance to eat the food yet. This hotel restaurant is stunningly understaffed for a crowd of over 1000 guests.  My wife ordered a grilled cheese with tomato soup, both were cold. My Caesar salad was OK, but it's hard to mess that up."}
