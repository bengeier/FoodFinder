{"text":"If you are in terminal A this place is great. My hubs had the poutine with braised beef and he says it was excellent. I had the peanut butter and bacon w banana appetizer. Oh. My. Lord. It was absolutely delish. Definitely something I have never seen on any menu anywhere. It is heaven if you are into sweet and savory food combinations. My son had the grilled cheese, that was just regular and it was a slice of american processed cheese. A slice of any other cheese that was actual real cheese would have been better for an adult. It comes with a tomato soup. But overall, great place to eat."}
{"text":"Pretty bad, even for an airport bar, the only reason they have customers is because they are one of the few bars (if not the only bar) in this section of terminal 3.  Waiters display attitude, food is very questionable, and if you are not getting the service from your waiter and ask another waiter for help, they will make a point of calling your original waiter rather than serving you.  I really hope some of this feedback gets to them eventually and they either change or get replaced by another brand.  I agree on the comment about eating at the bar though, it did look very friendly and fast. Just make a few steps forward to get 14, and you will find a perfect alternative, excellent and fast service and great food.  Don't settle for this urban bar if you don't have to."}
{"text":"Don't do it. Especially if your plane leaves in one hour or less. The service is slow af and the menu choices are limited: \"salad\" with iceberg lettuce; fried things; a burger. Nothing healthy at all.   I got the braised beef sliders. You get two sliders and fries. The fries were good and the sliders were probably the best choice on the menu, but the service here is so slow that I just cannot, in good conscience, recommend this place AT ALL.   An airport eatery needs to be, first and foremost, fast. People have planes to catch and can't sit around for 10 minutes waiting for a menu and another 20 minutes waiting for the check. Save yourself the stress and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Landed after a long flight only to self seat our selves and wait 5 minutes with absolutely no service. The 2 people at the bar were too busy chatting about hockey rather than serve anyone. Try the pork and pickle restaurant. We went there and had above average service."}
{"text":"I ordered a burger with a side Caesar salad. I was warned the burger would take 15 minutes. It took 30 minutes from ringing in the order to receiving my food, at a time when there was only one other food order, placed 15 minutes after mine. In an airport this is just unacceptable. The servers was apologetic as they charged me the full price for my meal.  The burger was excellent. Great meat, great bun, good toppings. I wish I'd had more time to enjoy it!  The side Caesar was lettuce tossed lightly in kraft Caesar dressing and dusted with powdered Parmesan. No other ingredients - as basic as it gets, and not even close to what I hoped for a $3.50 upgrade charge from the side it comes with."}
{"text":"Disappointing... Cool name, cool concept, but seriously marginal airport food. The soba noodle \"salad\" had a few yellow and green peppers and scallions. Not good."}
{"text":"Food served on newspaper is a bad idea, especially when eating eggs. Didn't help that half my food was cold either, even after sending it back. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the worst restaurants (and I'm not sure it deserves that title) I've ever tried to eat at. Service is slow and bad. The food is rubbish, grilled cheese with processed, semi-melted cheese and bland greasy tomato soup. Do not eat here. You'll regret it."}
{"text":"The service here is horrible. I ordered to go and was asked to wait by the side. So I went to their side area where the tables are located and the waitress in charge of the tables looked at me with disdain and told me to get out of that area. I told her I just had ordered and she told me the seating wasn't for me. Mind you there were at least 6 empty tables that seat at least 4 people there and there were only 10 people using the bar area and 3 other tables. This is also a place that is open seating so why would she be so bothered by me just sitting in one of the many open tables. She could have asked me nicely. Instead she was rude and condescending. It's not like they have a sign indicating it's only dine-in seating. Also this is located in the airport it's not some fancy restaurant. It's over priced average food. $14 for a grilled cheese that looks and taste worse than what I make at home. Avoid this place. Go to the burger place just a couple gates over instead."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and quick. But the salad, if I can call it that, was so poor. Cut up ice berg lettuce with ranch, fried chicken, and tomatoes. What am I, a picky 4-year old kid? Crap American fast food style."}
{"text":"Good food and good service! The staff was friendly, I Didn't have lots of time before my flight and was server fast."}
{"text":"Omg that slider was disgusting. I still ate it but it was nasty. I also noticed another person leaving the 'cheese steak' after taking one bite. If I wasn't so lazy I would have left it and gone to the magazine store to buy some 'nuts'."}
{"text":"Worst coffee ever, wasn't drinkable at all. Food wasn't good either. I asked for Nutella banana crepes, as I went there early morning before catching my plane, they didn't have it so they brought me pancakes with beacon...  Keep walking and stop at Starbucks instead!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and got the yuppi wrap.  Took forever to take my order, the place wasn't that busy but all staff are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  It was seat yourself but only a few tables were actually clean.  The wrap is basically a larger version of a McDonald's breakfast wrap.  No slices of avocado and thick slice bacon is just regular bacon slices."}
{"text":"The service is pretty mediocre. But not all servers are. I just got really unlucky. Tables next to me came after me and ordered after me. Yet all three of them got the meals before and when I asked my server about it, she had an attitude. I fly LA - Toronto once a month and always at this terminal. Will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Fries were good - really crunchy. Grilled cheese and tomato soup was surprisingly good.  Really basic but hit the spot and after a night out."}
{"text":"K, I was hungry and had read the other reviews. I ordered the fried chicken salad and a bottle water takeout. The bartender was very helpful and friendly and food took about 20 minutes to arrive.  I have had a number of takeout salads and this is not a repeater. It was dry and the ranch dressing was flavorless. The best part of the meal was the cold bottled water. Having eaten at all the food options in terminal 3 a terminal, this is a good time to prefer a protein bar and wait to go to your destination for good or even buy food on a plane."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, if I had even gotten service.  The server did not even acknowledge us as we sat and waited to place our order.  She was too busy chatting with the young men sitting at the bar.  She served all of the patrons at the bar but unenthusiastically dropped off orders to the table beside us.  Not once did she stop at our table.  If I could give this restaurant less than one star I would.  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant unless you're just looking to rest your feet.  We left after waiting 20 minutes.  Best to avoid this place."}
{"text":"Waitress was abrupt and when I asked a question about subbing an item and didn't immediately respond to her answer she left us to clear another table. When she got back to us, I asked to sub the bacon for tomato. There was no tomato when I got my food. Pretty busy place, lousy service.  The coffee was decent, hash browns were nice and hot but a small portion- they served them in this little metal pail that wasn't even full. Maybe only 2/3. My eggs were cold too.  When we were finished, she did not ask how the bill was to be divided(separate because my husband is expensing his) or if we were ready for it. She just brought us the bill on one. When we told her they had to be separate, it took her quite a bit more work to do it and she complained we should have told her! Rude. My overall impression was I wouldn't go back here."}
{"text":"Kinda shitty but essential coffee and pre made sandwich place just before gates a6-a8.  Starbucks drip coffee and other assorted food items."}
{"text":"This time I tried the Canadian \"Street Food\" Restaurant called Urban Crave!    My Order-  I ordered the Montreal style Hot Dog which was fun-it had mustard, coleslaw, and onions topped on a steamed beef frank with a soft, yet sturdy bun!    I also ordered Labatts Blue-Canadian Beer.  The Bloody Caesar-  Many people at the bar were ordering Bloody Mary Caesar's which are a Canadian Signature Adult Beverage.  They were nicely garnished with lemons, limes and several thick stalks of celery.  The Staff-  The staff was exceptionally friendly, fast, and professional.  The waitress even offered to mail my postcards as there was not a post office box within the airport security area where the gates were located.  FYI-they have GOOSE ISLAND ON TAP!!  FOR FUN-ORDER THE POUTINE DOG!"}
{"text":"While at the Pierre Elliot Trudeau airport flying to Las Vegas, the Urban crave caught my attention as they advertised serving \"authentic Montreal street cuisine\". Curious I was drawn to the large amount of people dining here at 6:00 am. What I soon discovered this place is anything but street food .  I ordered the \"voted customer's choice\" Montreal Eggs Benedict priced at 15$ . This meal includes 2 poached eggs on an English muffin with a Hollandaise sauce and a side of potatoes. I ordered a fruit salad instead of the potatoes for a healthier option. Service was fast- food on the other hand was very disappointing- both presentation wise and to the palate. Firstly the Hollandaise sauce was way too runny and I could also taste the vinegar from the poached eggs which curded the Hollandaise sauce !!! And to make matters worse the fruits were marinated in a weird herbal sugared syrup. I was so turned off by my meal - I couldn't finish my meal before my flight.   However, I would like to commend my waitress. When I brought this matter to her attention, she volunteered to give me a 10 % discount (her employee discount) which was very sweet.  When she approached the chef, he didn't seem to care.. and said that's usually how eggs Benedict are made. I have brunch all over the city- this place wins the award for vinegared eggs!  Skip this place if your on the go for a flight to the US and stop by at the Tim Hortons instead."}
{"text":"For an airport bar this place is by far not the worst it could be. They have all the basics for a decent airport bar: booze, beer, bar food. Don't expect michelin star quality in an airport and you will be OK here. And considering its one of the few places to get a drink (and the only place to see sports live) in terminal 3 at YYZ, you can't be too picky.   So to the important parts:  1. Booze selection is pretty good. They have a mix of well and brand name booze; grey goose, black label, glenfiddich, jameson, makers, and bacardi make are found here.  2. Draft beer is limited to Keith's IPA (which is not very hoppy) and Bud Light.  3. Bottled beer is a bit better with Corona, Guinness, Heineken, Stella, Canadian, Labatt and a couple others.  4. Wine selection is limited to a select 4-5 reds and whites.  The food is fine for airport food and not as marked-up as other airports considering it is a sitdown place. Try the poutine if you must but do not think this is as good as it gets. Their poutine gets the job done with fries, gravy, and braised beef. But its far from the best Canada can offer as the fries a not as crisp as they can be (not double fried) and toppings are just OK.  This is one of the few places you can sit a group at terminal 3. That is if you can get a seat. By 4pm you are lucky to get a table for 2. This place does fill up quick and you might be better off in other parts of the terminal if you have a group larger than 2."}
{"text":"Shocked by the other mediocre reviews!  Food was great.  Best airport food I have had in a while.  Had the cheesesteak and also the pimento cheese starter.  Both were great! Had to subtract 1 star because they only have sweet iced tea and no unsweetened.  I asked and a woman who sat at the next table asked.  I bet they get the question all the time.  Instead people order tap water so they are losing $."}
{"text":"Generally I don't expect too much from airport food but I was pleasantly surprised with this place.   The space is small so the seating is a bit tight. Add in your luggage and you really don't have that much elbow room.   I got the poutine as my meal and I enjoyed it. It came with some braised beef, cheese curds, and other things I don't quite remember (sauteed onions maybe??). Either way I finished my whole plate because it was that good. The cheesecurds were all at the bottom and that was okay with me because they were my least favorite part of the whole thing (though still enjoyable.  The service wasn't the friendliest but it was prompt.  Given the other options around this terminal, this was definitely the best one."}
{"text":"If you ended up here then be prepared to undergo an unforgettable experience of the worst meal of all time. If youre willing to risk it sincs youre  desperate for any sort of food then do yourself a favour and do NOT get the soba noodle \"salad\". They sprinkle slivers of red and yellow peppers in a vat of pasty noodles like it's the most precious truffle on earth. Bloody hell, im sure they serve better food in prison"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here with the family en route to California.  Maybe I was just cranky from the 4:30 am wake up time, but this place was disappointing.  We had 40 minutes before boarding which I thought would be ample time for a proper sit down breakfast.  The place was very under serviced, we sat down at a table that had not been cleared (there were no clean tables) then waited 10 minutes and then ended up chasing down our service to take our order.  It wasn't her fault, she was obviously very busy and was polite and friendly despite being in a rush.  My coffee cup was not clean and had brown chunks floating in it, probably residue from a dirty cup.  Once we'd ordered our food did come fairly promptly, but was mediocre at best.  I had an egg white scramble, which was greasy, and accompanied by ok home fries, tasteless toast, and shrivelled grapes.  We then had to chase the server down again to pay our bill in order to make it to our gate for boarding.  I think we would have spent less and had a better breakfast at the Starbucks next door..."}
{"text":"Was pretty disappointed that they were out of poutine (I'm traveling at an airport in CANADA). I really wanted to try another helping so I could compare.... I had a snack of bacon, homemade peanut butter and a banana. It was a bit much for one person and I left feeling a little sick and disappointed in myself for eating it all. I would recommended it to a group of two or more people. It was good, just too much for me. Service was a little lacking, but the place was slammed, so completely understandable.   3 stars because it was not good, but not bad. Decently efficient for being at the airport and slammed. It was also very hard to get my carry on luggage in..."}
{"text":"Their IPA tasted like Bud Light - zero hop taste.  I questioned the bartender; he told me it was from Nova Scotia and it's very light, so that  means Nova Scotia has no idea how to make IPA, or these guys were serving Bud Light which was only other beer on tap which I think is the case."}
{"text":"Really great fries! I was honestly surprised because airports aren't exactly known for their food options. The chicken fingers are obviously from a box so avoid those. They serve them with fries and a mustard sauce."}
{"text":"I definitely like the concept much more than the final execution, but all in all, it ain't bad. I mean, I'll take this over airport fast food any day of the week, and you can eat a lot of worse things while you're trekking across the country.  Airport dining is a unique beast. You have all kinds of timing issues that usually don't apply. Either you have a really pressed schedule, or the opposite -- you've been delayed and have all kinds of time to kill. I think the previous is more apt to happen, so you've got to cater to the now now now crowed. Mission accomplished, at least in my case. There was a line when I rolled up, but I was seated quite quickly at the bar. It was alarmingly fast, the amount of time that passed between me submitting an order and the time it came out.   I had chicken sliders, which I'll discuss in a second. But they were lightning fast. The dude behind the bar where I sat was super cool and very on top of taking care of everyone. He was pouring drinks and delivering food and checks and had it really dialed in. YMMV.  It's a small space, open to the rest of the airport, so there's not much escape from the bustle of travelers. I sat at the bar which is the buffer zone, so I had to keep a close eye on my carry one and things were a bit cramped.  And those sliders? Well, they're more like two chicken fingers masquerading as sliders. They came on a bun with slaw and that was fine. Just.. fine. The fries weren't super fresh out of the fryer, and it was plated competently. These are the tradeoffs you make--extra speed means simple, pre-prepared food that comes out quick.   Again, the concept of some kind of urban street eats served up for hungry travelers is nice, but in execution you just sorta order some bar food. But if you need a drink (a beer, perhaps?) this will do the trick. Beer and bar food in an airport."}
{"text":"Ridiculous establishment. We grabbed something from the to go cooler and then waited in line over 20 minutes to pay for it. One staff member working the entire bar and the people trying to grab and go. This is an airport, people aren't out for luxurious time, there trying to grab a bite to eat between flights. More staff desperately needed."}
{"text":"Urban Crave is pretty standard for airport food. If you have a time to kill during a layover, you definitely have worse options than this.  Our food came pretty quickly and it was exactly as I'd expect. I was craving salt and cheese so I'd opted for a grilled cheese with tomato soup and it didn't disappoint. They don't use any fancy breads or cheese but it was cooked well and served warm. It really hit the spot.  The server was very quick to get us our bills which was unnecessary as we weren't in a hurry but I can see how this is definitely an asset at an airport restaurant."}
{"text":"It seems strange to write a review about an airport restaurant but... oh boy. Sat at the one free spot in the bar.  It was a mess which I hate doing but you've gotta take the spot you can at small airport bars. My chair was covered in maple syrup but I was able to trade it out.  Took about 10 minutes to get acknowledged or the area of the bar to be cleared out after I gathered the mess together myself to make it easier for the bartender.  That I can all handle.  It seemed like they may have been a bit overwhelmed.  But the entire half hour or so I was there, the kitchen and one server had an ongoing screaming match in clear view of the entire dining area.  Even when the waitress would walk away, the kitchen would still be shouting and screaming her side of the argument and the waitress would come back and defend herself. My entire, very basic meal (which came out fast after I finally ordered) was shrouded in awkward silence from bar patrons and constant screaming between a waitress and the kitchen, and another front of house employee they kept trying to pull into the argument who tried her best not to get involved."}
{"text":"Really loved the Korean BBQ chicken sliders. The chicken was crispy and the sauce was exactly the BBQ deliciousness I was craving. Only thing I don't get is why my beer costs almost as much as my meal. ?"}
{"text":"Blah blah blah airport food sucks.  That seems to be the consensus.  Of course airport food sucks.  Who comes to an airport and expects a fine dining experience?  One eats at an airport simply for fuel.  Flights are long - airlines have few to no options - you eat so you don't die mid-route.  That said.... Urban Crave is good airport food  - better than most in my travels anyway.  Decent food options aside from the ubiquitous cheeseburger and chicken breast that appear on every other menu at every other airport eatery around the world.  Some local Canadian flair with Poutine on the menu.  Some fun local staff that keep saying \"aboot\" and \"zed\"  - charming in my view.   So while I don't plan to spend my next anniversary dinner at the Urban Crave @ Pearson's Terminal 3, I will stop by and refuel on my next pass through Toronto.  BTW, if you think this is bad, try out FLL, LGA, LAX, TPA, SJC, PHX - you might be singing a different tune when next through YYZ."}
{"text":"The two stars are for the manager. He left this poor girl to run the bar herself, along with the togo food and she was very obviously out of her league. I have been a bartender for years and I would have had trouble running everything they had her doing. The manager hauled his fat ass to the front of house at one point, then went right back into the back. Dishes are stacked up on the counter, people are waiting to get a seat and make orders, and you were shooting the breeze with an employee.   Your bartender did the best she could, and I appreciate that. The failings here are managment not giving the staff the support they need. I have been sitting here for 45 minutes and the plates from the last customer are still in front of me. I've seen a lot of your staff come out front to watch the olympic games, have them take dishes while they are there. It's disgusting."}
{"text":"This was the worst burger I ever had.  The fries were soggy and dripping with oil. The \"homemade\" chips were oil sponges  The beef was tasteless. We returned the fries since they were so bad, they refused to credit them. All in all, we forked $38 for two burgers, fries and chips, no salad.  AVOID IF You CAN"}
{"text":"the dining area is nice (which is refreshing for an airport location), but the food is nothing special - my service was really slow"}
{"text":"My first time with a long layover in Montreal. They are out of a lot of menu items, but the staff is really nice. Families with little babies everywhere, and they navigate it all really well. The stars are for nice service, who were able to calm tired babies after a long flight. The available food was very ordinary."}
{"text":"Their breakfast is just ok! They are located in Terminal 3 by gates A17-20.  Just keep walking and go to the Burger place. I will say it's nice to sit down and have a cup of coffee with beloved cream.  The menu has a nice selection and I ordered the bacon pancakes with maple syrup expecting these delightful light pancakes with crispi bacon but what thy served were these oily yummy pancakes with undercooked bacon.   I rolled one up and covered it with maple syrup and thought this might work...but I spit it out. I never do this but the texture was so bad I couldn't make it go down.  My server was polite and said \"oh you didn't like it\" and I told her the chef needed to cook the bacon and pancakes longer. She smiled and said ok. But she offered to have them remade or she asked if I would like a piece of coffee cake. I opted for the poppy seed coffee cake. It was delicious.  The service was great so I would give my server 5 stars but the chef 1 star."}
{"text":"Waitress was friendly. Food , cuban sandwich was ok. Food production from the kitchen is not slow...IT IS GLACIAL.. almost 40 mins from order to reception!! The second issue is pricing. I ordered wine , carnivor cab, which would typically be $6 us a glass. This place charges $14 canadian  a glass ...total rip off!!"}
{"text":"The food was sorta bland. It was late and we had just gotten into town looking for a quick bite and it honestly was a disappointment. I tried the Yuppie Wrap and I was underwhelmed very little bacon. I would recommend trying some place else."}
{"text":"Making the Best of a Bad Situation  ~C$20 + tip for two Accepts all major credit cards Hasty breakfast while waiting for flight Minimal wait Reviewed as local  I've eaten here more times than I'd like to admit. Food is passable and let's be honest, you're here because there isn't a better option in Terminal 3. It is the least worst option. While it's headline boasts \"authentic street cuisine\", I'm not sure where in Canada I've ever gotten a breakfast poutine. I feel like this is a caricature of a restaurant designed for American businessmen who hold a stereotype of Canadians as they make their way in and out of TO.  I'm not going to bother with too much of a review here, but while the wait staff puts in a decently valiant effort, the service is usually not great which is hard because 100% of the clientele is in-transit and time sensitive.   Airport food quality at airport food prices. Not a great combo, but I was hungry. Don't judge me too poorly for eating here."}
{"text":"This was a regrettable decision. Had I walked to my actual gate, I would have had the choice of a salad from freshii or something from nobel burger.  I ordered the sliders, thinking I was actually getting striploin, instead, out came a sad brisket impostor. Serves me right for not reading completely the menu description. I really need to book that eye appointment sooner rather than later.  The place is packed but it is not indicative of the quality of the meals served."}
{"text":"I would give it a Zero star if I could! Do not waste your money here. Expensive for the quality of food. Paid $30 for a SOGGY corned beef sandwich and a flavorless and cold hotdog. Even my dog would refuse to eat it."}
{"text":"Looked great from the outside, but service was so-so. I had a sore throat and wanted a hot water with lemon to drink and they charged me 0.80 cents. I agreed to pay but I found it rather petty that they charged me for water. I also felt very rushed the whole time I was there. I wanted to see what this street food thing was all about and was not impressed. I got the braised sliders with fries and the burgers were terrible. They seriously need to rethink their menu and get a better chef. However, the fries were actually really good. I'm giving this 2 stars only for the exterior appearance and the fries. They failed in every other way. I wish I read the reveiws on here before I went there, don't make the same mistake."}
{"text":"Never Again!  I ordered chicken strips, waited 35 minutes to find out they were never coming. THEY ARE SOLD OUT!  Best part; the time it took to communicate that to me took up all the time I had to get food. God help the person sitting next to me. When I'm hangry, I'm Hangry."}
{"text":"As far as airport food goes, this is good. We arrived at breakfast and had a yuppie wrap, which was eggs, meat, and veggies in a wrap. A good portion for a reasonable price. Service was quick and friendly. Seating is tight. This was in US departures after customs & immigration."}
{"text":"There is no way this place should be 2 stars.  I have eaten here twice while flying American out of Toronto and enjoyed it each time.  The American part of Terminal 3 is under construction and solid meal options are limited.  This spot has ample seating, multiple charging places and an efficient wait staff.   Both meals I have had at Urban Crave have been very good.  I had a poutine with smoked meat on the 1st trip.  It was rich, smoky and delicious.   This appetizer definitely satisfied my craving for French fries and gravy!  Yesterday I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup.  The sandwich was cheesy, crispy and awesome dipped in the flavorful soup.  The waiters keep drinks refilled and food comes out about 10 min after ordering. I highly recommend trying Urban Crave out if you are in Terminal 3 of Toronto Pearson Airport"}
{"text":"This restaurant in the airport is compact and shoulder to shoulder for seating. The food is 2 stars at most due to quality and presentation. The pricing is high as expected for the airport but food could be much better and standards should be set higher. The food choices are simple but yet they are sub par compared to cheaper fast food options."}
{"text":"Ok. Part of me wants to jump on the bandwagon of hating on this place because the sliders are simply a salty mound of mush served on a bun. I was very excited to order them, but they were just a big ol' disappointment.  However, I must also acknowledge that the fries served with said sliders were crispy and hot. The burger ordered at my table was said to be pretty good. The food came out fairly quickly too.  The best thing here was the service from Caesar. He did not try to up sell us and refilled our drinks without being asked. Unlike a nearby burger restaurant option, you will not be guided to leave an 18% tip on a screen when you order. Service actually comes before the bill!  While options in terminal 3 are really limited, this is an airport food option that is decent, so long as you avoid the sliders."}
{"text":"They advertise this place as to provide \"Authentic Street Food\", whatever that may mean, but that's not they impression I got when my food came out. I ordered the peanut butter & bacon appetizer which comes out with bananas as well and I really liked it! I also got the chicken tenders meal with \"homemade sauces\", didn't taste like it. The space in the restaurant is also EXTREMELY LIMITED, so it's a bit of a squeeze in there. When people think of \"airport food\" this is what they think of. This place is okay, decent if you're starving and have time to get a bite to eat. I'd come back here and try something different on the menu."}
{"text":"Poor service, waited over 40 minutes for my order that never came. When the nice lady next to me, who had been there for only ten minutes got her order ( the same as mine), I got up, paid for my drinks and left hungry to caught my plane."}
{"text":"Reasonable food option in the Montreal airport. It's not fancy, it's not particularly authentic, but I would sit down there again if I find myself traveling through and needing a meal. I enjoyed their poutine."}
{"text":"Got the Yuppie wrap: Thick-cut bacon definitely not thick-cut and barely any bacon. Hand-cut fries in the wrap definitely not hand cut. Sliced avocados in the wrap, none to be seen. Just a tiny smear of avocado \"dressing.\" I pointed that out to the server. \"Oh we never put sliced avocados, always only avocado dressing.\" Right, okay. Just blame the menu then. Oh well, airport food."}
{"text":"Like some of the other reviews below, I'm not sure why the rating for this place is so low. Terminal 3 doesn't have a ton of options and for a sit down establishment this is the best option.  I opted to sit at the bar which is equipped with outlets for you to charge your devices. The service was pretty quick as the food took about 10 minutes to get to me tops which good for rushed travellers at the airport.  I ordered the beef sliders as it was one of their Canada Day menu items. It came with 2 sliders and a side of fries. The slider meat was seasoned reasonably well and the aioli was good. The bites where I also had the cheddar and the avocado were especially nice. To top it off the bun edges were toasty while the rest of the bun was soft. Taste was decent, nothing mind blowing. The fries were nice and crispy and came out hot.  As for size, this seemed more like an appetizer to me but was listed as an entree. Disclaimer that this probably would not fill up someone who was looking for a complete dinner.  Overall pretty decent. I would rate it a little higher but the price was about $17 after tax and tip for the sliders which at a normal restaurant you could probably get a normal sized burger."}
{"text":"Food is actually Good for an airport. I was pleasantly surprised.  Servers are awesome. But it's still an airport so what can you say? Crowded."}
{"text":"I think it's common knowledge that airport food is most likely not any good. This place pretty much lives to that expectation with a twist, it's horrible. The Cold Noodles taste like paste and their salad is essentially shredded lettuce. It's like they open a bag of shredded lettuce and said,  \"we have salad AND coleslaw.\"   Even though the food was horrible, the waitress was willing to switch out a meal that I did not like, free of charge in an attempt to keep me satisfied. It's because of that action that Urbancrave will get 2 instead of a 1 star review.   Besides that interaction, the food really is horrible."}
{"text":"Price is good, but you get what you pay for. Ordered the burger which was bland and looks like it came from a frozen patty pack. I should have gone to Noble Burger a few steps down to get one there for the same price. Perhaps next time I have to try the other items and hopefully this boring burger is just an anomaly."}
{"text":"It was a decent place to relax before heading on my flight. The food and service was alright."}
{"text":"I love this place when I need a quick last minute meal before hopping on a plane. Last time I was here we got chicken sliders for my kids and I got the maple pork belly salad. I know what's the point of a salad when you're gonna pile pork belly on it?  But so so good and generous portions!!!  We loved our food and other passengers were actually surprised to see how good the food looked.  We feasted on the plane while our neighbors had their cheese and crackers. Ha!  Luckily, they were such sweet and funny neighbors. So get to the airport early and save yourself the eye rolls.  The staff on both occasions were really nice and helpful as I was very weary of ordering airport food.  They are mindful that people are in a rush.  Today my waitress let me know that judging by how full the dining area was it would be about 10 minutes. She was about right, too, so bravo to her!  My only complaint this time was that they dressed the salad. My bad for not requesting dressing on the side but I feel like that should be a given when it's take-out."}
{"text":"Not bad for a small airport restaurant in Toronto's infamous Terminal 3. I walked in and seated myself after receiving a blank stare from the young lady who was supposed to greet patrons (sista, would it kill you to greet someone with a smile? Sorry for troubling you for a table in a half-empty restaurant. Good times, girl).   As I seated myself a very friendly server came over and presented me with a menu. I settled in and ordered the \"Poutine, Eh?\" About ten minutes later my order arrived (I'm not sure what others are going on about re: slow service).   As for the poutine - nothing special but it hit the spot. Smoked bacon, cheese curds, crispy fries. The gravy was a buttery, smoky combo. It was quite nice. For $9 bucks - not too bad.   My server was very friendly and sweet. Wish I got her name. She was so helpful and had a wonderful smile. We need more servers like her in Toronto restaurants."}
{"text":"I had my doubts, but surprisingly after eating, I have no complaints. It's lunch time but not too busy we sat ourselves and the server was very polite and took our order quickly. 12 minutes to deliver a burger, fries and a house salad for my girlfriend and I to share was perfect timing. I had my eye on the time since after all, we're at the airport. The burger was a bit dry, but had a good flavor. The fries were hot and crisp and the salad  did its job with nice lettuces and carrots with a balsamic vinaigrette. Overall 3.5 stars but I'll round up to 4."}
{"text":"The staff are friendly and the ambiance is nice, but I found the food here highly disappointing.  I stopped for lunch before my flight and ordered the Pimento + Pickles appetizer and the Urban Burger. The burger was overdone and flavorless, and the iceberg lettuce and beefsteak tomatoes were watery and bland. The fried had very little seasoning, too. At least the sweet pickles were tasty. I also got a chocolate chip banana cake for dessert, which wasn't anything special (it was just a banana bread loaf wrapped in plastic wrap), but it was sweet and satisfying, and it helped to partially redeem the meal.  Some of the breakfast items looked ok, so perhaps they'd be better for that. But regardless which meal of the day, if you end up eating here, I hope your experience is better than mine."}
{"text":"I generally avoid airport restaurants, unless it's a Chili's that serves cheesy nachos and/or it offers free wi-fi so I don't have to pay Boingo a dollar for every byte of data transmission in an act of desperation.  Speaking of desperation, a delayed departure prompted my colleague and I to try Urban Crave.  \"Authentic street cuisine\" did sound inviting.  And the restaurant has a welcoming open layout.  My colleague chose the buckwheat (soba) noodle salad and fries (no, they are not ribbon chips as advertised).  I was in the mood for a grilled cheese sandwich complemented by tomato soup, and was conjuring up memories of always enjoying the combo at Bouchon Bakery as we waited for just a short while for the food to arrive.  The fries and sandwich barely passed muster, but the noodles and soup were inedible--certainly not something you would list as your last meal on your star-studded Yelp profile (no, that is not a reference to mine).  What followed was hilarious.  Seeing that we barely ate, our server came by and said she would take care of us, and after minutes of deliberation with her manager, she said they would take 25% off but, with a wink of the eye, she went on to add, \"I took care of you, hope you take care of me\"--a clear reference to getting a big tip.  As we were leaving, we suggested to the manager that he look into the quality of the food, to which he nonchalantly replied \"You are the ones who picked those items from the menu\".  Certainly not a shining example of owning up to what was being doled out on his watch.  I will never be going back here, for reasons that are both obvious and upsetting.  On a side note, this is on the US side of the terminal, past Immigration.  Not a good first taste of your destination."}
{"text":"This place is TERRIBLE. Very slow. My wife got her breakfast, which was not as described in the menu. It was cold. Took about 20 min to make eggs. Mine came 5 minutes later. Guess pancakes are more difficult to make. Avoid this place if you can"}
{"text":"Montreal Beef sandwich was good, but very small.  My colleague has burger which he said was only marginal.  Service was excellent and food was served promptly."}
{"text":"As others have suggested, if you can wait for a meal at your destination or a stop over, do that.   I give two stars for the service, really as the food portion is small for the money.  But what do you expect with overpriced airport food?!"}
{"text":"First of all, my server was terrific. She was friendly and accommodating.   The food arrived quickly....but it was only a $10 hot dog and $5 side poutine. Never order the hotdog! It was boiled, tasted generic, and lukewarm. I couldn't take more than one bite.  The poutine was great. It wasn't hot enough to melt the cheese curds, but still good. The burgers were not presentable and looked subpar. They need to improve everything. Where is Chef Ramsey??"}
{"text":"Considering it is Terminal 3, the food and service here are quite acceptable. And the staff were able to speak and understand English."}
{"text":"This is not the worst airport food. The burgers are okay. The fries are pretty good. The poutine was better than the poutine you can get delivered to you in the main waiting area. The  service was reasonably fast, although this still isnt a good spot unless you're killing time. Beers are cheaper over in Meteor Diner."}
{"text":"So before I get to the review let me say Yelp Elite or Yelp Corp are Hype beast, I have traveled everywhere domestically minus 4 states, just this week California to Georgia to New York now to Atlanta and then Houston and yet still no elite status What gives btw Yelp I check in everywhere so I'm no faking the funk now for the review on Urban crave in Toronto Airport food was ok didn't see much street food but was good when in a pinch and can't find a place to eat."}
{"text":"Its ok. Nothing urban or street about it. Kind of tired of people using the excuse its airport food. There can be good airport food with airport prices."}
{"text":"If you're looking for The worst service available, be sure to eat here. It'll only take 25 minutes to bring a cold soup and grilled cheese. Then the waiter will gladly make fun of you for sending it back. I'd rather have eaten airplane food."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly bad. The place looks really nice. From the outside you expect this place to have good food. The menu should have been the first hint. Not a lot of options, and even still, not a lot of good options.   I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato bisque. It took 20 minutes to make. Plane white bread with little cheese in the center. The bisque tasted watered down. Overall it was very bland. Trust me, you will get better food from the place further down the terminal."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why such low reviews as our experience was great!  My family and I enjoyed quick service from a very friendly young lady, some frosty cold beverages and a quick snack.  The hubs and I shared a bowl of Cold Soba Noodle Salad- light and fresh with just the right amount of ingredients.  I also shared (or stole) some of my kids plate of bacon, peanut butter and bananas  (see photo) all that was missing was chocolate.... cuz it wasn't decadent enough (I kid) it was dang delicious and I wasn't about to miss the chance of eating bacon right before they stuck me in a metal tube and hurled me through the the sky.  All and all pretty good stuff!  The menu was a little pricey but totally expected in an airport so no surprise for me there.   I'd eat here again if I had time before a flight."}
{"text":"Yes, a run of the mill food joint, in a sad little terminal for people headed to America. There's nothing spectacular about this place. Overpriced. Squirrely service. Basic menu. But I appreciated the hour I sat and waited for time to pass, having made a poor choice in airlines and the pathetic terminal its housed in. It could have been worse -- several $13/sandwich places gouging for PB&Js."}
{"text":"Almost zero customer service. It took 10 minutes at least to be acknowledged by the bar. The short bartender muttered under her breath about her co workers and only paid attention to the male bar patrons. I come to airports a lot and the bar service is always so terrible. It's like we are a nuisance to them. Unfortunately as a 20% tipper usually , I cannot do that anymore in airports. Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"One of my best airport dining experiences. The service was friendly and the pork belly salad was excellent. Prices were very reasonable. Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a quick bite to eat. It's next to Gate 74 at the YUL  airport."}
