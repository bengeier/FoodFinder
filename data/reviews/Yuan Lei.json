{"text":"Bon restaurant. Le seul gros bémol, c'est l'éclairage HORRIBLE au néon.  Ce restaurant sert de la bonne nourriture, mais pour le soir 0000000 pas d'ambiance ni décoration.  Bref une simple cafétéria insipide!"}
{"text":"Terrible service! Received dishes in ten minute intervals. Shrimp dish was very small and very salty. Chicken was awful- we couldn't even eat it. Beef dishes were ok but salty and saucy. They also tried to charge for dishes never received after we had asked twice. Will never return."}
{"text":"If I could give this less than a 1 star I would!  Terrible salt and pepper shrimp! Just a ton of finely ground pepper thrown on the shrimp that were excessively fried in a thick batter! Plain boxed noodles with lettuce and cabbage disgusting and a crispy duck that could rival Kentucky friend chicken as the worst piece of fried meat ever! And all the food comes out staggered so that it is all nice and cold by the time you eat it! Ridiculous! Avoid at all costs!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was opened last year. We ordered two dishes. One is deep fried eggplant and the Other is stir fried kidneys. The eggplant is average. Kidneys are very tasty. The price and service are good."}
{"text":"Such an authentic Chinese restaurant! I moved from Toronto to Montreal, surprised me I can have the opportunity to have such a spread!!  Also, their combo meals are perfect for a quick bite!  Bravo!"}
{"text":"I like it a lot, pretty good chinese resto in westisland. I had potato salade, salt & peper shrimp, and cumin beef"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a nice little clean restaurant. Super simple, clean and has hints of Chinese decor pieces.  FOOD: I really liked the food here. They offer authentic Chinese food. Their garlic green beans are delicious. The flavor is great and the portions are decent. Also I did find the meals a little bit too greasy but hey, you're eating at a Chinese restaurant so I'm not too taken aback.  PRICE: The menu items were a bit on the pricier side. But considering the fact that this is one of the few authentic Chinese restaurants in the West Island, I can't say that I'm too surprised at the slight spike in prices.  SERVICE: Staff here is quite friendly. They do their jobs and they are quick and efficient."}
{"text":"Not bad. Taste was there and i would give 3.5 stars. The taste was there for the authentic chinese food. But it still lacked something. The chicken was just not the real deal and I asked them up front if its the real thing. To much batter for me. Although the portion was huge. Dumplings were OK. Loved the filing but hated the skin. Beans were acceptable. My wife order some other chinese dishes and from my experience taste was there...."}
{"text":"Worst food. Meats look and taste like plastic... chow mein in a sloppy liquid... not recommended"}
