{"text":"TWaited over half an hour for ziti. The table next to us knew one of the employees. Ordered 10 minutes after us and got there food before us. Never again. Thanks Mike."}
{"text":"I visited Lilly's on Forbes Avenue in Squirrel Hill last week.  I decided to give it a try because several people were eating at the sidewalk tables and the pasta and meatballs looked good with generous portions.  There are pictures on the wall and you order from the wall menu by building your pasta dish in three steps.  It was dinner time so I ordered ziti (step 1) with pink tomato vodka sauce at a hefty price of $9.99 (step 2) and added meatballs (step 3) from the fresh toppings at 2 for $1.49.  I also ordered a large piece of Tiramisu for $4.99.  This was a take out order that cost me 30 minutes of my time.  The wait seemed a bit long but I was hungry and looking forward to enjoying my meal when I got home 15 minutes later.  It was around 7 pm when I ordered this meal on a Wednesday night and they must have been running low on vodka sauce and pasta because both were scarce and what there was of the sauce was bland tasting.  Also, they must have run out of the meatballs I paid for as they were not included in the bag so I can't comment on the taste.  I will say that the young employees they have working there are more concerned with socializing than paying attention to the orders they are filling.  When I got to the dessert, it was half the size of the palm of my hand maybe 4\" long and 2\" wide and looked smashed up.  I paid $5.00 for a large size so how small must their small size be for $3.00?  The Tiramisu did not taste fresh made.  More like it came out of a generic frozen box.  Don't waste your hard earned money here.  Rose Tea Cafe just up the street has better noodles than this place!!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to order online and pick it up at 6:15 p.m. on our way to a 7:00 outdoor concert.  Since it was 5:20, the site limited my choices to 6:30 or ASAP (15-20 minutes).  Since I didn't want the order sitting there for 30-40 minutes waiting for me, I called and asked what to do.  Mike was very helpful and said to send it through and he would see that it was ready at 6:15.  When I got there at 6:10 and asked the counter person, it was not ready yet (expected).  My people waited in the car for me.  At 6:25 when I asked her again, she asked Mike, who apparently put it aside and never started it!  I finally got it at 6:35 and we hurried to our concert.  Upon arrival and opening the food, I found that the salads had no dressing and the \"special salad\" had no apples, cranberries or dressing.  The chicken marsala was tasy, but dry.  The three \"free\" cannoli Mike included were okay, but certainly didn't overcome the \"bad taste.\"  I filled out an online feedback form which they've either not looked at or chosen to take in stride.  I would not return."}
{"text":"I thought this was pretty good food.  It's recently been added to Campusfood so I thought I'd give it a try.  I've tried other pasta places but this was definitely better than I expected.  I ordered the Lobster Ravioli as it was featured as a signature dish and Mac & Cheese Wedges as an appetizer.    The Mac & Cheese Wedges were different but a little too oily for me, but quite delightful regardless (at least when hot :D).     The Lobster Ravioli was a surprise.  I was surprised by the number of options that you could put on the pasta.  Although it costs money to add the extra toppings, the meatballs and eggplant that I added to the ravioli was the right choice.  As my choice of sauce, I chose the Pink Sweet Crab Cream Sauce, which had actual crab in it unlike some other restaurants.  Very creamy.  The ravioli itself was stuffed with  cheese and lobster.  Overall I think this was an amazing dish.  When I ordered, the food got delivered right to my door step.  Definitely want to order from here again and try something new."}
{"text":"I have gone to Lilly's in the afternoon for take out on 3 occasions. The young woman,Autumn, who has waited on me each time is exceedingly courteous and professional. The pasta is good albeit I can understand the criticisms about the high prices. I think the afternoon employees are well-trained and seem willing to make your experience a positive one. I will definitely continue going; and, I am sure that they will listen and adjust to the untoward comments. Again, my only issue would address the price points and it would probably temper the critics if Lilly's would lower some of its pricing. My afternoon stops there have yielded positive results both with food and service."}
{"text":"I went into Lilly's with my friend the other day and was very surprised at how pleased we were with the experience.  The location in Squirrel Hill is great, and the music they have playing in the background gives the place a great ambiance.  After waiting a little less than ten minutes for our food, I received my linguini in vodka sauce with chicken and prosciutto.  I ordered my pasta al dente and, sure enough, it did come as such.  The chicken was good and it had great grill marks on it.  I would definitely recommend anyone to order that dish. My friend got linguini with oil and garlic sauce with shrimp on top.  I kept eyeing his plump, vibrant looking shrimp and he finally let me have one from his plate.  The shrimp had good and fresh seafood flavor.  I wouldn't mind ordering it in the future, but I think next I need to try the butternut squash ravioli with a sage butter sauce.  Someone sitting at the table next to us ordered it and it looked really good.  The second person at the other table said he ordered a cold whole wheat pasta with pesto sauce and said it was very tasty.  Lilly's is definitely the kind of restaurant where you have to come back and order other delicious looking dishes. The only thing negative I found with my experience is that our side-order salads didn't have enough dressing.  This was quickly remedied by the man named Mike that was working there, who took our food to the kitchen and had some dressing added.  It wasn't too big of a deal because I'm pretty sure we just like a lot of dressing on our salads.   I will definitely be doing many follow-up visits to Lilly's in the future to try out the different pasta, sandwich, and salad dishes that they have to offer."}
{"text":"I really don't now what to do with this place. They have a great concept and they deliver which is very convenient, but the product is incredibly inconsistent.  Every time we order from here one of us has a great dish and the other has a disgusting one. My husband came home with our food and my angel hair with meat sauce was gummy, dry, and just plain not good. I've had this before and it was great, so I knew it wasn't the way it was supposed to be.   We called about it and the girl had the nerve to say \"It looked fine to me.\" SERIOUSLY?! These kids at this place really need to learn a thing or two about customer service. My husband had to ask for a manager to get the order fixed. To his credit, the manager was quite friendly and delivered us a new order (along with the side salads that were originally missing from our order...come on! And it's not the first time that has happened)   My new pasta still tasted funny...it must have been that day's batch of sauce. But my husband's food was good this time. I just don't get it. They seem to have a quality control issue."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. The prices are too high and the service is bad.   I gave this place 4 chances.  The food was very good all 4 times. Delicious and fresh, but too expensive. The cheapest lunch pasta option is 7.99 pre-tax. without meat.  All four times waiting time  was over 20 minutes even though one of those times I pre-ordered online (40 minutes total wait time) and the other time I only took desert to go. None of those times did they have long lines or anything. Just 2-3 people.   People working there are very unprofessional, unorganized and work too slow. They constantly look worried about messing up people's orders and can't organize the process efficiently.   That said, the owner/GM is very nice and friendly, always finds something to say, apologize for the wait, offer a drink etc. One time he added free cannolis to my order. Those were delicious! Nicely filled with great tasting cream.   So today I was passing by and went in just to buy the cannolis to go. It took them over 20 minutes to make those and when I got home I saw that all three of them had almost no filling at all! Just some filling on each side, but absolutely nothing inside!   I might try other locations of this chain, but will never visit this one again."}
{"text":"This place looks like a chain you would find in any food court mall.  The concept, however, is interesting and the food is surprisingly good.    So you walk in and can either order any of the pasta selection or build your own!  That's right, you get to pick the type of pasta, the sauce, and add on whatever you like.  This is great if you like to think outside of the box or like mixing up your usual order every now and then.  The place is priced really well.  I ordered the four cheese tortellini and caesar salad for $9!  Yes, you read that right.  I said $9!!!    The thing I found most interesting about this place was that I was asked if I wanted my pasta al dente or well done.  I've never been asked this question and why would you ever order your pasta well done?  Needless to say I ordered mine al dente and it came out just so.    I also tried a \"build your own\" pasta which was delightful.  The garlic bread was alright but when dipped in marinara sauce.... wow.  That garlic bread rose to a whole new level.  Also, the caesar salad was MUCH better than I expected.  I suspect it was all the dressing.  I wanted more!  This is an express restaurant so it's not intimate.  It really feels like you could be in a food court mall.  The food comes out fast but it's a great value and the taste is pretty amazing."}
{"text":"DH & I dropped in last night since we were in a pinch and didn't enough time or groceries on hand to make a meal.  We were on our way to Aladdin's when we spotted this place.    It looked like a chain on the outside, and it's more certainly a chain on the inside.  The place has a very nice setup, with colorful pictures of the different type of pasta.  They were playing some lively music, which brought a nice vibe to the place.  The place is setup like a chipotle or a subway where you can customized your pasta.  We noticed the pasta servings were quite large (in our opinion) so we decided to split, and order a salad plus garlic bread.  The food was delicious!  You can taste the freshness in the homemade pasta, the sauce, the grilled bread - with REAL garlic on it, and the salad.  The staff/service was excellent.  They were young kids, but they served the food fast, and with a smile.  I didn't have any issues ordering, or receiving our food.  The drawbacks are price.  I thought the salad was priced high at $7.99.  Although it was a good sized portion.  It's understandable that the pasta is pricey since it's fresh pasta, and fresh sauce, not mass produced food from olive garden.  However I do not like that fact you have to pay extra money for each topping.  It should operate more like subway I think, with unlimited toppings :)."}
