{"text":"My wife and I order take out from Mt Everest once a week - we absolutely love it.  The food is amazing and it is phenomenal value.  Our 3 year old son spencer is also a big fan!!  We recommend Mt Everest to all our friends."}
{"text":"My favourite Nepalese restaurant for sure, and one of my top Indian choices.   Lots of flavour, and great options. Recommend this place to everyone.  My favourite items: Palungo Ko Saag, Bhuteko Cauli, Chicken Makhani, Chicken Shahi Korma, and Hariyali Tikka."}
{"text":"The most expensive Indian food ever for delivery! Two small container box without rice cost $40 already! There are better Indian restaurants out there for better services and quality for this price....maybe dine in but definitely not for delivery."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Authentic Nepali and not your run of the mill Indian mainly fare. Good staff and service. Well worth going!"}
{"text":"I am a self-confessed foodie, and so I'll explain why this much looked-forward-to event turned into the worst nightmare. This restaurant has the most horrible customer service that you can imagine. Me and a friend went over in the early part of the evening and resto was already pretty crowded. One of the servers sat us down at a 'waiting' table in the front and said the table would be ready in about 20 minutes. He put down a couple of poppadums and then vanished. 35 minutes went by, the waiting area was getting pretty crowded. We were getting antsy by now. My friend went and found the guy and asked him for an update 'only 5 minutes sir!' OK..another 15 went by..my friend went again to look for the sever who (guess what) took one look at him and ran inside!! Meanwhile, even those waiting after of us were seated. We managed to find the floor manager who looked surprised that we'd been waiting for 1 hour plus. I had enough and said- look, either we sit asap or we can leave, to which he replied - not possible today...human error... I'd be happy to serve you another day...we waited for him to add the words 'on the house' or at least a measly 'at a discount' but NO! nothing...he just looked at us blankly. We left the resto hungry, tired and with a resolve to tell other foodies like us about how LITTLE THEY CARE FOR THE CUSTOMER!! Oh and btw- you get seated first if you're white! :-( epic, epic fail."}
{"text":"My wife and son and i chose Mt everest based on our location on bloor west and yelp reviews.  The decor is clean and pleasant and we were greeted as soon as we came in.  After our orders were taken, it took quite a while for our food to arrive and we were starting to get jittery.  It was early for dinner, 4 45 , but it was not clear why it took over 35 minutes.  All i can say is that the wait was worthwhile, the food was very good.  Tandoori veggies, lamb tikka, hunters platter, chicken masala, everything was hot and tasty, spiced just right.  The sauce and yoghurt marinade were balanced and just right.  What we appreciated the most was the quality of the lamb and other meats.  They do not cut corners on quality. A satisfying dinner."}
{"text":"I like Indian food, but sometimes find it too oily for me. I had no expectations, so we very impressed by the evening. We dined on the Groupon with friends. Arrived early for a 5pm reservation, naturally, any restaurant would be quiet. We were offered a table near the door and I asked for another table further in. It's cold out, its 5pm, quiet and we are the first guests to arrive.   Service otherwise was excellent and we received unexpected white cloth table service. Staff made suggestions, attentive service throughout the evening and not intrusive.   We ordered: Appetizers: Nepali-Chicken Momo - very similar to Shanghai style steamed dumplings Indian-Chef's special Mt. Everest Assorted Appetizer - we all enjoyed the variety, different flavours, textures and depth of flavours.-favorite  Breads: Garlic Naan - favourite Paneer Kulcha - stuffed with cottage cheese - a little heavier.  Entrees: Nepali-Khasi Ko Maasu-goat meat with bone - good flavor, but meat is still very attached to the bone, a chewier meat. Indian: Chicken Shahi Karma (mild) very tender moist chicken in a rich and cashew sauce-favourite Butter chicken and Shrimp Masala - all good  Desserts: Gulab Jamun - delish served hot. It is sweet if you are not used to sweet desserts Kulfi - On any dessert menu offering kulfi, I am willing to try their version. I enjoyed it, but I have had creamier Kulfi before.   An excellent evening and we will come back!"}
{"text":"delicious well-priced food with an awesome location on bloor street  shared several with five people, had  saag lamb- amazing, very tender and perfectly cooked lamb  chicken jalfrezi- excellent level of spice  vegetable tandoori- great dish for sharing, comes steaming hot with a huge variety of vegetables and paneer, my fav things to order here  shrimp jalfrezi- just as good at the chicken jalfrezi bhuteko cali- traditional vegetable dish from nepal, very well seasoned, reminded me of my travels in the Kathmandu Valley!  yes service is slow but I have been to Nepal and service is WAY slower (they make everything from scratch and multiple orders means long waits) in that country so it's a very traditional laid back dining atmosphere"}
{"text":"The best butter chicken in Toronto for sure!  Besides that, there's an extremely diverse menu; love the tandoori chicken, daal, mango lassi.  Palak paneer is great, and I don't even normally like spinach!  Also really beautifully decorated."}
{"text":"Amazing Indian Food. ordered the vegetarian meal for two and was very impressed with everything-- the vegetables were delicious, the saag paneer is the best I have ever tasted and the Naan is so fresh and tasty. Great service + great food= happy customer."}
{"text":"Been going to this restaurant for years since it was in annex. Fresh food and great taste. Saag paneer is best !!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner after work.   Ambience-Liked the music in the background. It was relaxing and wasn't loud and annoying like some other restaurants I've been to.  Service-The service was attentive and friendly. It does take them some time to bring you the food so it's good to keep that in mind if you're really hungry.  Food. We ordered the following: Naan bread Butter Chicken Chicken Tandoori-nice and hot as it was served on a sizzling hot place. Some parts got charred. Basmatic rice Lamb Gosht recommended by the host-I found a lot of the pieces to be dried. Perhaps the leg of lamb would have been better.  Verdict. I liked the butter chicken and chicken tandoori. I didn't try the naan but my dinner companions raved about it.  I did find it expensive for the three of us as there was nothing to spectacular about this place. I would probably skip this place in the future and go to Little India for lunch buffet instead."}
{"text":"The service was friendly and attentive without being intrusive--an ideal balance. The friend I met for dinner here had been here many times before and usually ordered the meat dinner for two. We decided to try the vegetarian version this time.   Delicious! The dhal was fabulous, as was the saag paneer. Fresh naan and thick, not too sweet lassi. The kheer was similar--rich, but not overly sweet.  In all, a delicious meal! We lucked out in being seated without a reservation, but the waiter seemed a little nonplussed at first, and we had an option of one of two tables, as all of the rest of them were reserved. So--probably best to call ahead if you're planning on coming for dinner.  My one regret is that the dinner special was so enticing--and delicious, and filling--that I never got a chance to try the other tempting options on the menu!"}
{"text":"Good quick service and all of the chicken dishes were fantastic. Highly recommended for anyone in the area. I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Food is bland and portions are really small for the price. They charge way too much for a portion that will not make you full. The butter chicken comes in a small bowl ($14) and it had like 5 pieces of meat. It was so bland. The other dishes we received were just as bland and horrible. All their prices are way overpriced compared to the amount they give you and especially the long wait you have endure to receive your food.   Honestly wouldn't recommend this place, you can get BETTER TASTING food and especially MORE FOOD for a cheaper price. Spent around $35 and it wasn't worth one penny."}
{"text":"I would like to make known that I was actually contacted by the owners because of my experience here. They are extremely professional, and I highly respect the way they choose to conduct their business. In the future, I will definitely choose to dine here again."}
{"text":"Went here with a Nepalese friend of mine. Delicious Naan bread and whatever else we had was good too. My friend ordered in Nepalese so I have no idea what the dishes were, but they were sufficiently spicy and easily mopped up with the bread, which was hot and freshly made.   I think one of the appetizers was called Momo, it reminded me of dim sum but much spicier. Here is a picture from a google search. http://www.travelandtournepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Momo-With-Sauce.jpg  Highly recommend the momo. I would go here again on my next visit to Toronto. Price was reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING.  I frequented the Bloor Street location and miss it dearly, but the food is just as good on Eg.  The vegetarian Nepali dishes are my favourite, I swear, I have dreams about this food - the tarekoo aloo, jhane ko dal...  EVERYTHING.  And the wait staff is wonderful - really good, friendly people who remember you and are always happy to see you."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with some other people since we had a Groupon deal. The regular prices are similar to many other Indian restaurants in Toronto (and perhaps slightly better) so having the groupon was a great deal.  We ordered a variety of dishes such as the chicken tandoori, fish massala, butter chicken, lamb curry and some more. All were well-executed. We did not try any desserts because we were so full from the regular meal.  I thought that the food quality was good as in any other Indian-style restaurants I have been to in Toronto (such as Lahore Tikka House for example). I recommend going here especially if you can get a groupon deal."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Have been getting delivery from them for a while. They accommodate for some non dairy dishes and are generally very helpful getting you what you want. The food is fantastic. Well spiced and very fresh. I have had many Indian meals ( also having lived in the UK), this is my favourite of my Toronto area. Highly recommended ."}
{"text":"Expérience géniale. Le Népalais c'est très bon. On peut choisir son niveau de piment, no / small / medium / hot / very hot. Service amical et attentif. Offre le doggy bag en partant."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian/Nepalese place in Toronto. I love the vegetarian combo, and the Chana Masala, and the Aloo Gobi...and so much more about this place. The servers are all extremely kind and friendly. If you order a complicated dish, it may take more time to come out of the kitchen--but at least you know they are cooking it with care and not throwing it in the microwave."}
{"text":"we have been there 2 days ago, good place for dinning... food was really amazing. service was good. it newly opened in our neighbour hood at eglinton and laird. pleasant place to spend the time with family. we are 5 ppl there, odered lot of food every thing was really very good . Nawabi tikka, garlic naan are amazing... boti kabab masala, palak paneer, butter chicken and nepali dishes like califlower and potato with bamboo shoots are amazing.... perfect place for pleasant and good. yummy.. will be back again soon....!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Even though the place is a bit small, especially when it's busy, the service was courteous and the food was absolutely delicious.  Best butter chicken I've had in a long time.  Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"Service was very good. The butter chicken was the best we'd ever had, so full of flavor. We also had the Kheera Raita and Kukhura Ko Maasu (Chicken with bone), both very good. Presentation was very nice. We enjoyed our meal there."}
{"text":"I had the chicken and nan bread, was delicious. Seems to be a family owned establishment and the owners are very friendly. Would highly recommend and is reasonably priced. Parking is a bit of an issue."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I had a vegetarian homemade cottage cheese + creamy tomato mix.. i forgot the name of the dish, but regardless it was fantastic. My boyfriend ordered some sort of chicken, which was extremely tender and juicy. Overall, one of the best Indian I had in Toronto..   One down side is that in comparison to the ambiance and portions, the price was a bit too expensive. Our dinner was one order of each rice, naan, the chicken, and the tomato... tax + tip was a total of $40. Not cheap at all.  I'd probably go again but I wish it was a bit cheaper. ( The vegetarian dish was $12 before tax ! Which is normally the price of a  chicken someplace else)  Service was good, the food came out pretty quickly.  Good dinner overall!!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Indian joint.  Can't beat the takeout student special - 2 (smaller size) dishes, rice, naan/roti, salad, raita, and a beverage for $10.99 (veg) or $11.99 (non-veg or combo)."}
{"text":"So, this review is based on my experience with the lunch buffet.  On food alone, I would have rated 2 stars because it all seemed a little old at that point (like it had been out for a while), but I came in at the end of lunch.  The rest of the experience was great, though - it was a cheap meal, it was fast (I was alone, eating on my way to a meeting) and the service was unobtrusive but consistent.  My water was always full and I had as much naan as I wanted.  A note: a lady at a nearby table was complaining that the food was all too spicy.  I am pretty spice-averse, and found everything to have heat but didn't mind it.  So, if you're like that lady and have a zero spice tolerance, beware.  Maybe don't eat indian food though, you know?"}
{"text":"I've been to Mt Everest twice and I left quite happy both times. The service is excellent and the flavours memorable. I went with three other people and ordered the typical butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, garlic naan and a vegetarian dish with spinach, i forget the name. Normally, after eating Indian cuisine, I am usually ready for a nap. After eating here, I still felt quite alive...yet satisfied. There didn't appear to be a layer of oil on the top which I find with some other places. This, I know makes some of the flavour but at Mt Everest, it still tasted fantastic. Medium was the right amount of spice...a bit of a kick but not overwhelming.  Also like most Indian places, it is always good to get a few different items and share. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Had a lot expectations about the original Nepali food... but, this place didn`t meet my expectations... other than low, cool and mesmerizing mountain music playing though their speakers..."}
{"text":"I see some comments about it not being authentic Nepalese, it's just Indian.   I don't know either way.  There are a few dishes there I've never had in an Indian restaurant from, but I don't know enough to say where they're from  I will say this.  If it's Indian, it's the best Indian food I've found in Toronto.   It's amazing.  I love their Naan, their butter chicken, basically everything I've tried.   They're food is fantastic.  (I've only done takeout a couple of times so I can't say about in the restaurant)."}
{"text":"I always love the food here.  The lunch buffet is the best, but dinner here is great too, clearly a little pricier though.  Even so, I go back to this place all the time when I am in the neighborhood.  I went again last night with some friends.  Only one friend was disappointed, he ordered the tandoori fish, he said it wasn't very tandoori and the portion was small.  (But it looked the best, arriving on a sizzling plate)  He was lamenting all of this after the meal.  Everyone else was well satisfied though.  One had the lamb and as another friend of mine did years ago, they both loved it.  One tried the first chicken option on the menu and he loved it too.  I had the okra dish, it was so tasty.   The service was fast, polite and efficient."}
{"text":"Since we came across their Groupon, went to this restaurant.  The Non Veg appetizers and garlic naan were good but we were very disappointed by the chicken tikka masala. Paid $15 for it and had to leave it after 1 morsel. It had only raw onions and chicken pieces in it. Felt puking after a bite. We even complained about their food to the waiter but to no avail. He seemed indifferent to our feedback and said that's how it is made in their country(Nepal).   Also we could not order the Nov Veg. Bhojan (For Two) with our Groupon since they said it was already at a discounted price.  Overall, we would not go back to this restaurant ever again. This review is totally based on our own experience and other might have had a better experience."}
{"text":"The best Indian food I have ever tasted! You have to try the butter chicken and garlic naan! I have been to many Indian restaurants and this beats almost all that I have tried!! A+++"}
{"text":"Not authentic Nepalese cuisine at all (born and raised in Nepal). We ordered Newari cuisine which is very specific to Nepal itself and noticed they had more of an \"Indian\" taste in most of the dishes. And even the waiter admitted that the Newari/ Nepalese cuisine was more \"Indian incorporated\" than it was Nepalese. Serivce was good in general."}
{"text":"The food here is very good, and the service is exceptional.  There is a wide variety of foods, from vegetarian to meat dishes and non-spicy to spicy ones.  The Naan, though seemingly pricey, is very good and big.  The food comes relatively quicky, and despite the relatively small portions, they are actually very rich and filling."}
{"text":"Ordered in last week for a bunch of friends that stopped by over the holidays.  I called the order in at 5 and arranged for delivery at 730pm.  The order was on time, hot, and delicious.  We all commented on the delicious feast.  I'll order in more often from this restaurant."}
{"text":"This may be the very best Indian restaurant in Toronto. We got the Non-Veg Bhojan which comes with vegetable pakora appetizers, lamb curry, a peas and paneer dish, naan, refreshing raita, a GORGEOUS sizzling tandoori meat platter with chicken tandoor and beef and chicken kebab, with luscious kheer for dessert. All this for two people and we couldn't finish it all, there was so much! And how much? $40.99 before tax! It was delicious, authentic, and beautiful, and the staff are warm and attentive.  You're really missing out if you don't come here."}
{"text":"This place was good, but not great.   I order the chicken vindaloo, because I wanted something pretty spicy! The waiter warned us the dish was very spicy, but we said that is great -- just what we are looking for. However, the dish wasn't very spicy at all, I was disappointed.......  The palak paneer was strange, shreds of spanish instead of puree.   The chicken hariyali on the other hand was excellent -- best dish out of the night!  Would not return though, better indian places to go to."}
{"text":"Went to this place with my wife last Friday based on all the positive reviews that I read on Yelp. I have to agree with most Yelpers, this is definitely a gem of a place.  My wife had the Matar Paneer and I had one of the chicken dishes. Both of them were  very delicious and well prepared.  I'm only giving this place a 4 because we had to wait a few extra minutes for the waiter to get our orders. Otherwise I would have given this place a solid 5."}
{"text":"Great food and exceptional service. Our server was very kind and helped us with the ordering. You can ask for certain dishes to be made more or less spicy, too. The restaurant is very clean and we had a very pleasant dining experience here."}
{"text":"Nice north Indian food, good service, pleasant ambience.  I haven't tried the Nepalese menu items yet.  Their lunch buffet is very good value if you like straight-ahead north Indian."}
{"text":"I purchased a $30 GroupOn for $60 worth of Himalyan Food. I didn't realize this meant a mix of Indian and Nepalese cuisine till I got to the restaurant. I was greeted by a very polite waiter, and was seated promptly. They're not busy at all on a weekend night. The tables were set up like I was eating at a fancy five-star restaurant, but the interior design was very plain with a few paintings illustrating the Himalayan mountains/culture.   The appetizer we ordered was the Chef's Assortment, and all of the meat was dry. I did not enjoy that. Our main course came - the Chicken Tikki Masala and Lamb Roti - accompanied with Naan bread with minced meat in it. Now, that was delicious! I was so full, despite the portions looking small. I could have just skipped the appetizer. I ordered the Mango Lassi in the beginning which was very filling as well. The desserts were not so great. It was either way too sweet for me, or very tasteless.   I would come back for their lamb and naan bread because they're so noms! The service here is also excellent! I only wish they had parking. The area in front of the restaurant is for snow plowing, so take note not to park there!"}
{"text":"This place is great - nice food, not very expensive, usually easy to get a table, a nice mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes.  Highly recommend.  The service can be a little inattentive, though - but if you get their attention then they are very friendly and helpful, you just need to know that if you want something you need to wave someone over."}
{"text":"Amazing food  Great service  Reasonably priced buffet!   Sometimes they have a sitar guy playing. WOOO!"}
{"text":"This is an incredible restaurant for a delicious date.  The vibrant and subtle sauces, spices and flavors take you on a journey beyond the senses.  Especially if you're a student who eats elsewhere normally, the dinner for two special at about $30 is remarkably filling and memorable.  High rating but it is not an expensive place for power suits or celebrities - although you can feel like one if you dress like it."}
{"text":"After realizing Nepalese food is kind of like Indian food, but healthier, I was all in. Headed down for a date dinner before a show at the Bloor Theatre. I called ahead, but was told no reservation necessary, but by the end of the night all the good tables were full.  The Sitar player is quite good, but loud. Watch where they seat you, he may just be on break and then when the party gets started up again, boy are you in for a ear-ful.   I wanted to try the Nepalese specialties only. So, we ordered 2 naan and 2 dishes- the daal-like dish and the spinach dish. This was way more food than we could have eaten! But, considering we were headed to the theatre, didn't take any leftovers anyway.  But, price wise, the dinner for 2 is an amazing deal. If I ever go back, which is likely given our monthly Doc Soup at the Bloor, I'll go for that. As others  have said, the vegetarian dinner for 2 includes a beer per person, dessert, naan, rice, and 3 dishes!  One highlight of the night was the Paneer Naan we picked out. It was like ghee-covered Inidan Pizza! Fresh out of the Tandoori oven, I could have finished off 3 of those alone!"}
{"text":"Summary: was ok.   We ordered the following items:   - Mt. Everest Special Biryani 6/10  - Fish Pakora 4/10 no flavor, all batter  - Chicken pakora 4/10 red balls, all batter  - Lamb Tikka 3/10, overcooked, rubber, 6 tiny pieces for 17.99.  I do not recommend."}
{"text":"Delish.   Limiting my meat intake has brought me to fully appreciate a place that does meat justice. And justice Mt. Everest does.  I've sampled a few items here and there on the menu, but I feel like it's hard to go wrong. Tikka masala tends to be a crowd pleaser, and I'd recommend the appetizer plate if you want to sample. Don't both with rice or dessert, though you may want naan to compensate for the spice. And again, although I try to be veg most times, I would say abandon any such intentions here and embrace the perfect succulence that is their meat dishes.   Not a five though because it's a bit pricey yet fails to pull off the classy act (though it does try. E for effort?). Servers also tend to be a bit rude, which I can only ignore when prices are low enough to make me feel like I'm getting away with something.  Nevertheless, I will likely be back again when I am craving meat that is cooked as it should be."}
{"text":"Service: excellent.  Food: far behind all the other Indian places in the city.  We had a Groupon for this place.  We had been to their other location on Bloor and the food was good there, but the food here tastes far different and not nearly as good as their Bloor location.  Appetizer: Assorted Mains: Butter chicken, lamb ghost Desserts: Ras Malai, kulfi.  It's not awful or the worst or \"bad\", but Indian in Toronto has high standards.  Gotta keep up with the Joneses."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! Authentic Nepalese cuisine at reasonable prices. Good service, they are polite, attentive and very helpful.   To start we had Momo. this is an authentic Nepalese dumpling. It took a little while to get to us but totally worth the wait! I had the Chicken Jalfrejee, it was very flavorful, with just the right amount of spice. my partner had Lamb Vindaloo the lamb was very tender and cooked to perfection with the veggies though he would have liked more sauce with it. All in all a really nice meal.   i'll be going back soon!! :)"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular customer at this location and used to be one of my favourite until about 3 months ago, I noticed a change in the taste and freshness. I decided to give it another chance today and was surprised there were no customers inside and for a moment I thought not to get in but I finally convinced my self to do it. unfortunately things were even more disappointing than last time and this explains why the restaurant has no customer tonight. food was not fresh and prepared with old frying oil. I feel sorry to lose one of my favourite restaurants because I'm not coming back here."}
{"text":"I had a Groupon ($30 for $50 worth of food) and overall it was a good experience.   Pros  Most items are fairly priced  Good atmosphere  Great service   Cons -The butter chicken is tiny for the price you pay ($14) -I would not recommend the rice pudding desert (kheer) at all. It tastes like a bottle of essential oils with some rice.   When we called to make a reservation for 730 pm we were told to come earlier because it's booked for the whole evening. We got there at around 7 and stayed to 830 ish. There were maybe 4 other guests there. It wasn't even close to packed."}
{"text":"I have no idea what \"authentic\" Nepalese food tastes like. I've never been to Nepal. I have been to India and I can say that \"authentic\" is an if-y idea. Authentic to whom? The guy from Goa who loves pork sorpotel or the guy in Delhi who loves mutton biryani? You can order a dish in one city, then drive 100kms in any direction, order the same dish, only to find it tastes completely different. The point isn't 'is this \"authentic?\"', because that's very subjective. The question is, \"is it good\"?. And the answer is...YES!!! It's the best Indian food I've had in years. I just wish I had tried Mt Everest sooner!  Chicken Pakoras - AMAZING! Butter Chicken - CREAMY DREAMY GOODNESS Aloo Mutter - I'VE MISSED YOU SWEET PEA Paratha/Naan - TASTY WONDER BREAD Gulab Jamin (their spelling) - SPHERICAL SUCCOR    A little dramatic I know but I'm so excited to have found a great Indian restaurant uptown!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this restaurant for a prix fixe groupon.  We had veg samosas, which were a little dry, but okay. For entrees, we had butter chicken and aloo gobi.  Both were very good. You have the option to choose how spicy you want your meal.  We went with medium, but next time, we'll probably go for spicy. We were entitled to dessert, but we were SO FULL we skipped it this time.  We will go back - especially since they offered to let us do the prix fixe option again next time for the same Groupon price. Pretty clever of them. We went for standard Indian fare this round - I'd like to try some of the Nepalese specialties next time."}
{"text":"Deeelicoous!!!  Love the medium spice chicken here and lamb! So flavourful and mouth watering. Service is a little slow but for a chill night when you are able to have a relaxing and chill dinner i highly recommend it. The portions are huge and you one hundred percent will have left overs and feel satisfied. Highly recommend. It's a tad expensive but the food portions are well worth it!"}
{"text":"so disappointed !  i had fairly high hopes for this place based on the yelp reviews id perused so i was very let down when it turned out that i had been mislead ...  first of all the good : the decor , if trying a little too hard to create a \"fine-dining\" type of atmosphere , is pleasant and i really liked the artwork on the walls featuring the nepalese (or indian ?) countryside .  the music was also nice traditional indian music .  the servers were very pleasant ; they kept their distance and didnt offer much banter but were kind , polite and attentive .  the bad :  THE FOOD !  after waiting quite a while in an empty restaurant to receive our order , we thought that maybe this was a good sign as some of our meal was being prepared \"fresh\" .  sadly this was not the case except maybe for the bindi masala which was slimy and undercooked .  the aloo gobi featured very hard cauliflower and stale tasting , dried out potatoes .  most disappointing was the butter chicken which was VERY tough and dry .  the sauce was not rich at all - definitely couldnt detect any butter and very little cream .  the tomatoes didnt lend any sweetness as they should but instead made the dish quite bitter .  the naan was okay .  if we hadnt had a discount through groupon , it would have felt like a complete rip-off .  the potions were VERY tiny and all four members of our party left very dissatisfied .  no offence to the other reviewers but im wondering if maybe the higher rating is partly due to the large student population in the area ; maybe this place is earning high praise from people who have little experience with indian food or what torontos competitive dining scene really has to offer ?"}
{"text":"The buffet is great, hard to go wrong with that.  From the menu, my favourite item is the tandoori lamb skewers.   Very flavourful, a lovely hint of onions and spices.  Staff have been reasonably friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent Nepalese cuisine. Quaint and modern furnishings serving up authentic Nepalese food at reasonable prices. Good service, although very inexperienced, but very nice and accommodating. (August 2, 2012)"}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff. Highly recommend this place for people seeking Indian / nepali food."}
{"text":"The place is brand new. We went there with a groupon, which was pretty nice. The prices are relatively fair, along the lines of 12$ for a Butter Chicken dinner, but you need to pay for Na'an and Rice, which would push the dinner cost to about 30$ each. Also, I made an appointment for 8 people, but they had it wrong and only put me down for 2. I don't know how that would happen. They did end up putting two tables together and made enough room for everyone. The dinner took quite a long time to come, I'm talking about 40 minutes or so. Note, that the restaurant was packed. It seemed everyone was there with groupons. The best part about this place is the food. It was delicious, and would love to try it again.  I also don't understand why they would move so close to their other franchise. If it was closer to my area, I would have probably visited again."}
{"text":"I have only good things to say about my first experience at the Mt Everest Restaurant.  First of all the customer experience was fantastic. My table was never neglected by one of the three waiters working when I was there. They were all helpful and attentive without being overly intrusive with me and my date. They also had some great recommendations (for someone unfamiliar with their menu) and every recommendation was absolutely fantastic.  I wouldn't usually go over my menu in a review but since I was so delighted by everything I thought I might as well.  The fish pakora for an appetizer was so delicate and cooked to perfection that it melted in my mouth. While the keema naan bread was just the right mixture of flavour and lightly baked texture, it paired so well with our meal.  For entrees I had the lamb boti kabab masala. I have never had this before so I honestly cannot compare it to a previous experience with this dish but the lamb was cooked perfectly and I love the spices and flavour of this dish. It had a nice heat to it.   My partner had the chicken biryani dish. Again, the chicken was cooked perfectly and the rice was as well. The flavour of the dish was balanced so well it was hard not to taste it a few times from my partners plate.   For dessert I had the gulab jamun. I've never had gulab jamun before so once again I cannot compare it to any previous experience but at first bite I knew this would not be the last time eating it. For those unfamiliar with this dessert it is a milk based dough in the shape of balls (about the size of chicken balls) served in a bowl with a syrup that is made with a selection of spices. The flavour and the aftertaste from the gulab jamun was just amazing to my tongue. The texture and flavour were a perfect mix.   My partner had the kheer rice pudding. This had such a lovely combination of spices that worked so well together and contained a nice flavour burst without being overpowering.  I'm sure you can tell from my review that I enjoyed the meal at Mt. Everest restaurant and will definitely be returning. I highly recommend this restaurant and hope that any who go based on any of the reviews has the same wonderful experience as I did.  I will update this review if things change on my next visit."}
{"text":"This is 100% based on the lunch buffet experience:  -the food is foul. old leftovers- overpicked and not delicious. -the bread is stale -the selection is slightly pathetic compared to the queen street row of indian AYCE lunch buffets.    i'd give this place another try to redeem themselves and becasue i trust that yelpers aren't completely wrong but i fidn it hard to believe that experience was not typical."}
{"text":"What everyone else said!  I'd like to put a good word in for their mango lassi, too."}
{"text":"Dinner; Jan 15, 2011  Enjoyed a great meal with friends. The place was crowded and we waited 10 minutes (around 8 pm) My partner enjoyed the Chicken vindaloo.... way too spicy for me, but tasty... the butter chicken was one of the best I have had and the lamb saag was perfectly balanced. Don't bother with the appetizers, just order extra naan or other type of bread. Prices are decent the service impeccable."}
{"text":"We tried this out because our neighbor raved about it but this was a HUGE disappointment. Go somewhere else because there isn't a chance you'll be getting your money's worth. I can't begin to explain how badly they over charge...NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. The flavours are rich and vibrant, with all the spices and herbs tingling every taste bud. Everything is reasonably priced so there's no fear of feasting on wanky food for two hours only to have to go to Pizza Pizza afterwards."}
{"text":"Mt Everest turned out to be yet another Indian restaurant in Toronto, failing miserable at curries and mains. The tandoori starters were alright. The naan was poorly made, and the curries we ordered were not even close to what they were supposed to be.   Why are all the lamb curries yellow, watery, flavourless, and full of veggies that don't even belong in the dish?   If you want to have tandoori starters, you can surely come here. They're nothing special, but they are no disaster either.   My desperate search for quality and authentic Indian food in Toronto continues."}
{"text":"Came here with a groupon. Had their vindaloo chicken (spicy) and coconut creamy chicken (very mild). I enjoyed the vindaloo, there was adequate amounts of chicken with a mixed variety of veggies in the curry, and I finished the whole thing. :)  We only tried the dishes on their indian menu. Next time, I would come back to try their Nepalese menu items. For value, it cant be beat.  Mango lassi was a tad liquid-y, would be good to add some small mango chunks for a thicker consistency like I usually prefer."}
{"text":"Really like this neighbourhood joint. Kind of similar to Indian food. Good flavours. Palak Paneer and chicken tikka are tasty. The owners are super nice too. Will def keep coming back."}
{"text":"I had a groupon for $50 worth of takeout and I would say the picture I uploaded speaks for itself.  Everything with tax came up to $59.29.  The amount of food that you receive for $50 is definitely not worth it, if you pay the full price.  You don't even get naan or rice with the main dishes.  I called in my order and I was not asked what level of spice I would like.  The food is very flavourful.  Although the food was flavourful, I cannot imagine purchasing here full price because of the mediocre servings provided."}
{"text":"VERY TINY SERVING SIZE BUT WONDERFUL FOOD, CASUAL ATMOSPHERE  We went for dinner where I understand, it is significantly more expensive.  Pros: * many wonderful flavours and lots of choice.  (Just be warned the vindaloo is very, very spicy). * the garlic naan was scrumptious.  Cons: * None of the entrees come with naan/rice.  Each entree comes in a small metal bowl that is about 3 in diameter and 1.5 in height.  So that's about $11 for a tiny bowl of vegetables or about $15 for a few little cubes of meat in a bit of sauce. * The waiter is a bit pushy about asking you to order more entrees and rice/naan than you think you need. * In the end, we were full but mostly due to the naan and water (remember the spicy vindaloo!) not from the tiny entrees. * When we made the reservation, they insisted we come 1 hr earlier even though the restaurant was not full at our desired time.  (We read similar reviews from other diners).  Came out to $33 per person (one juice/beer per person, no coffee/dessert) for what was mostly carbs."}
{"text":"With the temperature reaching a seasonal low -25 last week, we decided it wisest to order lunch to the office. I combed the online delivery options available and developed a taste for Indian food. I thought a little spice would warm me up - I was starting to feel like Michael Keaton in the unanimously critically acclaimed film, Jack Frost (imdb rating: 5.0).  Based on the positive reviews here for Mt Everest, and being that I've never had Nepalese food before, I pushed to give it a try. We only ordered some garlic naan, plain rice, and two entrees:  1. Aloo Tama Bodi (potatoes, bamboo shoots, and black beans in mountain spices) 2. Malai Kofta (Cottage Cheese with vegetables in a cashew sauce)  The dishes were both tasty! I really enjoyed the Aloo Tama Bodi's flavour, and the Malai Kofta was also delicious.  Additionally, I was happy with the amount of Naan and rice we received in a single order. There was more than enough to cover both dishes. The ratio of bread or rice needed to cover a dish at Mt Everest is clearly 1:1.  Which brings me to why my review is only 2 star. The portions! First of all, the Malai Kofta only came with about 3 small cubes of cheese. Both dishes came in small, unfilled containers (sadly Instagram deleted our photo evidence) and compared to Indian portions elsewhere (and the price) we were disappointed.   Flavour-wise, I actually would recommend. However, it's likely that in-restaurant portions would be more significant and provide better value, so I wouldn't advise getting takeout."}
{"text":"This is definitely a find. D and I decided to come here for dinner, as our Chinese New Year dinner this year (I know I am a little late with my review ... and I know Chinese New Year was a while ago). We were supposed to go to dinner with a group of friends in Mississauga that day, but D was late in getting out of a work conference and the traffic was extremely terrible that day. So we ended up here for dinner. I have been here one other time with a girlfriend a long time ago.   Note, if you drive, you will need to find street parking in the side streets behind the restaurant. There are no parking lot for the restaurant. So street parking.   The servers here are all very nice and friendly. I also like that fact that they are not overly attentive either - just the right amount of attention I would say, leaving us to enjoy our food in peace. The place is very neat and the seating is well spaced out, so it was a nice and comfortable ambiance.   Before you food comes, they give you a small bread basket with some their in house jams. The bread is like chips. This with the jams are really good.   We ordered two dishes - one was a lamb and one was chicken (unfortunately, I don't remember the names of the dishes because D did all the ordering ....). We also ordered Paratha and Naan - you can find these in the Bread section of their menu. The breads are SO SO GOOD!!! It came out fresh and hot - SO Good. I actually prefer eating the two main dishes that we ordered with the breads versus rice.   I would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Wow. The dinner is infinitely better than the lunch buffet. My friend and I split the meat bhojan for two. (Delicious and far better than Roti Cuisine - though rotis shouldn't really be compared with real restaurant style food).  We added a bottle of wine and stuffed ourselves silly. The tandoori chicken hit all the right notes - I could taste the hint of lime from the marinade. Perfection. The bill wasn't bad. The meat bhojan was 38, the wine was probably another $30 - 40, and somehow our total was just over a hundred."}
{"text":"The food is tasty but the service is impossibly slow.  Bring a snack to eat while you wait for your food if you're hungry.  The serves actively avoided our table as we tried to wave them down to get the status of our food that took more than an hour. Overall this meal was not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Id advise going on a weekday if you plan on going for dinner. On weekends, even with a reservation we waited 20 minutes for a table for 2. we then sat at that table for 10 minutes before even getting a glass of water.  the food overall was quite good, from the apps to the mains, this would be a 4 star experience.  but the service was brutal by being both unattentive and slow. honestly when the glasses on the table are empty, I expect someone to be taking my next drink order asap.   So because the service is 2/5 and the food is 4/5 I'll give this a 3/5 overall."}
{"text":"The food was good and have and I have no complaints. I was hoping for food that differentiated itself a bit more from Indian and that's why I'm only giving it 3 stars.  Overall it was good but not memorable."}
{"text":"Good food, exceptionally slow service! The restaurant has very good food. We had vegetarian momos, bhuteko cauli, aloo tama bodi & masala naans.  The service is friendly but slow. For dessert the rasmalai & kheer were very good. The gulab jamuns were the worst that I've ever had in my life. I sent it back & got kheer. They were good enough to give it to me on the house.  A good restaurant for Nepali food but not a place to go when you are very hungry. Take out might be a better option."}
{"text":"We waited for-ever.  Accompanied by a Nepalese friend we were here to try the Nepalese section of a mostly Indian focused menu.    The Choyela chicken appetizer was fantastic; nice to try a different spice flavor than the usual Indian spices we're now accustomed to.  Khasi Ko Maasu goat was the Nepalese non-vegetarian entree I went with.  The menu de-emphasizes meat and lists it second; how dare they."}
{"text":"Me and my friend wanted to dine on some Indian food over a movie. I had previously gone to Mt. Everest for the lunch buffet and found it decent enough to order delivery.   I ordered butter chicken, naan and drinks. The delivery was done in 30 minutes which is very good when compared to delivery times of other Indian restaurants.   The food:  1. Butter Chicken: Delivery quantity was very small when compared to the actual dine-in quantity. The chicken tasted as if it was just put into the butter chicken gravy and served. We wouldn't have cared much if only the gravy tasted good. Being an Indian, I can easily differentiate good butter chicken from the rest. Unfortunately, this wasn't the best I have had in Toronto.   3 out 5 stars.  2. Naan: The Naan was a horror story. It wasn't cooked well. I could taste the raw flour which made them inedible for us. Apart from that, the naan smelled very bad.   0 out 5 stars.  We had to throw out the naan and ate the butter chicken with bread. Totally ruined the evening for us."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch in Leaside! They have a $9.99 special for two meat entrees or $8.99 vegetarian options served with rice, salad, naan/roti as well as a pop and even dessert. I don't think you can find a better deal than that for this level of dining. The restaurant is furnished very elegant and the waiters are very service-oriented. The only downfall is during lunch one waiter usually manages all the tables, which could be a little wait to get his attention. The food is very flavourful and I really appreciate how you can choose the level of spice here. I'm not someone who can have spicy food but I love Indian food so this was great for me!   I had the butter chicken and palak paneer options for my meal. The butter chicken was more red than the typical orangey colour you find elsewhere which I think is more authentic, so you can tell it's a tomato based sauce. The palak paneer was really creamy and they give you a LOT of paneer, which is always a nice bonus. The salad that comes with it is tomato and cucumber so it would be very refreshing for someone who orders a spicy version of the dishes. The naan is a little on the crunchy side and doesn't taste like it was \"fresh made to order\" as other joints follow. But still can't go wrong with the lunch combo deal here!"}
{"text":"Food is fine, the service from the lady was really rude and unprofessional.   She should learn to treat everyone with respect.   Definitely never returning"}
{"text":"Give me some mo' MoMos! I didn't even know MoMos existed. A Nepalese spiced dumpling that will change your life! We ordered frozen ones to go. The owner gave us instructions on how to prepare the frozen ones and then a few minutes later, came by with the instructions written down just for us. Great hospitality, great culinary experience. It's a subtle little place in a strip-plaza on Eglinton, but genuinely special. Make sure you stop in here."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for dinner, and every time I've been happy with the service and quality of the food. This place gets busy, so make sure to call in and get a reso if you think you'll need one.   When I feel like Indian, this is the place I go to!"}
{"text":"The food was quite good and the menu had a nice variety.  I leaned more toward the Nepalese choices because it's easy enough to find Indian fare around the city, but Nepalese cuisine is more rare.  Really good.  I guess my main concern is with the slow service.  We ordered drinks (nothing fancy--just a Coke and bottle of beer) and had to wait more than 15 minutes.  And we were the only customers.  Half way through the meal we ordered a single, second drink and more than 10 minutes had passed before I had to get up and remind the wait staff.  Frustrating.  I can understand slower service if the place is really busy, but not when the place has only one table to attend to."}
{"text":"With as imposing a name as Mount Everest, you might think that this Nepalese restaurant would be a place of epic food proportions. But instead of table-sagging selections of meat, rice, and heavy sauce, we left here after dining feeling full but not overwhelmed by the experience. It's a good place to come for creative and well-crafted North Indian food that will not leave a mark or make too heavy of an impression.    The dishes we ordered included a delicious portion of Aloo Tama Bodi (\"Potatoes, bamboo shoots, and black-eyed beans cooked with mountain spices.\") and a vegetarian tasting menu for two. The naan was excellent, as other reviewers have mentioned. The service was efficient, friendly, and elegant. The wine was an Argentinian Pinot Noir from Patagonia, pleasantly different from the norm. It fit well the food that was familiar but with a slight variation in presentation, spice, and flavor that made things interesting without being too intense.  I kind of liked the balance here. Nothing was overdone. Everything was savory and satisfying. It made for a very pleasant meal. And that's something to celebrate."}
{"text":"this is a nice spacious restaurant with low lighting and simple but nice decor, nothing all that memorable, but clean nonetheless.  we ordered the Non-Vegetarian Bhojan for two and to start we ordered the chicken momos.  so we had a mixture of indian and nepalese food.   the momos were absolutely deeeelicious.  they dough was cooked well (maybe slightly overdone, but if so just barely) so that it was soft and not overly chewy.  the filling inside was tender pieces of chicken and spinach i think.  that was very tangy, like it had soup inside or something.  then the waiter brought us one part of a our Bhojan.  that had a couple different kinds of chicken, like the tandoori, some boti kebab - which might have been beef or lamb, not sure.  the chicken was surprisingly tender and tasty in both forms.  the lamb/beef both in its form here and in the lamb curry to follow were overdone and too chewy, too rubbery.  what was to follow was the lamb curry, the mutter paneer, a raita and a couple of rice puddings for desert.  the sauces were pretty great, the accompanying veggies (though not substantial) were tasty, as they had absorbed the juices and accompanying sauces and spices of the meats.  the rice puddings were fine, tasty, but i dont think itd be my first pick of deserts in general.  all that was accompanied by 2 kingfisher beers a piece.  id like to come back here again, but id focus specifically on the nepalese dishes."}
{"text":"Went for the $8.99 lunch buffet, and thought everything was quite tasty and high-quality. Flavorful with mild hotness.  My only complaint was the number of small bones in the goat curry -- had to carefully chew to avoid hitting the many pieces of bone."}
{"text":"Really, really good.  They do Indian and Nepali, which is a great combo since I haven't had too much exposure to Nepali food yet, and I've discovered that I love it.  Momo Dumplings FTW.  The lunch buffet isn't the cheapest ever, but it's all-you-can-eat, so skip breakfast!  They are a lot more careful with food preparation for dinner (i.e. meat is boneless, selection is better) but you know what?  I get the lunch buffet anyway, since it's just so tasty.  We never manage to spend under $50, which is a shame since I'd like to incorporate this restaurant into daily life.  However, for a treat, this place is definitely classier than its price range specifies.  Friendly, undervalued/underrated, tasty, and tasteful.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for dinner using a Groupon. It was the best decision. We have never tasted Nepali food but it was amazing. We did some difficulty finding the restaurant because the sign is down. Although we did easily find off street parking. They begin your meal with a crispy bread (can't remember the name) with three different dipping sauces. I decided to order a vegetarian dish Bhuteko Cauli (spicy level) and my husband ordered the Kukhura Ko Maasu (chicken with bone). We ordered one side of Peas Pulaski and Naan-which is enough for two people to share. The food was delicious and the wine/beer menu complimented the food. All the servers were very attentive and helpful with food suggestions."}
{"text":"My curiousness killed me when I saw this place has coupon online. $25 for 50$ worth! Worth it! Even if I have to pay for regular price to come here, I still do it. I parked on the small street behind and I can smelled the food from distance! The staffs are super nice and friendly but because they don't have enough people so they might be slow in cleaning part. Food, however, is fresh make so you might wait have little bit so just feel free chit chat and have some appetizer while you are waiting. Lot's of people come in around dinner time. To be safe, just make reservation so they can keep your spot. Enjoy the pretty awesome food."}
{"text":"Go there for the lunch special-$10 gets you a huge amount of food that you choose from a sort of prix fixe type menu. I got butter chicken, tikka masala, salad, rice, pop, naan, dessert. I have also gotten takeout there a few times but it's MUCH pricier after lunch. Good staff. If you like spicy, ask them to spice it up-they'll blow your face off!"}
{"text":"To start off, I'd like to say I often buy Groupons to different restaurants and like to experience different foods. I particularly like Indian food (garlic naans, butter chicken, mango lasi, Mmmm).  I went to this place with my girlfriend for dinner using my Groupon. We were allowed an appetizer, two entrees, rice, bread, and two deserts. In addition, we also ordered a mango lassi and red wine. The place was fairly crowded and I had a reservation made ahead of time.  Overall, the service was extraordinary and the waiters were very courteous. However, the food was far from good. I ordered Nepalese goat meat while my girlfriend got the lamb masala. We also had pea rice, garlic naan, and nepalese fries. The entrees were not even hot and they tasted OK, although neither myself nor my girlfriend really enjoyed either one of the entrees. I've been to much better indian restaurants around Toronto. The worst part is that both of us had mild stomach upset all throughout the night and the next day. And the food just felt 'heavy'.  So we won't be going there again. By the way, all the food with taxes and tips ended up being $60 WITH the Groupon, which is not really on the cheap side either. So in my opinion - not worth it."}
{"text":"Went here with a groupon coupon. We ordered a kebab platter for the appetizers which was just alright. For the mains we ordered chicken tikka masala and lamb roganjosh with some naan breads. Both the chicken and lamb dish were disasters. Gravy was full of bell peppers when they are not even supposed to go in the dish. Roganjosh was a tatal failure too with watery gravy. Nothing even close to indian food. Naan breads were alright.  Wouldn't go back again to waste my money. There are some better options in the city so my advice is avoid if you can."}
{"text":"What a very nice place at Bloor Street west . You can have a nice buffet with a great selection of Indian food or you can order from the menu. I recommend the garlic naan and the mango lassi."}
{"text":"The takeout from this place hit Great Heights with their chicken tikka masala which was the most delicious sauce and the most tender chicken I've had an Indian food in the neighborhood. And then it hit a valley of lows with the vegetable samosas which contained no vegetables except potatoes, pakoras which were not very tasty and not very crispy, and the Goat that was included that was dry and stringy. the Samosa sauce was like water and very sour not sweet enough. However the other sauce a green cilantro and onion sauce was really delicious and I mixed it into a salsa few days later. Conflicted on if i would order from here again. I love the tikka masala but it bothers me that I have to spend $25 for delivery because I couldn't find anything else on the menu worth ordering. Even the naan bread looked had the look of something that was undercooked and when I tried to heat it in the oven it became really hard. Highs and lows and not a lot in between. I would not order the Chef's special appetizer again but if I'm nearby i might stop in fir the Tikka to go."}
{"text":"I can't remember the name of my dish but it was a Northern Indian specialty with ginger and a blend of unique spices. It was one of the best meals I ever had.  The place is nice and quiet and the servers were friendly and efficient.  I hope my  fiancée's friends from Toronto get married so we can eat at this restaurant again"}
{"text":"We went there for weekend lunch. It's more like mix restaurant where they serve Indian and Nepalese food. We wanted to try Nepalese food so we only ordered Nepalese speciality.  The service was prompt and the staff was really courteous. We were seated promptly and they explained the dishes well.  Food was tasty. Good taste and very good aroma. It's more like Indian food with different spices. So if you have tried Punjabi food, don't confuse this one with that. But it's more like Indian food with different spices. Overall we enjoyed it and will go back again."}
{"text":"Tried the shrimp jalfrezi. Quite delish and they give the most generous amount of shrimps ever in a restaurant. I counted at least 12 large shrimps! Unparalleled!"}
{"text":"This is a review based on take-away food ordered on Just Eat and I should also say that I'm most familiar with Indian food from my home in the North East of England and it seems the flavour palate may be quite differet.  I found the Vindaloo to have sufficient heat but to be more sour than I might expect and I found the meat (chicken) to be oddly fatty.  Jal Farasi was somewhat bland and again the meat was fatty.  Vegetable Biriani had rice and vegetables but came without sauce... is this normal in Canadian versions of the dish? It had more bite than I expected but was okay.   Nan and pompoms were 'meh' and, at least by the time they reached us, the Onion Bhajis we're soggy.  To be honest if I was scoring this against what I'm used to in the UK it would scrape 2 stars but some of that may be just what I'm used to so i've opted for a generous 3 stars.  Overall I'd say it was edible but uninspiring."}
{"text":"I've looked forward to trying the Mt Everest restaurant for quite a while.  It was recommended to me by several friends.  I went and had some Nepalese fair.   They server Nepalese and Himalayan food.They also server some of the more familiar Indian dishes.  I ordered goat, and some dahl.  I found the goat was cooked to the right texture, but the sauce was missing something.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't inspired either.  It was just there.  I found the Dahl was bland. I've had the yellow dahl before at several restaurants.  It need a little something.  I found it very mild and needing something.  I will go back again, and give them another try.  My friends seem to enjoy going there, so maybe I need to find out what they ordered so I can enjoy it too."}
{"text":"Pretty good nepalese food. The portions are a bit small so go for an appetizer to go along with your entree. Went for a la cart dinner but they also have a lunch only buffet that looks like it's worth checking out.  There's an extensive tandoori portion of the menu which looks very interesting. I will have to try that next time."}
{"text":"We came here yesterday the server was very nice and polite. We came in a group of three and the bill came up to about $70. We found the price range to be similar to other Indian restaurants. The food was very good! We got mainly the Nepalese dishes and they were amazing! Most people here mentioned that the portion sizes were small but I thought it was reasonably sized. Overall good restaurant with good food and a great experience!   Tip: if you are going to get certain curries, it's best if you order some type of naan/poori/rice to eat with it as it doesn't usually come with it."}
{"text":"Came here because of a Groupon I got and our experience was great.  The first thing I noticed was that the dishes/glasses/cutlery were spotless.  Always a good sign.  The service was superb.  There was always someone around if you needed anything.  And my personal favorite - my glass of water was filled quite often without me having to ask.  Drink wise the mango lasi was the best I've ever had, anywhere.  As for the food it was superb - especially the lamb dish and even their garlic naan.  The only downside was that one of their \"recommended\" Nepalese dishes wasn't anything special at all.  And to end things off both deserts we had were also very good.  This has become our new, go to, Indian restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"We used our Groupon for lunch and had one of the best Indian meals of all time. The food was absolutely delicious and so plentiful that we had to take part of it home in a doggy bag. The service was good, the atmosphere pleasant, and again, the food tasty and full of flavour. We will be going again when we're in the area."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a weekday and the live music was great, makes the experience much more enjoyable.  The service was good and not too over-the-top.  We loved the curry chicken, the garlic naan was good too, but I prefer regular naan.  Their spicy shrimp was very flavourful.  The quality of the dishes was very high.  The portions are much smaller than what I am used to at other Indian places though and it's a bit pricey too.  Overall, it was great though, I'd come back."}
{"text":"Everest is probably my favorite restaurant in Toronto.  The service is great, the decor is contemporary and the food is superb.  I highly recommend the Aloo Tama Bodi, Chicken Momos, the Lamb Vindaloo, Panir Tikka and the Chicken Tikka Masala.  Some of the best dining service I've had and the food is unique and of high quality."}
{"text":"I have tried a ton of Indian food but never had the pleasure to Nepalese so I was instantly excited to try out this place.  The decor was nice and understated. Waiters were super attendant and polite!  So off to a good start.  What we ordered: Momos Jhane ko dal Aloo tama bodi Lamb Briyani Raita  When asked how hot - we selected medium. Im not a fan of super hot - I much prefer deep rich flavour. We were assured that medium would be the right selection (mild - too bland, and hot would have too much heat). They were right. The medium was perfect - deep rich flavours and just a hint of warmth which is perfect on a cold day.  The food itself was cooked to perfection. The lamb was cooked enough to be \"cooked\" but still melt in your mouth soft.   Aloo tami bodi was a potato dish with bamboo and black-eyed peas in a rich yummy sauce. The momos came with a lentil mustard sauce that my companion ate with a spoon (it was that good).  Even with many alcoholic drinks the final tally was quite inexpensive! Which is rare for a unique dining experience downtown.  I give it 4 stars only because I have no base of reference to know if this is the best of the best of Nepalese food - but it was definately fantastic and I will be back again (and again and again)."}
{"text":"I ended up at this place accidentally. I met my friend nearby, and I had told them of a place I wanted to try out on Bloor. (they thought I was referring to a place that they walk by that is always dead, but I wasn't) and so they quickly were like... here's an Indian place... let's go here.  The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. There is tastier Indian food out there, and in larger portions too. From reading the reviews, I should have went for the lunch buffet. As I paid 20 dollars and left hungry... but again, I came to this place accidentally."}
{"text":"I love this place, especially since it's about a thousand times better than the dreadful Everest Resto on Queen West. They are not affiliated in any way but people still confuse the two because of the name. ANYhow -this place actually offers REAL service and food that tastes amazing - what a concept!  The naan bread is perfectly fresh and everything we ordered was delicious. I can't believe this was the first place I've tried Baingan Bharta (Eggplant Curry) ...definitely going back for more next time.  The waitstaff are all friendly and make you feel relaxed. They even seem happy to work here, which is pretty cool. Oh - and the bathrooms are sparkling clean. Not that it's the first thing on your list but I'm just saying..."}
{"text":"Me and my spouse stopped in here while we were waiting for our omnimax movie to start at the science center. Completely blown away by how good the food was and the service was exceptional."}
{"text":"Took me a while to drop in to this place. I'm glad i did!  They have a pretty nice Lunch special going on that will hit the spot. Consists of 2 meats of your choice, rice, salad, yogurt, naan or roti, desert. Even includes a pop for $10. Lots of flavor for your pallet. Left me pretty full The vegetarian special is only $9 and looks just as good.  Definitely will be stopping in more often. Will have to drop in for dinner to check out the other dishes on the menu.  Nice friendly staff/owner, very clean snazzy place. A good addition to the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Good food and the best-looking waiters in Toronto.   Gotta go there at least once a year.  The only Nepalese resto in town (used to be, haven't heard of any others opening) - so it's interesting to compare the flavours to some of the north Indian tastes in Little India.  Stay away from the stinky traditional Nepalese thing in the veggie combo - even some of the waiters say they can't stand the taste/smell - kinda like you imagine sweaty sneakers would taste.   Overall, a really nice addition to the Annex when it opened.  Still a reliable place for a pleasant meal in a clean resto.  If you've never had Nepalese food, it is a bit of a must do."}
{"text":"I had lived at Bloor and Spadina for many years and never tried the place, but finally got to last week... I absolutely love this place now. Like, seriously best Indian food ever!  The server was AWESOME. My girlfriend had never eaten indian food in her life and she was quite scared of the \"spicy\". I had made it my mission that the first Indian restaurant she tried would have to be the best if I wanted to make a convert of her- and I was only going to get one chance at it... thankfully the server picked up on that and made some suggestions and was very kind explaining to her the signature dishes there. We got the Butter Chicken and the Chicken Tikki Masala (the server said the chef LOVES to make the Tiki Masala) and shared the rice and naan. While the Butter Chicken was good, the Tikki Masala really did take the cake as just incredible.  Definitely going to go back there and try the buffet and very excited to know I'm in the delivery area.  Highly recommend this place! Didn't get to see the Sitar player on this trip, but would certainly be a great bonus to go on the night's they're playing there!"}
{"text":"The food is undoubtedly very, very good and perhaps the best Indian food I've had in Toronto so far. No complaints there. But it is overpriced. The restaurant itself is quite large.   I must comment that I disliked the service. One of the waiters was particularly rude, which comes as no surprise since Indians lack any semblance of tact (being Indian, I'm allowed to say that).   Ordered the Fish Pakora, and Shrimp Masala with Naan. It took about 30-40 minutes for my entree to arrive, and what's worse, is they got my order wrong. After they did so however, one of the servers questioned whether I had indeed ordered that. On the other hand, they did rectify the order immediately, and apologized for the mixup Everything I ordered was delicious. I recommend getting the Shrimp Masala. I would return here."}
{"text":"This place converted me to malai kofta, but the butter chicken is the piece de resistance. Come for lunch for a $10 buffet and enjoy an endless supply of their amazing rice pudding and naan, but be warned that the lunch butter chicken has lots of bones while the dinner a la carte butter chicken is made with boneless chicken breast."}
{"text":"Posted the following a couple weeks ago:  (four stars): \"Last week I wrote a review for Mt. Everest Restaurant expressing mixed opinions on Mt Everest: high quality food but at the cost of poor service (Refer to bottom of this review).  Within a matter of days, I was surprised to have received an extremely apologetic response via Yelp from the owners of Mt. Everest Restaurant.  They apologized for the inconvenience they may have caused my party, informed me that the staff was briefed about the situation and that new staff has been consequently hired, and offered me a coupon for my friends and me.    Although I have yet to go back (I'm pretty sure I would despite the disappointing service I faced the second time I went), I have decided to up the rating for the restaurant because I am entirely impressed by the fact that the restaurant owners are both concerned with and responsive to the opinions of their customers.\" ---  I went back with a group of five friends to Mt. Everest after claiming the coupon.  As they had promised, the service was much improved--the service was fast and the meal was as expected delicious. I'm pretty sure they were unaware that I had previously complained on yelp about their terrible service, so I'm hoping that my experience was unbiased. With their improved service and same excellent quality of food, I am changing my review to five stars.  --- Original review (three stars): \"Very very mixed opinions about this place.  1. The Food is amazing--both lunch buffet and dinner menu 2. The food is even better when the service isn't terribly slow.  After the first visit to Mt Everest for lunch buffet, I was utterly blown away by the quality of the food.  Unfortunately, I made the mistake of selecting Mt Everest for a class dinner two weeks later.  We waited an hour and change for our orders to materialize; by then we were late for class.    Unacceptably slow service.\""}
{"text":"Just not good. I fell into the trap of reading reviews from people who think they know good food. I've had street food in Mumbai better than this. Samosas were disgusting. Meat was extremely dry and not fresh and the sauces were poor. I write reviews yelp reviews so people don't fall into the same trap!"}
{"text":"Whether you want to get the $10 lunch buffet (such a good deal) or a night with a fine dining atmosphere without the fine dining price tag, this is for you.  Their food is excellent, really - especially during dinner time. Service is impeccable (they seriously make you feel like you're at a restaurant that would charge double the price) and prices are very reasonable.  The food at the lunch buffet is most likely just extra leftovers from the previous night so the tandoori chicken won't be as juicy and the naan not as fluffy/warm, but the curry is just as good. Either way, you can't get a better deal for $10.  Try the Lamb Vindaloo (very spicy) or the Chicken Korma!"}
{"text":"One of the best Indian/Nepali restaurants I've ever been to. Friendly staff, good food and reasonable price. I love the Fish Pakora as appetizer, ordered chicken biryani and boti kabab masala and both are excellent! Their gulab jamun dessert is sweet and delicious. Worth the try! I'd definitely go back again. And again!"}
{"text":"It's a pleasant atmosphere to dine in. I liked the paintings of Nepal on the walls as well as the post cards near the door. They've clearly put in effort to make the place not look as tacky as the proverbial south asian restaurant, and for that I commend them.   The food is not bad per se, but it's pretty generic and forgettable. The Nepali portion of the menu is limited, and unfortunately the differences between the Indian and Nepali dishes were very minimal, for eg,: our server told us that the only difference between Bhuteko Cauli (Nepali Entree) and Aloo Ghobi (Indian Entree) was that the latter had potatoes in it! I understand that Nepali dishes aren't that different but to make the dishes taste the same is a bit ridiculous. They think that since no single table is going to order both the Nepali and Indian equivalents together, they can get away with making cosmetic changes to their dishes.  We ordered  Keema Samosas,  and the Nepalese Entrees: Aloo Tama Bodi (potatoes, lentils and bamboo shoots) and Khasi Ko Masu (goat meat with bone) and Ras Malai for dessert. The food was freshly prepared and piping hot. The Aloo Tama Bodi was quite bland and the Goat Meat curry tasted like generic Indian  goat curry. I was quite interested in the Aloo Tama Bodi primarily for the bamboo shoots and was saddened to see limp, noodl-y shoots in the bowl. Oh well. However, the Ras Malai was very good: delicately sweet, milky and cool.  The service was good except that they mixed up our order, but that was corrected in a jiffy.  Dinner for two came to about $ 52 with tip and tax. Pretty expensive for a very middling experience.  I'd have liked them to put more effort in their food than their decor."}
{"text":"i ordered for pick up and got the daal and mountain potatoes. both dishes were excellent, really quite tasty. i'm impressed. what i'm not impressed with is the prices -- it's just hard for me to fathom such prices for a small amount of desi food.  i hear the lunch buffet is much better bang for your buck, so i'll try that."}
{"text":"Good food. It was refreshing to come across MT Everest as it was different from most indian restaurants that survive on staple dishes like butter chicken but fail to deliver on everything else. I was quite pleased with their specialty dishes from Nepal and I would definitely eat there again. The atmosphere/decor tells another story, but that should not reflect your impression of the food which is the most important aspect of dining."}
{"text":"Ok, everyone else who has commented here needs to calm down a little bit.  Yes, this restaurant is nice, but come on...5 stars?  I split a non-vegetarian combo for 2 with my girlfriend and it was delicious.  In particular, the chicken from the tandoor was uncharacteristically juicy.  Typically, Indian restaurants dry the crap out of their chicken when they put it in the tandoor, and this is the strongest point in favour of this restaurant getting 4 stars.  The ambiance is where it looses a bit of cache for me.  There was a sort of awkward white guy playing a sitar in front of what must be the lunch-time buffet station.  There was just something about that scenario that screamed \"We're throwing the South Asian kitchen sink at you, what more could you want?  We have a sitar, Indian food, an inexpensive lunchtime buffet and waiters wearing bowties.\"  Don't get me wrong, I'd come back here in a second, especially to order more stuff from the tandoor or the delicious mataar paneer, but it is NOT a 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"Popped in here for dinner the other night. We ordered the non-veggie combo dinner for two which was just over $40. There was a lot of food for the money, but I wasn't wowed by any dish. The best thing was the lamb curry though to be honest, the lamb tasted a lot like stewing beef. The service was mediocre. All in all, it wasn't a bad meal, but it did sit like a rock in my stomach for the rest of the night. As a side note, you can't use a groupon if you by a two for one dinner special, so if you are planning to cash your groupon, best order accordingly."}
{"text":"I've been to Mt Everest countless times over the years for their cheap buffet lunch (believe it costs $10.99 now but back in the day it was only $8.99)  Tried out dinner here last week for the first time.   I find the menu slightly overpriced. Most of the curries were $15 and that did not include rice or naan. Given this is the ANNEX and the decor/ambiance of this place is quite underwhelming, I think they are overcharging by a few dollars. Other similar type places with much better food (Banjara) have a more reasonable price point.  My date and I ordered the Dinner for Two special ($36.99) which was definitely the most bang for your buck. You get a platter of tandoori chicken, boti kabob and chicken tikka (two pieces of each), a lamb curry, mutter paneer, peas pulav and 1 order of rice and 1 naan. Some kind of rice pudding for dessert too.  Food was pretty tasty, didn't blow my mind but was definitely good.  Service was bothersome for me - very spotty at this place. At times they were over topping off water every 5 minutes, and at other times we could not flag them down to get extra rice or the bill, etc.  Lunch buffet is still a great option!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here because of our $50 Groupon. We showed up around 5pm on a Monday evening, and we were the only patrons.  We sat down and ordered:  Mt. Everest Special Biryani - great spice, with big shrimps, and tender meats. This is one of our favourite dish.  Garlic Naan - a must have, you can smell the garlic and it tastes great  Himalayan Hunting - mix platter of tandoori chicken, seekh kebab, a tandoori shrimp, and some assortment of other chicken and beef. The tandoori shrimp and chicken were the highlight of the dish. We would come here, and order the tandoori shrimp and chicken as separate dishes.  Lamb Vindaloo - if you want some tang and major kick, this is your dish! I love the heat of the dish, and the lamb was fork tender. Delicious!  Bhindi Masala - a bit bland compared to other dishes that are packed with spice. But I still enjoyed it, more than my husband :)  Overall, we will be back! My husband and I agree it's one of the better Indian food within the GTA. It is WAY BETTER than Lahore Tikka (we don't understand why people go there)!"}
{"text":"Wow, um wow wow wow! I have lived near this restaurant for 6 years and never bothered to go in..why, I have no idea..it's a mystery.  Tonight, my husband and I ventured in, wanting to try something new out and let me just say, words cannot express how utterly delicious tasting the food is here!!  We selected the dinner for two and had plenty to eat, in fact, we overate, ensuring that there were no left overs.  We ended our meal with AMAZING mango juice...I'm so stuffed, I almost feel ill but it was well worth it.    The restaurant is moving elsewhere in the neighbourhood.  Wherever it ends up, I shall follow!!"}
{"text":"They specialise in Nepalese & Indian cuisine. The restaurant wasn't that busy when we went so we were seated right away. Its a quiet and cozy restaurant with a nice ambience The server was very polite and attentive. We had the Mt Everest Special Biryani (which had mutton, chicken & shrimp), pappadams and the Himalayan hunt (I hope I got the name of the dish right) sizzling platter. Its basically mixed grilled meat and shrimp on a cast iron. The food was delicious and tasted very fresh. I really enjoyed the visit & definitely trying them again.   Tip:- Groupon has a offer going on for this restaurant. Give it a try, its worth it"}
{"text":"This is an ok Indian restaurant. Nothing too exceptional. The usual menu. They do have some Nepalese options. The service was pretty good. It wasn't too busy so we got seated pretty fast. The curries were pretty ok."}
{"text":"While the service was very good and the decor was passable, the food at Mt. Everest left a lot to be desired.  While the lunch buffet only cost $9.99, the food was very, very average. There were two meat dished, a few vegetarian dishes, and a small salad bar, so there was some variety, but the quality left a lot to be desired. The meat dishes were dry and cooked carelessly - the pieces of chicken looked like they'd been hacked at - and the veggies at the salad bar were dry and looked rather waxy. The only good dishes were the vegetarian ones, and while they tasted okay, it didn't feel like much care had been taken in their preparation.  Dinner, while much better, also came with a much steeper price tag. An order of tikka masala, rice, and naan set me back $16, and the portions of tikka masala and rice were truly very small for the price tag."}
{"text":"Great tasting food. A little bit expensive for the portion sizes. Love the khukara ko Masu and khasi ko Masu.  Discounts on cash take outs are great. They could do with less oil for sure. A lot of their gravies have excessive oil."}
{"text":"We went to Mt. Everest with some family the other day and had a great experience.  My girlfriend and I shared the Veg Bhojan which was plentiful and flavourful. Sizzling  tandoori vegetables, creamy dal and palak paneer, a plate of basmati rice with peas and naan. The rest of the family had Butter Chicken or Masala Shrimp, which I got to try because they were all full, and it was delicious. Though the meal wasn't quite spicy enough for me, the fans of milder food at the table had no problem, and there was still plenty of flavour.  Not only was the service fantastic, but our waiter made great suggestions regarding choices and portion sizes (GET THE BREAD BASKET), but they also brought out pakoras for the whole table even though it was just for the Bhojan.  It's too bad the metrolinx construction is blocking the door from Eglinton. More people should go here, and I can't wait to go back and try some of their Nepalese food."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend and a groupon coupon. The food was tasty, but it really just reminded me of Indian food. We had channa, lamb, garlic naan, and plain basmati rice. That was just enough for 2 persons, not to stuff anyone.."}
{"text":"Quaint and cozy place, great food , decent service. I've had better indian / Nepalese food ."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I last tasted the food from here. We didn't feel like going out the other day so we ordered for delivery. I couldn't be any more pleased!  The came right away and everything was delicious! I'll be going back soon! :)  Their Naan bread is to die for!"}
{"text":"I had a groupon for $50 worth of takeout à la carte. I pre-ordered butter chicken, baigan bharta (eggplant), chana masala (chick peas), peas pulau (basmati rice), chicken momos (Nepali dumplings), and some plain naan. The food was ready right on time, piping hot and packaged in leakproof plastic containers, a big plus.  The momos were the only Nepali dish I ordered. I have had them before elsewhere, and these were similarly pleasant - fresh, light, well-seasoned - and came with a very nice dipping sauce. Personally I prefer typical dim sum dumplings, but these momos make a nice sharable appetizer.  The guy who took my order asked me to specify spice level for each dish; so I chose a range. I kept the butter chicken mild; it had a nice tomato, creamy sauce with just a hint of sweetness (currants or raisins?). It was a good dish, but I have had better. The chana masala came with medium heat - another tasty tomato-based sauce with al dente chick peas. The eggplant - which I ordered spicy hot - was the best version of this dish I have ever tasted; a thick puree of roasted eggplant served with yet another tomato-based sauce. In retrospect, maybe I should have chosen a greater range of sauces. The pulau and naan were both fine, simple accompaniments.  All the dishes were served in generous portions, piping hot. The spice level was varied adeptly; spicy hot is noticeably hot, but nowhere near the point where you are desperate for a glass of water. I wish they would garnish with more than just a few leaves of cilantro; all the heavy sauces could use additional freshness that herbs impart. I would also suggest adding a raita or other side dishes.  When I arrived to pick up my order, a large table was finishing their meal, and they had nothing but raves and \"We'll be back\". Service, limited as it was in this takeout capacity, was fast and friendly. They even encouraged me to buy additional groupons, which is a welcome change.   I will definitely be back. This is a homey, student-y kind of place with good deals on pre-set meals. It is not fancy dining, but it fits in well with the Leaside area."}
{"text":"The restaurant sits on the south side of Bloor Street with glass windows looking out onto the street. Like most Toronto restaurants it is long and narrow. There is a bar when you enter that separates a section of tables at the front and some near the kitchen. The decor is dark and rich with lots of wood accents. When we arrived it was almost empty but while we were sitting it was full in no time. The staff was attentive and polite providing service when needed. The menu featured a selection of expected East-Indian and Nepalese dishes. We opted for some onion bhajis, a roti, a garlic naan, and two vindaloos. Although the bhajis were a little greasy and too salt everything else was delicious. It was what one would expect for a place frequented by locals from the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"The Chai chai is good here. Haven't been able to find this flavour at any other restaurant that I've tried. Ordered the eggplant and the traditional Nepalese chicken curries with roti and garlic naan in medium heat. Would order dishes with more heat next time. Food was tasty, service could be a bit friendlier but service was good. We were checked up on and water was refilled before cup was empty without fail. Environment is quiet but not upscale. They are currently offering 20% discount on takeaway orders, cash only."}
{"text":"I'll admit, I've never actually sat down at Mt Everest. One time a friend popped over with some leftovers that were so good I didn't know what to do with myself, but after ordering takeout, I am not impressed.  Okra is my favourite vegetable when it comes to Indian cuisine and I order it whenever I can. Mt Everest's bhindi masala over some uninspired rice left me satisfied (it's actually way better as reheated leftovers) and I enjoyed the nice spicy kick to it, but the garlic naan was flat out disappointing. I'm a bit of a garlic naan connoisseur and I am not quite sure what to even say about what I tried because there was not much to it. It wasn't garlicky in the slightest, not even buttery, and the naan's texture was dry, tasteless, and chewy in an unflattering way.  I am for sure willing to give Mt Everest a second shot because I walk past it all the time and would really like to try some of their other items, but first I need to recover from this meal that cost over $30 (two entrees, rice, and naan - really?) and a bit of an upset stomach."}
