{"text":"Best pizza in North Royalton! We love the cheese salad with creamy Italian. It is a little pricey but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"As for the pizza - five big stars. \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\"  The only down side is that there are 2 sizes - 6\" and 12\".   We want more!!  The toppings are generous, the pizza is cooked perfectly. As for the eat-in ambiance - four stars \"Yay! I'm a fan.\"  The waitresses we've had have been SUPER friendly.  I get the sense a few friends/relatives are working their tails off to keep this place alive.  And more than that, I'm guessing these people are good, ethical, friendly, regular folks.  (You just get treated as a perfect equal on 1st greeting, ya know?)  We're done shopping for \"our\" pizza joint.  Angie's is it.  We'll get carry-out when we want a 'za.  We'll do eat-in when we want to get out & be casual.  This place is unpretentious & that's great by us."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and salads, both dining in and to go are good!  Much better than Pizza Hut or Dominos for the same price."}
{"text":"Once upon a time there was a handsome Prince and the handsome Prince liked to......oh...sorry......wrong site.  Let's try this again  Once upon a time there was an excellent pizza being served at this establishment. Then they started making little changes to the crust and cheese. The excellent pizza that once was is no more.  The End"}
{"text":"Nice cozy neighborhood joint.  The pasta sauce was fresh, meatballs tasty and tender, and the portions were HUGE!"}
{"text":"We have been going here for years and the food and service are always great- last night was no exception. The fireplace always adds to the cozy atmosphere. It was a great spot to eat and talk with friends last night. The weather was finally great and other big name restaurants were crowded and loud. But we called, they were busy too but they could hold a table for us n it would be ready when we got there!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! Watch out Antonio's! Beer's served w/frosted mugs :-)  Service was excellent. No fruit flies flying around like some other places...aha...prices were good too. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love Angie's Pizza. They use an old-fashion pizza oven and it makes the pizza crust SO GOOD. It's family owned and they are always nice! There is plenty of room to sit inside and its seat yourself. They have great salads, which are big enough to be shared, and the pizzas are traditional and AMAZING. If you go with a group of people getting a pitcher of pop is worth while."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to Angie's pizza for the past 4-5 years and it is great every time.  The staff is very warm and friendly, the dining room is cozy and comfortable.    We always order a pepperoni pizza.  Love how they serve it on a raised silver platter.  Reminds me of the old school pizzeria.  Also they have the traditional paper place mats with the map of Italy.  Not sure why I like it but I do.    Sometimes I order a side salad with cheese.  It is a very generous portion and I usually end up taking half of it home.  We ordered for takeout once and it wasn't as good but eating it there when it is fresh out of the ovens is the best!!    Overall we highly recommend this great local pizza place!"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner with my four year old, which as anyone with kids knows can sometimes be quite hectic!  Our server was AMAZING!! She was so sweet and attentive to both of our needs. She interacted with my child like we were family!  The pizza and salad was delicious but the service really made the experience!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not typically and Angie's fan. They're fairly priced and their pizza is decent.   I did have the New York White Pizza last night, for the first time, and I was very pleased with it."}
{"text":"Really liked the pizza-for our first time there we got the heart shaped pizza.  Was delicious. The cheese salad was really good as well as garlic bread with cheese and prices are very reasonable. I give 5 stars for the food but the service has been kind of crappy.  Now I get why there are so many to-go orders.  Both times there were only a few people eating there and the service should have been much better.  I think we are going to get it to-go from now on."}
{"text":"I called twice for 20 minutes trying to place an order never got a chance to place it so needless to say very disappointed with the business"}
{"text":"Ordered from them for the first time tonight. Ordered delivery. Lady over the phone was very friendly. Pizza arrived within an hour as promised. Driver was friendly and pizza was ripping HOT!! We had to let it cool off for a few minutes before digging in. Very good pizza! Crust is amazing!!! Sauce and toppings are good too. My only complaint would be that I think there are actually too many toppings on the pizza! I know, crazy right? My son also ordered a side of Meatballs and sauce. They were ok, but not great. The price is unbeatable and we will definitely order again!!!"}
{"text":"My fianc√© called in an order for carryout yesterday, and based on the reviews I've read on google it seems dine in is the way to go. We ordered a 12\" with pepperoni and mushroom along with an order of hot wings. Was told 30 min for the wait time, seemed reasonable. After arriving home from our 3 minute drive home, we were greeted by a lukewarm pizza drowned in canned mushrooms and a box of the most miniscule wings I have ever laid eyes on.  Albeit, the taste of the pizza and the dough/crust was great, but the lackluster temperature and canned ingredients were truly disheartening."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza! I haven't actually been able to go and eat AT the place, only had the take out pizza.   As far as the taste; if you are a fan of crispy pizzas this place is the way to go.   Only down side is that their \"large\" pizza is only big enough to feed 1-2 people. If you've got a large crowd of folks make sure to buy more!!!"}
{"text":"Wow....went for lunch on a Tuesday the first person that we met was the hostess with a goth appearance . She didn't look ya in the eyes. She was rude and didn't smile or look up at all. The service and meal were great!   We went to check out and the hostess once again not at all customer service based personality! She huffed and took our money and as she gave us back our change...still with out looking up she said under her breath..\"there ya go\""}
{"text":"I came to Angie's tonight based on a recommendation from a co-worker. This was the best pizza that I have had in a long time. I don't know if it was because I was inebriated. They use a ferris wheel style oven which turns out to be one of my favorite cookers of pizza. I am really glad that I came out here today. The place was no frills on the inside. The beer selection was among the worst that I have ever seen. The service was outstanding. I drank a few beers before I ate here, had to use the bathroom. The bathroom was kind of jacked up and in need of repair. I could easily overlook it. One of my favorite pizzas in Cleveland!"}
