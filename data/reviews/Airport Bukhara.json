{"text":"Food is about average. They have a good selection of meat and veggie options. I recommend their samosas and butter chicken. Stay away from the tandoori as it's just bad. Cold and dry. They also provide fresh naan which is nice. Lunch is $10 which is very cheap for a buffet so you can't really go wrong with trying this place at least once.   Would come back since its cheap."}
{"text":"Been here for a few times for lunch buffet, which has north Indian and hakka cuisines. Tastewise, it is pretty good. The gravies are spicy enough. They do not have a good desert section or appetizers though. Most of the items are from main courses."}
{"text":"I did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised how good the food was. I was expecting typical bland buffet food (that accommodates the masses). The food is well spiced and the selection great. I frequently eat Indian food and there were items I had never tried before. Highly recommend except to those that can't handle spices."}
{"text":"I read the mixed reviews so I was coming with low expectations.  I had a groupon so I thought hey why not try.  I was still disappointed.  Buffet food is average.  Butter chicken was decent. Samoasas were super stale. Our naan was fresh and hot.  The ice cream had been totally melted and then re-frozen into this disgusting mess. I ordered masala chai from one waiter, waited 20 minutes and it never came, so I told another waitress about this and she said she'd get it, waited another 20 minutes and it still never came.  I'd rather pay full price and get decent service and enjoyable food, (but if you get a groupon and stick to some of the buffet items it could be an ok value)."}
{"text":"Really amazing and authentic food (yes, I've been to India so I can say that!). We came for their weekend brunch and it was extensive and an incredibly good deal. Worth the drive from Toronto, check it out!"}
{"text":"Purchased a groupon to try this place out.  I know its not a very high end restaurant but I expected decent quality food. I tried a few items. All of them tasted horrible except the shahi paneer and daal makhani. The non veg items were disgusting and very minimum(like 3) . I had to spit the chicken out because it smelled and tasted so bad. The dessert I tried was the rice pudding(kheer) which tasted as if the milk had gone bad. The service was also mediocre. They brought fizzless pop in a glass which I saw the waitress pour out of an old 2 L drink bottle. I would not recommend going here ever again."}
{"text":"I usually review the exceptionally good restaurants or the ones that turned out to be unexpectedly fabulous, leaving behind average ones. I take on to write this review not because I had a bad bad experience but to warn all not to venture there -STAY AWAY from this disgust of an Indian restaurant.  They choose to advertise thru Groupon to drive in business, which is a great by the way to get some new clientele, but then the way they go about things, they're driving all clientele out never for them to return back.  I visited them today, though a weekend, they were not busy at all. 4 tables max at any time. The first rude frown you get when you mention that you have a Groupon voucher. You're looked at indifferently and with no sense of welcome. Attitudes change instantly.  Once you get to a table, within minutes you start feeling stuffy. No AC, with temps over 35 degrees outside- are you kidding me. Requesting them to turn it on met with another frown and no, they did not turn it on.   Now comes the worse part - THE FOOD. Stale, spoilt, bland and spicy. And for a good 30 minutes they did not replace two of their 3 main dishes and the dessert. Along with myself, many other diners gave up waiting for the butter chicken and goat curry to arrive. The \"we don't care\" attitude was quite visible in everything. The vegetables were old and recycled at least a few times with an after taste. Reminded  the manager, who not only gave you a cold shoulder but was also getting agitated.  An absolute shame of a restaurant. Not sure why and how they are still in business. No customer service skills, sub par food quality and rudeness is written all over. Once again, stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Stay away! My husband and I went in for a Friday night dinner and ended up stale food and an upset stomach. I even requested that they remove the very stale dal makhni from the buffet because it wasn't even bordering on edible anymore. The waiter apologised and told the manager who did nothing about it. Please save yourself the food poisoning - go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Dirty place but the goat curry was good and the naan was delicious!!! They need to really stock up on everything and the food needs a better heating system. I would come here again but right when they open to get the freshest, unpicked through food. The people that come here are obviously all Indian and very bottom of the barrel. I felt comfortable eating only in the \"fine dining\" section because the small section where they put everyone for buffet was a complete and utter disaster to say the least. Tables were all left unclean and it's obvious the waitress doesn't like to clean at all, or for that matter, offer beverages. I would have given a 1 star if i wasn't jonsing for the goat curry, spinach sauce, and naan constantly...."}
{"text":"For the price I really like this place. It's basic but delicious. Go on Groupon get their two can dine offer and I'm sure you'll have no complaints.   samosas, pakoras, butter chicken and naan are all delicious!   The area is a little sketchy which is my only negative feedback"}
{"text":"Just save yourself and stay away! They don't even deserve 1 star.   We used them as our wedding caterers... all was good until the day of the wedding.  We were horribly disappointed. The food came 2 hours LATE from what we agreed and it didn't come all together - another thing we had specifically requested. - They claimed their truck wasn't big enough to carry all the food, but that was nonsense, I'm pretty sure their kitchen just wasn't big enough and they weren't honest with us in advance.  The service was just a nightmare, really ruined the evening, and we were so disappointed with the lack of respect and amount of apathy we received because of their tardiness. Not to  mention, along with this mess, they didn't even bring the appetizers we had ordered, they gave us other crap instead. They demanded we paid in full right then or there, or would get the authorities involved... Just a mess and no apology.  I would never recommend dealing with these guys for catering an event. I have no respect for them, which sucks because I actually did like their food and the OWNERS up until they screwed up my wedding reception -- Some of our out of town guests had flights to catch and missed out on dinner... just horrible. ALSO a hand full of our guests got really sick from their butter chicken.   FALSE PROMISES AND A MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT."}
{"text":"Actually I wanted to give them zero star....worst customer service in all GTA. Placed order in advance and then also have to wait for eternity for our food. Food arrived was also cold and wasn't close to average Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"Sad to see Airport Bukhara has bad reviews. I've been here many times and only had great experiences. The selection isn't huge but this has improved over the years and the price is unbeatable. They may have the best butter chicken that I've had and I like that they bring the naan fresh to your table. Also, they always leave a water pitcher which is especially helpful for me with spicy food!  In regards to the bad catering review here, I should note for what it's worth that I used to work for an event venue that once had Airport Bukhara as their caterer for a 2 day event. They were on time those days and the client seemed happy with their work."}
{"text":"Came to Airport Bukhara for lunch today with a Groupon. We had 8 people occupying 2 banquets at the front of the restaurant. The banquet seating was awkward. Very shallow seats and the table was too far, so you have to seat on the edge of your seat. Table/chair seating at the back would've been better. However, the back was a mess b/c of an large group of 45 that had arrived for an early lunch. The buffet tables are located along the sides of the main aisle which connects the entrance to the rest of the restaurant. So when very busy, as it was today, this made moving around very frustrating.  There was a limited but good selection of items in the buffet. I normally have a little of everything. Basmati rice, samosas, naan, chick pea/spinach/mixed veggie curries, butter chicken, goat curry, fish pakora, and of course gulab jamun for dessert. All dishes were solid. The fish pakora was really good, but they didn't have any tandoori chicken left while we were there. The goat curry, my favourite, was also good."}
{"text":"The one word to describe my experience here would be \"meh\". The naan bread tasted like reheated old naan. It was stale and chewy. Definitely wasn't fresh. Goat curry was mostly bone and hardly had any meat. Paneer tasted very firm, chewy, and overcooked. Dessert was extremely limited. Nothing stood out. Service was slow, with dirty plates sitting for a while. By the way, the Groupon is not a deal. You save about $1."}
{"text":"I posted a review last week but on visiting for the second time since then, the food and service were the same but the price for lunch was higher than last week by 20%. But here's where it got interesting.  When we asked why were charged $11.99 we were given a stuttered and uncertain reply. First it was \"The price is 9.99 per person plus gratuity and tax\" (their website says $8.99 but there was a sign posted indicating that prices went up on May 1st. And the tax was a separate line item on the check). When challenged that $9.99 times 2 plus HST does NOT equal $27, then the answer became that he's new and unsure how the system tallies things.  We wanted to confirm the new price of lunch was $9.99. He confirmed. Then we worked it up from there to $22.58, not $27.10. He then printed out the check to reveal the price was $11.99 (again, one week earlier it was $9.99, the new higher price, and $9.99 was the price he just confirmed). So why $11.99? Why were we not able to get a simple answer to that? Why were we told the price was $9.99 when we just asked, only to be billed $11.99, then told \"Oh yes, the price is $11.99\"?  Something was amiss. I can speculate, but I won't. I really hope that it was a mistake that was clumsily mishandled, but suffice it to say that we felt we were mistreated in the exchange and that leaves a sour taste in our mouths that overrides all else."}
{"text":"My family and friends have been eating here for years! The atmosphere is serene, the food consistently delicious and to top it off- \"Kids eat free\" on Tuesdays.....oh Joy!~   Not sure what there is to complain about, but you will not be disappointed. BTW: Order the samosas and some Malai Kofta....You're Welcome!"}
{"text":"The first thing to mention is.... It's NOT a fine dining. The ambiance and the look and feel marginally earns 2 stars.   The buffet has about 18 types of Indian items, plus 6 desserts. The quality of food is average. The nan is served freshly prepared hot from oven. Though they are really short staffed, but the staff who served us was quite polite."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Bought GroupOn for lunch buffet. I can simply say there was no food on table. Dont know what was the issue less staff or it was GroupOn issue. If they bring Naan there was no Sabzi. Only thing they had was Rice which was all time available. Simply big no."}
{"text":"Yum yum !   The food was really delicious and fresh.  The service was wonderful and the place clean.  The look of the place was what one might expect from a strip mall restaurant but what it lacked in its esthetic charm was made up for by its warm and friendly family of proprietors."}
{"text":"Not quite sure as to why this place is called Bukhara. Bukhara a city from greater Iran (Uzbekistan) and India is way in South Asia. Not to mention the name itself is confusing when I went thinking I'd have Persian food then I see it's an Indian restaurant. Misguiding people isn't the best way to handle business. Might want to learn to market and rebrand a bit better."}
{"text":"Food was good. This is authentic Indian food! I really enjoyed this! The staff was friendly and food was very nice! The food of this place is well worth the price!"}
{"text":"Went there. Food is okay. Waaayyyy too creamy and the only good things are naans. The fried fish was very greasy, the tandoori chicken was cold and rubber like. On top of that they added some 4.50 convince free or something and automatic tip of 15 % for crappy service and food. Wouldn't go there again. 1 star is only for the naans that's it."}
