{"text":"Food is OK. New management to replace old management who ran it into the ground is inexperienced in both the restaurant and bar side of it. They always have ads on Kijiji so it seems they can't keep staff.  Most of the people who frequent the place do so while under the influence of illegal substances.  Oh, and if you used to go here to play pool, you'll want to find somewhere else. The machines were taken out during renovations. They lost half of the original space to an arts store next door."}
{"text":"Ahhh... Shoeless Joe's. Your lack of service and quality food reminds me why I do not dine in chain restaurants.  I came here with my soccer team one night after our game. This location was rather empty, so we probably should've taken it as our cue to run the other way, but we didn't. That night, there was only one poor waitress running around and waiting on about 5 tables. When she came by to take our drink orders, I asked her what they had in terms of beers. The pitiful selection on tap and in cans (not that I wanted to resort to a can) led me to order a Corona for the night.    At about 8:20pm, the waitress came by to take our food orders. I had the wings and one of our teammates advised everyone that only the wings were worth eating here... anything else would be a giant mistake. Of course, some people decided not to listen, but I did. At about 9:10pm, almost an hour after we ordered, our food was FINALLY delivered to our table. I really didn't think it took that long to make wings, but apparently it did.   My wings were great and I enjoyed them. The fries were also good, a bit on the salty side, but it was fine. As for the people who decided not to order the wings, they wished they ordered wings about one bite into their meals. It was pretty hilarious. One of the guys on our team decided to have the braised beef burger which looked like a slop of meat on top of a burger patty. It wasn't the most appealing thing in the world.   Needless to say, we'll be listening to the guy that told us to just order the wings next time. He was definitely right."}
{"text":"Great little spot. Exactly what I expected. Food was good at a good price. Great service. The kids had fun playing pool."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner... or so I thought. We ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and a couple of drinks.  Service was quite slow... if the food was delicious, the wait would have been worth it, but....   Eek, me thinks not indeed. I'd rather spend my money at the Golden Arches than here."}
{"text":"I guess if you live in this area you deserve this uninspired mediocre sportsbar.   The Chefs Swanson, and Stouffer will nuke you up something nice to go with your choice of domestic brew.  After that satisfying meal and refreshing Molson product you can take your chances with any of their three midway like games.    Overall I'd describe this place as a post apocalyptic Dave and Busters."}
