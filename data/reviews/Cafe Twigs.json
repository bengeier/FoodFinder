{"text":"It's fun to go there sometimes and see the paintings/arts on the wall because they change it often. 
Warm atmosphere, affordable and good food. (The Marc is my favourite sandwich if you like buri cheese)"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a lunch, based on yelp reviews.  Small-ish place but easily found seating and placed our order quickly. Staff was friendly and helpful. Took a long time for three sandwiches, but every bit of the sandwiches were enjoyed. Forget the names of the sandwiches:  one was a turkey and cheese, one was a pizza sandwich, and one was a \"Thanksgiving\" sandwich - turkey, cranberry sauce, etc.  everything was fresh and plentiful, no skimping here. Tried two desserts, both were rich and dense. 

Overall I would probably recommend more for adults or a women's lunch, than for lunch with kids, but we enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"LOVE this local gem! Always delicious! And so cozy! The vegan sandwich they make me steals my heat and there's always vegan soup available!"}
{"text":"My favorite cafe next to the boardwalk. TWIGS (Two West Island GirlS) is my walk to comfort zone any day of the week. Friendly staff, decadent desserts and sugar free cookies (with honey...) o_O  Much love."}
{"text":"Bon petit café à Sainte Anne de Bellevue. Nourriture simple mais santé (chili, salade, sandwichs originaux) mais aussi de délicieux desserts. À essayer avec un bon thé ou un café chaud! 

Ambiance sans prétention, sûrement un des coins préférés des étudiants de John Abbott. J'ai beaucoup aimé!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and sandwich with a cozy atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Twigs is my favourite place to go. The food always tastes incredible, the staff is super friendly  and helpful, and the drinks are delicious. My favourite sandwich is the mark, but the Asian salad is also incredible. Always try the suggestion drink (usually available hot or iced) because it's always creative and delicious. The cakes are probably the best part. Most of them are 100%homemade so it's worth the 6$ per slice (splitting between 2 people is the perfect deal) . The prices are slightly high but it is definitely worth it for the size and goodness. The atmosphere is cozy and warm but it's pretty busy in the middle of the day so try and stop by at an off time. During the week there are always john abbott students."}
{"text":"What's not to like?

They have the best breakfast plate, best sandwiches, and best soup. People are kind, the place is cozy, and the coffee tastes wonderful."}
{"text":"Pourquoi? Délicieuse pâtisserie, sandwich 
très abordable, atmosphère et de grandes fenêtres qui laisse entrer le soleil. 
             
Vous recherchez un petit café plein de cachet au milieu d'un charmant petit village? Vous n'avez même pas à sortir de L'Ile de Montréal pour trouver un tel endroit.
Après une marche sur le boardwalk de Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, le Twigs est mon arrêt obligatoire. J'avoue que je ne suis pas seul.  Les places ensoleillés à l'avant du café, particulièrement le divan, vallent leur pesant d'or. Même si je viens de picniquer je NE PEU RESISTER à leur dessert. Tartes, gâteaux, brownies .... fait maison pour la plus part. 

Ambiance et musique relaxantes, oeuvres d'artistes locaux sur les murs, selection de porduits bio et locaux à vendre, soirées \"open mic\", poésie ....
Je ne crois pas qu'un café peu offrir plus dans les circonstances. 


J'ai toujours l'impression qu'un jour je surprendrai Tweek Tweak de South Park attendant nerveusement pour son \"Fix\" de caféine dans un coin sombre deTWIGS café! :)

Pour ceux que ça intéresse!!!
Dans le café une seul petite toillette. Quand le café est plein il faut être patient :) Elle est propre mais je ne sais trop pourquoi la toilette est sur un podium!!!   
Pour ceux avec un problème de motricité (exemple après 2hr de vélo) ehhhh....  bonne chance pour gravir la petite marche du #$&^%¥~;(  de podium."}
{"text":"Their custom grilled sandwiches and cakes are amazing!! Definitely try the carrot cake. Very warm and inviting atmosphere. Best cafe in St Anne!!"}
{"text":"Got the origins kombucha and my friends all got different frappes! Everything was delicious and they had free wifi and a clean washroom"}
{"text":"Went there this morning. Their breakfast sandwhich tasted fresh and were good. What suprised me was the tea. Usually in coffee places you get a tea bag dropped in a cup of mild water. Here it was actual tea leaves and the water was hot. I did not taste their desserts but they looked so good that I almost took some. Even if we were in the morning. All in all, a great experience"}
{"text":"Reculé à la pointe occidentale de l'île, le Café Twigs se conforme bien à l'imaginaire collectif d'une municipalité agreste, soit une hospitalité chaleureuse aux sourires sincères sur un fond de mercantile mesuré. J'ai apprécié que la caissière n'a pas poussé la vente. Il n'y a pas eu de 'un scone avec ça?'."}
{"text":"One of the few cafes in ste Anne, and frequently visited by students in the school year, and tourists in the summer. Cute place with paintings on the wall and local art. Staff is friendly, and sandwiches are pretty good...except for the tofu sandwich, in which the protein resembles a puck of rubber. My favorite is the Marc, though it was far better a few years back when they had actual chicken pieces and not the cheap deli meat. Cake is good, but its disappointing to find out that they DONT MAKE IT (outsourced). They dont make most of their pastries either! The brownies and some cookies were homemade but I found them lackluster.  Drinks are hit and miss."}
{"text":"TWIGS (stands for Two West Island Girls) is a Cafe located in Ste Anne de Bellevue in Montreal, QC.

While I love Saint Anne's for several reasons and it is home to several good restaurants, this cafe is one of my favorites.

The atmosphere is always very cozy and the menu is simply amazing.  They offer a wide range of sandwiches, soups, drinks and desserts.

Drinks include lattes, teas, coffees and smoothies.  The menu is full of healthy options and choices offered for vegetarians.

While they have their specialty sandwiches, you are also able to make your own!  This is what I always do while I am there.  My usual order is a panini with chicken, avocado, brie cheese, mustard, hummus, tomato and spinach.  While the prices may seem just a bit high for some items, it is VERY worth it.  For my sandwich, the amount of brie cheese they use alone would cost the amount of the sandwich.  It is delicious and I am craving one as I type.

There are quite a few restaurants in Ste Anne's I would recommend however this one is perfect for a snowy day inside or a refreshing summer day.  I would go to TWIGS every day if I could."}
{"text":"TWIGS is a classic Ste. Anne's fixture on Lakeshore, right by the water. The set up and decor is cute and welcoming with homemade everything as you would expect from a local cafe. 

I've tried a couple sandwiches but my favourite by far is the TJ (Turkey and bacon) on their homemade white bread. Their iced coffee was only OK. 

Tip: If you are in a hurry, you can call ahead and your order will be ready when you arrive! It's a small establishment so you never know how long you'll have to wait if it's busy. Trust me, it's worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"Dans Beaconsfield, il y a ce petit coin agréable avec plusieurs commerces et un Café. Un très bon Café. C'est vraiment le meilleur Café du West Island à mon avis.  Il y a des sandwichs avec des options vegan et le service est amicale et les skills des barristas aussi.

Très bon spot."}
