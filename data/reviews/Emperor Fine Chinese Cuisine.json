{"text":"Monday night special - Peking duck for $20. 

Mondays are basically the only time I come to this restaurant. No, the Peking duck is not the best in the city. The pancakes are very floury for some reason, the duck is smaller than most and the meat can be dry at times. But really, it's $20. You can't ask for much more. Note, you have to order another dish along with the Peking duck. 

The service is great. Decor is outdated. Also there's little to no reception inside the restaurant. Maybe it's to remind you to use your hands to eat Peking duck instead of checking social media on your phone..."}
{"text":"Came here recently for a dinner course meal.

The dishes weren't exciting and the flavour was bland. The dish size was on the smaller side. 

We would probably not visit this place again for dinner."}
{"text":"Service is good but I've been here a couple of times and the food still hasn't changed much; it isn't that great."}
{"text":"My regular spot for dimsum. 
For me, dimsum here tastes better than golden court or other dimsum place near here.

Hargou and Siumai is my all time favorite and spare rib with black bean sauce is yummy too. Everything is average or above average. Don't forget to have warm egg tart for your dessert. 

Service is good, but they don't speak English well. I don't mind."}
{"text":"This restaurant offers flat rate and has no time restriction on all the small, medium and large Dim Sum for under $3.  This is by far the best offer amongst all the Dim Sum restaurants that I know.  Usually the special rate in other restaurants will only be before 11:00 a.m. or after 2:30 p.m.

The quality of the Dim Sum is good.  It is actually better than  Regal Palace on Yonge that I reviewed earlier which is the same chain restaurant.  On Sunday, it offers Dim Sum that are dated back in the 70s and 80s.  These Dim Sum are not available any other week days.  They are not on the list that you can tick but is personally delivered by waitress walking around with these dishes.  Those that I recall are Thousand years old egg with fresh ginger pie, papaya custard pie, mango glutinous rice with coconut shreds.  They are yummy!  On the edge of the walkway has some bigger Dim Sum dishes that they offer like the Braised Pork and Egg with Ginger and Vinegar.

The Manager there introduces us to the dinner special every day that includes lobster, Peking duck for $1 (or a few dollars) or abalone that varies in price and one special for each night.

I like the special Dim Sum offer that has no time restriction.  I will come back again"}
{"text":"Dim sum is 2/5 and dinner is 4/5

I went recently on a Sunday around noon.  They have a dim sum special where all S, M, L items are less than $3 which is great (and it doesn't need to be before 11am). However, the food quality suffered and the food came out lukewarm. We ordered over $200 worth of food and there wasn't anything that stood out. Because they were busy, the servers often forgot our requests. The restaurant charged us for dishes that never came, and it took us asking a few servers before the issue was fixed.

I've been here a couple of times for dinner. On weeknights, they often have daily specials including Peking Duck for only $19.99 (I believe it's a Monday special).

I also had my family celebration here and booked 7 tables in the private room. The restaurants lights were off at 530pm although the sign at the front said they were opened. The owner said that the waiters come back on their shift at 6pm. Note: It's best to eat dinner after 6pm there.

We ordered the special King Crab dinner set menu and added a few extra dishes. They showed us the crab before cooking it which was cool.  The food came out at a great pace, nicely presented, hot and the dishes were all flavourful. The servers were attentive and got everything that my guest and I requested. They were accommodating and allowed us to bring our own music. 

My husband and I were happy we chose this restaurant for the celebration. If their dim sum food and service could match what we experienced for dinner, they would do much better."}
{"text":"Came here for a wedding and their menu was decent. While the food was not outstanding, it was good and satisfying. Each dish was well portioned for the table and the service was prompt and efficient. 

I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here but I wouldn't be opposed to going here if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here for dinner for 1 year and was in the area to give it another try.  Their wednesday night BBQ pork deal for $6 was terrible, dry and lacking flavour.  Free soup was too watery.  The beef filet in sweet sauce had some overly thick pieces that were as tough as leather.  Shrimps stir fried w/ cashews and celery was the only decent dish, but was a bit too light on the salt.  Pea shoots stir fried also lacked any flavour or wok hay.  Dessert was the only passable dish of the night.  Service was slow, even though only about 1/2 the restaurant was full by 8pm.  The waiters were mostly focussed on either the larger tables or regular patrons that they knew by their last names, and we were mostly ignored.  A real let down, most likely my last time here."}
{"text":"This is a review of dinner service my family had on Boxing Day. This place is pretty much your average Chinese restaurant in Richmond Hill, their group specials however are a bit cheaper than most other restaurants so that should have been a warning sign. 
For our group of 12 we had a 10 course meal which included Peking duck with the lettuce wrap and lobster. 
The first couple of courses went fine and were tasty however midway is when things went downhill. Usually in a 10 course dinner you don't have a lot of downtime between dishes but during our whole dinner we had periods where we were left wondering where the next plate was. They also apparently forgot about our lobster so it arrived later on in the meal and not fresh. Our lettuce wraps only consisted of 10 pieces of lettuce and the amount of filling left me wondering what they did with the rest of the duck, it didn't matter anyways since there wasn't enough to go around the table. 
To top it off for dessert they told us they burned the red bean soup so they didn't have any at the end. 
You have to love a place where it's not even a packed restaurant and they manage to give you below average meal and then are forced to pay gratuity because it's already included. 
Overall I say this place is hit or miss, that day was a huge miss so diners roll the dice at your own peril."}
{"text":"Average for mediocre dim sum. They do have specials tho. On a Sunday afternoon around 1:30 everything was charged as a small which was nice so we got to order a lot of large dishes for the price of small. 
They did change their pineapple pork buns portions tho which is my fav thing here. A year ago they used to serve it in 4 buns now they only have 3. Disappointed since I usually dim sum with my family of 4. 
Will come back tho. Convenient location. Lots of parking."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday around 9:30am for dim sum. I like going to dim sum early because of the Early Bird specials / usually there's a long line if you go around 10-11am. But at Emperor, there was no reason to come early. 9:30am and the restaurant was empty except for a few tables. 10:30am and the restaurant was around 1/3-1/2 full...

Service was good, very attentive (probably because there weren't that many people yet)

Food quality was pretty average.. nothing really stood out.
Price was decent- $3 for S,M,L dishes
Sticky rice in lotus leaf was not good. Neither was the xiao long bao (they came to our table cold). I do not recommend.

What's good about Emperor is that they put their menu up on their website for you to check out before going!"}
{"text":"This is my regular dim sum place.  They recently got a new owner and renovated a little.  They are current having a promo for dim sum S/M/L all cost $2.70.  They also changed the menu a bit but all the basic dim sum items are still there. 

The food quality is always good when you go and the service is fast and attentive."}
{"text":"Great Place for dimsum and the Daily specials can be a great value. I have tried the Peking Duck for 20$!!!! on Mondays and Crab Claw special for Friday's at 2.88$!!! I have yet to try out the lobster special on Sunday's. I like dim sum here which is somewhat medium priced.
Recommended."}
{"text":"At first I noticed all the positive reviews for this place and I thought; is there something wrong with me since I had such a horrible experience? Then I realized that most of the great reviews are from 2012 and older, so clearly this restaurant has went downhill significantly. First issue, apparently there was a renovation and there is this annexed area to the side. So the restaurant decides to shaft everyone into the annexed area, even though there were plenty of empty seats in the main dining space. Normally that should be ok, BUT the annexed area lacked the normal comfy seats and instead we sat on fold up chairs. Not even the comfy cushy kind, but the hard and plastic kind! Fine. Maybe the food would compensate for my lack of comfort. Nope. To be honest the food isn't bad, but neither was it very good. There are certainly better alternative dim sum places at the same price or lower. What really pushed me over the edge was the service, which deserves a whole paragraph to itself. 

So, we were waiting for two more members to join our table so there were two vacant seats. The manager, without even asking us whether the chairs are needed just whisks in and takes it. My uncle had to tell him to put it back, and he failed to apologize for this behavior. Then my uncle asked the manager for another dim sum sheet, to which he got no reply and the manager just walked off. Sure he did return with one, but as a paying customer, I feel that we deserve to be acknowledged when we're speaking to you, so we know that you actually heard us in the loud atmosphere. That's not too much to ask is it? And I guess the manager have set an example for the rest of the staff, because they did the same thing. Ignore us, then bring what we asked for. Sure it's nice that they listened to our request but I think it's simply respectful to say \"sure ,ok\" or even just nod, if speaking is so very difficult.

Overall, my experience here was so bad that I can't fathom returning here. Maybe if they got new waitstaff and funding for chairs."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum on Sat. I would recommend either coming just before lunch time or after the lunch rush. We got there around 11:45am and had to wait about 10 min for a table. It was crazy as soon as the noon hour hit, lots of people waiting for tables. 

The food was decently priced paid about $16 per person for about 10 dishes. We were so full and even had to take leftovers home. The service was fast and efficient. It one of those places were you order dim sum on paper.

I was pleasantly surprised that the dim sum here tasted good. We ordered pigs feet in the ginger and sweetened vinegar sauce and this was the best one that's I've tried from any dim sum place. The pigs feet was tender and the egg wasn't rubbery. The balance of the sweet and sour of the sauce was spot on and delicious. We liked it so much were ordered another dish of it. 

Other highlights of the meal were: the cheong fun (rice noodle roll) with shrimp. Only complaint was that it was cold, but it still tasted good. We ordered har gow (shrimp dumplings), really enjoyed the turnip cake as well. We also got this pastry dumplings with BBQ pork, which was also good the pastry was nice and flaky and the filling good ratio.

Overall enjoyed the food here and would come again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today for my famjam of 15 people so we tried out quite an assortment of dishes.

Overall, the food was slightly below average and the service was downright poor! 
Several of the dishes needed improvement. The \"bean curd roll\" was too mushy, the stirfry vermicelli was too bland, and the baked buns were only lukewarm. 
As for service, they only give you ONE ordering sheet and when we asked for a second one to add orders, we were told to just write on the old, cluttered one and make it more noticeable... It's just an extra sheet of paper for goodness sake! As well, we had a lot of finished dishes that kept pilling up and no one came to take them away. At one point, I asked the waiter to take it and he said it wasn't his job and I had to ask another fella. ?!? If you can't take them for god knows what reason, the least you could do is help me flag for one of the waiters that can...

Not very satisfied with my experience here, will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went here for dim sum on a Sunday. 

Food:
Decent dim sum. You order off a form (no carts). S, M, and L dishes all $2.99 between 9am-4pm. That's a pretty good deal. Most of the traditional/popular dim sum dishes were S-M-L. 
For $2.99, don't expect quality like Dragon Boat Fusion. It's comparable to Tremendous in Mississauga. 
They had some combo specials that was also pretty cheap. We got one lobster (likely under 1lb) + one plate of bok choi + e fu noodles for $23, which I thought was a pretty good deal. Enough food to make a meal for two (Noodles dish was a good portion). 

Wait time:

I think if you get here before 11:30am you won't wait long for a table. We waited about 10 minutes for a table for 4. By 12:30pm we noticed the line up was longer. 

Ambiance:
Traditional Chinese restaurant with a red and gold head table backdrop (used for special events / weddings). Pretty large restaurant with two main sections. 

Service:
I felt like the hostess let 1-2 tables after us go first because they were regulars or because they spoke Chinese so I didn't like that. Otherwise, food came pretty quick and the manager (round man wearing a suit) that serviced my table was good."}
{"text":"Back in the olden days, Chinese emperors had eunuchs test out their food for poisoning before every meal.  I'll leave the food poisoning up to the eunuchs and just come to sample some of the food that Emperor has to offer.

As with most restaurants in the \"Rich\"-mond Hill area, the ambiance at Emperor is a little nicer, the service is a little better - but what about the food?

My uncle has seemed to embrace a new found love with Emperor, and we've dined here a few times.  The service here is better than your average Chinese restaurant, but that is also reflected in the price of your meal.  There are wet towels at your disposal to clean your hands prior to eating, and they do change your dishes once throughout the evening.  Your first tea serving is also poured for you, but after that you'll need to search for a eunuch if you don't want to lift a finger?

The food here is pretty average.  The portion sizes however, are smaller than most.  We ordered a set dinner and a few extras.

The Seafood and Tofu Soup was pretty mediocre.  It was a very thick soup that was a tad on the salty side. 

The most memorable dish for me was the Peking Duck (which we got 2 ways, e.g. also with the Lettuce Wraps).  The skin was nice and crisp, and there was a healthy ratio of fat to meat.  The pancakes were also quite fresh.  However, in the second course with the lettuce wraps the duck was oily, oily, oily! 

The Crab Claws (e.g. deep-fried crab) were quite good as well.  The batter was not too oily and the crab meat was quite tender.  However, I was missing the usual red vinegar that I love to plunge my crab claws into.  Instead, it was substituted here with some sort of sweet and spicy chili sauce which was actually a nice departure from my usual.  

The Yeung Chow Fried Rice (made with barbecued pork and shrimp) for me was a little bland, and they put in full shrimps.  I think a diced shrimp would incorporate better with the other small, diced ingredients of the dish.  The shrimps stuck out like a sore thumb. 

For dessert, in addition to the usual Red Bean Soup, you will also get a plate of heart-shaped mango jello and almond cookies.  My word of advice?  Avoid the red bean soup and go for the jello and almond cookies.  The red bean soup was bland and watery.

Verdict:

This is a place that your would-be husband would take your parents to to ask for your hand in marriage; or a place you'd take your in-laws to for a nice dinner.  In essence, if you want good Chinese food you can probably find better elsewhere if you're not looking to impress the invited party.  

You may also want to call in advance to make sure there isn't a planned function with the usual karaoke set-up.  We were unfortunate and ended up dining here on the same night of a private function; and to perpetuate stereotypes there was a karaoke machine present.  We cringed every 5 minutes when a new singer came on.  Some may find opera offensive, but compared to some of the stuff I heard here tonight (e.g. a woman's mourning sobs for the loss of her child, or a terrorized cat) I'll take Puccini any day!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a solid 1 star. We came here tonight for Mother's Day and ordered the combo the $168, it comes with green onion and ginger lobster (I have mistaken this as a larger cray fish) moving on to the steamed fish, it has a soil taste and feels like after a whole day of fishing. The chicken, my mom said it was too salty. Every dish was very mediocre, I don't think I will come back again .. quite a disappointing experience.

At the entrance, it indicated, method of payment can be credit card. The combo, when we asked for the bill, I gave them my credit card, they said we don't accept that, then I asked if I can pay for my bank card. Again the response was \"no\" for a meal over $200 who would carry that much cash on them all the time?!? They built in tips into it while they don't let you pay with credit card. Luckily there was a TD in the plaza, so I went to get cash. It is extremely inconvenient to a customer and they should have specified at the beginning that combo cash only.

Anyways, ruined my day with this dining experience!"}
{"text":"Came here for a big family feast and then dim sum two days later. Their location is such that most locals would only know about it and isn't as busy as some of the other hot restaurants.  Perfect place to get a good meal without a ridiculous wait."}
{"text":"We went for family gathering and each dish was being really salty. I need to drink a lots of tea to get rid of the salty taste out of my moth. THE BBQ pork was way to fat between the skin and the meat. 

The restaurant does not really have any fancy
decorations. The overall looking is like back to 50 years ago."}
{"text":"\"Wow. Just wow.\" 
I used to really liked this restaurant, and it really went \"downhill\" now.

The food was just terrible,
the dish served was poorly served."}
{"text":"Rating: 2.5

Decent place for some dim sum. The food is meh. Nothing too special. I wished they had more options to choose from. A lot of the food I wanted to eat weren't in the menu (some of the more common staple ones). Some of the food was a bit too bland for my taste. The Shrimp Dumplings I ordered were pretty damn good though ngl, but it wasn't good enough for me to come back for them. Servers were pretty nice and I do like how dim sum of any size is $2.98."}
{"text":"The dim sum here is average at best. Nothing to write home about. The only reason I'd go here is that it's within walking distance from our house and I'm too lazy to drive. But that won't happen because we are foodies. 

I've also been here for Chinese wedding banquets and I imagine it was selected as a more economical option. 

Sadly I'm at a loss for words for how to describe what average tasting dim sum is.  Some examples would be the skin on the Har Gow (shrimp dumpling) is too chewy and thick.  The Fong Zao (chicken feet) lacks flavour. 

Normally good dim sum restaurants also spice up the popular dishes with their own twists and they make things fancier.  You won't find that here."}
{"text":"Too bad we cannot give this place zero stars.  If you are thinking about making a reservation here to celebrate a special occasion, think twice because Chinese Emperor Fine Cuisine lacks any integrity.  They will gladly bump your reservation to please other guests that have a larger number in their party.  We did not appreciate being lied to and being rushed out the door.

We booked this restaurant on a referral as it was about 10 minutes from the Elgin Mills Cemetery.  We dealt with the manager, Charlie and made a reservation for 4 tables at 4pm on Saturday, Feb. 24th.  This reservation was for the traditional Chinese meal following my mom's funeral, called the jie hui jiu ???/???.  Charlie told my wife and I, that he would give us the private room (which he showed us) at no additional charge.  We agreed to call the restaurant at 2pm to confirm the actual number of tables so they could ensure enough food was prepared for our guests. That is, only charge us for the actual number of tables so no extra food is prepared and wasted.

When I arrived at the restaurant, I was unpleasantly surprised to find my relatives and friends seated at the very back of the restaurant just inside the front doors.  The lady at the front claimed someone from our party called to say we were going to arrive at 3:30pm and nobody arrived until 4pm.  Because of that they gave away the private room to another party. This was an outright lie.  My friend who was helping us called the restaurant at 2pm confirmed we needed 3 tables and possibly a fourth.  
After confronting Charlie, he said our reservation was for 3:30pm.  I was furious and called him out for lying.  Our agreement was 4pm, so how the hell could he do something like that given he knew this was a special meal following my mom's funeral?!  Only then did he admit the party that had booked the main dining room requested 6 additional tables at the last minute.

So rather than say no, they bumped us out of the private room and gave it to another party that had the main dining room booked. In other words, since our reservation was for only a couple of tables, we got bumped.

If that was not bad enough, I noticed the dishes seemed to come at a much quicker pace than normal.  Overall the food was just okay but the steamed chicken terrible.  They must order chickens on diets because there was barely any meat on any of the pieces (hardly anyone at all of our tables ate any of this dish).  By 5:30pm the wait staff seemed to also hover around and was in a hurry to clear our tables as though they wanted us to leave irrespective of the fact that my family and guests were trying to enjoy each other's company.  

Charlie tried to apologize and tried to make amends by offering a 10% discount when we were settling the bill.  That does not even remotely make up for what they did.  Karma will give this restaurant what it deserves."}
{"text":"Came here for a multi-course dinner for a large family gathering. I have to say that some of the dishes were a hit, and some of the dishes were a complete miss. Overall, I didn't mind the restaurant, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.
The restaurant is very, very big. There was a wedding going on on one side, and our event on the other. There is fish tanks, which I am never a fan of. No one wants to see animals in fish tanks while eating what came out of those fish tanks. No one wants to eat a steak while staring at a cow...
Dishes I liked included lobster (surprisingly, it was really good), shrimp balls, desert. 
What I didn't like? seafood soup, pork, chicken, vegetables.
Washroom was big. 

Service was good. Always was around, and kept the tea hot."}
{"text":"We always drive past this mall, and never gave it a second thought until we saw the sign hanging in front of Emperor for the $2.98 everyday dim sum special. 

This special is only valid if paid in cash, but it's an all day special which allows for a lot more flexibility in meet ups. We all want that early bird special, but we also always have that one person in our group that just can't get up in time (I'm guilty of that at times)

The food came out quite quickly. Overall the food didn't really wow me, but also was not bad. It's definitely a very solid \"good\" dim sum place for what your paying and getting. I would say a solid 3.5 stars. Its not as glamorous as other places, but also doesn't hurt the wallet.

It has the usual selection of dim sum fare, and did everything well enough that i could find little to no fault. 

The service was surprisingly good for a dim sum place. The waiters and the people handling the orders were quite synced up and friendly. 

I wouldn't hesitate to come back if i had a hankering for some good dim sum, but if your looking to impress some older asian parents you may want to look elsewhere, but also spend more too."}
{"text":"My family and I used to be regulars around here. During our last visit, we ordered a set meal. The food that were given to us was barely enough to feed our family of five, even though the menu stated that it was for six. Also, we ordered 3lb of lobster and we mainly got shells with very little meat. When we complained to the waitresses, we were only given dirty looks and quiet murmurs amongst the waitresses instead of fixing the issue. 

In addition, they were so secretive about their wifi password that only one waitress in the entire restaurant knew it and she insisted on entering it into each phone at our table instead of just saying it out loud so we can all type it in, making the process a lot more efficient. 

The last straw was when they charged us for tips AFTER tax. This is illegal because tips should always be given before tax, unless their service was outstanding. This will be the last time that my family and I visit this restaurant, don't waste your money here!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 2 star now after having dim sum this past weekend. It was quite disappointing. The prices have slightly increased and the food quality has decreased. Some of the dishes were quite bland, even the fried taro dumpling with pork! The service wasn't as quick as before and the atmosphere wasn't very pleasant. Although this couldn't have been controlled by the restaurant, but when we went, customers around us were either coughin without covering their mouths or blowing their noses. I think I have to find a new place for dim sum now!"}
{"text":"Dim sum is awesome here. Can't go wrong with your order but is a little expensive."}
{"text":"This is my family's favourite dim sum restaurant because it is within walking distance from our house. For those who drive, there's ample parking in the plaza. Restaurant is large enough to ensure that you don't have to wait long to get a seat. The price is very reasonable for dim sum in the Richmond Hill area and best of all, the price is the same whether in the morning, during lunch or in the afternoon. Just make sure that you're ready to pay your bill by cash"}
{"text":"Chinese Restaurant, Gotta get Peaking duck. Service is alright, food does not excel, but it's not bad. Atmosphere is pretty good, looks nice. But if you aren't accustomed to loud noises, it's gets pretty loud here."}
{"text":"The dimsum all tastes great and the setting is very pretty! 

The only thing is that it's on the pricy side of dimsum, at 2.68 for S,M,L dishes and 5.90 for XL and 6.90 for Specials. But the food isn't thaaaat high quality enough to cost so much more than other dim sums.

However, the service is really good and friendly, there's constantly people walking around removing empty dishes, refilling teapots and giving you new plates. So that was great. It was nice to come here for a nicer gathering"}
{"text":"My review is only based on the dim sum special experience.

Good - All day dim sum special (9 AM - 4PM, $2.98 S, M, L size dim sum), spacious, good, prompt and polite service. The restaurant locates in a plaza with plenty of parking.

Average - dim sum is decent, but not the best ones I had. Freshness is okay; the hargow skin got a little \"hard\" at the end of the meal. Size of dim sum is bite size; you can say it is authentic. ^_^  Choices of dim sum is okay - lava egg yoke bun is unavailable; deep fried squid is XL :(

Consider it is $2.98 per dish, it is okay in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 3/5
This place is located near Bayview Ave and 16th Ave. in the plaza with TD Canada Trust. There weren't that many cool places to explore in the area. 

[SERVICE] - 4/5
We came here on a regular Sunday & the servers were friendly and our order arrived quickly. Hopefully, the service won't be too slow on Father's Day. 

[DÉCOR] - 4/5 
I love the tablecloth and comfy red chairs. The place is actually kept very well for a restaurant that's been around since 2011.  

[QUALITY] - 3/5
Quality was good, nothing fancy, but a solid choice for standard dim sum dishes.

[ORDER] - 4/5
- Dim Sum Special S/M/L - $3.08 Mon-Sun (except public holidays): definitely worth the price if you crave classic dim sum items like har gow, siu mai, sticky rice in lotus leaf, rice noodle rolls, etc.  

[OVERALL] - 4/5
I would recommend this place for a classic dim sum experience at Emperor's Fine Chinese Cuisine because their solid dim sum was worth the value!"}
{"text":"I happened to pass by this small business strip mall.  Since I didn't have anything to eat and it was perfect timing for Dim Sum, I decided to drop in on a whim.

What a wonderful surprise to find a dim sum house / restaurant in this otherwise secluded area.

The opulant decor is what I grew up with in the Chinatown of Montreal.  Like a faux fancy palace with waiters in their pretend fancy waiter outfits.  You know the kind that converts from dim sum, to dinner, to banquet in a flash?

Well the food was excellent as I ordered a few dim sum standards (har gow, siu mei, and sticky rice in lotus leaf) to test out and I was not disappointed.

Will definately come here again albeit a little off the beaten path, next time with friends."}
{"text":"I primarily come here for the dim sum, been to one wedding banquet. 
They still charge $2.68 for s/m/l dim sum all day and weekends except holidays, but they have recently changed their menu...and alot that disappoints me. They still have the staples such as har gow which is plump full of shrimp but the wrapper is pretty weak, but they've taken out some good dishes and added in special order ones, that cost $5-8.
but it's still the cheapest one in town!"}
{"text":"Went there for some dim sum and was impressed with the food!  My friend and I went and got 5 different dishes and the total came out to $20, everything was good (probably the best dim sum i've had in recent years, but i'm not a dim sum pro). Unlike the other reviewers they had no problem sitting me in the normal area with the comfy chairs and nice tablecloths. 

Service was about average (kind of slow bringing the dishes, but all dim sum i've been to has been relatively slow).  I arrived first and without asking what type of tea i wanted, they just brought some. My friend arrived and asked me which tea i picked, and i responded with whatever they gave me.  She then asks our waiter which tea it is, who responded (in Chinese) with \"it's Jasmine tea, white people like it\"."}
{"text":"Just came back from trying their Dim Sum on a Wed.  This is very good quality Dim Sum at reasonable prices.  Flavor and style, very old school Cantonese, fresh/light and non greasy, easy on stomach.  My favs were their common dishes:  Siu Mai and Har Gow were generous portions and very tasty.  Rich noodle wrap (Cheung Fun) was a little on the thick side.  Roast Pork Pastry, very light and non greasy, just the way I prefer it.  The Dim Sum here reminds me of Sun Sui Wah in Vancouver but at a better pricing and larger portions.  Again, this is a place for the food, not for the decor or first date."}
{"text":"I've been here so often with the family, it's ridiculous. 

Dimsum is Average with a capital A. The standouts would be a bitter melon dish with the salty egg crumbled on top, but that's a special price. I order the usual spare ribs in black bean sauce, har gow. Average average.

The decor is very dated, with ceiling lights looking very 90s. The ceiling is also very low, so it's not pleasant sitting here. Worse than that, my phone never has reception in the inner half of the restaurant! GASP, I know, but in this day and age, it's ridiculous to me!

The family has since chosen other locations to satisfy our weekly dimsum needs, so I don't expect to be back here."}
{"text":"I had read that the Chinese food in Toronto is legendary, and since high-quality Chinese food in Chicago is so lacking, I made it a priority to find a top-class Chinese restaurant even if it meant having to drive out to the suburbs.  I settled on Emperor after reading some fine reviews, but I was a little concerned about not having a reservation (when we were dining in Vancouver, we were turned down by two or three restaurants because we didn't have reservations!).  We got there at six and the place was pretty much empty and we were seated promptly.  In the end, we decided to order a lobster yi-mian, sauteed beef cubes with snap peas in a bird's nest, and braised tofu with mushrooms and shrimp roe.  We were originally thinking about getting a lobster, but the price seemed to be a bit too high ($22/lb for a normal lobster), so we went with the lobster yi-mian instead.  And man was it the right choice.  The noodles were not too soggy nor too dry, so it was the perfect texture.  And the lobster of course was very flavorful.  The sauteed beef was incredibly tender, and my mom declared it to be the most delicious beef she has had in a Chinese establishment.  The tofu was also very delicious though ultimately I thought it wasn't anything extraordinary.

Now while we were eating, there was this old couple sitting next to us who kept looking over at us.  Eventually, the wife had to speak up and asked us if we were from around here.  We said no, and she asked if we were aware of today's special.  We had seen the roasted pork special for only $1 on the menu but we thought you had to order the dinner sets to get the deal.  The old woman told us that there is a daily special and that today it was the roast pork and immediately flagged down a waiter and had him add an order of the roast pork to our table.  Such an incredibly nice woman!  The skin of the roast pork was very crispy (just the way I like it) while the meat was very juicy and tender.  We thanked the couple endlessly for their recommendation.

Now I'm not used to Chinese restaurants providing elaborate desserts.  Maybe a bowl of red bean soup or saigo, but nothing on the level that Emperor gave us.  Dessert consisted of a bowl of soup that had a lot of stuff in it (taro, red bean, rice, etc), a coconut bar, and some sort of cookie/pastry.  Way beyond our expectations.  We felt like we were missing out on this quality of food and service - even back in California!

Now the only reason why I'm taking off one star is how they handled payment.  I was intending to use my credit card (which is how we tend to pay for food in the US!) but when the bill came they already incorporated a 10% discount if you used cash.  Unfortunately, we did not have enough cash, but we didn't think it would be a big issue for them to swipe my card.  But the first server said that because we had ordered the roast pig special, we had to pay in cash.  We said we didn't have enough Canadian dollars and eventually the manager came to us and made a deal.  He would have to remove the 10% discount and add another 3% as an administrative fee for using a credit card.  We agreed in the end, but I thought it was a bit inconvenient to always pay in cash, especially at a place like Emperor where dinner for a big group can probably grow to around $200 easily.  So for American visitors eating in the Richmond Hill/Markham areas, remember to bring plenty of cash for your meals!"}
{"text":"I been to Emperor Fine Chinese Cuisine a couple of time for their dim sum special, for $2.70 includes S/M/L sizes are quite reasonable, The quality is decent and the ingredients are fresh. Highly recommended if you can make a trip at their special time!

For dinner they also have a different special everyday! We ended up going on a Sunday which they have double lobster for $16.88 which is not even advertised on their website. We ended up ordering:

Peking Duck 2 Ways ($39.88)
- The skin so crispy and the freshly made crepes wrapping has this great chewy bite which I enjoy!
- The 2nd course has all the duck meat chopped up in small cubes and stir fried with carrots and celery has this great smokey taste. And the lettuce fresh and handpicked to have this round shape, great attention to details in the kitchen!

Double Lobster Special ($16.88)
- I secretly ate most of it, aside from the head .. yes it is that good!
- luckily the waiter came and change all our dishes mid meal if not my shell would be stacking sky high!

King Mushroom with Baby Snow pea Leaf ($18.88)
- Healthy option with just a touch of salt... great to balance out other dishes

Beef with Mushroom ($18.88)
- The dish I enjoy the least this evening, but my table mate seems to love the savoury taste and the chunk of meat! So still great choice!

Complimentary Dessert: Red Bean Soup with Sesame Pastry and Coconut pudding. And if you really don't enjoy Red Bean Soup (yes soup for dessert?!!), if you ask nicely you might get  Mango Pudding moulded into 2 fishes arranged into Classic Taoist taijitu of 'fish-like' shape 

Personally I like them both? Can I just have both?!

Services here can be hit and miss. Some staffs are really friendly, some staffs may try to force the more expensive \"specials\" on you and get annoyed if tell them no.... 

I would definitely be back for more dim sum and other daily dinner specials... and order what I enjoy and not what I being hard sell to.

Make sure to print out the 10% off dinner coupon on their website and in order to take advantages of discount and special, bring some cool hard cash!"}
{"text":"Future couples: DO NOT HAVE YOUR WEDDING HERE!!!! We made the mistake of trusting the greedy restaurant manager. Every time we went to see the manager, he was super friendly..maybe TOO friendly.. we did not realize that he was just being fake and then, he showed his true face on our wedding night. Charlie Lin ruined the end of our wedding night because he wanted 12% tips on top of what we needed to pay him. During our consultations and meet ups with Charlie leading up to wedding day, at no point was 12% tips ever discussed or agreed upon. Be careful of this two headed snake. THE RESTAURANT DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH TIP IS GIVEN, IT IS UP TO THE CUSTOMER TO DECIDE WHAT IS DESERVED.

Before reception, our wedding planner had to remind them to change the table cloths because they were the wrong colour. This resulted in delayed preparations. My mother-in-law waited a long time for orange juice during dinner. She ended up having to get up and go get it herself. We also had a vendors table that was going to be served different dishes outside of the main course reserved for guests. Instead of consulting us first on what to order for the vendors table, they ordered 5 expensive dishes on our behalf just to make more money.

Because we disagreed with Charlie's selfish request for 12% tips, we ended up having a one hour conversation with him. My father-in-law and wedding planner also got involved. We were all very polite and professional until at one point he got frustrated and told my father-in-law and wedding planner to \"shut the f*** up\" because he only wanted to discuss with my husband and I. Who does that on someone's wedding night??!! CHARLIE WAS EXTREMELY RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL. A WOLF HIDING IN SHEEP SKIN. ABSOLUTELY NO INTEGRITY. HE IS A DISGRACE TO SOCIETY AND THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY.

After our time wasted discussion with Charlie, he continued to angrily order his staff to shut down the dance floor early and to start cleaning up. This also left our MC and DJ confused and forced them to start packing up early. My husband and I missed our dance party and did not have a chance to say goodbye to our guests that night. The days after our wedding, we had people asking us why we disappeared for so long because they wanted to wish us a good night before leaving. I was upset for two days after. 

We learned the hard way, but we truly believe that every action has a consequence. Bad karma and misfortune will flow through his business.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT FOR ANY SPECIAL OCCASIONS OR EVENTS. THEIR MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO GAIN AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT REGARD FOR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND SATISFACTION."}
{"text":"This is a review for the dim sum lunch only.

Emperor Fine's dim sum is generally solid.  The quality of the individual dishes ranges from good to mediocre. 

BEST:

****^Fried white radish cake (or \"turnip patties\") is flavourful with ample white radish chunks. It's fried up well with crispy edges.

****Deep fried taro & pork dumpling is tasty with the right amount of soft mashed taro. Good crispy texture.

***^Braised chicken feet are quite soft & tender. Flavours are absorbed well into the chicken skin.

***^Bean curd roll tastes pretty good, but isn't well constructed. They were falling apart.  They're accompanied by a flavourful sauce. 

OKAY:

***Rice bowl with spare ribs & chicken foot is mixed. Ribs (5 pieces) were flavourful & cooked the right amount.  Braised chicken foot (1 piece) was undercooked. Rice was normal. This is a pretty good dim sum to get if everyone needs a bit of rice & complex carbs to feel full.

***Steamed shrimp dumpling (har gow) is not bad but not great. On the plus side, the dumpling was stuffed with ample chunks of shrimp and tastes good. However, the dumpling skin was too thick and chewy, not delicate as it's supposed to be.

**^Rice roll with tofu is just okay.  

NOT SO GOOD:
*^Shanghai dumpling (xiao long bao) is not very good. These dumplings did not come to our table hot. They should be served hot with juices trapped inside the dumpling. These dumplings were not juicy. The filling was solid and dense instead of tender and juicy. Dumpling skin was chewy.

^Rice roll with fried dough stick is not good.  Dough stick was undercooked and doughy instead of being crispy. This is rather pointless since the whole point of having this dish & putting a dough stick inside the rice roll is to get the crispy texture to contrast with the soft texture of the rice roll. No flavour. I'd avoid this one.

^Taro cake is not good. Tastes like taro, but it was comprised of dry pieces of latticed taro. I'd avoid.

SUMMARY:
Food is not bad in general, and pretty good for the price. Each Small, Medium and Large dish is $2.68. Cash only for dim sum lunch. Cover charge was $1.20 per person.

PS. I used ^ to indicate a half-star and * for a full star. So, ***^ means 3.5 stars."}
