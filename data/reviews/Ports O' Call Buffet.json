{"text":"Breakfast buffet is so-so. Nothing really tasty, they only have Mexican menudo for soup which was bland. I tried the pastries, they were dry. I thought they tasted old. The only things I enjoyed was the corned beef on which I poured gravy for better taste and the orange juice. Not a lot of selection. Service was good, staff was nice and friendly. Place is clean. Would not come back though."}
{"text":"Well I wasn't expecting anything crazy good. I'd say everything I tried was all decent from Mongolia grill to a very flavorful  prime rib. Desserts carrot cake 7 coconut pie 7 out of 10. Price great $15 Today's buffets in Vegas  are all over priced and half of there food is below average. I'd rather spend $100 at Vic and Anthonys For a great meal then Any Buffet in town."}
{"text":"Husband and I were at Gold Coast buffet last night (Sunday-01/18/16) for dinner (5:30 pm).  I need say that I do not particularly like this buffet to start with, but things can always change.  I now shall start at the beginning.  1.  Price is OUTRAGEOUS for what is served.  2.  More service people than people to service. Ordered our drinks & proceeded to check the line.  3.  Checked out what was being served from the salad to the Italian dishes. Same old stuff last night or 6 months ago.  4.  Female server brings our drinks, and two steak knives, 1 was dirty, husband asks for more napkins, she never returns. Someone else comes to the table takes her name tag and replaces with his, and walks away.  (She went on break but never told us.)  5.  Proceeded to get our food.  I had chicken breast w/spinach, olives, mushrooms and cheese; green beans; and, stuffed manicotti.  Sat down to take a look...tried the chicken breast but could not cut it. The topping was so hard it would not cut - removed spinach stuff and ate the chicken (mostly).  Green beans were fine!  Moved onto the manicotti, which was COLD in the middle!  Not such a big deal ate one bite and gave it up.  Awful tasting.  6.  Go to the soup bar-cream of potato soup!  GREAT - a favorite of ours. Filled two bowls and went to get soup spoons. I must have gone through 12-15 spoons all of which had sticky handles or food stuck to them.  Went to other side and pick spoons. Proceeded to eat the soup - it was barely warm soup, potatoes were cold.     7.  While seated and talking with my husband, our server comes toward us and it certainly looked like it had his finger up his nose and then proceeds to wipe his nose down his arm. I thought I was going to lose the little bit of food that I just ate.   8.  Husband drinks some coffee and goes back to buffet - I stayed at the table and notice something red on the side of his coffee cup.  My first thoughts were OMG - lipstick - than said nah.  My first thoughts were correct.  LIPSTICK AND LIP IMPRESSION ON OUTSIDE AND INSIDE OF CUP.  Husband back at the table now and I tell him what I found while he was gone.  Must note: he is left handed so the lipstick was on the opposite side of the cup, but still disgusting no matter what, and I don't wear lipstick.  9. I asked the hostess to please call the manager.  She proceeded to ask why I wanted to speak to him. So she says she will call him.  I waited, and waited, and waited....She comes back after 10+ minutes and tells us that he has to come from the other side of the building so it will take him a little time to get to us.  All total - probably waited 15 minutes.  10.  He finally gets to the table, never introduced himself, could have been anyone.  He asked what the problem was, my husband and I told him and all that he was concerned about was refunding our money so the problem would go away.  Well, I told him it wasn't about the money and it was not the point.  He implied that we were lying and said everything is on tap and he will look at it.  He also said he will talk to the chef and walks away...so we wait again - at least another 10 minutes and he reappears. He says he checked temps of the food, silverware was clean, spoke to the chef, and all was well. I said to him that his checking NOW was an hour+ later was a rather mute point since numerous people have eaten (1 hour later).  Again, offering to refund our money, my response was still the same. He then says he will be right back again, to never returned.    My opinion and my opinion only, I DO NOT RECOMMEND anyone going there.  When the Gold Coast was owned by the Gaughan family, it was a fine place to go, but now, forget it! Save your money."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  It's a great buffet, for the price ;) . The problem is that the price keeps going up and up and up.   It went from $9.99, to 11.99, to $13 in the past 3 months!   If it goes up one more time I am done."}
{"text":"Not bad for a cheap buffet close to the strip. Food is mediocre at best, but it beats paying $35 at a strip casino, if you are on a budget. Obviously you did much better food at any other casino, but hey, lunch was only $7.99 with the loyalty card, so you can't beat that, right? I wouldn't bother with the more expensive meals, since the place is just mediocre."}
{"text":"CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP.  Food was pretty good and you cant beat the price! We played keno while we ate which was fun.   I would go back for sure. Lots of options and great for the price. Try the chocolate pie/cake. So yummy."}
{"text":"The breakfast buffet was very good for the price.  However, our server was basically non-existent.  After giving us our drinks, he never once came back for re-fills or to take our used plates away.  If it weren't for the bad service, I would give Ports O Call 5 stars considering the low price."}
{"text":"I could honestly say that I love this buffet! Although I've only eaten here for breakfast, I think it's great. It is not packed like other buffet's in the strip would be, and they serve decent food that wont make you sick. They have the regular pancakes, toast, waffles, and \"made to order\" omelettes, and on the side they have the dessert table which serves a variety of different cakes and pies, best (banana cream pie, sprinkled chocolate cake) yum. The waiters-waitresses are very polite and tend to you quickly. I have never eaten here for lunch or dinner so I wouldn't recommend going during lunch and dinner but I will recommend breakfast. The only reason they don't get five stars is because Gold Coast to me seems more like a senior citizen hotel, I mean all I saw in the buffet were senior citizens, it's more of like a relaxing-quiet place not like hotels in the strip."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst buffet I've been to in my life.  I asked the waitress for butter to dip my shrimp into and she said if it wasn't up there, they didn't have it.  I then asked the cooks for butter and they said it would take 10 minutes because it was frozen WTH. The selection was limited and the food taste was very poor. Never stopping here again."}
{"text":"A large group went to buffet on Thanksgiving. We have been there on past Thanksgivings and were pleased with the food quality and variety. Not this year. No boiled shrimp, no full roasted turkey only turkey breast. The sweet potato pie and eggnog cheesecake were tasteless. The Orange duck was very tough. Service was good, but did not compensate for the poor food. Way overpriced for what we received."}
{"text":"For the price, 3.5 stars is fair.  The same weekend I went to the circus circus Buffy and the spice market buffet and it was def better than the circus circus buffet.  It wouldn't be fair to compare to the higher end Vegas buffets.  The had selections from Asian, Mexican, American...dessert.  The one time I stayed at this hotel they gave me 2 free buffet coupons, not sure if that's always how it works but if you are down on Vegas luck and need a good deal, it's a good option.  I actually like to gamble here a bit every trip since they got low minimum craps and roulette and there are never douche bags here."}
{"text":"Yet another junk and a waste of time and money on this Friday night for us. Probably the best product they got going there are the fruits. Everything else from Mexican, American, Asian, Italian to Desserts and Ice Creams were nothing special or should we say pathetic in some cases. My friends used to come here swear that the crab legs used to be a lot bigger and taste better. Crab legs from some cheap buffet in town can easily beat Port O'calls by a mile. We might have given this buffet two or three stars if the price was drastically lower but today we simply don't see the value. This is the worst bang for your buck. We paid $22.99 each and could have spent our money elsewhere and be happier for sure."}
{"text":"This place gets a solid 4. They probably have the best price for a buffet, especially if you sign up for their free players card. The breakfast is normally $8.99, but with the base level card it is $6.99 and just gets cheaper the higher level card you have. Their buffet is kind of basic (scrambled eggs, bacon, pancakes, etc) but they do have a make your own omelette station and the servers are pretty attentive.   This place is a must if you're on a budget and starving!"}
{"text":"What an awesome deal! It might not be as aesthetically visually pleasing compared to Caesars, Mirage, Encore, MGM, Palm & the rest of the 'popular trendy' hotels but by goodness, foods provided are still quality & a wide assortment! And COST EFFICIENT! FYI: I consider myself a buffet snob"}
{"text":"Food was just okay, not a big selection. For the price you pay it is good considering what the rest of the buffets in Vegas cost."}
{"text":"Good food for a really good price. Good variety, everything tasted great, very clean. The desserts were spectacular!"}
{"text":"Muy mala la comida. El peor buffet que he ido. Tiene comida variada pero tiene sabor a comida recalentada y vieja"}
{"text":"Plenty of options, tasty and great price, we dined at lunch time.  We would happily dine there again."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst buffet I've ever been to.  Better off going to a sizzler, golden corral, old country buffet or any Chinese buffet.  I expected better from a Vegas buffet.  Omg they are so bad they can't even satisfied my 5 and 7 years old and they charge kids over 4 years full price.  They lack variety and selection on a saturday night.  They don't have hamburger or fried chicken and no cookies or jello for the kids.  Oh and to fill up the empty spaces in the cold buffet they put FAKE apples, oranges, bananes and other vegetables in it.  So if you you want to make yourself a banana split....better off going home.  It is a sad sad buffet."}
{"text":"Great food for the price!! Prime rib rocks, and Thursday nights is all you can eat steak!!!"}
{"text":"have been here a few times before, the food was decent, not the best i've had, but decent :), plus the price isnt over the top"}
{"text":"YUCK! so a typical breakfast buffet is $5.99 monday thru saturday.  which is an amazing price!!  $5.99 for powdered eggs and soggy bacon...okay, thats tolerable.  i would be thinking \"u get for what u pay.\"   sundays are $10.99 for their sunday brunch.  at their suday brunch, they have a wide array of foods from mexican to asian.  for desserts they have sugar free options as well as soft serve.  great variety!!  interesting enough this buffet boasts about the amount of food items avaliable...how about the quality u may ask?  so...they have an entire island devoted to breakfast....u would think bc u pay $10.99 for the sunday brunch it would be better quality.  think again....whether its $5.99 or $10.99 u still gonna get powdered eggs and soggy bacon. if ur happy with wide variety of food items this is the place to go!  if u want to eat delicious food...keep looking."}
{"text":"Had lunch there yesterday at 2:30.  People were friendly but the wait staff took too long to check in with sodas and keeping the table clean. It wasn't busy. Ate 90% salad bar and it was ok.  The veggies in the specialty areas were \"tired\" looking and tried a couple but were over done (brussel sprouts and green beans).  Maybe they're better earlier."}
{"text":"The food is worth the money. $6.99 for breakfast and they have an omelette bar where you pick out your own ingredients. But our waitress Maria was horrible. Very unfriendly and not just to us. You can tell she was the same way with the tables around us."}
{"text":"Decent grub for the price.  Whenever we're in vegas and need a quick, cheap, and good buffet...we go to Gold Coast or South Point.  The staff is really friendly."}
{"text":"Loved it here. Food was fresh, staff was amazing. You can't beat the price, and the selection was changed daily."}
{"text":"Selective foods were very cooked well some made me sick, the spaghetti was very plastic taste like and so the water was sitting for a bit. Buk  choi  was not steamed long enough broccoli was not steamed long enough ither. Some foods again were great but the customer service is was lacked the most  Didn't appreciate Mary our waiter being as discombobulated  as I would think she was rude attitude orientated and she never came around to check on us. Nor thanked us nothing so we left she nor did not pick up plates we rarely saw her walking around"}
{"text":"If any management is reading this, we went at about 8pm on 7/25/16. The food was good, about a 4 star meal. The service at the table was ok, about 3 stars. Then we get to the dessert....I first was assisted by a white guy with a goatee, he was super nice, friendly, helpful, smiling. So I tell my 78 year old friend about the good help at the dessert station, get him over there. We are standing at the gelato area, and the white guy is putting trays away, you know, working. It's about 8:52pm. They close at 9pm so we purposefully hurried. The older Mexican lady comes out from the back oor, looks at us, and flashes this look like, \"OMG I can't believe I have to help someone!\" So she comes over and sort of raises her eyebrows as if that takes the place of, \"may I help you?\" So I ask if we can get a scoop of chocolate in a cone. She grabs a bowl. I reiterate that I want mine in a cone (after she gives my friend a small scoop in a bowl that was so super small it might fill up a 3 year old. Maybe). She glances to the side, I look at her like \"what?\" she glances to the side, gestures, mumbles something, I have no idea what she is saying. I look over and see the soft serve. I say I want a cone, she motions over, I go walking over, and there is a cone dispenser. Why didn't she just politely ask me to go get a cone?!?!?! Ridiculous! Does she speak English? I assume she does. But no words that were coherent were ever spoken. It was just so rude and a terrible ending to the night. Dessert area due to her gets a half star. Only because that lady ruined our evening."}
{"text":"Seriously, I had my doubts, but we decided to try it.  It was very good. Bellagio, no, but very good for the price point.  PS- All you need to do on Fridays is play slots or video poker for a minute, swipe your players card at the koisk, and it will print out a 50% off coupon... Half off is always good!!!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, service was fine, but the girl ringing us up made a mistake that took a long time to fix."}
{"text":"First time trying this buffet.  The food was not tasty at all. The seafood was really fishy. The crawfish wasn't cleaned well. The other food I tried such as the ribs & pork chop tasted funny. Overall quality of the food was unsatisfactory. And to top it off, I had food poisoning from this place. However, the only thing good about this buffet was the service. I didn't get our waitress name. But she was very sweet, friendly, and she cares about her customer."}
{"text":"Not the best buffet in town, but definitely cheap. My most recent visit was Sunday night for prime rib dinner. It's pretty cheap especially if someone has a player's card. Our waiter was very attentive and always refilled our drinks/took our plates away. Usually isn't very crowded.  The food is not all that great though. Not a huge selection, and not the best tasting. The prime rib was nothing special. Of course, you probably shouldn't expect too much out of cheap buffets."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and they were favorable food is good price is amazing to come to Vegas I come to realize that all the buffets and all the hype never really add up to $43 per person 799 a person well I guess I'm living in the 80s but I do enjoy discounted food in Vegas and ports of call to Gold Coast it's a homerun sure service is a bit tired and a little laxed but who cares at 799 and it's yourself and grandpa wife and kids were all in"}
{"text":"For the money, this is one of the best values in Las Vegas buffet world.  Seven separate line counters, each themed with a different region's cuisine.  You get what you pay for though, and overall this buffet is heavy and might leave you feeling a bit ill.  We cleansed with salads that night."}
{"text":"We were extremely surprised at the quality of the Friday night seafood buffet at the Ports o' Call Buffet. The seafood selection was across the board very good, with plentiful crab legs, steamed and cold. I especially liked the taste of their New England Clam Chowder. Not too thin, not too thick, with just the right amount and size of chunks of potato and clam. According to my friend, the fired oysters were all breading and not at all juicy. The pizza leaves something to be desired, but overall, for the price and selection, we'll go back!"}
{"text":"We were staying next door at the Rio hotel, but came here every day for the breakfast buffet. This was just over $10 and they had everything we get at other buffets including fresh made-to-order omelettes. The service was good and we were seated immediately. I would recommend this if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I'm sad I didn't even take any photos while I visited this place.    On Mother's Day my parents and and went here for lunch.  I have to say it's a pretty big buffet.  So many choices.  When I remember the most was the ox tail stew. It was amazing with rice.   That was something I went back for.  Everything else was what you expect from a typical American buffet.  They had Asian fusion assortment, Tex mex, amer Italian, and much more.  They have a huge array of desserts including soft serve ice cream, gelato and a chocolate fountain.  Not to mention the sugar free selections.  For me.  I enjoyed the veggies and the ox tail.  I would actually come back her to have the ox tail stew.    Stars   1 star for service.  Staff was very friendly and always there to assist you and take your finished plate 1 star for facilities 1 star for food 1 star for over all experience.  -star for restrooms didn't use.  But I do like how hand sanitizer is available at the buffet."}
{"text":"Went in today for Sunday brunch. It is $17.99 plus tax. Food selection isn't that great. New York steak was tough, fried chicken very dry. I ate mostly crab legs & shrimp scampi and they're just okay. I would say I get what I paid for since this price is the cheapest I found for brunch out of the seven restaurants I called. Sadly, I wont be coming back. Service is great but I would prefer to pay additional $5- $10 to get better selection & tastier food in a nearby buffet."}
{"text":"Only ate here cause I was staying at this hotel. Poor service, very poor selection and old dessert. I won't ever go back. Also lots of dirty tables."}
{"text":"I'm a person of value. If I'm not satisfied with what I paid for, I'll say it, but I'm not that hard to please. As for this particular buffet, I went in for the brunch. And with the player's card, you get two bucks off per person, making the Sunday brunch only 11 bucks. It's really not as bad as it seems. Some people really insult this place in almost comparing it to hometown buffet but give me a break. They serve pretty good quality food. A good variety except the Mexican foods( I don't like the mexican foods at buffet cause it's not authentic). The only flaw is its prime rib and its service. By my fifth plate, our waitress left our table stranded and we had almost 10 half/finished plates stacked up. Maybe it was because she was a bit overweight and had mobile issues but I don't like eating next to finished plates. Nevertheless, with the exception of its service, the food is definitely worth its value. Omlettes were very tasty as well!"}
{"text":"This could be three stars if I ate here enough times to know what to eat, but I don't think I'll eat here enough times to get to that point, but who knows?  It is cheaper than eating at a buffet on the strip, and it may even be a buck cheaper than its sister property, the Orleans, but if other choices were available, it would take a half off coupon to get me to eat here.  That said, this property does run a lot of promotions to get discounted food, especially for seniors. But I'm not a senior, and I get only $1.00 off for having a B-Connected card.    One thing going for this place is that the buffet is not at all crowded.   Another is that for the price (even regular price), they have a pretty good selection. Where the ratings drop is the overall quality of the food.  I went on prime rib night.  The prime rib was okay - it was bland and a little tough - about a 4 on a scale of 1 - 10.  The mussels were okay also, give those about a 5.  The chow mein, I liked - it was a little sweeter and chewier, and the noodles were a bit thinner than what you would expect - it was nicely different - about a 6.5.  There was some spicy vegetable dish that rated about a 5 also.  I should have quit while I was ahead.  Or I could have tried an enchilada, had some fried fish, made myself a taco, had a slice of pizza, but instead, I had the imitation crab salad and Wor Won Ton Soup.   The soups disappointed me.  I opened the top, looked inside, and decided to pass.  But in the Chinese food section, there was Wor Won Ton Soup.  Although it just won ton dumplings and broth, I had to try some.  It was less than mediocre - the broth tasted like chicken cubes melted in hot water, and the won ton dumplings were so bland that it didn't even absorb any of the broth's saltiness.   What ended my meal was the imitation crab salad. I don't know how it is on other nights, but on this night, this was a one star, and after a couple of bites, I was done eating. This entree just zapped the appetite right out of me."}
{"text":"This by far was the worst quality buffet I've been to in Vegas. I don't understand how it's possible to serve cold hard food. Usually at a buffet there are so many choices, but the choices were less than appetizing. Not one thing was tasty, it was generic and disappointing. I'm trying to think of something good, but have come to a point where I'll be honest...with all the buffets and choices in Vegas, please don't go here."}
{"text":"Well, the price was good. The price of lunch was $9.99. If you have a Be-connected card, you will get an extra $1 off. I realize that the service usually meets the price-but this was quite terrible. My family and I waited over 10 minutes to get a drink. We asked two people for drinks and they both replied to wait.  After we got our drinks we never got a refill or even an offer of one. The sushi was worse than gas station sushi. The variety of dishes were different, however, everything tastes the same. The salad was fresh.  The salad was of public school cafeteria level.  I would have been happier to get a $10 meal somewhere else and would have tipped more generously.  I still tipped because I am a former waitress.  As a former waitress, I realize that multiple factors need to be considered in the restaurant business."}
{"text":"Reviews for this place seem to be all over the map. I guess I don't know what people really expect for food that's actually very good and most certainly at a terrific price. Is it on par with it's high-priced competitor just to its east (where I've also eaten)? No, but with such a reasonable price there's no way they could.  Our family went to this buffet twice, once for dinner and once for breakfast. The food was quite good for both visits, and the desserts are definitely something to leave room for.  You get variety, freshness (unless you wait until just before they close for the meal), and decent quality. My picky kids (8 to 17) had no complaints and plenty of options to choose from. The fruit was fresh and plentiful.  Service was terrific for dinner and lousy for breakfast. Like most places, I guess it depends on who you get.    Dislikes:  Pass on the coffee. To get chocolate milk you have to go to the dessert bar and make your own."}
{"text":"I am giving them 1 STAR. Friday is supposedly a \"Seafood Friday\" and for years people would come here for the crab legs. But since March 1, without any announcement, they stopped serving this. They said that all Boyd Gaming food establishments have stopped serving crab legs. There's a lot of unhappy customers, including my group of 10, who were so dissapointed. The place used to be filled up to the brim every Friday but now the place is half-full or half-empty however you may see it. STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Didnt have high hopes, but had to use my $10 buffet credit on special hotel stay promotion. Right away a key highlight was the super chunky blue cheese dressing at the salad bar. One side of that bar with the veggies/salad stuff was good, the other side seemed like time had passed it by with some ugly looking fancier salads and hard rolls. Some decent surprises on the main line involved chicken.  The mazaltan chicken had a zesty sauce and cheese, orange chicken was a whole breast in orange sauce, chicken kiev was white meat encased in crust and another chinese chicken dish was good.  The italian side needed work, on this night, but some other good finds were carved turkey, the taco section and fresh rolled tortillas, fried banana, rice pilaf and finally the chocolate mouse pie was a happy ending, but skip the tiramisu. Plates were cleared and drinks refilled. Overall food was good for my $3 total after discount.      Back for lunch and my final credit and the dishes got even more impressive and only for $7.99 with card or free with my promotion. The highlights were the Fried ravioli with tasty marinara dipping sauce, the freshly prepared chicken and your choice of veggies dish from the Mongolian Grill in a semi-spicy sauce, the chicken fajitas with huge strips of peppers and white meat chicken, the hushpuppes and even the chicken soup was decent. Even the garlic bread was buttery and hot. Sampled the chocoalte cake for desert and that also was rich and a great ending to two surprisingly good buffets at the Gold Coast."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by stating  that there are plenty of fine buffets in Vegas that are located off the Strip.  Unfortunately, this is not one of them.  The food lacks any kind finesse, flavor, and love.  For example, you got your choice of overly well prime rib, super dry fish, or pasta that was never close to being al dente. And don't forget the blah selection of wilted greens and stuff  from the salad bar.  Which I guess is kinda to be expected considering how little I paid for dinner.  So if you're ever feeling nostalgic for mediocre cafeteria food, this would be your place."}
{"text":"Again, my friend had the $90 food credit to use at the Gold Coast restaurants so this meal was basically for $5 per person for us.  Woo hoo!  There is nothing special though at this buffet.  I liked the beef brisket, which looked dry, but it's juicy and flavorful.  Nice & fatty, just like how I like it.  The other good thing, the fried clam pieces.  The pineapple chicken legs were tasty.  That's pretty much it.  The desserts looked good, but I was too full to have any of it.  The only dessert I had was the ice cream cone, which isn't self-serve.  They have 4 different flavors of ice cream, but I only could handle vanilla.... which tastes kinda crappy.  Now, I don't discriminate against crappy food or desserts so of course I finished it.  Doesn't mean that it tasted good.  I mean, it's gotta taste really bad for me not to finish it."}
{"text":"Typical buffet in lower cost vegas. It catered more to the \"senior\" palate. But that was livable but the down side is, dont expect to get what you see in the dessert section. YOu see this wonderful looking cheesecake and ask for a slice and they give you a really dried out , chewey old piece that has been out for awhile. Yuck! So beware, stick to cookies ( even those looked like cow patties, seriously  lol)"}
{"text":"My family had the Sunday Brunch on the day before Christmas and I don't think it save your budget if you have young children. the food is OK for $16.99. I have 4 and 6 years old kids, but they charged me the full price for both of them. I didn't pay so I didn't know that until i read the fine print in the food mat paper. It said that children under 42 inches eat free. My daughter around 41 inches, but since the cashier lady measured by eyes, so she rounded it up. Definitely the young kids can't it as much as adults' portion. I will not recommend any families with young children to there since you can get better food and a discount for your kids from other buffets."}
{"text":"This is not a fancy Buffet Restaurant. It is convenient and cheaper than most in the area. The food is what you would probably see at a Golden Corral or Home Town Buffet. Well maybe slightly better than those two, but certainly not like the buffets that you see at the M casino. The service is quick and typically the long lines moved fairly fast."}
{"text":"Great buffet ! Fresh and tasty foods. Mix and match to your hearts content.Great dessert selections!  Excellent wait staff ... quick seating, lots of  parking, no huge crowds. This is what a buffet on the Strip should be like.Must try when in Vegas... you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"PRICES: Excellent prices... breakfast, lunch or dinner! PARKING:  Private lot.  Plenty of parking.  Close.  Good location. QUALITY:  Fresh food, if you come at the beginning each mealtime.  At the end of meal time, the trays get picked pretty clean. CUSTOMER SERVICE:  Everyone from the cashier, hostess and servers were very helpful and polite. FOOD:  A \"wide\" variety of food, you just can't best it.  Be sure to check out the pictures! PERKS:  Get a Players Card and you get a discount off the already inexpensive prices."}
{"text":"Where else can you eat like a king on a paupers budget!?   Breakfast lunch or dinner, this place will keep you satisfied.    The selection isn't huge but of good quality and the service is always good.  The lines are never too long and the tables are always clean.   If you're hungry and staying at the hotel, this is the best place to be. Make sure to catch the ship at port o call buffet.   If you play here be sure to ask for a comp from the player club or put boss.   You're welcome."}
{"text":"The food is OK for the price.   Service is subpar, definitely a give-no-Fs attitude on some of the staff. Lady guiding people to tables was randomly attitudinal for no reason. You'll see one drink brought when you are finishing your first plate and then you will never see your server again. Also had to clean sticky stuff off the seat myself, which required a search for a server station to get napkins, since they only provide you with one.   It's all about the price, though. This is the cheapest casino buffet short of the breakfast offering at Station casinos (which is a little better if you can get to one of those)."}
{"text":"Buffets are a dime a dozen in Vegas, but this was recommended to us by our hotel concierge as the most affordable because it was off the Strip. Since I was traveling with such a large number of people (24+), we didn't want to spend too much on a meal especially 18% gratuity and tax add up to some serious dought!    We came for their Friday evening's Seafood Night special, but I can't really remember anything special about it.   The food were hits or misses, but leaned towards misses and some \"semi-hits\". The buffet was sectioned off by ethnic specialties so people can choose their favorites. I remembered there were one version of fried food after another. The most unfortunate dish I ate was the disgustingly gross raw oyster and I usually love oysters! Their desserts were decent but I wanted more fruits or even healthier options. Was I asking for too much?  Seriously I had better experiences at buffets in L.A. Oh well!"}
{"text":"Fresh, flavorful food and lots of choices, including a gelato bar! This buffet is a good value... half the price when compared to the fancy hotels on the strip or even across the street at Rio. If you have a players club card you get an extra $2 off, so it was $14.06 for the prime rib dinner buffet (tax included). I will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Honest review time  FOOD The food variety was good. But, a big but, most of the food was WACK! The seafood section had some fish that was dry and flakey. At least go get some fresh fish yeah?  The Mongolian section had few appealing choices and the meat was very dry. The sweet and sour pork was probably the best choice for the Chinese section. Otherwise everything else was wack. I found a piece of plastic in the sour tasting kimchi. -1 star. The bbq America section was the worst. The corn beef tasted like rubber and left a salty aftertaste in my mouth that couldn't be washed out except with a nice sip of raspberry tea. The Italian section looked faked af so we steered clear of that section. The quesadilla in the Mexican section was uncooked and gooey.  DESSERT As we walked by the dessert bar, we were interested in their many pies they had to offer. BUT after choosing our picks, the cakes tastes artificial and the lemon meringue pie had FAKE FOAM on top. The ice cream scoops were the size of golf balls so you should ask for three scoops. They are incorrectly labeled as well.  Thank you for reading this long review  TLDR: for $10 id rather go buy myself a movie and starve while watching that instead of coming here and \"feasting\"  on this"}
{"text":"$10.00 for lunch with a huge variety is amazing.  They had lots of desserts that actually had flavor unlike some other buffets.  Mirage Cravings buffet cost at least twice as much and it wasn't any better.  Save your money and eat at the Gold Coast buffet."}
{"text":"Sweet little gem inside the Gold Coast!   We came here for lunch and cracked up at the fact that this is definitely a hotel for the MUCH older elderly crowd, lol. We stopped at the buffet though and were really impressed with all of the choices we had for food. Chinese, American, Mongolian,  seafood, Italian, tons of fruits, veggies, desserts, and much, much more. The selection of food is fantastic for lunch, and DIRT CHEAP! Only 8.99 for all of that food.   The inside is very large and tables are spaced out, and the place is clean. Definitely no complaints about room. The wait staff is awesome and kept our plates cleaned up and our drinks full faithfully.   I'd definitely make it a point to stop here for some cheap eats and a full belly."}
{"text":"Its ports o call! hurry, quick call yo mama.  this is a super cheap buffet that is very descent in a good location!  i was left shocked, i expected school cafe food but instead got restaurant food.   thurs is all you can eat! fantastic  Didnt like that the food was cold (i.e. french fries) but i figured people dont come ehre to eat the french fries.   i shall come here again, especially when i want a full tummy and full wallet when i leave."}
{"text":"We paid $15.99 on Christmas Day & the buffet was supposed to have turkey,ham,& special holiday trimmings.The turkey was cafeteria style processed meat turkey slices,the ham was school cafeteria quality,& I did'nt any real special trimmings.The buffet was not worth over $10.Even at $9.99,that's pushing it!I should have been more careful & asked to see the buffet line before going in to pay but I trusted a non-yelp buffet rating review site & it must be outdated because it ain't that good now...maybe years ago,but not today."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here bc we got a 2 for 1 coupon in the mail. We have been to the Gold Coast numerous times and we have eaten at Ping Pang Pong and the Noodle Exchange. I paid only around 7 bucks for both of us. The place looked nice and clean. So, about the food...I'm pretty sure the employees do there best and work very hard but most of the food did not look  appetizing at all. I only tried the prime rib (which was tough), salad, fried okra, rice pilaf, watermelon, mango ice cream, and passionfruit sorbet. Everything else (except the desserts) looked fried, frozen, canned, or just plain old. The pizza crust on the pizza was so obviously frozen bc the outside crust looked like cardboard. I would put this buffet on the bottom of my Vegas buffet list. Go to Ping Pang Pong 30 steps away and you will have 100x better food.."}
{"text":"Went there on steak night. Didn't have a big selection of food. Steak cooked just the way u like it.Liked fried oysters and cheese cake ice cream. I think it was $12"}
{"text":"Definitely not a swanky or fancy buffet, but that's why you're getting such a discounted price to eat there.   They have the usual buffet \"classics\" like American, Chinese, Italian, Mexican, with a salad and dessert bar.   The food was comped, and even if it wasn't, I would still pay to eat here, but the service is horrible and the waitresses seem to make you fell like you're bugging them when you ask for refills on drinks or extra napkins.  Step it up Gold Coast, inexpensive doesn't mean poor customer service."}
{"text":"Don't go.  The lamest buffet I've ever participated in.  If you're staying at the Gold Coast, just walk accross the street to the Palms buffet.  At least the food didn't hurt me belly. For that, I give it two stars."}
{"text":"I stopped by for the Friday seafood buffet. They have a promotion where once you get 10 points you can swipe your card and the kiosk for 50% off. Pretty good deal!  The selection was great. They had a raw oyster and clam section. Also had fried oysters and oysters rockefeller. Snow crab legs were available whole and halved. The crab legs were pretty good - not overcooked and very sweet."}
{"text":"Man this place is really bad.  The family and I came here on Friday night. Believe me this wasn't our first choice to eat but we were starving and this was the closest buffet. On Friday night, the special was crab legs. So it's 27.99 a person including kids. My kids are 7-8 and don't eat as nearly as much as my wife and I but the lady at the cash register said on Friday's EVERYONE is 27.99. So just make note of that.  The selection is abysmal to say the least. Food stations are not updated, plates aren't that nearly as washed and clean. Food is alright. They had spaghetti and some pasta which wasn't good at all. Pizza tasted like microwave. I did enjoy the prime rib but it wasn't outstanding. Last but not least the crab legs are really SMALL. Had better crab legs at other buffets not even at Vegas. All on all save your money and your appetite on somewhere else."}
{"text":"While the buffet is cheap with a players card ($10) it's not even worth it, at all. I think there was 2 items I found edible. Chicken teriyaki, and the Spanish rice. everything else was OLD and nasty looking. Not only that, but the selection was not great (on a Sunday night, too!)  Dessert station was a waste of space, just a bunch of pie and some soft serve.  The server was like 80 wearing a ridiculous amount of makeup. She looked like she just crawled out of \"fear and loathing in las vegas\"- not a good look, she also smelled like cigarettes and when I asked her how she was doing, all she said was fine and looked at me impatiently as if I was inconveniencing her by asking how she was before giving her my drink order.   Won't return here at all."}
{"text":"First visit to Gold Coast buffet was yesterday for brunch and definitely won't be our last! For price, service and quality rate this as a must visit. With basic ruby player card got $1 discount so paid $16.99 each and well worth it. Brunch includes seafood such as larger than typical crab legs and claws, oysters, salmon etc. Good dessert selection and you can dip strawberries in the chocolate fountain. Champagne included for Sunday brunch and our waitress Arlene kept our glasses full and was personable and showed she cared about her customers experience. Clean and well kept. Not your higher end buffet like Caesars Bacchanal but much more bang for the buck. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Pretty yummy. Came here on 4/4/15. Was pretty cheap for two people about $30ish total.   They have a good selection, not too shabby. I was really craving a seafood type buffet but the boyfriend told me he use to always come here so we gave it a try. They have a seafood (a bit small and the crawfish wasn't that good, but good fried oysters) bar, mexican, Italian, and an asian bar. And there was a salad bar, with soups also.   I didn't try as much as a wanted, to be honest I was a bit buzzed already and just stuffed myself pretty quick. The service was very quick though, we ordered our drinks and our waiter was fairly prompt and when we needed our dishes cleared he was always around.   I'd come back if I was on a budget and wanted to munch out."}
{"text":"Seafood and steak nights are OK, buffet has a nice variety of food, but nothing in it was really that amazing. For a cheap buffet, they have it figured out."}
{"text":"I love this buffet it is my go to spot in Vegas before I hit the road out of town.  It is very underrated.  It is not on the strip it is more a place where locals go to get some grub on the weekend.  It is price right about $9 for lunch.  There is plenty to choose from.  Asian, American, Mexican, Italian and more.  There is a lot of deserts too.  I normally go for lunch so I don't know what is served at Dinner, but there is plenty of quality food.  My faves are the cheese enchiladas.    Service is fast, the servers always make sure you have plenty to drink.  Give it a shot its inside the gold coast."}
{"text":"My mom loves this place and thought I should check it out!  Let's just say both times I've been I'm so glad I didn't pay for this cramp! The prime rib was awful and tuff! The only thing I ate was self made tacos and the chicken noddle soup...Hell even the diet coke was nasty! Everything else looked like dog sh*t! THEY ONLY REASON I gave this place 2stars is because my mom's loves this place and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. 8.99 I believe with a memeber card. The time when I want varieties, i go to a buffet.   Food was mediocre. Typical breakfast items. Powder eggs. Sausage, hash, bacon. French toast pancakes. French toast was rock hard! Fresh fruits. They had a omelet station so that was a plus. The orange juice gave me a stomach ache.   Service was good and friendly though.  I came here expecting mediocre food since price was cheap. Overall well worth the cheap price.   Cheap okay food for 8.99. Can't beat that anywhere in vegas! Just go with low expectation so that way you can enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Breakfast is a pretty fair price for a buffet (Monday - Saturday $7.99). I feel some dinner prices are pretty pricey for being off the strip. They have a nice selection of food. We visited for dinner on a Tuesday night and food was fresh. We also visited on Saturday night (BBQ dinner). I wasn't impressed with the BBQ dinner. The only BBQ I saw was ribs, they also had burgers, turkey burgers, fries and baked beans. This Saturday buffet was $15.99 (before players card discounts). During lunch & dinner they also have pizza, pasta and nice size salad bar with fruit. I love the dessert bar (would love to see the crushed up candy/Oreos come back for ice cream toppings). Nice selection of desserts."}
{"text":"I find the buffet here bland and sub-par, as previously mentioned briefly in my Gold Coast review (http://www.yelp.com/biz/gold-coast-hotel-and-casino-las-vegas-3#hrid:p6j8UNUSrk-JCawQYGwy6A). I will say that the service is good and reasonably priced when compared to other Vegas buffets. And rarely crowded, so you're not waiting in line for 2 hours like in more popular buffets. As such, you will see that the clientele that resides here tend to be elderly, young families, and perhaps people who have lost too much cash at other casinos.  The best deal (and perhaps the only time I'd recommend eating here) may be during their seafood nights, which is Friday evening. Just stock up on cold crab legs and cocktail shrimp.  Grab a B Connected player's card for the membership discount price, and use up your points to help pay for your meal."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner, first night in Vegas.  Bad choice.  Food NOT good at all.   Even though prices are low compared to strip buffet...ends up being expensive because I really did not enjoy anything there.  Definitely would not come back or recommend.   Management need to review quality of food."}
{"text":"Located at Gold Coast Casino across the street from the Rio and Palms.    I've been here about 100 times before starting to yelp so clearly I like it. Lol. I live super close and didn't have a car when I first moved to LV but still enjoy the buffet. 4 star is fair for the overall value and service.   They still bring you drinks. Fast to get seated with big tables. You get seated close to the food usually. Clean and maintained.   Food is very hit and miss and nothing is spectacular. I have always get my money's worth. I usually start with a big salad and lots of fruit. Things I like most are the biscuits and gravy, you get 3 options on gravy. Omelette bar, ask for fresh cracked egg. Waffles are okay if you get them fresh, you can ask them to make a little batch.   Lunch and dinner I like the fish and meats. Clam strips when a fresh batch comes. I just keep it basic and don't come real hungry and do okay.  Holiday special meals here are very good value though. I don't gamble but people that do get comps easy. I often come with people that got free entry or buy 1 get 1 which makes it way good value.   I haven't been here in 6 months at least but most of the staff remembered me well and were very nice. Few actually very happy to see me which was nice of them. Great service makes it hard not to round to 4 star.   I'll be back for sure when needing a quick bite and not hungry especially for $8 breakfast."}
{"text":"So. Originally my review was 4 stars. $6 dollars with the house card, great food and great service.  Except no.  We ate at the buffet twice. Once for breakfast and once for dinner. The stomach pains started that night and lasted almost two days. It was the sickest I've been and still been walking around.  I consistently wasn't sure if I would get to a bathroom in time for 30 hours straight.  Once we started eating different food, (TGI Fridays) I started to see a completely healthy Meg emerge. But not after several of our party became varying levels of sick, with myself at the helm.  Ports O Call Buffet, never again. Never EVER again."}
{"text":"We had their dinner. It was about 14 a person and absolutely underwhelming. My best advice is to say save your money and run to in and out burger. For 75% less you can get a meal that you actually enjoy! Run, jog, walk do whatever you can to avoid this food you won't be impressed at least with their dinner. The staff was nice, not their fault."}
{"text":"It's not what I'm used to but I like their selection here.  I tried the broccoli yesterday when we came for Lunch.  I have to say I was grossed out by the cheese they used on it. I normally recommend this place.. but I guess they have been cutting back like the Luxor has. For that I'll rate it as A-OK for the price.  I did notice the Fried Rice was especially great, had more flavor than usual,  still a bit bland though.  I loved the Soft tacos I made, wish they had sliced black olives. I tried using whole black olives but they tasted awful.  No big deal I left it off the taco.  I have to say the price you can't complain but the green beans were really old. as seen in the picture I snapped.  I left disappointed thinking they might of gotten better.  This experience just didn't cut it for A-OK this time.. I've experienced Better.  Plus the cashier that rang us up Edna was saying I couldn't use my Buy One get one on Bconnected Mobile app.  YUP!   I flash my App at The Orleans and they just zap it with the bar reader!!!  There's a bar code reader right there on the desk and she tells me \"We don't accept those you have to get a voucher from the Players club.\"  That's not what the APP says on the fine print!  \"Show this to your cashier at the buffet.  Excludes Gold Coast Friday night dinner.\""}
{"text":"I went on a Friday when they had their seafood dinner buffet. Originally, it cost $17.99 and when I checked the Gold Coast Hotel website, if you join their club card, they knock off $1. Whoo hoo, I thought (thinking that's an extra $1 I could give to the waithelp for standing in line for 5 minutes to sign up for their free card). Come to find out when I went to the buffet cashier, depending on what level you're at (Emerald, Sapphire, Ruby in descending order), they have different discounts. Coming directly from the club card desk, I assume I'm a Ruby but they gave me 2 for 1 discount coming to under $10 for just me.  The buffet line had your standby non-gourment items (fried chicken, popcorn shrimp, prime rib, etc), but what I ended up doing is getting 3 mound-full dishes of snow crab, shrimp cocktail, manila clams, and oysters rockerfeller.  The dessert selection was plentiful but as others have mentioned, don't expect Bellagio quality items for sure.  But for $10 for a seafood buffet, my tummy was happy ;-)!!"}
{"text":"The fresh egg and omelet station was excellent. Crispy bacon, sausage links, fresh melon and pineapple, Apple crepes, Apple dumplings, hash browns, and chorizo and eggs were all very good.  I would say they need to 86 the fruit cocktails and the other #10 cans of fruit, and opt for the fresh fruit basket.  Service was prompt and courteous.   Coffee and orange juice good, but the tea tastes like instant. Great value for $6.99!"}
{"text":"You cannot beat the $9.99 lunch price. It is a very basic buffet so don't expect anything extravagant but that's why the price is so low.  I found most of the food good, loved the manicotti in alfredo sauce. The roast beef was decent too. They had 5 or 6 food stations including  mexican, mongolian, chinese,  american  etc.  plus a small salad station as well as a dessert station.  If you are looking for an  upscale buffet serving gourmet food head to the strip. Employees were very nice too!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast buffet. Best made to order omlets in the area. Dinner buffet was very good too."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst buffet I've been to. It had an odd oder. The food selection was very disappointing. The desert section had a nice selection of cakes. But the icecream bar did not have labels on any of the flavors. The staff were very friendly so that was nice. If you want to eat cheap, you are better off just going to a regular resturant. This buffets food choices were so lacking, you ultamately left hungry."}
{"text":"Nothing over the top. The food was okay. Decent selection. Food was hot. Waitress was nice,  keeping us filled with oj and coffee.  Fruit, bacon, creeps, omelets to order, mexican items, sausage links,  egg choices, waffles, pancakes, french toast, cream of wheat, cereals.  For the price you can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Well for the price this isn't all that bad they do have a variety of foods to choose from and the staff is friendly they do come by and check on you. So for a decent buffet at a good price you can come here."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday since I had a comp, otherwise I wouldn't have come here. They advertise it's \"land and sea\" day. When I think of seafood, I think of crab legs and stuff. They have a poor selection of seafood and not fresh at all. The raw oysters had a funny taste so, I stopped eating them because I was worried that I would get sick. The crawfish lacked any flavor and had a dirt taste. Gross!   On to the \"land\"part of the review. The beef they cut was so dry that the au jus sauce wasn't helping the dryness. It was like eating cardboard. That's unacceptable since I went there at 4pm (right when they opened). The ravioli tasted like chef boyardee from the can! The cheese pizza reminded me of the pizza I used to get in middle school cafeteria. The only thing that was really edible was the fried rice and mashed potatoes. The dessert wasn't great either except the poppy seed lemon bread. Wouldn't come here again, even when I have a comp."}
{"text":"After checking out of my room at the Rio, I had about 2 hours to kill before heading back to the airport and car rental place to return my vehicle.   Yelped up a cheap breakfast buffet and found the Ports'O'Call which was right across the street from the Rio. I was shocked at the price..came out to $8 (taxed too!) total on a weekday, so I wasn't expecting much.  But I was actually surprised in a good way, maybe my expectations were super low but I genuinely had a good meal here. Typical American breakfast food..eggs, waffles, sausages, hams, breakfast burritos, etc Nothing stood out about it, but it was solid. Decent amount of selection..food was HOT. And you can't really go wrong with donuts and breakfast danishes with hot coffee. I fixed myself about 3 plates of breakfast food and was full until I headed back home!  Restaurant is brightly lit. Tables are spaced out and there's a lot of room to sit without being cramped up. Service was good, honestly I had no complaints.  For cheap eats, if you're staying at the Rio/Palms. It's worth dropping into if you want to save some cash (I believe lunch was around $10, dinner $12) I don't know if I would venture all the way out here from the Strip to eat, but it's worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Very run down, feels like your in a 80s movie. Staff is in their own world, not rude but not very pleasant either. Food was OK, a lot of the food tasted old. Suggestion: go somewhere else spend the extra 15!! Or go to in and out!!"}
{"text":"An OK buffet.  Rare to find a buffet priced at $9.99 (with players card) these days.  Nice selection of choices...Seafood, Mongolian, American, Italian, and Mexican. Not much flavor with the prime rib...but priced right for a inexpensive quick fix for your hunger!"}
{"text":"This place is cheap and I was able to find enough food to satisfy myself but there's some weirdness to it as well. For example, the server set a tray full of dirty dishes on my table while I was eating, walked away, and left it there for about 5 minutes. I don't want to eat while looking at dirty dishes and chewed up watermelon rinds.   The custom omelette station made me add a star. Very delicious omelettes are made to order and served piping hot. I don't know if this is available for Sunday brunch only so be sure to check.   This place is conveniently located in the Gold Coast casino."}
{"text":"Buffets are a dime a dozen in Vegas, but I really enjoyed this one. It's not huge, but not small either. I went for breakfast during the week and brunch on Sunday. The breakfast was pretty cheap @ about $8. The brunch was $16, but it comes with Mimosas and they also have steak and eggs. I didn't try the lunch or dinner, but will next time. Also, you get a discount if you show your players club card."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. Yes you save some money but I would recommend not being cheap. Find one of the other major hotel buffets.   All of the food was dried out (not enough people eating here so the food sits for too long).   The hostess got all pissed off because the other hostess told us to go through so we sat down and were told the table was closed. Whatever, some mix up and the hostess got all worked up. Not our problem, direct us to the tables if that's your policy.   Our waiter put his friendly face on but I could tell the dude hated his job.   The prime rib was good.   I would not return here."}
{"text":"They have cocktail sauce but no type of seafood ... why put it out ? They have nacho chips but no cheese sauce ? Worst buffet ever I have experienced , I recommend everyone not to go here  if u want a bad experience ...smh"}
{"text":"Ugh, never again, at least not for a lunch buffet. I'm generally not too picky when it comes to buffets, but i really couldn't find anything that i wanted to eat twice, not even the pizza. The only saving grace was that there was a 2 for 1 special on christmas eve so it saved us $10 between the wife and i."}
{"text":"Ok I am going to start off by saying I am not a buffet loving fool!  I try to avoid them at all possible, but I was up in my room looking at the little advertiser they have on the table and saw breakfast buffet only 5.99, man they know how to talk to me. I got to the Gold Coast a day before my group did so I was eating solo, yep party of one at the buffet!   When the 5.99 price is if you're a player card holder, its 6.99 if you're not, so I went and got the players card.  Let me tell you, this breakfast buffet was good! They had everything you can think of, fresh egg station, pancakes, waffles, bacon BACON!!! Sausage, biscuits, gravy!!!  And so much more!  I opted for an egg omelet with onions, ham, bell peppers, jalapenos and olives, and got some home-style potatoes to go with! Found me the salsa bar and hit it with pico de gio and  hot sauce, the hotter the better I say and topped it with some sour cream!   That was a good breakfast! So when friends got into town, we all decided to try the buffet for the prime rib dinner for 11.99, and that my friends didn't disappoint either.  I also have to say I liked the variety of vegetables they had to offer.  I have to say I went a few times to the Ports O Call Buffet and wasn't disappointed at all!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. the prices are 15 for dinner and I cannot remember what I paid for breakfast. We at here one night and had some credits on a card from gambling there so  my dinner was 9 bucks!!! the have Chinese food ,italian ,Mexican , and American BBQ and of course desserts.. The foods are very good My fav was the bbq just because the night we were there they had ribs so my buddy and I went on a throw down :)"}
{"text":"I had lunch with a friend here. There wasn't a long line for lunch. We got seated and ordered our drinks. To my surprise the asian selections were really good. The staff were nice and our waiter kept refilling out drinks without asking. It's $12.99 for lunch but just applied for the players card and it's $9.99. DEAL!"}
{"text":"First time here, saw a sign off the freeway for Gold Coast buffet. I am so glad we came. The Sunday brunch was $10.99, it was worth it. Stayed at The Mirage and they wanted $70 for a champaign buffet for 2. The pozole was delicious!! I think the best I've ever had. They had a great selection and everything taste good.   I will defiantly be back and will recommend this Buffet.   Leaving Vegas happy and satisfied :)"}
{"text":"When I arrived in Vegas I was so hungry that I couldn't think straight, so I went to the nearest buffet, which was Port o Call buffet for their Sunday brunch. I was originally excited to try several major buffets during my stay in Vegas but this place completely ruined my excitement for buffets in general.   It was around 2pm, the food was dry, presentation simple and crappy, the marinated steaks was dry and taste like soy sauce. All of the selections in the Asian section looked absolutely nasty and dry. All of the food here is well below standards. I paid $18 for this buffet and If I'd known ahead, I would not have paid more than $5. I cannot believe people even ate here, especially their card members..."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely a diamond in the rough. If you're looking to get a lot of food for a great price this is definitely the place you need to go. Its located just off the strip right across the street from the palms and Rio . The hotel is called gold coast. The buffet is in the back left portion of the casino. The only knock against this casino is that when you go in you may end up leaving with cancer because this smell of smoke is absolutely ridiculous. The average age of the people that come here I think is about 85 years old. But me personally I don't mind being around a bunch of old farts to get a lot of food for a really cheap price .   So come on down and check them out they have a large selection of styles of food and I guarantee you you will leave with your belly full."}
{"text":"Ports O Call is a great value just off the strip.  We took the bus there, and it was pretty convenient to reach.  We did the lunch buffet, which was less than $10.  The food was quite good, especially for the price.  Granted, it's not a five star restaurant, but for $10, you get an above average buffet with a great variety and a pretty good selection.  Not everything looked appetizing to me personally, but there is food for every taste.  Even the sushi was pretty good, and the dessert selection is very, very good.  Go!  you'll certainly get good value for your money."}
{"text":"I live in Las Vegas and have eaten at this Buffet several times and found it satisfactory, but I recently received a coupon for 1/2 off the buffet.  The buffet was advertised as $9.99.  I drove across town and presented my coupon only to be told that by using the coupon, the 1/2 off would be deducted from the $14.99, the original cost of the buffet.  I was told that if I didn't use the coupon, I would pay, $9.99.  With tax and using the coupon, the meal was $8.76 even though they advertised it as 1/2 off.  I think this was a trick and deceiving.  I complained to the cashier and she agreed but said there was nothing she could do, she had been informed by the manager to charge the higher price.  I said I felt this was wrong and a type of false advertising and would not eat at Gold Coast Casino again.  If the casino wants to give a discount, it should be what it says it is and not deceive the customer.    I did enjoy the crab legs.  The prime rib was flavorful.  All in all, the buffet was  good and I would eat there again.....with or without a coupon."}
{"text":"I've been coming to the buffet for years now, at least once a week, might skip a week occasionally.  Going downhill, no doubt about it, this past month, scraping the bottom.  I like the breakfast buffet, yesterday (2nd time this has happened), I get to my table with my plate, no waitress came by, ate my meal then finally got up and had to interrupt 2 waitresses, and the person who seats you from there joyful conversation to get something to drink, guessing their conversation was too interesting to do the job they were hired for.    No it was no busy, even made a comment to the cashier, she said the rush hasn't hit yet, plus as far as I can narrow it down, there were only 2 other tables occupied in my area."}
{"text":"Eeehh... It's a typical buffet . It's not the worst but not the best either. But if your hungry it will do . The food seems all pretty average. It reminds me more of hometown buffet kind of food. It's adequate. The severs are nice they fill up your drinks pretty good atleast :)"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good deal for breakfast, $7.99 PP They have an omelette station where you can get eggs cooked to order too.  I really enjoyed the little surprises like plantains with beans and sour cream.  There was fresh fruit, pancakes, waffles, French toast, chicken fried steak and four types of gravy.  The toast station was great too, good variety and self serve.  I would definitely come back for the  breakfast deal.  Oh and it's a dollar less with a players card."}
{"text":"Better than one might expect. No rare beef but good flavor and nice dessert selection for lunch. No sugar added choices many ice creams etc.  The Mongolian station is worth the trip, plenty of beef in my quick-fixed beef and vegetables.  Usually if you check the Internet, a two 4 1 coupon can be found."}
{"text":"The variety is decent along with a reasonable price but I got that uncomfortable buffet stomach after sampling a handful of dishes. The flavor was no better than average. The salad bar was decent and I wished I had focused on that. Enjoyed the cobbler & self serve yogurt or ice cream I had. Had a coupon for a beer or glass of wine & the unpleasant waiter couldn't comprehend that I wanted a water or juice also. Stayed at the casino for 3 nights for my daughters cheer competition but there is no chance we would have gone back to the buffet."}
{"text":"this place sucks dude!! how can anyone give this place 5 stars? have you no taste buds?!  seriously, everything here is so BLAND. except for the meats, which ironically is too salty. do yourself a favor and spend a few more bucks and eat at bistro @ palms next door."}
{"text":"Just average for a buffet.  The fight at the other table did make the meal more interesting! Now back to the food, it was Seafood Night.  If you are a seafood lover i think this is a pass, but if you just want something to satisfy the crave, its worth going.  Fair price for the food."}
{"text":"The food was very bland. They have a decent selection but just no flavor. The best thing I tasted was the Chinese BBQ pork but half was fat. Is it just me but there are no decent buffets any more. I don't think they know what salt is! They did have some trout and some tilapia that was pretty tasty but the rest was bland.   They do have a very tasty ice cream selection that included spumoni and coffee ice cream and they had these little maple \"fingers\" that I have never seen before but everyone in our group thought that they were amazing. If anyone knows what they are called, please let me know. Again, they were very damn good!"}
{"text":"Way better than I expected , and I expected little to none. Waitress Linda was VERY nice. Ice cream is delicious, Mongolian bbq is very good to! Love it here!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am not a fan of buffets. The only reason we actually came here is because it was in the hotel where we were staying and didn't feel like going out as we had been traveling all day. The other reason is due to the special price they were running for the month of July. $13.99 for prime rib dinner buffet!! That is ridiculous. The salad bar was adequate. To be honest though, nothing else on the entire buffet looked good to me. Sushi, Italian, Mexican, etc. They also have a sort of Mongolian grill type setup where you can pick your veggies/ingredients and they will fix it for you fresh. I had the prime rib which was really good and the Mac and cheese which was fine. I didn't really check out the dessert bar so I can't comment there. Everyone we encountered here though from the hostess, to the server, and even the cooks were so friendly and helpful. They really made the buffet experience tolerable. So if you like buffets I would recommend you give this one a try especially if they are running a special. You also get a discount when you show your B Connected card."}
{"text":"Good buffet and had a decent amount of food choices for $8.99 for lunch.  Food was not great but it was just the normal chow mein you would get at a chinese restaurant.  Their sausage was REALLY good. I was also surprised that they had german chocolate cake in the desserts section.  All in all, this place is just mediocre. I would definitely come back here for a $9 AYCE lunch just because it's cheap but not worth it for any more than that!"}
{"text":"Not a bad buffet, but not good either. I suppose it's worth it's $12.99 price, but definitely not anymore. We came for Sunday brunch.  You could tell a lot of the food had been sitting out for a long while.   They had different sections to choose from: Mexican, American, Seafood, etc...  I loaded my plate but only took a couple bites of everything, except for the breakfast burrito. That was pretty delicious.  It was just an okay experience."}
{"text":"I used to go here often but with better choices available, I haven't been there recently.  We went here this evening.  The food is OK.  There are no real standouts.  Like other buffets, the variety of food has been cut back.  This was very noticeable at the salad bar.  Much of it was ice with many fewer bowls spread over the area.  I was going to get some jambalaya as I had in the past, but it looked liked there were cubes of processed ham instead of the sausage they used to have.  I skipped this dish.  I did get some salt and pepper fried oysters.  They were very tasty, but the breading was quite think and soft--a problem with some buffet food items.  They did have some nice vegetables--cauliflower in a cheese sauce (a little watery) and brussel sprouts with pieces of cooked bacon.    A summary would be that the buffet is OK.  The food is very standard cafeteria type with nothing really outstanding.  I think the lunch buffet is a better value."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Our server was very nice. They have many options. We had a nice time dinning here, although I'm not crazy about buffets."}
{"text":"Really a 3.5 for food, but I wanna balance out the out-of-perspective reviews.Nothing out of the ordinary here. Breakfast is way better and less greasy than you can get at Denny's. This is NOT the Wynn, people! There's more value, healthy, and hearty choices here than a McD's \"value meal\". Courteous service and cleanliness will have me coming back if I ever \"have\" to stay at Gold Coast."}
{"text":"I went to this place yesterday. It was really close to my hotel(Rio), the price for dinner was good. Foods was ok, dessert was great but there was a waitress middle age with black hair and glasses she was really rude! I have never ever seen something like this before! I was speaking with her and she rolled her eyes and went! When I asked her for tea she was angry! She was rude when she we asked for something she threw spoon on the table! Never recommend never come back again!"}
{"text":"Friday night seafood................  all you can eat crab.  Yummy.  The selection was wonderful.  It was all really good."}
{"text":"Worst buffet i've ever been to. Had many choices - chinese, italian, american, etc ...and they were all terrible - flavorless and tasteless. Complete waste of money!"}
{"text":"I've been to mega buffets, and this one was just mediocre. I appreciate the price point of 16.99, but this goes to show that you get what you pay for. It was just your average, every day, Golden Coral/Cactus Willie's style buffet.  On Sundays, there is brunch and endless mimosas from 8-3 pm. Sounds good, right? Until you taste it... It's just average. I had a few sips of a regular and peach mimosa and I was done. I had the breakfast foods, which were actually not bad. Pancakes, French toast, eggs, bacon and fruit (watermelon, cantaloupe and honeydew). I tried to mix in some other foods, but they didn't sit well with my pallet.  There was a good variety of foods, and the food area is well kept by the servers. Speaking of servers, the waiter who was helping us left a lot of plates on our table for long periods. It wasn't crowded today, so I'm not exactly sure what he was doing. My husband and I ended up clearing the table ourselves."}
{"text":"Steak buffet in the middle of the week?  Heck yes!  Being that it is Vegas, and there are better buffets, this one is priced very, very well!  Also since it is Vegas, I don't recall whether the steak buffet fell on a Wednesday or a Thursday, but eating that much rib-eye sure helped the hangover :-)  On a more serious note, the service was great, and the selection was broad!  There were also two stations set up:  one for the made to order steaks and one for stir-fry Chinese food.  I must also add that the dessert bar is better than what you expect from most buffets as there is a great number of deserts to choose from; that is if you didn't eat too much steak!"}
{"text":"Holy moly.  I paid $8.39 for lunch here on day.  The food here is average,  but when you look at the price it is totally worth a stop in.  The Supreme Pizza was delicious, and I judge all buffets by their pizza.  The best food in the whole placed was fried cheese ravioli.  I went back for thirds and fourths.  The fried catfish was delicious as well.  Some of the food was lukewarm and the selection was mediocre, but for $8.39 (total after tax), I won't complain at all.  Does it compare to the Bellagio, Wynn or Spice Market Buffets?  No, but for $8.39 it's in a good category on its own."}
{"text":"We (my fianceé and I) went to the breakfast buffet on 11/25/2016 while on vacation. All of the food, aside from omelettes made to order and oatmeal were ice cold. It was cold to the point where all we could do was eat some fruit pick at our disgustingly cold plates. We barely touched our food and politely asked to speak to a supervisor for a refund as we barely got to eat due to their food being so cold and inedible. The supervisor - whoever was the supervisor as of 11/25/2016 - was immediately condescending, ripped our receipt from our hands, checked her watch and said: \"well you ate - why would I give you a refund.\" This was before we explained the concern - that we didn't eat due to the food being cold. She then, condescendingly, said, \"why didn't you complain to the servers\" - we let her know that we were not approached by servers and that we actually didn't eat because of the food quality. She continued to be rude, condescending, and talk over us or shake her head while we tried to very politely explain our issue. And then she just walked away without a word or resolution. We are filing a formal complaint against her and the Ports O' Call Buffet as soon as possible as we are able. This is unacceptable service and the food - most of which was entirely cold - was not up to health code. Please don't eat here - for the sake of your health and to avoid condescending treatment if there is an issue with your meal."}
{"text":"I'd like to consider myself something of a food adventurer. I'm always willing to try a shady-looking hole-in-the-wall if for no other reason than the experience of eating in such a place. On our way out of LV, I suggested we try some cheap-ass buffet for breakfast. Who knows, maybe it could be awesome? We decided on the Gold Coast's $5.99 special.   We made a horrible mistake.   Nothing here was edible. At all. I piled a plate full of whatever slop they had served up, and I think the only thing I managed to scarf down was a spoonful of eggs and half a strip of bacon. I tried a cheese blintze but had to spit it up before I puked. This place is death. The food looked as old and moldy as the clientele who play here.   Nothing could sum up a meal here better than the tray of apple crepes they had, which were labeled as \"Apple Crapes\"."}
{"text":"This is possibly the worst buffet I have ever experienced.   The quality of the food is sub par.  The biscuits were so hard you could break a tooth.  They have several stations but don't expect anything edible unless you are used to bad cooking.  How could Boyd Gaming allow this to happen? Their buffet at the Orleans is quite nice.   Save your money.  The only thing palatable is the fruit and oatmeal; just barely."}
{"text":"It's a 10 dollar buffet.  Please don't get the seafood (unless its crab legs)  Mongolian sections as actually really good, so was the full Salad bar.  Pizza was bland and other Italian specialties blander...but it's a 10 dollar buffet.  Desserts were legit, ice cream was awesome and yes they do have signs now despite some previous reviews.  Bread Pudding was off the heezy.  I was in town for Phish and on a food budget so I was gorging once a day and monetarily worth it.  Some of these food critics need a dose of reality next time they all into a $10 dollar buffet..."}
{"text":"In comparison to Rio's Worlds buffet, taste, selection and atmosphere, Rio wins.  But price supersedes all that, this breakfast  buffet was $5.99!"}
{"text":"With such low prices how can anybody be disappointed? I like a place that isn't so expensive you have to feel as if you need to take \"all you can eat\" as a personal challenge to get your moneys worth. These days at most places coffee is $3 and a dessert is $6 anywhere you go. So just imagine you can walk in here for lunch have coffee and dessert and everything else is as good as free.  The space has large open areas and a nice ambiance especially because of the high ceilings. If you really want to save a buck go and get the players card. Its sort of a long walk and a wait in line to get it. Honestly not worth the 20 minutes it would take to save $1... but if you are a coupon person you might be so used to spending hours to save a dollar or two and you might enjoy the satisfaction of saving a buck so much its worth the time."}
{"text":"Breakfast Buffet $5.99  One of the CHEAPEST left in Las Vegas  Good Selection @ 50 items  Nothing spectacular-(((ie. . Don't expect gourmet )))       Like Rick H. stated .. this buffet is heavy and might leave you feeling a bit ill.  Dessert  and good coffee is all the rave here!!.  Stating the Obvious here-You Get What You Pay For!:)"}
{"text":"This was really quite horrible... you kind of expect a certain standard of food in a Las Vegas buffet... the price is right... but the food was disgustingly substandard... I literally almost threw up eating the crawfish and also the sour Boston chowder..."}
{"text":"ho hom,,average tasting food, but right for the price,,im mad they used to have fried oysters and fresh shimp for lunch,,both of which is gone"}
{"text":"You have to admit that a place of this size, with such a huge variety, is definitely worth the $10 for the lunch buffet. There are even many varieties of salads if you are a grains and roughage eater.  They break the cuisines into multiple food categories.  For my lunch day, the categories were Seafood, Magnolia, Chinese, barbecue American, Mexican, Italian and desserts. Within those different sections you also have specific salad varieties from that particular area. They even have an entire salad bar set on an island by itself was also fruit and soup included. The dessert bar has a variety of pre-sliced entities as well as fruit cobbler and bread pudding. They also have sugar-free desserts and gluten-free desserts. You can also ask them to give you a slice of dessert from out of the display case. If you are looking for gelato or ice cream, they have you covered on both ends. They also have ice cream cones and dessert toppings such as sprinkles and chocolate syrup.  If you are wondering if the food itself will blow you away, then that is truly on you and your taste buds.  One thing that I like about this place is that you cannot deny the value and variety offered.   If you get a \"B Connected\" card, which is free, you can get a discount on your buffet (normally a dollar off)."}
{"text":"For the price (2 for 1 or discounted rate ~$8 per person with coupon or casino card), this is a decent place for an ordinary Sunday Brunch.   Speciality:  Chinese food is very good and authentic.  Variety of desserts (My favorite is the chocolate cake with a hint of chocolate ice cream. I like it because it is not too sweet at all.)  Sucks:  Italian - The pizza is overloaded with cheese and the other ingredient is tasteless.  Other selections:  Mexican  American BBQ - Roasted beef is pretty good  Seafood   Services:  Most of the servers are more mature. I loved their warm and sincere smiles and services. Not like those stone/rubber faces at the fancy buffet lines.   Note:  I will try their dinner buffet next time. Believe it or not, Ports O Call is one of the top 10 buffet in Las Vegas according to govegas.com."}
{"text":"For starters, CASHIER AND HOST SERVICE SUCKS!!! We came for breakfast on a friday not knowin that they pick up the breakfast food at 1030. It was 910 wen we got to the cashier and payed for our entrance. Cashier's attitude was one of the worst I've ever experienced. (and ive worked in food industry) She never smiled, she never greeted, she ignored the questions my husband was asking her and just told us ok here's your change walk forward to be seated. By this time it's probably 915 920am. The host, same thing, did not greet and did not smile, was just talking on her lil headset. 930....940....950....still not seated. We started complaining to the host and she had the nerve to say I think you should just go. Your time is limited and we can't sit you yet.  wow! Speechless! Got our money back and left. My husband was set on making his way to a buffet before we left Vegas so here we go again. Trying to give this buffet the benefit of the doubt we tried again. The host from friday was now the cashier. Same attitude, same face,  same ignorance. She charged is $10.99 for a child who is 3 yrs old who eats a tablespoon or two. Wtf! whatever. I can pay my sh***. So we didnt let it ruin on brunch. Once I got inside...omg I wanted to ask for my money back!! Waiter was nice decent service and we all had a drink at all times but the food was horrible!!! Alfredo sauce tasted like water. Menudo tasted days old. Gravy was super salty. Fried chicken tasted like plastic. Pizza was mediocre. Watermelon wasnt sweet. Everything about this place is just wrong. My husband was so upset and he apologized for takin us to such a horrible place. I honestly had 2 bagels with cream cheese because that was the only thing they couldnt mess up. 3 yr old child had 2 spoonfuls of cereal. Lol this place is a dump. Then again you get wat u pay for. Never again will I visit this buffet. They need to hire friendly staff to keep their customers coming back and they most definitely need new cooks!!!! If there was an option for zero stars that's what they'd get from me. Mind you, I hate posting bad reviews but this one was a must."}
{"text":"This was probably the worse buffet I've been to in Las Vegas, especially for over $10. I came here with a couple coworkers since we had a training seminar at the Gold Coast. We saved a couple of bucks by signing up for the B-connected card, but honestly this place should be worth $5 for the quality of food you get.  To start the salad bar was super small and the options included one type of lettuce, iceberg.. my favorite. There also was not a ton of non-meat, vegetarian options besides cheese pizza, pasta and veggie spring rolls. The dessert were a small selection as well, nothing look too appetizing.   I can't say I'd ever come back here again. Not my cup of tea at all."}
{"text":"The buffet had a nice variety of food, but nothing in it was really that amazing. It was kind of just a lot of regular food, like Home Town Buffet in a way. I was impressed with the desserts, though. There was a HUGE variety of cakes, cream pies, ice cream, etc. The only problem was that they weren't labeled, so I had to keep asking the dessert lady what each thing was, and it was a bit hard to understand her because of her accent.   Service was good. They were quick to take away plates we were done with and give us drink refills.  The prices can be a little insane. I think if you go on a weekday lunch, it's a pretty good price, maybe $8 or $9, but a Friday dinner (seafood night) is $30, which is WAYYYYYY overpriced, especially if you weren't really planning on getting any seafood."}
{"text":"I've only done the breakfast buffet..but let me tell you...You cannot go wrong here! $5.99 for a buffet breakfast! It's decent food (don't expect gourmet) and you can get in and out on most days under 45 minutes unless you're a BIG eater. So if you're trying to get a quick bite to eat, and you are on a budget, (even if you're not)  definitely do come here. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday Brunch. I love this buffet. Was happy to see that nothing has changed, and the food was as remembered. I didn't love the chicken parm, but I did love the donuts! Have been coming here for years, and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"This is one of the best buffet in town for us locals! Food is great, prices very affordable but our server JANICE, kept ignoring us in spite of my calling her and trying to catch her attention by saying excuse me and hello. She just passes by our table and takes care of nearby guests at nearby tables but continues to pass our table and ignores us. She keeps refilling coffee and sodas at other nearby tables except ours not even stopping to ask us if we need anything. At least when we called the attention of the buffet supervisor Patricia, she gave us a pot of coffee and helped to call the attention of our server for additional orange juice and iced tea. Thanks to Ms. Patricia for saving the awful service that we experienced today!"}
{"text":"We decided to eat hear on a couple of occasions during our stay in Vegas at the Rio Hotel. The food was ok. It wasn't the worst I have ever had and it certainly wasn't the best. It was just ok. In terms of price, it was reasonable and definitely more affordable than the buffet at the Rio. So if your are staying at the Rio and want a reasonably priced and decent buffet, try the Ports O' Call Buffet at the Gold Coast Hotel & Casino, right across the street from the Rio."}
{"text":"Our breakfast buffet was disappointing on a number of levels including the absence of ripe fruit plus neither the Chinese or Italian stations were open.  My huevos rancheros suffered from stale tortillas and overcooked eggs."}
{"text":"Weeknight 'prime rib' buffet   Not someplace I would recommend but if you have points and can eat for free off your points, it works. No-frills extremely casual never very busy buffet. Do not expect to be wowed with any gourmet items or 'real' seafood (crawfish and inexpensive fish). The salad bar was decent - fresh greens and enough fixings to make a good salad. The prime rib was okay. The desserts were the highlight and loved that you could get 'fresh' slices out of the display case vs. pre-sliced dried out pieces on plates like most buffets. Tried the german chocolate, regular chocolate, chocolate mousse, and carrot cakes and they were all solid. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Did not thoroughly disappoint... after reading other reviews.  The Prime Rib was \"magical\" like David Copperfield cooked it.  Walking from the carving station to my table, I watched my prime rib turn from a reddish pink color to a dull grey before my very eyes!  It was like eating leather.  I watched other people \"fighting\" with their meat trying to cut it as well.  mBoth the rice pilaf and Mashed potatoes and gravy were a bit bland and the little flavor it did have was kind of funny tasting.  Yuk.  Other items that were not very good were the entire Chinese and Italian stations (including their artichoke hearts and olive section).  I did not try dessert.  Now for the good stuff.  I did enjoy the Mexican station (surprisingly as I am from California and am a bit picky) because they had \"build your own\" sopes (i.e. Shell, pork pozole, beans, Mexican cheese, lettuce, pico de gallo, cilantro, lemon and salsa verde.  I ate two of those.  The guacamole was sour though.  I also liked their gumbo which I poured over white rice (had a couple servings of that as well).  Their sword fish was not too bad either.  The BBQ pork ribs were seasoned nicely with the dry rub and didn't really need sauce.  Since I got $10 off for being a hotel guest, I give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"I'm not hoity-toity, but for the price it was decent. Not much options and most weren't that great tasting. There were a few items that were good.  Decent option for the price."}
{"text":"Good buffet for the price.   Staff was friendly.   Was there late at night around 9pm so the did run out of some items and some items were not as fresh but that is to be expected at the end of the day."}
{"text":"Clean good and many choices of food to chose from.  The price is what brought us in and I am glad we came by.   I would visit this buffet again while in Vegas.  The parking was easy not too far outside the casino doors.   My son loved that the had everything to make your own hamburgers!  I was sorry that we didn't get there early enough to have breakfast :("}
{"text":"Best value for your money ...in vegas..for buffet...worth  a. Drive ......  All.. buffet....vegas.....in breakfast....that i try.  Gold coast  buffet vegas  is one of the best...In..all buffet .. breakfast..."}
{"text":"This place is ok. The rice is way different from the rice that I'm used to eating back in Hawaii. The rice was like super dry and I was like \"nope, this rice sucks\" lol. I ended up eating mash potato which was alright. They had different stations from seafood, Mexican, Mediterranean (I think) and like 3 other stations plus a dessert and salad bar station. The pies/cakes were ok here. One of the chocolate cakes that I got was dry! Like if I touched the icing it was dry & the cake itself, was not moist. One of the soup that I had was good but a little salty. The baked chicken was delicious though! It is a must try. Also, the crawfish was a favorite for my family  they got like three or four rounds of it. The wait wasn't long when we went but the workers were very friendly."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, figured that it was time for a review of the buffet.  Let's cut to the chase: The food is average. Nothing too exceedingly fancy, but better than mystery meat swimming in gravy. Breakfast offerings usually include waffles, french toast, made-to-order omelettes, and various styles of breakfast meats and potatoes. Lunch and dinner are pretty much the same, with basic fried seafood, pizza, chinese food (which is pretty tasty), with some nights offering crab legs and steaks for a slightly higher price.  The wait staff is generally nice and attentive.  The price really can't be beat. As long as you have a player's card, breakfast lunch and dinner are 6-9-12 dollars, respectively. Compared to other buffet offerings, I'm not sure where else you can get a decent breakfast or lunch for under $10.  In review: It's inexpensive, it's basic."}
{"text":"Move along, not much to see here. Typical buffet fare, not much selection. Mostly decent on the regular stuff (salad, soups, Mexican).  We came for the bowling, but the rest of our party was held up, so we hit the All You Can Steak Thursday special. Wasn't expecting much of AYCE steak from a buffet - and yet I was still very disappointed. They make them to order, which means that you wait in line to ask for rare to get a medium-well, because that's they only way they know how to cook them. Not sure what cut these were, but I'm assuming maybe the ear or pancreas because I've had more tender shoe leather. Seriously, I literally BENT THE STEAK KNIFE trying to cut off a piece. After the second bite, my jaw was so sore I gave up.  The best part of the entire meal was the succulent honeydew melons. The ice cream wasn't even that good.  The service was swift and courteous. The Filipino man that took our plates away and brought us napkins and drinks was a sweetie with a big smile. He even conspired with me to sneak the inedible leftover steak out for my dog.  They got stars because they were saved by good service."}
{"text":"This buffet located inside the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino, is one of the cheapest and most decent buffets in all of Vegas, though it is off The Strip. I ate here for breakfast and it costs under $10. It's nothing super duper fancy, but it should fill all of your needs and basic requirements. Especially, for that first meal of the day! If you're not too hoity-toity and you're just looking for a good, cheap, filling meal with lots of options, especially for young families, then this is the place! Service is fast and friendly, too!"}
{"text":"Alright ladies, and gents this review is an honest, and neutral review. In no way,shape, or form am I intentionally giving this Buffet a bad review for any reason other than I'm giving my personal opinion regarding the experience that I had today dining there, and tasting the food that was being served.  I had been to Port of Call Buffet at the Gold Coast before and I do remember that the food was not the best I've had but it wasn't the worst either, and that is why I decided to go and eat there today.   The entry at the buffet with your players card will cost you roughly $9, and to be honest the quality of the food fits that price just right. Once I went into the buffet and took a look at the variety of food that was available, I was very disappointed as they didn't have a good  variety, and the quality of food which was presented did not look that appealing as some of the food looked rather dry, and not too appetizing.  Nevertheless I went for a couple of items went back to my table sat down and gave it a chance. Yikes, the first item I tasted where the mashed potatoes, I  have to say they were very disappointing they did not have good flavor. Another item on my plate we're enchiladas to be honest I had trouble finishing them.  I could go on and on and talk about every single item that I tasted there that was disappointing but if I did this review would be extremely long. One of  the items that disappointed me the most was the pasta. It was dry, and tasted like it was sitting there for a very long time.   None of the food that I had at the buffet was good. Even the desert was bad if you can believe that. I had some bread pudding and the taste was just not what you expect.  The only thing that was good at that Buffet was the service. The gal that was picking up plates and bringing me refreshments was very respectful, very nice and kept my cup full. This is the only reason they're getting two stars because of the service,because if that was bad they might have just gotten one star. So in summary it doesn't appear I will be going back to this buffet for a very long time."}
{"text":"Good food and cheap.  Alway full with a lot of variety.  Love the pie display. Have been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and have never been disappointed.  Love that beverages are included too!"}
{"text":"Would recommend anywhere else for your meal other than this buffet.  My friend ate here twice and was very sick and I didn't feel that great.  If you feel compelled to eat here, I would suggest breakfast as most everything is prepared fresh and, with a player's card, $1.00 of price."}
{"text":"My brother read a review on yahoo that there is a hidden gem in the buffet world in las vegas so we decided to try this buffet because apparently you can get lobster and all other wonderful highline food for $9.99. Guess what. In your dream.  Not only the food selection are limited and they dont even know how to cook a simple chowmein. They actually charge $12.99 for lunch on sunday. I should've known better since I live in las vegas. But again, another restaurant that I tried and shot down.   One and done for me."}
{"text":"Lots of options, clean, and cheap.   Brightly lit.  Moths would love it. It's a buffet- don't expect great service. Just shut up and eat, you little piggies."}
{"text":"Mediocre food at best, but here is the deal breaker - they charged full adult price for the 8 and 11 year old children we had with us. Pizza slices and soft serve ice cream for $16.99 each! What a deal! If no stars was a choice, this place would get it. I miss the old Vegas...."}
{"text":"I don't usually go to too many buffet,as it is just to much food, or food that is ok to eat,,and this was almost free(friday nite seafood buffet).. And the food was about average to say the least the, salmon fish was dry, the fresh oyster look and taste like putty,as I found the best way to get good oysters is to have them shucked right be before you devour them? The top sirloin was tough... The best items on the menu was the huge piece of taramisu and most things on the dessert menu was tasty.. I see why there was not too much people waiting in line the food was just ok. The staff was great and helpful-- 5 stars for the staff,  and  2 1/2 stars for the food.."}
{"text":"This buffet is pretty smaller than the usual buffets on the main strip. They have specials each day and prices for the buffet are different on weekdays than on weekends (because they offer more items such as crab legs on the menu). Sadly, they do have select days that they will have crab legs on the menu unlike other buffets, they'd have crab legs every night.   I have a players card and I usually go here to redeem coupons and points. Their lines could get pretty long because people usually already wait 15 to 30 minutes prior before the buffet opening. You pay in advance and seated where your server will come to take your drink order. From there you are free to get your food. There is one line filled with food, a middle section filled with another set of food, and to the side the dessert section. It's pretty small and it does not have as much selection but I believe they always have at least one dish that is the utmost delicious. They have the basic American food and as you go down the line there is a mix of ethnic selections. The middle section holds your typical salad bar and in the corner section there's the ice cream machine and bakery items to chose from. It's an affordable buffet and I recommend going on a Sunday to get their seafood menu + steak!"}
{"text":"Worst food ever. $25 for Easter brunch buffet and I have much better food at a truckstop buffet. Asked for a pc of chocolate pie and got lemon. The the guy said he speak no English.  Manager was no help eaither. She sent some other guy over to the table and when he approached us he just said \"Yes?\" I told him to go away he was no Manager and if he was he shouldn't be. Food was not fresh and was poorly made with cheap meats ."}
{"text":"This is of the best bargains in Las Vegas.  $15 for the dinner buffet, lots of choices, pretty good food.  All you can eat!  Now my rich foodie friends from LA would probably turn up their nose at this place, but if you like decent comfort food, there is plenty of it here at a great price.  I piled my plate with salisbury steak, a big taquito, some pasta, a little salad, and I forget what else.  All pretty good, completely satisfying.  Then -- two desserts!  Both delish!  Then off to the nearby Rio to see Penn & Teller.  A great night all around."}
{"text":"Read everywhere how this was the buffet for locals bc it was cheap and good. I got fooled. It was cheap but very bland and their selection wasn't the best. I would spend more money and go someplace else."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Took FOREVER for the wait staff to get to us, and then they never came back. I couldn't even find a server. Had to go get the manager who was ALSO hard to find. The food wasn't anything to write home about., and normally, I don't care. I go for the bargain, but I'd just rather get food anywhere else. Palace Station has a comparable food for the same price, and their service is much better. Never coming here again. i think the only reason people still go is because they get comped."}
{"text":"Iono if it's holidays price or what.. But we pay $28.00 for 2, during brunch.. The price outside said $9 per person.. Im on vacation, so I didn't care.. My first mistake..   Then come the the food.. It just terribad...    - shrimp cocktail (unpealed) look like it's been sitting there for hours.. Some of the shrimp were black.. Their sauce was w/e..  -fried oyster was just bad, it was hard and chewy.. -sausages, after I chew it and had to spit it out.. Cuz it taste like it's been sitting there all day and I happen to picked it..  -sushi rolls, I saw new one coming out, so I got some to try.. Iono if it was pre-made from 2 night ago or what but the rice was hard, and everything was just bad combined..  -spaghetti.. Iono how you can go wrong with spaghetti.. But it was actually bad.. The noodle wasn't fully cooked, and the sauce taste like it's reused from last night..   All the chef looked so miserable except the omlet guy,  he was cheerful...   At one point, me and my gf was looked at each other and laugh, cuz we both agreed that the food was just bad, but couldn't talk about it cuz we feel it was rude..   The foods that was decent are their fruits (cuz it's just sliced fruit) and cereal, and bacon (Thank God they didn't mess this up) ...    Maybe it was just their bad day, but I dont know why this place got any decent review.. Please.. Don't do it.. Save your money and eat at 1000 of other places in vegas.."}
{"text":"The food wasn't phenomenal but it wasn't terrible either. Mediocre I guess is the best way to put it. The price is decent. Staff is friendly, and we didn't wait long to pay then be seated. The Mexican/Italian station was okay. Everything else I didn't care for. The dessert was decent too."}
{"text":"C'MON!!!! look at their prices!   We checked out this place once again. Actually, twice. Came by for breakfast... around $6. you can't even get most breakfast combos at McDonald's for that price. yeah, it's not the greatest, but, it's $6! and you have a multitude of options. if you want an egg mcmuffin, coffee and a hashbrown, then knock yourselves out. but, if you want ok to not too shabby eggs, bacon, sausage, menudo, chorizo, buscuits, gravy, chicken fried steak, corn beef hash etc etc ET freaking CETERA!!!! ALL FOR $6! oh, and OJ, coffee, soda too.   We were lucky enough to also make it to thursday 7steak nite. two words for you... AWE... SOME! the carving station has made to order NYs. they also had prime rib, and a bunch of other steak medley items. irish stew, some mexican thing... honestly, i was kinda drunk for dinner already so i don't remember much. i do remember keeping it all down though. ALL FOR $14!!!!   anyway, get yourselves a card and get these deals. the place is clean, the staff are friendly and attentive. and the prices CAN NOT be beat!"}
{"text":"i wouldn't say i had a bad meal here, but i definitely wouldn't go back. i did like the price. we were staying right next to the strip and every buffet in those casinos was at least $20 a person minimum. this one was about 15 a person and a very short drive from our hotel. i also liked the fact that they had food from 6 or so different countries. the service was also attentive. the reason i gave it such a low rating though was that the food was not very good. everything was extremely bland. the only things i genuinely enjoyed were the catfish, cheese enchilada, and soft-serve ice cream. but i can't complain too much as we did leave stuffed because we were determined to try as much as possible!"}
{"text":"Came here for the prices , make sure you get the players card to get a better deal! Not much of a selection , but what they have is decent . You definitely get your monies worth ."}
{"text":"Staying at this casino. So having previous positive experience here I did return and will continue to return. I don't need much to satisfy a great review of a buffet! This place consistently puts out good quality food at a great price! The service from Arleen was warm and genuine. She definitely made the experience a great one. They had a lot to choose from all the way from multiple breads for toast, to eggs made to order including omelettes! Pancakes, waffles and so much bacon. Biscuits and gravy with 3 different gravy options. Fruits and grits, oatmeal, cream of wheat, cold cereals, danishes, breakfast burritos, sausage and really a lot I probably missed. It's hard to beat a sub $10 breakfast buffet in Las Vegas! And the Sunday brunch buffets with mimosa's!!! They mastered the good quality at affordable prices. Thank you for providing a great experience. I will return! Respectfully, Bryan Oklahoma City"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for in Vegas. For $6.95 each, Michelle and I got a breakfast buffet. The price of this buffet is cheaper than going and sitting down and getting ONE breakfast at the Friday's in the casino.  The food was all mediocre, and some of it was undercooked. They had the usual breakfast fare: bacon, eggs, sausage (links and patties), hash browns, home fires, breakfast burritos, an omelet station, fruit, etc. They also had the dessert section open with donuts and pastries and peach cobbler (which was overcooked). Overall, it is a great value and is a good way to fill up before heading back to Long Beach, CA :) Just don't expect great food."}
{"text":"This place is worse than Home Town Buffet by 3 notches. I kid you not. Nothing was fresh and everything was just overly salty or bland."}
{"text":"This buffet in Las Vegas is the BEST!! They have your every desire, Italian, Mexican, Bar-B-Que, Seafood; just everything you want; prices is the best in town. Come to this buffet whenever your in Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Assume for a moment there are 200 restaurants in Las Vegas that offer buffets -- then I would rate Ports O' Call 201. The dining area is fine. The food stations are neat and tidy, but the food selections are atrocious (seafood practically non-existent). The dishes offered are from poor to mediocre at best. The food & beverage director at the Goldcoast is clueless. I wouldn't even give this food away."}
{"text":"Arrived 7/15, 1145am this time it Lunch until 3pm. Cost $8.99 per person. There was 4 of us total was $38.48. They ask how many in your party before you are seated. Our server was Janice middle aged African American lady. Very sweet. Food selection was good American, Italian, Mexican and Chinese. I only took a couple of pics the crowd started get bigger so a bit hard to take pics. But I started in the Chinese area. They also had make you own hamburger. Meat lasagna, breaded raviolis. Also they had soups, salad bar, fruit bar. They can also a stir fry veggies and also Mongolian. The dessert areas good too cakes, loafs, soft serve ice cream, and like 10 other varieties of scooped ice cream that the servers behind the stations do. For this price can't beat a good meal."}
{"text":"Imagine your neighborhood Hometown Buffet or some variation of that.  Now, imagine that place on steroids but with lower prices and a larger variety of foods, with better taste and quality on average.  That, my friend, is Ports O'Call Buffet. Considering the price I paid to eat here ($10 for lunch), I'm quite impressed. I particularly liked the \"Italian\" section. Everything was pretty much drenched in tomato sauce, alfredo sauce, cheese, or any combination of those. For cheap food, it was absolutely bomb. The other sections weren't as good as the \"Italian\" section, but considering the price I paid, I was pretty happy with the selection. The dessert section was actually pretty comprehensive, which was pretty surprising.  The food wasn't high quality. Not even close. But considering the low prices and the relatively good food, I'm raring to come back again."}
{"text":"This hotel should be called Old Folks Hotel not Gold Coast. Jokes aside, the buffet is what you would expect from a cheap buffet. It is better than your typical HTBF but I would not say much better. The food here is edible and doesn't mess you up and I think that merits a 3 star. Everyone eating in this joint is probably 60+ so the food is pretty much made for them. Come here if you need to get filled, don't want to spend a lot of money, or have bad teeth."}
{"text":"With buffets, you're always looking for the perfect balance between price and quality of food. You don't want to pay a lot for crappy food, obviously, but you're cool with eating something less than gourmet to save a few bucks. Overall, I think this one strikes a good balance. It's ridiculously cheap ($8 for lunch!), but the food is still pretty good. Maybe I lucked out the last time I went, but the food was freshly made and tasted good. It was definitely better than the 24 hour cafe at my hotel and I paid twice as much for food half as good.   Sure, it's off the strip, but you've gotta leave Vegas some time and this is a good stop on the way out. Gold Coast is a sort of sad little casino, something similar to what they had out there before the mega hotel/casinos the city's got now, but you lost all your money anyway. Forgive the extra cigarette smoke and abundance of little old ladies and check this place out. It definitely seems like the place the locals go to, so you know you're getting your money's worth twice over."}
{"text":"We visited here for the first time on Christmas Day, the staff was very nice and friendly, granted they had to work on a holiday. The place was not very filled but then by the time we left they were busy. The good was good also it was your regular buffet style food, they had the christmas dinner feast which was good. The waitress Kathleen, was very nice and friendly, she kept the table cleaned and drink filled. I also like how they have slips with the servers names so you can see who is waiting on your table. That helps when you cant remember the name of your waiter, waitress. The price was good also (just make sure you have a B Connected card) I will visit again this place was clean and friendly!"}
{"text":"I have only came here during lunch time and this buffet is totally worth the lunch price. I could eat their cocktail shrimp all day, end with a flourless chocolate cake slice and be satisfied. But of course, I have to have a little taste of everything.   I recommend anyone to eat at Ports O'Call Buffet. It is cheap, clean and good. I just have two tips to increase your chances of having an awesome experience.   1. Don't expect gourmet. 2. Save room for dessert because they have a vast selection."}
{"text":"You don't get what you pay for...you get less. Went here on a Friday night, crab legs were the only edible item. The food was so flavorless and bland, even though they appeared to put the same seasoning on everything from the ribs to the chicken legs. Service was okay, at least they kept our glasses filled. Dessert was definitely edible, but also just bland. I heard another person complaining to the staff about quality and their answer was \"You can't please everyone\"...so they're very well aware their shit stinks. Save your money and go literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"This buffet is located inside the Gold Coast Casino. Breakfast, lunch or dinner this place will keep you full. The selection isn't huge but more than enough, great quality and service as well!   It's always clean and the lines aren't too long. Not too expensive, remember to use your players card to get the discounted price. As a local I come here often, especially for their prime rib, crawfish and crab legs.. Deliciousness! For breakfast you can create your own omelette, as well for dinner your own stir fry!  Do NOT skip their dessert bar!  So many pies to choose from, but you MUST try their bread pudding (with a scoop of ice cream) You won't regret it! and let's not forget about their gelato bar.. mmm  If you can, ask to be seated in Juanita's section! She is amazing, great service and will take care of you.   Perfect place to eat like royalty on a budget :p"}
{"text":"The full price is not worth the quality and selection of food that they serve. We only go if we have a buy one get one free coupon that you can easily get on the receipt print outs at the Smith's on Decatur/flamingo, otherwise it would not be a good decision. We like the swai fish they usually have as they prepare it in a couple of different ways depending on the day. My favorite is the sweet and sour swai, mmmmm yum. Their bread pudding kicks ass in flavor!  They really need to revamp this buffet as the selection is limited and dull in flavor and execution. It could be so much better if they would make some changes with the food selection and preparation. The food I noticed was not even warm or hot, a lot of items were room temperature. The staff is friendly and is good at keeping the drink refills up at least. This is not a buffet that will keep me coming back, I am pretty much three and done, is not worth going for two likeable items in my opinion."}
{"text":"I got dragged here, I swear.  Those who know me know I would ordinarily never set foot in this cesspool of a place.  Anyway, it was a horrible, horrible experience that I hope to soon forget, but still have nightmares about.  Such disgusting, inebidle \"food\", I wouldn't even feed my dog here.  Stay away."}
{"text":"Only had their breakfast buffet, but it was definitely one of the best breakfast buffets I had! Price is great, under $7 for multiple choices! The only thing I dislike is how far from the strip it is if you don't rent a car. Probably not worth the cab fair. But non the less, if you can get here do it. We ate breakfast here easily 3 of the 5 mornings we were visiting."}
{"text":"The food was ok. It's one of the cheaper buffets in town, so you kind of get what you pay for. Pay the extra ten bucks and go to a nicer buffet!"}
