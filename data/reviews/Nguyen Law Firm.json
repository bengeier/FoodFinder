{"text":"I have nothing but good to say about Hanh Nguyen and his staff, Ling and Julia. I was severely injured in January in a bicycle accident, and the driver of the vehicle that had turned in front of me not only had no insurance but was driving on a suspended license. My wife and I got Hanh's name through a family friend, and retained him to attempt to get some compensation to cover some huge medical bills along with several months' lost wages.  He really worked on all aspects of the case, ranging from nudging me about hard-to-get medical records that were necessary for the case to helping my wife recover my belongings when I was too injured to leave the house. They were unfailingly polite, and their requests of us were carefully worded and always timely. We explored several approaches towards filing a claim, and they never let up until the case was done. Hanh knowledge of personal injury and vehicular law and procedures involved in recovery is really impressive. He is a tough negotiator, and he quickly reached a favorable settlement on the case, without us having to go to the extra expense of a trial.  I hope I never have to retain an attorney for personal injury again, but were it necessary, I'd hire Hanh in a heartbeat. He's that good."}
{"text":"I really don't do reviews as you all can tell from my profile.  But i am willing to make the time to give credit where credit is due.  I needed some legal advice for some personal matters thats been lingering in the back of my mind for quite some time now.  I decided to go to Nguyen Law Firm.  I see this lawyers face everywhere I go. On menus at Viet Noodle Bar, District One Kitchen and Bar, newspaper ads...etc.  Seems legit.  So i decided to stop by yesterday and was greeted by 2 receptionist.  They were friendly and told me to wait  in the waiting room.  A few moments later, I was greeted by a very professional, well mannered, friendly with a gorgeous smile woman.  She introduced her name as Ling.  She led me into a meeting office to the right and after 15 minutes of discussion, I knew what i had to do.  Ling is not only skilled at her profession, but she is funny, articulate, insightful, and sincere in her services to help you in your situation.  I will recommend her and her coworkers to anybody and everybody. 2 thumbs up because your firm is awesome.  Thank you!"}

Even though the first consultation is free, they try to make us understand the situation as much as possible and not hiding anything.  If you want to have the best service for your law need, why not Nguyen Law Firm."}
