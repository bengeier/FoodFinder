{"text":"Stopped by after a recent hockey game.  Nice to not have to pay the cover by showing them your game ticket.  I understand that the crowd adds to the atmosphere inside of places like this but this place was over packed.  It was crowded to the point of almost not being able to move.    We were able to find a spot at the bar and were really impressed by the bartender.  He actually took a sec to explain a drink special to my wife and had our drinks to us quicker than I thought was possible.  When friends were able to reach us at the bar the bartender saw that they had meet up with us and was right there to take their orders, really nice move on his part.  The people that were playing the instruments (I know it's a dueling piano bar, but believe me there are a ton of other musicians working here) were really good and definitely got the crowd going.  One real drawback in this place was the food. It probably wasn't the smartest idea to order food in a place that crowded but when your hungry you hope for the best. We didn't get the best, we got the barely edible."}
{"text":"Thank you so much Shout House for hosting FAMILY NIGHT!!!  Our group of four consisted of no children but we prefer entertainment that is not laden with profanity and sexual innuendo.  We had a blast singing and dancing from our seats and listening to the combined music/improv that is the Shout House.  We went on July 21st (2013) and the musicians were CRAZY talented and funny and the food was very reasonably priced.  I would have given 5 stars if the dining experience was slightly more comfortable.  I could not spy a booth in the entire joint.  Our family of four was tightly wedged around very small table with wobbly wooden chairs.  But it was a fun night for a good price so I would definitely go back on any 3rd Sunday of the month, the day they reserve for good clean fun."}
{"text":"This place is crap decide to do a friends birthday dinner at shout house, after margaritaville kitchen had problems and closed. Come to shout house for dinner get charge 5 dollars a person to go in to eat dinner!!! Dinner that is!!! And we are not allowed to put tables together to enjoy each others company.... Really no way to treat customers.  After all we order drinks when 20 minutes later the server comes back and tells us he forgot what we ordered!!! Seriously this is how they run a business. Further more one of the drinks come out completely wrong should have been a crown and coke ended up with jack and coke. Continued to order food btw what crap that is. Food comes out wrong. Birthday girl order southwestern panini with no cheese. (She really dont like cheese) ends up with a chicken sandwich on a hamburger bun. Not only that we end up with an extra order of chicken strips no one ordered. When the corrected order comes out...... It's still not correct the damn panini had cheese on it SHE DON'T LIKE CHEESE!!!"}
{"text":"If you like comedy, good music, and loud places...then you'll like this bar. There was a $5 cover at the door on a Friday night. Decent prices. Good drinks and their basket of fries was huge!! It's a good place for entertainment & the staff like to dance...and even try to make YOU dance too! You tip and request songs on a piece of paper and toss it into a bowl...hoping the musicians pick it! It's quite funny. Might be fun with a group of friends or for a bday party. But don't think I'll be back with just me & my boyfriend."}
{"text":"I will never go back after being told to shut up by the manager. I made an online reservation for my wife's birthday for 15 people weeks ago ($5/person =$75 ttl).  A few days later I received an email announcing FREE cover for the day I booked. I called one manager Bob and explained to me that even though there is no charge thy reservations still have pay the cover charge per person. Now, I get a call from one of my guest which had arrived before us telling me that they could not find my reservation but that the place was completely empty and they were going to allow her to hold a few tables until we arrived. When we got there I approached another manager (a blonde hair young lady) and explained to her my issue and asked for a refund since they were not charging cover and since my reservation was lost. She was not accompdating at all and in one instance through the conversation even told me to SHUSH/SHUT UP. I had to remind her who the customer was and that I didn't appreciate her telling me to shut up. And even still did not do anything for me. I will contact a home office if any."}
{"text":"A little of this place goes a long way. Some of the performers are better than others, I found, and someone should perhaps advise the entertainment committee that what's crude isn't necessarily what's clever. Still, the music and patter seemed to keep the lewd and tattoo'd muffin-tops, of which this place seems to attract a herd,  amused. Not my kinda place, sorry!"}
{"text":"Meet place went there one time. My girlfriends look me there for my 30 B-day Very cool entertainment but as the night went on the music got louder. I was only there for an hour. I could not stand my ear drums pounding so hard so I left. I had a hard time hearing outside my ear were plugged. By the next day my ears were ringing. 12 years later I still have ringing in my hears. I'm writing this review because I was ask to go again. No thanks! No entertainment is worth losing my hearing over."}
{"text":"We (husband and father-in-law) made our to the Shout House after a Saturday night Coyotes hockey game. Since we went to the game, we didn't have to pay a cover. The bar has a very large open lay-out, with the dueling pianos as the centerpiece. The entertainment was fantastic, they played all of the classic songs and took requests (seemed like tipping $10+ was the way to get your request played). Four different players rotated through the night, some even played drums or guitar for certain songs. The Big A*s Beers were a good deal, large plastic souvenir cup of a domestic draft (32 ounces) was the special of the night our waitress told us about ($5). The crowd was pretty wild and fun, lots of shots being taken on stage...probably 6 bachelorette parties, several 50th birthday parties, etc. A great finish to a great day! I wish this place was in my town, I would probably become a regular."}
{"text":"Tempting place to go while in WestGate!   I've been in  the service industry for over 15 years and Have been here several times with nothing but good times to report .   However tonight was the worst experience ever.  The management on this particular night was terrible.  Three us were served 32 oz beers at last call and were asked to leave within 3 min of ordering.  When complained we were told that we had 1 min to finish.  Upon asking for a refund, we were denied and escorted out of the establishment in a very rude manor.   Manager displayed poor customer service skills and was very condescending.  It's a shame because the talent created a very fun environment and a great evening that was undone by the poor management staff.  When sharing my experience with friends it amazed me how many of them said they enjoyed the pianos but the bouncers and support staff have away of creating an uncomfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews but this is my favorite place in glendale especially if you like live piano playing (I am a pianist my self and these guys are so talented; I could never in a million year do what they do and I have played classic piano for about 12 years!)  I grew up in Glendale and know of only a few places to go on certain nights.  However, this place is great..  I assure you the musicians are great if you have a musical ear and a sense of humor.  They can pretty much play anything you request.   Finally, they have pretty good drink specials and have very nice bartenders.  a sense of humor."}
{"text":"I personally LOVEEE this place. Me and my friend come here every wednesday for the $1 drinks, and sometimes on the weekend. The bartender pours really good drinks. The pianists are really talented and great at singing and playing the other instruments. Overall, its a lot of fun. (:"}
{"text":"Well...it's fun. However:  The wait staff ignored us after the first round of beers; The musicians were fun but emphatically mediocre. They take requests and shout the lyrics somewhat on key accompanying themselves with the kinda right chords and an occasional co-shouted out effort at harmony.   We never did get a chance to order food because the waitress never came back.  We were able to get a check so we could go get dinner somewhere else by chasing the waitress at the back of the bar.   We were in collectively good moods so this was...well...amusing."}
{"text":"My visit to The Shout House was simply out of convenience on the day of the Fiesta bowl because the other restaurants had lines 40 people deep. Anyway, the dueling piano cover music was pretty entertaining, the food adequate for the type of bar, and our service was decent considering how packed it was. I will agree with another reviewer that the menu is definitely lacking substance, but I think this a tavern/bar first and restaurant second. You could make the same food at home with your Fry Daddy.  We got a menagerie of their appetizers for our group of six and went at it. The onion rings were excellent, fries - typical, Schwans truck chicken tenders - good, chicken quesedilla - better than average, cheese stix - typical.   If you are more concerned about swilling beers and singing along to some goofy, cruise-ship style entertainment and less about pleasing your palate, give the Shout House a try."}
{"text":"Gave it a second try, I am still at my first conclusion. It's loud, bathrooms filthy, strange location upstairs, expensive and the quality of bartenders is subpar. (extremely subpar) Who is running this place anyways? I think no-one. Eek! Methinks not!"}
{"text":"I took a friend from out of town to the Shout House, and we stayed for 4 hours of fun! Most piano bars that I've been to just have two people playing piano and singing- fun, but not anything amazing really. This place had all-staff dances, unique birthday songs, and even a fiddle player! The waitress did mess up one of our food items, but we ate it anyway, and she was so nice that it made up for the error. I'd be interested to see if all the other servers were as good, but ours was at our table every 10 minutes or so. This place is awesome if you want to relax and see a great show while downing a few beers. The negatives would be that the food is slow and average to sub-par for bar food. Also the mixed drinks are kind of pricey. However, I had so much fun that I can't give this place anything less than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Living close to Westgate, I often get tour guide duty when friends or family come to town. What do I do? I take them to Shout House. The drinks are huge, and cheap, the songs are always funny and on point, but must of all, it's a great place for any age or genre. From grandma's to Uncle Toms, to my most uninhibited hot mess friends, this place has enough action and enough good booze to keep everyone happy. I always see bachelorette and birthday parties celebrated there. Do yourself a favor and check it out on a Friday or Saturday night. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I enjoy the finer things in life.  The music of Air Supply, the films of Michael Bay, and fine dining.  So when I drunkenly stumbled across the Shout House one evening, I knew this place was right up my alley.  I got into the restaurant and was told to sit wherever I please.  That's always a sign of a classy restaurant. Freedom to do as you want, America style.  I sat outside because I wanted to make sure that as many people as possible saw me eating there.  I was not disappointed.  I can't even tell you how many people walked by saying, \"you're in for the worst experience of your life.\"  I knew they were just jealous.    The waitress, whose name escapes me (because of the aforementioned drunkenness), took about ten minutes to decide to come to our table.  I like it when restaurants seem to have a policy of making their patrons wait.  It just amps up the anticipation.  I ordered a Blue Moon, because I had already had eleven Jack and Cokes before breakfast and figured it was time to slow down.  I had just come from church, for chrissakes.  Taste is not a thing I enjoy, so when my Blue Moon arrived watered down fifteen minutes later (more waiting! :D) I was particularly excited.  \"Mmmm this is totally worth $5,\" I thought.    \"I'm glad you like it,\" replied my striking blonde (?) waitress.    \"Did I say that out loud?\" I said back.  I really can't stress enough how drunk I was.  \"You did.  You've also been ranting about Communists since you came in, and I think you peed your pants.\"  \"You have a good eye, sir.\"  \"I'm a woman.\"  We sat there in silence for four minutes.  \"FOOD!\" I said.  \"I want food!\"  This startled the waitress, and she screamed.  \"Feed me.\"  \"Yes, fine.  What will it be?\"  \"Cheeseburger and fries.  Medium.\"  \"Done deal.\"  Forty minutes later my burger showed up.  Some people like to compare food to heaven, others hell.  \"Mmmm this is purgatory!\" I exclaimed!  \"There's absolutely nothing notable about this food at all. And look! You forgot the cheese! I knew it would bring too much spice to my meal.\"  Half an hour later, my ginger (?) waitress returned with the check.  \"Wow! All this for only $40!?\" I said.  \"I expect a good tip,\" my waitress, who I think had black hair, said.  \"Oh you'll get a good tip!,\" I replied.  As soon as she walked away, I got up and left because I suddenly remembered I had no money.  I would DEFINITELY recommend The Shout House to anyone who likes watered down beer, burgers that taste like water, and waiting around.  I just remembered, my waitress was a brunette.  And a man."}
{"text":"I took my date to the shout house as I hadn't been there for a couple of months but I always loved going there in the past. I don't know if it was an off night or a sign of things to come but it was awful. Service was terrible, no tables or chairs were available as they booked everything for reservations now. Food was slow and average as well. When it came to the entertainment below average. The guys voices were off key and concentrated on some very drunk women. Like I said I used to love this place but last night was just awful. I also do not like the new changes to the place as well."}
{"text":"great place to just hangout and get a few drinks. not a great place to order food. we ordered food and it literally took 2 hours to get the order after we had cancelled it. waitress seemed very forgetful. There weren't many people to be waiting on either. however, drinks were decent and everyone loves a \"big ass beer\""}
{"text":"I went to the Shout House for the first time a couple of weeks ago. Fun place. The service was so so, not amazingly attentive but nothing worth griping about either. At one point the whole staff was up on stage and on the bar dancing. You could tell that some of them do not enjoy doing that. All in all, I will go back at least once."}
{"text":"Not my first time to this place but probably my last. Went on a Friday night and knew the food would be \"okay\" and the booze is booze. Usually really enjoy the music but got rather annoyed with the musicians constant frisking of the patrons for money/music requests. Felt more like I was supporting the homeless population with drug money than enjoying the night. Crossed the line for me."}
{"text":"If it were possible to give a few negative stars,  we certainly would.   Hands down the worst service I've ever had from ANY restaurant EVER.    We arrived at 5:45pm prior to an 8pm concert. You would think 2 hours would be adequate time to budget for dinner, but not here. We placed our dinner order at 6pm. At 6:45 the waitress stopped by to tell us they only have enough grind for one plate. So we said bring it out and we will split. At 7:15 the waitress is MIA. At 7:45 after not seeing the waitress for an hour, they put a flyer on our table saying its reserved at 8pm, in 15 minutes.   Then they hand us a bill for the nonexistent food that never arrived. What a joke.   Management should consider new careers and close that kitchen since they can't actually deliver food.   Jesus, what s bunch of duck ups! They are so ducked.   PS. We ended up having hot dogs and French fries at Aerosmith. Great concert!"}
{"text":"This place is a great venue for any sort of celebration.  I've been here many times but recently we attended a work Christmas party here.  Absolutely gust-busting funny.  It's especially fun to watch those up-tight, do-gooders that you work with, when the crazy, rude, obnoxious, funny-as-hell lyrics come out of the musician's mouths.  F'n love it!!!  These guys are truly talented and keep the party rollin'.  The food and drinks aren't bad either, but without the dueling pianos, bass guitar, drums and antics....this would just be another drinkin' hole."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing. Granted we went during the midweek, this place was dead. I counted 5 other people in the whole bar. The staff were not welcoming and didn't care to make an effort. I hate to critisize the musicians, because I'm sure that they are generally good... however for my short time there... these guys didn't know the lyrics to the classic songs they were playing on the piano (and I mean CLASSICS). It just made for a very buzz killing start to the night.   On the upside for my fellow yelpers, I am told that this was rare and that usually this is a great night out. I guess I just caught this place on a bad night. Oh well, we all have our bad days."}
{"text":"I don't get it about this place,very unspectacular. There on July 4th early enough time to eat and see the fireworks. Nope. 25 min for drinks and water then another 30 min at least for a single chicken sandwich I'm guessing because we gave up and I went searching for out waitress just so we could leave. They were not that crowded when we got there, no waiting. Staff looked confused as if they were temps for the anticipated 4th crowd., I saw servers wonder from tables to see if this is what someone ordered. I'm guessing they just aren't prepared for spikes in biz. I'd be furious if I had to pay a cover for this place."}
{"text":"I have been to piano bars all around the country, from Miami to Cali and back and this was by far and without a doubt the crapiest one!!  I genuinely like piano bars since they can be a really fun place to blow off steam while enjoying a good show; not here!!!!!!  Never a good sign that the place was pretty empty on a Saturday night the weekend of Cinco de Mayo and the Kentucy Derby, but nonetheless I and four other guests sat down.  I can easily handle the unstable tables or that all of the chairs felt like they were just about the break apart, I'm actually good with that.  I can even handle the fact that it took our waitress almost 20 minutes to just say hi as she walked by to another table.  I would even go so far to say I can handle the horrible tasting food, it's a bar right????? Your there for fun, not a gastronomic awakening!    What made this place the crapiest piano bar in the United States was the continuous Barry Manilow cover songs with an interspersed Elton John number- and they were horrible at both!  The drinks are VERY short pours, let me say this again since it bears repeating- THE BARTENDERS SHORT POUR YOU TO THE POINT OF BEING OFFENSIVE.  I went up to the bar (which was empty as well, I can see pattern forming here.....) and was met by a young man who was giving me the \"what the hell do you want?\" stare.   I asked to have my martini look like a martini and not a  1/2 shot in a martini glass.  His reply was \"well that's what you get unless you pay for more\".  Holly crap, what a horrible place!  Here's the bill lowdown- 2 martini's, 2 Grey Goose mandarin and sprites- total bill-------- $72!!!  That's before tip (which they sure as hell don't deserve) or anything else since I paid for the burger with cash at delivery.    There are a ton of other great piano bars in the valley and there are some good bars in the Glendale area, just stay away from this shit hole.  I would bet $20 that this place is closed by the health department within a year, that is, unless it goes out of business for being such a disappointment.  DO NOT GO TO THE SHOUT HOUSE IN GLENDALE, AZ.  Chewing tin foil would be more fun than going back there."}
{"text":"Going to the Shout House is great fun!  Talented pianists with a sick, but fun sense of humor.  Definitely for an over 21 crowd, but a really great place to go."}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of the shout house basically since they've opened, but now it's even better!  Cover has been reduced, only $8 after 7pm and ladies (woo that includes me!) are free after 10pm!  There's no cover during the week and all the same great entertainment!  The service has also improved big time!  I think they got rid of the bad ones and got some good ones in there.  They even have a JELLO shot girl now, you can get them with whip cream and everything!    Another great thing is family nights on sundays. My friends have a youngster or two and its always great to find places to take them.  It's so cute to see them rockin out to the pianos!  Oh, and so you know its a G-rated show on sundays :)   I love the shout house!  Every place has got its bumps, but nothing severe enough has happened to keep me away from this place!"}
{"text":"Went there with a couple of my friends. I really enjoyed myself! It was a Saturday so we expected a crowd. The energy of the place was great. The musicians were awesome, very engaging and were definite crowd pleasers! The drinks were tasty and the prices weren't too bad. I really wish that we didn't have to pay a cover but I understand why you ask for one, especially on the weekend. The only thing that really bothered me was the outside area. Only one side of the \"patio\" was opened for use because there was some type of corporate gathering who had reserved the patio yet was not using it. Therefore, the one side that was open to the patrons was jammed packed full of drunkards spilling their drinks and clumsily ashing their cigarettes everywhere. Over all though, I had a great experience there and will more than likely return!"}
{"text":"I have frequented the Shout House a few times in the past month and I do have to say that it is a fun place to be. The first time I went, I didn't realize that there was a cover charge ($8), which I believe is a bit steep, but we went for a birthday and that's where the birthday girl wanted to go. We went in, sat down, and ordered drinks. The prices were decent inside, but what really made it fun was the loud loud LOUD music. They equally played classic rock and newer music that everyone knew and was getting really into. It is also a pretty raunchy place too, so I say don't go if you get easily embarrassed being called out in front of everyone unless you sit in the very back. The second time I went back, it was after 10pm and apparently that's when ladies get in for free, which was a major plus! I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Love this place, getting older (25) not about the dance clubs anymore the music is good the beer is cheap and I always have a good time. The staff is awesome to."}
{"text":"HA!  I knew this place would fold eventually. Way overpriced, from a ridiculous cover charge to greedy piano players who made patrons \"bid\" against each other to get songs played, to management that was totally incompetent. So happy to see this place finally fail.   Karma comes back to bite them in the tail! Good riddance!"}
{"text":"Super super FUN place! We went to the Shout House for drinks after having dinner at the Yard House. It was packed, so we just stood at the bar. Everyone was super friendly, & I love how everyone gets involved & sings along. Never been anyplace like it. Next time I would love to reserve a table up front & go with a big group of friends."}
{"text":"Disappointing... Sorry,as a business owner myself, I know the importance of reviews to help improve.. My first impression was \"this could be fun!l\" nice environment.. Then the drinks came. The beer was so bad we couldn't drink it and sent it back.. Foggy.. Tasted like metal. Then the sliders came.. Over cooked and bad, just bad.. Which is too bad.. These are simple fixes.. Clean your pipes and get cooks who care! Won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Food was so so and the entertainment on their comedy night blew...not even close to par with the fullerton, ca location"}
{"text":"Do NOT waste your time or money going to this place. We've been here 4 times in a few years down and every SINGLE time we've had an issue with EXTREMELY rude, tool bag employees. The \"bouncers\" have a complex and like to pick fights with potential customers- and they apparently don't like making money since they treat everyone like shit. It's no wonder that the last 2 times we've come it's been completely empty. We will never be coming here ever again. I don't recommend it to anyone, ever. I would give it no stars, but I don't have a choice... So 1 I guess it is."}
{"text":"Fun, high energy dueling piano bar. Bartenders are friendly"}
{"text":"I must make the unfair and inevitable comparison between the Shout House in San Diego, and the Shout House at Westgate, and they are in different leagues. That is just the cold hard truth - but I was still impressed by the Shout House at Westgate. Not only do they use what they got, they tweak it and own it.   I had a great time this weekend at the Shout House. The audience participation was impressively great, the service was excellent. The prices overall wasn't bad at all. I had 8 sliders for $15, and although they were not culinary reinventions - they were perfect grub next to my revealingly classless beers.   Did I say that the service was awesome - ok, I did. Lets see.. no, I guess that wraps it up. It doesn't hit the excellent for their namesake in California, but they sure are a great time out and I sang-along the whole night.  Nice going Shout House.. und das ist nach die heiser Kritiker"}
{"text":"I have now been contacted by 3 Managers for the SH regarding my complaint. I never expected this much attention! They are obviously committed to the customer experience and and righting any negatives. The next time we're in West Gate we will visit the SH again."}
{"text":"loud,Loud,LOUD!!!! But its great fun! No, you cant talk to anyone cause who is gonna hear you?  This is a great place to use text messaging as a way to communicate! The piano players are great, funny, crude, rude and gets the very crowded room moving, jumping, shouting.  They have a great  greasy spoon' menu. I like buckets of burgers my self. And thank goodness you can step outside for fresh air and quiet when needed.  Is it for kids NO NO NO. These folks can get down right raunchy in jokes. And the patrons can get mighty drunk. Which means leave before they do cause there wasn't a designated driver in the bunch.  But, hey, you didn't expect it to be classical piano playing joint. Its a party till you drop. laugh till your face hurts,  and your ears are ringing and the world is spinning and you want a morning after aspirin fun kind of place!"}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurant experiences ever. Went on game day for the Cardinals. We were one of the first ones in the restaurant.  After waiting 45 minutes for our food and watching everyone around us get their food, eat, and pay their bill, we sat with nothing. Neither the server nor assistant manager knew what the issue was (obviously part of the problem). We asked for the manager but she was no where to be found. I wish I could rate this place 0 stars. This place downright stinks. We ended up leaving with no food and hungry."}
{"text":"Huh?!?!  Did you say something?!  Oh!  You need a napkin!?!  Oh you weren't' talking to me!?!?   LMFAO!!  It is called the Shout House for a reason!   It is LOUD as hell and the perfect place to go if you don't give a crap about what is being said around you.  the drinks were ok and the food sucked.  But it's all about the atmosphere right? :-)  the piano guys were funny but it was honestly so loud that you couldn't understand a word that they were singing....but I knew all the songs so sang them all to myself! :-)  And because it was so loud....no one realized that I SUCK at singing!!  It wasn't horrible....but it isn't somewhere I would go for dinner and a show.  But for a drunken hunger fix....and to see a large drunk girl in a really small black dress fall off of the piano and show her bits and pieces to the whole audiance.....TOTALLY the place to be!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the musicians and serving staff are wonderful! I went here for a Bachelorette Party on a Saturday night and our server was so busy, but still really attentive and polite. The musicians were amazing! They took requests and had a lot of fun interacting with the crowd!  That being said, the door man could use a class in customer service. We had a large party and so we made reservations weeks in advance and prepaid for our cover. We arrived 5 minutes late and the first thing he said to the bachelorette was that they almost gave our table away because we were so late. Really?! Do the math in your head and calculate cover for 20 girls, plus drinks for at least 2 hours, plus shots = revenue for the bar. Don't give us crap for being a little late. Besides, I have never worked at a place that took a reservation for 20 people and didn't give them a courtesy 15 minutes to arrive. 15 minutes wouldn't make a difference in the server's income and on a Saturday night they'd be able to fill the tables without a problem if we hadn't shown up. So why give us crap right from the star? Especially the bachelorette."}
{"text":"Piano bar experience was OK.  However, we ordered the pizza and it was the worst food I have eaten (attempted to eat).  Frozen crust - cardboard would have tasted better.  Shame on you for even allowing it in the back door!"}
{"text":"Paid $10 to get in and listen to amateur singers....then $8 a beer WTF??? Terrible investment!!!  More like torturous entertainment than fun???  Don't waste money here!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very fun piano bar. I was up on stage singing and dancing. As packed as it was staff tried keeping floor and tables clean. They have a nice outside sitting area to get much needed air."}
{"text":"I was part of a 10 year reunion planning committee and we chose this venue because it has everything we needed- food, booze, and entertainment :) Jessica the manager was very kind, and Eric was very helpful through the process - overall, the staff made it an enjoyable experience and the alumni had a blast like we knew they would."}
{"text":"The worst food ever! I've been sick for two days after two bites of the tacos! When will it end?! Ugh.   Okay drinks. Kind of watery."}
{"text":"The Shout House is closed out of business at Westgate in Glendale. In the beginning it was great but it really took a dive the last couple of years. Too bad."}
{"text":"This is a great piano bar! great vibe and drunk people falling at the drop of a hat! gotta love it!!"}
{"text":"My family celebrated my brother's 21st birthday here. Seriously, the best time EVER! The staff was friendly, the entertainers were funny, and the vibe was awesome. We can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I brought my wife there for Mother's Day. I set up a surprise flower delivery, and let the managers know ahead of time that I would like them delivered with the meal. Not only did they quickly and kindly agree to my request, when Pro-flowers didn't send my flowers, the managers took it upon themselves to run out and get replacement flowers before I even got there. Best customer service experience of my life. My wife loved it, and I will be forever grateful to their wonderful staff."}
{"text":"I flew into Arizona from California last Saturday morning in order to take my Girlfriend on a date night.  After dinner, we went to this place, \"The Shout House!\".  My girlfriend had been there before, but this was my first time.  I have to say, \"It was a blast!\".  if you have never been here, then  you \"MUST\" visit.  It's fun, energetic, funny, great music, and all drinks are made wonderfully.  It's hard to explain, if you have never been here, but let's say that it is like watching a comedy and band all in one rolled up performance!  This place is a definite \"Must Visit\"!"}
{"text":"I'll tread lightly on this one since my girlfriend loves this place.   So here's the deal. After the Coyotes game, we stopped in for a drink and to relax for a bit before leaving to head home. I found the atmosphere to be a bit different. not bad, just a little different than what I am used to.   The dueling pianos had just stared and there were some older women there who were already way too drunk, trying to dance on stage. That was interesting to watch. One of the piano players even took one of the gals off the stage at some point.   The atmosphere isn't bad. Once the place filled up, the songs started and the crowd was expected to sing along to them. Some of the songs are quite explicit, so this may not suit everyone's taste.   I also felt embarrassed for the women who the piano players called up to sing in front of everyone. They were good sports about it though. The service was ok, nothing too amazing. The place was super loud though, so conversation here is pretty much out of the question.   I would go back only if I was brought back by my girlfriend. Not sure I would go on my own."}
{"text":"We went with friends to the Sunday Family Night. What a fun place- all of the musicians were very talented and personable!  The wait staff was also fun. Food was only average and beer selection wasn't great, but we still managed to have a great evening!"}
{"text":"This is fun.  I like to sit back, drink beer and laugh my ass off with friends.  Pizza is great.   The other appetizers seem to come out of a box and they don't seem that appetizing.  But... the topper for the night... was them singing \"Dear Penis\" to an embarrassed man on his 50th birthday... now that was classic."}
{"text":"Let's put it this way--Shout House will NEVER be known for it's fine cuisine. That having been said, it was a great alternative to the otherwise overloaded restaurants that line Westgate because people weren't looking UP to the 2nd floor! Our server was delightful, the drinks were plentiful, the atmosphere was fun, even if it was early in the night and before the hockey game. The food was typical bar food fair and with the Yelp check in, a burger, fries, and drink was a good deal but again--don't go there solely to eat because you'll be sorrily disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been to the Shout House a couple times now, on a Friday and a Saturday night.  Saturday night the place was packed, with a majority of the tables taken (or set aside for reservations) by 7:00.  Friday was a little more laid back.  I believe on the weekends the cover is $5 before 7:00, after that it is $10.  They have various special during the weeknights as well.    Always lots of \"birthdays\" being celebrated, and you can submit song requests (accompanied by a tip).  There always seems to be an intoxicated schmuck in the front getting a little carried away, but security seems to always be on top of things.  My go to drink has been the Big Ass Beer ($7 for the first, $5 for refills same day only).    All in all a good place to take a group of friends for as much or less than it would cost to go to a club."}
{"text":"Thank you for the best Mother's Day ever!! You squeezed us when reservations were full, service was amazing. My grandmother is 79, my nephew is 5. We had all ages in between and everyone had a blast. Phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Good service.  Food is terrible and tasteless.  They claim to be \"better than The Big Bang\" but it's false advertising.  The Big Bang is MUCH better.  The singers are good and can play piano well, but they don't seem to know very many songs and the ones they do sing, they slur their words and it seems like they don't really know all of the lyrics to those songs either.  Where they really shine is when the entire band gets going and they all harmonize together.  They had a female violinist join them for a few songs that was amazing!  If you don't live nearby, there's really no reason to go here."}
{"text":"Went here over the weekend with my girlfriend because I have heard such great things about this piano bar.   Wasn't to happy with a cover charge, but non the less we paid and went inside.   Their two male bartenders were awesome and mixed all my drinks the right way. It's nice to find a person who can make your drinks the right way and not make you feel like you weren't skimped on the alcohol.   Maybe it was just an off night or maybe we weren't in the mood for the piano's but we sat on the patio drinking and enjoying everyone's company.   We drank for a good few hours and when I tabbed out I expected to have a pretty large bill. BUT I was happy to see that their drinks were reasonably priced and they never charged us for all the cokes my DD was drinking. :) \"GOOD JOB SHOUT HOUSE\"   We will come back and have to enjoy this place more often!"}
{"text":"I flew out here in September for a game. I came here 4 times in 7 days. This place is awesome great entertainment. The service is good did not have to wait long for a drink. I definitely will be coming back here."}
{"text":"Amazing Burgers!!! A place where you can drink and sing aloud, I'm in love.   Date: Thursday March 29, 2012 @ 8:30PM   Ok, it's a Thursday and it was a bit dead...  There was a Westgate event happening, and the regular menu was not available, I was looking forward to a bucket of sliders, yes bucket.   We ordered 2 Big Ass Beers ($7.00 each, and you keep the 32oz. cup - $5.00 refills). Enjoyed the music, and singing along and request are encouraged.  Ordered a few refills and then a burger w/ fries and a 12oz. beer for $9.00... This burger blindsided me... who would have thought, this place has one of the best burgers I've ever had.  *************  Atmosphere/Music:  Friendly, many tables, a little crude at times.  One of their piano players sang his heart out....  A performer who really gets into it always makes it the show more fun!  Service:  Maybe on a Fri or Sat there are more servers... But I think there was only 1 server for the whole place. He got out check wrong, (I had 96oz. of Bud and knew it was $4 off) but fixed it when I mentioned it to him.  *************  Will I Return:  Yes, I really want another one of those burgers and Big Ass Beers...  and to sing my heart."}
{"text":"I will NEVER, EVER go back here. End of story.   I went with the boyfriend right after it opened in Feb. '08. It was some special neither of us paid cover and it was $5 cosmos for ladies. The funny thing is my beer drinking BF ordered a Cosmo and received it for $5, maybe the waitress thought this funny or something, I sure did.   Anyway, the music was out of sync between the two piano players, the kitchen was closed and it was only 10 or 11 PM and the guy playing the piano reminded me of a super annoying Joe Pesci with his dumb jokes. They embarrassed some drunk girl on her birthday with really vulgar stuff.   I'm not a prude, in fact I'm pretty foul mouthed and minded, but if this guy said that stuff to me I probably would have knocked him right off his piano stool.   We finished the only drink we ordered, payed our bill and booked it to The Yardhouse to enjoy the reverse happy hour and some beer."}
{"text":"If my friend ever suggests this place again I'm gonna make a list of songs I want to request before going because when you're there & drinking you can't think of anything.  The 2 guys on piano were kind of vulgar. The way 1 of them stared at me made me uncomfortable until I got more drinks in me.   They didn't know Jaime's Cryin' by Van Halen :( They'd already played Sweet Caroline by Neil Diamond but played the chorus for us when we asked why they hadn't played it. They didn't know Hey Bulldog by The Beatles & I can't remember what song they played instead.  I'm 21 & was born in the 80's, I didn't live through it. I knew maybe 4 or 5 songs that others requested well enough to sing along with the rest of the patrons.  There was no cover. We were there on a Tue. The security guy at the door checking id's made my 29 yr old friend who looks 19 tell him his age & first name. Later, on the way out this same guy flirtily asked me for my phone number but didn't I didn't give it to him. I'm not exactly sure why I didn't though. He wasn't too bad looking. I'm blaming all that on the alcohol.  Speaking of alcohol, I have no clue how much anything costs. I sat at a table & wasn't buying.  Their bathrooms are really nice too. Big & clean. Maybe I was too drunk though because I was bested by the paper towel dispenser. I couldn't figure out how to work them. And yes, I KNOW that makes me sound like a moron but I really was too impatient to care. There was a roll on the counter so I was good.  They closed down a little before midnight. Once the guys stopped playing the place shut down. Strange, but no biggie since there are other places to go just a stumble away."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It's so much fun, esp if you go with a group of people who don't mind being silly and getting made fun of. There was an $8 cover last night, which I'm not sure if that's every day or after a certain time at night. We got there right when happy hour ended (5-7pm) but we still loaded up on drinks and shots for the bday girl! We had brass monkey, the souvenir glass rum, big ass beer on tap, and a bunch of other shots (jello, blowjob, pink pussy, red headed slut, etc..) Drinks were on the pricier side, but how often do you go to these things right? We also got a basket of fries and it was HUGE, I love that they used seasoned salt on them too, gave it a nice flavor  There are dueling pianos, which two guys playing together (and last night there were two others playing drums and bass and switching bt piano too) and they play pretty much any song you request which is the greatest part! Four white guys on stage singing journey to gun and roses, garth brooks to snoop dogg was amazing. They even had the favorites (cheers bar song, friends theme song) and sang in good spirits. We had a great time! The staff also comes up on stage and dances so that was cute  Make sure you bring a lot of cash, especially ones, since you pay tips to get them to sing what you want. It took us a few tries, but later on in the night, it gets more expensive. It took over $20 to get them to get our bday girl friend on stage and they played Sir Mix-a-lot's Baby Got Back while she danced on stage. Make sure you participate, they will shine that flashlight on you and pull you on stage if you don't participate! People get pretty drunk throughout the night, and you got lotsa fake boobies making it on stage to request music. These are men playing after all so they pretty much oogle all the goodies coming up to them!"}
{"text":"Give a Shout out   This was my first time at the Shout House and I have to admit I had a really good time.  The food choices at The Shout House consist of the typical \"bar type\" food and are fairly limited. However, the food is good if you just want to sit and nibble at a leisurely pace, while drinking your beverage of choice.  The main attraction at the Shout House  are the two Baby Grand Pianos which are back to back on the stage. There are two large mirrors suspended behind the pianos which allows you to  see the performers and the crowd.     On the tables there  are  forms and pencils for you to write your song requests . The repertoire of songs being played covers a large variety of music preferences and it's' great to hear the crowd sing along with songs of the past and present.  I've been to a few dual piano bars however,  the pianists at the Shout  House are truly gifted.  The pianist exchanged jokes and comments, and involved the crowd.  They were very entertaining.   The wait-staff at the Shout House are excellent, being attentive but not intrusive while breaking off periodically to contribute to the entertainment and engage customers.   So if your looking for a leisurely night out, stop by the Shout House, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and have never paid a cover. They use to open at 6pm and cover started at 7 on weekends, they now open at 7. I prefer the 6pm open time and they are missing out on valuable happy hour opportunities in my opinion. If you make a reservation for 2 or more they waive the cover, not sure how long that will be. Honestly, a cover is unnecessary for this place, if it's to pay the musicians, they seem to be doing just fine, every time we've been there, they are tipped heavily. I've never had bad service here, everyone from the door, the guy going around picking up empty glasses, people bringing the food, wait staff to the bar have been outgoing. Saturday was slammed, standing room only around 9 so the wait staff was busy but, I always had eyes on her and was able to grab her or motion when I needed a refill. We like sitting in the bar area, it's not as loud and if the wait staff is busy-turn around and go order directly from the bar. The manager even bought one beer for us posting a photo of the Big Ass beer cup on Facebook.  We ordered the Quesadilla & a Veggie burger from the kitchen and nothing was left on our plate they were so good. This and 4 drinks ran around $47. The mixed drinks have always been poured like I make at home, never a disappointment there. Some musicians are better than others, they all are good with working with the crowd. Starting with warm up slowly working the crowd into joining in and getting dirtier with the lyrics as the night progresses. Don't be bummed if they don't play your requested song, there are some that for artist copyright reasons, they aren't allowed to play. If you don't like simulated sex acts on stage or vulgarity this is not for you. Really, I think most people that go here are going just for that! There were at least 5 people celebrating their birthday this night and they were treated to all kinds of shenanigans on stage, fun to watch! Come with an open attitude & tip money and you'll have a good time."}
{"text":"I actually had fun here... but that was after we waited over 20 minutes to find a seat. I think the $8 cover charge is a bit much, but it obviously didn't matter to the packed crowd that was already inside.   The guys on the piano were pretty funny and played some good songs, though there were a few repeats. The crowd interaction and participation was  really cool - seems like a popular spot for bachelorette parties and birthdays."}
{"text":"We went here for a friends birthday. Wow, that was fun. A must try experience. P.S. You will have to participate to have fun."}
{"text":"Oh how I love this place. So why only 4 and not 5 stars? Well, there are some cons to it, so ill just be honest about the spot, like always.    PROS-  1. The piano guys are AMAZING! James is my favorite (see picture below).  2. The beer is reasonably priced ($4 bucks for a bud)  3. The chicken nachos are yummy.   4. Staff is friendly and casual.   5. I get to dress up and wear heels but sit most of the night so my toes don't hurt lol.   CONS-  1. This is their only spot in AZ, and its way the heck at Westgate. I live downtown, and while its worth the drive, its still a bit of a drive out there. Wish they were more centrally located.   2. After having been here several times, primarily the same songs get played. I believe most of what they play is based off requests, but I am surprised it doesn't get switched up more.   3. There is a cover after 8pm, $7 bucks.  4. Food is kinda pricey, if you ask my cheap self.   5. Reservations have to be made online only, and its kinda a pain to do.   Overall, I do love this place which is why I keep coming back. The place is small and fills up fast, I suggest arriving early if you want a good seat. Also, I wouldn't dress too warm it gets very hot in there!"}
{"text":"Another westgate rip off,you gotta pay to get in,the bartenders are clueless and inept when it come to makeing drinks,the piano players are TERRIBLE..they just bang the keys and yell the lyrics almost trying to sound bad its really grating on the ears,,its not fun its not cool,skip it."}
{"text":"I have wanted to go see a dueling piano show for forever, I had heard there is a place in Tempe off Mill, but that it gets crowded unless your super early and that didn't strike my fancy.  So when a friend said she is getting a group together on a Saturday to go check out the Shout House at Westgate I was all for it!  We got to the Shout House about 7:30ish, and my friend who has been here before had reserved tables for the group and after been there for while a noticed that that is the way to go, the place fills up pretty quick and turns into standing room only.  For me, it was a blast I love the look of a baby grand piano and to have 2 on stage next to each other, man that was hot, and to watch the guys fingers just fly over the keys, yea it was a good night for sure!  But they have more than just piano playing going on, they even bust out with the guitar and beat some drums, and this amazing chick comes out and just plays her heart out on the violin, she was great, made playing the violin look cool, maybe I should have played that instead of the flute haha    They have good drink prices and even serve food, service was kind of slow, but she was handling a huge crowd, but I suspect that to be the same size crowd every weekend.  The crowd had a great vibe, everyone smiling and singing/shouting along. I am a music person so this place was for me, but if you don't like loud music or the neighbor next to you singing along as if she is Adele but really more like Sanjaya , or some impromptu dancing and shouting happening, then this might not be the place for you, but me it was a great time and I will be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go.  Great happy hour on Friday."}
{"text":"We go here all the time for a good time! Great atmosphere and entertainment. Went in for my birthday and there was about 30 of us and the waitress was awesome!"}
{"text":"Went for New Year's last night with my hubby. Rachel, our server, was bubbly, enthusiastic, genuine and engaging. Excellent service, the prime rib buffet was delish as well. There were some amazing violin players to accompany the dueling pianos. I gave them 5 stars because service was on the ball from host to busser and the food was quality.  The musical experience was a little \"pedestrian\" at times but that's to be expected when you're playing to a large, varied group and trying to make everyone happy.  Overall a nice evening out for us."}
{"text":"Overall great experience... Food is mediocre and drinks are ummmm decent, but you shouldn't be coming to a piano bar for their \"great\" cuisine, the entertainers are on point with fun well tuned songs and witty banter, definitely a pre party spot!    3 Stars for the entertainment, room to grow.   You want 5 stars? Re-do the entire food menu & beer selection!"}
{"text":"Your kidding. A burger takes 40 minutes. The nachos arrived. Then we waited and waited and waited.  This place is not worth it.  Ok. The general manager just comped the burger and drinks. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Unexpected. That pretty much sums it up!   I've been to piano bars before, but never to one where the later it got the raunchier the 'jokes' got :) All in good fun of course!   Very interesting & diverse crowd. I personally liked when all all the other instruments joined in. Very talented musicians! Good place to go for girls night or as an alternative to karaoke, lol"}
{"text":"The Shout House is a dueling piano bar in Westgate.  I have been there twice and each night has been borderline too ridiculous for me to handle.  The dueling piano boys are raunchy and hilarious.  You will be entertained and laughing, especially if you can appreciate borderline over the top inappropriate behavior and comments.  I would reserve a visit for a night where you are looking to go out pretty hard.    There is a cover Thursday-Saturday, I believe it is $10 after 8, which means you will likely pay the $10.  I don't like paying cover so that takes away an entire star.  The drinks are random, depending on who your bartender is.  I once ordered a rum and diet and my waiter stole it away from me before I was done.  He wasn't happy with me when I inquired about all the booze that I hadn't gotten to enjoy at the bottom of my glass."}
{"text":"Some friends and I went here during one of the bike nights.  9$ special for a burger, beer and fries was a great deal.  The burgers were pretty good, nice decent patty size and good amount of toppings.  That alone would probably have given this place 4 stars.....  However while I was enjoying the music I wrote down a song request and one of the putzes behind the pianos kept my 10$ tip but took my request, tore it up and threw it off the stage and said into the mic \"whoever sent this up here, I'm not playing this shit!\"  I don't wanna say what song it was exactly but it was just a standard song other bar bands play all the time and they had already played another song from the same artist earlier.  For being ripped off and the douche attitude of the pianist (Jeff?) I give it 1 star.  Other than that the service was about average for a bar."}
{"text":"It's Saturday night and the bf's 30th birthday.  A group of us decided to head to The Shout House since it was fun the last time we went (Nov 2008).  This time, however, was not enjoyable.  We got there around 9pm and paid our cover.  We were lucky enough to find a table that was a good distance from the stage.   After about 20 minutes a waitress finally came over for our order.  We got a round of beer and water - the water never came and it took another 20 minutes to get the beer.  The place was not crowded so I'm not sure what the hold up was.    As we were drinking our beer we could not help but notice the table next to us: about half a dozen middle aged single women that were incredibly drunk and overweight that were grinding on each other.  Then the painist introduced an engaged couple - yet again a middle aged, overweight couple dry humping and grabbing each other on stage.  We all became disgusted and hurried to finish our drinks.  We all agreed to leave.   On our way out the birthday boy asked to speak to the manager - he complained about the waitress and then asked about a free birthday cover.  The manager said that if you let them know when you are in line then yes you can get in for free.  They do not advertise this so the birthday boy asked for a refund for his cover.  The manager would not comp him.  He stated that they do not give refunds.  This manager needs to work on his customer service skills.  It was his birthday afterall - why be a dick and lose business?    I can't see myself coming back here ever."}
{"text":"I stood outside of the Shout House on a Saturday night waiting for my friend to arrive. Honestly, the lyrics in the songs that I was hearing while I waited almost made me want to suggest a different place. But my friend was the birthday girl, so I figure just suck it up and go with the flow for once in your life Ameerah.  Once inside, I noticed that the crowd was...how do I say this... friendly?! Shocked, very very shocked by this. Never have I been in a place in Glendale, where I didn't at least get half of the room giving me a dirty look or some trick bumping up against me on purpose just to start shit.   A lot of Vikings fans were in town that night, which may have accounted for the general niceness, and were so chill. Some ladies allowed us to sit in the seats their coats were hanging on so my friend could eat her food while we enjoyed the entertainment. And they were just dancing and carrying on conversation the entire time, one was very drunk, and made for some entertainment all on its own.  Another huge shock, I knew a majority of the songs that the entertainers were playing. Don't tell my cousins back home, I'll never live it down, they already still joke about me being square and this one would just floor them.   So yea, I had a great time, drinks and food were a bit on the pricey side for an unemployed student like myself, but good none the less. Service was pretty good too. Very quick food prep for how packed it was in there that night.   Now, I know my reviews recently have been focused on nightlife and I don't want you all getting the wrong idea about me, I normally don't party out this much. So just take your 'party-girl' label back right now!"}
{"text":"Loved the fiddler and all of the piano players  the reason I gavel tars was that they water down the drinks"}
{"text":"Whatever happened to a real dueling piano bar? They sing the same 'ol songs every night and don't ever change it up. It's perfect for after a hockey game when you've already had a few and can sing just as obnoxiously as everyone else.   I would be scared to eat the food. The service is super slow. Maybe the food is good if you drank too much and can't taste anything anyways."}
{"text":"If you like the Big Bang...you will like the Shout House. Biggest difference is FOOD! That's right as you enjoy your slow service and live entertainment, you can actually nibble on something. I personally prefer it over Big Bang for this fact. I ned somethign to line the stomach as I enjoy a drink, and if I am going to pay to get into a place I like it to be a one stop shop."}
{"text":"Too loud.  Nuff said....just pass the Excedrin."}
{"text":"Pro: drunks singing, public insults, friendly atmosphere   Con: upstairs  Came here late hour wondering Phoenix solo on a business trip, stumbled upon this gem by chance. I already know the Shout House well from the SD location... and wouldn't you know it, one of the player on the piano was on loan from SD.   So, drinking and singing, I managed to get a song in (part of the your world)... too bad it was a weeknite and the place closed early.   Next time I am in Phoenix, I would be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Cover Charge Was Too Expensive. Drinks were very weak.  one of the piano players, Sam Ferguson... What a detroit punk... We had to pay him three times to get one request up and I am talking at 10-15 bucks a pop.  My advice to anyone going there is to sneak in a flask of whatever your drinking, DO NOT PAY SAM FERGUSON FOR ANY REQUESTS!  James Brown and Scott Doyle are the best.  Complain about the cover charge."}
{"text":"I should preface this by saying that I have not been to the shout house for the piano duel; this review is strictly for the restaurant.   We came here before a PHX coyotes game and the shout house happened to be the only restaurant around without a long wait (that should have been a sign). We were seated quickly, but were given a very limited menu: the Game Menu. With only a few options, we ordered a burger, chicken fingers, a caesar salad, and nachos. It took over 45 minutes to receive our food even though they weren't crowded. The food was poor. Nothing stood out and it wasn't worth the money or the wait.   Our waitress was nice enough and apologized for the wait time. She expedited the bill before we even got our food because she knew we would be rushing to the game. However, the customer service we received from the other staff was far from average. As we were finishing up, someone else (another server, a manager, I'm not sure), approached our table and asked if we could move because a large reservation was coming in. I told her we were leaving in a couple minutes and she seemed unsatisfied with this response. She was rude, the food was bad, the wait was unjustified: I will not be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Spent my birthday here a few weeks ago, but had a large group so making a reservation was top priority. After browsing their website, I was thoroughly confused on their Reservation Policies. I sent an e-mail, but didn't hear back so ended up just calling and getting everything cleared up. I was a little weary still, but ended up making the reservation. On their website, it states that you have to submit your final headcount by 2:00pm on the day of the reservation, but after a couple e-mails and phone calls, there was no hope. I ended up calling right as they opened and was able to add 4 additional people.   Once we arrived, they showed us to our tables and we were all together and close to the stage. Our waitress was great and kept up with all of our drink orders. 2 of the pianists were not very good or funny, but the other 2 (whom have been there for quite some time) were outstanding as usual. We stayed for about 3 hours before heading to the next place.   I highly recommend making a reservation for groups of 3 or larger on the weekend as the place fills up very quickly and there is not a whole lot of standing room available."}
{"text":"The last time we tried to go here, the Bouncer was not at his post, we walked by and he quickly called us over then proceeded to eyeball us and give us extreme attitude!!!  Lay off the juice! We went in and waited for 15 mins and no one came to our table... We left. I would never go here for any reason! But girls are Drawn to this place, this Place and Chevy Trailblazers... Go figure!"}
{"text":"i had a rockstar time at the shout house!  i attribute my fun night out at shout to these factors:  1.  no cover.  always a plus!  2.  there were actually seats available!  quite a discovery on a saturday night *yay*  3. the wait staff was readily available, a HUGE improvement from another bar we had been at earlier, where i waited 30 minutes for drinks.   4.  the music was for sure fun.  and as a glee fan, i appreciated them doing \"don't stop believing\"...apparently i'm not the only one, cuz the WHOLE place was singing at the top of their lungs.  5.  ppl being embarrassed on their birthdays don't typically entertain me, but remember this phrase if you go, you will shout it out to every birthday boy/girl who ends up on stage.  ready?  this is it....\"you bitch, you slut, you whore!\"  yeah...always fun to belittle ppl you don't know.  6.  the TRANNY-TASTIC bathroom attendant.  i have to wonder what this crazy asian lady is doing moonlighting in the bano, with her suitcase full of goodies.  mayhap she is just trying to find her place in the female world...it felt a little wrong to have someone who looked THAT much like a man kickin it in the ladies room.  and lastly...  7.  SHOT GIRL!  so this girl (and i mean GIRL...she looked like she was still in high school) wanders the floor with her jello shots and whipped cream, conning ppl into taking shots and sucking the whipped cream from between her boobs, off her neck or from the inside of her thigh (ugh, the memory made me throw up in my mouth).  it was like a TRAIN WRECK...i didn't wanna stare, but couldn't look away.  why, oh why, do women pay to watch their middle aged husband/boyfriend suck/lick whipped cream off this little girl?!  i wouldn't want my husband doing it...ESPECIALLY not in front of me!  and as a nurse, i think that it might be unhealthy to eat whipped cream off a girl's INNER THIGH...srsly, it might as well be on her v-jay-jay.  plus, you aren't the first one...i know she isn't using baby wipes in between men.  enjoy those germs, perverts.  disgusting, and yet entertaining."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go but the drinks are pretty steep and sometimes weak for what you pay. Definitely going to give you some laughs and it gets better as the night progresses. Have fun finding parking too. If you come during a night where there is a coyotes game be prepared to pay $20 to park within 1 mile of the place. But all of my gripes are settled when I leave after a good time"}
{"text":"Lots of fun!  Went after a Coyotes/Blackhawks game and had a great time.  Mini burgers were delicious, our server was terrific, the beer was cold and the entertainment was silly and engaging and kept the crowd in it every song.  Thanks Shout House for an unplanned night of fun during our vacation!"}
{"text":"I am telling you, with the people I was with Saturday night, we can make any place rock. My time at The Shout House was tons of fun, but I don't think it had anything to do with the place itself.   I was appalled at the cover charge...I HATE COVER CHARGE!  Luckily I was with a party, so I didn't have to pay.  Felt bad for others. I ordered a Greyhound...which was all grapefruit juice...no vodka at all. My food was good.  Nothing great.  (Just a regular burger and fries) My friend had a Veggie Burger, which she said tasted like cardboard.  The server was very accommodating (and agreed with her) and changed her order to a salad. Now there are 4 musicians that rotate...we could tell who the \"stars\" were...2 of them plan out sucked and had a hard time getting the crowd going. (Even after the Cardinals game was over)  One of them was an obvious 80's hair band has has has been. The other two, Travis and blah can't remember his name, were very entertaining.  I have to admit, though, that Travis sounded like Weird Al Yankovic. It is great for birthdays....especially for girls who like to get their boobs fondled.  I had to put in 3 requests for my friends birthday before they got to it.  (Of course they had no problem taking my friends money) Will I go back again?  Sure.  Only with my group of friends though."}
{"text":"I live this place. Great drinks. Awsome entertainment!!!! Not for the faint of heart. Profanity a plenty. But oh so Damn funny. The singers will commemorate engagements, wedding anniversaries, birthdays, and promotions (for a tip.)  Such great interactive fun."}
{"text":"Now this is cool. You pretty much get a free show. Just show up, drink a few beers and enjoy the performers.  Not bad actually. This was my first shout house experience. And this place is huge. Lots and lots of seating. We were there on a random Thursday night and there was a very small turnout. But still, that just means more seating for the rest of us.  The bar area here is pretty big too. And they have random specials on a daily basis. The servers looked hot too. Not bad...not bad at all.  So come here for some adult comedy slash music and also enjoy some really good eye candy."}
{"text":"Dick Jokes + Piano = Class  Such is the equation that makes Shout House so cool. Granted, I'm a good 10 years too young to hang out here. The cover of Vanilla Ice was foreign to me, and I didn't know the lyrics to the Duck Tales theme song well enough to sing along. But still, people were getting mighty drunk (on a Wednesday!) and still having fun.   On Wednesday nights, I randomly came in, and after a couple beers found out the glory of cheap well drinks until 10pm. The bartender is a champ; mine were poured perfectly. Me and my friend just perched up on the balcony, watching shenanigans ensue below. People sure know how to party.   The Yelp special for burger + beer seems pretty cool, and this is totally a place I wouldn't mind eating. If you didn't bring your \"No Fear\" tee shirt or five inch heels to Westgate, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I needed a break from our usual pregame spot so we ventured into Shout House for a few drinks before a Coyotes game.   I can't speak for the cover charge or the food, as there wasn't one and we didn't eat on this visit, but the drinks were great. I ordered a specifically made margarita and the bartender made it perfectly. Their single malt scotch was also only $6.50, best deal in town if you ask me. With a fiance that drinks that stuff like water it was very kind to our wallet!   When we showed up the door guy didn't give us a warm and fuzzy feeling, it was a quick hello then he was quick to inform us there was a wait for a table and that food was going to take 25 minutes. Okay? I think I am capable of observing that it was busy. All that those comments did was make me feel unwelcome. But we had trekked up the non working escalator to get there so we weren't leaving at this point. We just wanted drinks anyway, so we headed to the bar. I have to side note though, there were about 10 open tables and 25 minutes for food when it is busy isn't ridiculous, save your breath buddy and just say hi if you cant be any more upbeat.   Overall had a good time enjoying our couple of drinks at the bar and watching the piano players banter back and forth. People didn't seem to into them at the time, more concerned about stuffing their faces and getting on to the game, but they really tired to get them involved."}
{"text":"Located in the entertainment area just outside U of Phoenix Stadium.  Great for tailgating and having a pre- or post-game meal. Not a big deal that it is up on the second level. Actually, I would prefer that, gives you a good view of the plaza below.  And it was great on this particular day, just before the Cards/Rams game. We all went with the Fish and Chips and we all thought they were pretty good, though not great. Atmoshere is great, service by Joseph was very good and we enjoyed our time here.  It is a good sports bar alternative to the overcrowded restaurants down below."}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn awesome.  The pianists are very talented and energetic. Downfalls: The drinks are a little expensive and we almost got thrown out because we needed to \"calm down\" when one of the songs we requested got sung. I guess I am used to the Big Bang where they encourage loud singing and dancing. Everything else was great for a bar setting."}
{"text":"Super fun but always packed, Cover sucks but ya know"}
{"text":"Visited in early December.  We beat cover and got a great table.  They absolutely rake you on food and drinks.  We planned our visit with every intention of eating dinner and drinking there all night, but no go.  I asked about bottle service for our table to avoid having to try to communicate with the waitress when the place started to get loud.  She didn't know nor was she interested in find out for us.  Ich.  Drinks and food were concert venue or amusement park prices.   The Piano players were constantly asking for suggestions but throw your request on the floor if it doesn't come with a tip.  Would be much easier to have some little sign or primer of 'how things work'.    The premise is fun and the guys were really entertaining, but that's it. There is no such thing as comfortable seating in a place like this, and be prepared for the guys on stage to single you out if you catch their attention.  And they won't be nice."}
{"text":"Overall we had a lot of fun, our waitress was great, staff very accommodating... once we arrived.  We almost did not go, because we thought they might have closed down.  They take a long time to acknowledge emails, and I called several times, twice between 7-8pm after they opened, they don't answer the phone!  I left 2 or 3 phone messages.  NOT ONCE DID THEY CALL BACK.  I knew they were still open after they finally replied to one of my emails.  So I made the reservation.  It looked like they charged my card when they said they would not, and true to their word, it was not charged, but it WAS confusing.  And there was no way to cancel!   That is a problem, especially when  you don't answer the phone!      1.  Learned about Shout House  through Groupon.  After buying I tried multiple times to call, left 3 messages, no one calls back OR ANSWERS the phone!  It took 3 days for my email to be replied...and no one ever returned my 3 phone messages.  EVER.  I thought they might have closed down!  Then after putting up my credit card Friday for a Sat. reservation, it was over 24 hours when they replied back (by email) that our 7:30 arrival time was all set.   2.  CHECK FIRST if Westgate has an event - Parking was awful and we had to pay $20 just to park.  The event last night was a monster truck show, not a game.   3.  Menu downloaded from website has changed:  They no longer carry the healthy options like Kale Quinoia salad or Chicken Ceasar salad.  The cheesesteak flatbread was awful, bland, low on meat, high on processed cheese and soggy white bread.  Sweet potato fries saved the day.   4.  Piano guys are great!  Talented, entertaining and the place over all was really, really fun!  Too much foul language, too much time on celebration 'shows' to embarrass the birthday boy or celebrator.  Why do they encourage these folks?  It takes a few minutes to coax them up, then they draw it out way too long!   OK, one song or few minutes onstage, that's fun!  But 10-15 minutes of one fat guy showing us his belly, then grabbing his butt, then back to the belly.... ugg, they sing another song or two and call up a newly engaged gal to sit on piano, you could tell she was ready to be done after 2 minutes.... but they drrraaawww it out....   and I just want to hear more Billy Joel!      Overall we did have fun, but for us, the crass behavior they encourage, especially so early in the evening (we left at 9:30), the language that is not necessary, and the sparseness of the songs we enjoyed I doubt we will try again.  Too bad, because it really is a lot of fun to sing along, and SHOUT!  Oh  and don't let reviews of bad service turn you off, the staff is GREAT!"}
{"text":"$8 / pp cover starting at 7 pm on a Saturday. 20 minutes until we were even greeted by our server. $12 for a Stoli martini. 100 decibels of loud, though not particularly enthusiastic, piano bar standards.   The numbers don't lie, this place is pretty lame. Looking for a sing-a-long piano bar experience? Head to Tempe where you'll get more 'Bang' for your buck."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this bar. It's so fun and friendly and great for entertainment, drinks, and people watching. This bar attracts a great crowd and sure does involve the crowd in the entertainment. Wish there was more room for dancing though. Tables seem to take up the whole place. It's always packed and never a disappointment. The big ass beer is huge and the drinks are made well. Great customer service majority of the time. Funny musicians with musical talent as well."}
{"text":"Music is good. Fun place to go. Service is okay but the waitresses have too many customer to handle at once. The cover charge is a little too much. The bartenders are horrible. Ever watch Bar Rescue and see what horrible bartenders do? They pretty much do the same thing. For instance, when they use the cocktail shaker they flip the glass around and use it to drain. The glass has their dirty hands all over it and now all of that is in your drink. Nasty. Drink bottled beer cause you know it's not tainted..."}
{"text":"Love this place. Piano bars can be lots of fun. Go with a group sing, drink, have a good time. The last few times I've gone the crowd has been pretty small. Hope this place doesn't end up shutting down."}
{"text":"We're in town for the National Championship game. They got us in and out quickly. I had the wings and a Caesar, both we very good. Service was prompt and friendly and the music selection was fabulous! Also loved the art .... nice black and white canvas selections of musicians .. Billy Joel, Stevie Nicks, etc."}
{"text":"I had an okay time here, the pianist were entertaining. It was pretty empty and I was shocked by the early close. One of the piano players, older gent, looked like he rolled out of bed. Wasn't really what I was expecting."}
{"text":"$8 cover for guys; free for the girls on a Saturday night.   For a Saturday night, the place was not packed.  There were plenty of tables on the side and the bar wasn't really that busy. The entertainment is great though and it's something very different, something I don't really see in the Bay.  The guys are pretty talented.  They can sing and play different instruments.  The girl on the violin was pretty cool too!  Overall: This isn't my kinda crowd, but I still enjoyed it.  It looks like a mix of college and older folks.  It seems like a weird combo, but then again, I'm in AZ, so what do I know?  Apparently, this is how the West Side rolls (according to my friend)."}
{"text":"Always a fun time here in my opinion and never priced too bad.  The entertainment is great.  My biggest complaint is that no matter when I go it's always about 1/4 to 1/2 full.  Sometimes even less full.  I wish they could get more people in here."}
{"text":"I went here before the Chargers/Cardinals pre season football game.  There was a 2 hour wait at Saddle Ranch and Margaritaville, and it didn't look too busy upstairs, so we checked it out.  There were plenty of tables, but the place filled up quickly.  They had a special that included a cheeseburger and fries with a beer for $9. Can't beat that! Unfortunately, because all of the tables arrived at the same time, our service was very slow.  Our poor waitress was a bit overwhelmed and it easily took 20 minutes to get anything we asked for.  Once ordered, our food came out quickly and was very good.  It is a dueling pianos bar, so it is pretty loud, but that is to be expected.  One of the performers seemed to be losing his voice, so he didn't really sound too great and kinda made the other guy do most of the songs."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun! I love the dueling pianos and singing along to all the old and new music."}
{"text":"We were there for a company holiday party.  Our server was on the ball with everyone and courtese as well as assisting her regular tables.  The food was great and the entertainment was a blast.  The requests for songs moved quickly and there was a wide variety.  The employees seemed to enjoy their jobs and showed it by keeping everyone involved and the atmosphere in the packed facility moving and upbeat.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"It's a piano bar. If you have seen one, you have seen them all. With that being said, if you HAVEN'T then you are in for a good time. The sing alongs are goofy and fun, and the BIG ASS BEERS are plentiful, and well, big."}
{"text":"Oh where to begin? I rolled in here with some friends prior to the bears game. My sentiment is slightly toasted so I'm in a generally amicable mood. We spot a pit of tables in the center of the place and grab a table. There's a few scattered tvs and they're all half as big as they should be and all showing the same game. The menu in front of me has 5 items and it looks like a lunchroom menu for 6 year olds. Of course you know I ordered the chicken fingers with fries. When in Rome right?  It took 20 min to even flag down some semblance of a server and even then he was none too exited to oblige. What came next is not some glowing review of taste bud delight. Someone defrosted chicken tenders bought in the frozen food section of your local market and served them over the worst fries ever. Soggy and burnt.   Don't get me wrong. I'm in a chill mood but this food isn't good enough for a pet. If you go to the shout house, shout for help first."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place, but I'm not a big fan of their 10 dollar cover charge.  I guess I can look at it as paying for the entertainment because I never get close enough to the stage to tip.  Although, I have noticed that there is not always a cover, and sometimes it is cheaper, but I can't remember when all of that crap happens.  Basically, you've got a big split level room (extremely dangerous stairs for drunks) with a really long bar on one side, a tiny bar on another, and a slightly raised stage up in the front.  The place is always packed, and you've got to fight for seats sometimes.  I hear they serve food, but I never get it.  I would hate to have to depend on a waitress.  Tip: just go to the bar to order drinks, don't waste your time with a server unless it is early on in the evening.  The music is a lot of fun.  They take lots of requests and put a piano spin on all of our favorite current songs.  For birthday people they embarrass the hell out of them, and if the person is female, crazy raunchiness WILL ensue.  They tell lots of dirty jokes, sing filthy songs, and swear a lot.  This place is definitely not for the easily offended or the prudish.  I love it all, and it cracks me up.  My favorite part is when the staff gets up on the bar and on stage, and sometimes on the pianos and starts doing some weird choreographed dance.  It's a lot of fun, and sometimes the hot guys take off the shirts and the girls engage in pseudo-lesbian action.  A little something for everyone.  Bottom line, it's a lot of fun and everyone should go at least once."}
{"text":"It's bar food. Who cares. The place is a lot of fun. I always walk out with a smile on my face. FANTASTIC Friday Happy Hour. 50¢ beer and a free buffet of \"snack food.\""}
