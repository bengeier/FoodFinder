{"text":"I'm really not qualified to review a restaurant because I don't have any expertise in this field. This is really my 2nd post and I will only post based on serious issues found in the restaurant service industry. To the point, Kitchen claimed (on the menu) that an item, namely the mushroom soup contains NO meat or poultry based products and IT ACTUALLY DOES.  It was written that the mushroom soup was a vegetable base. Only after my mother-in-law questioned it, the server told us it was actually a chicken stock base. I would have never thought to ask but bless my mother-in-law, she has to check everything based on religious dietary requirements and I happen to be pescetarian, When the server revealed the truth only after we inquired, his response was \"yes, point noted, I guess we should change that.\", with a really bad attitude as well.  Do not support Kitchen, this is a good reason to shut these guys down."}
{"text":"Ridiculous prices for microscopic portions; even with groupon it didn't make sense. Nothing tasted good. Random menu. Only one waiter and he was not attentive. It was an unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"Can't believe there were no reviews for this restaurant. Let's get started!  The inside of the restaurant had only a few tables, but was quite spacious so it didn't feel overcrowded at all. We must have waited 30 minutes for the food to come out even though there were only 3 tables, but the overall quality was worth the wait.   Complimentary bread was served cold with whipped butter. It was certainly soft on the inside but super tough around the edges (cut into my upper palate)--would have tasted better had it been warmed up, but did not end up eating it in the end to save stomach space.   Am happy to report that the Shrimp and Salmon Linguine (between $18-19) was quite delicious. Linguine was al dente; still pipping hot when it came out. The only drawback was that there were only 3 pieces of shrimp but enough perfectly cooked salmon pieces to redeem itself in a \"creamy\" tomato sauce as advertised on the menu. Personally, I would have preferred the sauce creamier, but it was not bad.   My SO couldn't stop babbling about how delicious the Slow Stewed Short Rib (between $29-$32) was. The meat fell apart easily like the texture of pulled pork. You could tell it was marinated very well and slow cooked for some time to lock in the flavours. Tasted pretty good with the mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables it came with.  Both portions were perfectly sized and we walked away happy on a full stomach.  Note to the business: Please update your menus because there are no longer Shrimp and Scallop Linguine which was the only thing I came for.  Overall verdict? Parking was difficult to find but the food was delicious even though it took a long time to come out. Will definitely return to try other items. Hopefully by then the menu would have been updated online to reflect accurate dishes and prices so that when customers arrive they are not shocked to find discrepancies."}
