{"text":"This is the best patio spot for a mild spring sunday. Food was good enough in the neighbourhood as you are enjoying bright daylight in the glasshouse!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here food is fresh and tasty staff are nice.  Nice selection of pizzas and pastas and grilled selection.  The hamburger gusto and tuscan fries are really good so are the salads if you want light fair.  Good place for lunch."}
{"text":"The carpaccio was delicious, as was the gusto salad & pizza. The drop-peppers on the salad were what made my meal! So delish. Atmosphere was nice, but my only complaint would be that there is not enough shade on the patio. Started breaking into a sweat after a few minutes of sitting in the direct sunlight and had to ask for a shady table once it became available. Overall good service, albeit a little slow, but understandably so since it was super busy Civic Holiday Monday."}
{"text":"Arguably the best italian food in Toronto. Terroni a close second.  The kale salad is probably the most commonly ordered lunch dish and for good reason. If you're a meat lover, get it with steak and you'll want it again for lunch the next day. Best pasta dish is probably the bolognese and the Lunedi' Polpette Di Carne (lamb and Cumbrae's ground beef meatballs, tomato sauce, stracciatella, herbs, grilled tuscan bread, olive oil, and maldon salt) is my favorite dish.  Always the best wine and the best bread I think I've ever had which they of course make from scratch.  Great atmosphere. Best in the summer when they have the garage door style window wall open and the patio bumpin.  Pricey but reasonable for a high end italian restaurant in downtown Toronto. Always worth it.  Great for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I LOVE Gusto, I go fairly regularly with my girlfriends...Thursday nights sometimes the line sucks but the kale salad and the mushroom pasta are worth it!!! Also dollar an ounce wine obviously helps! I tell everyone I know to go here!!  This is the first night I have had an experience that really made me think I wouldn't come back/recommend (and more realistically I'll probably come back, but just be jaded...as the pasta is that good)   Worst off it had nothing to do with the food! 6 friends and myself went for a dinner and when the bill came we opted to split it as some of us had a few drinks and appetizers while a couple didnt at all so we figured it wouldnt be fair to just split the bill...so I did the math thinking it was better than asking the server to (though considering I used to be a server for 9 years I know how easy it is to split bills....but I don't what system they use...anyways I digress) so I split the bills with a generous tip and we walk out....and the server runs out after us!! which is obviously kind of embarassing for a couple of reasons I realize this is so server specific, but she tells us we didnt pay our bill fully...so I went back in (redoing the math in my head the entire time) and stood there while she searched the trash for a receipt (so embarassing when you are surrounded by people) and she finds a bill that she \"misplaced\"...then she says she thinks its ok.....so I asked her to add it up and stood there...  I didnt walk back into a restaurant to be embarassed for no reason on the chance \"its fine\" so I waited until she tallied it only to realize we gave her over 20% (good considering she wasnt special at all, or even very attentive....did I mention I am also an accountant- you can't doubt my numbers) and was like oh you are right...didnt even expressly apologize or anything it was just such a bad taste to leave a restaurant in when you have only had great experiences....all in all I would recommend, but service is not guaranteed (mushroom pasta is always a guarantee...just be warned)"}
{"text":"Food 4/5 Service 4/5 Atmosphere 5/5  Food: came with four girlfriends, shared four dishes. 1. Thursday special: grilled lamb rack. Best dish of the night, lamb wasn't too gamey and went very well with the assorted julienned veggies. 2. Malfalde ai funghi (recommended by our server): pretty good, barely any mushrooms but a lot of truffle oil, so the aroma was great. 3. Rigatoni bolognese: average, nothing special. Pasta was made a little overcooked, which I preferred. So for people who like their pasta al dente, it may be too overcooked for you. 4. Polpette pizza (meatball, mozzarella, smoked provolone): a little difficult to eat because its thin crusted. It's the type of pizza you have to fold to eat, but it was hard because there were chunks of meatballs on it. The taste was good, but I probably wouldn't order again.  Service: Went on a Thursday night, wait was 45 minutes when we went at 8. There's a bar upstairs where you can get drinks while waiting. Our server was nice, but she didn't tell us the specials right off the bat. There was a special for white wine. $1 an ounce of wine on Thursday, which is always nice for a girls night out. But we wouldn't have known if we didn't ask about it ourselves. They were very patient with us though when we asked for recommendations. Although, her recommendations weren't that helpful. She seemed to just have recommended everything we picked already, but we needed help picking an extra dish.  Atmosphere: Loud but romantic. The venue opens up to the patio area. The space isn't big, even a little crowded but it's decorated with walls of wine. We sat on the patio, which was more quiet. However, it was really dim outside. A little extra lighting to look at our food would have been nice. Inside is more lit and appropriate for a romantic date.   Would definitely come back for drinks and to enjoy the atmosphere. Wouldn't necessarily come back for the food."}
{"text":"As happens so often in Toronto restaurants, great decor, quirky, unprofessional service, grossly overpriced wine and mediocre food. Nothing quite wrong, but nothing quite right (except the groovy decor). Looks better than it is."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service & atmosphere!  I have been in Toronto for a week and have already been here twice.  The pasta is home made & spectacular.  The staff is the BEST ever!!!!"}
{"text":"I think Gusto may be one of my favourite restaurants in the city. The ambiance is always so fun and boisterous but I don't find it too loud. You feel like you're part of a scene there and everyone seems to be having such a good time. That may be the $1/oz wine on tap - which is not bad at all! The rooftop bar patio is a great place to spend a summer apres work. I don't love the no reservations thing but I believe for a larger group there is some accommodating.  For food, I love the kale salad and I'm not generally on the kale bandwagon, the spinach pizza with ricotta is fantastic, bolognese is rich and filling in a good way, and the meatball pizza is a nice change to the usual salami. For lunch I also like having the kale salad with some shrimps or chicken on the side.  Sister restaurant Nervosa in Yorkville is equally good food but the environment is lacking in comparison."}
{"text":"Really great place to sit down for lunch with a group, whether it be inside or out. There's a ton of natural light in the restaurant and the overall feel of the place is welcoming.   The food is great! Some would say the portions are a little on the small side, but the taste makes up for it! Wouldn't mind coming back!"}
{"text":"Best mojitos and the carpaccio is to die for!!!!been there twice in the last month and already wanna go back again."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Went with colleagues the other day and had octopus, bruschetta and pizza. All delicious. The rooftop patio was really nice for a summer's day. I would give it a 4.5 star rating - I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Top floor is my favourite patio downtown. The food is consistently great (Italian). Downstairs is a bit tight - much prefer upstairs, especially in the summer when the patio is open.  Great place to bring guests."}
{"text":"Came here 3x on Friday nights. Excellent food, $1/ounce wine, great location. The upstairs sky lounge has such a different vibe from the downstairs. My suggestion is if you're going with a bunch of friends and you're planning on staying for a while, get a table upstairs - it's worth the wait. Downstairs is nice too but it does feel dark, crowded and chaotic. If it's nice out, the small heated patio out front is also an option. Service is your typical King/Queen West hipster style - super casual but friendly. The hostesses are understandably overwhelmed, it must suck to tell 25 people waiting at the door that it'll be another 1.5 hours before they can get seated...and your full party must be here."}
{"text":"Amazing. Definitely try the kale salad. A new way of Italian including our  newer foods (and healthier) like quinoa (in dessert, amazing!), kale and the sort. Wasn't in love with the homemade wine, but it was acceptable, and at least you have options!  A refreshed look at these healthy foods and Italian food. Again, AMAZING!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the \"it\" restaurants in King West, and the food quality is stellar!! I've had Italian food at many places (good and bad) and this one is definitely up there. Their pizza is traditional oven-made, and their menu seems to lean on the healthier side (ex. kale) - which most women love.  In terms of space, their rooftop patio is definitely the highlight, especially during nice weather. The only thing I would recommend is improve their customer service. Be prepared to wait during busy times. It's a popular restaurant."}
{"text":"I will never stop coming here for the Mafalde ai Funghi!!!! I don't even like pasta that much but it's my absolute favourite dish in the world. Their house wines are decent at $1 per ounce. The other go to when I visit is their kale salad. Really nice to cut the richness of the creamy pasta. I am obsessed to say the least."}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance and amazing food.  I had their burger, which was pricy but so worth it... Gf had the mushroom pasta, which she said was \"just ok\" because it wasn't hot (hence -1 star).  Would definitely recommend. And I will be coming here again to try out more of their food."}
{"text":"Like the decor in this place.  Reminds me of the NY vibe.  Went with two friends who both enjoyed their meals.  Mine was good, but I'm writing this review over a month later and can't remember what I had (one friend had the mushroom linguini which I had a taste of...yum).  If you come there earlier you can definitely luck out on a table; it also helped that it was freezing out that night."}
{"text":"Quick review:  Food: Delicious.  Service: Really great service, the staff are really attentive and actually engage in conversation  with the diners! Negatives: We had a party of four and they wouldn't seat us until we had three people present (even with a reservation) which was really annoying because it was packed and we had to wait crammed near the entrance of the restaurant!  Atmosphere: Busy on a Saturday night!  Overall: Great service and good food - I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Ambience: 9/10 Food: 6.5/10 Service: 10/10  Gusto 101 is a nice place. The interior is very industrial and unique. I came here last night around 7pm and the place was packed with more people waiting in line. The crowd is very mixed. I'd say this restaurant appeals to both the old and young crowd. It's my first time coming here and I expected a little more for the food.   I got to try the meat ball, bruschetta and the margarita pizza. It was okay. None of these dishes particularly stood out to me. I had high hopes for the pizza because I was expecting it to be authentic Neapolitan.   However the service was great and food came out quickly. Over this place was okay."}
{"text":"GO TO TERRONI's!!!  I threw a 20 person private event at Gusto on Sat Nov 30 2013. It was not up to the standards we expected for a private party.  The service was slow and sporadic. I had to physically walk upstairs 3 times to find a waitress/waiter to assist. Definitely not worth 18% gratuity.   The water jugs were left empty and my guests were always thirsty.    Besides the kale salad which was pretty popular hit, the pasta and pizza were not impressive. The steak selection was particularly mediocre.   We have hosted our 20+ people dinners at Terroni's and we will be going back to them due to the disappointing service quality & food at Gusto 101."}
{"text":"This place has AMAZING food and drinks. They have $1/oz wine, and I would say it's worth more than that. You get a great value. One of my favourite dish is their Cavolo Nero. I also like their Margherita pizza. The restaurant is always busy. So if you have a group of 4 or more you should get there early or try to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Great place to come with friends. Food is quite good as well. Their pizza is thin crust and was quite delicious as were their pasta dishes. The covered patio is one of my favourite features (but I do dislike having to take the stairs all the way downstairs when needing a bathroom). It is pretty in every season and it feels like you are outside but in fact it is warm and covered. It is a casual place, trendy with good food and drinks and a perfect place to hang out with friends/coworkers, casual date, etc."}
{"text":"Excellent meal love the ricotta appetizer good choice of vegetarian and wonderful atmosphere - excellent service but limited wine list"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great and the whole place smells absolutely delicious right when walking in. I came with some friends for brunch and I had the Uova in Camicia. So delicious but next time I would substitute the salad for a soup if I can. We also had the pancakes and I would have to say that they were slightly dry because there was no syrup given to you. All in all, I would come here again because I heard the dinner is fantastic."}
{"text":"I think this is the first time I finally went to a place I bookmarked to try!  We walked in last night at 7:45 pm and immediately got a table for two.  It gets an A for ambiance (even though you are packed in) and service (even though my server who was at least ten years younger than me kept calling me sweetie).  I thought I was a fairly intelligent person, but I had to get our server to translate a number of items.  We started with: Mozzarella di Bufala - tomatoes, basil oil, parmigiano crisp, smoked paprika.  Light and tasty.  House wine: delicious.  I had the: Da Dee - sweet potatoes, cavolo nero, local fior di latte (I had to get it translated and found out it is a sweet potato, kale and two kinds of light cheese pizza).  Too much kale on a pizza!  I am not sure I would order this again.  My friend had: 10oz Striploin - dry-aged, certified Angus, cannellini al fiasco, chipotle sauce steak.  The beans were not very tasty.  The steak was good, not fatty and very tender - it was medium done.  We shared what I will call a dessert sampler, because our server said something in Italian that I can't remember.  There were two mini vanilla cupcakes with chocolate icing (tasteless), roasted marshmallows with strawberry sauce and this cute syringe filled with rum that you can baste them in (tasty) , a chocolate-caramel creme-brule that was so decadent and yummy!  I was disappointed because I had high expectations for the restaurant but I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  I will definitely go back and try the pasta menu for dinner as well as lunch and brunch.     I would also love to get a seat at that table downstairs in the wine cellar..."}
{"text":"Expect a long wait. It's worth going once even if it's a little pricy.  Nice patio. Very limited selection of beer. Drink menu is expensive. None of the plates we ordered were out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"It was a nice atmosphere,  a bit on the loud side. Customer service was excellent but the food was so-so.   My friends and I ordered a whole bunch of items to share so we can try different things. The only dishes worth mentioning is the grilled octopus and the kale salad (this was actually really good, we ordered seconds). We ordered 2 pizzas and I don't really like how they make them."}
{"text":"Beautiful inside and the most delicious kale salad. Can be veganified by removing the cheese and is still just as amazing."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious food. I always want to try new restaurants but why bother when you know what you love :)"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice, food is ok but the service is terrible.  It was a 30 minute wait for a glass of house wine. All the while wait staff is standing around socializing!"}
{"text":"I typically try to avoid going for Italian food at all costs, but not if it's Gusto! Always a go-to, the food is always great, good service, and despite being busy the wait is bearable. The house wine is $1 an ounce and you're not sacrificing the taste. I've taken so many people here and never once has anyone had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Service: Good, kind people and the manager was great  Drinks: $11 for momosa  Food: We get the Mafalde ai Funghi and octopus which are delicious. The mushroom pasta is soooooooooooooo good. We went at 11:30am on Sunday and it was suppose to be brunch only however, our menu had the pasta section which we ordered. The restaurant was accommodating and when it took an hour to get our pasta, they covered the cost for the inconvenience.   We also tried the cocoa bowl which sounded quite simple but very delicious. Note this is pricey at $14.99.  Price: pricey, but great ambience   Parking: There is parking right beside the restaurant which is about $10 when we went on the weekend.  Recommend: YES, wouldn't come that often since it is pricey but once in a while it is good."}
{"text":"This place was aaalright.  Apps: OMG get the bruschetta. Its not like regular bruschetta....its melty. And the salad with the bufalo mozzarella...wow. Amazing flavors.  Pizza: The pizzas crusts were amazing. I got the Da Dee which is sweet potatoes and kale....I thought I would like it more, but it was definitely not my favorite. It was lackluster in flavor but it was worth a shot. My husband had 2 pizzas (big eater). He was the one with the blue cheese and cured meats. It was very salty but very flavorful....again, not our favorites. The shining star was the polpette which was loaded with cheese and sauce and MEATBALLS! That was very yummy indeed.  A nice feature here was the 1$/oz house wine which was really very good!  Dessert: We had the biscotti....dont get it. Its 1$ for two tiny rounds of biscotti. You don't even get the whole thing and that was super disappointing.   Service was great.....very attentive and the place itself is GORGEOUS! Really fun place with parking right next door (bring cash for that) and go on a sunday (its not crazy busy)"}
{"text":"Awesome dinner & restaurant!  Staff was very helpful fitting us in on Easter without a reservation. The kale salad was a terrific starter & we were very pleased that dinner came with a nice spread of veggies. P.S. we also split the burger which was also superb."}
{"text":"On the top of my faaaaavourite restaurants in Toronto.  I am absolutely biased by the fact that this is on the delectable Portland Street.  (On a side note, if I can get a place to live on this street then it will keep me in TO longer!!).   Entering Gusto is like embracing a cocktail of your Dad's shed, Aunty & Uncle's vineyard, a menu that is your Grandma's goodness-meets-your-holistic-dietician's orders.  Oh...did I mention the cute as sin bar tender that comes in the shade of ash?   This spectacle alone will have you begging to wait for your DTE waitress.  I love that they treat everyone with a personal touch.    Gusto makes me want to quit my corporate job and simply be in the space!  They're great with big groups and small. Brunch, lunch, dinner, supper...   Dine before hopping across the street to Spirithouse.   A Hammer review."}
{"text":"Tried the salmon, kale salad, and mushroom tagliatelle. Salmon was smokey, sweet, salty... perfectly cooked. Tagliatelle was rich, well seasoned and with a satisfying hit of truffle. The stuff of future cravings. The kale salad seems to be known far and wide across the city, for good reason. It actually makes me like kale!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious. They have the best Kale Salad, and everything else I had was amazing! Service was good, but at night the upstairs was quite noisy, so it was had to hear everyone in my group. Drinks were good too, and the waitress picked out an excellent wine with dinner."}
{"text":"The kale salad with Chicken breast is better then sex. My girlfriend and I go every Sunday and order this salad and it is yet to disappoint. I love it so much that I wish the chef would come to my house daily and make it for me. Whenever I'm not at Gusto I'm wishing I was.  I am not exaggerating this salad is seriously ridiculous. On a side note I have also tried the grilled octopus and it is delish but it aint no kale salad."}
{"text":"I was really excited to go here. But I was thoroughly disappointed and this is why:  I went for brunch there with my sister. Right off the bat, they couldn't accommodate my request to substitute the prosciutto (which came with the poached eggs) with something vegetarian (I suggested tomatoes). Apparently, they don't do substitutions. Fine. So the server suggested I order the Eggs in Purgatorio, which is vegetarian. It looked good, so I said sure. When they came, the eggs were so underdone that the whites were still clear. So the server brought me another one and the eggs were STILL undercooked. It was supposed to come with smoked fontina cheese on top....no cheese. So when the sever walked by, I asked if it was supposed to come with cheese (showing her that there was clearly none). She told me \"There WAS cheese...on the top.\" I'm not an idiot. I know what cheese tastes/looks like. There was no cheese! The whole experience was such a bummer! They didn't do anything to remedy the situation, so we paid full price - 50 DOLLARS (!) - for the meal. I spoke to the manager after who tried to justify why the eggs were under cooked, which angered me even more! It's too bad because I just moved the the neighbourhood and was looking forward to having a sweet, trendy place nearby. Unfortunately, they won't be seeing me, or any of my family members, again."}
{"text":"I used to love Gusto, but my experience this past weekend made me feel like this super busy spot in the King West area might now be riding its \"hot\" location and not focusing on the food like it used to. To be clear, nothing was offensively bad. It just wasn't great. My friend had the mushroom pasta, which appears to have become Gusto's one trick pony. She said that it was very nice, which my other friend and I could not say about the pizzas we ordered. I got the spinach pizza, which had a nice enough crust, but which was disappointedly bland. It wasn't due to lack of toppings, as there was a ton of spinach and cheese. There just wasn't...flavour. I ate 3/4 and didn't even bother packing up the rest.  As usual, the wine was a great deal at 1$/ounce.  The service was fine in terms of our waitress. I didn't like the fact that she brought us the bills without first asking if we needed anything else - eg a refill of our wine. But nothing to be fussed about, as she was friendly throughout the night. The hostess seemed tired and agitated - fair enough, it was busy and she was being pulled in all different directions.  I'm not jumping to go back to Gusto. There are too many options for good Italian in Toronto."}
{"text":"Continuing my trip around the Mediterranean, this week Nathalie and I were introduced to a pleasant Italian eatery: Gusto 101. At first glance, it seems like a quiet hideaway, especially considering it is the former home of a mechanic shop. However setting foot inside, you realize just how alive the atmosphere is.  The lighting is dim and the decor is simple, but I find it adds to the charm. Design elements include copper, steel, wood and glass - keeping close to their roots as a mechanic shop.   Upon entry, we were promptly greeted and taken to our seats. Not one to be offended by the use of mobile phones by staff, it was pleasant watching our server take our order on his virtual notepad - an iPhone. In fact, every member of staff in the restaurant is equipped with electronics to enhance your dining experience. Nathalie and I ordered Beef Carpaccio ($13.95) to start, Da Dee Pizza ($15.95) to share, and a Crostata ($5.50) dessert to fight over for. Spoiler: I won.  While waiting for the food, lighting guides your eyes to various decorations - or, as I like to call them, conversation starters. Heavier lighting accents a wall of fresh bread, the open kitchen, and a few Ontario Motor League signs. Some of the bread was brought to our table to entertain us until our dishes were ready. Dabbed in olive oil and balsamic vinegar, the bread melted in the mouth. If only that bread basket was bottomless...  Shortly after, our food came. The beef carpaccio was paired with a salad composed of kale, beans and pecorino cheese. The beef carpaccio itself was perfectly seasoned with lemon, olive oil, and pepper. While I am not a fan of kale, I was surprised to find it complemented the beef carpaccio well.  Next came the pizza. All of Gusto 101?s pizzas are personal sized and thin-crust, in other words: the traditional Italian way. Our selection was topped with sweet potatoes, kale, caramelized onions and pecorino cheese. Unfortunately, it wasn't enjoyed as the crust was too thin and soggy; it could barely hold up the toppings.  Last but not least, the Crostata dessert finished off the meal. It had an interesting texture to it, combining crostata almonds, chestnuts, fudge and shortbread in a way that captures all the flavours together. The dessert is small, so if you plan on sharing it, make sure you grab the bigger spoon!  For a quick trip to Italy without ever leaving Toronto, Gusto 101 offers traditional Italian dishes with a twist, as well as a wide selection of wines, cocktails and other alcoholic beverages to suit everyone's taste. Find it nested between King and Adelaide, on Portland Street, accessible by foot, car or transit (501 King). Ironically, this mechanic shop has no room for cars, but nearby public lots will accommodate you - for a small fee, of course.  Price: Average $40-50 for two"}
{"text":"I ate here late on Saturday night.  It was about 10:00 pm when we arrived.  We were seated immediately at a small table for 2.  The place was hopping, if you needed a bigger table there probably would have been 15-30 min wait.    We asked what the best things on the menu were.  The waiter recommended the octopus and the carpaccio for starters and the gnocchi di ricotta and the branzino fish for mains.  I have a problemo with mains at most restaurants.  I find the flavor and pizazz to be majorly MIA in comparison to the starters.  But we thought we would give mains a shot again, I usually order 4-5 starters for the 2 of us, but we went with exactly what the waiter suggested.  This was the very best carpaccio I have ever had.  And I usually order carpaccio everywhere I go.  The octopus was so tender and smokey, I love it.  I would have a hard time not ordering these 2 items the next time I eat here.  The mains were as expected, a bit boring.  The fish, I wouldn't bother.  The gnocchi was supposed to have pork sausage, but I couldn't find it or taste it for that matter.  Ended the meal with the dessert trio (tiarmisu, chocolate pudding and a lemon froth thing), even though we only wanted the lemon one, the waiter talked us into the trio.  But then when it came, they were out of the lemon.  Seriously, I couldn't believe he actually brought us 2 desserts we weren't really interested in without checking with us once he found out they were sold out of the one we wanted, but they were surprisingly very good.  All in all, I enjoyed the restaurant and would go back.  The waiter told us they are getting a roof top patio ready that can seat close to 75 or so people plus a small out front patio."}
{"text":"Solid Italian. Went on a Sunday night, so it wasn't as crowded as we expected. We were able to make reservations about 2-3 hours in advance.   We shared the mushroom pasta, margarita pizza, and the squid ink risotto. They were all above expectation for the price. I personally like their $1/ounce wine they offer.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"One of my fav spots! Charcuterie s little lacklustre but fungi pasta, grilled octopus and kale salad were mind blowing! Gusto never disappoints. Really cool concept. Old garage door and signs. Really cool ambiance. Definitely recommend if your looking for a relaxed vibe but awesome food."}
{"text":"There's always a buzzing crowd when I walk by Gusto 101 which has deterred me from dropping in for the longest time. After a meal here, I can certainly see why they're so popular.  What went in my belly:  Wine on Tap - $1/oz... doesn't get any better than that! I love that you can get your wine in any increment you want.  Cavolo Nero - lacinate kale, zante currants, toasted pine nuts, pecorino & lemon vinaigrette ($13.95). Great combination of flavours - sweetness from the currants, a bit of nuttiness and some citrus from the lemon vinaigrette. A must-order for kale fans.  Fettuccine ai Funghi - Portobello, porcini, oyster mushrooms, truffle paste, light cream sauce ($17.50). The pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente and the sauce had a wonderful deep and earthy flavour. The portion was also quite substantial. It tasted great for lunch the next day too.  Ricotta e Spinaci Ravioli - ricotta cheese, spinach, parmigiano, white wine, tomato sauce ($16.50). A tasty vegetarian filling and a nice tomato sauce. My only complaint would be that the pasta itself was a tad bit hard in texture but nevertheless, it was still a great dish.   Branzino alla Griglia - Mediterranean sea bass, fregola, escarole, spicy tomato jam, citrus emulsion ($27.95). An absolutely gorgeous dish that tasted every bit as good as it looked. Highly recommended if you don't feel like eating pasta or pizza.  Dolci Platter ($15.50) aka the dessert platter. This was the only misstep of the meal as we didn't find any of the desserts particularly memorable.   Despite the disappointing dessert, we still had a great time at Gusto 101. They've got two great patios, delicious food and you really can't pass up wine on tap at $1 per ounce!"}
{"text":"Finally! There is a hip, yet classy restaurant in Toronto. Gusto has become my favorite go to place on King, ever since I had discovered it early this summer. The experience at Gusto has always been the same: super friendly staff- real human interactions and not robotic \"hi, what can I get for you?\" , lotsa healthy options - kale salad is a must try as well as roasted potatoes!  Yum!  Oh and the young and cool crowd.   Everything about this place is unique, even the unisex washrooms. I love the reactions of men everytime I go there! They think its too good to be true! Some wouldn't even go to the washroom, because they wouldn't believe that it  really is Unisex.   The only downfall is that Gusto is almost always super busy. So we either make peace with it and wait for a table ( which takes at least 30 mins) , eat at a bar or make a reservation ahead of time. As simple as that:) A place like this is worth waiting for."}
{"text":"Get the Mushroom Fettucine and don't look back.  It's a serving fit for a hangover and you won't need to eat for the rest of the day.    Their pizza is phenomenal (Da Dee - sweet potatoes, lacinate kale, local fior di latte, caramelized Spanish onions, pecorino, rosemary - PHENOMENAL), definitely get it instead of the 8hr braised beef, polenta, gorgonzola, rapini (it was great, but other menu items are better)."}
{"text":"Great ambience, good food & wine, reasonable price...and very cool staf!!!  My suggestions:   As a starter: the char grilled octopus is a must!  Pasta: Roasted pumpkin Ravioli.  Pizza: The Polpette (meatballs)  And I would recomment sitting at the bar and asking for \"Jorge\", he was great!"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times but have never been blown away by their food.  Came once for brunch and a few times for dinner. Brunch was super underwhelming to be honest.   It's a very cool spot but at the end of the day the food just didn't cut it in my books. I guess I had high expectations given the other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great decor. I just love the smell of the place and absolutely wanted to order everything off the menu. My only comment would be that the food took a little longer than I hope for over a lunch hour. Would definitely go back for a dinner when I can enjoy a glass of wine with the meal."}
{"text":"Wine per oz is a good deal. Other than that, you're paying to be seen here, and that's about it. Took a client here for a lunch meeting as they loved Italian food, and it was a bit disappointing. The food is nothing special, not worth the price, go to buca if you want good Italian food. You want to be part of the scene, then this is the place.   On a sunny day, it's a nice place for a drink."}
{"text":"I recently held my son's wedding rehearsal dinner in the private wine cellar at Gusto 101.  Every aspect of the event was handled with perfection, from the initial contact with the event coordinator Alessia several months ago to the set-up of the venue to the actual night itself.  I am beyond impressed and pleased with their friendliness, helpfulness, quality of the food and service.  Alessia was so helpful and accommodating, making sure everything was perfect.  Our server for the evening, Benjamin, was also fantastic, the perfect combination of professionalism and friendliness.  The food was delicious with very generous portions, I couldn't be happier, thank you Alessia, Benjamin and Gusto for helping make this a very special evening.    Sue Rutledge"}
{"text":"Went here for a work dinner last Thursday and loved it! The food is very delicious and the service was excellent. Love the glassed-in upper floor. I agree with other reviewers, it is very busy and gets quite loud, but it wouldn't prevent me from going back. Really enjoyed it. Good for going with a group. Interesting people watching, positive vibe. Recommend it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I anticipated Gusto since last winter, watching it get built whilst sipping Americano's at Jimmy's.  And alas, it is hands down one of my favourite restos in Toronto. Been there several times and it consistently delivers. Great menu.  Open kitchen.  Fun and busy vibe.  Wine on tap - hello!?!   Service is cool, unpretentious and knowledgeable.  Love it.  Washrooms are even cool, and for me, if the restaurant is great, but the washroom sucks, I don't return.  All in all, a win-win.  And now that the hype of the new kid on the block has gone down, the wait, if any, is now reasonable.  Went in on a late Wed night in December.  Was told the kitchen was closed as we sat down.  Boo.  But the waitress quickly chased us down before we left and said the kitchen would stay open for us.  Amazing.  Great scene, any night."}
{"text":"Okay, this is a prime example of my issues with Italian restaurants.  I lived in Italy for a while and my ex-boyfriend's mother is a flipping genius as an Italian cook so I know what good Italian food is my friend. I cannot stomach overcooked pasta, I literally gag and if a pizza is a little too Pizza Hut/Pizza Pizza I can pretty much sniff it out.   I went here in the summer, and yes the ambiance is good. Let's face it, most of the people here are just here for the meat show so if that is what you're after than you will get that in spades at Gusto.  The food, however, is not nearly as impressive as the short skirts and nice packed jeans! In fact, it's really not that great at all. The best part is the $1 oz wine (if you don't mind mediocre wine). I ordered a pizza, because that is my specialty and quite frankly it's much harder to cook a good pizza Italian style than it is to cook some pasta or meat. It's a true test of whether or not this person actually knows what the hell they are doing in the kitchen.   The pizza was mediocre! It wasn't vomit inducing but a Terroni or Via Mercanti pizza kills this floppy pretender! My friends ordered a salmon dish that looked good but was not authentically Italian (came with quinoa, come on!), and my other friend's pasta was not impressive.  In brief, if you want to check out a bunch of singles from the financial district pretending to be hip and cool on a Friday night,  this if for you. If you actually want to eat good Italian food than this is not."}
{"text":"GREAT brunch with a twist on classic breakfast dishes. Can't wait to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here. Order the kale salad or the salsicce (sp?). their salmon was delicious. Also, love the staff."}
{"text":"I've been to Nervosa several times before and so coming to Gusto 101, I had the same expectation. The decor is very loft-like with high ceilings and rustic/industrial theme to it. This place gets super packed and the first time I visited here for dinner, I waited an hour.   I had the Risotto al Nero ($18), which was a squid ink risotto. This dish was pretty good but obviously since it was squid ink - my mouth turned all black and I basically looked like I lost all my teeth. A friend had the Funghi pizza ($18) and that was very flavourful and very good. Compared to Nervosa - I think this was a bit better than their mushroom pizza.   It's very very loud and very busy but it's a nice vibe. Pretty decent service but long wait times."}
{"text":"Gusto is my go-to italian restaurant in the city. It has a nice atmosphere that is great for dates. The food is always delicious. The house wine is $1 per oz.   The menu at Gusto changes from time to time. I think they offer very similar dishes, but mix them up a little bit from time to time. Last night, I had the bolognese pasta dish. It was so so so delicious!   I like Gusto much better than Terroni because: you never have to wait for a table (or never have to wait long for a table), the food is equally as delicious but you get bigger portions, and the wine is cheaper! I would totally recommend this place to anyone :)"}
{"text":"Atmosphere - This places has a rustic modern decor and a decent buzz due to the open setting with tables relatively close I one another.  Great for a dinner with friends or a date night.    Appetizer - The curried butternut squash and pumpkin soup was a great starter on a cold snowy day in Toronto.  It's the kind of soup that sticks to your ribs, nice and hearty.  The goat cheese and roasted pumpkin seeds added a nice layer to the overall texture.  The soup wasn't overly curry flavored, if anything I would have preferred more of a kick, but it was quite good and I would definitely order it again.    Main Course - There was a decent variety on the menu but I narrowed it down to the rigatoni with braised lamb.   The pasta was cooked perfectly.  The tomato sauce was very fresh and bursting with tomato goodness.  The braised lamb was very tender and mixed in with the rigatoni, complimented the dish nicely.  A few olives added to the sauce added a welcomed salty edge and the thinly shaved pecorino cheese brought the whole dish together.  Drinks - I loved the fact that this place offers a house red or white for only $1/ounce!  Wine connoisseurs might want something else, but if you are looking for a decent glass if wine to go with your dinner the red and white definitely do the job."}
{"text":"If it were just the food, this place would get a five-star rating easily.  I went for brunch, and the food was aaaaaamazing.  Like use-your-fingertip-to-scoop-out-the-last-bits-of-sauce-from-your-bowl amazing. We shared the mozzarella antipasto to start, and it was sheer perfection: a fluffy cloud of buffalo mozzarella with rich, oily pesto and the most shatteringly crisp parmesan cracker on top. It was a great combination of flavours and textures all around.  The service, though, left a lot to be desired.  The servers are knowledgeable and the kitchen is fast, but the host tried to sell the place as a bar/club by bragging about \"the sexy ladies that party here in the evening!\" to my male dining companions more than once and the server tried to clear our plates before we were finished several times.  The last time, she grabbed my friend's knife before she realized he still had food on his plate, and he had to finish his meal without it.  We didn't stay for dessert even though we had planned to--we ended up walking to Dufflet to get something there."}
{"text":"I came here because a friend recommended it when I spent a weekend in Toronto and I am very glad I did. Not everyone gets pasta right but Gusto definitely does. I had the mushroom pasta ( Fettuccine ai Funghi ) and I am so upset I'll have to wait till my next trip to get some again. The pasta was cooked to perfection, the mushrooms were rich in flavor and the meal came together so well. The place itself is really nice and inviting, but service was a bit slow, hence the one star deduction."}
{"text":"Good service and great food. I was there about brunch time and really enjoyed my meal. Had a very cool server - and the music was good too!  Just one thing - we sat at the bar and although the chairs were cute they were only comfortable for a short time...."}
{"text":"It can get very busy, very quickly and I can see why. This place is my go to romantic date night with boy or catch up with the girls kinda joint. It is intimate despite being busy and packed and the food is really simple and classic. What draw's me to this place though is there surprisingly good dollar per ounce house wine. The group usually settles on a pizza or apps to share and just go about drinking for the rest of night, enjoying each others company. It's really quite a special place that I've enjoyed all the times that I've went. My only complaint is that service tends to be inconsistent. Some times I'd get very attentive and friendly servers while other times I've been served by a waiter that barely came to check on us. Nonetheless, I keep coming back because who can say no to cheap wine and decently priced italian food?"}
{"text":"We came to Gusto for a quick catchup dinner with one of our junior high school classmate during my bachelor trip here in Toronto. It was a busy Sunday night but we were lucky to find a table for 6.  I debated profoundly on rating for a 3 or 4, but at the end it was the many little flaws that had tip the scale.  To begin, Gusto was a spacious restaurant with seating available both indoor and out, and a base hosting for additional tables. Yet the owner must had been too greedy by filling up the place with tons of tables and chairs over the capacity limit and at the same time forgetting about the open kitchen and bar that took about half of the inner restaurant. Thus, customers were cramped at the tiny tables with elbows almost touching elbows. For the night, our group of 5 guys and a pregnant mom was gathered around a small rectangular table, sitting on high stool like chairs with no backs to hang our heavy coats which we had to stuff in to the compartment below the surface of our table creating such inconvenience.   Being a Chinese and by far foreign to the Italian culinary arts besides the usual common red/white sauces, bread and cheese and olive oil, pasta, pizza, and the pitiful not-even a handful of wines that I knew of, the few excellent restaurants that I had the pleasure of visiting in NYC had given me the precious insight on the fact that the physical size of serving dish were usually large regardless of the portion within. Gusto was no different as tradition and fashion would had to be followed, practiced, and copied. Before coming to downtown, earlier in the day we had a huge and fantastic dim sum brunch at a Chinese restaurant near our hotel area, and thus we were kind of conservative on the dinner choices. Unlike the other companions who had chosen two orders of linguini, a lasagna special, and two pizza pie, I ditched entree and instead chose calamari and a cocktail called tempest. After the usual round of bread with olive oil given by the restaurant, our food arrived in numerous white plates. Both the lasagna and linguini dish size had taken more than 2/3 of the table's surface area, and the two pizza pies (about 10\" each) took almost all of the remaining space. At this point I would have patted myself on the back for only choosing an appetizer and a drink. But no, as I had stated before where fashion would need to be copied and followed. The golden rings of sliced calamari heaped up in a tiny pile that was served in a tiny little white rice bowl along with a spicy mayo-based sauce for dipping. To make presentation pretty, the chef mounted both sauce and meat on a wooden little tray that you see commonly used in Japanese restaurants when serving individual sushi and sashimi, and completed the dish with a streak of chocolate sauce for garnish. So what could have been compact was now a size of regular dish that would need to compete for space, awful.  As everything in Gusto was cooked fresh from open kitchen, there would be no complain from me in that department, but yet amid all the pizza and pasta that I shared with my friends, none seemed to stand out, and tasted plain and average to me. The pastas were a little undercooked for my definition of al dente, and for the way over priced pizzas the pies were so thin with thickness equivalent of two dimes stacked together. Living here in NYC, I had way much better pizzas and much cheaper pricing. We finished our dinner with 2 orders of a combination of lemon tart, chocolate flan, and chocolate covered cream puff. The square blocked lemon tart was excellent, bursting with sharp sweet lemon flavor, and the chocolate flan was gooey with rich and delicious chocolate. The puffy puffs were average, having had much better ones at so many Japanese bakeries.  Many of you, after reading this review, might say that I am too picky and too harsh on Gusto. But hey if I am to pay for meal and service, then I expect to receive the best of the best to get my money worth."}
{"text":"I am in town on business and came here on a recommendation from my hotel.  I was not disappointed. I had rigatoni bolognese and a side of sautéed greens.  We ate on their outdoor patio.  The experience was pleasant, relaxing and the food was very good.  Just what I wanted tonight."}
{"text":"I love the look and feel of this place, as well as the location. I've been here a few times for brunch and dinner.   I've never had to wait for a table for brunch. The space is huge and there's lots of open air in the summer. Going here is a great excuse to have prosciutto for breakfast! The frittatas are nice and fluffy, and the scrambled eggs are ok. I think this would be a nice choice for a big group.  This place gets packed at dinnertime, and it's a fun place to meet up with people for drinks. The food is fine and the prices are reasonable, but none of the dishes I've had were very memorable."}
{"text":"This hipster place has cool decor all around and a rooftop.  Very hugh quality food good food all around. Came here again and was not disappointed.  pricey however.    burgers kale salad the squid and pizza are all good choices here. great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yum!  I went her with a good friend of mine. We split the Tuscan fries, that come with a spicy marinera/ketchup. Really yummy  She order the seafood pasta and in her own words its the closest that seafood pasta has come to the best seafood pasta she has ever had in her life in Boston.   I order the Da Dee Pizza which is sweet potato, kale and caramelized onions. So delicious and I felt great because I felt I was being super healthy.  They serve a small bread basket with olive oil on the table.   We didnt stick around for dessert because we had a show to catch but I will definitely be back. It loses .5 star only because I felt the food wasnt hot enough when it came out and became cool rather quickly."}
{"text":"Wow! Went here on a Friday night with a group of 5 and had no wait at all. We ordered the chefs special tomahawk steak and loved every bite. The selection of meat and squid starters were fantastic as well. Really lived the place and will return soon!"}
{"text":"Great food, good service.  Book ahead and avoid peak times if you can, this place gets BUSY.... but the food is great and the service is professional.  Top features are the wonderful rooftop patio, house wine sold by the ounce, and their awesome private basement room for family-style meals."}
{"text":"Food are pretty nice while the service is a little bit slow since there are many customers inside. The fungi pasta is  pretty flavourful and perfect in texture! The fish is crispy for its skin and tender inside, the zucca is mild and creamy for its filling but become more flavourful when it is tasted with the roasted nuts on top. The salad is on the normal standard."}
{"text":"This place has a nice vibe I would say trendy young/ affluent city crowd. Great ambience!  It can be loud though on the weekends so keep that in mind. I really enjoyed my meal and appetizer,  I would say this is the place to go on those friday nights where you feel like going out and being in a place that really has a trendy alive vibe"}
{"text":"Delish fun place. Great kale salad. Good wine great staff. Always busy with a buzz. Good for groups upstairs and downstairs and patio."}
{"text":"It's nice to find places downtown that have good food for decent prices. I personally am not the type to like places that you pay $60/plate and you end up going mcdonalds at the end of the night. First off atmosphere and decor are really nice, it feels trendy like you could just go for some drinks and aps upstairs before going out. Service was fine and as everyone has mentioned you definitely can be not go wrong with the $1/oz wine. It actually is decent.....On to the food... I had the octopus app and braised beef which is a special on fri. The portions are a good size. Octopus was great... Cooked nicely was a little charred which is how I like it (you get that bbq flavour) braised beef was soft and flavourful. Nothing was the best thing I've ever had but I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I think the venue is great pretty trendy and ambience was nice too. Great selection of unique wines and the food was tasty."}
{"text":"I recently had dinner at Gusto 101 and as per usual the food, service & ambiance was great. I have been there a few times and each time ordered something different. I can honestly say everything I have tried tastes great! The staff is friendly and attentive. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"4 out of 5! One of the best Italian places in the city! Fantastic house red wine ($1/oz) every time. I recommend the Fettucine ai Funghi And Rigatoni Lucani"}
{"text":"Awesome place - great décor, funky atmosphere.  We were there early in the week, so wasn't as hopping as I understand the weekends get to be.  All the appetizers and entrees we had were beautifully prepared - and the $1/ounce housemade wine was surprisingly good!  Unfortunately all 3 of us who dined there (and ate different things) all experienced tummy problems when we got home, so.......not sure what that was all about.  Service was very good - all the waitstaff and bartending staff are very attentive and cordial.  I will give it another try and hope that was just a once-off thing."}
{"text":"Cavolo Nero, Gusto 101's famous salad stands up to the reputation.  Organic kale, pecorino, pine nuts Want protein kick, savour the polipo dish.  Grilled octopus, olive tapenade & fried capers.  Do try the new Ananas colada cocktail. Amaro, coconut cream, spiced rum, yum yum! A Great way to end as a dessert also.  Feeling adventurous: Hamburger al gusto, topped with mushrooms & aged cheddar and a must side of Tuscan fries! What we love? Hipster King west vibe, friendly staff and wood oven pizzas too!  #gusto101 #ladieswholunch #kingwest #yummyformummy #Toronto #torontosaladtour @gusto101to"}
{"text":"The mushroom pasta is amazing if you like a heavy mushroom flavor. Kale Salad was super delicious and would definitely get this again. Pizza amd Ravioli was normal."}
{"text":"We waited an hour and a half for a table at Gusto- it's conveniently located next to Bier Markt so you can stop in there for a few rounds before your table is ready. They will text you when the time comes- a service I wish more restaurants had.  The atmosphere was decidedly uncomfortable. I stopped in with friends after work (business casual) mid-week and we all felt underdressed for some reason. What the heck? I don't really get the ambiance, but that wasn't why we were there...  I have heard a lot of great things about the kale salad- I saw a lot of people order this, but unfortunately did not. Instead I ordered the mushroom pizza. It was ok... Nothing spectacular, and not a lot of flavor. We all ordered different varieties of pizza and sufficed to say that there is not a lot going on in this department despite having a rather extensive list. After waiting that long to get in I just expected more from Gusto. Would return but only for kale salad."}
{"text":"I love their pasta with fungi. I've tried a few things and they've all been good but this is my favourite. Restaurant has a good vibe, and good location for going out after.  Always a solid go-to option in King West, whether as a couple or with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Bucatini was a disaster. Noodles were good but the sauce was a horrible mush of muddled flavours. We didn't come close to finishing the dish, even though both my date and I were hungry. Trout was very bland, best part were the lentils on the side. Service was flippant and perfunctory. So many better restaurants in this city, I wouldn't waste your time on this one."}
{"text":"We came in during brunch time and had Fettuccine Funghi ($17.50) and Pizza all'Uova ($14.95). The fettuccine was so good as others reviewed. We liked the sauce especially. The pizza was in their brunch menu and had egg and prociutto. It was ok, but we rather wanted to try another pasta. We were seated upstairs and it was really a good place for brunch on a beautiful weekend. Our server was very kind and attentive. We would definitely come back for dinner."}
{"text":"I went on a friday evening around 7:30PM and waited around 20min to get our seats. (Heads up: they dont take reservations beforehand for the busy evenings & weekends). We ordered the spicy pizza and the truffle pasta and loved it.  The spicy pizza (ask your server for the name) was really unique and the flavor was something that you can't get in normal pizza / italian restaurants. There's nothing more else to say than it was cooked right, so it tasted right.  The truffle pasta was very good, albeit similar to other pastas we've had before at italian restaurants. I think it's hard to go wrong with this choice and I was told it's their most popular one. The only downside is that being two asian girls used to spicy and saucy dishes, it was a bit creamy after we've started to eat it, so we couldn't actually finish all of it.   The server made sure all of our needs were attended, despite being a busy night. He was friendly and made the dining a good experience. I loved the ambiance as well.  Overall, I would come back to this place :)"}
{"text":"So I have to say that I am a bit of a regular at Gusto. This is probably my favourite place in the city for a drink and a bite. The best is sitting at the bar. If Jorge is working, he is my #1 bartender in the city! My favourite things in order:  1) $1 per ounce wine that is not bad AT ALL 2) Funghi pasta and the margarita pizza - YUM 3) Ambience - if you want a boring restaurant, not the place for you  What I am basically saying is GO TO GUSTO!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely well-designed. The entrées could use a little beefing up thing if you know what I mean. Portions are small, prices are a little above average but they are definitely big on taste. Service is excellent however it lacks some intimacy when crowding too many people in one space. Good for dinner and definitely somewhere to be seen but i'm not sure what all the hype really is about. I would go back but not regularly."}
{"text":"This place has great ambiance but the food was only okay on average. The pizza I had was very flaccid and greasy- would not order again. The desserts (we split a few) were amazing."}
{"text":"The food was tasty (I've had both the steak, and one of their pizzas), but I wouldn't say it blew my socks off.  The place feels trendy and has a great vibe. The staff are great.  They make their own wine, which wasn't bad at all and is very cheap to buy ($1 an ounce).   I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The wait was long. Food presentation and the roof top patio was really good. But the overall experience was pricey"}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto. My trout was excellent. Wait staff was very nice and helpful. Water bottle never went dry! My family's pizza and ravioli were also very good. Very loud inside and hard to hear conversation."}
{"text":"Arrived on Wednesday and it wasn't as busy as when I tried to come here awhile back, so if you are interested, try to arrive on a weekday!  We order the seafood linguini and the sausage pizza which after tax and tip was $45 total.  Price is in line with expectations for Italian food.  Service was splendid, bread is provided and the water bottle that was provided was changed when it was 25% filled or less remaining without having to ask.  Food was very quick (probably took roughly 10 minutes after ordering).  Atmosphere is okay, it is dark inside and fairly noisy.  You may end up sitting pretty close to your neighbours due to how the layout is, so be warned.  Overall, nice experience, I enjoyed the pizza, the pasta was okay."}
{"text":"I walked in and looked around. The first thing I noticed was the amazing aroma and plenty of room for people to sit. Great ambience as well. Staff was friendly.  I didn't want to give a high or low rating because I only stoped in this time, I didn't eat there. I was with friends and didn't have time. I do plan on going back though. Actually, I'm looking forward to it. The pizza looks amazing."}
{"text":"I think i have already reviewed this place but feel it is worth a second one. I went there for a second time on the weekend. I am really torn about this place. The establishment itself used to be an old auto shop of some sort and its really has that vibe to it. very funky decor. They use ipods to do all of the ordering. The food is good.  The Bad.... Their staff have NO sense of urgency. They go at a snails pace.  yet have all the time to gab to each other. The ipods even if they are ordering food there is no way that they needed to spend that much time on them.  My table was next to the open concept kitchen. We had lots of time to kill so we observed.... the Executive Chef had an obsession with touching his face especially his mouth, and I caught him licking something off his finger then eating something.... this guy touches my food... sooo gross. Also there were 2 plates of food that sat under the heat lamps for a good 15 min... I am hoping it was a staff members and not a patrons meal.   All in all I will probably still go back because i do like the place but I was extremely disappointed this time...."}
{"text":"Gusto 101 is the newest and latest hotspot to take on the King West neighbourhood.  The space, an old mechanic's garage has been completely transformed into an open concept kitchen with exposed bricks, high ceilings and dim lighting.  The only problem is they don't take reservations and the restaurant was jammed packed full of hungry patrons.   After an hour and 15 minutes and 1 glass of prosecco, we finally got a table for 2.   The owner Janet Zuccarini of the Yorkville resto Cafe Nervosa is the owner and also designed mainly the dinner with Italian classics and favourites brought over from Nervosa.   For starters we had the funghi appetizer which was served in a le creset pot mixed with arugula and bread crumbs - it was savoury and flavourful.  We also tried the buffalo de mozzarella antipasti with roasted grape tomatoes and a parmesan crisp which was refreshing.  For our mains, we focused on getting pastas dishes - I had their ricotta gnocchi with pork sausage.  This was an incredible dish where the gnocchi's were like pillows of air that melted in your mouth.    My friend had the roasted pumpkin ravioli which was sweet, creamy and very velvety.  Delicious!!!   We did want to sample Gusto's own wine by the tap -Vini di Gusto- but they were sold out!  This wine is house made in the restaurant's own basement and is a branch of Toronto's urban winery Vintage One.   It's definitely a fun spot to have a great dinner with friends or on a date on.  I look forward to going back and sampling the vino as well as when the rooftop patio opens up above the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing lunch today at Gusto 101. We ordered an avocado toast as a starter to share since we were hungry but it didn't come for 35 minutes! On top of that, our mains came a minute later! They must have also rushed prepared the toast because the server that brought our mains also brought another order of avocado toast (which he took back).  Adding insult to injury, he only brought 3 out of the 4 mains so I didn't get my meal for another 5-10 minutes.  Our server (Fatima) apologized and said she was occupied elsewhere and that the other server that brought our mains forgot my plate.  The restaurant was only 1/2 full upstairs where we were sitting so I don't understand why the service was so disorganized.  Food wise: Avocado toast - tasty but some of the bread was burnt to a crisp Uova in Camicia (eggs bennies) - the dish I ordered, spinach under the eggs was cold but that could have been because it wasn't delivered on time Tagliata di Manzo (steak and eggs) - no complaints here Mafalde ai Funghi (mushroom pasta) - salty Diavola (spicy pizza) - not spicy"}
{"text":"Go here, it's good.  Yes, all the staff think they're better than you, they probably are.  And just like every restaurant in Toronto worth going to these days, you have to stand around like a dick waiting for a table at peak times.   Just deal with it and enjoy your meal. Or don't.  You'll be missing out on a really nice space, with a couple of great patios and a pretty good buzz.  They have wine on tap! Wine. On. Tap.  And it's completely passable, better than most of the swill offered as house wine elsewhere.  The food is great, decent burgers, tasty pasta, nice crispy neopolitan style pizza's, and the fresh mozzarella is incredible."}
{"text":"The place was kind of hipster. It was nice and felt cozy, we sat upstairs where we could see outside through the big windows. The service was prompt and the server answered my questions about dishes and helped me make a decision.  I ordered the mushroom pasta (Mafalde ai Fungi), and my fiancé had the Bolognese di Bisonte e Manzo. They Were both delicious and very flavorful, but that mushroom pasta especially has us dreaming of going back!  Before the main course we also ordered an appetizer of Polipo (grilled octopus) which was also extremely delicious. It had many different flavours incorporated into the presentation on a wooden slab. This included chimichurri, capers, arugula and others.  To drink we ordered some of their house white wine which was also good. Lastly, they also included a candle with the Dessert I ordered since it was my fiancé's birthday. Great place, worth every penny!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this restaurant for special occasions since it's extremely loud inside, but it's a decent spot to give a try on a regular day. Our server took a while to come take our order, but the food was prepared and served extremely quickly which was a nice change. The mushroom pasta (Mafalde ai Funghi) and the calabrese salami pizza (Diavola) tasted great, but sadly the Tuscan fries were gross. The fries were soaking in oil and compressed into a small can, definitely not worth the $9 it costs. Maybe this place would get another star if I hadn't ordered the fries."}
{"text":"Looove the environment. Perfect place to go for dinner with your friends. The Fungi pasta is AMAZING. For appetizer def try the \"arrancini\". The patio is also pretty good for both winter and summer.   I have been to this place many times and literally every time I was told the wait list is between 45 to 1 hour. However, they will alwaysss call you within 20 minutes. I still have no idea why do they tell people that the wait time is too long when in fact it is not. Also, make sure you get there before 10:30 so that you can enjoy the full menu. If you go later you will get a late menu which is mostly pizza and salad."}
{"text":"I went to gusto last night with two friends. We were seated right away and promptly brought water.   Our waitress asked us if we wanted bread to start and we said yes but it never arrived. We ordered the Bruschetta Guanciale e Taleggio and Tuscan Fries to start. Bruschetta was definitely a winner and was topped with a piece of bacon, and the fries were nicely seasoned and came with a spicy ketchup. We obviously took advantage of the $1/oz wine and ordered glasses of both the red and white between the three of us.   For our mains I had the Fettuccine ai Funghi and my friends had the Ricotta e Spinaci Ravioli and Spaghetti Chitarra allo Scoglio. The Fettuccine was delicious with tons of mushrooms and a hint of truffle and was definitely a very healthy portion size.   Overall experience was good, our waitress was attentive (minus forgetting the bread) and the food was delicious. The atmosphere is very rustic and warm and I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"One of the best and most consistent Italian meals you will have!  The funghi pasta is to die for!!  Great atmosphere with great food! Can't go wrong with that!!"}

{"text":"On the insistence of my SO (she has been back since our first visit) we dined at Gusto 101 again. Long wait times as it is still a very happening spot in King West, but the hostess were very polite, honest, and accommodating. They had their house wine available on our visit this time, we tried both the white and the red. White was pretty standard but we liked the red as it had good floral hints and accompanied the food we ordered very well. Tried their kale salad, delicious. Funghi fettuccini...best plate of the night and would highly recommend. Also tried their pizza which was ok but didn't really leave an impression on my mind. I would be back and would try more of their other pastas and/or have a drink and just take in the atmosphere of King West."}
{"text":"I have only visited Gusto 101 once, but I definitely plan on returning. The cozy and comfortable restaurant space has a great vibe, which makes for the perfect place to catch up with some friends.   I have only tried their Mafalde ai Funghi pasta and the Prosciutto e Rucola pizza, but I have no doubt that the remainder of their menu is fantastic. In addition to the food being phenomenal, the service is extremely friendly.  Gusto was a full house the night I dined in and so you might have a bit of wait, but it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"The place has a nice patio however I ended up eating almost in the same table of a couple who sat next to me which is kinda uncomfortable. The service is below average and slow except for a young lady who was really good and with good attitude. The food is OK. The arancini are good, a third one would't hurt though. I ordered a Estate pizza which was OK, the prosciutto was below average, kinda like the one Walmart sells, not enough for a $17 pizza. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Before you die you have to try their Mafaldi ai Fungi.  I would also recommend the kale salad and I'm a big fan of the beef carpaccio. The food and ambiance is great for a night out with friends or a date (although it can get noisy).  The food is consistently good and the wine selection has something for everyone.  Service is friendly, inviting, and knowledgeable.  I'm pretty much  regular between here and Trattoria Nervosa (same owner).  Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Pros: Won't bust your wallet, delicious, great location, good drinks, great atmosphere, good for all kinds of groups, wide range of dishes Cons: Loud on most evenings, can get busy, downtown, hard to find parking.  Wow! I heard about Gusto 101 through the raving reviews of my friends and family. I love their sister restaurant, Nervosa, so I decided to give it a try. What a wonderful spot!   Gusto 101 is in a great location downtown (though beware, finding parking may be a bit hard). The dining area is very hip and fits lots of people; the actual restaurant seems like it used to be a large garage, but don't let that fool you since the decor is great! In the summer months, they open up their front patio, which is lovely during both the daytime and night. They have tables to accommodate both large parties and more intimate ones (GREAT first date spot!) which are always packed, giving the restaurant a great energy.   The food is awesome too! I know bread there is no long free, but maybe splurge because it's delish. They have some great cocktails (which I would suggest over wine, not because it's necessarily better but it seems to be their specialty) as well as a bar area sitting right in front of the kitchen, so you can catch a glimpse of their pizza-making process.   Speaking of pizza... YES. Holy moly. Gusto's pizza is made inside of their stone pizza oven, and is fantastic to order for yourself or share among others (if you can). Their appetizers also remain superb, but if you're into something lighter I would highly suggest their kale salad with pine nuts and parmesan, accompanied by salmon or chicken. The staff are very accommodating (not to mention cute) and food is served hot and relatively quickly. The best part? You don't have to go broke for a fantastic meal. Gusto 101 has truly made Italian cuisine hip, urban, and young again."}
{"text":"With all the amazing reviews I would have thought this place was amazing - unfortunately it fell short of that.  Funghi Pasta pretty much tasted like thick gravy mixed with pasta and mushrooms.   The Seafood Pasta was good, but nothing special.  The portion size was small, and the \"tiramisu\" was served in a jar. It shouldn't be advertised as tiramisu...  Overall... 2 thumbs down."}
{"text":"What a find. Around the corner from our AirBnB condo. I had the ravioli and wife had the kale salad. Amazing creative food and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Came here on  Tuesday night - we made reservations for 6pm (other than 6pm seatings for dinner, they take walk ins only). The restaurant was pretty busy for a weeknight. I love that their house red and white wines are only $1 an ounce and can be ordered in any increments.  This is a huge plus :)  The eggplant parmesan special was delicious - very cheesy. The sage butter pumpkin agnolotti was fantastic - the pumpkin filling was so tasty and the sage butter sauce was to die for (it's REALLY butter-y which I loved but for those of you looking for something healthier...perhaps not the best option).  Also really enjoyed the crema cotta dessert which is a small portion of a creme brulee type dessert w/ a slight coffee flavour.  Service was also very good!  Place is slightly loud with tables very close together, so don't expect a quiet romantic dinner.  Would definitely recommend for a reasonable priced Italian meal with decent sized portions and yummy food."}
{"text":"Well worth the wait. Gusto was all the talk this summer with the great patio, good food making it THE IT place to hang out and THE most impossible place to get a table all summer long.  So come fall and come open tables...So Glad! okay so there were still only 2 tables available on a Friday evening after work. We sat at the kitchen bar right in front of the sous chef and the oven which was actually quite entertaining and engaging.   For starters we had the mushroom bruschetta - every kind of mushroom perfectly sauteed on a perfectly crisp baguette.  For mains we had the fish which was perfectly cooked served in top of rice and great tasting roasted cauliflower. We also had the braised lamb pasta in tomato sauce which i was not too crazy about - the braised lamb was delicious but the tomato sauce could use a kick of something it was a little low on flavour.  We were stuffed with food so did not try the dessert but there is so much on the menu that i would love to go back to try!  Great food, Great Ambience, Great location (wish i sat on the patio over the summer) and Great prices!"}
{"text":"Love the upstairs patio and seating arrangement is great if you're having dinner alone . It seems like everyone orders the same dishes .. Kale salad and the mushroom pasta and that's because the mushroom pastas is stuff of dreams! It's creamy but not too creamy, just the right amount of truffle and the pastas is chewy but not too chewy.   I'm not a particular fan of kale salad but this is by the far one of the best ones I've had. The garnishing definitely helps balance the taste of kale. Also had their ravioli which was equally divine but I was still hungry after.  And $1/ounce wine?! Enough said."}
{"text":"Gusto does a ton of things right. The food is no-nonsense Italian. Not trying to be fancy, just quality with authenticity and creativity all wrapped together. All the flavours are good, prices are affordable and the atmosphere is busy. Seems like I always have to wait a bit to get in, but that's just a tribute to how much people like it. Pizza or pasta, its never disappointing."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday with a group of 8.  No reservations so we showed up fairly promptly for 7pm; grabbed a drink at the bar and were shown to our seats shortly after. It's a pretty big place so probably not a bad spot for similar sized groups. Although it was busy.   I had a cocktail and it was pretty good, the bulk of the group went with their on tap house wine which pours for $1 an ounce. I will likely go that route if I find myself here again. Bottled beers available; moderate selection.   Menu had some options, pretty standard though and nothing too risky from what I remember. My appetite was not huge that night so I opted for the hamburger. Fun presentation; it's served a chopping block and comes with some house-made toppings including a homemade ketchup that I found rather bland.   Saw some pasta dishes and the cod entree (some kind of white fish) at our table and they looked nice.   Would try again."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, sure to be a big hot spot.  The food is fantastic.  I had the gnocchi and it was absolutely delicious..best pasta dish I've had out.   We had a side of brussel sprouts which were unusually done and very tasty.  Prices were very reasonable, and the service was absolutely fantastic.  Servers were chatty and engaging, and very enthusiastic about the place.  Even the chefs were friendly, despite being very busy  (we were sat along the bar facing the kitchen, an interesting seat)!  Decor was very trendy and modern, exposed pipe, etc.  Apparently its a converted garage.  Overall, fantastic first impression.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Service:  The service was good, the server was nice and made some good recommendations. Our food was under cooked and the server immediately got us a new one. A nice and accommodating server. However, the way they take orders, with their phone app comes off as very unprofessional. As I was eating I saw 2 servers sitting on their phones, looking like they were doing anything but taking orders. It doesn't suit the restaurant ambience and looks rather unprofessional.    Food:  The polipo, the octopus was delicious. Not something you find often, definitely worth a try.    The mushroom pasta, fettuccine ai funghi was good. It was nice and creamy but I think it lacked mushroom flavour.   As for the seafood pasta, spaghetti al Nero di seppia was under cooked and the second one they brought us the seafood was over cooked and rubbery. It was rather disappointing.  Overall, it is a nice place for brunch but don't expect too much for the food. There is definitely room for improvement."}
{"text":"Went to Gusto for dinner and we were kept waiting for a table for 1.5 hours after being told the wait time is 45 mins.  The hostess was very complacent and totally clueless about when tables freed up. In fact, we had to point out to her that there are tables available after she was insisting that there wasn't any space, and we'd be waiting a while. Furthermore, her concept of time was completely warped; after we had been waiting for 40 minutes, she told us we had only been waiting for 15.  Eventually the manager had to control the situation and seated us; however, she wasn't particularly apologetic or appreciative of our custom.  The food and ambiance was lovely but this experience added a sour note to the evening.  After this negative experience, I emailed the management team at Gusto who were very apologetic and invited us back for a complimentary meal.  This time the experience was amazing, Ronnie and her team took great care of us and saw that we were treated well. The entire evening was awesome.  The food as always was delicious!"}
{"text":"One of my classic go-tos: Gusto has awesome food (the fungi pizza, funghi pasta and kale salad are my faves). Fun atmosphere which is great for a casual lunch, date night or group dinner. The service is awesome and you can see the kitchen staff cook your food in the open kitchen. I'm not a fan of their house wines that they sell for a $1 an ounce but they have other great choices or you can try the house stuff if you're looking for a deal. Their sister restaurant in Yorkville, Cafe Nervosa, has the same menu anf experience. Both top rated!"}
{"text":"Nice place, love their Bruschetta and Ceaser Salad.  Although the amount of food in each dishes are abit less than what I expected. My friend order the pasta, which is abit under cooked. We came on a rainy day, so it would be better to have a place to put our umbrellas."}
{"text":"Great food every time. The space itself is airy, funky cool, chic, yet laid back all at the same time. I've been here for business lunches, after work dinner and drinks, it really is a versatile restaurant. It would even be appropriate for a date. Not too stuffy but still really nice. The only downfall is they don't take reso's on a Saturday night which can be challenging"}
{"text":"Very good Italian. Prices are resonable for the portion size. Enjoyed the vibe as well."}
{"text":"After my first visit to Gusto, I was impressed. I enjoyed one of their fish specials and their wine was delicious. My second visit had its ups and downs. My dining partner and I loved the beef carpaccio. However, our steaks ultimately left us feeling disappointed. Unfortunately, both of our portions were tough. We required steak knives but our server informed us that the restaurant did not have any. I would recommend ordering something else."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in for dinner last night (Saturday night).  We expected a wait which they said would be an hour, so we wandered in to have a drink at the bar to discover that there were many empty bar seats looking over the kitchen prep line. So we had our dinner here and got served right away. The atmosphere and vibe was excellent and probably the best part of the restaurant. The food was OK. Definitely nothing spectacular. My boyfriend order the bruschetta. Which was mushrooms not tomatoes -so definitely not what he was expecting. The house wine was good as well - we shared a bottle. I ordered the grilled chicken which was cooked perfectly, unfortunately it was completely overpowered by the cilantro-based sauce that was covering the plate. The price was on the higher end but reasonable but likely won't be back. There are way better Italian restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service and vibe. Definitely going back to try more stuff on the menu. Everything coming out of the kitchen looked amazing."}
{"text":"Nice little spot in the Downtown area. Went there with a friend on Friday and the food was pretty dang good. I recommend the wild mushroom bruschetta, perfectly browned mushrooms toped with manchego cheese on a crisp baguette...mmmm. The atmosphere is nice but loud, so don't plan to have a heart to heart in there :)"}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner for my birthday. My boyfriend and friend got there early about 9 pm and they said it would be about an hr and a half wait (yes that long!!), so they put our name in and the wait began.  We decided to go to the bier markt for a drink and perhaps an app while we waited (see my review for them!). Fortunately we had a drink and an app paid and left just as they were texting us to tell us our table was ready.  We were a party of 5 so I guess that's why we got the weird table right by the door, luckily it was a warm night and the restaurant was buzzing so we weren't cold and not really in the way either. I ordered the sangria and the fettuccini funghi, and oh my god! Was it ever perfect. The noodles were a perfect al dente, the cream sauce was nice and light with a mass quantity of mushrooms. It's quite possibly the best pastas I've ever had. 3 of my friends had the ricotta ravoli which they said was great. My last friend had the burger which came out in the cutest cutting board with a basket of rosemary fries. While the fries were nothing to write home about she said the burger was amazing. Perfectly cooked and all cheesy and melty.  We ended with the desert platter - panna cotta, chocolate brownie with banana whipped cream, Italian donut, and some chocolate mousse thing that tasted like skor. All were terrific, the panna cotta was probably my favourite as it was nice and light with a mixture of orange and cherry flavours. The doughnuts were crusted with almonds for a nice crunch.  Overall this place is excellent!!! It was totally worth the wait. The pricing is well worth the food. If your looking for a shorter wait time try earlier in the day, they do take reservations for the first 10 or so tables when they open at 6 pm for dinner."}
{"text":"Every time I pass by this place, it is always so noisy up at the patio so this time it was my turn. The dinning room on the main floor was very dim and dark, and very stuffy so we decided to go upstairs to the open area. It was too bad that all the tables were booked, so there was only the bar seats along the skylight. But it was still outdoors in the patio looking down on Portland St. It was clear blue skies and it wasn't that humid today so there was a nice breeze.  I ordered the Estate pizza - prosciutto, buffalo mozzarella, fresh heirloom tomatoes, arugula, shaved parmigiano, basil oil. The pizza came was not hot, the crust was only a little warm and the crust was so tough, it was impossible to cut up and the tear off. So I ended up eating it like a salad. The wood fire pizza was ok, not that impressive. My friend ordered the pasta dishes which was better.  Mafalde ai Funghi - portobello, porcini, oyster mushrooms, truffle, cream sauce. It was very rich and filled with taste of portobello taste. The other pasta dish was the Rigatoni Lucani - braised ontario lamb, tomato, green olives, pecorino, gremolata. The lamb was still tough, so the portobello dish was better. But both the pasta came only luke warm as well, would have tasted a lot better if it was hot off the pan. It was definitely better than the pizza though.  The atmosphere here was great though, we had a great time catching up and chilling with a jug of sangria. If it wasn't the waitress giving us the bill to free up the seats, we might have stayed a little longer. Overall, food was alright, service was good, atmosphere was good."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic night at Gusto 101:  Charred Octopus Kale Salad Butternut Squash Agnolotti House Red Wine AMAZING.  Nuff said. See you soon."}
{"text":"Great rooftop patio like others have said. Ordered prosecco, light, cool and refreshing on a summer afternoon when we went. Battered fried Calamari with jalapeños and pickles and interesting combo...I ordered the DaDee pizza, was ok.... Instead of kale, they only had Arugala as a substitute... LOTS of arugala. Should've went the safe route and went with a Margherita.  The dessert platter with creme brûlée, banana and nutella with peanuts and strawberry pastries was heaven!!! Service was en pointe. Great crowd, unisex washrooms. Caution: go early in the afternoons for dinner unless you feel like lining up!"}
{"text":"I live and work in the area, so I've been coming here at least twice a month for a couple of years.  Why? -Amazing and consistent food. -Great buck an ounce wine.  Both the red and white are very drinkable.  My faves: The Polipo or Cavolo Nero as a starter.  And my go-to main, depending on my mood, is either the burger, salmon or steak.  The BF always, always orders the Bucatini al Ragu, while my vegetarian friends swear by the Mafalde ai Funghi pasta.  It can get a little loud during lunch and dinner, but it's not because of blaring music, which helps.  My only wish is that they'd offer grilled calamari as a side option for the salads, the same way they do at sister resto Trattoria Nervosa.  Then again, Nervosa doesn't offer buck an ounce wine..."}
{"text":"If you get a table on the top floor, it's amazing! Great atmosphere up there.   The food is really good. I've been there once for dinner (ordered a mushroom & truffle oil pasta) and once for brunch (had eggs benedict with a generous side of green salad and really good toast) and was very happy with the food/service/experience both times. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Went around 6:30pm on a Friday evening for a birthday.  The place was packed already. Our wait time to be seated for table of four was 45 mins.    The ambience has a rustic feel to it. There were tables outside, in the basement,  in the ground floor, and on the roof top.  The tables were so close to each other and you're left with too little space to move.  The place was loud,  but not with the sound of music.  It was loud cause of too many people chattering with one another. I would like it more if there's at least music playing. They only have the washroom on the basement, so imagine going to the washroom was a trip cause we were seated on the rooftop plus to manuever around tables was a quest.    The service was okay.  The server was nice but we waited for our food for atleast 45 mins.  Maybe because the place was packed.   I ordered their Rigatoni Bolognese as my main course.  We ordered tuscan fries and bruschetta to share.  The food was mediocre.  Nothing really special to it.  Plus, the pasta that I ordered was not even warm.  The plate was warmer than my food which is a bit disappointing.     Needless to say, I didn't finish my food.    Overall, I'd say that I felt nothing special about this place. I won't say that I will never come back here. I will still give this place a chance.  It's just not on top of my lists of restaurants to recommend to others."}
{"text":"I've gone to breakfast here about 4 times and the staff are always friendly and courteous. Although my last brunch session wasn't perfect, the lovely manager made up for it a hundred times over. Thank you Gusto for actually caring about your customers. Chivalry is definitely not dead at Gusto ;)."}
{"text":"I've been to Gusto 101 several times for dinner. It has the winning combination of a great vibe, good service and delectable food! Just a little warning to begin, this place gets VERY busy so get there early or expect to be waiting in line.   The restaurant is rustic chic with an industrial loft-like feel. It creates a very romantic and sophisticated ambiance from the moment you walk in.   I've tried the following dishes: - Polipo - so good that I've ordered this every time I've gone! The grilled octopus is so tender, not at all rubbery. So many sauces and flavours in this dish that no two bites are the same and keeps things interesting.  - Fettucine ai funghi & Mafalde ai funghi- Seems like the fettucine is no longer on the menu, but has been replaced with something similar now called Mafalde ai funghi which I have also tried. Personally, I enjoyed the fettucine more but the mafalde was different and new, never tried a noodle like this before. The truffle oil just makes this dish! I know some carnivores are hesitant to order a meatless dish, but this is something else. It is so rich and creamy, and delicious. If I haven't tried many dishes at this restaurant, it is because of this dish!! -Proscuitto e Rucola pizza - WOW! This was just as amazing as the other dishes I've tried. It came out hot and tasty, and all ingredients tasted fresh.  The dollar and ounce house wine is also a fun and unique touch - hearing about it is what got me in the door in the first place, and I'm so glad it did!  I will definitely return to try more items on the menu! I just hope I can just stop ordering the ai funghi pastas!"}
{"text":"Gusto 101 gets top marks for atmosphere and originality. After hearing a lot of buzz about the place a few months ago, we decided to check out the restaurant and immediately fell in love with the ambiance of the revamped garage, warm lighting and cool industrial decor. You also can't beat the $1 per oz. house made wine!   The food is traditional Italian fare: pretty good, but nothing over-the-top impressive. We started with the fresh ricotta bruschette and enjoyed the maldon saltiness of it. We both ordered the pumpkin ravioli in a brown butter sauce. This was delicious, but unfortunately, no longer on the menu. I hope they bring it back - it was something different and a great, interesting option for vegetarians.   I recently tried to go back a second time, without a reservation on a Thursday night. Suffice to say, Gusto 101's popularity has surged over the past two months and the wait was going to be an hour. Being a lover of atmospheric restaurants, I will definitely try to come back - with a reservation next time!"}
{"text":"When Gusto originally opened up the food was to die food, it was 5 star!!!! The last 2 times I've gone, I'm assuming the chef changed because the food was subpar and over salted. I usually get the same dish each time so I know what it should taste like but I don't know what happened recently."}
{"text":"I have been here many times, either on dates or with friends, and this place has been consistently awesome .   The red wine sangria is one of the best, and I've had at least three of their pizzas which have all been excellent.  Last time I came here, my friend and I sat at the bar (there was a line for the patio) and STILL received excellent service and food. It's such a good atmosphere, especially for after work drinks and apps!"}
{"text":"I went there on Friday, Aug 16 for my friend's birthday party. They had a fire and we had to wait for more than 1 hour before being served which we could understand.    We were seated on the front patio close to the street, the food was very good however the waiter was very rude as if the fire was caused by us. He spent a long time texting and looking at his phone instead of doing his job. He even disappeared a few times (went outside of the restaurant).  Each time we had to wait for a long time to get his attention in order to place our orders. In the end I had to give up on my dessert.  I hope the owner noticed this, they are losing business to hire a waiter like him."}
{"text":"The Kale Salad and Mushroom truffle Pasta are both amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple of weeks ago for a work party and the food was excellent! They brought around platters of arancini, mushroom bruschetta, burrata cheese, and thin crust pizza. There were tons of leftovers so I was more than happy to take some home ;) Looking forward to returning at some point to enjoy a full meal."}
{"text":"1) The servers take orders on a mobile phone app.  It's probably the worst customer experience you can have because there is almost no interaction with them.  Just them staring down with a florescent light coldly illuminating their face.  I understand there may be some advantage with regards to restaurant operations/efficiency but Gusto 101 isn't a factory.  You're going for the overall customer experience and I believe the mobile app they have employed with their servers significantly impacts the vibe they're trying to create.  If management is insistent on the mobile app, install iPads at the tables, have the customer enter their own order and save their tip.  2) The bathrooms are shared.  If you are dining on the top patio, you have to walk to the basement to a room with shared sink with 4 or so private toilets.  The toilets themselves are private, but there is no Men's or Women's designation so it's a free-for-all.  Men and ladies' private business should be kept private, not shared, especially at an mid- to upper-end Toronto restaurant.  Surely they can modify the basement to accommodate for two separate facilities.  I would only go back if a group of friends had already planned to go there.  I wouldn't recommend for dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing food, very quick service , knowledgeable staff -5 stars! Atmosphere is way too busy - feels like a restaurant on \" night club steroids\", spacing between tables is ridiculously small-someone's rear is always in your face when getting up and u are practically having dinner with the ppl next to you, music is way too loud. It's just not personable. The food is exceptional though albeit pricey. :)"}
{"text":"Was out to celebrate a friend's promotion at work. Our celebration was made even more special by the manager Kirsten, who passed by to check on us. Service was already fantastic but Kirsten kicked it up a notch and really made my best friend feel special. Thanks so much for making our evening great. Well done, and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I always order the Mafalde ai Funghi and Estate pizza and they always come out great! The food always consistent and service is prompt! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night with a friend before a concert at the Rogers Centre.  Made a 6pm reservation so we wouldn't have to take a chance waiting in a line - strangely, you still have to wait in line, the reservation line. Just weird, get your shit together hostesses. Yes, there were 2.   Once we were sat up on the roof top patio it was smooth sailing from there. Our waitress was attentive and friendly, offering very good suggestions. My friend got the white sangria to start, she said it was good - typical refreshing sangria while I got the house $1 oz white wine - I was impressed, good wine and great price point!   We shared the bruschetta to start - so yummy, not your typical bruschetta with very fresh ingredients, toasted bread and gooey cheese. For our mains we got the flank steak salad and the chicken salad - both were well portioned, a little pricey, but very good.   I would come back for apps and drinks for sure. I hear the octopus appetizer is good as well as the pizzas."}
{"text":"If I could eat one dish for the rest of my life, it would be the Mafalde ai Funghi pasta from Gusto.   It is a mushroom lover's dream, a menagerie of mushrooms in a creamy truffle sauce on a bed of wavy ribbon pasta. Every bite is magical and you can't help but tear up thinking how amazing it is but also how each bite means there is one less to enjoy.  There is no question why this dish is their most popular one. You'll have to try it for yourself to understand, and once you do, you'll be grateful you did."}
{"text":"Top notch food with great flavours. Wanted something simple but a treat for the palette and Gusto fit the bill. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I work in a hotel and try to recommend Gusto to as. many. people. as. possible. I've been for both lunch and dinner, and have never had a bad experience. I think the same woman owns Trattoria Nervosa in Yorkville which would explain my obsession -both are excellent. The atmosphere is laid back and the service is friendly. It does get incredibly busy but that's a mark of how great it really is."}
{"text":"Great little place with wine on tap. Love the truffle pasta. Great for small groups and dates."}
{"text":"On the expensive side for small portions but food tasted good. Service was fine and food came as fast as any other restaurant. The portions should be bigger for the price but they are more of a fancy, upper class restaurant so it's expected. If you're looking for a nice date spot and to splurge a little, this place is it. It gets busy on the weekends and you can end up waiting 30 mins or more for a table."}
{"text":"The truffle pasta is amazing. It is not worth the wait.  We waited over 1.5 hrs for a table for 4 for dinner. Few service mishaps which explains my rating. The hosts at the door advised there were 5 ppl ahead of us. When we came back 20 mins later, they advised 8 ppl were ahead of us. Not sure how that makes sense.  They sell wine by the oz. I ordered a glass of 5 oz wine. When the bill came, they charged for 6 oz and the bartender explained that they usually bill for 6 oz.  I thought they'd apologize or correct the bill. But no, it was stated like a matter of fact that I should have known. Overall, good food. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"The first thing that truly stands out about Gusto is its ambience. It is very intimate yet lively and vibrant and it really makes everything better. Went there with my friend who ordered one of the Pizza's and I ordered the butternut squash pasta and we both loved our dishes. The butternut squash pasta was simple yet flavourful and quite the right portion size. The pizza was big but my friend absolutely loved it as well. Service was adequate and I would definitely go back. Would also love to check out their 2nd floor."}
{"text":"Ended up there on a double date last night.  Didn't have a reservation but was able to get a table after about 15 minutes  as we were sipping our wine by the oz near the bar. Ended up sitting upstairs which was just as beautiful as their main level. It was quite busy, the table that we were situated was at a high traffic lane way near the back beside the bar and I guess kitchen. So we had people constantly bumping into us as they passed. We ended up eventually moving, however it seemed like a big ask.    Kale salad was ok, similar to what I had before there but nothing to note or  highlight. My friend  and I  ordered the burger. However, we both ended up sending it back, as my first bite was like taking a mouthful of salt. As someone who  normally loves salty and savoury, even I deemed the burger as drowning in salt. I ended up ordering a pizza instead, which was mediocre at best and we decided to continue the night somewhere else for dessert   The vibe and atmosphere here is always amazing and really can't be replicated elsewhere."}
{"text":"Tasty mushroom pasta!  A lot of great choices.  My husband liked the lamb pasta....  It was pack with people on a friday night!   will come here for sure for other food! ;)"}
{"text":"10-mins no acknowledgment, empty water cups, bit snugged table directly next to me, everybody seems very comfortable working,maybe too involved in hugging and chit chatting. Menu in clipboards,Bread with olive oil placed after I requested for the bread. We ordered appetizer,the Avocado Toast, must try ingredient fresh not over powering, good kick to it. main coarse Mafalde Ai Funghi very rich creamy go with a side of greens ,go really hungry in order to finish it very big portion. My partner Ordered the Salmon Grilled,side of Tuscan Fries, fish fresh excellent presentation. Pictures included!"}
{"text":"This place is a perfect date spot. Really cute ambience.. their food is delicious, but smaller portions. We had the kale salad, Brussels sprouts and fried cheese balls. The cheese balls, an order comes with two. The only downfall was that their portions were small. The margarita pizza was simple, but delicious. The mushroom pasta was amazing.. I highly recommend it. It was creamy and very tasty."}
{"text":"Great vibe. Service is great - food is good. Appreciate the interesting menu - but would have liked to see some Italian staples as well."}
{"text":"Arugula salad with pine nuts, I love. Will come back to try an entree but it was very nice/fun here during the summer time on a date or with friends!"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful!! The even have house wine for $1/oz which is AMAZING.   You can't beat this type of atmosphere. Will definitely be back for more!! @nomsoftoronto"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars   I came here Sunday for an early dinner. The rooftop patio was really nice. It was not too busy upstairs, just a few tables were occupied.  The food was delicious -- I have the prosciutto pizza and it was cooked just right. House wine is $1 per ounce which is a good deal.   My only complaint was the service. Considering it was not very busy, service was pretty touch and go. Our server came by right away to take our drink order. He returned about a minute later to take our dinner order, but we were still deciding, so we asked him to give us another minute more. He then came back about 5 minutes later to take our order (still we haven't received our drinks -- he said they would be coming up shortly). We put in our dinner order and are still waiting for our drinks. They come several minutes later, followed by our entrees. The white wine was not even cold!!  It would have been nice to enjoy at least half of my wine before we received our entrees. I don't like that our drinks were served a minute before our entrees. It wasn't even busy so I am not sure what took so long.   Either way, dinner was nice. I would return again to give them another try."}
{"text":"Any restaurant that has Vino on tap is fun in my books :)  At $1 per ounce, this Rustic Southern Italian Restaurant is great place to hang out with friends after work or during brunch.   I have had Brunch, Lunch and Dinner at this place and the service and quality of food never fails me and it doesn't hurt that the exec chef Daniel Mezzolo is easy on the eyes ;)   Like all my reviews, I base my ratings based on:  1. Ambiance - Casual. If you are looking for privacy or looking for a dating spot...this is not the place. This is for hanging out with friends or coworkers after work. After 6 pm, this place gets packing! My friends & I had dinner reservations at 5:30 pm and safe to say, there was a line after 6:30 pm on a Friday night.   2. Food - The food here is Amazeballs (can I say that?). Im a big fan of the food here. My favorite main course is probably the Pumpkin Ravioli, that melts in your mouth or the Spinacci Pizza, which is delish!!    3. Service - Considering this place packs up after 6:00 pm, the service is impeccable! Its fast, friendly and the servers actually know the menu :)   4. Price - The price point at Gusto is quite modest given their location and quality of food. Safe to say that they wont blow a hole in your wallet.  I am going to reiterate myself and say that I have been to Gusto for Brunch, Lunch and Dinner and have never left disappointed. On the contrary, it is one of the places that my circle of friends frequent before going out for the night! In fact I m going back on the 25th January 2013 for my birthday!   Go for Gusto if you are looking for a good food, Wine on Tap and a great time!   Tip: They make their own Bread so its always fresh and chances are warm too :) and I dream about the Ricotta accompaniment!"}
{"text":"With all the buzz I heard about Gusto, I was EXTREMELY disappointed.  The chairs and tables are simple cheap patio style furniture, low lights, warehouse atmosphere which is dimmed and romantic lighting.. there are two levels to this place...we came here because we heard the food was amazing and top ten Italian restaurants in Toronto.   We ordered steak tar tar, gusto burger and meat ball pizza and escargot. The pizza was DISGUSTING AND HORRIBLE!!!! It was sauggy, the meat balls were factory made frozen meat balls. They literally cut the meat balls in half and put two big pieces on each slice. Steak tar tar (which is one of my fav dishes) was VERY BLAND. I had to put balsamic vinaigrette on it for taste. The gusto burger was OKAY!! NOTHING special about it. The escargot was decent.  The drinks were good. I guess that's why people highly rate it. Anything tastes good when you are drunk.   Overall, I would come back here only if I want to have a night of drinking. Defiantly not coming for the food."}
{"text":"One of the best casual Italian places! Always love their kale salad, bufala, beef tartare, mushroom pasta, salsicce pizza, and $1/oz wine!  First time tried the grill chicken with butternut squash sauce and was very tasty.  Cool unisex washroom downstairs - must check out ;b"}
{"text":"I decided to dine here after hearing rave reviews from a coworker and complimented with the high rating on Yelp. I was warned that if I didn't have a reservation I would have trouble getting in. So what do my party and I do, take a risk and go sans reservation on a Friday night. Lucky for us we arrived right after work just before 6pm and had a table right away.  Upon entering I loved the feel of the place. The main floor, darker with mood lighting perfect for an intimate moment and the upstairs extremely well lit bright with a retractable roof for the patio weather during the summer months. I was impressed with the seating upstairs as even in the dead of winter, the upper floor had a bright and cheery feel to it that instantly lifted my mood!  The server was attentive providing a good pace to service. At first look, the server appeared to look like she was texting on her phone, only to later realize that the it was an app to place orders. Efficient, however a little off setting especially should a diner assume otherwise. Great use of technology and fit to the vibe at Gusto 101.   I started with a drink and was amazed at the wine offerings especially the selection of reds. I opted for a house cocktail after the server raved about \"The Prime Minister\" (Bulleit Bourbon, Amaro Montenegro, Cardamom Honey, Lime Juice, Angostura Bitter) at $13 it was a good cocktail especially due to the fact that I normally don't order drinks with Bourbon however the flavours complimented.  My party and I opted to forgo apps and go straight for the main. We both ordered pasta:  Spaghetti al Nero di Seppia $17.95 (manila clams, shrimp, calamari, mussels, baby scallops, peperoncino, tomato, white wine sauce )  Fettuccine ai Funghi $17.50 (portobello, porcini, oyster mushrooms, truffle paste,  light cream sauce)  Hands down the Fettuccine ai Funghi was the best pasta I have ever tasted outside of Italy!! I typically forgo Italian especially pasta offerings as I leave disappointed in my meal, not at Gusto! The dish was creamy, rich, and extremely flavourful with a healthy serving of mushrooms without feeling heavy. Velvety goodness! I would go back just for that dish alone! My friends choice however was slightly disappointing lacking flavour although the seafood was abundant. The portions were smaller than the typical large American sized platters most establishments provided however I did not leave hungry and was happy I could finish my dish without letting it go to waste. Needless to say, the plate was cleared with not a noodle in sight.  Looking around the apps look divine, orders from neighbouring diners and would definitely go back to try more.   I look forward to warmer weather and would dine once the patio is open.  If your craving Italian definitely check out Gusto 101."}
{"text":"Wine is on tap $1/ounce. That's prettay, prettay, pretty good.  The pasta is fine, the ambience is lively and hip (in a King Street kind of way) and their upstairs patio looked great.  Make a reservation or come early. It's worth going to, and if we lived closer, I could see it becoming a regular spot. I wouldn't say it's worth going out of your way though."}
{"text":"Food: 9.5/10 Atmosphere: 9/10 Service: 8/10 Overall experience: 9.5/10  Though my boyfriend wholeheartedly disagrees with me on my 5 star rating, I stand firm. I'll be honest and say that a lot of it has to do with the fact that I absolutely love the patio, and the food has never disappointed me (rather than being the best in the business). So if your thing is a great buzzing atmosphere, really good food and wine, you'll love it.  I've tried both the mushroom pasta (\"Fettuccine ai Funghi\") and the mushroom pizza (\"Funghi\"). They have the exact same flavouring, it just depends on what kind of carb you are feeling that night. Both are great. The pasta really soaks up the flavour of the mushroom and it comes out piping hot. The pizza gives you that crunch you are looking for.   The kale salad for me was just okay. I wasn't a fan of the pine nuts in the salad, and found it more bitter than I would have liked it to be.   The sangria is great. I tried the red on a hot summer's day and it was a great refresher out on the patio.   The bottom line: a definite must-try for summer searchers."}
{"text":"Went on the weekend.  Had a great dinner with friends. As usual the kale salad was on point, with a fantastic atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good pizza....the famous mushroom pasta isn't much actually. The flavours are good but the pasta itself is ordinary. The pizza was well made the second time around but the marinara lacked the tomato sour hit that's needed. I would probably never go there again unless I heard something different. The staff is lovely though. Very caring and sweet. And shout out to the head chef too who took care of me really well."}
{"text":"I'd like to amend my previous review. I usually love this place despite a wait at the line and sometimes slow service.   At my last visit, myself and two other diners placed our order. As we waited for our food we watched the bus boy bring the same plates to the table beside us with the patrons claiming that it was theirs. I thought it was just a coincidence at first until we noticed that the other members of their party didn't get their food. We flagged to our server about the alleged mix up and within that time, three different individuals had gone up to the other table to apologize for the mix up. The server came up to confirm that the mix up did happen, and we said that nobody had come up to us to apologize. Afterwards, the manager came and made excuse after excuse about how he couldn't keep an eye on everything. But that's your job as a manager- to manage. In the meantime that we're waiting for our food, the other table who claimed our food got their actual orders and we were still waiting. First, who claims food that they didn't order??!! Second, the manager offered us desserts and I said we didn't want any- so I asked for comps. He said that it \"may be difficult\" to comp but he would see what he would do. After we finally got our food- about 50 minutes after we sat down- he came back to say that we were comped. At least we were treated properly- because no good self-respecting restaurant should expect guests to pay for a meal that came unapologetically late. Two stars for effort and still-tasty malfalde. Zero stars for useless bus boys."}
{"text":"Just rather mediocre Italian food overall.  Had the highly yelp recommended mushroom pasta with truffle oil, and found it rather bland.  The tomato ravioli was also lacklustre and the worse dish was probably the spinach pizza as the mounds of spinach was flavourless and the middle of the pizza was a soppy mess.  Only dish we liked was the beef tartare, but the crusty bread that came with it was overly oily. The fries were poor too, overly oily and underseasoned.  Service was friendly.  Overall a disappointing Italian meal."}
{"text":"Gusto 101 seems to be where the in-crowd frequents - a casual place to grab a drink or just to get a quick bite on their patio, enjoying the summer warmth.   The Mafalde ai Fungi is hands down the best mushroom pasta I've ever had, the best! The portions were just right and the pasta was cooked to perfection, each bite was a delight with the delicious hint of truffle oil. I love most things with mushrooms and this is currently my favorite.   If we had not ordered the grilled octopus, this place would have received a five star.  The Polipo was way too burnt and dry - every bite tasted like burnt rubber. The sauces (ketchup, wasabi) did not complement the octopus well in my opinion. Maybe they should try massaging the octopus before cooking them...   The pizza was also underwhelming. We ordered the Salsicce Pizza and it tasted undercooked and not at all meaty the way our server described it.   Overall, the service was great - I was really impressed by how our server was able to keep checking up on us despite being so busy. The rustic ambience fit the restaurant's theme well and you can see most tables enjoying themselves. I will definitely be back, but avoid ordering appetizers or pizza next time."}
{"text":"Delicious and trendy Italian food at a decent price. For a starter I suggest one of the kale salads. The Malfade Al Funghi is unbelievable!!! You can't go wrong with any of their pizzas. And surprisingly, the burger is quite good too!! Service is on point despite how busy the restaurant is, you always feel well looked after. Great food and experience!"}
{"text":"I love this place! amazing eats, you can have it done family style or individual, great drinks, wine by the glass ($1 per ounce, yes, please!) fast and personable service, pastas are great, pizzas delicious, but, their appetizers are fantastic!  and let's not forget about the salads. Great fun ambiance, fashionable decor, the only down side, you can only get reservations at noon and 6pm, any other time is, first come, first served, they do take you phone number and txt when ready, so i would just go somewhere else for a drink and comeback with your appetite.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had a work dinner at Gusto 101 and all I have to say was it was amazing!  Gusto 101 does a modern twist to the classic Italian dishes.    We started off our meal with two appetizers, the Arancini (aka risotto balls!) and the seared scallops.  Both dishes were delicious.  The bread they served in brown paper bag which was a neat presentation.  My colleagues and I ended up ordering all the same dish - the Sea Bass entree.  It was divine all the flavours together were a great combination.  One thing to note about this location is that it has a second floor great patio for the summer but during the winter is it is covered and gets a bit chilly if it is below -10C.  Wear extra layers if you end up reserving a spot on the second floor.  Service was great!  I will definitely be back for other events and occasions for a lovely meal."}
{"text":"Good service, great atmosphere, and most importantly: AMAZING MUSHROOM PASTA. The mushroom pasta (Mafalde ai Funghi) here is the best pasta I've ever eaten, ever, forever."}
{"text":"Sexy and Gusto knows it.  It's hard to believe that this space used to be a garage. Now, it's a trendy King West hot spot for a pre-party with Italian fare. There's an hour wait but at least the place is full of beautiful people -- it makes rubbing elbows more fun.  The Vini Di Gusto had been sold out for awhile.  Their house wine is made in their own basement cellar and is on tap for $1 per ounce.    OMG, wine on tap?! Really?   I want a wine tap in my house.  That evening they had  fresh batches of their house wines available, pinot grigio and merlot.  Fantastic!      *Appetizers* Arancini - Deep fried rice with mushrooms and tomato sauce  (8.95).  Crispy and filling, this appetizer sure was popular.  Polipo - Grilled octopus with green beans (13.50) The octopus was fresh and chewy with charred bits.    Beef Tartare with figs, ricotta, arugula, and truffle oil (14.50 large serves 3) The fig really made this dish much sweeter than expected.  I really liked the cute cube presentation but I wish it was served with different bread.  The bread slices were large, thick, and over-toasted.  Clumsy.  *Pasta* The Pappardelle ai Funghi is mushroom heaven and I wanted more.  Portobello and oyster mushrooms, truffle paste...mmmyummy (14.95)  The Gnocchi di Ricotta with sausage wasn't very exciting. Overcooked, slightly soggy, it's not something that I would order again (14.95)  I'm curious about the Tagliolini al Nero.  They infuse black squid ink into the pasta.  So if you like seafood, this would be a good one to try.    *Dessert* We had the sharing plate of 4 desserts for $12. The desserts here are small tasting portions.  * The chef's specialty is a sparkling lemon foam.  It was like a sour lemon tart in mist form. * The tiramisu was all whipped mascarpone and not much else. * The chocolate mouse had chocolate cakey bits and topped with sea salt.  The sea salt was large grain and too large for the delicate mousse.  Crunch. * The biscotti is like a meringue cookie (crunchy cookie styrofoam)  None of the desserts were amazing, but still a nice way to end dinner.  Gusto 101 is noisy, fun, uber trendy, and perfect for party goers but not a place I would return to for a nice Italian meal.  But I'll be back.  I want to see this rooftop patio."}
{"text":"Located in the convenient Queen west district, Gusto is an agreeable week day night bar. It's good for a drink, but not too late since they close at midnight and they don't let you in after 11:30pm. The food was alright and the 1$/1oz. wine concept is pretty cool. The rooftop is cool even though it's covered, so it gets a bit like a green hot house during the scorcher! Go out with a group of friends for the best experience of Gusto."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place although I've heard a mix of reviews from friends. Very cool hipster vibe just off King West with a nice patio. I had the prosciutto and arugula pizza which was very good and a friend and I split the beef tartar. Overall very good, I would go back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but the food were too salty.. The wait was t worth is and the service was poor"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, the place is great. Always consistent with quality and the mushroom pasta is delish. Wait time is a tad slower depending on the time but overall always a great experience."}
{"text":"If you can, try to grab a table on the upper floor during non-freezing months.  It's a nice patio with a glass roof and windows, so it's really more of a greenhouse that keeps you nice and cozy, even when it's dripping rain outside.    The fare is on the comfort side too.  Serving Italian cuisine, the first page on the clipboard menu features the special of the day, plus starters like cheese/charcuterie platters, beef tartare, beef carpaccio, Buffalo mozzarella, and salads.  Flip to the second sheet for pastas, pizzas, and entrées (mostly meat-based, with the exception of a whole grilled branzino for about $28).  For yesterday night, I opted for the beef tartare as an appetizer and the mushroom marfalde, a thick pasta with wavy edges - almost like a thicker, finger-width's lasagna, with black truffled cream.  The beef tartare was served on a wooden cheeseboard platter.  I thought it was OK and churned out some black pepper at the table, but the hubs found it to be perfect without any additional seasoning necessary.  The pasta was perfectly mushroomy.  If you like cream of mushroom soup, you'll probably love this dish too.  At the end of the meal, the hubs surprised me with a birthday cake (which apparently you have to preorder over the phone and reserve via credit card,  $24).  Made up of layers of phyllo pastry, cream and chocolate cream were thinly spread between each layer before being iced with a final cream layer on the outside and topped with blueberries.  The cake was pretty yummy, but not as creamy as you might expect.   All in all, pretty good.  The hubs has already been talking about going back!"}
{"text":"Located in the fashion district, heart of downtown-this place is a gem. Usually order the Mafalde Ai Fungi truffle pasta and it will satisfy your creamy pasta cravings. It is quite heavy to have the whole dish, but what I love about the dish aside from the truffle sauce is the thick cut pasta. I've also had the grilled octopus and I'm a HUGE fan. The grilled octopus was cooked perfectly and did not have a rubbery texture and the Chimichurri sauce was outta this world!  I would def come back for the food. The patio is usually packed and wait time is insane during days with great weather. Be prepared to wait, they have a wait list to send a text when the table is ready. There is another patio/bar right by the restaurant and it is perfect to have a drink while you wait for your table. There is also parking right behind the restaurant and it is very convenient.   After dinner, if you are up for a stroll to enjoy some art, graffiti alley is about a 15/20 Min away."}
{"text":"For our starter, we had the \"Cavolo Nero\" salad (organic lacinato kale, zante currants, toasted pine nuts, pecorino, parmigiano, lemon vinaigrette). It was very tasty. The tang from the lemon dressing, sweet from the currants, saltiness from the pecorino cheese and richness from the pine nuts were very enjoyable together. Plus you always feel healthy when you eat kale!  For our main, we had the \"Ravioli alla Norma\" (spinach and ricotta ravioli, eggplant, tomato sauce, ricotta, salata, basil). The pasta was properly cooked and the dish was well prepared. Overall, it was tasty but I wasn't blown away mainly because the flavours were mild. Problem solved when I added some house chilli oil. Tip: try the house chilli oil. It's got quite a kick and is very nice.   For dessert, we shared the Olive Oil Cake (olive oil cake, vanilla yogurt, citrus) for its novelty and I really liked it. The cake had a cheesecake-like texture (dense but soft) and wasn't too sweet. The fruit was tart and offset the cake nicely.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"love the mushroom pasta and the special on house wine.  i frequent here often as its super good quality food and good quantity for the price point.  Servers are attentive. no complaints."}
{"text":"Walked in at 7:00, was told a table for 2 would be 50 minutes(no big deal) they'll text us when it's ready. We left to go grab a drink and then 15 minutes later, we got a text saying our table was ready, be back in 5 minutes or cancel. Tried calling the location to see if we could get extended time or push us back on the waitlist but EVERY extension on their phone number sends you to an automated service. This should be thoroughly checked into, so of course we had to cancel. Very disappointed as we were really looking forward to eating here."}
{"text":"Always good food and attentive service. It does get quite busy during peak hours!"}
{"text":"They got me at wine on tap - and the one I had was pretty good (I had their house melbec). Pastas were delicious and it was a nice vibe."}
{"text":"Awesome ambiance. The appetizers are all fantastic, you can't really go wrong. I'd recommend the burger! It's amazing. Great service as well."}
{"text":"Honestly love this place. I think it's my fav restaurant on king west. Love the restaurant itself, the decor and the atmosphere has this rustic tint. The food is amazing, I've never been disappointed yet. The service is great if they aren't super busy. The dolce dessert platter is a must try!"}
{"text":"Alright, so Gusto 101 didn't blow my socks off, but was not horrible. We strolled into Gusto 101 after walking the streets on our empty stomachs. As soon as we saw Gusto, I jumped on the opportunity after hearing several good reviews from friends. It was also REALLY cold outside, so we were looking for some good comfort food. We came without reservations and luckily we got a table in the upstairs seating area. This was probably my only negative review on our experience. The table we were seated at ended up being situated on top of a uneven floor tile/wood, so that every time a server or fellow restaurantee walked by, it would make our table/seats move. To say the least, we got used to it but were still annoyed.   On to the food. My husband ordered a classic pizza with all the right fixings, and I the salmon. Both were well prepared, brought to our table by our helpful server. One thing I'd have to admit was it was a little pricey, but it comes with the territory I presume. To finish we got the trio of desserts, which again we were not blown away but still gobbled up.   So for an Italian restaurant, its what I expected and I would return again if asked."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal here... the pasta is delicious, and the service is very fast and friendly. The restaurant itself looks amazing, but try to get a reservation ahead of time, or dare to wait in line on the weekends, but once you're seated with the food in front of you, you know it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with a group on 6 and it looked pretty busy. We made reservations beforehand. We were seated upstairs which looked almost like a greenhouse - glass walls surrounded the entire floor. It was absolutely boiling near the back of the upstairs seating area; there's not much airflow that circulates that far back.   The food was amazing. I ordered the Mafalde ai Funghi which is basically like a mushroom pasta. It was delicious. The sauce was very rich and served with thick mafaldine pasta (ribbon shape) which held the sauce on eat piece really well. Would definitely get this dish again.  My friend also got the Margherita pizza which tasted good as well but I thought it was pretty average and nothing too special."}
{"text":"Oh gosh. I had high hopes for this place. We arrived at about 5:50pm on a Friday night. They said it would be a 30 minute wait--normal. I went to the bar to get a drink while we waited and ordered a red sangria. The bartender gave me a white sangria. Whatever because our table was ready after only five minutes!  Service was slow from the get go, but it was busy so kind of understandable. We finally ordered. It took awhile for our appetizer (arancini) to arrive, but I wasn't bothered because it was busy. The arancini was not good. First of all, one ball was cooked, but the other wasn't. It was cooked on the outside, but the rice on the inside was not done. Secondly, it wasn't that great. Not even the cooked piece. I've had better arancini from a frozen box.  I ordered a glass of red wine. It took forever to arrive.  Lastly, we ordered the mushroom pasta and the prosciutto pizza. My wife liked her mushroom pasta. My pizza was okay except they didn't cut it. They gave me a full pizza with no knife to cut it. Bizarre. We go out to eat a lot and this was one of my first disappointing experiences in Toronto. Not sure I'll go back."}
{"text":"I would recommend sitting upstairs. Food was delicious and drinks were good as well. A little on pricey side and not the best service- especially the rude hostesses."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan. Stunning design. Love the patio upstairs with the retractable roof. As for the food, I go back for the kale salad. Who knew kale could taste so amazing?"}
{"text":"We went to Gusto for a business lunch, and the entire team had a good time. The burger selection and drinks were great."}
{"text":"The food was worth the wait. This place is quite small and packed. You might have to wait to get a patio seat if you come with a larger group of guests.  The food was excellent. A perfectly made pizza and beer on a hot day is an awesome experience.   The service was great as well. The server looked stressed out from how busy the restaurant was but she was very kind to keep checking on our table to make sure we have everything we needed.   Overall, 5 stars for food  3 stars for the wait and how packed it is inside the restaurant"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night with a girlfriend. They were full for tables at 8pm with  Christmas parties and the proximity to clubs ln King west and also no reservations. Ordered the mozzarella plate to split to start it was really good but they brought out our main while the starter was still there. I wanted to tell them to calm down. The waitress seemed antsy to get us moving through the motion and we had a shit seat so they could have at least let us take more than twenty minutes to eat. Rush the people who don't have bar seats and get ran into my passerbys!! We both had the mushroom pasta and It was good but came out kind of cold and the pasta a bit harder than I expected but I was there for the truffle cream and it was goooood. Had a delicious Baileys Americano to finish. We stayed to talk after and the waitress seemed more displeased than all the ten of us crammed into the bar area lol. However despite my complaint it was a nice environment and it's dark to set the mood if you're on a date and nice candles and unique place. The food looked so good that everyone was ordering especially the pizza !!! Washrooms were unisex which seems to be an adjustment for two of the men who left the doors wide open so we could see and hear them peeing and then nt wash their hands as they left. I pray he wasn't a worker there ha"}
{"text":"Just had the worst restaurant meal I've ever had in a restaurant in Toronto and currently am making myself lunch after barely being able to eat the soggy brunch I was served. The previous reviews on here about the food being extremely underwheliming, with a nice venue sum up my experience at Gusto.   Food   Lets start with the food. I ordered the Omelette from the Brunch menu, which is an Omelette with spinach, cheese and mushrooms with Kale salad and potatoes. The Omelette was extremely soggy, and when I cut into it just with my fork, all the toppings fell out of it. I made an attempt to get the toppings and egg together, when I tasted the egg and toppings the spinach tasted like mush, the eggs were soggy and the mushrooms were rubbery.   After two bites of this \"Omelette\" I decided to move on to the Kale salad, which was extremely salty and also soggy, it tasted like over cooked seaweed. I then tried some of the potatoes. The skins on the outside were overcooked and fell off the potato, leaving behind the dry pasty, unspiced inside of the potato. The only thing that made the potatoes salvageable was the fact that my boyfriend ordered a dish with a chickpea pure sauce that I could dip the dry potatoes in.   Service   The service was very mediocre. One of the other guests at the table politely asked the server if she could have the dressing on her Kale salad on the side and was told no, because the dressing is massaged into the Kale and that is how the chef serves it. Gusto also cannot accommodate those with dairy allergies who would like to enjoy a coffee with their brunch. They do not have soy or almond milk or any kind of dairy substitute.   Also, if you have 6 or more guests be prepared to pay an automatic gratuity of 18%...based on this automatic gratuity for our group of 6, I would have expected a higher level of service and the ability to order your food the way you want it ex. dressing on the side.   Venue  This is the only aspect of the dining experience that bumps it up from a 1 star to a 2 star review. I sat on the roof top, which offers an open concept, high ceiling glass enclosure with exposed brick and a rustic feeling. However, the venue does not justify a soggy, underwheliming, lack lustre brunch, which prompted me to make my own lunch when I got home.   Overall, after having Gusto's brunch, I would pick McDonald's all-day breakfast menu over coming here....which is a pretty low bar. There are much better Italian or brunch restaurants in the city in terms of quality of the food you should consider over Gusto."}
{"text":"On my Toronto visit, wanted to dine in the Fashion District off Queen's street. This place was POPPIN!  Loud and busy, filled with beautiful people!  2nd floor is the ideal rooftop dining.  Seats/tables are small and uncomfortable but you'll put up with it once you've had a bite of their food.  Kale Salad and Funghi Pasta was the highlight of the night!  We came back to this place twice because I loved my meal so much!  Thank you for a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"For the amount of hype surrounding Gusto, it was pretty disappointing. The two stars are for the ambience/style of the   restaurant and second for the wait staff. They had great service from the hostess to the bar tenders everyone was super nice. The food on the other hand was mediocre, nothing special by any means, typical food you could get at any other restaurant chains. We ordered the beef tartar which was my favorite. The fig jam complimented the tartar really well.  The bolognese pasta was ok, sauce was meaty, but again nothing spectacular, as in nothing you couldn't make yourself. The meatball pizza was the most disappointing. I would not recommend ordering that pizza. Not enough provolone cheese, and meatballs were limited, I only had one meatball on my slice. I would come back for drinks, but no food next time- Not worth the 30-45 minute wait."}
{"text":"FETTUCINI AI FUNGHI - To die for! Must get this. Love the ambience/decor and open kitchen concept here. Trendy lil brunch spot.  Gelato Affogato drowned in espresso, liquore di caffe Also to die for...  That is all!"}
{"text":"The vibe is great here and the patio is a hit in the summer! the food is average - the pasta is nothing to write home about - on the ordinary side but cooked al dente which is nice.  Some of the apps are tasty, but the food isn't the thing that stands out at Gusto, it's the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I like this place , the food is ok and there is a nice vibe going on. I definitely suggest you to check it out. Make sure you get there not too late it can be very busy , specially the week end."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and I've enjoyed every visit. I usually come for dinner, which you definitely need reservations for, but I've also just come for drinks and dessert and had a pleasant experience. The staff are accommodating and the food is consistently good.  The last time I was there, I had the mafalde ai funghi (mushroom pasta, $17.50) and absolutely loved it. I could have dunked my head in that truffle cream sauce, it was so good. I wanted to get another order of it to go, but I settled for the tiramisu ($6.50), which was a good call. But I'd recommend getting the Dolci Platter ($15.50) to share 3 of the desserts with friends so you can taste them all.  Come when it's warmer and enjoy the rooftop patio. Just watch out for the bees."}
{"text":"Love the vibe here especially in the summer on the rooftop patio. Great place to grab dinner and drinks with a group of friends in the heart of King ST.   The food itself is pretty good but the service is hit or miss. I prefer going to their sister restaurant, Cafe Nervosa in Yorkville. Maybe it's just me but I find the quality of food and overall experience to be better there. But this review is about Gusto so here is a round up of my top there favourite items: - Funghi pasta (also available at Nervosa) $20 - Salaicce pizza (ask for chilli oil!!!) $19 - tiramisu (the BEST in the city) $10  At the end of the day you you can't go wrong here. I say go and try for yourself - enjoy!"}
{"text":"Soooo much of what makes this restaurant great is the vibe/decor. It just feels cool.   If you want go on a Friday or Saturday night, prepare to wait. Luckily, this is one of those restaurants where you put your name on the list, head somewhere else for drinks for an hour (or two!) and they'll text you when your table is ready.   The house wine was $1 per oz and comes in a pitcher. We were offered a taste along with one of the other wines. I can tell you that it was pretty vinegary compared to a nice wine. Drinkable, but certainly not good. They did have other great wines to pick from though.  The bread to start the meal is served in a brown paper bag, a neat way to present it. the bread was nothing special though.  We started with the Octopus, which was actually a pretty big portion and perfect for sharing between 2. It was served on a dark wood board with a raw edge, the presentation was beautiful.  We each ordered a pizza. They were good, but certainly not amongst the best in the city. Thin crust, chewy dough, heavy on the toppings.   If I were rating this place purely on the food, I'd give it 3 stars, but the ambiance more than makes up where the food is lacking. A really trendy spot to spend an evening."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very nice and warm. Lots of wood and metal-- a warehousey feel, but with some warmth to it. They have an open kitchen and seating is kind of tight. We sat at the bar. Our server was a female, forgot her name. It was a bit slow but she was friendly and nice and seemed fairly knowledgable  We ordered the Branzino ($28.50) and Mafalde ai funghi pasta ($17.50) for our entrees and the cavolo Nero salad ($13.99) to start. The also have complimentary bread to start.  Everything we had was tasty. Each dish had its own distinct flavor. The branzino was grilled and the different sweet and savory flavors came together very well. The pasta was pretty heavy and filling. They don't skimp on the truffle/mushrooms which is great! Kale salad was nice and light with a lemon vinaigrette. I really liked that the citrus wasn't too strong or tart.  For dessert, we shared the panini al gelato. This was really yummy-- the olive oil drizzled with a bit of sea salt gave this sweet treat a savory twist. I was full after dinner, but we still gobbled this all up.   Great food and the kitchen seemed to run very smoothly. They have a good little system in place and all of the chefs seemed to be having a good time. Great to see."}
{"text":"Came by for dinner and was expected to wait for a table. To our surprise, we were seated immediately.   They have a special, an oz of house red or white for a dollar - yes, that was why I was wobbly when I left. I got a little wine-happy.   We ordered:  arancini 9.99 - wild mushroom risotto, fontina cheese, tomato sauce - perfectly seasoned and fried with oozing centres  Mafalde ai Funghi 17.50 - portobello, porcini, oyster mushrooms, truffle cream sauce - although the price may seem a little steep for a meatless pasta dish, it was so amazingly good and oh so worth the price. it is definitely a must try here!  Diavola 17.50 - spicy sun dried tomato pesto, smoked provolone, calabrese salami, roasted peppers - this pizza was very good. it was spicy but not overwhelming, it wasn't dry and it was so filling.  I love this place and would definitely come back for their other items and to check out their rooftop patio!"}
{"text":"Great vibes restaurant with floor-to-ceiling windows.  Tucked away in a quiet side street off the bustling King West. Very picturesque from the outside.  Delicious food, excellent service, nice ambiance. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday night with my friends, so we got a table right away. The waiter was super nice! He was so friendly and accommodating that half of us arrived late and was really chill with us ordering like a mess because I can never choose what I want. The pizzas were really good and filling, the pasta with the mushroom was AMAZING! I would go back to eat that mushroom pasta. Also house wine is $1/oz so that is always nice, got the red wine and it went really well with everything! The only thing is that the lighting is really dim inside but other that that it's super nice and would recommend!"}
{"text":"The only nice things about this place are the decor/environment and the house wine on tap for $1/oz.  Service is bad, part of our meal was not brought to us, we had to get out of our seats to get the servers attention and let her know. Then when asked for more water, same thing, didn't even come, had to ask another server who was placing an order. The server didn't seem to care that we were there or not. The food was not as good as expected, friends and I ordered a pizza, brussel sprouts, rigatoni pasta, burger and octopus. Nothing to brag about at all. House wine was decent for the price. Wouldn't recommend to friends, but maybe for some cheap house wine and that's it."}
{"text":"Loveeee their truffle pasta! Its a good place if you want to splurge on a nicer casual place for GREAT italian fare."}
{"text":"For all the buzz I've heard about Gusto, I was a little disappointed. We went for lunch on a Saturday and there were plenty of tables available, so no reservation required. It's a cute and quaint little location. I've heard the upstairs area is very nice, especially with the glass, but we did not get to see the upstairs area.  The food was okay, but nothing special. The pasta was not that good and didn't taste very fresh. The portion of the pasta was smaller than I thought. My boyfriend's pizza was good, but nothing spectacular.   Our waitress was not very friendly and was a little obnoxious. It seemed like she did not want to serve us, however she seemed to be much more friendlier with some of her other tables.  Overall, it was nothing special and I've had better Italian food in Toronto. I probably would not return."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and cheap wine ($1 per ounce).... what more could you ask for?  I came here on a date last year and loved the ambiance. It was cozy but not too intimate and still felt like you were at a restaurant. I got the mushroom pasta with truffle oil and it was just truffly enough to taste but not truffly enough to linger in my breath :)   I'd definitely come back for girls night out or just to eat at a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food, 4 for everything else. The food here is absolutely delicious. And our waitress was great! We ordered Arancini (risotto balls), beef tartare, polipo (grilled octopus), and malfade ai funghi (mushroom pasta). The Arancini could have been better (the tomato sauce takes away from the risotto balls). But everything else was just perfect. The beef tartare is prepared on the rare side of things- so be warned if you tend to like your meat cooked well. The highlights of our night here was the malfade ai funghi and the red wine sangria. I'm a meat eater so I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this mushroom dish. And the Sangria? You need to try this for yourself!   This place would've gotten a 5 stars from me if it wasn't for three things. One, super hot in this restaurant; they could use an air conditioner. Two, music is really loud and so I wouldn't recommend this place to parties more than 4. And lastly, the girls at the front were super disorganized. They were often times too busy chatting with each other sorting things out then attending to people waiting in line.   But overall, I would definitely recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped over in Toronto on a road trip from Boston to Chicago and on the way, looked up reviews of restaurants in the area. My friend lives off of pasta, so I searched for Italian. Gusto 101 did not disappoint! We were able to sit at the bar immediately and our super nice, very cute and quite flirty bartender immediately struck up a marvelous conversation and gave us wine recommendations. We were unabashedly hungry after 12 hours or so on the road and went to town on carbs. We got the bread, the fries, and both got the pumpkin ravioli. Everything was spectacular (though let's be real what is sourdough bread after their f***ing amazing focaccia) and thank god we both got the pumpkin ravioli because whoever didn't get it would have had serious FOMO. The ambiance was great as well - low lighting, a lively atmosphere, and warm modern decor. Will definitely be recommending it to anyone who asks for tips on Toronto in the future!"}
{"text":"popped in on a Friday night and luckily it wasn't busy so we got seated right away.  I personally loved the ambiance upstairs better than the main floor.  I loved the glass roof, I think it would be amazing in the summer for an afternoon brunch. the decor was great too.  the staff were friendly and our server Nicole was just amazing. She made the recommendations for all our food and we were not upset with single dish.  We started with the grilled octopus - a first for us both, the texture threw me off but the taste was good!   Main we had the mushroom pasta - the serving looked small, but it was rich and filling.  we finished off with a serving of the tiramisu - it was okay, I expected more lady fingers in it.   it seems as though the octopus and the mushroom pasta are favourites here! I'll have to try something else on my return."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on Canada Day Sunday. It wasn't busy! Everyone is of course, up at the cottage. Yay! Between the 4 of us we tried: Uova in Camicia (poached eggs on brioche, baby spinach, crispy prosciutto, fontina) Ricotta Pancakes Taglliata di Manzo (grilled flank steak, poached egg, arugula..)  It was delicious! Great spot. Great location. Service could have been a little tighter. I had to ask for coffee twice."}
{"text":"Five stars for the mafalde al funghi - up there among the best pastas I've had in my life.  Decor was modern industrial with some rustic touches. Would be both a good power lunch and date night venue."}
{"text":"I always have a lovely time when I go. The ambience is nice and the food selection is great. My biggest advice: order the Mafalde ai Funghi!! It's pasta with mushrooms and it's divine."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, most recently for my birthday. The restaurant gets busy but it's huge with two bar areas. So if you have to wait, one can find a way to entertain themselves. We got there around 8:30 and I put my name on the wait list. I was told 30 mins. So we headed up to the bar area and found a spot with no problem. I'm assuming you can order from the food menu at the bar as I saw people doing so but I didn't know that and already put myself down for a table. We got a table downstairs and its tight... And the tables are small. Our faves are the prosciutto pizza with hot oil and the mushroom pasta. Those items are just so good I've been not good at trying other things off the menu, I keep going when I get a craving! So I promise, next time I'll get the usual and something else =$  Ps- enjoyed the white house wine and reasonably priced"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday last year and had a great time! Atmosphere is great - bustling and loud enough to have a conversation without being overheard. Food was very good. Service was attentive and hospitable. They gave me a piece of cake for my birthday, which was sweet (in both senses of the word). I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Gusto 101 is a solid place when you aren't quite sure what you are in the mood for but want to catch up with old friends at a place with a cool, relaxed vibe.  Never had a terrible time here and it's got something for everyone.  I highly recommend the rooftop patio - both during the summer and the colder season. In the winter they have the retractable roof closed and its still cosy warm thanks to some heaters as well. Perfect date spot or having dinner/lunch with some close friends.  Great selection of wine, but I do quite like the wine on tap they have for $1 an oz. I personally don't drink a ton so having the option to choose my oz's is very much appreciated! The pinot grigio is actually quite lovely for house wine.  Food wise I love getting the grilled octopus. It's a sizable appetizer and great for when you aren't super hungry but need a little something. I've also heard the arancini, pasta and pizzas are all very good choices."}
{"text":"This place doesn't need any help from me given the endless lineups. Generally solid, reasonably priced food (for Toronto where 2 bite $30 entrees are the norm) in a beautiful industrial chic space (former auto garage). Delicious mushroom pasta where they don't skimp on the mushrooms. Branzino was a delicious perfectly seared piece of fish, generously sized with the tastiest pearl barley side that went very well with the dish. Kale salad with pine nuts was heinously over-salted which is too bad because you could tell the ingredients in it were top-notch. Everyone tries the buck an oz house wine - it's a solid B."}
{"text":"I came here for a dinner special occasion and it definitely did not disappoint.  I've heard people say that you must try the Mafalde ai Funghi pasta dish here and of course, I had to try it. The pasta dish was amazing. It felt like I was eating down a can of cream of mushroom soup in pasta form. It was delicious and I would definitely would order it again in the future.  The only down side is that is that it can get really, really loud and there isn't much sufficient lighting when it gets dark. I had to yell to talk to people in my party. It gets pretty dark in the restaurant after the sun sets and I had trouble seeing what I was eating.   The service was good in general. The waitress messed up our pizza order as the wrong pizza came to our table. She quickly fixed it but forgot to cancel the wrong pizza order on the bill and charged us for 2 pizzas when we had 1 pizza so we had to talk to her again to fix the mix up."}
{"text":"I get the hype. But I don't get the shady customer service/experience.   I called a week before for a group reservation. They told me I'd hear back in 24 hours. Didn't get a ring back, but didn't mind so I followed up 2 days later. I got the save message, that I'd hear back in 24 hours. At this point, I thought they'd get back to me quickly, but nah. So I called again and got the same non sense.   As this was for a birthday, my girlfriend decides to call. She get's the runaround and eventually gets snarky service from the person on the phone.  So again, cool that people like this place. But shady service."}
{"text":"Industrious and stone walled, the modern look of this restaurant is welcoming by lighting, music and service alike. On recommendation i tried the scallop and pork belly appetizer. The kale butter complimented the tender braised scallops perfectly. For a main I had the rigatoni licani. Local braised lamb with perfectly cooked noodles. Portion sizes were what you would expect from a restaurant of this style and as a result my excercise built up hunger was just under satisfied.. However the taste, quality, service and friendliness was more than sufficient for a five star rating."}
{"text":"I went there last night (Wednesday) for dinner at about 10pm and the place was packed. I got the feeling that it used to be an auto shop of some sort. The service was quite slow but it understandably so. The tables were too close together. They take orders with an ipod touch which in my opinion earns it a * on its own. The restaurant smelled so good almost like an oven roast turkey with gravy.  food pumpkin soup- 4/5 polipo (octopus)- 5/5 amazing carpaccio- 4/5 too many beans ravioli du zucca- 3/5 i compared it to bucca... and really there was no comparison Tagliata di Manzo( steak salad)- 4/5  repeat: yes, I think the restaurant has"}
{"text":"Gusto 101 seems to be the place to be.  Went on a busy night but was able to grab a table before the huge crowd arrived.  Lucky us.  Place was super cozy and seating was snug but doesn't matter when the food is amazing!!!  I must say the service here was incredible, The staff was very friendly and talked to us throughout the night and even stop by and poured our water when he say it was almost empty.  Back to the food.  We started withh the Polipo- grilled octopus, chimichurri, olive tapenade, piquillo purée, arugula and fried capers $14.50.  I am not a big fan of octopus but these were very good and not rubbery at all.  Next we got the Risotto al Nero - squid ink risotto, grilled calamari, hedgehog mushrooms, smoked paprika $17.95 We got a pizza to share - Diavola - spicy sun dried tomato pesto, calabrese salami, smoked provolone, roasted peppers $17.50 & finally all out favor dish - Mafalde ai Funghi - portobello, porcini, oyster mushrooms, truffle, cream sauce $17.50.    Wine was $1 and ounce I believe can pick from white or red.  We finished the night with some dessert which we didn't think was too good.  Dolci Platter choose 3 desserts for $15.50.  We ended up getting 2 Bread pudding and 1 something else I don't remember. Wasn't that good anyways.  I would go crazy with the entrees and skip the dessert here."}
{"text":"I have been to Gusto 101 about 50 times over the past few years.  A definite favourite for casual rustic Italian food. Good pizzas and great pastas.   PS. I recommend the house wines."}
{"text":"Stopped in here during my visit to Toronto. The downstairs was full so we got a few seats at the sky view (community) table upstairs. Excellent vibe! Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu. I ordered the Calamarata because the Lasagna was unavailable today. The pasta was a little undercooked for my liking - on the chewy side... BUT the shrimp tasted fresh, the sauce was great and the Russell sprouts I ordered were delicious! I could have taken down a few orders of those! I'd def come back here and try something else in the future. The warm, cozy yet bustling atmosphere felt good and active. Great way to start the night out in the 6! Ayeeee!"}
{"text":"I will keep this short and sweet.  If you are looking for a chill spot with great food, cool ambiance and good selection of drinks - this is the spot.  To top it all off, the prices are very reasonable and in terms of value, it is incredible. Very glad to have a staple like this in the area!  I highly recommend anyone to try this place AT LEAST once.  Pro tip : If your girlfriend / Boyfriend is angry - take them here. Good food can tame even the fiercest S.O's."}
{"text":"My husband and I first came here about two years ago when we visited Toronto for the first time, and had to come back. The atmosphere is outstanding, the service is top notch, and the food is delicious. We had our little one with us and our hostess was so gracious in being able to accommodate us when they were quite busy. Our go to items here are the Branzino, the Brussels Sprouts, and the Polipa."}
{"text":"I really like this place, especially upstairs. Great date spot. Food is good, staff and friendly and they have wine by the ounce! French fries are especially good."}
{"text":"The wait to just reserve for this place can sometimes take forever. I remember I wanted to try Gusto 101 for awhile but it took such a long time to get a reservation on a day that worked. Either way, glad I tried it and will definitely come back. I had the mushroom truffle pasta as well as some pizza and both were delicious but I must say, the pasta stole my heart. It was DELICIOUS and a must-try (took the waiter's advice and was not disappointed). Also a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Gustos. What can i say -- the mushroom pasta was slutty and orgasmic and I couldn't stop licking the plate. The wine suggestion was on point, and the pizza was awe inspiring, olive oil included. The \"Caesar\" salad with purple kale was fantastic, though the kale could have used a finer cut. The fries were floppy and the garlic aoili had a little too much vinegar, but still lovely. My main reason for the missing star is that the dessert was so sad. A cold, untoasted brioche bun with icy gelato and frozen peaches (the menu made it sound more exciting). It wasn't fresh and not worth the $$. But otherwise our experience was fantastic:)"}
{"text":"Two words: Mushroom. Pasta.  I can't remember the exact name but its the only one on the menu. If you love creamy mushroom pasta, check it out here.  The grilled octopus was slightly overcooked but otherwise enjoyable, and the beef tartare was nothing to write home about, standard affair.  Not to mention the $1/ounce house wine, whhhatt? I got a little happy buzz. The bread is delicious, weighty, doughy, crusty, yummers.  The staff are attentive and the food came in reasonable time. Would come again!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about this place so was very excited to try it out. I got the mushroom pasta which was recommended by my sister. So delicious!! They also have daily wine specials for $1 for an 1 oz. I went on a weeknight for a late dinner and I had to wait about 20+ mins. I believe they have two levels but I heard this place is always pretty crowded so expect a wait. Good for young adults and a good place to drank wine and food after work. The food is on the pricier side. Would definitely come here again for some wine and some italian food!!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand where all of these positive reviews are coming from. Upon reading these reviews we decided to give it a try. Came on a Sunday evening for dinner.   Pros - polite and professional servers   Cons -the food was overpriced and tasted nowhere near as good as the reviews mention. We decided to try the overhyped \"Mafalde Ai Funghi (mushroom pasta)\" which is cheap pasta mixed with mushroom broth and cream/sour cream (yes that's where the taste comes from). We also tried the \"Rigatoni Bolognise\" which wasn't any better. For an Italian place there is nothing authentic about these pastas. They shouldn't cost more than $8.00 each especially given the quality. The Carpaccio (raw beef) appetizer was literally just that. Raw beef with some prosciutto sprinkled on top for $15.00.  For those that actually like this place, you really need to get out more and try some real authentic Italian food. Definitely would not recommend."}
{"text":"The staff was kind and the food was delicious. As well, the decor of the restaurant is very beautiful -- I went for dinner and the ambience was lovely for a night out with family, friends, or even a date.  My favourite from the menu was the Cavolo Nero (their famous kale salad). I love it so much, I tried making it at home, but it just wasn't the same. I also ordered the Cavolo Caesar, which is tasty, but I prefer the Cavolo Nero.  But the crème de la crème at Gusto 101 is the Agnolotti di Zucca. Here's the thing, I'm not a pumpkin lover. I hate pumpkin pie, pumpkin spice, anything pumpkin . . . until I tried their pumpkin pasta dish. It was buttery, smooth, and decadent. So good that we ordered another plate!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed that gusto was a ho-hum dining experience. I met a friend here for dinner at 6:30 on the weekend, and she scored a table right away upstairs. The vibe of the place is great but the food was mediocre.  We shared the bruschetta which was unlike a traditional tomato dish but instead was served with mushrooms and cheese. It was good but needed some salt and thyme to bring out the flavours.  For mains - I got the bolognese and my friend ordered the burger. The pasta was cooked perfectly but the sauce was lacking all flavour. It tasted like the bolognese I make at home (so not good at all) and I had to drown it in chilli oil so it had a semblance of taste. My friend liked her burger but said it wasn't special. The fries were delicious.  She also ordered the mushroom pasta to go and we each had a bite of it before it was packed up - everyone raves about the pasta and it was good but again, not great.   The service was good - slightly slow at times but the restaurant was busy.   I wouldn't venture back here for a meal."}
{"text":"Hello ladies and gents. If you've been searching for a pasta dish to blow your mind, I'm here to tell you that you can find it on the menu by the name of Fettuccine ai Funghi. Now in Layman's terms, it's a mushroom pasta.  But wait! To all meat lovers out there who cringe at menu items that are labelled \"vegetarian\", I ask you to open your mind (and your taste buds) to the possibility of being pleasantly surprised at the wonderful simplicity of this dish.  It looks like Gusto changes up the pasta sometimes so it might not always be Fettuccine. Nonetheless, the combination of portobello, porcini, and oyster mushrooms, tossed in a light cream sauce with a rich and addictive truffle paste kinda makes you want to eat it regardless of what it's on... Thankfully, they do an incredible job with the pasta cooked al dente, so you're honestly left wishing that your partner was as perfect as this mushroom pasta.  Gusto 101 has a great vibe too. They have a rooftop patio which is enclosed by glass during the winter, which is nice for any special occasion. It's also casual enough to make it a place to go and grab a bite with your friends.  What are you waiting for? End your search for the perfect pasta dish and head to Gusto already!"}
{"text":"you can park your car in my garage  I was NOT in the mood to dine out.  But my dear dear friend Budgie dragged me out because she knew I could use it.  If you read my blog you'll know that I have been waiting for Gusto to open since news of this little italian eatery hit the line.  It opened in a blaze of glory and has been feeding the line of urbanites waiting.  It's become so popular (as has being a foodie in general) that people are name dropping it left-and-right.  When did restaurant name dropping become a thing?  Apparently now.  Gusto is triple threat, and one.  The 'and one' would be the spectacular rootop patio.  Mark my words, people with fight to get a seat come summer.    Converted from an old garage, I loved everything about the restaurant.  It's unpretentious, raw and industrial but welcoming and open (as in the kitchen.  I like to watch chefs work the line...gets my appetite going and one in particular got me blushing).    Gusto also has their own microwinery and serves wine by the 3, 6, or 9 ounces.  I didn't drink this round, but I'm pretty sure I'll find myself back in a few weeks.  I've read reviews about \"shady\" or \"poor\" customer service; I didn't expereince that.  Our server was knowledgeable, pleasant and charming.  I also read about hour longs waits; didn't experience that either.  Then again, much like going to see a movie on opening day, one should know better.  You eat outside peak hours on off days (i.e. Sunday night at 9:30 pm).  Budgie and I ate a lot.  The calamari, the carpaccio, a pizza, a pasta and two sides. We ate all of it.    For us it delivered in place and people, food, and price.    If I was in a \"better place\" that day I would have been more enthused, but seeing as it took a girl who didn't want any company and fed her right and made her smile, Gusto was just what I needed.  I need more than good food.  I need food that hugs."}
{"text":"Ate here twice. Food is great, love the rooftop patio and the staff is really friendly and great conversationalists.   Only problem is that this place is always busy and packed. 1.5 hr waits may not or not be worth it.   The rooftop patio gets really loud. I found myself yelling over my meal. But I would love to come back and the ambience and food + staff are great."}
{"text":"Saturday night (walk in only) 745pm wait time: 1hr 15mins even though we could see empty tables. We were a table of 3 for a Bachelorette. I would have given Gusto 101 a five-star rating were it not for the long wait time when there were clearly empty tables downstairs. We were seated upstairs and saw even more empty tables!   Once we were seated, we ordered right away, at this point it was 9pm. Our waiter was very pleasant; he promptly provided us with fresh bread, vinegar, and balsamic. The upstairs was quite cold but a relaxed atmosphere with lots of exposed wood. I kid you not the food came out within 10 minutes.   -House white wine: $1/ounce refreshing and subtle.  -Kale salad: highlight of the trip. Generous portion of kale with pine nuts, maybe raisins, and delicious parmasean  -Mushroom Pasta: creamy marriage of mushrooms, sauce, and al dente pasta -Bolognese pasta: was told it was delicious, with the lamb being the highlight."}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious, delicious. All of the food, though pricey, is delicious. Awesome, trendy atmosphere. Proximity to nightlife area of downtown. Just go!"}
{"text":"The Good: Everytime I come here, it's with the intention to order their house wine. Yes, admittedly, the $1 per ounce had me sold when I first found out about it over the summer, but their food is another reason for saving my appetite so I can order one of their well prepared dishes.  Must seat yourself on their patio when it's good weather. It can get a bit loud and crowded inside on their busy nights.   On my last visit, I shared the following:  - Tagliata di Manzo - flank steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and flavourings were lovely. - Branzino alla Griglia - the mix of veggies and fish was well done. Sea bass tasted fresh and juicy. - Green tea gelato - sweet ending to the the dinner. - each had a glass of house wine - white always crisp and it was perfect for sitting upstairs on their patio.    The Bad: The Green tea gelato would've been perfect if the cookie that came with wasn't stale.  Service really needs some improvement. While the ladies at the front who seat us have been generally helpful, the servers really can do for some more genuine smiles. I understand that this place gets busy pretty much every night, but waiting for someone to put in our order or in one instance, basically cutting off my friend when she was deciding on what drink to order by saying, \"I'll just come back when you've decided.\" was a bit rude in my opinion.   The Overall: Service aside, the food and drinks were great. Reasonably priced for a resto in the King District and conveniently located so you can always hit up another bar/club after.   Revisit: This is my go to place for drinks especially since it opens till 1am on Fri & Sat. How can you argue with $1/ounce wine? I would try having a get-together in their celler room."}
{"text":"This place is the definition of hipster. My boyfriend and I came here on Valentines Day. We made a reservation and we were seated upstairs. The setting was romantic.  To start, we ordered bruschetta, which was good. For our mains, I ordered the Mafalde ai Funghi (mushroom pasta) while my boyfriend ordered another pasta dish. Both were delicious. For dessert, we got the cannoli, which was good.  It was really busy and our waitress didn't check up on us almost at all. Also, after we paid, the waitress' mood became sour when she saw the tip. We thought that was unprofessional and she made us feel pressured to tip more for awful service. Overall, the food was good but not worth the mediocre service."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about Gusto 101, and I was excited to try it, but my visit last Friday night really didn't live up to my expectations.  I was out for a family dinner. It's quite a busy place after work on Friday, so I do recommend trying to get there early to get a place. We waited a while for a table for four, but we had a drink at the bar, so it wasn't time wasted. (Also, fun watching their bartenders mix up interesting drinks)  Our waitress and hostess were really friendly, but I just didn't feel that the food was that good. I was really disappointed by the bread. It was supermarket bread, and not what I would expect from a nice Italian place. For appetizers we ordered the octopus, the arincini balls, and the kale salad. The octopus was meaty and  smokey and delicious, but the rice in the arincini was underdone (as in hard center that gets stuck in your teeth underdone) and the kale was nothing spectacular.  I ordered the seafood pasta, and the seafood was overdone and rubbery.  Unfortunately my brother is allergic to pecans. He ordered the cheesecake for dessert, and didn't notice until he had a reaction that there were pecans in the cheesecake crust. He didn't tell the waitress that he had the allergy, but I also feel they should let people know when there are nuts in dishes, especially ones where you might not expect it.  They sell wine for $1 an ounce (but it isn't very good wine).   It was a very interesting looking space, and as I said, the staff was friendly, but the food definitely let me down.  Also, note that it is very loud. So loud that I couldn't hear those who were sitting across from me. Maybe not a great choice for a family dinner."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5 - it's decent, but not something I would wholeheartedly recommend.  I've been here twice. I can't explain it, but something seems off. I almost feel like I'm in one of those franchised stores. Except it's a crowd that's trying to not go to such a place.  Yeah - I'm being odd. I don't deny that.  As for the food - that's the 3.5. It's decent. The first time I had pizza - it was decent. My friend had the daily pasta (which I believe had lamb - that was actually really good), while my other friend's pizza was a bomb (flavorless). (much better pizzas include North of Brooklyn, Via Mercanti, and Mangia Bevi).  The second time I had salad. We also ordered a lot of appetizers. It literally lived up to being just \"decent.\"  You won't go wrong, but I wouldn't necessarily say that you went right either."}
{"text":"Dinner: Funghi pasts was really well done. Apps were great, they made kale taste good which is a hard thing to do.  Brunch: great presentation and taste, but options are limited.  Vegans or plant based eaters should avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm a people watcher. I am fascinated by people and their comings and goings. If you are like me, you will enjoy Gusto 101. Be sure to give yourself plenty of time to stand in line. It's popular.  I really enjoyed pulling up a seat at the bar and watching the bar staff work. They are friendly and charismatic. They also are quick to offer advice on food, drinks or life!   I really enjoyed the risotto balls and the salmon salad. I also enjoyed that at the end of the night when I was full of delicious wine, I could order wine by the Oz. (a buck an Ounce) Not the best wine you can consumer but definitely a drinkable table wine. I also think the price is right on everything and you will be sure to see some interesting characters."}
{"text":"Gusto, oh Gusto.  I've been here twice now and had 2 vastly different experiences. The first time, I had the famous mushroom pasta and it was divine. The second time (yesterday), I opted for something lighter as I'd had a big lunch, and went for the grilled octopus. The portion size, I was prepared for (it's an appetizer). Although I can get 2x the meat at other places, I assumed that at that price point, it would be something to write home about.  It wasn't.  The octopus was overcooked and completely bland. I've never salted food at a restaurant before, but I had to do it because it was just so.... not good. The sauces it came with made little sense too. The octopus was served on maybe two mini yellow potatoes, which just seemed wholly unnecessary at that point.  My one friend got the Bucatini Amatriciana (glorified spaghetti and tomato sauce), and my other friend ordered the burger (the aioli served with the fries left much to be desired). They both agreed it was decent but vastly overpriced.  At $1/oz, the Gusto house wine is a huge redeeming factor. The red is very tasty and they made sure to keep my glass full. Our server was also awesome - attentive and a total sweetheart. Those two elements saved the experience somewhat, but now I know - don't stray from the mushroom pasta. Just don't."}
{"text":"I've been to Gusto 101 several times at different times during the week, but the ambience and the food (I usually get a salad to share and the pasta with mushroom) were great every time! It's a popular place, so it has a liveliness to the restaurant, which I love. If you're looking for a cozy dinner, then go during the week, perhaps a table upstairs. If you're looking for the hustle and bustle then downstairs is for you. Don't get me wrong, you definitely can have a great conversation anywhere in this restaurant over amazing food. It gets busy, but it's not overwhelming. I've only had great experiences here so really, I don't have anything bad to say!"}
{"text":"My friends and me kept passing by this place which always seem full. One night we took our chance and swung by, the wait was 45-60 min. Should've reserved, but the great deal was, we went around for a drink and they texted us to let us know our table was ready. Genius idea!   Took the house wine and for 5$ a glass, I've had nothing to complain. We order the pasta with seafood and the plate was delicious and they weren't shy with the seafood. My friend took the pizza, it wasn't out of this world like we've been told but still great. Next time I'll go back for sure, but I'll reserve first. Great place the service was awesome, very friendly."}
{"text":"Clean and airy environment. Five stars for the interior.  Food had a classy touch to it. We tend to order a bunch of apps and they did not disappoint. The lentil salad stands out as a great taste.  Mains were nicely done. We had chicken which was moist and had lots of flavour.  The only thing that lacks is a bit of vibe/soul. This is why I took a star off.  Service on the other hand was near perfect.  Will come back to try different menu items.  Update 11.06.2017:  We were just here on a Sunday, place was packed, were told to wait 45 minutes for a table of six, table was ready in 15. Our toddler was out of control today, crying her eyes out, and the staff handled it so professionally, thank you. The food was amazing and I take my words back about the lack of soul, I obviously have not been here on a weekend day, awesome vibes."}
{"text":"Food was not anything special, but it was luckily edible. The rooftop space was a great place to be on a lovely Toronto summer day! In a nice spot tucked off the main drag (Queen) - that's worth a lot in my book."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Took forever to be seated on a Wednesday night after we missed the text msg notice. Bruschetta was more like grilled cheese with mushrooms than the Italian classic. Entrees were completely mistimed to each other so one person was served and the other waited. We sent the too-early food back after 5 minutes, waited another 15, then the first dish was overcooked and the late meal was chewy undercooked chicken. Bleh!"}
{"text":"Perhaps it was a (really) off day, but my latest visit to Gusto did not leave a good taste in my mouth. Ordered our favourite: Sea Bass, and it was a really sad looking plate, with unusually small pieces of flavourless fish. Also ordered the seafood pasta, a first at this establishment, and it was lackluster: bland and poorly plated. A friend had a the burger though, and he really loved it.   In previous visits the mushroom pasta and sea bass were mindblowing, the pizzas, extraordinary. But today, the food was just so disappointing.  The server and hostess were both charming though. So, there's that, at least."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on a Thursday night around 8:30pm. The wait was 45 minutes for 2 people, but luckily two people at the bar were getting up so we snagged those spots! The ambiance of this place is super cute and trendy. Large outdoor seating. Our bartender Jordan was super friendly and let us try a couple wine's before picking the one we wanted.  Wine: We got the Sangiovese bottle. It was good, but nothing amazing.   Food: We shared the arugula salad, margherita pizza and prosciutto pizza. All of them were delicious. The prosciutto pizza didn't have too much prosciutto flavor though. I personally like the margherita better. It was definitely enough food for 2 people.  I heard a lot about the mushroom pasta and would have liked to try it."}
{"text":"Very delicious food here. It's a great little restaurant dT with a very cool layout in what appears to be an old car garage or auto shop of some sorts. Very funky spot. They have a nice selection of Italian food options with fresh ingredients. It is pricey but a great choice when dT for a special outing or a date."}
{"text":"One of my go-to spots for good food that never disappoints.  Their fungi pasta is AMAZING and is precisely the dish which made me become a pasta convert.  I love their pizzas as the dough is not oily/heavy at all, slightly chewy.   Looove their spinach ricotta pizza, one of my favourites.  Recently, I've tried their gelato panini (pistachio geltato between a chocolate cookie sandiwich) which is amazing!!!    Super cute ambiance although it gets loud.  Will continue coming back!"}
{"text":"So I finally came here for the famous mushroom pasta, it was a weekday around 6:30pm and this place was PACKED and so loud you couldn't hear yourself speaking, we had to sit on the bar tables upstairs or else we would have to wait 45 min. Sitting on the bar stools were weird cause there was no where to put your jacket or purse, when people walked by us the chairs lifted up slightly cause I guess something in the floor was loose. I tried calling their number multiple times before so I could talk to someone but no one picked up, I ended up e-mailing them my questions which was much quicker. Our server was just OK I get why their customer service is shaky, the place is so packed that you may not be able to locate your server for a while. Nearby parking is $15 flat-rate which is crazy high, it was a rainy day and we ended up driving around for a while and found a parking lot further away for $6.  Food: Their bread is amazing (came room temp which I didn't mind)!!! Got the tuscan fries which was way too oily, small portion, the only good thing was the truffle mayo it came with. So the pasta comes out really fast and I see my husband has a huge portion and mine is about 1/2 the size which I thought was strange but overlooked since I forced him to travel 45 min to dine here. Once we started eating I felt underwhelmed cause it was luke warm and the pasta wasn't exactly al dente but a bit more chewy. I was slowly eating my pasta as I see my husband eating huge bites and steam coming out of his dish, he said his was really good. I was super confused cause we normally have similar taste and I felt like mine tasted like canned mushroom soup. I started to stir my pasta and I saw no steam at all while my husband's was pipping hot. I noticed right before we got our meals a couple near to us sent back their mushroom pasta and I was wondering if I might have got theirs?! I hope not but it doesn't make sense why my husband's was hot and mine wasn't, even his sauce was thinner and mine was thick and stuck to the plate! I tried a bite of his towards the end at is was amazing! We also ordered a coke that came in a small glass with a ton of ice for $2.99 and there were no refills so we had to get 2....  Overall the experience was way too hectic for me. Regardless of the hype; considering this pasta is NOW $18.50, just a month ago it was $17.50 and it started in 2012 as $14.95 it is definitely not worth it. Good restaurants are all about consistency so if you have the number #1 best-selling item on the menu, which periodically has a raise in price based on the demand of customers I would assume portion size and quality to be consistent. I will note that if I got the exact same dish my husband did I would have definitely given the pasta 4 stars. My overall experience with the noise level, unstable chairs and cold pasta is what brought me down to a 3.  TIP: Ask for their chili oil and grated parmesan, it really adds to the dish"}
{"text":"Made it to Gusto 101 today at 1 pm for lunch with my two co-workers.  They only take reservations at noon and 6 pm; otherwise it's all walk-in.  Sort of a unique concept, never seen that before.  My one friend got there about 5 minutes before us, and they let her sit at the table, which shouldn't seem like a big deal, but lately with the snobbery-movement at hip restaurants, I'm happy when things are like they used to be.  Service was strange.  Not bad, not good - just sort of off.  Examples: my friend had the hamburger and asked for mayo and ketchup for her fries.  \"We don't have mayo or ketchup,\" our server said, \"this is an authentic Italian restaurant.\"   The way he said it was so Terroni-esque, I had to check the sign to remind myself where we were.  Finally he said he could offer up some \"garlic aoili\" - uhhh, yeah buddy, also known as MAYO.  Later my friend found out something about me she didn't know and exclaimed, \"OMG, I have no idea!\" and he popped his head around and said, \"Oooo about what?\" like he was one of the girls - it was really weird.  Now the food.  Kind of a few dollars more for each dish than it \"should\" be (than it's worth).  Lots on the menu that sounded great.  The bread they bring out at the beginning is amazing. They don't give balsamic vinegar, just olive oil, so we salted and peppered our olive oil before dipping.  I had a moment of insanity and ordered a salad, very unlike me.  It was the chicken salad, and had mushrooms, goat cheese, roasted tomatoes.  HUGE portion but my problem was all the food was the same consistency - it needed both something crunchy (everything was mushy) and something acidic (everything was sweet-toned) to make it a good salad.  I got bored of it quickly.  Lunch for three with no alcohol was about $80.  Atmosphere upstairs was awesome but man, I hated those unisex washrooms.  And I was in the washroom when no one else was there, and I still hated it.  Creepy."}
{"text":"Solid. Pasta, sauté greens, octopus, pizza. Every one of the dishes our table of 3 ordered was fab.   And service? Friendly, helpful and considerate.   Go. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Been frequenting Gusto for a few years now and I'm never disappointed!  Food is as authentic as you can get and service is always friendly and attentive.. Order a nice cold bottle of Peroni to complete the Italian experience! Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"I'm really giving it two and a half stars but not at the 3 level. Came here on a beautiful sunny day after the raptors lost and I needed to eat my feelings. I've been wanting to come here for so long, and decided to stop by. They had a patio outside but it had a bit of a chill so chose to dine in. We were seated right away in this very rustic looking Italian restaurant. I was hoping their bar area would have had the game on but sadly it did not which was cool. They quickly took our order and gave us a basket of bread which was pretty hard and cold. I got their house white wine which is priced a dollar an ounce! It was very good and not overly sweet. Fruity taste to it. I ordered the mushroom pasta which I heard was a must try. Unfortunately it was also cold and undercooked. It was not at the al dente level and on the harder side. As well the salt level was way too high in my opinion. I really had high hopes for this place. My friend ordered the pizza and he did say it was ok. Decent service, nice atmosphere, and great wine, but will not be coming back for the food."}
{"text":"Gusto is almost as good as an Italian Restaurant gets, the service and the quality of food were above average. The only suggestion would be to simplify the menu. By just using fancy Italian names you don't make your menu more attractive, you rather make it more confusing."}
{"text":"We are a recurring customers to this restaurant. We enjoy the food and the atmosphere, but it can get very noisy and hard to have a conversation. It's a great place to hang out with friends or bring a date. The food is delicious. The food was always on point, and did not disappoint. whenever we go. We love the pizza and truffle pasta. The desserts are good too."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for Italian and were debating to try Gusto or Buca as they are located in front of each other. We decided to go for Gusto and try Buca next time.   We arrived just before 1pm on a Thursday and the place was packed. Most of them seems to be Business people on their lunch hour but there were also lots of couples and a few groups. We were told that it will be 30 minutes wait for a table or we could sit at a communal high table with two strangers. We decided to go with the latter as we were hungry.   If you are getting to this restaurant by car, the lack of parking spaces can be irritating. We ended up parking on the underground parking lot in the Goodlife building on Richmond Street West and walked a block and a half.   All of the tables are tightly together and there's no sense of privacy. Also, it can be a bit difficult to talk to each other as the music is pretty loud and the place noisy.   As other reviewers have mentioned, there's one bathroom downstairs with gender specific stalls for men and women with a communal sink and hand dryer. The M is for men and the W for women.   We went with Bucatini con Sugo di vitello, Calamarata con Gamberi and Margherita Pizza. They charged $4 for bread but we got it anyways. The Calamarata was the best dish as the tomato sauce along with the chilies helped to give it a little kick to the pasta. The pizza was solid. Very thin crust and light. However, the bucatini was a little disappointing. The taste of the anchovies becomes overwhelming as you keep eating the dish. I have been told that the Mushroom Truffles pasta is very good and maybe that's what I'll order next time.   Service was very good. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly even though the place was packed. Kudos to her! Prices are not cheap though and it might give people second thought of coming here.   I'll definitely want to come back during dinner time and try their daily specials.   Highly recommended.  #30 of 2018"}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday at around 7:15 pm, no reservation. It was really busy, but there was a table. However, the environment was extremely cramped, with about 6 inches between each of the small wooden tables -- not optimal.   The service wasn't amazing. Our server did offer suggestions when we asked, but he was slow to take our orders and when he did, he was busy trying to make an app work on his phone.  It may have been a serving app... all I'm saying is he was clearly giving IT more attention than US.   We ordered: The grilled octopus - I loved it, my friend thought it was too charred.  The meat was perfectly tender.  The Kale salad - Another winner. The kale was chopped up in small, easy to chew, pieces. Pine nuts, and currants gave the salad a very nice flavour.   The beef carpaccio - This dish looked amazing, but it was nothing special. I never thought I'd say this, but there was TOO MUCH truffle oil. I love truffle oil, but it was the only ingredient  I could taste in this dish. It might as well have been truffle oil on top of rice paper.  The Rigatoni with lamb - I'm  not a huge pasta eater, so I can't give this dish a fair review. In my opinion it was fine, nothing special.  If I went back and had pasta, I'd order the mushroom fettucini, it sounded delicious.   I don't know if I will return to Gusto, I really didn't care for the ambience. However it has a large patio, so maybe I will find myself back there eating octopus and Kale salad in the sun."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Great place to hang out with friends. Food is average.   What to do here: Make reservation at the roof top patio (on a warm day) to hang out with a group of friends. Order some fancy drink and catch up with each other's lives.   The patio has outdoor heating and cool sun roof for the first floor. Decor and vibe is fantastic. If sunny, bring hat and sun glasses with you on the roof."}
{"text":"Italian food is always great, especially in this place. Great food, decor, atmosphere, and service. I had the Mafalde ai Funghi (18.50) and Trota (23.99), which exceeded my expectations. The mafalde ai funghi had malfade pasta, portobello, porcini, oyster mushrooms, topped with a truffle cream sauce. The pasta was al dente and held the sauce really well because of its rectangular shape and curly edges. A pasta dish rich in umami and earthy flavour! The Trota comes with Steelhead trout, grilled zucchini, fresh peas, sea asparagus, squid ink fregola, mint, garlic chips chilies. The trout was grilled in a tuscan wood fire grill making the trout moist with a crispy skin! Squid ink fregola was complimented the fish really well, with its subtle umami taste. Good amount of protein, omega 3s, and complex carbohydrates. This is an amazing place for Italian food, would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Came here with colleagues after work. The food is delicious, I had the Branzino, a grilled mediterranean sea bass. It was crisp and delicious. The décor is pleasant as well, the patio is a must on a nice day! Waiting staff are kind, courteous and prompt. Overall a great dining experience."}
{"text":"I like the service here a lot.  I like the wines.  But I just don't have a lot of affection for the food.  On my second visit here I found little redemption. The pizzas here are tough,  floury crusts with no chew or crunch.  We had the fungi pizza and we both found it incredibly bland.  In fact,  most everything was under seasoned.  The rice balls were a bit on the cardboard side with a flat tomato sauce. Rigatoni bolognese was extremely dry and although the pasta was al dente ,  it seemed far too starchy and needed a good dousing of the chili oil they brought.  I like the chili oil very much.  Also,  no Italian woukd put a burger on the menu. I feel like the salads with pick your own protein are pandering to the downtown crowd to have dietary restrictions but are too lazy or privileged to toss up some greens and cook a chicken breast for dinner.  Sadly,  this model could be why they are so busy.   I've tried to like this place,  but in my opinion the food is not very good. I didn't hate anything,  but nothing had flavour,  personality or any Italian flair."}
{"text":"Lovely rooftop patio (under a glass roof) and a dinner or drinks.   I had the Risotto with calamari and squid ink and it was super tasty!! Others at my table were quite pleased with their food too."}
{"text":"When we first got there, I saw the waiter accidentally spill a drink all over a lady who was on a date with her husband. He was very apologetic and tried everything to make up for it - even offered them free cake (which they refused).  To us, his service was fine. No issues, no complaints.   The atmosphere was fairly comfortable (we got the whole back end with couches), but items on the menu were a bit pricy. The \"rooftop\" as they call it, isn't really a rooftop because it has a roof - so it still feels like you are inside, as opposed to a more patio feeling. The view was also of pretty much nothing.  The food was average, I got a burger. It was filling. Unfortunately they didn't give me enough ketchup for my fries, and by the time he brought it, I had already finished them (since it took so long!).  Overall, nothing really special about this place to bring me back again, but I'd go here if friends that I'm with want to."}
{"text":"Food was good, kale salad delicious, service wasn't good. Decor is high fashion, but so are prices. Since the pizza is better at other places nearby, where someone comes to check if you'd like chill flakes to perk up something bland, offers you coffee, and doesn't charge an extra $20 above the bill on the card reader, we probably won't be back soon. (It was refunded once we spotted and pointed out the mistake.) Too bad, in many ways this place is a stunner."}
{"text":"K, so I figured out how to get around the too cool coffee. They will steam the milk! Yes!  And I can't get ENOUGH of the kale salad. Its amazing."}
{"text":"I pretty much live here at this point. Everything on the menu is fantastic, the wine on tap is great. Also one of the coziest patios in the city, Gusto is a must."}
{"text":"What a flavourful brunch! Service is a bit slow (probably because it's SO busy and popular), but I can totally see why. Excellent ingredients, interesting menu items, and they certainly know how to season food! The burger looked amazing too. At least 3 other dishes caught my eye that I'd love to come back and try. Thank god they take reservations!"}
{"text":"We went there for our anniversary. the restaurant looks fun,  but the food is super average. we got Bruschetta which was good. Fries was ok nothing special. For our main, we ordered Mafalde ai Funghi and Rigatoni al Ragu' di Vitello. in my opinion,  the pasta should have been cooked more! for $75 meal that we couldn't eat 80% of it I will give 3 stars!"}
{"text":"This is a perfect place to WOW a friend from out of town! The wine on tap and tantalizing menu will keep impress and satisfy everyone. We started with hefty portions of wine by the ounce because, well, why not? The mushroom fungi bruschetta was our app of choice and with absolutely no regrets. She ordered the pumpkin ravioli and absolutely LOVED IT and I (and every other diner beside me) opted for the Friday night special. So good. I'm still thinking about that braised beef... Finishing off with more wine and an Americano was the perfect way to end the meal.  The restaurant was bumping and service was superb. I definitely recommend a visit and will most likely be back soon."}
{"text":"Gusto101 is my home away from home.  I'd say I eat there at least once a week!   The Mafalde so Funghi pasta is the best. I've tried other truffle infused pastas and this one outshines the rest by a long run! Their beef tartare is delicious and comes with Taro chips or crostini which makes a great pairing because of the added textured crunch.  Their octopus is ok. Too burnt tasting for my liking. I've had better. Bar Isabel is my go to for great octopus!  Their pizzas are delicious. Wood burning oven really makes the difference. The polpette and margherita are my favourites as is the Funghi :) Also people don't shy away from their chili oil! It's amazing on the pizza and kale salad. I put that S!$T on everything! Hehe   I tried their certified angus beef burger last week for the first time and I was in lust! Comes with escarola, mushrooms aged cheddar, roasted garlic aioli and a crispy perfectly salted side of tuscan fries. Honestly one of the best burgers I've had. Came perfectly medium rare. They actually take the time to ask you how you want it instead of bringing you an overcooked flavourless slab of beef on a bun! Lol   Their patio is fantastic and lively. Hard to get a table or resos after 6pm so people gotta remember \"the early bird always gets the worm\" at this spot!   Usually a good looking King West crowd and vibes. The 1$ an ounce wine is insanely good for house wine. They have a white and red selection and both are fantastic!   The ambiance and atmosphere is always relaxing to me at Gusto. Maybe it's the dim lit romantic thing they have going on but whatever it is... It works for me! After a long day at work, I find this to be one of my favourite relaxation spots.  It does get a bit loud so first dates may be on the more awkward side if you're trying to actually get to know one another and chat :)  The servers are super sweet and attentive. Always helpful and charming to talk to! Great job on service. Always a good experience.  All in all Gusto101 is amazing and a gem on the King West and Portland strip!"}
{"text":"5/5 for service and atmosphere.  5/5 for the Cavolo Nero - my favourite salad! It's always delicious.   2/5 for the Mafalde ai Funghi. I've had this dish before and remember it being wonderful. It was terrible today - the pasta was barely warm, rubbery, and there wasn't nearly enough sauce. The group next to me also got 2 servings of the same dish - theirs came out steaming and saucy. Perhaps it was a consistency issue? Pretty disappointing thought since I came for the pasta."}
{"text":"Great patio both up and downstairs! Did not stay for food but had a good selection of cocktails and wine. Not many selections for beer, so if you're wanting a beer, I would choose elsewhere otherwise great spot and great location."}
{"text":"I wish this was my local neighbourhood bar. This is the kind of place you want to come for afternoon drinks, stay for dinner and continue on until the night ends. It looks funky on the inside (converted warehouse type space) but this has one of the best patios in the city so why would you want to sit inside? Surrounded by shrubs and fairy lights, it's a nice spot to settle in.  I came here for drinks with a friend at about 11pm on a Friday night and we got there too late for dinner - however they have a late night menu, which includes pizzas and a couple of anti-pasto type plates, that's served until close. We ordered the prosciutto and arugula pizza, the base was thin and crispy and the toppings were fresh. Seriously yum! I thought it was a bit strange that the pizza wasn't sliced when it came out... not sure if this was an oversight by the pizza chef or that's just the way they do it? But, no biggie. If you're a wine snob you'll be happy with the pages and pages of options, or you could go with the $1 per ounce house wine. I didn't know about this until I read the previous reviews so I might try this next time. It sounds like a pretty good deal. Like other reviewers have said, yes the tables are close to each other, but this just makes for some fun conversations with the people at the table next to you (if you so choose to!). Our server was awesome and made sure our wine glasses were topped up whenever they got low. After sharing a bottle of wine and a pizza our bill came to $40 each including tip, so it's not exactly cheap. But, I definitely want to come back to try out the regular menu!"}
{"text":"Went here for a NYE dinner, got a table for two. Ate on the 2nd floor, which had an amazing view. The atmosphere was good, and we ordered a pizza and a lasagna. The lasagna was amazing, it was honestly the best we've ever tasted, it just melted in your mouth. The service was good too, we would definitely go back there again without a question. The food was a bit pricey, but well worth the taste."}
{"text":"Food: 7/10 -- Value: 6/10 -- Service: 7/10 -- Ambiance/Décor: 8/10  \"Underwhelming\" was the word of the day.   -- APPETIZER: Tuscan Fries ($7) Chipotle lime salt, tapenade aioli. It was a rather small portion with a non-existent chipotle lime salt flavour. The tapenade (olive) aioli didn't have much flavour either.  -- APPETIZER: Brussels Sprouts ($7) Brussels sprouts, black garlic butter, pancetta, vincotto. This dish came out warm, which made me question how fresh it was. Again, the menu listed a non-existent flavour because black garlic butter was M.I.A. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. Especially since I've had good Brussels Sprouts (Home of the Brave), this was a disappointment.  -- MAIN: Mafalde ai Funghi (aka Mushroom pasta, $17.50) Portobello, porcini, oyster mushrooms, truffle cream sauce. This was the best thing of the night. The portion is decently sized, but it's heavy and filling. I really enjoyed it.  -- MAIN: Spinaci (aka Spinach pizza, $18) Spinach, buffalo mozzarella, pecorino, fresh ricotta, garlic. This was a flop and again, the advertised garlic flavour was nowhere to be found. Spinach itself is not very flavourful, but even with three cheeses, the pizza fell flat. There was no kick, there was no surprise, no edge. I'd steer clear of this.   -- DESSERT: Dolci Platter (aka all three desserts: tiramisu, budino bar, gelato, $15.50) Of the three desserts, I liked the pistachio gelato the most despite it being rather ordinary. The tiramisu was a bit formless for me; I prefer ones that resemble more of a cake. The budino bar was like a dense brownie and I don't think it's worth its individual price of $6.50. In general, all three desserts were nothing out of the ordinary, but they were perfectly fine.  The restaurant itself is nice. Its dim and the décor has a rustic and industrial charm. If I were to nitpick, I'd say that it feels a little cramped, like there are too many tables too close together. Despite being an obvious standout, the mushroom pasta in and of itself would not be enough to convince me to visit or recommend this place. I wouldn't advise against visiting because the food was average at worst, but it's just not very special to me."}
{"text":"Not bad. Nice atmosphere. Good place to grab wine."}
{"text":"Had a small lunch at Gusto 101. A bit pricy for the type of food and portions you have but when you have a taste of the menu, the music change. The bruschetta (bru-sket-ta and not brushetta like the vast majority love to pronounce) was crispy and well balance. This bruschetta was labelled as \"Invernale\" (a winter version of the traditional one) was seasoned with marinated mixed mushrooms on toasted tuscan bread served along rapini, ricotta, taleggio, olive oil. The carpaccio was phenomenal: beef carpaccio was served with truffled cannellini beans, pecorino micro greens and truffle emulsion. The meat was very tender and delicate until you hit the truffle sauce that enhanced flavour enough not to cover the taste of the beef. Last but not least, the Polpo. This is a plate that requires lots of skills to cook: too much or too little and that would be a recipe for disaster. Not at Gusto 101. Cooked at perfection, the Polpo is a grilled octopus paired with chimichurri, olive tapenade piquillo puree, fried capers and green. So, what's the verdic? Two thumbs up. You want fresh and delicious food? You might want to consider Gusto 101"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, on a date and in a group and both were great experiences.  There is generally a wait, they do select reservations for noon and 7pm weekdays only. They do have a private room downstairs as well, there does seem to be a second floor but I didn't investigate.  Their house wine comes in a pitcher which we found to be cute. We had Bruschetta, Mozzarella di Bufala & Margherita Pizza for apps this last time and all were a unanimous hit. They split the Bruschetta, which comes in 3 pieces to 5 so everyone in the group could have an individual piece which was thoughtful.  The Trota was a well cooked piece of fresh Steelhead Trout, I thought a broader bean may have paired better but the flavour range in the accompanying acqua pazza.  Of my company the favoured dish was the Bistecca, though I didn't try it myself.  I think it's worth mentioning that the bathrooms are unisex. Which is fine by me. They are WAY too dark though."}
{"text":"Horrid, undrinkable wine that they have the temerity to feature . The white was okay (not good, but okay), but the red was as bad as I've ever had. The food seemed okay, but it was hard to concentrate after a couple of mouthfuls of the rotgut that passed for house wine. I'm not expecting a Robert Parker 98-point special, but this was stuff that should have been headed for the spit bucket before it ever got anywhere near a customer. Hip and noisy and boisterous atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was the cutest little hipster restaurant. My friend and I came for lunch and were not disappointed. We ordered the mushroom pasta which we were told was one of the most ordered dishes, it was amazing. We also ordered the pizza with roasted red peppers and salami which was my favourite part. Crispy crust and soft bendy slices, sooo good (better than Terroni's). We started with the rosemary sour dough bread which was unreal. They have fresh olive oil on the table for dipping. I wish I could go back now. The actual restaurant is two floors - when we went only the bottom floor was open and it was packed and squishy. The food was worth the squishyness tho. Staff was also great."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, both had steak and potatoes in a chipotle, red wine sauce.  Can't give it a better score because the seating is horrendous , you're literally six inches beside the next table.  When we go out we like to have a proper conversation, impossible here, you can hear the person beside you breathing. I realize the place is busy and they're trying to stuff as many people as possible into the joint but it leads to a diminished experience.   The  shitty seating leads to too many people in the restaurant which results in cold, rushed service.  Top it off with a open kitchen that has terrible ventilation and you have a cramped, stinky, uncomfortable environment.  Food saves this place, which is why, I assume, people keep going."}
{"text":"i LOVE this place. my go to dish is the fettuccine ai funghi. BEST mushroom pasta I have ever had!!  I will never forget my first time lol actually life changing.  The portion is huge for this as well and i always recommend it to everyone. The spinaci pizza is also fantastic.  there's fresh ricotta right on top that is to die for.    I gotta note that their appetizers are really small.  I've tried 3 of them and i personally think they should be shared between 2 people MAX, but really i could eat the whole thing myself.     The restaurant itself has super cool rustic decor and CUTE waiters who take your orders on ipods.  cool right? I love everything about this place, it's perfect to come here with your friends or on a date.  Also they give you free bread to start as a bonus. gotta love my carbs :)"}
{"text":"I would say im a regular here. I always get the burger & fries, and every time my mind gets blown away by how good it is. My wife always gets the mushroom pasta which is very mushroomy and flavorful. Service is great and the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"The smell of this place is what made us want to wait an hour for a table. That, and the cozy but trendy Italian kitchen feeling atmosphere. In a bustling part of town, it wasn't difficult to find a nearby bar to kill a bit of time. The lovely hostess assured us that she would text us once our table was ready.   The service was great, especially for a busy Friday night. We had a pasta dish and a burger and split the two entrees between us. Overall, more than enough food with just enough flavour.  I'd return to try a pizza...or the pumpkin and sage ravioli!"}
{"text":"Came by for dinner over the long weekend when I was visiting my cousin and she suggested Gusto. There's a lot of indoor seating and additional outdoor seating on the second floor, but we were lucky enough to get a spot on the lovely front patio on a busy Friday night and we just spent the entire night there, ordering pitcher after pitcher of sangria.  The food was delicious, and the service was great and very accommodating to our party of musical chairs throughout the night. We ordered a lot of things to share but my favorites were the Mafalde ai Funghi (mushroom pasta) and the Spinaci (Spinach and Buffalo Mozzarella Pizza). The pasta was so good, aldente, lots of mushroom flavor - and it was so good that we ended up ordering another one."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a veeeery long time and so glad I finally did. Came on a Sunday evening and sat on the rooftop patio. The patio is great minus having to walk down two flights of metal stairs to get to the bathroom.   Ordered the cavolo nero (kale salad) and mafalde ai funghi. These two were the perfect combo of something light and refreshing with creamy and heavy. The kale salad was one of the best I've ever had. It was massaged to a perfect softness yet remained crunchy. The dressing was more on the sour side, but I loved it as it was a great compliment to the pasta. The pasta was perfectly al dente. I loved the chewiness of the noodles and the creamy mushroom sauce with a hint of truffle flavour. There was something really addicting about the noodles and I kept eating and eating without taking a break. The one off-putting part of the meal was that I'd get random bits of rock hard mushroom. One of my least favourite things while eating is when I crunch down on something I shouldn't be (ie. egg shell, grit, bone or anything hard). Although overall it was a delicious meal, I didn't leave feeling the need to come back right away."}
{"text":"The place is pretty typical for King West -- filled with young people, loud, lofty-like interior, nifty patio etc.    To start we had their house red wine - it was DELICIOUS.  One of the best wines that I have had in a long time.  Our waiter was really nice and attentive.  Everything seems to take a lot time to get out of the kitchen, even the wine.  But as long as the food is good, it could take forever!  Our main dishes were really yummy.  My friend had a pizza and I had the ricotta ravioli.    However, our desserts totally ruined the meal!  We had the apple doughnuts and the white chocolate risotto with pumpkin.  The doughtnuts were good but I was expecting a warm doughnut!  They were cold and sticky-like.  And the risotto was dry and chalky, not too flavourful and totally not sweet at all.  I love dessert and this place did not deliver.  In fact, we left half of the risotto because we found it pretty blah.  This made me sad, because my main was quite good!  The patio is great and our server was nice.  Even the people at the front were nice enough to bump us ahead, but Gusto 101 until you fix your desserts you won't be seeing much of me!"}
{"text":"Not very friendly to a single diner. Sat at the bar for lunch and ordered a kale salad and a dessert. Completely ignored by the bartender and kale salad was not good so sour. Dessert was laughable. Taste worst then Costco. They put a lot of money into renovations but should spend more on training staff."}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance. Love their pasta selection, but grilled optopus was not executed delicately enough to have the right texture."}
{"text":"Haven't been able to stop craving the mushroom pasta. Seriously best pasta dish I've ever had. The tartare was really good too! $1/ounce for wine. Great atmosphere for a nice dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"Big reputation.....big disappointment. To begin, food was mediocre. For the price point and the rep, I expected something far better executed than what was delivered. arancini was meh, beef tartare was bland and when dipped in the sauce provided, tasted overwhelmingly of truffle and nothing else, and pumpkin ravioli was mushy and unremarkable. Not only was food far below average, service was dismal at times and borderline intrusive at others. When I put my dirty, USED knife on my plate for the waitress to clear, she removed it, and insisted \"dont you want to keep your knife?\" Um, no? If I had wanted to keep it I wouldn't have explicitly placed it on the plate you were clearing. Cocktail was inedible, tasted like a Tim Hortons bran muffin and bad whisky. The waitress also forgot to punch in our order for the main course and blamed it on \"a mixup in the kitchen\", only to have the dish come out 5 mins later. Food runners dropped plates in front of us without a word of what the dishes were. We had asked for the bread to be removed, the runner tossed it on top of my main course. To top it all off, we were offered \"dessert on the house\" to make up for the shortcomings, only to be presented with a cold, soggy, tasteless tiramisu, which I would bet has been sitting in the fridge for a week. AND big surprise, we were charged for the tiramisu at the end of the meal. Disappointing. Waste of money. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Have you ever been to a store that the sales person is all over you that you get annoyed and leave the store even though you really like some of the cloths? I had the same feeling at Gusto 101. I guess they were just trying to be hospitable but they definitely overdid it. There was a waitress and then there was a hostess that asked us if everything was OK every 5 minutes and/or if they should take our plates away.  It kinda felt like they were rushing us. They're using this great app to take names for the waitlist and orders, which is awesome, but the fact that waiter would just stand over our table to put the orders in on the app for 2 minutes after we ordered just made it too uncomfortable.   I went there because I really wanted to try their on tap wine, but they didn't have any of the red wines so that was another disappointment.  The restaurant itself is beautiful, great design, and I'm sure once the patio opens it'll be a great hangout spot for a lot of people in that area. But inside is just too loud and too hot.   Food was good. Nothing crazy though."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great and the food is delicious and plated beautifully. My experience here has always been positive and I would highly recommend it if you're looking to try some excellent Italian food!"}
{"text":"So my dad was visiting from abroad and we wanted to have some lovely Italian food, went to Gusto 101 on a Tuesday at 8 pm, the place was packed full, however the waiter was nice enough to squeeze us in a small table. We ordered the Arancini, they were ok, not the best i had but they were still good. we also ordered the Carpaccio which was amazingly good with loads of flavor and spices. As for the main course we ordered the following items: Mafalde ai Funghi for my dad, he loved it and had was a good portion for 1 person. Me and my husband ordered a pizza each: Polpette & Prosciutto e Rucola they were both amazing, but really large portions so i would advise working on your sharing skills and order 1 pizza and more appetizers."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat pizza. I've tried different kinds and they are all very. The place gets very busy in the evening and there is usually a wait but it's worth it. Atmosphere is nice, busy. The service is good. Nice decor and ambiance. Very lively."}
{"text":"Came to dinner here with a party of 3.  Great place for sharing plates and a bottle of wine (they range from $40+ and are almost all italian wines).  The beef carpacio was the best I've ever had, highly recommended.  Great pasts and friendly service.  A bit loud, but seemed like they could accommodate larger parties."}
{"text":"I went here once for dinner on a Friday night. Let me assure you, I will NEVER step foot in here again!   The noise level in here was atrocious! I could not hear anything anyone at my table was saying unless they yelled into my ear! This \"restaurant\" is more like a club atmosphere based on the extremely high noise level and industrial appearance. My ears were actually ringing for a couple of minutes after we stepped out.  The food itself was mediocre at best. There is not a single dish worth the visit to this place.   It is not a place you go to for an enjoyable, relaxing dinner.   It's also not a place to go to if you'd like to be able to get out of your seat without encroaching on the personal space of the people sitting behind you.   To summarize, only go here if you enjoy feeling claustrophobic and don't plan on conversing with your date/friends."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Slow service yes but only because it is so bustling with activity:) I had the glorious bruschetta that tasted like bacon on toast. Nothing wrong with that especially if there is some cheese and wilted greens thrown in.  I followed a tip and got the Fettucine Funghi.  Gloriously perfumed with truffles and chick full of earthy mushroom.  Heaven:) my good friend had the sea bass which was textbook good except the fish was a little dry.  It is loud.  It is happening.  But it is a place to be and be seen and have good food.  The $1 per ounce wine was a good tip:)"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends. I like their glass ceiling and modern freestyle decor. It would be very nice to have a lunch in the greenhouse with sunshine.  I ordered Mafalde ai Funghi. Definite my favourite! Strong truffle oil flavour, delicious ~"}
{"text":"The food is great here! The pizza, octopus, and the pasta is a must try. The only thing I noticed was that the service was not up to par. Had to wait awhile to get water, food, my bill. Ive been here a couple of times and it seems like the service is getting worse by the day."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian food and you definitely can't be mad at the $1/ounce house wine (the Rosso is smooth and the white is fruity, both are amazing to pair with your food choices). We were able to make a reservation at 6 pm very easy on a Wednesday (tip: you need to make reservations with a third party company but I experienced no issues). The service was amazing, with my table receiving our mains 10 minutes after ordering.   I ordered the Diavolo, which was not too spicy but full of flavour. Make sure to have the server bring you Chili oil so you can drizzle it over your pizza! This definitely brought the pizza from a normal pizza you would get at any Italian restaurant to an unforgettable experience. One of my friends ordered the mafalde ai funghi and loved it (warning: portion size is smaller than a typical authentic Italian restaurant). My other friend ordered the Regina Margherita and said it was very good. The crust on both pizzas was exactly how it should be: crisp and airy!  I would definitely come back to Gusto 101 for a nice night with my friends in the King Street West area again!"}
{"text":"I thought there was no way it could meet the hype but it really did! Amazing flavours, great service, and a beautiful restaurant.  Went here on a Wednesday evening without a reservation, which is apparently risky business. At 6:30 we were given the only available cramped seats in front of the bar, which was honestly fine by me. The restaurant did get very loud however and it was difficult to talk to my friend even though we were squished right beside each other.   The bartender at the front doubled as a waiter. He gave us great suggestions on drinks as well as the food. It seems like all the staff are well trained on the menu as he was even able to recite the ingredients in our salad when we asked! Really great and speedy service.  We ordered only 2 dishes. The funghi pasta and the kale salad. The funghi pasta has got to be my FAVORITE pasta ever. It was honestly love at first bite. The thick al dente noodles had the right amount of bite. And the amazing aroma of truffles still resonate in my nose. And oh my gosh the SAUCE. So creamy and flavorful. While I usually feel like I need some sort of meat to complete my meal, this was not the case. Every bite was so appetizing! HIGHLY recommend.  The kale salad was also very good! A bit steep in terms of pricing but I think it was a good portion and really nice flavors. I believed the kale was steamed, long enough to bring out flavors but not be soggy. There was also a combination dried currants, pine nuts, and lemon. I'd say it was quite robust yet balanced in flavour.   Lastly, may I mention they have $1 per oz wines? I definitely wouldn't consider myself a sommelier by any means but I really enjoyed my cold glass of sauvignon blanc along with my meal.   Overall, its really an aesthetically pleasing restaurant with amazing food and service but super loud!! Great as a hangout spot but I wouldn't bring a date!"}
{"text":"I went there for my birthday dinner, and my sister wanted plain penne so the server tried his best to do it so she got rigatoni which is long penne and she liked it. It was great. I had the rigatoni lucani and it was delicious, the lamb in there I thought was cooked perfectly. The fries had an amazing seasoning on them and they were scrumptious. The ricotta was amazing, it was this great ricotta with herbs and olive oil and it comes with a nice Tuscan style toasted bread then you spread the ricotta on the bread and it is soooooo good. The meatball pizza was perfect it had a thin crust with lots of meatballs .it was a good price ,it was casual but amazing food. Overall I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Walked in Monday night, my friend was told the wait would be 20 minutes.....the hostess then tells her she has seating available upstairs that's communal. When I got there I was awkwardly standing by the door waiting for someone to show me in, greet or at least smile??? Employees wearing gusto shirts did not even acknowledge me. I've had many previous work parties upstairs, so I knew where to find the stairwell and let myself wander around. Service was slow...(it was also Monday) Wasn't told about any house wine. Ravioli didn't taste fresh. Kale salad was AMAZING! Like always."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed this place.   We came on a weekday 7pm-ish and it was already packed inside. They do have a bar area on the second floor which was a lovely rooftop patio.  What I really liked: - beef tartare - great flavours that were not too heavy - kale salad - bigger than I expected. Great flavours that balanced the bitterness of the kale. The dressing was light and didn't over power any of the flavours - mushroom pasta - loved this! It was wonderfully creamy and aromatic  What I thought was OK: - prosciutto pizza - all right, not my favourite toppings (arugula too bitter and prosciutto too salty for my liking) but the crust is very crispy and thin which i loved  Overall, great atmosphere and great service. Definitely a place I would like to return!"}
{"text":"It's all been said already.  It's hip, it's delish, and isn't pretentious.  Good portions.  And fall in love with the mushroom pasta.  Everything coming out of the kitchen looks amazing.  I will come back till I try everything.    Only complaint is that it's too busy.  Line up can get nutty."}
{"text":"Go for the mushroom pasta and $1/ounce house wine. It's evidently not for everyone but this spot is different from your usual Italian cuisine. They make an effort and it shows. Food was great, wine was fantastically priced and tasty. What are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Very nice patio to go to on a summer afternoon .. Italian food almost always a good choice .   It was odd , I went to Nervosa at Yorkville recently & when i came here I realized it was the exact same menu and everything.  Turns out its the same owner, but why different name for the restaurant, i dont know.   Anyhow,  food is pretty good. I ordered pretty much the exact same thing at both places because Im not familiar with the rest of the italian described food on the menu    The bruschetta is a total win for mushroom lovers , soooo good. But small portion, 3 pieces.  The carpaccio was not amazing, but very good.   The mafalde ai funghi pasta , I love the sauce and mushrooms. The pasta feels a bit undercooked but I think thats how its supposed to be maybe ..  & we got the diavolo pizza and the prociutto,  Not too bad.   This is def a pricey place for the portions  But very tasty nonetheless.   Pictures posted  Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"My date and i walked in and scored a spot in the patio on a busy night. We both shared the beef tartare, octopus and mozzarella, paired with La Dama red wine and the Manarello cocktail. The pairings were exquisite, the patio was beautiful and the vibe was lounge like which I loved."}
{"text":"Was brought here by a date during the past summer for the first time. Super busy during the days of summer, to which we had no reservations. The hostess told us the wait for a patio seating would be about 40 minutes, but ended up seating us after 25-20 minutes.  We sat upstairs in the patio, the ourdoorsy decor had a nice rustic, casual yet romantic rooftop lounge feel to it. We ordered the kale salad, which to this day i order overtime i go , their appetizer size pizzas (i forgot which but i think that tells you how much I'm not really a fan of it) and their seafood shrimp/scallop pasta linguini.   For drinks, we order their sangria which was good but i felt like the pitcher was a little smaller than average pitcher sizes. It had only served us each a cup and a half.   The desserts are alright, nothing amazing or spectacular.  even my own waiter did not really love any of their desserts (shh)   Overall, ambience, vibe, decor, food - i would do 4 stars. Service - 3.  I would recommend this place for a small party get together with friends or a casual date night!"}
{"text":"Great Italian in a great neighbourhood! We found ample seating available even with our reservation at 6 pm.   We had to try the most-raved kale salad to start. It did not fall short of what I expected! I'm not a huge fan of kale but found this beautifully sweet and delicious. Overall, great appetizer! We then ordered their specialty mushroom pasta, and after many disappointing mushroom pastas at other places, I found this one the best. Nice and creamy, with pasta cooked to perfection, and the truffle making it just right. We tried the tiramisu for dessert and would recommend it to anyone, even if you are full! The tiramisu is small, so best to get one for yourself - you won't want to share!"}
{"text":"Mushroom pasta and margherita pizza were filling and delicious! Sit upstairs if you can!!!"}
{"text":"After seeing so many great reviews of Gusto 101, my boyfriend took me here to celebrate my birthday yesterday. We were both so excited to try the place but the overall experience didn't leave us with the desire to go back.   I had checked online to make reservations however they function on a first come, first serve basis after 6pm. We arrived around 7pm to a packed house and thought we would have to wait long for a table. Fortunately, there were some seats available! We had the option to go with the dining table or upstairs at the bar. We chose the dining table. We were seated at the back and the lighting was darker which didn't allow for great pictures :(   To start, we ordered some drinks - Mojito 101 and a  Caesar, extra spicy. Both of us really enjoyed our drinks! It was different and unique. My Mojito had an interesting amount of sourness to it that I enjoyed. The only thing about the Caesar that we didn't like was the rim seasoning.   For food, we ordered the Malfade ai Funghi and the Diavolo - both were recommended by our server. Since it took awhile for our food to come out, another server apologized and brought out some bread for us to eat while we waited. Bread was nothing special. I was SO excited for my pasta and really enjoyed the texture of the pasta and the overall dish. The mushrooms were delicious! In comparison, my boyfriend didn't enjoy his pizza as much. He wasn't able to finish his serving and we were able to pack it to-go.   The kicker that made this experience less than stellar is that we were charged for the bread that we didn't even ask for! Overall, a decent place for Italian food but not really sure if it warrants the hype. The food is good but nothing to be blown away by."}
{"text":"This is one the cosiest restaurants and the food is just amazing. The Burger is a unique truffle based taste and unlike any burger elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went to Gusto 101 with a party of four on Nov 12th 2013.    Here are the pro's and con's of the food we ate:  We had the Escarola and Insalata a-Gusto salads.  Both were very light and tasty.  The bruschetta Guanciale e Taleggio was an inoffensive warm heap of spinach on a crusty piece of bread, although the thinly sliced beef cheek was way too tough and bland.  The Branzino alla Griglia was not really to my liking; the sea bass was overdone and flavourless.  The Pollo al Mattone was tender, but served with rapini (I don't like rapini, but my friend does).  The Risotto al Frutti Di Mare was a good tasting risotto.  Finally, we had a dessert sample platter.  Of the four desserts presented, the Sticky Toffee Pudding and the Tortino di Mele were 5 star winners!  We sat upstairs and the ambiance was young and trendy.  Our server was Italian and full of enthusiasm (forgot his name) and tried to sell us a bottle of the house oil that came with the free starter bread.  We went right at 6pm and it wasn't busy, but an hour later it was hard to see an empty table.  Overall, I would go back for the dessert in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"We came for Sunday brunch. you have the option to sit on the 2nd floor that is open air during the warmer months, which was a nice touch!  We got coffees, the prosciutto pizza and some egg scramble that looked amazing. Prices are fair - the pizza was great. The crust was really good. The atmosphere is super chill and fun. I've been here for cocktails later in the evening and it seems to be a great spot!"}
{"text":"The pumpkin poppy seed agnolotti was amazing. The dozen people crowded by my table and bar was not. Make a reservation."}
{"text":"This place is a good place to have some comfort food. My favorite is the mafalde ai funghi pasta. It has never failed me yet. Creamy truffle flavored mushroom sauce with fresh made pasta for dinner in the winter is perfect. I recommend the octopus appetizer as well if you are a fan of seafood"}
{"text":"This place is always packed - and they don't take reservations.  Great vino deal, amazing ambiance and delicious food, no wonder they are always packed.  ANTIPASTI - We started out with CAPRACCIO, which was a good share plate, was delicious infused with a lemony flavour.  If you like raw meat, this is the dish for you, they did it very well.  INSALATE - we balanced it with a very light, and refreshing CAVOLO NERO - kale and nuts, it was very well done, this is a great side dish to break up any richness of other dishes.  We had this with the pasta and it worked out really nicely.  MAINS - we did a  PIZZE, the SALCICCE.  This was a bit spicy, tomato-y and sausage-y.  It had a bit of tang and was was a good size, like a small pizza - good to share or eat on your own.  PASTA - our lovely server recommended a great pasta dish: PAPPARDELLE AI FUNGHI - they used shaved portobello mushrooms mixed into some FRESH homemade pasta, this was the best dish out of all the dishes of the night and I highly recommend.  BEST OF ALL - $1 for 1 Ounce of VINO bianco or rossi.  WHATTTTT, you can drink a glass of homemade wine for 6 dollars, for a nice restaurant - that is amazing.  And it was delicious too, it wasn't like normal homemade wines, which are ghetto, sharp and intangible.  The ambiance is good.  If you want to go, you must go early or during the week.  I've attempted to go on a Sat night for dinner - I went at 9 and the wait was 1.45 hours!  Fun people, great looking crowd, definately fun on a night out on the town."}
{"text":"Honesty one of the best patios in the city!!! We had drinks here around 7pm, and it was gorgeous. By nightfall, the lanterns went on and it was even more breathtaking. I also appreciate how they don't rush you out here.  They do not take reservations, and when we asked for a table, they originally told us an 1.5 hour wait. Fortunately they texted us 10 mins later that our rooftop table was ready!   Would definitely go back to gusto, and would recommend it to anyone looking for an impressive date spot, or a place to chill with friends!"}
{"text":"Our friend Asad waited for an hour and passed up three open tables to wait for us to meet him here so five stars to Asad for being such a pal. A long those same lines, a big thank you to the waitress who let me charge my phone. That was clutch. Also clutch, the same waitress poured the wine into my glass for me which doesn't happen everywhere. I like any place that is conducive to idleness.   I was confounded by how many different dishes they had here and the decision to get the margherita pizza over like a pasta dish was one of the most difficult decisions I had to make while visiting Canada. I even went for the upgraded version with bufala cheese instead of mozzarella which I learned from a previous restaurant (see Ovest review) is much more titillating than the everyday mozzarella cheese. Fuck it. I'm on vacation.   I really put away the pizza, let me tell you. I was basically done before everyone else and I even had a slice of Laura's prosciutto packed pie. Both were as good as any other pizza of the kind that i have had, which makes me think that they shouldn't have two versions of the margherita. Just have the bufala version so that you don't have to make a decision that could change the course of your dining experience (and life).   We drank a lot while trying to decide where to go next and I think we had anywhere between 3 to 6 bottles of wine by the end of the night. We really made a home here and felt most welcome to overstay our welcome. As Gemma Malley once said: \"Because no one needs to live for ever. I think that sometimes you can outstay your welcome.\" We took that to heart and Drew started giving everyone (including the waitress) signature readings; like palm readings but with your John Hancock. I found out I love my family. Who knew?!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went around 9:30pm on a Saturday night in September.   It was packed on the patio, 1st and 2nd floor. The wait was an hr. We decided to go to the 2nd floor and sit at bar tables around the skylights (these seats are first come).   Loud atmosphere since it's Saturday night but it's expected anywhere.   Food: It was good.  - Bread & Oil: Their bread was really good.  -  Spicy Pizza (I forget the name): My boyfriend said it was the best pizza he's ever had! - Margarita pizza: It was good.  - Tiramisu: amazing!!  Prices: About the same anywhere else. Not super cheap but the average price.   Overall a great experience and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"I've returned a few times and the service and food have been consistently good. The kale salad and mushroom pasta dish is always a winning combination. I'll regard my earlier incident as a one off bad experience."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Queen West.  Everything on the dinner menu is excellent.  Brunch menu needs work:(."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. Although I love the ambiance, decor, and the food... I wasn't a fan of the service. Once we had arrived, it took a while for the host(ess) to notice us and have us seated. After ordering there was some confusion and delay as well.   The food was really good.... we ordered the charcuterie board and I think the Diavolo pizza. I loved the cured meats (every bite!) and the lightness of the pizza.   The drinks are really good too! I've been here on a couple of late nights and the patio is the perfect place to be on a warm summer night."}
{"text":"I probably wouldn't return to Gusto 101, but that's simply because it doesn't suit my preferences re: atmosphere. Even by Toronto standards, the two-top tables are EXTREMELY close together, meaning you're always bumping in to the other parties, and it's so noisy you have to shout at the person sitting just across from you. That said, it's a perfectly fine restaurant and we enjoyed our meal. We're just old cranks who like a quieter place.  We ordered the mushroom bruschetta, the diavola pizza, and some of the house wine. The wine is $1/ounce, which is way cheaper than what most restaurants charge, so we both had a glass of the red. It was medium bodied, had some berry tones, and went well with our pizza. Our server kindly gave us samples of their house wines ahead of time, free of charge, and we both agreed that the white tasted like fizzy nothing. You only get three pieces of bruschetta for $14, and I wished they were a bit more seasoned, but the bread was crispy and the mushrooms were yummy. The pizza more than made up for most of the spot's failings: it had the perfect airy, thin crust, just the right amount of cheese, and great flavor from the sun dried tomatoes. One pizza was just enough for two of us.  Our server was also very kind and attentive. When we noticed that she'd accidentally charged us for an extra glass of wine, she apologized and offered to give us cash back right away, since we'd paid with a card."}
{"text":"Love this place, great food, great service, great wine and doesn't deflate the wallet.  And it's a cool place in what used to be a garage.  Carpaccio and Buffalo Mozzerella are fantastic."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now (although I still haven't had brunch yet). My more recent visit was a dinner sans reservation. Although it was a busy Saturday evening, we did not have to wait more than 15 mins to get a table in the upstairs. We were seated comfortably, and the server had come by to ensure we knew what dishes were recommended and answer any questions we had. We ended up sharing the arancini and getting the Mafalde ai Funghi (the mushroom pasta that's such a big hit with this place). I have to say that the arancini was just okay. Nothing special there. The mushroom pasta is everything everyone's ever raved about it. If you like mushrooms and creamy pasta, this is for you. The atmosphere is cozy and intimate. A great date spot, casual or otherwise, and the perfect spot to catch with friends. It can get quite packed, especially when the weather is nice and they have great wine deals so it's a no-brainer that this place would always be in demand. While there is nothing wrong with this place that I can think of, I'm still not sold on it, and I'm hoping a couple more visits (including that elusive brunch) will help sell me :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! From the decor to the food to the vibe! If you're into cool, hip places this will be your jam! My friends and I split the Invernale pizza as an appetizer to start. The pizza consists of: butternut squash, sautéed greens, fior di latte, marcona almonds, castelvetrano olives and strcciatella. It was definitely a pizza to remember in a good way! For my main I ordered the Malfade ai Funghi which had 3 types of mushrooms (portobello, porcini and oyster) in a truffle cream sauce. This has got to be one of the best things I have ever eaten in my life!!! I would recommend this to anyone. Whilst eating I didn't want it to end!! Service was great as well, despite it being packed to the rafters. I couldn't recommend this place enough, I will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Lunch on the patio, sipping on a mimosa! It is a no-brainer spot that will work for any situation; business meeting, first date, to grab a solid meal, or take in the view!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Food is amazing..especially the octopus and kale salad. The $1oz wine is a great deal. Fun vibe, but I would add the most is a touch too loud upstairs"}
{"text":"Gusto is beautiful. It's rustic and modern decor and menu is perfect for lunch on King St. West or for a post-work drink. Love their squid ink risotto or their wood oven pizzas. The servers are friendly and the food is quick. Highly recommend sitting on their upstairs patio if they have room! This place is picturesque to say the least."}
{"text":"Walked in for lunch and didn't realize they also did brunch - so exciting!  My friend and I both ordered lunch (mine with modifications to remove meat) and the order was messed up. The waiter came right over when he realized, offered to let us keep the extra order and put in a new one for the meal that wasn't included.   Not two minutes later the manager came over to apologize and tell us that the meal that was messed up would be on the house.   The waiter apologized another time and even brought out extra food for me while I waited on the brunch pizza.   Can't even describe how impressed I am with the customer service here! Plus the food was to die for.   Also worth checking out the patio up top, there's tons of space!   I'll be back probably way too often."}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-3 Service-5 Food-3 Strikeouts-0/3  First of all, this place is over-hyped, definitely social media played a role here and got this place's name so famous that it's really hard to get seats for walk-ins. My friend reserved us one day, and got to try everything from appetizers, main course and the dessert. I have to say, none of apps or mains were great at all. We had ordered a Tagliere Misto (cured meats), carpaccio, a pizza, and rigatoni bolognese. The portions were small, the taste was average at best, and it was expensive. You can definitely get every item better somewhere else easily at multiple different locations. To be fair, I am comparing the cured meats to Richmond station, and that blows this one out of the water. The best dish was actually the dessert, but who goes to an Italian restaurant for dessert? Both the Budino Bar and Panino al Gelato were solid desserts, if anything save your app order and get ones of these."}
{"text":"It is a nice place to go, but the food doesn't taste  authentic italian. The menu doesn't have many selection. I like the upstairs patio is very nice. The server was very attentive. I find the restaurant is very noisy. It is good for tolerable inexpensive house wine by the glass."}
{"text":"Excellent everything! We ordered the beef tartare, lasagna and the Polpette pizza and it was ALL excellent! Staff was friendly... And good looking haha! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If you like mushrooms, get the fettuccine ai funghi and bruschetta funghi. Seriously. So. Good. I've never put anything more delectable in my mouth before.  $1/ounce wine, totally worth.  Great service, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Beautiful resto and reliably delicious food. Got the pizza with spinach and cheese, a yummy espresso with a biscotti, and great wine. Would return any day! Love the ambiance, quite close to other parties but never too loud thanks to a high ceiling. I can't wait for the weather to warm up."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed this place. The restaurant has an excellent ambiance, and it's great for a date night. Service was excellent and the food was fantastic."}
{"text":"There was a spider in my wine which unfortunately curbed my appetite completely. They didn't really acknowledge the situation at all but commented with \"oh how did that little guy get in there\" and rushed away. These things happen sometimes which is fair, but the way it was handled was poor. Was not offered anything to compensate for this which was extremely disappointing. Poor customer service in their end which is a shame as I usual rave about this resteraunt and would have continued doing so if it was handled differently. However, now everyone will hear about my spider experience."}
{"text":"Love their pastas (& burger too!) great service and can never go wrong with $1 per 1oz wine ;)"}
{"text":"The mushroom pasta is a must try ! The pizza was also delicious with the meatballs on top. The service was okay, however It was really busy which is why it was a longer wait time for food than normal. Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"Pretty typical of most restaurants in this area...crappy service, average food, trendy room, but nothing special...very forgettable."}
{"text":"We started with the octopus and the carpeccio    The octopus was delicious.  We sent the carpeccio back because it was quite dry.  I had the mushroom pasta as a main . I actually don't like mushrooms but the pasta was quite tasty ."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place from pictures on IG. Their mafalde ai funghi looks so amazing and when I finally got to try it - it did not disappoint! Will definitely come back, I need more!"}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times and have never been disappointed. Expect it to be busy since this is one of the more popular restaurants in Toronto, and they only take reservations at specified times.   During brunch there's a good selection of brunch options, and I'm always glad their famous mushroom truffle pasta is available during day time as well. In the evenings, there's $1/oz of house wine and more delicious and healthy Italian dishes.   The price is reasonable and this place consistently impresses me each time."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Gusto 101, my friends and I (party of 5) waited over 2.5 hours for a table despite being told initially that the wait would be 1 hour when we arrived at 5:30pm on a Saturday. We checked back with the staff a few times after the 1 hour mark, but they kept saying we'd be seated \"soon\". After 2 hours of waiting, we were pretty upset and voiced our frustrations. The manager was understanding and helped mitigate the situation by giving us a complimentary bottle of Prosecco while we waited. We were finally seated at 8:15 pm.   In terms of the food, the Malfade ai Funghi is delicious. Their beef carpaccio is also amazing as a starter. If I was judging by food alone, they'd definitely get 5 stars.   I've returned since the first visit, despite the horrendous wait time, only because their Malfade ai Funghi is sooo good. I made reservations for my subsequent visits to Gusto 101, which has definitely improved my experience, though they only take reservations at very select times. Also, I still find the service to be a little cold and insincere.   TL;DR: food is great but don't come here without a reservation, or you could end up waiting over 2.5 hours for a table."}
{"text":"Very delicious.  Great service and relaxed atmosphere.    Dinner on a Sunday night was packed. But service was quick.    The fish dishes are amazing.  The kale salad was amongst the best I had.   Amazing olive oil that they sell.    My date claims the tiramisu was the best she ever had.  The espresso in the desert was very good.  I look forward to visiting for just coffee"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, staff are so nice, and atmosphere is super cool. They had a roasted cauliflower at the time, and it was really good, the pizzas are also fantastic. Fair warming: it gets busy, so expect a wait if you don't get there early."}
{"text":"Food quality was good, beer selection interesting. Sat upstairs and had a quick meal prior to heading out to the Tarragon so didn't get to \"take in\" the local. But would recommend to anyone who likes good quality italian food in an inviting and stylish setting. We will most likely be back!"}
{"text":"Flitted into Gusto101 last night on account of Lee being closed til the 14th. We were with friends (hungry ones!) that don't get into the city all that often, so I was really hoping that our impulse trip into Gusto would be spectacular.  It wasn't perfect, but it was darn near close. Three of us got the Mushroom Linguine, however we ordered it Gluten-Free and so it was not linguine but Fusilli, which was surprisingly good given the absence of wheat. There were a -lot- of mushrooms, which was amazing in my eyes (given my love of mushrooms) but not so great for my friend, who was a tad overwhelmed.  To their credit, they told us about the mushroom abundance - and also explicitly told us that the sauce was quite heavy. The kitchen was very accommodating, however, in thinning out the sauce with some olive oil at our request.   The wine was good (and at $1 an ounce, who can say no?) and the Gelatto dessert was fantastic.   Prices were reasonable - I'll definitely be back to Gusto101  Also - big shout out to our server Amadeus. Cool dude, and really took care of us. 5/5 for that fellow"}
{"text":"I loved the setting and layout of the restaurant! It's located in the heart of downtown.  It was a sunny afternoon and we were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday. If you'd like to sit outside on the patio, I recommend making reservations and bringing sunglasses!   Our waitress was kind and helpful when it came to asking for a dessert and candle for my boyfriend (not complimentary - you do have to pay for it). It was a success and he was definitely surprised! However, the service was quite slow for brunch and perhaps that was due to the busy hour. I wasn't too bothered by it, as were some people.  I ordered a Berry bowl because I was feeling 'fruity', however I wasn't too happy with the overall taste of it. It was more on the sour side and I prefer sweet - plus the yogurt was actual warm rather than cold. I've never had warm yogurt served as part of a berry bowl. Don't get me wrong, I still ate it but it wasn't the best. Probably WOULDN'T recommend that order. Although, my boyfriend ordered the Gusto burger and he found it to be flavourful and well cooked, so based on how happy he was with his meal I'd recommend it too!  Lastly, I had to top off our brunch date with a Sangria and I have no complaints about it. Tasted just perfect.   Overall I'd say Gusto 101 is a nice spot to catch up with friends or have a one on one date. Bound to have a good time here!"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy. I got one a pasta (I forget what it's called) but so delicious. Also, I went with my girlfriends on a Friday night and it's $10 for wine (I think 5oz). Definitely will go abck."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!   The atmosphere of this place is really interesting. Definitely check out the upper floor, it's what makes this place.   The food is amazing! The mushroom pasta is honestly the best pasta I've ever heard. The grilled octopus is a dish that you have to try - not chewy at all. You can see all the delicate sauces and micro herbs they put on the dish to compliment it. Yum.   The wine is also very good.   I liked how they put you on a waiting list and text you when your table's ready. Very professional and time efficient. I don't have to sit in the restaurant and wait.   Overall, it was a positive experience."}
{"text":"The Food and The Drinks: At first, I decided to order the mushroom pasta, but after my friend told me that the mushroom flavour is extremely strong and the sauce a bit heavy, I decided against it, because if even she, a mushroom lover, thought it was overpowering, then I wasn't going to take my chances. After looking at the menu again, I decided to listen to my other friend and settled on the Hamburger al Gusto. Apparently, it's their specialty and boy am I glad that I listened to him. Whenever I go for a burger now, this will be the burger that all other burgers will be compared to. However, the fries that accompanied the burger was only ok. My mushroom-loving-friend ordered the mushroom pizza and really enjoyed that. The Peroni was quite good and a pretty good deal at $6 for 335ml. Like a lot of others have mentioned, the house white wine is also very good and was only $1 per ounce.  The Place: We sat on the patio and it was really nice. Yes, it's a bit cramped, but we navigated around just perfectly. The staircase was very dark though and could do with a bit more lighting. It was a bit scary going up and down then stairs. One thing to note: the bathrooms are unisex so don't be surprised if you find a member of the opposite sex opening the door to a bathroom stall or washing their hands next to you.  The service: The service was pretty good. Nothing to rave or complain about.  The Verdict: This was a great restaurant to chill with friends. It was a bit noisy, but not overwhelmingly so. It's not the cheapest place for a burger so I'm not going to be going there all the time, but when I'm craving that hamburger again, I'd definitely be making a beeline to Gusto 101."}
{"text":"Nice ambience and delicious food. A bit pricy. They even have private rooms for bigger group events."}
{"text":"Came here after reading all the rave reviews about this place. My friends got there around 6:00pm and got a table right away. I arrived around 7:15pm and there was a line all the way out to the sidewalk.   The place itself is very loud and we were right next to the open concept kitchen, so we were very hot. I was having dinner with people I haven't seen years, so it was hard to catch up with them over all the loud chatter going on.   Onto the food. I ordered their half chicken with sautéed greens. It was good, but not $22 good. The sautéed greens were really good with the perfect amount of garlic and seasoning. The cipolline onions were a little sour for my liking. The chicken was also served with a bit of chili that tasted like sweet potato puree and a red wine demi. I was only half done my chicken by the time I ran out of sauce. The portions were small and I left feeling hungry.   Drinks are on the pricier side, but they do offer their house wine at $1 per ounce, which is a neat feature. Order as much or as little as you like."}
{"text":"Do you want to feel like a number or like a person?   I felted like the staff in Gusto is felling too comfortable with their status, reputation, and amount of people visiting them, that they could be loosen up in excellence, service, and food tastiness.  The installations are great: two levels of an eclectic decoration that could easily be found in a Brooklyn trendy spot: two floors of open spaces in where you can appreciate who is where, doing what, but not hearing a thing of the things the important person in front of you is saying... Although, the ceiling made of windows must be astonishingly memorable on a full moon night if you go there for a private party or a rainy day.   For moments I felted like pecked at the food would be more appropriated that using the cutlery. The clucks, laughs, screams, claps, the 2nd handed information from the tables beside, being able to hear the breath of the people beside, conjugated with the feeling of my vocal cords being stressing too hard, gave me the trip of being part of a hen house.  We arrived there around 6 pm on a Thursday, the first floor was packed, but the Hostess told us we could fit on the 2nd floor. At the 2nd floor they asked us for reservation, they checked us out, and after asking to another person if they were busy, they gave us a mini table in the wooden bench with the Goodyear sign on the top (by the way, by the time we left, they didn't fill all the tables, so I guess they just wanted us to feel lucky enough to get a sit in there...)  When the first guy sat us he saw that when I posed my hand on the table it started moving like crazy, so he gently recommended us not to touch the table (even when he served us water he kind of had the same problem)... I let that go cuz I hopped someone was going to be smart/gentle/considerate enough to put something under the unbalanced table and fix something that could drop things from their guests: NO, they didn't. After we ordered the amazing 1/2 litter of \"Pecorino, Villa Angela, Velenosi, '12 Marche\", a new waiter noticed the problem on our table and said he would fix it immediately... but again they did NoThInG. The wine was excellent tho, I recommend it 100% because it was like if an Alvarinho and a Vinho Verde would've had a great kid.  The waitress was a sparkling character with nice energy, big shinny eyes decorated with long eyelashes, and a want to be efficient/trendy/modern iPad in hand. She asked us if we wanted bread, which she dropped by after in a paper bag like a messenger pigeon would do.  I wasn't impress by their food menu either. I think they spent more time or resources wine wise.   As an appetizer we ordered the Grilled Octopus. It was escorted by lots of spots of pastes: like kalamata olives, pesto/chimichurri, grilled/smoked red peppers, and lime, on top of some mashed boiled potatoes, with some arugula leafs as well. The tentacles were al dente; the grilled flavor was wonderful when accompanied by a sip of the wine and a bite of the bread passed by all the sauces.  Due to some reviews I read that made me push my husby to go here, I almost asked for the so praised mushroom fettuccine, but after lots of mental disagreements I opted to make my own opinion of any other item, so I ordered the Salmon alla Griglia. When asked which term would I like it to be, I said a medium rare please... However, ohhhh no more please, when I cut it I realized it was almost well done... Arggg.... I don't send back food, but still... If they have iPads how could they have mistaken a term? My husband in font was making signs trying to know the reason why I was making not satisfied faces, so when I kind of signal back to explain why, he was a sweet heart (like sometimes guys are just to avoid trouble) and suggested me to interchange plates.  I ate the 3rd last tiny piece of what they said was a lamb rack specially cooked for Thursdays,  but nah, not enough marination, pieces, or tenderness for me to recommend it. Even my husband who told me not to complain about my over cooked fish recognized that the taste of my dish was better than his. He adored the quinoa side. He wasn't even upset when I told the waitress (who finally came to see how everything was) that my fish was way over cooked. She asked to see it, and after recognizing they messed it up, she offered us deserts on the house.  After the general bitter taste, we didn't feel like been there anymore trying to enjoy some free sugar, so we refused the apologetic deserts, and at the moment of paying... Wow, they didn't charge for the Salmon: good touch, but not enough for me to go back, or for tell something good about the treatment."}
{"text":"Came here on a walk-by on a long weekend brunch Monday.  My brunch companion had been to Gusto 101 for dinner, and thought it was worth checking out their brunch.   We were led to sit upstairs on a trendy enclosed patio, brought water, and handed two simple clipboard menus. We didn't need long, as two menu items jumped out at us- ricotta pancakes and the cornetto (basically a croissant filled with pastry cream).  The coffees were strong, and delicious, but for those who are new to coffee, maybe not the easiest to drink.  Ricotta pancakes were fluffy and light, but a little secretly savoury- among the best pancakes I've eaten- EVER. As delicious as the ricotta pancakes were, the cornetto was somehow better. Served with a tiny parfait shot (layered granola, yogurt and fruit in a shot glass), the cornetto was a touch sweet, crisp and fluffy: the perfect croissant filled with an amazing cream.   The service was quick and attentive, but not intrusive.  The bill came to pennies over $25 for the two of us. I'd definitely recommend Gusto 101 for bunch.  Great food, good service and ambiance. A little trendier than I'm use to in the financial district, but a great find."}
{"text":"Wait time:  I arrived just before 8pm on a Friday night and the wait time was 1 hour. The wait time here is usually long so I was not surprised. We headed upstairs to the bar to grab a drink while we waited to be seated.   Food:  We usually order the grilled octopus to start but today we decided to try something different and we ordered the arancini instead. This dish comes with 2 rice balls so we ordered an additional one since there were 3 of us. The arancini were bite-sized but packed with flavour. Next time I will stick with the octopus - much tastier in my opinion.   For the main, I ordered the Mafalde ai Funghi. Admittedly, I only ever order this dish and for a really good reason...IT'S AMAZING!!! This is my all time favourite pasta dish, even after visiting Italy. The pasta was cooked to perfection and the truffle cream sauce was rich. Highly recommended for pasta lovers and first time visitors.   My boyfriend ordered the Bucatini al Ragu (he usually orders the Mafalde ai Funghi but wanted some protein today). Although the pasta was al dente, the dish was bland, lacked flavour and the veal was dry. He was disappointed because we love this restaurant and had high expectations. I was disappointed because I had to share my mushroom pasta :(   Service:  Our food came quickly and our interaction with the waitress was minimal. Can't complain since I was busy with enjoying my pasta :)  Final thoughts: Highly recommended for those who love Italian food. Service is efficient (once you get seated) and prices are very reasonable. I can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I, when travelling, mostly just eat and drink, and Yelp helped us find this immense gem of a place. We came on a Saturday evening, and were told that we'd have to wait to get into the restaurant, or we could sit in the upstairs patio area, so we said sure, upstairs will be okay! What a treat! A really cool space with a huge retractable skylight (closed when we were there, was around 15 degrees) and lots of windows, and cool old garage decor around (it's in a converted garage). It got even better as the sun set around us and the low ambient lighting fired up and the memorabilia along the walls was backlit. Really great ambiance, guys. The service was good, and friendly! They were attentive and gave us good recommendations.  I had the Hamburger al Gusto which was really good, with a rich flavour and was a nice twist on the traditional burger, and came with tuscan fries, which, if you're not getting something off the grill, I'd recommend as an appetizer because they were delicious. My girlfriend had the bolognese pasta, which was just a really high quality, tasty bolognese. Would recommend either entree.   Where we really handed Gusto 101 our money was on the drinks, which aren't cheap but are tasty. I had one of their seasonal beers (can't remember exactly which, but I do remember being impressed at their selection) and we both had several of the mojito 101 and the old fashioned 101 drinks. Both were good twists on the original; one would not think tequila and old fashioned would pair well, but they do!  Altogether we were really happy with our experience and would recommend it."}
{"text":"I've tried trattoria nervosa, which I believe is their sister restaurant and absolutely loved their Malfade Funghi (mushroom pasta). I decided to go for their pizza and was underwhelmed with the margherita pizza. Our table was able to free bread, but from my understanding they have no stopped offering free bread and you'll have to pay for it if you want it. They've got a great upstairs space. I would definitely come here and share a couple of dishes if you're feeling some hearty Italian food."}
{"text":"Go here. I've only had appetizers and drinks, but they were exquisite. Try the mozzarella di bufala and the Frank \"the prime minister\" Costello bourbon bitters drink"}
{"text":"I've been to Gusto 101 for brunch, lunch, dinner, drinks and patio chilling. It's great for all occasions and definitely one of my top preferences on this King St W/Portland corner (the other one being WVRST).  Things to like: - nice, professional and attentive service with good knowledge of the menu - a variety of spaces including an enclosed (but very bright) upstairs patio, street level patio, bar space and and multi-level tables next to an open kitchen - the wood interior  - $1 per ounce wine and the overall wine selection - kale salad - mushroom truffle fettuccine - the truffle aioli they have for their fries (I like truffles, okay?!) - occasional spotting of high profile Torontonians and Suits actors - a nice vibe whether full or empty, downstairs is especially cozy  Note: it can be pretty busy on weekends and evenings (particularly in warmer weather) with a line situation going on. The downstairs party near the kitchen can be kind of loud and claustrophobic when it's busy because the tables are pretty close together. Upstairs is much more spacious."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a lovely patio and is very nicely done up. I also like that they take reservations, unlike many restaurants in Toronto.   I came in with high expectations for the food, having read all the great reviews of this place, including on Yelp. However, the food was average, or at best slightly above average. I ordered the Mafalde ai Funghi and it was a little chewy and a bit dry (it seemed as though the pasta had been plated and then left out for a bit before it was brought to the table, which is why it seemed a bit dry). I also ordered the Polipo and frankly, the octopus was a tad bit rubbery rather than tender.  The food was by no means bad, but I did not truly enjoy it, and I was by no means impressed with it. It is unlikely that I will visit this place again; there are plenty of brilliant restaurants in Toronto that I would rather frequent."}
{"text":"Delicious food that is worth the wait  Went to Gusto last night with family around 9 pm, and at the time the wait was an hour. We decided to stay and wait in the front area. The hostess was super nice and accommodating to the fact that my sister was pregnant, so she made sure we weren't going to be at a high top table and gave us the option of eating upstairs (since it's two flights to go up) and the main floor.  We opted for the upstairs which was nice, if a bit cold, regardless of the heaters that they have. I would say that they could do with some curtains to cut down on the cold, and cut out some of the light from the glaring signs around.  As for the food, both my bro-in-law and I shared the Bruschetta Guanciale e Taleggio to start. I found the ratios a bit off, a bit too much spinach, so it overpowered the cheese and the thin slice of Guanciale on top. But it was minor, the dish was still enjoyable. We both then opted to get the same dish: Spaghetti al Nero di Seppi, which is squid ink spaghetti with seafood. At first I found the noodles too al dente for me, but as I continued to eat I appreciated the texture against the tenderness of the seafood. My sister got the Fettucine ai Funghi, which she adored. I tried a bite and it was delicious, very creamy with more well done noodles, but not too much as to be overpowering. She also got Insalata a Gusto, which she also pronounced to be quite good, (and her pregnant lady senses are exceptionally picky) .  Service was very friendly, and the server came around a couple of times to check on us, and very prompt with drinks and the bill.  The food was quite well priced, with everything plus a beer it came up to $100 for 3 people. Which I find quite reasonable.  I'd definitely go there again. (And if the wait is too much for you, they do accept reservations for their 6pm dinner seating)"}
{"text":"I waited for 45 minutes for a table of two. It also took long time to get my pizza which most of it was burned. I have no idea why this restaurant is so popular!!!"}
{"text":"A group of 6 of us was lucky enough to get the inside track on a prime table the other night, a Thursday, on the rooftop patio overlooking Portland street and the outside patio below. Matteo Floris hosted us along with the fabulous service of a couple of well trained and friendly wait staff. We simply asked that Matteo bring us food and pair the wine and we would tell him when we had had enough. Well we had our fill but personally I haven't had enough of Gusto - I'll be back - top notch. The wines are especially great and everything we had from the octopus to pizzas to the fish and beef, salads to the bread served in bags and then of course the olive oil... I'm a big fan!"}
{"text":"Tasty casual Italian, great for both dinner and brunch.  Mafalde as funghi is a must!"}
{"text":"It's a little overpriced for the amount of food you get, but it's great Italian food. I recommend the Ravioli Ricotta e Spinaci and Mafalde ai Funghi."}
{"text":"Really cool spot. Young, good looking crowd. Really lively and on the loud side. Atmosphere 5/5. Really nice decor. Like a redone garage kind of. We only came for drinks so we didn't really get to try the food but it looked great. Really massive wine list. House wine on tap for a buck an ounce. Went here in winter but this place is prob way better in the summer with the big garage style door."}
{"text":"I have been to Gusto 101 a few times but this visit was quite disappointing. This was my first time visiting for brunch, and I was in a group of 7. Upon arrival, we were told it was going to be an hour wait, even though there were some tables that were visibly available (but weren't a large enough table, would require pushing some together). After some deliberation, they agreed to accommodate and seat us.  I wasn't bothered by this, but unfortunately the visit got worse. I ordered the eggs benedict (labeled something else on menu), and one of the poached eggs was completely over cooked so the egg wasn't even slightly runny. I didn't make a comment because the staff were not super welcoming and I felt uncomfortable. Yes, the onus is on me as a customer to speak up, but we noticed the hosts gossiping about us (presumably about how difficult we were).  Next, when we received the bills, there was an 18% gratuity added. This isn't a problem, but one of my friends who is a server pointed out that we should have been told of this prior to ordering, on the menu, or at the very least when we received the bill. Otherwise, I would have mindlessly tipped on top of this. Our waiter overheard and clarified there was a gratuity added.  Overall, I felt because the gratuity was added that the staff did not feel they should provide us with any service and just do the bare minimum. In addition, a restaurant not being able to properly poach eggs OR serving them even though they were overcooked is not a good sign of quality. I am quite disappointed and will not visit again."}
{"text":"First of all, this has to be known - Gusto 101 has some pretty wonderful staff. I contacted the restaurant during the week prior to our visit and was basically that indecisive customer calling several times a minute, switching the number of people for my reservation. But despite my nagging requests, the staff here were so polite, friendly, and professional, accommodating each request with ease. I'm so impressed. As well, Nick was our server during our actual meal, and he was super attentive, professional, and pretty fantastic.  First, the parking situation. We came on a pretty cold, frigid Sunday evening and parked at the lot right beside Jimmy's Coffee (which is right beside Gusto 101). It cost $10.00 to park there for a few hours on a weekend evening. I believe there's also some street parking available one block north of the restaurant.   Second, the food and atmosphere. The menu was pretty extensive, and the restaurant was trendy with some rustic appeal. The restaurant itself was quick and operated like a well-oiled machine, and the ambiance felt both unique and contemporary at the same time. We ordered: a glass of wine, the Tuscan Fries as an app ($7.00), the Kale Salad ($14.00), and the Tuna Pasta ($17.00). I really liked the aioli that came with the fries - great dipping sauce, and the fries were nice and crispy. The Kale Salad was the star - nutty, sweet, and tarte at the same time. However, I wasn't a fan of the pasta at all - tuna in tomato sauce doesn't do it or me, I guess. We also had bites of our friends' orders - while the pizzas tasted fine, the mushroom pasta was delicious.  Overall, a good experience because of the staff and environment - while the food was on and off for us, everything else made up for it. It's a great spot for bigger groups and families too. Note: If you're a larger group, request a table upstairs - it's bigger, brighter, and way more spacious.   For two people, with tax, tip, group gratuity, and a 'plating fee' if you bring a birthday cake to eat after your meal ($3.00 per person), our total was around $78.00."}
{"text":"Went here a couple weeks ago to celebrate an anniversary with my boyfriend. We reserved a table on the patio rooftop which had a really nice atmosphere. The windows were open for a little while before it started getting kind of breezy.   Our server was pretty attentive and friendly; made sure dishes were cleared off our table quickly and water glasses were filled.    For appetizers we ordered the Bruschette Invernale ($12) and the Polipo ($16). The bruchetta was pretty good but paled in comparison to how tender and amazing the grilled octopus was. Presentation was fantastic and I still have dreams about that dish.   For mains I got the Mafalde ai Funghi ($17.50) and my boyfriend got the Pizze Diavola ($17.50). The mafalde was basically the best mushroom pasta I've ever had. The taste wasn't overpowering and the portion was big enough for leftovers. The pizza was way bigger than expected and according to my boyfriend, really good and has just enough spice to give it a kick but not overpower the rest.   They have a decent selection of drinks, but I opted for the $1/oz. house wine (pinot grigio).  Slightly pricier than my usual student restaurants but totally worth the food experience. Ugh I want that octopus now."}
{"text":"I WOULD GO TO THIS RESTAURANT JUST TO HAVE THE KALE SALAD!!!!!!!! Pasta is good, but kale salad is amazing! Have tried to do it in my apartment but seems imposible hahaha.  Had the avocado toast too which was okay"}
{"text":"Gusto 101 has a truly unique atmosphere as it is built in an old automobile shop. My friend and I went there on a Wednesday night. The first thing I remember is how crammed the tables were, you could pretty much hear everything your neighbor was saying. We started off with the charity bread. It came in a paper bag that contained 6 cut pieces of Sourdough. I remember thinking that the bags look like the vomit bags in airplane, very bad choice. I ordered a mojito and my friend got a coke. The mojito was good but a bit on the strong side.  I ordered a margarita pizza and it das DIVINE. The sauce, the crust, the mozzarella blended so well together. My friend got the Prosciutto pizza without cheese which he described as \" perfect \".  All in all the experience was great and the service was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Came here for second time last night with a friend--phenomenal ambiance and service.  We initially sat at bar. Our bartender, Jordan was awesome and attentive, which set the tone for dinner.... I ordered the insanely delicious mafalde ai funghi with gluten-free pasta sub (portobello, porcini, oyster mushrooms, truffle cream sauce).   Highly recco this place, just tucked around the corner from King Street West chaos."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time here and the place didnt disappoint. I ordered the kale salad with chicken ($22) and as per other yelpers, fully enjoyed the healthy goodness. Good portions and the atmosphere was lively.   Sister got the pizza on the brunch menu (item I had my first time there). Pizza was great, thin crusted and food portion for one person  Only fallback is that the place was a bit tight, had to maneuver my way around the table booth..not my ideal situation"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the city, great environment very sassy, perfect servers, I absolutely love this spot! I give this place 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Came back here last night because I wasn't willing to wait an hour for a table at Home of the Brave.  The line was long, but seating in the 'skylight room' required no waiting time. My pal and I were in high chairs sitting beside each other, but we didn't mind this set up. I actually like the second floor more!   Since it was my pal's first time, she had to order the wine on tap. And for a dollar an ounce, the price was right. I ordered the Spinacci pizza and it was delicious. It was heavy with loads of spinach. The roasted garlic a gave a punch to the taste. Two kinds of cheese was great too.  I really like Gusto - the food, the ambiance, the clientele. Can't wait to go back again.  Good for: drinks, girls night out, dates"}
{"text":"Great social place to eat. Love the environment and atmosphere. You must try the mafalde ai funghi pasta. It is the best pasta I've ever tried. I love the touch of truffle cream sauce and the cheese. I come back all the time to have that particular pasta. The kale salad and carpaccio were great appetizers as well. I also love the pistachio ice cream sandwich for dessert. I would recommend reserving online. Please note, the only take reservations for 6pm. Anything after will be first come first serve basis. It often is extremely packed especially on weekends and Friday's the estimated wait time can be one hour or more. If you book for more than 8 people you will be forced to choose the nonna style menu which is a set price menu. Not bad for selection as you get to try a bit of each. I just don't like how you can't substitute or anything. Also summer time I would recommend sitting downstairs as the patio upstairs gets extremely hot and there is no air condition."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Went with a colleague and sat at the bar upstairs on the partially covered roof deck. Great scene. Vibrant and fun. The octopus was prepared perfectly and they were serving Bucatini All'Amatriciana - my personal favorite, which took me back to my time in Rome. Ian, the bartender upstairs, was on point with the Negronis, the food, and the conversation.  Drawback - this is not a bar for beer drinkers unless you love Peroni, but the mixed drinks, food, and laid back scene made up for it.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"My cousin and I came here on a Wednesday afternoon for lunch. I loved this place and would definitely return! Very nice vibrant patio. We ordered the a pitcher of the white wine sangria which was pretty good. We also ordered the kale salad, grilled octopus, mushroom truffle pasta, and the shrimp pasta. My favourite was definitely the octopus. 10/10 would recommend and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"great place to grab dinner!   I always order the fettuccini de funghi. Great portions. the pasta is always al dente and filled with several different types of mushrooms. You can add chicken, which is grilled and not dry. This is a must order!  The flat bread pizza is also a good option. Ordered the sausage pizza and it was a bit soggy in the middle. Sausage pieces are so big that they may fall off as you're eating a slice (LOL).   Love the patio and the upstairs features a glass roof."}
{"text":"Mafalde ai Funghi - all time favourite dish. The combination of the truffle, fresh pasta, mushrooms are soooo delicious.   Overall, the food is consistently good. The salads are fresh and unique, a little on the expensive side considering the pasta is only a few dollar more. Pizza is tasty. Service is good, environment is trendy and lively."}
{"text":"We were a table of 4.  When we got there, they said that it would be an hour wait for a table.  They did have availability at the skylight bar tables.  Which was ok for us.  The upstairs did have a pretty good vibe/atmosphere.  It's not quiet so if you are looking for that, I would not recommend this place.  Our waitress was super nice.  However, upon finishing our meals, we did wait a bit until we could find her again to get our bill.  Food wise, the octopus and scallop dishes were amazing.  Arancini appetizer was ok but then again, I recently visited Italy and had the most amazing Arancini there.  Plus you only get two balls that were a bit small in size.  I would reorder the octopus but perhaps not the Arancini.  The Seafood pasta with the Squid ink pasta was good.  The pasta itself is quite tasty!  Oh and yes, the $1 per ounce wine is a great feature and it's not bad table wine.  The best is the bathrooms!  Communal washing station.  3 stalls for the ladies and only 1 for the men.  Quite funny to see 3 guys waiting to use the bathroom with 2 women stalls empty.  The building itself is pretty cool.  I would recommend sitting upstairs as the roof top is pretty neat."}
{"text":"This place has it all; great food, great atmosphere and staff. The aged steak was on point. The attention to detail was amazing. Very comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here at 6pm with a reservation on a Saturday evening. We came here for our anniversary dinner because the first time, the food was so good. I'd say this second time around, the experience wasn't as great.   The food was fine, we got the pumpkin ravioli and the meatball pizza. Like the first time, the crust is thin and crunchy and great to dip in olive oil. The meatball was soft but bouncy, and tasted like a sausage. The pizza was good, though I still prefer the Margarita pizza.  The pasta comes in about 9 ravioli pieces, covered in delicious roasty brown butter sauce and toasted pumpkin seeds and pine nuts. Honestly, it tasted like warm shortbread Christmas butter cookies, yum! The pasta was rolled thin, had some chew to it, and had small cubes of pumpkin around the dish.  The only downside to this place is that it's so loud that we had to yell at each other the whole time. I wouldn't recommend this place if you're on a first date, or if you want to have a nice conversation with a friend. I recommend coming early if you want to hear each other. The place starts to get really packed around 7-8pm.  Also, the service lacked presence. Maybe because it was a busy night, but the server was always away attending other tables. We had to wait a while each time we wanted something; to get extra olive oil, to get the bill, to get the credit card machine. They didn't even have time to ask how was our food.  Good food but pick an off-peak time to go!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this restaurant for a longgggg time now. So finally we go on our date night and I made sure to have a reservation just in case. But we got there a bit earlier and the host was able to seat us no problem. But the restaurant was already quite full. Quite crowded but nice atomesphere. We got water promptly. They offer a pretty big variety to their menu and their drink menu was big. We started off with arancini. They have great bread to start us off. The arancini arrived and have to say we were really disappointed with this dish. There was only 2 pieces. 10 dollars. 2 pieces. We barely had a chance to fully enjoy it because....Well it was gone fast. So we won't be ordering that again. We ordered veal pasta with saffron sauce and a meatball pizza. They were delicious and did not disappoint. Overall, I really enjoyed this restaurant but will skip the arancini for sure. The pizza and the pasta was so good. Service was prompt and food came out in reasonable time. Prices are average with other Italian pizza restaurants. Will be back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Wow. Everyone's commenting on the mushroom pasta. I suppose I'll throw my two cents in as well.  Mine was mafalde ai funghi ($17.50) - Mafalde is almost like a lasagna noodle cut into long strips, except that the length of each piece of pasta is crimped the way a lasagna noodle is. It was my first time having this type of pasta, and its length made it a challenge to eat without a knife (takeout. I'm lazy). That being said, it had an interesting texture. More firm than I'm used to. Not a bad thing though. Like most of the others, I agree that that mushroom (funghi) and cream sauce was superb. Mushrooms were lovely and woodsy. Cream was nice and rich. The truffle smell is definitely there. If you like mushroomy cream sauce, this is the dish for you. The only downside is the pool of oil at the bottom of the plate once you're done. It's a bit of a turn off.  As a treat, it's good. If you're being health-conscious, this probably isn't the meal for you."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come to Gusto 101 for years now. My sister in law's birthday gave us a good excuse to go. We came at 4:45om on a Friday and were able to get a table for 5 of us without a reservation. The restaurant has an industrial feel and yet is cozy with an open concept kitchen to see  the chefs hard at work. The focaccia was soft and delicious (as per my hubby and his family) and my father in law literally couldn't stop eating it.   After reviewing the menu and eyeing the orders lined up to be delivered, we ordered the mushroom pasta, two orders of the shrimp pasta, the salmon, and the hazelnut chicken. We also ordered the Brussels sprouts. Oh the Brussels sprouts!!!! Those roasted Brussels sprouts were amazing! I had no idea what vinocotto was before I ate these sprouts but I'll be looking for it so I can recreate this dish of garlicky and syrupy thick cooked wine deliciousness. The broccolini with roasted hazelnuts was really good too. My in laws found the pasta a bit too al dente and rich but in fairness they prefer their pasta a little soft. I enjoyed my chicken. The butternut squash purée added a subtle sweetness which contrasted with the saltiness in the chicken and nuttiness of the farro and roasted hazelnuts. My hubby's salmon was perfectly cooked but I'm not sure how I felt about the slightly bitter broth that it was served with.   For dessert we ordered the trio which included tiramisu, a budino bar, and a half gelato chocolate cookie sandwich. I appreciated that the budino bar was not too sweet. The tiramisu was served in a mason jar and was the right balance of creamy, chocolatey, and bitter espresso goodness. The pistachio gelato with chocolate cookie was enjoyed very much by my father in law as well.   Overall we had a delicious meal. Had I not been avoiding gluten and dairy, I would definitely have wanted to try their pasta and pizza as these looked and smelled really good."}
{"text":"Dude said to try this out so I was like ok.  Atmosphere is similar to that of a bar, but a little classier. Def the date night vibe but casual and chic, very low pressure kind of deal.  They're known for their alcohol selection which I didn't look at, but literally 60% of their dinner menu was alcohol and lots of people were drinking.  They're known for their mafalde di fungi (dkm if I misspelled this) and it was splendid. Just this dish alone is 5*. Sauce was not overwhelming and pasta was not swimming in the sauce. Mushrooms were fresh and juicy. Super flavourful but not salty. Def recommend this thing. I was pretty skeptical with mushrooms and flat noodles being $20 but i can see why.  Dude got a burger and fries. American burger? He said it was mad juicy and I saw the burger was T H I C C. Greatest thing was that no matter how you held the burger, nothing fell out.  Tuscan fries were amazing. They came as a side for him and I loved everything. They were 500p salty but it wasn't like you're eating just salt. Those potatoes were some of the best fries ever. I think they seasoned the batch before serving.  Service was a 2* because they existed but they didn't give us a tea light :( also didn't really check in on us at all. Mafalde de whatever brought up the rating."}
{"text":"An interesting corporate drinks and dining experience.  We arrived, were told that a table would be about 45 minutes, or even longer if we wanted the rooftop patio (which we did). We said its fine and went to the bar and ordered a beer. Within 10 minutes of arrival we were told our table was ready. The person who took us there said this is always the case... Told that it would take a long time for a table but things were ready within a short period, so I'm not sure if they are trying to scare people away from waiting or what, but it still seems a bit odd.  That said, once making it upstairs and seated on the patio, you can't help but be impressed. A slightly garden type vibe, even the transition from the sunlight into the darkness of night kept a really enjoyable ambiance.  The food was great. The polipo (char grilled octopus) was the surprise of the night. I'm normally not a seafood fan in general but this stuff literally tasted like grilled chicken. The beef carpaccio was also good but admittedly was a bit delicate, in the sense you couldn't remove a whole piece from the plate without it ripping in half on the plate. For dinner I had the Strip Loin which was cooked to perfection and served with tasty crispy fingerling potatoes. Top marks and probably the best steak I've had for under $30 in a while.  Only missed marks come from the service (which wasn't bad, but certainly wasn't on point - things like leaving empty beer bottles on the table when bringing us new ones, and we waited a while after dessert before being able to get our bill brought to the table), and the lack of beer selection (they only have Peroni on draught, and you can only order it on the rooftop patio, while bottle selection on the main level is only a handful of options at most as well).  Also, awkward points for the co-ed washrooms. Watching people walk in, walk out, and walk back in after unsuccessfully finding a second bathroom is a bit comical."}
{"text":"The truffle pasta was amaze balls. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff was very friendly. If I come to Canada this is for sure a must spot!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  Great vibe and energy. Food is excellent. Staff are wonderful. Friendly and helpful.   Highly recommend the Polipo Anitpasti. So yummy.    Beer selection is poor. But the wine selection is excellent.  I would highly recommend this place to anybody and plan to come back here again."}
{"text":"we go to Gusto on a weekly basis, and normally blow past the line up to hit the bar upstairs - we're in an out, we know what we want, no need to wait.  Tonight we arrived for an early dinner, and the (new) host at the front with Waldo glasses stopped us: Host: May I help you Us: no, that's ok, just heading upstairs Host: for ? Us: food & drink, is that ok ? Host: let me check with the hostess upstairs Us: sure.. Host: sorry, there is no space upstairs, its full.  Feel free to sit at the bar inside  We decided to stroll upstairs anyway, only to discover an open patio, with about 35% of the seating occupied. We checked in with the hostess and she invited us to sit basically wherever we wanted.    $100 and an hour or so later, we were completely satisfied with the excellent and attentive service, the excellent menu and food received (actually, the pizza tonight was the best I've had, and I've had their pizza at least 20 times).  Needless to say, we were unimpressed with the host from the main entrance. Host Score: 0% Gusto Score: 100%"}
{"text":"Really great organic kale salad! & fungi pasta was amazing. Presentation wasnt great perhaps, looks rushed a bit but super busy dinner night when i went on a Thursday. Great for date nights or just chill on the patio :)"}
{"text":"Had dinner here FINALLY and still 4/5 stars! Modern and food-centric vibe suited for everyone - had the suited, dressy clientele, romantic couples, friend groups, families, etc.   Food- 4/5. Everyone raves about the Mafalde ai Funghi pasta and I got to try some last night. Very heavy and decadent - lots of cream and cheese and thick, chewy, heavy carb pasta... No wonder it tastes so good! I honestly feel that the taste of this dish can be reproduced in one's own kitchen as long as one uses a higher quality, thick pasta and add fatty ingredients liberally. I ordered the Cavolfiori (vegetarian), which is roasted cauliflower in a chickpea puree (hummus basically), field mushrooms, hazelnuts, pine nuts, pumpkin seeds, and harissa pomegranate. Yummy, beautifully presented, but small and definitely not as filling as its pasta/pizza counterpart entrees.   Value- 3/5. Standard for a 2 dollar sign downtown Italian restaurant, i.e. pasta and pizza mains are around $18 and entree platters between $20-40. However, there is no complimentary bread for the table and portions (except for the pizzas) are small. Great for the waistline, I guess. I was still hungry after dinner.   Service- 3.5/5. Very friendly and cheerful servers, but unfortunately with so many customers you will likely have to wait a little bit for anything.  Venue- 4/5. Beautiful sidewalk patio and upstairs covered patio. Inside on the 1st floor it's too dark and crowded, especially at peak meal times. The tables are all really close together and the place sure fills up. No dress code, but definitely saw a few suited gents and dressy ladies."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! Definitely worth the wait. Great food, cool interior and an awesome garage-chic vibe  - think Pirelli calendar meets hipster.    This is mos def going to be one of my go-to's.  I was very intrigued by the house wine @ $1 per ounce, but apparently it was more  popular than expected as I checked this spot out on day 6 and they had already sold out.  The regular wine list is a bit small if you only want to go by the glass, but decent.  They have a varied  menu with items that would please even the most finicky palate.  In fact I would almost say too much choice as I had a hard time narrowing down what I wanted to eat, lucky for me plates are perfect for sharing. Pizza was good, not as doughy as Libretto more of a cracker like crust, but still very tasty.  Pastas were amazing and cooked to perfection.   Servers are uber friendly and very helpful (and keep in mind this was only day 6, so I'm pretty impressed).   And boy is  that chef is easy on the eyes, too bad you can't take him to go.  ;)"}
{"text":"Very good pizza margherita and arugula salad. We also had the poached pears and the tiramisu. I wished the pears had been served warm  but the tiramisu was wonderful .  The restaurant had a cool vibe. We had a 30 min wait . Our waitress was very good and checked on us often."}
{"text":"Love their food, especially the kale salad, it6s a must try. Service is impeccable and food is amazing"}
{"text":"I finally came back here! This time we had the charcuterie app (forgot the name but man was it delicious!!!) And we had the diavola pizza and the mushroom pasta. Amazing stuff, guys. I love it here. A place to casually impress. It's loud - full of easy going patrons who are having a great time. The upstairs patio area is definitely the best place to sit but this place is pretty busy so you might have to wait for a seat up there. Oh and they have 1$ per oz wine so you know it's gonna be a good time at Gusto 101!"}
{"text":"My experience at Gusto was excellent. I love how unique the restaurant is - the fact that it was once an old garage gives it a certain charm that makes it stand out amongst the other King West restaurants.   I had the cavolo nero salad and mafalde ai funghi. The salad was light and refreshing and full of different flavours. Since I've never had mushroom pasta before, I expected my pasta to be a little bit on the earthy side because of the mushrooms. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was not the case. The truffle cream sauce was a good counterbalance against the earthiness of the mushrooms, making the mafalde ai funghi an absolute delight of a dish. I liked the presentation of the dish as well - I liked the rustic-ness of the mushrooms with the tentacle-shaped noodles topped with shaved parmigiana.   Gusto has definitely made it to my list of favourites to go to in Toronto. It has an energetic yet intimate ambiance, it is very aesthetically pleasing and the food is delicious - not too heavy but not light either making it possible to have room for drinks and dessert!"}
{"text":"Checking out this place is a must! Janet zuccarini has really out done herself on this one. Im sure most of you are familiar with her other restaurant, yorkville staple Trattoria Nervosa. Its been going strong for 15 years and I'm sure gusto will follow suit. Considering the kitchen staff come from some of the best restaurants in north america, as well as it having the most high tech kitchen in the country. The food here is simple yet elegant and still interesting while being consistent in quality. If you haven't made it there yet do it before it becomes too hard to get a table!"}
{"text":"Horrific service. The server was smug, gave us inaccurate information about reservations, and made the whole experience a complete waste of an evening. It's a trendy spot but I would avoid unless you like a heaping serving of attitude with your flavorless and overcooked pasta dinner."}
{"text":"Food is great but the ambience and the design of the resto is absolutely amazing. Its a converted parking garage transformed into an eclectic chic resto with a great rooftop patio. The cellar is great to rent out for a private event."}
{"text":"I just LOVE this restaurant! I've been here 3 times so far and have yet to be disappointed. My all time favourite is the steak tartare. Portions are very generous and they just nail it on the spices. The octopus is very, very good and the pizza is top-notch! How can this place get better? Oh maybe with their $1/ounce house wine! I'll be a regular here for sure."}
{"text":"Rebuilt from an old industrial auto garage, Gusto is not your typical eatery. They have been around the vibrant king west block for a few years now and still continues to be the one of the most coveted Italian restaurants in Toronto serving up bold Italian flavours and the most lively restaurant scene.   The one key thing about this place is how it could be difficult to get seating but the food is so worth it!! They are primarily a walk in restaurant but they do take reservations for lunch at 12-1pm and dinner at 6pm so get on those reservations! If not a typical wait would be around 40+mins.  They have two seating areas, in the downstairs main dinning area and on the rooftop patio. The rooftop patio is the more casual and bright with the main floor more cozy and intimate where you can see the open kitchen. Both are always buzzing with people and when it's busy (always) you will likely have to lean in to hear the person across from you.  Now on to the food!!   - Mafalde ai Funghi: everyone raves about this mushroom pasta and the rave is REAL. That sauce is so flavourful and rich with mushroom essence because of the truffle oil and all soaked in the mafalde pasta that is cooked perfectly al dente. We ordered seconds of this.  - Cavolo Nero aka Kale salad: it's usually hard for salads to steal the show but this one here really did. The kale is so fresh and bonus that it is organic. Sizeable portion and definitely recommend.  - Assorted cured meats: nice selection of cured meats with delicious pickles, mustard and crostini on the side. I like how the meats are a tad more mild tasting and less salty.   - Pizzas: all their pizzas are thin-crust wood oven pizza and there are quite a few options to choose from. My favourite is prosciutto and argula - can't go wrong with this combo.  - Vino!: Although they have an extensive wine list, I think their own house-brewed wine (red and white) is really good and only $1 per ounce! Very easy to overindulge :)  Food comes at a good pace and service is great. I came one time with my girlfriends and had an endless amount of food binging and drinking and desserts for hours and the final bill was surprisingly much less than expected. My current fav Italian spot!"}
{"text":"Came here for an early birthday dinner and had a wonderful time!   Food 4/5: We started with the Cavolo Nero, a lovely kale salad which was light and fresh. I really liked the vinaigrette. For my main I had the Mafalde ai Funghi which was delicious. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was creamy and rich. My friend ordered the Regina Margherita which had a crisp crust and the tomatoes were sweet and bursting with flavour. For dessert we ordered an espresso with biscotti, the Brioche con Gelato and tiramisu. The dessert wasn't my favourite. The tiramisu was dusted with what I think was coffee grinds but it was a bit like eating sand, the espresso was too strong and while the gelato was nice, the Brioche was basically a hamburger bun.  Atmosphere 5/5: I think my favorite thing about the night was their beautiful patio. Even though it was mid October it was still warm outside and they had plenty of heaters. They also have lights in the surrounding bushes. It was very cosy and romantic, great place for a date!   Service 4/5: The server was a bit slow to take our order but we weren't rushing so it was fine. The food came out quickly and we got everything we needed."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for drinks and lucked out that they had seating on the patio at 7pm on a Saturday. I ordered sangria and my friend had some cocktails. Drinks were good, nothing out of the world.   The staff seemed really eager to please and would interrupt every 10 mins, it was nice of them to check up on us at first but it just got more and more annoying. The food on the tables beside us looks absolutely amazing, I will definitely come back and give the food a try!"}
{"text":"One of my top 10 favourite restaurants! That says a lot coming from someone who tries new restaurants everytime....i keep coming back. Amazing food that just makes you talk about it ! The place is even better in the summer ! So cool!  Not a complaint but something to keep in mind...its very loud and full almost always so not the best place to have an intimate conversation but definetly a place for a good night. Been here 3x already and everytime blown away!"}
{"text":"Must Try - Mafalde ai Funghi (portobello, porcini, oyster mushrooms truffle cream sauce 17.50) ... that is all I have to say."}
{"text":"This restaurant gets a 5 star from me simply because of their \"Mafalde ai Funghi\".  It is delicious and I literally have cravings for it on a regular basis.  Aside from that, service is good / atmosphere is good - a go to choice for me for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Gusto is good. The house wine is tasty. We had the pizza and the steak. Both were delicious.  Solid place."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, attentive staff and the selection Of music was swanky.   I came here with a group of friend and tried the polpette pizza, carpaccio, grilled king oyster mushroom and seafood pasta. The Stars of the show were the mushroom & pasta for being perfectly cooked.  The two other dishes were just \"okay\" at a mediocre level."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place, but always passed by at times when I already had plans at another event or resto.  I like the décor of the grungy warehouse garage feel to this restaurant. I think this place was a garage at one point. The washroom was a bit confusing as there were no signs for male or female. I later figured it was one big washroom that both males and females used.  The service was good. The Romea cocktail I had was really delicious with Roman inspired flavors of citrus and herbs. I love when I make good food decisions because I was debating between the burger and the skinned salmon and I'm so glad I got the burger. It was moist with sweet caramelized onions, arugula and other amazing garnishes. The fries were made in house perfectly seasoned and salted. They were served in a copper dish, so it stayed warm and crispy by whole meal stay at Gusto 101, so it was the first time I didn't waste the fries due to them usually going cold and soggy.  4 stars only because I feel the food was overpriced."}
{"text":"House wine, $1 per ounce.   Food is solid--yes, try the mushroom pasta and the kale salad for your first visit, it's a must. That's what Gusto's famous for in this town. But I do encourage you to make your return and try the other pizza and pasta and seafood items. The branzino was top-notch: crispy on the outside, tenderly cooked, beautiful flavour.  If you're trying to have a conversation on the patio, request adjacent seating at the bar aka two seats that are at the corner of bar tables. Thank me later."}
{"text":"The dinner menu is five star. For starters we had the buffalo mozzarella and it was so incredibly delicious. Following that I had the bucatini and it was made perfect. The pasta sauce for the bucatini is so good you could slap an old lady. Finally, I ended my experience with the crostatina, which was such a unique dessert I still can't find words to describe how fabulous it was.   The reason I gave it a four star is because we went for brunch and the experience was quite different. I had the banana bread with honey mascarpone. It was less than average and served with once frozen strawberries... blah. I also had the avocado toast which was a lot spicier than expected. Overall the Avocado dish was underwhelming and somewhat boring.  It was also very hot inside, no fans or ac here. The bathrooms were quite messy as well. It was a \"communal\" kind of bathroom which was a bit awkward especially when you aren't expecting it. Next time we will definitely go back for the dinner menu, only!"}
{"text":"Funghi pasta is SO GOOD! It's one of the best pasta I had in Toronto. The only thing is, it's always busy and that's the reason I don't go there regularly. You always need to line up at least 20 minutes regardless. Lovely patio upstairs too."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of pasta and this very hipster place did not disappoint!  Been here a few times already and everytime I come here, I stick to their pasta.  My most recent visit was with a friend at around 6 on a weekday.  Very easy to find a spot as the restaurants were not fully filled yet so we were seated immediately.  Servers are amazing here as they are very friendly and attentive, they immediately greeted us and ask us if we wanted water.  After going through the menu, my friend and I decided to order the Mojito and the Gusto Sangria for our drinks, Mafalde ai Funghi and Rigatoni Bolognese for our main.  Drinks were amazing, but my friend and I both liked the Sangria better than the Mojito.  In terms of the pasta, I already knew it would be amazing from coming here a few times already.  I was really happy my friend loved her Mafalde ai Funghi, she loved and ate some of my Rigatoni Bolognese too.  The truffle cream sauce in the Mafalde ai Funghi and the meat sauce in the Bolognese were fantastic, pasta was done al-dente so it had great texture and chewy, which is a must for me.  I highly recommend vising this place if you are near the area and is craving for some great pasta!  Only thing i didn't like about this place is the doors are always opened, so they don't really have AC.  On a hot summer day, you may sweat a lot while eating."}
{"text":"While waiting for the bars to open and after a big dinner, we sat at the bar. The place was PACKED! We watched the cooks go nuts for 40 minutes - making all sorts of super tasty looking dishes. It was quite entertaining. We had a very attentive and friendly server. Had a kale salad - it was big and had a lemon dressing that was light in nature but put on very thickly (read: too much dressing)."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner Specialty: Lunch, Dinner (Brunch coming Mar.30.2012) Menu items: Tagliolini al Nero, Ravioli di Zucca and Desserts accompanied with wine on tap  The new addition to trendy King West in Toronto has finally come to enchant us with its rustic decor, wine on tap for $1/oz and superb Italian inspired dishes with a twist. It seems Italian cuisine is taking over King West with places such as Buca, Alimento, Tutti Matti and Scarpetta just minutes walking distance from each other. The good thing is that all of these restaurants have their own unique style and way of cooking; and Gusto 101 certainly does not stay behind offering a variety of pastas, pizzas, salads and Tuscan grilled-style dishes that just make my mouth water as I type.  Having a personal weakness for squid ink pasta for its fantastic taste and texture, my first obvious meal choice was the Tagliolini al Nero. Food made with squid ink is not a culinary delight. It's an addiction. The intense black color and strong rich taste makes you want to eat this pasta again and again until none is left. One fork full of this black goodness mixed with cuttle fish, oven roasted tomatoes, fresh peas and lemon zest adding some tanginess to it, and you know you've just reached culinary addiction.  There are two ways of making this pasta, one is from scratch and as part of the pasta dough, the other as part of the sauce. The former being the most complex and rewarding in terms of flavour...so glad Gusto got it right!  And speaking of flavour, if some of you have yet to venture into ravioli, I recommend you do it here. The twist that Gusto has added to its Italian inspired meals is definitely seen through the Ravioli di Zucca. Not sure how the chef came up with the idea of mixing roasted pumpkin, parmigiano cheese and sage brown butter, but I am glad he did! What an exquisite taste. The ravioli pasta is good, I mean we just settled on the fact that their pastas are fantastic, but in this case it's not so much the pasta as it is the goodness of the ingredients playing in one's mouth. Yes its buttery and rich, but the sweetness of the pumpkin just comes through so elegantly and discrete, it makes this a superb dish and a must try at Gusto.  Now on to my second favourite part of the meal (first was obviously my black pasta), Gusto's wine on tap for just $1/oz. I was extremely hesitant to try wine on tap, but was quickly convinced by the price. Depending on the day you go, Gusto offers different kinds on tap. That night we were offered a lovely Pinot Grigio and a Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon. Let's just say, I ended up getting 10oz of the Pinot Grigio. What a deal and a great pairing to my meal.   Finally on to desserts...Tiramisu and Chocolate Creme with salted caramel. The Tiramisu was nothing worth mentioning, it was very light and tasty but nothing that will blow your mind away. The Chocolate Creme on the other hand was a hit. The salted caramel balanced off the sweetness from the chocolate quite nicely. Our waiter told us to mix the dessert well as it was drizzled with some olive oil...say what? Oh yeah, the idea was to get all flavours working before your spoon went in, and so we did. Needless to say, that little glass cup was wiped clean by the time I was done.  Note to reader: My only complain about Gusto is that in an effort to sit as many people as possible in a small space, it has forgotten about their customers' comfort. Luckily for you, if you are seated by the wall/mirror, you wont be as bothered; on the other hand if you are seated in any of the centre tables running across the restaurant, and you are party of 4, you better pray the wait staff has been trained to maneuver around you. It's almost impossible for people to pass by. We were one of the unlucky ones and thankfully prior to the restaurant getting busy, we were accommodated in another table as my party kept getting their heads pumped by waiters and other customers passing by. This is something owner Janet Zuccarini should be aware of and address immediately before numerous free meals are given away due to these inconveniences.   Buen Provecho, Viviana."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Friday night for a causal date night. Originally the wait was going to be an hour (which we expected) but managed to get a seat right away due to a cancellation. Nearly impossible to get a seat outside on the patio or roof top unless you're willing to wait, so we seat inside which was still nice.   Server was very nice and prompt at giving us water and menus when we sat down. She also let us know about the special for the day.   We ordered drinks and some food to share. Their house wine is $1 per ounce and for that price it wasn't bad. We ordered 4 items:  Beef tartare - the beef tartare came with three long pieces of toast to eat with it. I really enjoyed the truffle flavour in the tartare. The texture was really good and flavour was perfect. Not overly salty. They added some mushrooms on the top which was nice added texture and flavour.   Crispy Brussels sprouts - a little bit too sweet but really tasty. Had a nice kick to go with the sweet/tart flavours.   Friday special - cod with beans - the cod didn't seem like it was fresh so a little on the fishy side but the flavours of the sauce and the sear helped mask it a little. It came with some truffled beans, sea asparagus and escarole. The flavours of the fish were good but presentation was definitely lacking. Wish the fish was a little fresher.   Mushroom pasta - strong truffle and mushroom flavours in the sauce which I enjoyed. The pasta was a little undercooked for my liking. I wouldn't really say it's al dente it could have used a couple more minutes in my opinion. But if you like firmer pastas this is for you. Overall I still really liked it but wished they had more actual mushrooms in it.   Overall flavours are good but the prices are a little steep. I feel like there are definitely better places that offer the same kind of food. The ambiance is nice for a couple drinks and appies. Would definitely recommend trying to get a seat outside or roof top if possible."}
{"text":"They're open for lunch. We enjoyed a celebratory lunch here today and really didn't know what to expect. But they surpassed our expectation. The menu was traditional Italian, similar to osteria and mercatto. But they hit the price point and portion size just right. The quality, presentation and service was excellent. Their only weak spot are their desserts and coffee. Personally, I like a desserts that consists of more than a table spoon. Better hit this spot before the word gets out. It's one of those spots that start excellent and may get pretentious over time. But definite worth a try."}
{"text":"Was in Toronto for business decided to go on the recommendation of yelp, and this place did not disappoint. The mushroom pasta and sangria were delicious. The bartenders were helpful and friendly. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"There's something to be said for a restaurant that surpasses your expectations.   I'd heard very good things about this spot before giving it a try.  The only drawback, I was told, was that there is always a super long wait.  Fortunately, I arrived around 7:30 on a Tuesday and there were many open tables both inside and on the rooftop patio (beautiful by the way).    The food was top notch - I had a pizza and salad.  Both were delicious, plated well and a very generous portion.    The service was great - very friendly and upbeat staff.  Overall, a great experience.  I hope to go back and not wait in line!"}
{"text":"Best italian restaurant in toronto i have ever seen. With my friend we shared \"calamarta con gamberi\" (with shrimp and tomato sauce) and \"mafalde ai fungi\" (mushroom sauce). The atmosphere is very friendly. If you wanna hangout this place is the most convenient place. I had a good time.."}
{"text":"I used to work nearby and would come here at least once a month. I've also hosted small dinners here and tried a lot of the items on the menu. I'm obsessed with the beef tartare and usually don't like pizza but I can't get enough of the spinach pizza! The portion for pizza is huge and filling, I recommend you split it with someone else. They also have $1/oz house wine, which is a nice plus- I prefer the white, it's got a peachy taste! Tip: If you're coming by car, the cheapest spot to park is the Loblaws underground parking nearby! It's only a couple minute walk away from Gusto :)"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner and tried a few different dishes: the kale salad and lentil dish for appetizers. Had the mushrooms pizza and veal rigatoni for main course. The everything was good overall. I would say the apps specially were a touch too bland. The lentils dish needed a sauce or some lemon juice or something. The pizza was great. The rigatoni was ok but not the best. The place has a very cool atmosphere and the staff was very nice. The prices are reasonable. I would definitely go there again...probably mainly for the vibe and drinks.   Food: 3.75/5 Atmosphere and staff: 4.75/5 Prices: 4.5/5 Overall: 4/5"}
{"text":"To the Chef: Thank you so much for the warm welcoming and the treats!!!! We tried Octopus for the first time tx to you and it was.... Awesome! Thanks for the second round of cookies! We loved everything about this restaurant. The food is EXQUISITE! The atmosphere is rad!!!!"}
{"text":"Great brunch, this will be my go to when I travel to Toronto. The brunch was amazing and the staff was also 5 star! See you soon Gusto!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to come to this place for my friends 30th birthday.  I can tell you it was a mission finding a place in the city to accommodate a large party for a Friday night.  After months of searching and reading lots of party contracts from various restaurants we landed on  Gusto 101.   The reason we picked Gusto was 1. location, 2. reviews on food, 3. the minimum spend wasn't astronomical and they mentioned we would have a semi-private seating space.   Well, let me breakdown my/our experience as things started going from bad to worse.   We arrived and went upstairs to the \"semi-private\" dining area, which was their rooftop, and I guess the semi-private portion of the space was that we were placed along the wall.  There was zero privacy let alone semi-privacy.  Nevertheless, we were happy to be celebrating.   We started to grab our seats and I had switched from sitting next to someone to across from them.  The waiter, in one of the rudest tones stated \"If you are going to move around then you can't have separate bills.  I will not be the accountant\".  I was completely taken off guard by his demeanor, but I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt that he just had a lapse in judgement.    The evening proceed with us all sitting down, ordering drinks and enjoying the $45/family style dining option.  It included a delicious Kale Salad and the mushroom pasta was amazing.  The nice thing about this menu was that in included 5oz of house wine (sold by the $ - which is amazing) or a beer.  I ordered a 9oz glass to start and was going to pay for the differential of the 4oz.  As the evening continued, and we enjoyed our meals and drinks, the guest of honour had asked the waiter to pass something on his way down the line to an individual.  It was tough for us to get in and out due to the seating and it wasn't really easy to move down the aisle. The same waiter who started off the evening with a bad attitude continued by stating \"I am here to take care of you guys, you take care of each other\" and walked off.  Fair, he isn't our personal courier, but come on - you are expecting a 18% auto gratuity - at least pretend to have some type of hospitality, tact and professionalism.    The evening has come to an end and we ask for our bill.  Here is where the whole experience comes to the grand conclusion of errors and bad business ethics.  Our bill consisted of 2 family style dining plates, 4 - 9oz glasses of wine.  With the family style dining (as mentioned above) we are entitled to receive 5oz as part of the $45.  We flagged down the waiter to request that we get credit for the 2 x 5oz glasses of wine.  He took our bill, mentioned that the waiter must have thought we already had our wine...well after the stern talking to about moving around, I assumed my bill should be 100% correct.  We receive our bill and notice an \"administrative fee\" - which I was aware of when reading the contract.    Now lets all take a minute to mull over the fact that restaurant charges 3% of a $2,100 minimum spend to book a table for you.  For the sake of accuracy - their contract states the following \"an administration fee of 3% of the minimum spend requirement, will be charged to the credit card on file upon booking\".  Simple math leads me to believe that 3% of $2,100 = $63.00.  There were 32 of us at the table - so as per their contract and billing us individually for the fee it means each of us should be paying $1.90 to cover that cost.  Gusto 101 decided that they would charge us each of us individually 3% of our total bill. After  checking out the numbers - Gusto would be walking away with =/- $100 for administrative fees.  So a nice pocketing of an additional $37.00 just for booking us a table.  Now for the coup de grâce, Gusto decided to apply their 18% tip to the final taxed amount.  As a consumer, we agree to pay a tip on our food and liquor total; however, tipping on tax (the governments money) is not appropriate in my opinion.  I can comment that the tip differential is not that high, but when you add it up among everyone...it becomes a pretty nice number.  I also don't think I would not have had a problem tipping the 18% on the tax amount if we had a server who was polite.  In all honesty, the individual deserving a 18% tip was the server ruining around taking individual orders from all the other tables on the rooftop, not the rude, inconsiderate individual we had serving our table, who just plopped down one dish after another and who we had to flag down to order a drink.  For most situations I like to give a restaurant the benefit of the doubt, and more likely than not give them another shot. Unfortunately, with these unethical penny wise pound foolish business practices I will never step foot in here again.  I will also make sure that I advise people of the way this company conducts itself.  Truly disappointing."}
{"text":"I often take friends here when we're looking for casual Italian in Toronto. Usually I'll make a reservation at one of their limited time spots (6pm); however, the few times we've had to wait for a table we were fortunate enough to secure a seat at the bar.   Place has a nice upstairs with a glass roof which is nice for the spring and summer. We love the Kale salad, the octopus and the mushroom pasta here. Foodwise there are other Italian places I would recommend if someone said they wanted 'good-great' Italian. However, when you couple the decent menu, prices and lively atmosphere, this remains our go-to Italian place. Also, can't beat the $1/OZ special they have on their table red and white wines."}
{"text":"We went here on a Monday night around 5:30 and it was quite busy. The wait staff was very friendly and accommodating. The Brussels sprouts and homemade bread was delicious. We also got the mushroom pasta. My girlfriend and I found it just mediocre and didn't know what the hype was about."}
{"text":"Before I begin to say anything, I have to get this out: The Beef Carpaccio! Oh my goodness - it is STELLAR! You need to try it.  With that being said, I went to Gusto 101 late afternoon on a Saturday. The hostess and waiter were both very friendly and knew the menu better than the back of their own hands. They were more than happy to share their personal favourites (which, later on, became my personal favourites). The grilled octopus, although nowhere near as spectacular as the aforementioned carpaccio, was also a notable highlight of our meal.  I will definitely be back here in the near future. The menu has quite the girth to it and the next time I go, I plan to try one of their many pasta dishes. The table adjacent to us was having a field day of compliments when theirs arrived and I need to know what the fuss is about."}
{"text":"Always a great choice. Good food. Good drinks and affordable prices. Plus the ambience is great"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! We got the pizza with prosciutto and arugula and it was absolutely delicious. The atmosphere was so cozy and the staff was so friendly. We were surprised with 3 types of dessert and it was to die for - would 100% go back!"}
{"text":"This place has a really neat vibe. You can sit inside, outside on a patio, or on the rooftop area which is all windows but is actually 'inside'. I visited on a Monday night and it was packed. They don't take reservations, but there wasn't a wait when I arrived.   The menu had a great selection of options and I had quite a hard time deciding what to get. I landed on the mushroom pasta, which was amazing. The atmosphere was busy, but the sound level made it easy to have normal conversation.   Overall a fantastic experience. I would love to go back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Food was bland, not at all interesting. The trout tasted like farmed salmon kept in fridge a little too long. Service was spotty. Ambience was cool. Don't eat here....go for drinks w friends. Nice outdoor seating areas. Hip atmosphere."}
{"text":"came here for a quiet night out and we stumbled across this cute, small place... just love the rustic decor.....really makes you feel at home, or in an italian kitchen! the wines were delish!  as were their homemade gourmet pizzas...a place to definitely visit again..... it can be hard to miss if your driving by, but once you've found it......consider yourself lucky :)"}
{"text":"Today is my second day in Toronto and I love this city! Last night we had dinner at Gusto's (which means tasty in Italian). The restaurant was rated the Top Italian Restaurant of 2017 in Toronto which I'm confidant was given to them for their Mafalde ai Funghi, which is literally to die for! I mean who doesn't love a rich truffle? This dish consists of portobello, porcini, oyster mushrooms and the most mouth watering truffle cream sauce you've ever had.   The second dish I was very impressed with was the Cavalo Nero!  This dish changes the way I've ever felt about a kale salad. It's BOMB. The salad consists of organic lacinato kale, zante currants, toasted pine nuts, pecorino, parmigiana, and a delicious lemon vinaigrette.   The ambience felt more of a local crowd, who were just dining at their favorite neighborhood spot. In the context of just casual dinning I couldn't give Gusto's any less than 4 Stars."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in Toronto. So delicious (I always order the kale salad and mushroom pasta) and is in a great area (so many other great places to grab a drink on King West). I love the vibe, and the service has always been great. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Toronto has no shortage of great restaurant. Gusto 101 is on the top of this list. Salsicce pizza will change your life and I've never had a better kale salad. Luckily for me, you can find the recipe online."}
{"text":"i come here strictly for the mafalde as i'm sure many do! it's a guilty pleasure, as i'm obsessed with with anything truffle. i am always satisfied and honestly will probably never get sick of it. the kale ceasar is also perfect to balance out the pasta i indulge in. i have had the appetizer platter once and honestly it was underwhelming - we didn't finish it at all. the pizza is good as well, i just never really order anything when i come, i already know! oh and the fresh bread here was always something to look forward to when waiting for our food. however,  they started charging for it which is an absolute bummer! regardless, i always recommended gusto, it's one of my top 5 places in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place is buzzing on weekends and after I came here, I can see why. It has a chill yet cool ambiance. The food is great and not overly pricey. It also has good selections on appies, mains, and drinks! I also love that they have a rooftop that opens up in the summer where you can literally dine under the stars. However, beware of long wait times for drinks and dinner."}
{"text":"Came here based on the high rated reviews and I was not disappointed at all in service, food and ambience...  In the beginning, we asked for a bigger table but due to the party size, they refused to budge with that even though we mentioned we will order alot of food which was our intention since we were both very hungry...  So we ended up getting a small table with not alot of space to place our items and we could have barely ordered an entree each as I would have guessed that it wouldn't fit 2 dishes..so they asked if we would sit in the tall tables...we were ok with that thinking we'd get the full tall tables to ourselves but that was not the case...  We ordered the grilled octopus, pasta, pizza, paté and another item...I forgott the name...  The food was very delicious and we were being checked upon in a reasonable time frame...the ambience is more loud...not a fine dining place obviously..but you will not be disappointed in the foood and service which is more than 66% according to my personal standards...2/3 important items hit..!!   It is slightly on the pricey side but I will come back!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is amazing - location, staff, patio and food! Very delicious food - wood fired grill makes a big difference. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Wow - this place is the bomb and lives up to the hype! Well worth the 1.5 hour wait!  What we had:  Calamari - they got it right here. Using fresh, not frozen, squid and seasoned batter (very rarely done in Toronto as most places don't bother to season) fried to perfection and made to order. Hella-yea good  Only wished the portion was larger.   Carpaccio: the only dish I was disappointed with. Too small, the beans and cilantro over powered the dish and over priced.   Spinach pizza: excellent pizza crust and an amazing topping:cheese:crust ratio. Only regret was not ordering their funghi pizza the server recommended.   Squid ink pasta: very delicious and excellent portion size.   Best for last! Funghi fettuccine: this is most definitely OMG-delicious. I didn't order it but my friends were kind enough to give me some (that was only because they hadn't taken a bite yet otherwise they would never share with me - yes it's that good). The mushroom flavour was highlighted brilliantly with the truffle sauce, butter and cream. The pasta was al dente and the entire dish just worked. It was the highlight of the evening and we found ourselves talking about this dish hours after the meal. Heck I'm still reminiscing about it two days later. A must try!!  House wine: only $1 an oz. You read right, one dollar ($1) per oz. At that price there's no reason not to order a glass.   Service: very attentive despite the chaos around us. The manager even came by and chatted with us. Probably because we couldn't stop throwing complements about the food to the waitress.   Overall: this place is amazing and I would come back even knowing there's a long wait. Will probably get better in the summer because they will double their capacity with their roof top and front patios. Five stars for sure!"}
{"text":"I had to plan a team dinner with 18 people for work and we decided on Gusto 101. Speaking to the staff about the reservation was friendly and straightforward. On the night of, our server was attentive and easy to get along with.  The interior and ambience is trendy but classy. The price point is not surprising for a restaurant in Toronto. Most importantly, the food is delicious. The kale caesar salad and arancini balls to start were unforgettable. Having been back a few times, the pasta is always delicious. Can't go wrong with a meal at Gusto."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch/brunch on a sunny Sunday. This place is edgy and beautiful. The rooftop terasse reminds me of Chicago ! We were a big group without reservations and we got sitted pretty quickly. The staff is very helpful and nice I had an amazing plate of funghi pasta. The truffle wasn't too overpowering.  My friends had the frittata and they really enjoyed it.  I had a piece of a spinach pizza, it was divine.  For desert, we shared buckwheat pancakes.  The letdown for me was the banana bread, I felt it lacked moisture."}
{"text":"You musto go to Gusto (yup it's cheesy but who cares..lol).  Didn't have reservations and came here on a Sunday afternoon - 3pm-ish.  Luckily got one of the tables up front by the bar for a group of 4 people.  There is a patio in the front and a roof top patio as well (I believe the rooftop one only opens after 6pm from what I was told by the server.)  But since it was butt hot that day we luckily sat inside.  We ordered a few dishes to share - the octopus (found this to be a little on the salty side and a tiny bit rubbery); the kale salad, the arancini (wild mushroom risotto balls) which were great and the Salsicce pizza (ground fennel sausage, mozzarella , roasted peppers )- pretty good!    This place is BUSY no matter what time so make reservations if you really want to check it out.  Also inside the restaurant is narrow so you will be in close proximity to others.  The long table at the front is right by the entrance so as people are walking in and out it gets kind of annoying, but overall if was a delicious experience."}
{"text":"Brunch is average.  Prosciutto omelette: 3/5. a bit too salty. Could have put more work into side grilled vegetable.  Lemon blueberry pancake: 3.5/5. Lemon sauce tastes artificial."}
{"text":"Came here at 1:00 AM on a Saturday. The place is winding down but the servers are still attentive. Ordered pizza with prosciutto and it was good. Also, ordered creme brulee and it was very tiny portion. Their cocktail bar is small so they don't have a full stock. I tried to order a lychee martini but they don't have that. I ordered a glass of Muscato instead. I will come back again for their weekend brunch."}
{"text":"I have been here twice since the grand opening of the highly anticipated Gusto 101.. Walking to Jimmy's for coffee for the last little while, I had been keeping a close look out on when this place would be opened and when it finally did, I hardly waited before stepping into this gorgeous industrial space, will of beautiful lighting, high ceilings and wooden furniture that gives it a rustic, yet comfortable feeling.  On my first visit, I came with a friend just for drinks. The hostess and waitress were overly excited and happy.. a little overbearing, i have to say.. I felt like they were forcing their smiles on me. Their menu is large collection of papers pinned to a clipboard so it was difficult locating where the cocktails were... so I asked out server, and she pointed me to the.... GRAPPAS. I'm not an expert with names, concoctions, or Italian, but I know that Grappas are sweet wines, and not cocktails. Good thing I had read Natalie T's reviews and were able to locate her recommendations and made an executive decision to try their ultra strong drink - the one with the orange bitters (can't remember it's name). It was very strong as I had anticipated, though I have to say the size of the cocktail cup was quite small for the price. I also had a negroni americano (campari, vermouth, soda) and I thought it was made very nicely. Everything that came out of the kitchen smelled incredible and I was really excited to come back for the food. We had been sat along the wall with the banquet and I must say that the tables are WAY too close. I can't say I'm a big girl and I could barely squeeze out feeling like I was intruding on the table next to us.  On my second visit, I took my BFF here for her birthday dinner (her choice, but I was definitely excited to finally taste what I had been smelling on my first visit). It was around 6:30 and there were probably 5 tables available. Not wanting to sit along the squished banquette tables, we were lucky to get a table on the main centre aisle, although there wasn't a lot of extra breathing room with people walking by and my chair getting banged several times, and people would be bring chairs across the restaurant and I thought that I was going to get hit in the head. Our waiter was very courteous, and very knowledgeable of everything on the menu. We got the escarole salad to start with walnuts, onion and truffle vinaigrette ($9.95). The escarole had a beautiful crunch to it and a lovely scent of truffle with every bite. The walnuts and onion added some punch and bite and I thought it was a lovely start to our meals.  For the mains, I got the 3-mushroom parppadelle with truffle paste and light cream - I was told that it would be very mushroomy and I was very excited because I don't eat them very often - portebello, oyster, porcini ($14.95). When it arrived, I was actually disappointed to see that there were hardly any mushroom PIECES (maybe 3 - 4 little ones), but other than that, thee pasta dish contained mushroom shavings that created the overall taste. The dish was very tasty, not overly heavy and a good texture, but can't say I was completely satisfied. The pasta is NOT made in house, but I was told it was \"fresh.....\"  My bf got the brandzino ($21.95), which the fish is seared in house (making it super fresh). It was recommended by our server so she went with that. I have to say that this dish was very good, with a very evident citrus coating that erupted your taste buds. The sauteed greens were nice and crunchy, and I preferred her dish over mine in the end.  We decided to try the desserts because the waiter really did sell them well. Knowing that they were little bites in the size similar to a shot glass, we got the lemon ice and the chocolate fudge brownie with caramel sauce and rock salt. If I had known that it was $3.95 / shot, I would have passed because I didn't think it was worth it at all. The lemon air was pretty much that in a shot glass. I didn't feel like there was any substance to it although there was a very potent lemon taste. Nothing really sat on my tongue as it evaporated in an instant. There were little pieces of lemon jelly that had a lot of flavour, but that was it. The chocolate dessert came in a very cute little jar, but only half full. It was very dense, and lacking caramel sauce. The rock salt was extremely overpowering so if you didn't know (which I didn't) and took very little chocolate in your bite, it would really turn you off.  Having been here twice, I was sooooo excited to try their in house made wine. The first time I came, they were out and told me that it would be by the end of the next week. I came two weeks later on my second visit, only to find out that they still did not have any wine and it wouldn't be ready until... the following week. Unfortunately, maybe I'm just going to wait it out and hope that the next time someone suggests to eat here, the wine will be back.  Highlight - FOCACCIA BREAD TO START. Delicious!"}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. However , they only have brunch on weekends till 4 pm. Luckily we can still order the infamous mafalde.   The food:   The mafalde is good but not as good as I expected.  The sauce is creamy but a bit lack of flavour.   The meatball pizza is beyond my expectation. The tomato sauce is so tasty and flavourful, and the crust is very thin.   The tiramisu is a must order. It's not too sweet and yet still very satisfying. Another dessert we had is Pere and it tastes good as well.   The service:  Service is good and fast."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend and our dinner was great! Service was quick even though it was busy. I ordered the mushroom pasta and my friend ordered the rigatoni. We both agreed that the mushroom pasta was better. Highly recommend the mushroom pasta, it was delicious. We also ordered the grilled octopus and a salad. Everything tasted great. I will return for the food especially the mushroom pasta!"}
{"text":"Gusto 101 is an authentic Italian restaurant with two patios - one on the first floor and another on the rooftop. The restaurant had a vintage theme to it. It was obvious with its metal signs and photographs hung on the walls. I'd recommend all the food that we ordered.   For drinks, we ordered Peroni's and Iced Teas.   We shared a Spinaci Pizze, which is a garlic oil based pizza topped with fresh ricotta, buffalo mozzarella, pecorino, spinach, and garlic.   In addition to the pizza, we shared two pastas - Ravioli Alla Norma and Calamarata con Gamberi. The Ravioli Alla Norma consisted of three rectangular spinach and ricotta ravioli topped with sauteed eggplant, basil, tomato sauce, and ricotta salata. It was delicious and surprisingly filling. The Calamarata con Gamberi consisted of paccheri (fat, large tube like pasta), wild shrimp, cherry tomato, chilies, marjoram, and parsley cooked in tomato sauce. It was great for those who like it spicy."}
{"text":"Love this Italian restaurant - it's a but pricy but this place is one of the best Italian restaurant in Toronto. Tried risotto ball which was so good and mushroom pasta. Yum!"}
{"text":"My husband and some friend went here a few weeks ago. The weather was warm and the ambience is amazing. I ordered a simple margarita pizza which was delicious! My friends ordered pasta which also was great. This is such a great spot for outdoor dining as the location setup and vibe is great! The beer was expensive compared to the amount you got type of thing. I'm giving this a 3 start due to stale dessert that is not fresh or even warmed up to pretend to be fresh...lol come on fake that it is fresh. It was hard as a rock and not very good. I believe it was the chocolate tort."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a friend, and ordered pumpkin ravioli, which came in a brown butter and sage sauce. It was good, if a little over-sweet, but as soon as I got home I got very ill. Not sure what it was, but I have a cast iron stomach and rarely if ever get sick from food, so it surprised me. Other things to note: - When I went, the restaurant was jam-packed. The tables are squeezed close together and it was super loud. A busy restaurant can be a good thing, but the atmosphere just felt a bit chaotic and it was too loud to have a conversation without shouting slightly. - After my friend and I both ordered pastas, the server asked if we wanted a basket of bread for $4. I think that in an Italian restaurant, especially if you order pasta, it's a little ridiculous to charge for bread. Especially when you're paying $19 for pasta, which isn't expensive but isn't necessarily cheap either.  The only good thing is the wine - they do house wine for a dollar an ounce which is very reasonable, and unlike many other restaurants, their house wine (at least the white, which I had) is actually fantastic."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here on Saturday late afternoon, early evening.  We were seated right away, and the space/ambiance has a really nice vibe, good flow to the room and we came with our 6 year old kid, and we weren't seated next to the bathroom (another big plus).  Service was top notch!  Ordered the rapini and the truffled fries as starters.  Both were cooked well and plentiful.  The bread basket was complimentary, and contained big pieces of fluffy, chewy bread.  For an entree, I had the spaghetti nero with seafood -- excellent all around.  The kid had rigatoni pomodoro with a huge dollop of fresh mozarella on top -- also delicious and well received.  The husband had the strip steak with portabello mushrooms, roasted potatoes and he was extremely happy.    What I found awesome was that they sold their house red wine $1 per ounce.  My 6 ounce of wine, quickly doubled into 12.  It was THAT good.  Dessert was good -- chocolate quinoa cake for the kid and an an apple tart like thing for myself.  The espresso is delicious.  I meant to ask them what beans they use...something to ask for the next time!  :)"}
{"text":"Definitely a gem.  I've been here twice and both were amazing.  WARNING: It does tend to get really noisy indoors. Try to get a seat out in patio as you can, you'll get a chance to actually talk to your company.   But otherwise, it's amazing. Amazing service, amazing food, amazing atmosphere.   Carpaccio  beef tenderloin, truffled cannellini beans, pecorino,  micro greens (13.95) : Beautifully thin sliced carpaccio. It was amazing, I have no clue how they do it. 5/5. It is a small portion, however if you love carpaccio, you should definitely give this a try.   Polipo  grilled octopus, olive tapenade, celery root puree, chorizo, pea  shoots, smoked paprika emulsion (14.50): Recommended by the server. And now, recommended by me. This is actually a pretty decent serving, and as well, it's superb. The octopus is cooked lovely; not too chewy,but tough enough to give you a bit of a bite.   Salmone alla Brace  salmon, quinoa, heirloom beet and carrot slaw,  lemon, avocado chimichurri (22.95):  Salmon and quinoa. Such a health dish, but a must try for seafood lovers. The salmon is cooked to your liking (medium would be the best. just cooked enough to bring out the fat, but not enough where it would be too dry.) The quinoa is also great to keep you nice and full. I couldn't even finish the dish! 5/5 (or more if I could ... oh heck, how about 7/5. I like the number 7.)  Gusto Caesar 1.5 oz (12.00) Served with house made pickels:  I love Caesars so I'm totally biased for this. I loved it. Of course I don't like pickles and olives, but I'm sure they were good. I love the spiciness on top of the vodka. The spiciness is the best.   Overall, this place is somewhere you would take a date. There's a great romantic atmosphere, and great south Italian food. The first time I was here, I had the pizza that I can barely finish and I still remember how great it was. Of course Queen Margarita is my favourite, but if I were to cheat it would be between here and Pizzeria Libretto."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Gusto.  They have an awesome rooftop patio for the summer and a number of first-come-first-serve bar top areas you can sit at while you wait for your table.  They have $1 an ounce red and white house wine, both of which are really good.  The food, service, value, and ambiance at this place are great.  Have taken friends lots of times and this place never disappoints.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, great staffs, Delicious food and nice music. Everything is great. we had pizza, pasta and homemade bread. all right portion and so good. their house red wine is good.  I will be back"}
{"text":"Wine lovers rejoice! Pizza Lovers rejoice!  Hell, everyone rejoice! AMAZING industrial design gives this restaurant a great atmosphere.   Bright and heated rooftop patio and ground patio gives this place ample room for all those friends you'll be bringing by. The beer options are limited, but the wine is flowing bright!  Four words, WINE BY THE OUNCE! From winemaker Alejandra de Miguel from Vintage - it is certainly worth a try!  Go. GO NOW!"}
{"text":"Not going to labor this one. Three  words: Dull, uninspired food."}
{"text":"Love the food at Gusto! The food is phenomenal.  The patio in the summer is great and I also love dining in the upper level for something different are airy."}
{"text":"Gusto101 has a very nice ambiance - dim and candlelit.  We were seated on the second floor, the crowd wasn't as big when we arrived - it started to pick up by the hour. There was some confusion with the seating arrangements but overall, service was good.  Carpaccio Very yummy - tasted very fresh. The truffled cannellini beans were a good match with the beef tenderloin.  Mafalde ai Funghi AMAZING :) I'd come back to eat this again.. the truffle and cream sauce were delicious!! Loved everything about this dish :D  Prosciutto e Rucola 3/5 - probably because the pasta was too amazing, the pizza didn't stand out as much for me haha"}
{"text":"pretty decent place, I went to dinner here years ago but did brunch recently. Staff is friendly, food is good. The bar menu is great so go here for drinks on a weekday to avoid the crowd."}
{"text":"Didn't feel this place was anything special, especially for the long line ups. It was very loud in here (poor acoustics) and it was difficult to hear people talk at your table. The food was decent but not amazing. Had the raved mushroom fettucine and it was a bit too creamy. The pizza was standard and nothing special. Will come back if others suggest it but probably not otherwise because of the long lineups"}
{"text":"I was there yesterday with couple italian friends for dinner . the veneu is great , has alot of space, and it is literally packed on a Wed night. We had the Ravioli ,Rigatone, insalata e Pizza. good food but the portions were small for the price! I took a whole pizza after my Ravioli. and I am not a huge person at all.   Pros:great venue, patio, roof, and downstairs, great food and friendly staff. Cons: small portions for the price. and we were out at the patio, and several tables were asking to put a space heater outthere since it was a cold night, Gusto declined!  PS: do Not park in the parking next to it for crazy 15$!!! streat parking or few steps north of Adelaide there is a good parking for 6$ flatrate."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for awhile, and finally came here with a girlfriend for some eats and drinks.  The industrial decor was trendy and welcoming.  Although we sat on the top floor, it was cold outside so the roof top patio was covered.  I can't wait to come back in the summer.    The service was excellent!  My friend and I were being adventurous with the drinks, so we had our waitress surprise us a few times, and she always came back with something that suited our requests.  They have a variety of cheap wines that we enjoyed with dinner.  The food was absolutely delicious.  We shared a pizza and the mushroom pasta (omg drool).  Perfect amount of food.    I cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"I've been back twice and this place is getting upgraded to 5 star.  The interior is RIDICULOUS. So sexy. I've never seen a garage conversion done so well. Would be amazing place for a private party. Rooftop terrace is badass.   The wine on tap (made in their own basement cellar) was actually quite good, I tried a glass of the red. $1 per oz is not too shabby either.   They have a daily special, so yesterday I tried the meatballs for $14. There were 3 huge (nearly fist sized - okay - small woman fist-sized) meatballs topped with fresh tomato sauce, plate drizzled with olive oil and some small crispy toasts served in the side. The meatballs were delicious and seemed quite lean, which was a nice surprise.  My dining companions tried a pizza (the one with prosciutto) and a penne pasta served with lamb shank. We also had a calamari appetizer (SO GOOD - perfectly cooked calamari, not chewy, served like onion rings with a dipping sauce).   The service here is truly remarkable - waitstaff are knowledgeable about food and they are quite attentive.   Best of all, the bill only came to $100 after tax and tip, for 3 people. That included 2 beers and 2 glasses of wine. Can't complain."}
{"text":"We came to Gusto to celebrate a birthday and decided to do the family-style menu for 8 people. We chose the Nonna's Family-Style Menu for $45 a person. The food was plentiful and as advertised, none of us went home hungry! We also got seated upstairs in the patio area. This was good because it's extremely crowded on the main floor so I had issues hearing my friends from across the table the last time I came here.   My fave dishes were: 1. Arancini - it looked like a risotto ball. When I tasted it, I was presently surprised at the texture of it. It was very moist. I liked the combination of the arborio rice and fontina. Very tasty!  2. Polpette Pizza - this was a great choice! I loved the meatball. It was very tasty 3. Insalata Cavolo Nero - this was a perfect blend of kale, currants and pine nuts. The pine nuts gave it an extra crunch, which was very nice in the mouth! 4. Rigatoni ai Funghi - this was my absolute fave dish. The pasta was cooked al-denta. The sauce was rich and creamy. When paired with the oyster mushrooms, the combo was delicious! There was no left overs for this dish! 5. Pollo al Mattone - basically grilled chicken with potatoes. The chicken was very flavourful and moist. A classic dish.  Overall, the menu was delicious and filling. I would give this restaurant on food alone a 4/5. However, I was not impressed with that the fact the restaurant charged us a plating fee of $3 per person to eat a birthday cake that we brought from outside. I was extremely disappointed at this because the server did not give enough plates and also, did not cut the cake for us. I expected for $3 a person, the server would cut the cake and serve it to us. Not impressed by this at all.  It's also worthwhile to mention that the bathrooms are unisex. It was interesting to go into the washrooms and see boys coming out!"}
{"text":"The place is awesome, crowded and noisy :) Great place to go with friends.   The food is very good but similar too many other places downtown."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and the decor on the first floor. The covered porch upstairs is also great. Service and host were fabulous! Good menu and great drinks list!"}
{"text":"I recently came back to Gusto (about a year since my first visit) and I had a great meal once again. This time I unfortunately didn't book in advanced enough to get a spot on the patio, but I can now safely say the inside the restaurant is as nice an option. It wasn't too loud or crowded and it was fun to be able to watch the chefs in action as it is an open kitchen area."}
{"text":"The food is pretty mediocre here, not the best Italian food out there. The atmosphere is great out on the patio on a nice summer day, but would only come here again for the atmosphere/drinks rather than the food."}
{"text":"I really don't  get the hype surrounding Gusto. When I went, we were welcomed by hostesses who were most unwelcoming and were switched around 3 times before being seated at our final table... Although the menu was interesting at first glance, once on the table, I found the plates to be lacking in taste and quite ordinary. Simply put, I won't be making this a go-to spot on my future trips to TO."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  I ate here for the first time 2 years ago, and I am so happy that the quality of food and service has remained awesome!  It is always so frustrating when you find a restaurant you love that has great service, great food and great ambiance, then a year later, it takes a huge dive.  I had the Mafalde ai Funghi and a side of Salmon...Delicious.  I had had the Mafalde ai Funghi before and it is a dish that I randomly think about when I am back in California.  When I ordered the salmon, the server asked \"how would you like the salmon cooked?\" ...How often does that happen??  and when it arrived, it was cooked perfectly :)  I love this place."}
{"text":"Update: We decided to give Gusto 101 another shot after Kathleen from Gusto 101 reached out to me on Yelp. We got to reserve a table for two at 8:30pm on a Friday. We were seated upstairs near the windows.   We ordered: 1) 17oz of house wine  Still good. It has a nice subtle sweetness to it, tastes like a flat prosecco-- in a good way!   2) Shishito peppers Still amazing!!!! Seriously, you need to order these. There's some really spicy peppers mixed with some more mild. Felt like shishito pepper roulette when we were eating them because you never knew when you would get a really spicy one. We decided to get this brought out the same time as the mains because we wanted to eat the peppers with our pasta and pizza!   3) Regina Margherita pizza  Our waiter was very knowledge about the food and let us know the buffalo mozzarella had a lot of moisture to it, and we could opt to get it overdone a little to combat this. We opted for it to just be cooked regular, but appreciated the insight into the dish. The pizza had a great thin crust, nice amount of tomato sauce. The mozzarella was sliding around a bit but this was due to the aforementioned moisture in the cheese. The shishito peppers + the crust on this pizza made for a delicious combo!   4) Calamarata with shrimp  Gusto 101 does a good job of cooking their pasta al dente. The sauce was very aromatic from the shrimp, had a little bit of spice in it but I asked for some chili flakes on the side. They cut the shrimp in the pasta... something I've never seen in a restaurant in my life. The shrimp was cooked well and still juicy, but it was quite unusual to see cut up shrimp in the dish as usually in my experience shrimp is kept whole. Hard to tell portion size of shrimp due to this, but it was a good balance between shrimp and the pasta.   Final thoughts:  Overall I'm glad we tried Gusto 101 again. I appreciate Kathleen reaching out to us, and Christine also checked in on us at the end of the meal. Their service was excellent this time around, shout out to our waiter as well. The shishito peppers is a must, and I think the Calamarata trumps the Malfade ai Funghi by far! We had a nice evening and would try Gusto 101 again."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for drinks, terrific unique cocktails.  Friendly staff and the rooftop is a big hit as well if it's a nice night"}
{"text":"Had to wait 2 hours for a table for 5. Although the food was good, it could not make up for the time we wasted waiting. The staff definitely needs to figure out how to coordinate tables better. If she had told us it was a 2 hour wait we would have gone to a different restaurant. Do take advantage of their house wine special - $1 per ounce, both red and white available. Would return to try other dishes at a less busy time - if there is such a time."}
{"text":"i loved this place - atmosphere was nice.  the sangria was awesome!  so light and refreshing...  the arancini is bigger than i am used to - but thats not a bad thing. i was torn on a couple dishes... however the funghi one was recommended to me by a friend and the waitress said people come in saying they had dreams about eating it... so i went with that and was not disappointed.  sometimes ppl use too much truffle oil and it ends up tasting like gasoline!  which is why i am so sketchy about anything with truffle oil... but this did not disappoint.  my waitress was super friendly and the portions and prices were pretty decent."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the $1/oz wine on tap (tried white). The red sangria was good too - not strong, tastes like fruit punch.  Complimentary bread is soft and soaks up the olive oil - delicious.  Beef tartare - perfect pairing with the crostini, good truffle oil flavour. Although the presentation worried me a bit (a bit mushy and brown when I was expecting more vibrant red/pink meat), it ended up tasting alright. A good choice if you don't want something too heavy to eat in the heat.  Mushroom pasta & the mackerel special are good too.   The only thing is it's quite hot on the patio with a few flies, but noise level is quieter than inside."}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner a few times. The pastas are always amazing and pizzas are great.  The lunch and dinner menus are definitely better than brunch. Sucks that there's no pasta during brunch. The Mushroom Bruschetta on the brunch menu's very good. $13 for three small pieces is a bit pricey though.  The Pizza all'Uova can be missed. The eggs basically become way over easy by the time you eat it.  Their housemade focaccia is very good.  Their Mafalde ai Funghi is a must. Polpette pizza is a good classic. Good amount of meatballs. Diavola pizza is good if you like spicy.  Order some chili oil for your pizza."}
{"text":"Came here without any reservation, eventually me and my friends had to wait for an hour in the nearby McDonald's to get in.  I tried their All-time-famous mushroom pasta. But so sad to say I didn't know there's gonna be so much cream in the dish and I ain't dig cream flavors food. (sad face) But I completely understand why people think it's good. Although I didn't like it that much but I think if you like cream you will love it. It's a different and unique flavors than a lot pasta dishes out there. Their roasted Brussels sprouts was yummy I only wish the portion was bigger."}
{"text":"I can see why some people would rave about this place, but personally wasn't impressed.  The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't something I would go nuts about.  Especially since I hate Kale.  I have been a couple times as my date would want to go but won't make reso.  The place is crammed which I hated and super loud.   The steak tartar was good though. Pizza was ok  Drinks though were on point"}
{"text":"We came around 6:15 on a Wednesday evening, and it was pretty busy, with limited seats outside. We ended up upstairs at their skylight seating, which is a rectangular seating area surrounding a large skylight. It wasn't ideal for chatting, but it still had that great rooftop patio vibe.  All three of us ordered pasta, and I was underwhelmed with the quality. I got the 'Lumache con Tonno', but the pasta was undercooked and quite hard (my friend's pasta was also undercooked). The flavours were good, but the dish could've been a lot better.   Our waitress was nice, but service was slow, likely due to the high volume of customers. It was still quite hot out, so the wait was a bit uncomfortable. In addition, their washrooms are in the basement with minimal lighting (I thought I would trip down the stairs). I may come back to try their pizza, but there was nothing standout about my first experience."}
{"text":"Fettuccine ai Funghi. I may have butchered the spelling but pretty much every review on here seems to echo the same sentiment as I. This place gets 4 stars from me just for that dish. Yeah the kale salad is supposed to be amazing but really it wasn't. The veal was okay, the tartare was good but the fettuccine -  that's what you want. We tried a bunch of dishes and didn't finish any but this was demolished. That good."}
{"text":"The mushroom pasta was delicious. Pair it with a glass (or bottle if you like) of primitivo di manduria and you will probably have one of the best Italian meals of your life. Wines are super expensive though. I also ordered the bread pudding in the end and could have done without it."}
{"text":"I Went for a late lunch and the place was packed. When our waiter got to us she was very funny and attentive. If not for that kale salad, their was such a good vibe that I would be back for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Prices are a tad high for the portion you receive. As others recommended, their mushroom pasta is fantastic and seems always be available-even during brunch menu (as it is not listed).  Boyfriend said we will be back and that he doesn't crave much food, but this would be one of those dishes! Aside from high prices & small portions, this place is a must-go."}
{"text":"Two words: sangria and Mafaldie ai funghi. The sangria was amazing, fruity light and refreshing. It was everything a sangria should be. The mushroom pasta was one of the best dishes I've ever eaten. It was creamy and the pasta was al dente and soaked up all the sauce perfectly. We did order some other things like the ravioli allá norma, the margarita pizza, and obviously some bread (it was on the menu that you needed to pay for it but they didn't charge us). The ravioli themselves were delicious but the eggplant was a little underdone and just kind of thrown on top of the ravioli. The pizza had mixed reviews in my group. My boyfriend and I loved it but his sister and her boyfriend found it to be a little thin but still had great flavor! The only thing I wouldn't recommend getting is the mojito! But the service and everything else was awesome."}
{"text":"Gusto is definitely one of my favourite restaurants on King West. They have awesome selection of pasta and pizza with my two favourites being the Mafalde ai Funghi and Pizza Margherita. The only downside here is a portion that is a bit tiny and the loudness, I need to yell to have a conversation with my friends over dinner but delish delish delish. Can't wait to try the octopus dish next time!"}
{"text":"We got the seafood pasta and the braised lamb pasta. Both were way too salty. Felt like we were being pushed out the door when they brought the bill when we didn't ask for it. Overall bad experience."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the patio! Friendly staff and good overall vibes. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Gusto is found just off the busy King Street West and housed inside (what looks to be) an old garage. Walk past the huge mural of Lucy van Pelt in black shades and the entrance is just to the left of the patio space. They don't take reservations on a weekday night, so come early for a table as the place fills up quickly.  I was initially seated all the way at the back of the restaurant by the kitchen entrance. Don't know why I was placed there since there were plenty of other tables available at the time. Unfortunately, I could feel the heat of the wood fire grill from my seat (recovering from a cold but still felt the heat) and had to ask to be moved to another table. The service was great otherwise, just needed to get over the hiccup with the seating.  We had the housemade bread, Cavolo Nero, Ravioli di Zucca, and a pizze (don't remember which one). Everything was well made and delicious and I appreciated the rustic elements of each dish. The portion size is a little small compared to the price, but that is expected for this area of town. The most memorable thing was the focaccia bread, as we had to get two orders of it after our initial bag!"}
{"text":"Mmm, this place is great for Italian food lovers. I had a pasta dish, can't remember the exact name but it was the one in a tartar cream sauce with three different mushrooms. It was so yummy! My friend had a steak and he said it was good too. We also had a side of fries, which were good, but the portion for that was kind of disappointing as it was just a tiny cup of fries. He also had a Spritz, which was good. Service is decent, they don't really check up on you throughout the meal but they are friendly when they come around. I would come back for that pasta dish."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this restaurant for a while now because of the reviews and pics. All I can say is disappointing to the max. Dunno why this place gets such good reviews for mediocre pizza and meh pasta. Got the fungi pasta and hubs got the veal pasta. His was ok, meat portion in pasta good, sauce and flavour was nothing to write home about, did the job cuz he was hungry. Mine just sucked. Barely any mushrooms and dry chewy pasta. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate al dente, but this was, undercooked, unflavoured cardboard to say the least. Had to choke it down bc I was starving. Ordered the margarita pizza after to try to save our meal bc it looked so good at other tables, what can I say it was just meh too. Only positive was that the white tap wine was good that day and worth $1 per oz, needless to say the red was sour af and gross, stay away unless that's how you prefer your red wine then by all means, drink the vinegar. Clearly won't be back and def not a recommend from me or the hubsters. Side note, coffee shop Jimmy's down the street was amaze balls! Stopped off for espressos after dinner and quite honestly one of the best we've had!!"}
{"text":"Went here at about 10pm on a Friday night looking for a good place to hang out. This place is comfortable but trendy.   We ate: - kale salad (5/5) so good I tried to recreate this healthy pleasure! - funghi pasta: (5/5) while absolutely delicious, the bold flavors started to get a little too heavy. I would suggest sharing with someone to change it up! - margherita pizza: (4/5) very yummy, thin crust. Was a little annoyed that I was eating it with a dull knife though! - Anglianico red wine (5/5) cant go wrong  I will be back very soon! Great vibe"}
{"text":"This place is great!  It was busy on a Tuesday night but the staff were attentive and friendly. My friend and I enjoyed the atmosphere on the rooftop terrace where the roof had been opened so we could enjoy the sublime summer weather.  I enjoyed a wonderful pasta, the Bucatini Amatriciana to be exact. The sauce was scarce but the flavour was full. My friend had a pizza and said that it was light yet satisfying. I finished with dessert, who can pass up an icecream sandwich?! It certainly didn't disappoint the coconut not over powering the dark chocolate pieces and the warm brioche bun that wasn't oily.  I'd recommend Gusto 101 to anyone."}
{"text":"the food used to amazing but this time I went there like a month ago and I'd never forget how horrible the chicken tasted. every time I think about the smell it makes me nauseous. the service was really good though"}
{"text":"Had lunch at Gusto this past week. What a great location. It is a two floor restaurant. With a great rooftop patio. We enjoyed the kale salad with pine nuts.  We also had the Polpette salad.  These two offerings were shared by two.  Portions are generous.   They have house red and white wine for $1 per ounce.   Was a totally enjoyable experience and I would go back again in a heartbeat. Lots more to try on the menu. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Got here on a Thursday evening, the place was packed.  I was immediately impressed by the overall vibe of the restaurant. Dimly lit, cute patio, and the decor had a nice rustic feel to it.  We finally got a seat outside, and ordered a jug of wine. Pretty unrelated, but I could not help but notice all the attractive customers lol.  The menu was written in Italian and despite the brief descriptions under each item, I found it a little difficult to navigate my way through it. Thankfully, our waitress was extremely accommodating and did not hesitate to answer any of my questions and relieve some of my anxiety with ordering. I also learned a bit of Italian along the way!  My friend and I decided to go with the Gusto Greens as a starter. I was expecting a typical bed of salad with a few pieces of cheese tossed here and there, but all I will say is that my taste buds did a little dance once the fork entered my mouth.   We played it safe with our main and stuck with the Margherita pizza. OH MY GOODNESS. I don't know if it was all the wine, but I am convinced that the pizza melted in the mouth. Just as good - if not even better than... dare I say... Pizza Libretto (my fave joint).  I will definitely be back and if I'm lucky, maybe I'll even get to experience the rooftop patio!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a business lunch at 2pm on a Friday. I could not believe how busy it was! Since I intended to be chatting about business I had to move to the rooftop patio in order to have a conversation. The atmosphere overall was great. The service was extremely knowledgable and friendly. I ordered a pizza which was delicious but I saw some very exotic dishes going to other tables I'd love to try next time I go!"}
{"text":"I'm sad to say I have to change my review for Gusto 101 based on a recent experience. We came back here, remembering how cool this place was last time. The service was really slow this time, our waiter took forever to come over and ask for our drink order. I asked for the sangria (I had it last time and it was awesome), but he said it was not available because they ran out of Sangria mix. He didn't offer me an alternative so I looked at the menu and chose the house white wine. He then said that the tap for this was broken, and again offered no alternative for us even when we asked what he would recommend instead. He just said \"We don't have anything else at that price point\".  We found something to order for drinks and it took a long time to have them delivered to our table.   We ordered food, and when it came my boyfriend's pasta was cold. We had to tell the waiter, who got us another one. My boyfriend told me this was also not hot, and the pasta didn't seem cooked very well. He was bummed.  My Zuppa di Pollo on the other hand had the opposite problem, and felt like it was 1000 degrees. Even though I waited a while and ate it slowly, it still burned my mouth a little haha. It also didn't have much taste, and was really not exciting. I would not recommend the soup.  The food seemed generally over priced for the size and quality, and the service was terrible. Even though the atmosphere is pretty cool, we won't be back here again."}
{"text":"We had high expectations after reading all the great reviews but Gusto was unfortunately a little disappointing after waiting 1.5 hours for our table. We got a coveted table on the patio, our waitress was friendly and the weather was perfect. The restaurant's vibe was perfect....and then the food arrived. Pasta was heavily salted and after a second  try still inedible. Pasta was undercooked again for the one we kept and other we returned. Prosciutto pizza was good but really not a true test of a great restaurant. Sad to report - great ratings for the vibe but not the food. If you're into great Italian, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"What a great spot for date night or catching up with friends! I came here on a Friday night around 6pm hoping to get a seat on the upstairs patio on one of the first nice Fridays of spring, but it was already full. Note they don't take resos for after 6pm. So, instead, I sat in the downstairs patio, which was not a bad alternative. The restaurant has a rustic vibe, to which I am a fan. The service was quick and friendly: we were quickly acknowledged and seated upon arriving and our server came to greet us and let us know he'd be right with us. I appreciated this as the seating area was quite full, so it's nice to know we were not going to be forgotten. Anyway, the best part of the experience is of course the food. We ordered the truffle fries, fried mozza balls, the mushroom pasta, and a pizza... I would order every dish again.  Food was fresh and delicious.  I think the kale salad is another very popular menu item, as every table around me had that dish on their table.  Overall, this place is great and I'd definitely return... Even just writing this review is making me hungry.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I agree with other yelpers. It's a fun place, King W crowd, and of course it can be crowded. Interesting place to people watch.  Had a mediocre Sangiovese. Too bad we picked a bad one.   As for food, I could have better food on Ossington or Dundas if you know what i mean.   I don't mind trying new places, and paying a bit more for different experience, it's just not great food for what it is. That's all.   I appreciate the good service. Thanks Jorge."}
{"text":"We were 4 who dined at Gusto on Saturday and all of us enjoyed our meal, the service and the ambiance.  Everyone was happy with their appetizers, mains and the house red was awesome! The HIT was the arancini by far.  Our server, Cyrus, was amazing- full of knowledge, fun, and attentive.  I will definitely be back. The price, for the quality of the meal, was beyond reasonable.   *the only drawback is that they only take reservations for noon and 6pm."}
{"text":"Solid delicious italian food.  If I could only give you on piece of advice, it would be to get the mushroom fungi pasta. In fact, get two plates of it because that's what we did! It's singlehandedly the most flavorful creamy delicious plate they serve and will keep me coming back time and time again.  We also have tried some winter hot cocktails here and hit the spot every time.  It's got a sort of a dark swanky vibe, pretty good for a date spot."}
{"text":"I love the mushroom truffle pasta here - it is pretty life changing. They also have a really cute patio."}
{"text":"Been here several times of summer, the pizza is mediocre but the Mushroom pasta is delicious. We had several of the appetizers as well, the kale salad, beef tartare, and tuscan fries and black ink risotto. I'd have to say the beef tartare and kale salad are something you can pass on, nothing that great. I love the ambience and service here, gusto is definitely somewhere our group frequently visits."}
{"text":"I honestly adore this place, especially when it's warm in Toronto. The upstairs or outdoor patio are always where you should be. Pricey place though, but your tastebuds will leave satisfied. I love their desserts a little more than their food, although their pastas are great, so that's saying something. Fun with a large party. It does get pretty loud though, so you might not hear your friends that well lol."}
{"text":"A truly fantastic meal at Gusto, consistently strong appetizers (with a large group I recommend a pizza too), and great entrees. Particularly enjoy the risotto.  Atmosphere is nice as well with open kitchen allowing for you to watch the preparation and enjoy the aromas."}
{"text":"Went last night for the second time. Left kinda disappointed. We wanted a table on the patio, but the hostess said they were all taken and the one on the roof top was overwhelmed because there is only one server up there. We settled for a table inside. We've noticed a lot of staff walking around, not doing much. How about sending some to the rooftop to help. Nobody offered us any bread. I don't know why people keep saying they have amazing bread there when they don't ever serve us any. Our server was nice and food came out pretty quick. My husband ordered the spaghetti with clams like last time, but it was blend, flavourless. I ordered the braised lamb pasta, it was ok, but I found a clam mixed in my pasta. Lucky I wasn't allergic to it. Our friend ordered some fried calamari, he didn't even finish it. Said it was also pretty blend and soggy. The portion for the pasta was very small. We left there still hungry and went to another place to snack after. Gusto, overhyped."}
{"text":"I went last night for the first time with my wife and we had such a good time.  We order the polipo as antipasto because we heard it's really popular and most important really good...I can confirm it! We also ordered 2 pizza, really well cooked original italian style. Dessert and coffe to conclude a really nice experience.  We will come back!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my experience here. Went with a friend that lives in the area and we sat at the bar for a couple glasses of wine and good Italian food. I like their concept of changing the menu often - we started with the grilled octopus app, which seems to be a must have. It was grilled right in front of us and it tasted great. We both had the house wine ($1 per oz.) - it was descent and inexpensive for a city like Toronto. For entree, I had the pasta with lamb and pork and I really liked it - It tasted very fresh and it was well prepared. My buddy had a kale salad and steak and he also liked it a lot. The decor is cool and you can tell the place is trendy and filled with young professionals and locals. I'll definitely come back next time that I'm in the area - just make sure to get there early because it can get pretty busy and waiting can be long."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere for a pre party drinks and their food is also really good. Their octopus is a most try as well their Pizza, it is authentic Neapolitan dough and very tasty."}
{"text":"We go to Gusto a lot for business lunches and it's consistently delicious.  As you approach the restaurant, the smell of the Tuscan wood fire grill is so enticing.  I've had many dishes but a couple that stand out are the Insalata di Salmone; the salmon was like nothing I've ever tasted before as I believe it was cooked on that wood fire grill.  The Cavolo Nero (kale salad) was dressed perfectly, had a nice bite to it and the shaved pecorino was just the icing on the cake.  A couple of my colleagues have had the burger and they said that it was the best burger they've ever tasted in their lives!  Going there again this week and I think I'll try a pizza this time."}
{"text":"Fast service, ordered kale salad it was simple but delicious. And the branzino for my main which was perfect. Will go back again. I suggest reservations as to gets busy"}
{"text":"IM not much for italian food,but this place was cool. i enjoyed my meal very much. I had the endive salad and the seabass for dinner. the atmosphere is nice and the interior is well designed. And to top it offf hot guy waiters!! I would go back !!"}
{"text":"Randomly ended up checking this out on a Sunday evening after mani/pedi's with girlfriends. The place has a cool vibe to it, like most spots on King. We ordered one app, three mains and a dessert to share. The mains were delicious! I got the shrimp pasta and my friend for the truffle cream sauce pasta. The other friend got the burger with a side of  fries and liked that too. I feel the app and dessert were a bit disappointing though! We got the spicy peppers for app and the Nutella filled donut for dessert. I wouldn't recommend those!   Parking is available across the street if you're driving. Spot is also very accessible by transit. Overall a good experience. Will probably give it another shot on the weekend again!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal here last week - Ambiance, service, and food were all on point!  I made a reservation for 6pm and was glad that I did - the restaurant was already busy and the lower floor completely booked up at 5:55pm. We were seated promptly once getting to the host stand.  First, the building itself is gorgeous. The low-lit atmosphere and urban quality make for a hip yet upscale feel.  The food was also highly on point - we had the bruschetta to start, then the mushroom pasta that everyone raves about as well as the veal rigatoni. The bruschetta was really unique, served with mushrooms, what I thought to be gruyere cheese and saffron on a lovely thin-cut crostini. The mushroom pasta was absolutely out of this world, and I was told that the rigatoni was also very good. Can't forget - the house bread was super delicious and definitely worth the carb loading!  Our service was quick and courteous, however he spoke very quietly in a loud environment so I fear I lost some discussion in translation.  We will be back promptly to try pizza and desserts!"}
{"text":"Upscale setting and you get wine on tap!  I had the beef carpaccio and it was heavenly."}
{"text":"Very cozy and hip place. I recommend the roof seating with the skylight bar seating. They were comfortably packed for a Sunday night.  Had the mushroom pasta, one of there signature dishes, and it lived up to expectation! There pizza looks good but was difficult to eat and got soggy quickly."}
{"text":"I would come back again for the atmosphere and cheap in-house wine!  We came here on a Wednesday at around 6pm without making any reservations, yet we were able to sit by the bar on the rooftop which I didn't mind at all. The atmosphere was great. The service here was mediocre, our waiter was very friendly and gave us our space which was what we had wanted.   I ordered the mushroom pasta and it was quite good however not amazing. The pasta was a little hard for my liking. But the sauce was very delicious. I wish there was more mushroom or a variety of mushrooms on side. The in-house red wine was okay. The in-house white wine was not as good as the red -- but for $1 an ounce, I'll take it!   My friend got the kale salad with chicken which I also tried. The kale was quite tender and it was overall good, again, nothing mindblowing.   As mentioned earlier, I'd come back for the rooftop atmosphere and a glass of wine but the food and service is very average."}
{"text":"The Mafalde. Oh Gawd the Mafalde... Earthy, Creamy, succulent, satisfying.... MmmMMMmmm. While you are waiting for this plate of goodness to arrive, grab a negroni and taste the citrus, balanced by the bitter. The best negroni in the city! I've been here about 6 times and although there are amazing dishes/drinks (octopus, beef carpaccio, tartare, arancini), I always come back to the Mafalde."}
{"text":"I loved Gusto!  We got the truffle pasta and pizza with hot salami. Both delicious, cooked to perfection! Drinks were great.  The service was fantastic.  The ambience makes it a Great spot for date night!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I eat here consistently, usually once a week. It delivers every - single - time.  For two people to have an app, a main, and a lot of wine it usually comes to about $110 after tip. Dece.   Wine by the ounce at $1 per. The white is a pinot grigio mix and it's fucking delicious for the price point.   Ricotta + bread + olive oil is a highlight appetizer item for sure. The pizzas are also good, but I like to try the other items on the menu because they are refreshed every number of weeks.   It's busy but never have had to wait longer than 15 minutes for a table."}
{"text":"Came here at 5pm on a weekday and it was already quite busy! No reservation needed at least. Atmosphere was super cozy and nice - perfect for a  cold evening. My friend commented that the upstairs is even better but it wasn't open when we were there. We shared the Brussels sprouts to start which were delicious. I think these would be enjoyed by anyone ! For my entree, I chose the pumpkin ravioli which was excellent - the right amount of decadence and the perfect portion size. The great thing about this place as well is you can choose the amount of ounces of wine you would like. Lastly, our server was great - attentive but also gave us enough space to chat and didn't make us feel rushed. Overall great time!"}
{"text":"The things that will bring me here again are the impeccable service and the awesome atmosphere. The place is gorgeous! The food was okay - we had the spinaci and the da dee? If you want delicious pizza - go to Terroni or Libretto."}
{"text":"Gusto's is an institution in Toronto, and now I understand why. It deserves all it's celebration because it just does everything right.   The wood fired oven can be smelled before you even reach the doors!  The pizza is fantastic, the salad is carefully crafted, and the dessert is tasty and authentic.   The fennel sausage pizza (Salsicce) was one of the best we've tasted, the Cavolo Nero salad really stood out nicely and the olive oil cake was he sweet surprise of the meal. It was fantastic and our new favorite.   Everything from the food to the drinks to the decor are carefully crafted with love. All this at a reasonable price has placed Gusto in my list of favorites in Toronto."}
{"text":"Nov 21, 2015  First off, this is an updated review from the previous one that I posted 2 weeks ago (you can read below).  After my first review, I was contacted by the restaurant. I was surprised but happy to see that they cared enough to contact me privately and asked to discuss my experience and how to they can make it better. She took a bad customer experience and helped change it to a positive one. In our correspondence, she was very attentive to my concerns and my questions.   I decided to go back two weeks later and my experience was completely different. It was fun, friendly and a very tasty experience. I brought my friend (who had a bday coming up) and when we got there, we sat at table that was comfortable and scenic. Our waiter Lucas was attentive and friendly. He came back to our table multiple times to make sure the food was good and our water was filled.   We ordered apps, a pizza and a pasta dish (wow) and desserts. Though the food hasn't changed, it was the customer service that brought it all home. Lucas, many thanks for turning my experience around. Because of the care from management, I had a very lovely time at Gusto. Thx ;)  4 stars!  ***  Previously...  Nov 7, 2015  Never again.  This was my 3rd time back and i only went back because I was \"invited\" back for a \"Dinner for two on us\". Little did I know it wasn't completely free and I had to deal with stinky attitude from my waitress, Rachel, all night. The second I handed her my \"dinner for two on us paper\" (that was generously offered to me) I was treated horribly -the times she came back to our table (2-3 times max). The one time she did come back to our table was to tell us \"all food is free... But you have to pay for tax & tip\". Let's see.... how much does $0 food cost on tax and tip? $0. If you're gonna invite someone back to give your restaurant another chance, make sure you actually treat them well. I'm also in customer service and I know that making your client happy (whether you fix the problem or not) stems from ones attitude.  This was our \"fun\" chance to try out their \"fancy plates\" and boy do I regret it. My friend ordered the 10oz steak. Meh! Unseasoned. I was fortunate that my Sea bass was crispy on the top and moist. But the portion was very little and too much seasoned lettuce.   I had come (first time) many years prior to this experience for a bachelorette party and I thought they had the best kale salad in the world that night (March 2013). When I went back this weekend, it was definitely not the same. It was very hard and too chewy. Also we were treated well - maybe that's due to the size and the money we spent there.  The worse part of our dinner was where we sat. We sat upstairs, and along the aisle. One of the floorpiece tiles was loose and anytime a person would walk by very quickly past us, it would lift and our table would move. The place got wayyyy too packed so we didn't bother (also since my waitress and others would ignore us). But by the end of the night, i was so pissed I just wanted to get out of there.  I've eaten at a lot of different places and I've got to say this has got to be the WORST SERVICE EVER at a downtown restaurant in Toronto. The only person who was decent was when we got to speak to the manager Ronny.   Even if you receive a free meal here, you should still be treated as a guest because you are. But I received more attitude here than I do with high school children (in private school). She did not want to serve us and she made that clear. She even fought me on the \"you will have to pay for the taxes and tip\".   Tell me, if you've read this far, would you have given them a tip?  I will never come back here again until the wait staff improve their customer skills quality. Don't ever treat a paying OR non-paying customer the way I was treated because I will spread this to all my friends and family.  I thank Kathleen for inviting me back because my last meal was not very tasty, but my \"invited\" return pass was 1 million times worst."}
{"text":"Gusto 101 is always rockin' a lively scene - whether in the summertime heat, or the winter tundra that is Toronto. Given that the place is tucked away behind King Street on Portland, it isn't a place you would typically be walking by - I think that reflects on their reputation and brand in a great way.  My date and I arrived late Saturday evening (~8PM). Knowing that they don't do reservations for the peak dining hours - I was expecting that we might be waiting around for a while. Low and behold - they had a table for 2 available! I was shocked.  We sat on the main level - on a table in the middle of the room. There was some pretty heavy foot traffic on the edge of our table - but it was still spacious enough that we weren't bothered during our meal. (It looked like their upstairs patio enclosed itself for the winter and there were people seated up there - but it could be my old eyes playing tricks on me too..)  Our Drinks: - Gusto Bianco ($1/oz Pinot Grigio) for her - Gusto Rosso ($1/oz Cab Sauv/Malbec blend) for me  I really enjoyed the Gusto Rosso off the bat. Cab Sauv and Malbec are my two favourite red wine varieties and the blend was very nice. Her Pinot Grigio was nice and crisp - but a little subdued on flavour. By the end of the evening, I think the Bianco got better - perhaps when paired into the food.  Our Food: - Fettuccine ai Funghi (Pasta) - Spinaci (Pizza)  The spinaci was okay - the pizza portion was pretty substantial. The dish was subtle in flavour - soft notes of the spinach, buffalo mozzarella and fresh ricotta. It was also a little tough to cut with fork/knife so we both ended up hand-holding our slices eventually.  The Fettuccine ai Funghi was pretty ahh-maay-zing! The medley of mushrooms (portobello, porcini, oyster mushrooms) along with the cream sauce with truffle paste was so savoury. The pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente as well. I definitely see why it is trending high on so many reviews here.  For dessert, we went for the Gelato - a caramel drizzle/vanilla gelato was their daily flavour. The caramel was very very sweet. A little too sweet and overpowering in our opinion.  I didn't seen an affogato on the dessert menu, but I'm sure they have the raw ingredients to make one, if asked. Might go for that next time - as neither of us really had a big sweet tooth.   I can't wait for the summer to return - I anticipate many evenings on the patio upstairs in the summer breeze."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service, the mushroom pasta is an absolute must try dish of the restaurant. And the house wine is a absolutely delicious and well priced at a dollar and ounce. The service here is impeccable and amazing. Can't say enough good things about the place"}
{"text":"Undercooked and cold. After reading amazing reviews about this place, and the server telling me all about their signature mushroom pasta dish, I was beyond disappointed. Would not eat here again."}
{"text":"The food was great but our waiter had a real attitude and ruined the evening for us.  We had to ask for condiments and our wine five times and waited  30 minutes before they showed up -- by then, our food was cold.  However, he was very quick with the bill.   don't need to go back for that. Try the place with yellow doors on king! $Bill"}
{"text":"One of my favorites spots in toronto. the Hale salad the truffle pasta and just about everything is great about this place. It's a must try."}
{"text":"Favourite Italian place.  As a vegetarian I get the Brussels sprouts and mushroom pasta. Amazing every time."}
{"text":"So I finally get to try that experience of eating in the dark that I hear all about. It's suppose to enhance the flavour experience. Wait, this isn't that place?! Then why in the world were the lights almost nonexistent?  Staff: I was with a large party of 11 and it was very difficult getting a reservation on a Sunday 4 weeks in advance. They said they were booked full for Christmas. After giving it one more shot a week before we got a reservation. When we got there I was surprised that the place wasn't full. There were two floors so space was definitely not an issue. Maybe they had cancellations? The waiter during our dinner was nice and took our orders in a timely manner. We didn't see much of him the rest of the night but we also didn't need anything else. They have a Nonna Menu for large parties but they were very accommodating and let us order a la carte so I appreciated that.  Ambience: It was very dimly lit. Many of us needed to pull out our phones for light while reading the menu. The seating and decor were nice. Remind me of industrial hard lofts I like.  Food: I had fries to start and it came with this aioli that I was not a fan of. I thought maybe it was just me so I asked my friends what they thought and the concensus was not good. It reminded me of wasabi and celery root but someone else said it tasted like olives. The fries were nice and soft. For my main I had the Polpette Pizza which was essentially a meatball pizza. The meatballs were good, but they were slightly dry which I've come to expect when I see meatballs on pizza. I liked the crust and it had a perfect thin layer of sauce so it wasn't too overwhelming.  I think I would've given it a slightly lower score but they were willing to let us order a la carte plus we had to change out number of guests a couple of times too and they were very helpful with that. They need to turn up the lights a little!"}
{"text":"Walked up on Saturday Night of Canada Day weekend, no reservations yet got an outside table within 5 minutes. Service was excellent, our waiter was very friendly and attentive. I had the flank steak salad and it was cooked perfectly rare like I asked. Girlfriend had mushroom pasta and was very pleased, she was unable to finish the huge portion. Never got any bread but our entrees and dessert was more than enough. Pricing was great, 2 entrees, shared trio dessert, and a bottle of prosecco all for $100 before tip. Very pleased and will return my next time in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I have been to Gusto 3 or 4 times now, good has always been very tasty and nicely presented. They show care in their work. The service also is quite good. Recommend the buffalo mozzarella, and the grilled octopus. Kale salad is my girlfriends favourite, very good but a little too sweet for me. Overall Gusto is a great place with consistently good food, highly recommend. Go check it out."}
{"text":"I came here on two occasions - one in winter and one in summer.   Winter experience:  It was...mind-blowing (at least the mushroom pasta was).  We ordered the mushroom pasta and a margherita pizza.  The pizza crust was a bit soggy, which I wasn't too impressed with but their mushroom pasta saved them and it was the best thing I had ever tasted.  Their house wine is also worth a try b/c it's quite cheap!   Summer experience:  I came here last week...really really excited to have their mushroom pasta again and this time, we were on a double date so we ordered a few more things.  We ordered this hugely talked about burger (hugely talked about by our server), the lamb pasta, and of course, the mushroom pasta.    As I took a bite of my mushroom pasta...I was so taken aback.  This time, it really lacked flavour.  Although a pasta that is supposed to be light in flavour, this one was bland.  The burger was also mediocre (their fries however were great) and their lamb pasta was just okay.   Overall, what changed from a great experience turned into a \"meh\" experience.  At least we were in good company.  I would like to give this place another chance another time...!"}
{"text":"I truly appreciate Gusto's atmosphere, decor and especially their patio in the summer.   Service is friendly and I have always been seated quickly even when the restaurant was extremely busy, which I appreciate.   I love their wine selection and they have delicious drinks. I am a little bit picky when it comes to cocktail and the bartenders made them exactly the way I wanted (I requested a few changes)   The food is good but I am not a big pasta lover therefore I had mostly appetizers. The kale salad is great and I had the cheese plate with it, which is awesome too. I just wish there was a few more vegetarian and lower carbs options on the menu but this is asking for a lot!"}
{"text":"I like this place because it has a rooftop patio and they have great food. The service is excellent and their house wine is cheap. We had a great time here as a group."}
{"text":"The food was really good. Loved the pasta. But my friend who went with me, she had hair in her food. GROSS!"}
{"text":"A começar pela comida, a variedade não é tanta, mas tudo que experimentei estava extremamente gostoso, muito bem preparado e somente com produtos de qualidade. A variedade de bebidas, principalmente vinhos, é realmente enorme. Mas confesso que não sou a pessoa certa para falar disso, não entendo nada. O atendimento deixou a desejar, os garçons são um pouco impacientes e demoram a vir atender na mesa. O ambiente é bom, clima gostoso, bonita a decoração e o lugar, mas não muito confortável pois é um pouco apertado demais, as mesas são muito perto. Vale a pena a experiência, recomendo, a comida é ótima!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and always enjoy myself!   The food here is great and reasonably priced. My favourite dish is the mafalde ai funghi which is truffle cream sauce mushroom pasta. I've had it a few times and haven't gotten sick of it! You also can't beat the $1 an ounce house white/red wine.   The vibe here is hip and lively. It's a bit loud and there is quite often a wait for seats. I don't think they take reservations for small parties so you will have to try your luck if you are coming with a small group."}
{"text":"Love the roof top patio, the service, the food and everything about it! It attracts a well-heeled twenties and thirties crowd and is particularly busy on the weekend. And for good reason."}
{"text":"I dined here with a few of my girl friends on a Thursday night. By 6:30pm the place was packed, and we were unable to obtain seats on the patio or upstairs. Nevertheless, we dined inside and enjoyed our experience overall.  We tried the pizza, the burger, and the salad with a side of steak. The service was quite slow that night, but understandable due to the amount of patrons. The only downside to the evening was that our meals did not arrive at the same time, we had to wait for additional condiments for our items (ie dressings, condiments for the burgers), and the noise level was quite high at the time.  Overall it was a vibrant atmosphere, a nice mix of customers, and pleasant customer service. I would definitely dine here again!"}
{"text":"I want to give this place 5 stars but the price point is so high for their lunch and they do try to rush people in and out; which can get very annoying.   Try to sit at the bar, come after work. Their grilled octopus is the best and their wine on tap is a great touch and a great way to stay on budget on king west.  Their brunch!!!!!    Still, great neighbourhood spot."}
{"text":"Let's talk about the ambiance. Exquisite! I used Yelp to locate a few restaurants that were relatively close to our area and Gusto received favorited reviews. Seeing as anything with \"truffle\" is fair game for consumption, I searched for a picture of their highly touted \"Mafalde ai Funghi\".   Let me be the first to tell you that the pictures do not do it justice. This delicate dish has to be absorbed to believe. The oyster mushrooms and truffle cream sauce is everything that you are imagining that it could possibly taste like (I picture you salivating at this very moment). I didn't manage to snag a picture of my dish because it wasn't around long enough to snag a picture; that good.   For my brunch enthusiasts, I recommend Gusto Sangria to perfectly accommodate your dish."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great ambiance/atmosphere, friendly service. I love how they have healthier options that are still so tasty! Great gelato, coffee, kale salad. Drinks were the only thing that were \"meh\", but the prices weren't too bad"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try Gusto for a while, but it seems pretty packed around dinner time. Weekend brunch however was blissfully quiet. My DC and I had our choice of tables inside (which we opted for, it was ~35 degrees!) or on the beautiful patio.   NB: The online reservations only have set times - 12pm for lunch or 6pm for dinner. However, if it's not busy, you can walk-in and try your luck at a different time. The bar area is really nice, so you can always have a drink while you wait for a table.   They have a pretty standard brunch menu. My DC and I were debating between brunch-y food vs. lunch-y food and our server recommended the best of both worlds, the Taglliata di Manzo which is a big salad with a grilled flank steak and poached egg. DC had that and it looked really fresh and the steak was nicely done. Although the frittata and the ricotta pancakes sounded amazing, I wanted to try their pasta. I was not disappointed with the fettuccine ai funghi. Homemade al dente noodles with a light cream sauce, truffle oil, portobello, oyster and porcini mushrooms. Absolutely divine! And the portion was quite big for lunch, so I ended up taking some home with me.   The ambiance is nice - bright (sky lights!), clean and modern with an open kitchen. Service was attentive and friendly. The server gave great recommendations and told us about their wine on tap that they sell for $1 per oz.! Definitely want to come back for that. They have a Pinot Grigio, Malbec, and Cabernet Sauvignon available on tap. They also have specials every day of the week: http://gusto101.squarespace.com/daily_specials/. I'll be back! But if you have been meaning to try it out and deterred by the crowds, definitely try their brunch."}
{"text":"The place looks cool and lively. You walk by it and you tell yourself I got to try this. The food however is barely ok. I ordered the fried risotto as appetizer which  was delightful. The spinach pizza for my main course hardly  qualified for eatable. I would opt for any frozen pizza if I had to choose. My girlfriend's pasta was average but far better than my food."}
{"text":"ambient environment. interesting interior design. quality food and drink at a fair price. except the chicken, which can help by a larger portion... meatball pizza is a must try!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food and staff. I've been here on dates and with friends, I've never seen anyone disappointed. I love the rooftop!"}
{"text":"We love this place!   Things to order here:  The kale salad is a must! (It's light and refreshing and most of all delicious! Even if you are not a salad person, you will be for this salad)  The mushroom truffle pasta is a must order. We never come here without ordering it!!  And for appetizer, if you are a seafood person, the squid is a great starter!"}
{"text":"Gusto 101 does it right and to perfection, it's as good as it'll get. I've been to Gusto 101 many times and have tried various items on their menu. Nothing new I ordered ever fails and it stays consistent with each visit. It's definitely not easy making reservations since everyone probably feels the same way about their food as I do. They're always booked out for dinner, so you'll need to book weeks in advance if you want some Gusto goodies. But I die for their pastas every time, it makes the wait forth it. The Mafalde ai Funghi ($17.50) is my drug, which has got those soft portobello mushrooms and truffle cream flavour. My friend orders it for the first time and goes \"That's it?\" Portion-wise she was fooled. The pastas are quite heavy dishes here which is why it was a smart idea to order just that. It left her eating just half before complaining how she's stuffed, unable to finish and didn't want the food to go to waste. A little goes a long way, but at least she'll now have really good tasting pasta for lunch the next day. I've also tried their Brussel Sprouts ($6.99), Cavolo Nero (known as Kale salad, $13.99) and Lobster Ravioli which are great in taste and texture, refreshing and are not too heavy in my opinion. The ambiance is great with rustic vibes and old euro-feels.  The food may be stellar, but the service definitely required improvements. Due to the high occupancy during the dinner hours, the waiter did keep us waiting to order our food and drinks. He kept zipping by us and we had to catch his attention 3 times. He rarely came over to ask us if we needed help which we did our entire dinner date. It was quite a bummer that the other staff members were unable to attend to us. They either simply forgot cause they were busy or didn't want to because we weren't their table of service."}
{"text":"The sitting area on the second floor is really spectacular - it is indoors while there is a lot of windows that make you feel like you're sitting outside. The servers says it is open year-round, so it must be even more spectacular in the winter when it is snowing outside!  Gusto 101 has a wine special where its $1 per oz, which makes a glass of wine very affordable and it complements any dish they have on their menu.  I had the linguine ai frutti di mare, whic is literally seafood linguine; it was tasty. The waiters and servers were also very friendly and helpful, definitely great customer service.   Overall, based on the excellent atmosphere and customer service, I would definitely recommend Gusto 101."}
{"text":"Gusto seems to be one of those restaurants that improve over time for me. I've been there about 6 times now - split between brunch and dinner and I've liked it more and more each time. When I first when it was only decent italian food, but since then the portions have gotten bigger and tastier and it's a reliable spot for pizza and pastas in the area at a reasonable price (less than $20 for the pizza and pasta dishes)  The patio is quite nice in the summer but super packed. Unfortunately they don't take reservations unless it's really early (e.g. 6pm) but if you walked in with just 2 people, there's usually a spot at the bar, even on a busy Saturday night. I've never had a problem getting a seat at brunch.  Things I like: fries, pizza, pasta and the frittata for brunch.  Service is generally good and without any attitude,  Space is rustic modern. I really liked what they did with the second floor. It's completely glassed in so it offers more seating capacity in any weather, while maintaining a sort of outdoor feel. I can't wait to try it in the summer when it's still sunny during dinnertime. It's also pretty cool how they integrated the skylights for the first floor into the second floor bar.  Overall, a reliable italian restaurant for King W area at a reasonable price and good sized portions and have become my go to spot for italian in the area."}
{"text":"I love Italian food and this place is bomb! First of all, the restaurant is super cute decor and  two patios (one outdoor on street level and another upstairs) along with indoor seating. Unfortunately we did not get to sit on the second floor patio as we were told it was open only at 6pm. However, my overall experience today was good. I've had Gusto 101 take-out before and loved the mushroom pasta. As my first time dining in, I couldn't resist not having the pasta fresh to the table so we ordered that along with the meatball pizza. The funghi pasta is cooked al dente and the truffle flavour is delicious. As for the pizza, it was thin crust with light tomato sauce /cheese and a good amount of meatballs on the pizza. I'm not a pizza fan normally but this was good! To compliment, we had the red wine sangria which I liked. Overall, I enjoyed my experience here and honestly it's not the cheapest place for Italian food but the food, service and atmosphere is worth it."}
{"text":"The mushroom linguine is AMAZING and I'm not the biggest fan of this noodle. I'm now a convert for this dish studded with truffle oil and in a beautiful cream sauce. Great for the fall and winter!  The wine list is extensive and the food simple but beyond very good well worth a trip to the King and Portland area. A must try as it will be added to one of your favorite spots to visit as often as you can!"}
{"text":"Definitely love the ambiance and a great place to sit and chat and have a few drinks and pick at food. The food was good, the dishes chosen were quite different, next time I am back in town I'd definitely have to come again and try other dishes that.l be recommended. Wasn't wow for the pizza it was super soggy. I'd have to say I've had better pasta but I love pasta so it really can't go wrong for me. I'll try again on my next trip back out"}
{"text":"This was my lunch stop for today. Met a longtime friend for a bite. Place was busy but not crazy busy. Had the Insalata a-Gusto with a side chicken breast. The salad was good but very small, too small for $13! The Chicken breast was cook well & very tasty. Service was what I'd call below standard. The waiter was slow & spent too much time with his eyes in a cell phone (they place orders like that). All-in-all it wasn't bad but I wouldn't go out of my way to go again. Too many Toronto Restaurant's."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I received a recommendation by our concierge at the Thompson to try Gusto 101. It was only a short walk away and there was immediate seating.   We had the pleasure of sitting out on the patio to enjoy the fresh air on a late summer evening.   It took about fifteen minutes before we saw a waiter but we were both hungry so we ordered right away.   They offer both their house white and red at a dollar an ounce. This is a must! Both options were delicious and the price was great!  We skipped appetizers knowing the pasta would be incredibly filling. But seeing the ceasar salads going out, we were sad to have not ordered one to share. They looked incredible!  I ordered the Mafalde ai Funghi which is a rich pasta in a creamy mushroom sauce. The portion was huge and while my tongue wanted to continue eating, my tummy only let me finish about half of it.   My boyfriend ordered the lasagna and it was so full of flavour! Again, a giant portion which he managed to gobble right up.  Apart from the long wait to order and long wait to pay for our bill, the service was friendly. The noise level was a little higher than we prefer but it might have just been because of a noisier than normal table seated right next to us.  Our meal only ended up costing about $60 and worth every penny!  If we are ever out this way again, I would definitely return and try more items on the menu!   -Ashley Marie"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and fantastic venue, however I just can't deal with the snobbery. Gusto only takes reservations online and at 2 particular times for lunch and dinner. If 50% of your party isn't there within 15 minutes of the reservations then your reservation is cancelled immediately and they don't even call the person who made the reservation. I get it, they're busy all the time and they really don't need a reservation system. Their reservation system really failed for an event that I hosted. There was a reservation time mix up and also a traffic delay due to a street blocked TIFF event.   Their food is good  but not amazing and the portion sizes were small. The server was not attentive and not happy with those who didn't order drinks with their meals. They also don't serve ketchup, even though they have fries as a side to their burger. Now, that's snobbery."}
{"text":"My good friend Precilla C. chose this restaurant for her birthday dinner and I'm so glad she did! We decided to share 3 dishes - prosciutto pizza ($16.95), mushroom pasta ($17.50) and arancini ($9.95).  The prosciutto pizza was my least favourite of the dishes. It was very cold when I got to it. It might be because it was the last thing I tried. However, I noticed that a lot of the cheese wasn't melted so I don't think it was piping hot to begin with. One thing I do like about the pizza was that it wasn't very oily at all.  The mushroom pasta was delicious! The pasta was al dente, the sauce was creamy and there was a lot of mushroom.  The arancini was good (not the best nor the worst I've ever had) but nonetheless, it was enjoyable. It was crispy on the outside and I wish a little bit more cheesy on the inside. For the price that it was, I wish that there was a third piece.  Overall, I think that this is an excellent restaurant and I can't wait to go back to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this place.   The place resembles an industrial warehouse more then a restaurant. The tables are stacked on top of each other, so it is very difficult to hear the person you are with when you can hear the people sitting at the table next to you.  All the dishes on the menu are in Italian, so I was very disappointed when I got frozen, out-of-the-box raviolis. If you are going to use the Italian names, you should use the freshest ingredients and made from scratch dishes (which is the \"definition\" of Italian food).  It tasted bland and wasn't what my girlfriend and I were hoping for. It reminded me of an Olive Garden. There are too many great places to eat in Toronto to go back."}
{"text":"Food is great, service was horrible.   The waitress gave some bullshit excuse of \"I just had to make sure your table was set up\" while she served another table beside us that was sat after us - I actually couldn't believe it."}
{"text":"Had the BEST experience here. 5 stars for food, staff, and drinks.  I was in town for a convention and was looking for a good spot for lunch. Man am I glad I came here. Sat at the bar and was greeted by Ian. This was the friendliest person I've met in Toronto. Followed his suggestions for  drinks and had the briscola and tresette. They were perfect.   Started off with the stake tartare and it was delicious! Perfect appetizer. Went with the mafalde ai funghi for my main course. The pasta and mushrooms were so good. 3 hours later and I'm still thinking about how good it tasted.   Shout out to Ian who kept me company and was a great bar tender. Had some good conversations and he was able to give me some pointers as to what places to check out in Toronto.  Thanks again Gusto 101!"}
{"text":"2 of us ate on the patio. We took all of the servers recommendations and it was all delicious! The fettuccine with mushrooms was super tasty! Their house wine was pretty tasty and $1 an ounce which was awesome."}
{"text":"Their mushroom fettuccine is amazing. Love the atmosphere of the restaurant but prepare for a long wait."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout and got the salsicce pizza, which had tomato, mozzarella, ground fennel sausage, and roasted peppers. This was pretty delicious! The pizza itself had a thin crust and each bite was crunchy, and the toppings were very flavourful and yummy. I liked that the pizza wasn't too heavy, and I didn't feel weighed down. I finished the whole pizza, which means I either cannot control myself or the pizza was on the smaller side (probs both) but I think the pizza can easily be finished by one person. My pizza was around $17.50 not including taxes. I had a bite of my colleague's pizza (she got the margarita pizza) and that was ok, I preferred my sausage one. Decent food and wouldn't mind coming back again to sit in the restaurant and eat there."}
{"text":"Gusto gets 3 stars because I like the place but if I'm just ranking for food, it deserves a 2. It's a lively, modern-rustic room with huge ceilings and tables that face the kitchen. It has a patio that is probably lovely in the summer and more seating upstairs. Our server was lovely, we practically invited her to sit with us for a glass of wine and the incredibly well dressed hostesses with their ipads had us seated in minutes.   But the food. We started with a simple standard - bocconcini salad with balsamic dressing and some bread. The balsamic wasn't very sweet and the salad was fine, nothing special. Our main was a pumpkin agnolotti in brown butter sage sauge that was frankly, terrible. The pasta was undercooked and the sauce tasted like it had several tablespoons of nutmeg in it, it was all you could taste. And the brown butter sage sauce was more burnt than browned. I expected a lot more from this place considering all the good reviews.  That said, our wine was DELICIOUS and I'm willing to go back and try again - everyone can have an off night in the kitchen. But maybe I'll wait for the patio weather and stick to drinks..."}
{"text":"I had very high expectations from this place however it was so disappointing that I felt the need to create a Yelp account just so I can write a review.   I ordered the Mafalde in Truffle cream due to the rave reviews here and the food arrived cold. Not room temperature but actually COLD. the paste was way too hard and honestly there really wasn't anything special about it.   My husband ordered a different kind of pasta (not sure which kind) and it was room temperature (so still not warm) and his dish did taste a little better but the pasta was really hard as well.   To accompany our dish we ordered the homemade bread which was cold and extremely hard.   The portion sizes are large so you will leave feeling full but what's the point if it doesn't taste good. Overall I would never come back here."}
{"text":"I don't think this restaurant would be my choice for brunch anytime soon. We were told we can not reserve table and the wait time was almost an hour. The employees where not very friendly and we felt rushed. We didn't like that the waiters upstairs (outside patio in summer) were wearing sunglasses. I think it's not really professional in hospitality industry. The restaurant was really loud, with very small tables and uncomfortable chairs. We ordered their popular kale salad, omelette dish and eggs Benedict. Kale salad  was really good but for $16 you get such a small portion. Too small in my opinion. But it was very good, no complaint there. My mushroom-spinach omelette was also small and oily. I have had similar omelette few days ago in different restaurant and it was bigger and better (La Select Bistro, restaurant not too far from Gusto). Potatoes in my plate were way too salty, I did not enjoy it.  This is definitely not a place I would like to come back. We also saw how the bartender was mixing up drinks - he used so little alcohol and so much juice, no thank you."}
{"text":"I am not sure Gusto101 is a good place to dine. My impression is they are coasting off their reputation and people go there because everyone else is going there ('fashion' district lol). For winebar atmosphere and just kicking back and talking over wine/cocktail with a bunch of friends Gusto101 works. I say that but it is also very noisy because everyone knows what I just wrote. Pizza is good only because it is thin crust but otherwise difficult to cut with a knife. Otherwise tasteless like Terroni Salads are not salads per se. They are full of ingredients that make you fat. Generally the food is lacklustre so go in the summer for the patio."}
{"text":"I still think about the meal I had at Gusto 101 at times! We sat at the patio on the top floor. The servers were so nice and attentive. I enjoyed my experience here a lot!  POLiPO: The grilled octopus was great. I just wish there was more of it. The sauce on the board was delicious as well.  MAFALDE AI FUNGI: OMG. The mushroom pasta is to DIE FOR. The truffle cream sauce was so good. I wanted to lick the plate clean. It was just a great dish, everything worked together and the pasta was good as well.  I had a great experience here and I wished that I known about this place sooner! I recommend this place to all of my friends!"}
{"text":"I just got back from a very pleasant evening at Gusto 101.  This place has been in my bookmarks list for a while, but I'm glad to say I finally made it there tonight.  Gusto 101 is located in a former auto body shop and they've really emphasized that motif here; the restaurant is replete with motorway signs and license plates on the walls, and oil cans and drums as garbage cans in the restroom.  My brother joined me this evening from out of town, and we were looking for a place to eat with a kitchen that stays open late.  I tried calling up to confirm this, unfortunately the reservation line closes at 6 PM.  Luckily we were able to walk in, and were reassured upon arriving at 10:40 PM that the regular menu was still available until 11 PM, but that they would then switch to the late night menu, so the kitchen would remain open late, yay!   My brother ordered the beef tartare, and was surprised at the relatively large size.  This isn't my area of expertise, I mention it to note that Gusto 101 offers good value for money spent.  I will point out that bread for the table costs $4, however that gives you quite a decent sized bag (made of washable paper!) of house made bread that is very filling.  I skipped the appetizer and went straight for my main: Mafalde ai Funghi.  I realize it looks a little small in the photo I took, but rest assured it was a very nice portion of delicious mushrooms and Mafalde pasta in a delicious truffle cream sauce.  I came away from it very satisfied.  My brother opted for the Sunday special (they offered it today on a Saturday because they're closed tomorrow for the Christmas holiday).  This was a lasagna with fennel sausage ragu, mushroom, tomato, and bechamel sauce with bacon.  If not for all the pork, I would have gone for this myself.  Again my brother remarked at how he was expecting a small portion, but instead he was treated to a plate full of delicious lasagna, and he couldn't even finish it!  On the drinks front I was a bit disappointed, because I ordered a sweet cocktail and asked to hold the lemon, but was told they couldn't customize anything.  I tried going for a different drink that didn't have lemon listed, unfortunately when I received it I discovered it too had a very noticeable citrus taste, which I dislike.  Luckily they were very understanding, and I was able to order another drink, this time opting for a straight bourbon that worked out quite well.  Finally on to dessert!  I went for the Pere, a dessert of local pears, brown butter, amaro, almonds, and white chocolate cream.  Wow!  I wasn't sure what to expect, but when I took a bite I was overcome by the sweet pears, the sweet cookie bits, and the delicious white chocolate!  Take a look at my photo to get a better idea.  I was really impressed by this dessert, so much so that I was tempted to get a second helping!  My brother went for the Bombolone, an Italian donut stuffed with Nutella crema, espresso, and cardamon, a perfect Sufganiya analogue for the Hanukkah season ;)   A note about the restroom, unfortunately signage is lacking in this department.  The restroom is located on the basement level, accessible via a staircase next to the front entrance.  It is unfortunately very easy to overlook it, and both myself and another patron were confused even after locating it because it's a single large room with alternating stalls marked \"M\" and \"W\", and a communal sink area with a single hand dryer (points for being a Dyson, though).   I really enjoyed my evening here, and I'm excited to visit again in the near future.  Thank you Gusto 101!"}
{"text":"Great date spot! Delicious Italian food and good wine - the mushroom pasta is really tasty and pizzas are all really good too.  Would recommend making reservations especially on weekends"}
{"text":"I went here last Thursday with a group of 11 for dinner. We had a reservation and were seated right away.   We had: - Kale salad: absolute delicious with a hint of sweetness to it. It didn't have a bitter or dull taste at all.  - Salmone alla brace: once again, perfectly made. I definitely recommend this.  - Polpette and spinaci pizzas: they're very thin but difficult to cut/chew because it was almost mushy. The taste doesn't even compare to pizza stores. I definitely wouldn't recommend getting pizza here.  - Pollo alla griglia: the seasoning for the chicken is amazing. Highly recommend.  - Mafalde ai funghi: if you like mushrooms, get it. The flavoring and consistency of the pasta are amazing.  - Tiramisu dessert: don't recommend at all. Tiramisu should have a slightly bitter taste but this tiramisu wasn't just slightly bitter--it just tasted awful. We ordered three of those for the entire table and not one of them were even half finished.   The major cons to this place are the atmosphere and service. We went on a Thursday and the place was so crowded and loud that we had to shout to have a conversation with each other. The service was also horrible. Our table's waitress never came by to check on us so when I wanted to order a drink, I asked a waitress that was waking by. All she said was \"I'm not your waitress\" and walked away. The service and loudness of the restaurant were so terrible that despite some of the good dishes, I would never return there."}
{"text":"Great food.  Service is overall odd.  The style of service has more of a \"I work at a bar\" vibe rather than restaurant.  People often ignore you at the door if the host isn't there, they \"throw\" drinks and food down on the table.  Not great re: ambiance.    The food however...is awesome.  The mushroom pasta... soooo good!  I always get that with a side of Brussels sprouts.  It keeps me going back despite the service.  I Definitely recommend it for the food, but with modified expectations of the service."}
{"text":"I had higher expectation going to Gusto, probably because I heard so many good things about this place.   Food was pretty good, but not the best. I ordered the funghi pizza and it was actually very salty. Although the risotto appetizer was amazing"}
{"text":"Loved my experience here! We got a spot on the gorgeous rooftop terrace and thankfully had a short wait to be seated (make a reservation!!!). We were ushered to the bar for a short wait where I got an aperol spritz which was fabulous.   The menu has fantastic vegetarian options but what really stands out is their mushroom pasta. 3 out of 5 of us at our table ended up ordering that because it just looked so tempting! We made the good choice - the pasta was fantastic and I would recommend it.   It's the perfect spot for a summer meal on the terrace and I would strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"*Love the ambiance and decor here.  *Excellent service, was really attentive.   -Prosciutto e Rucola  - $17.99  The pizza was scattered with a generous amount of arugula, which softens a little at the edges and lend a spicy bite that cuts through the salty prosciutto - delicious.   -Rigatoni Bolognese  - $19.99 The rigatoni bolognese at Gusto 101 was exactly what I always looked for in a bolognese, hearty and perfect for a cold winter day. A combination of lamb and pork along with the parmigiano creates layers of rich, meaty flavor. Each strain of noodle was evenly coated in a velvety smooth and rich sauce, and the salted ricotta added a welcomed salty edge to the dish  -Malfalde ai Funghi - $17.50  The portion was definitely small for the $18 price tag, however don't be fooled. The pasta was quite a heavy dish and I can assure that you will have a hard time finishing it!  I actually don't like portobello mushroom but oh boy, the malfalde ai funghi is officially my newest addiction. It was freakingly delicious and I literally have cravings for it on a regular basis. The cream sauce was rich and creamy, and I loved how the truffle wasn't too overpowering and enhanced the lovely earthiness of the mushrooms."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I received a recommendation to try this place on our side trip to Toronto. We were immediately recommended to try the kale salad - which was PERFECTION! In fact, we came back for to-go on the second night mainly for that salad! We enjoyed it with some wine from our wine tour and a beautiful view of the city from our terrace. We tried the burgers, which were also delicious!"}
{"text":"quality italian food! loved it here. would def need to return."}
{"text":"When I had the Mafalde ai Funghi, I couldn't stop thinking about it for weeks.  I thought I was the only one, but when I followed them on instagram, I learned this is probably their most popular dish!   Would definitely recommend, if for nothing else for that dish!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto! I usually prefer checking new places, but Gusto is just of my go-to's. Good food, service, drinks and vibe.   Favourites include Margherita pizza, Funghi pizza and Mafalde ai Funghi (pasta). Complimentary bread and $1 ounce wine are pretty damn awesome too. They also have an amazing sangria (best white sangria I've ever had!) and Caesar. I usually have a \"no one should order salad\" rule but at Gusto, I break this as their Cavolo Caesar is amazing! Good spot for brunch too. The dessert selection could be better, but just my opinion.  Never had bad service. I particularly appreciated that one time when I was ordering both a salad and pasta, the server recommended sharing the salad as she said it was a meal size (great advice and very true). Appreciated she didn't try up-selling but instead suggested downsizing.  I try to avoid busy times so best to go with a reservation or before prime dinner time if you can, or be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Lucky enough to get seating on a Saturday night! Initially told it would be 2 - 2 1/2 hour wait but got it after 10 minutes. Great vibe inside with comfortable seating and also has a beautiful patio. We ordered some mojitos (pretty good) and for appetizers ordered the Cavolo Nero which is a kale salad with pine nuts. Didn't taste bitter and was refreshing. For the main dishes we got the Ravioli alla Norma, Mafalde ai Funghi and the Regina Margherita pizza. The Ravioli alla Norma came with 6 ricotta and spinach ravioli pieces, served with tomato sauce and basil. It wasn't anything special and the tomato sauce tasted like it came from a can. The Mafalde ai Funghi was very rich and strong tasting with the truffle cream sauce and mushrooms. If you're not a fan of mushrooms don't get this since this dish tasted way too much of mushrooms. The pizza was pretty standard and enjoyed the fresh basil on top. For me this place is nice to come and get a drink and dessert to enjoy the atmosphere but food not so much."}
{"text":"Found the place at Yelp Nice place the roof top is great food is ok but the real problem was the server Mike K . When we arrive the table he came over with nasty attitute I did not say anything we ordered our drinks My son asked me why the waiter acting rude I told him don't worry about it than while he walking by the actually throw a brown bag on the table we opened the bag it was a bread I stopped him and asked him any olive oil? than he brought the olive oil I noticed other waiters serve the bread in the plate with olive oil. Than our food arrived we had no silver wear and napkin than I had to chase him for that , end of the night I paid the bill I gave his 15% tip and asked him why he was so rude his answer was he did not mean it kind of confirmed he was. Food was ok it was pricey for what we had and service was not good"}
{"text":"They have a nice menu and a lot of great flavours. Their mushroom truffle pasta is a staple for sure. Super rich though, I always prefer sharing that one. They have a kale salad that people go crazy for but I don't know what all the fuss is.  I really like the decor! Really interesting feel.  Service was great. Same owner as Chubby's"}
{"text":"Food was okay, but wasn't great. The ambiance on the roof top was great tho. A nice place to relax and talk with friends on a warm summer night."}
{"text":"Can you or for lunch this is my second time thought I would enjoy the patio honestly the place is extremely overrated limited menu limited wine list. Then you have to put up with a really poor service your attendance pull off and forget to bring your cutlery they won't change your plates the leaving forget to bring you a menu. I went up and up my own cutlery and then I went up and got my own menu. Honestly extremely overrated they need to clean up their act"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY !!!!! Dropped by here on a summer afternoon. The outside patio had at least 6 empty 2-seat tables. I was offered a table inside (only one table occupied inside). I politely asked if I could sit outside. I was coldly and robotically informed that this was a very busy restaurant, and their policy was not to seat singles outside. THERE WAS NOBODY THERE !!!! To repeat: there were 6 empty tables outside. It was anything but busy at that moment. What's worse is that I had stopped by once before and was told they would seat me outside but it would be a bit of a wait. I said I was pressed for time but would come back. The greeter said that \"sounds good\" Well, clearly this second greeter had different instructions. Going back here was a huge waste of my time. I immediately walked out in disgust. I cannot speak to the food here because the rudeness of the staff sent me packing before I could taste a bite. Avoid this place- nasty awful people with no class and no clue how to treat patrons."}
{"text":"Their beef tartare was amazing. For someone who's never had raw beef before, this dish deserved a standing ovation. Perfectly seasoned and everything on my plate seemed to complement each other.  I would definitely return but would make a mental note to grab a spot on the rooftop patio instead, since it's a lot (1) warmer (2) brighter (3) slightly quieter upstairs (it was SO LOUD downstairs)."}
{"text":"Hands down, favourite Italian restaurant in Toronto. You need to go here when their patio is open, the interior is to die for! If you have a large group of 9 or more, you'll need to do their family-style menus.  Must-haves: Carpaccio, Insalata Cavolo Nero (kale salad), Margherita Pizza, Rigatoni al Funghi *FAVE*."}
{"text":"Love it here! Food is authentic, very fresh and delicious.  Wood fired pizza is incredible and pasta melts in your mouth. Also love the kale salad! Fantastic ambience in the restaurant as well. If you want traditional Italian food this is the place for you!!"}
{"text":"Delicious Food- Kale salad is delicious also tried my friends fish with quinoa all A+ Great Service: Our waitress was friendly and offered excellent service Beautiful Ambiance: Sat upstairs corner table over looking patio, perfect view.   I will definitely go back when I am in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Updated review: So I have been to Gusto many times...Starting when the place first opened! I have had a lot of good experiences here!   The second to last time I was here I had a less than stellar experience. I wrote about it and the situation was remedied. I was invited to make a new reservation. We were seated and treated so well! We were upstairs and had a lovely view.   To begin with we were greeted by our favorite waiter Typhoon! (Excellent server!) And Lindsay was our waitress. We had our orders taken, and wine poured. We found the interactions with the serve staff great! Management went above and beyond to ensure our evening went well and our needs met.   Even after being open for a while (and menu shifts) the place still maintains quality service and sees to its clients concerns."}
{"text":"On my last night in town for TIFF I got to go to this restaurant. We ate upstairs, which has a really cool decor and ambiance.  We ordered the Ruccola salad, steak entrée and ravioli. We shared everything, also a great bottle of wine - Langhe Nebbiolo - which was fantastic. The quality of the food was really good and fresh. The ravioli was cooked perfectly... sometimes it's so overdone.  The only complaints I have:   The steak had a lot gristle in it and left good sized portions un-eatable :( The bread was subpar for an Italian restaurant.  But I'd definitely go back here when I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Great atmosphere made this visitor feel right at home. We enjoyed it so much we went twice while in Toronto. Nice and spacious but gets busy. We didn't have to wait too long before being seated though."}
{"text":"One of my favorite summer discoveries. Awesome pizza, tasty pastas, and wine sold by the ounce. Good looking staff and diners but all really fun, causal and with affordable prices.  The faint smell of the wood oven you get when sitting on the patio tops off the rustic feel. Being a car guy, I also love how the building is a converted garage, which is embraced by the decor.   The only thing is that the roof top patio is popular. It can get busy, so arrive early or make resos."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  I got the special that they had for Friday night (scallops) and the flavours were amazing, spinach, scallops, soft cheese, hummus etc. I can't explain it all but I am definitely coming back here for dinner again.  Price is a little hefty, but it's a good place to go for a special dinner"}
{"text":"Everytime I've been here the food has been consistently great. From pasta to salads to apps.   I've taken a few friends here and they've all loved it."}
{"text":"I just went with a group of 11 friends on the weekend. The seating was tight, but for them to get us a spot on a Saturday night at 8pm was awesome. I had the Cavalo Nero (Black Kale Salad) with a side of Polipo (Octopus). I initially asked for the Octopus as a separate dish and the server gave me the option to get it on the side with the Kale. I was very happy with that option as it was the perfect serving size for me. I tried a friends Mafalde ai Funghi and I wish I got my own dish. It was so rich and flavourful since you could taste the truffles, I will definitely get that dish next time! Hands down to our server who gave our group amazing service. I will go back again."}
{"text":"There are some restaurants along the king west district you just don't want to go to. Many are all about the glamour and very little in terms of quality and flavour. A little too shiny for my liking. And then there are a few gems that pop up in that district. A big welcome to Gusto - it's a simple menu - but they do it really well. My first time i had the pizza, which was exceptional. Another time, i tried the Gusto salad with steak, and i kid you not, i haven't had a salad that good in a long time. The interior is fun, but the seating is a little uncomfortable. But the patio upstairs is a welcome addition to Toronto's limited selection."}
{"text":"5 stars for the atmosphere. 4 for the food but overall one of the better pizza/pasta wine bars in Toronto.   In particular, love the bar and chefs table seating - really good vibe and great service if you sit there. As for the food, only got the mushroom pasta, which was good, but not great.   That said the selection of wine and ambiance more than made up for it."}
{"text":"The food and the atmosphere were amazing. Definitely worth visiting for amazing Italian and a modern rustic environment when in Toronto. Eric M was an amazing server, too!!"}
{"text":"Unreal food and set up of an old garage shop. Get the mushroom pasta and flatbread. If I lived in the area this would be a monthly visit."}
{"text":"ENVIRONMENT - awesome. Big fan of the decor.. Sort of an rustic hipster feel. I'm a sucker for strung lights so this decor did it for me. They have an upper floor thats kinda like a patio that can still be used in the winter via closing the windows (hard to explain). The bottom floor is nicely decorated as well and awesomely lit, and then a downstairs patio - it looked very romantic.  SERVICE - nothing bad to say, keep it up! Waiter helped my table take a group picture with and without flash, thanks for that! :)  FOOD - overall, not bad not bad. I recommend the Malfade ai Funghi because it's SO delicious mm mm. And cheap wines is always a plus!! $1 per oz, what more can i ask for :)  + Madalde ai Funghi $17 - it's mainly just diff types of mushrooms in the pasta but it tastes sooo good and flavourful! I think the truffle in the cream sauce was on point for this one. My friends commented on how good my dish smelled too.  + Gusto's BBQ chicken $22 - chicken was moist and not dry which was great. But overall nothing too special.  + 10oz Bistecca steak $33 - My friend got steak medium rare. Steak was cooked nicely  and tender. Not bad!  I'd come back again to come drink and hang with friends and order some apps! $1 per oz!!!"}
{"text":"I love Gusto!  Especially their mushroom truffle pasta which is their specialty!  The staff and management is great and ensure you have a positive experience.  This place is super busy too and the quality of their food justifies why people always go back.  They do take reservations at 6 if you want to go with a group and be guaranteed a table.  Anytime after 6 will be first come first serve."}
{"text":"Mushroom pasta was amazing for $18! Enough said. Definitely a place worth visiting for a special night out."}
{"text":"The Agnolotti di Zucca (butternut squash agnolotti, brown butter, sage, pumpkin seeds parmigiano) is dreadful. The agnolotti was fine but the \"brown butter\" was literally just melted butter poured over the pasta. So, so, so horrible. The Cavolo Nero Kale salad is quite good.  Been here twice, and the service is inconsistent. First time great, second time meh.   Note if you make a reservation online they'll sit you in the upstairs patio area, which is not as nice as the downstairs area."}
{"text":"Gusto isn't reinventing the wheel when it comes to good Italian food but they execute things well and at a good price. Gusto provides a more casual and inexpensive alternative to some of the other restaurants in the King West area, but doesn't sacrifice quality. The sauces are fresh and flavourful, the pastas are perfectly cooked and the pizzas are well-made and satifsying. The ambiance is slightly more casual and a little loud, but in a charming, vibrant sort of way. They have a good selection of wine, cocktails, beers and wine on tap, which is a nice option that brings back memories of Europe. If you're looking to stop for a decent plate of pasta in the city, this is a good contender."}
{"text":"Great experience.  Sat upstairs. Pete came to see our party of four, pretty quick.  Friendly and professional service. Caitlin (manager) stopped by to say hi. Nice touch.  Ambience - wicked awesome.   Loud, noisy, contained, energetic, lively. I loved it.  If you want quiet and subtle, NOT the place. People here are having fun.   Food - not what you expect from an Italian restaurant.  Way better. Different presentation, and food prep. Unique but wonderful.  We had the trout, the chicken and two steaks.  All were great!   Perfectly cooked, super blend of flavours, and presented with style.   Food was hot and juicy and delivered fast.    Not a rushed experience by any means. Pete was very good at taking care of us and made sure we had what we needed.  Timing was perfect for our group, and he was just the right amount friendly to make us comfortable.  Thanka for that, Pete.   Management : attentive, and very very nice.  Caitlin stopped by to chat  and it was very pleasant to have a manager stop by that is sincere.   Overall, wonderful spot, great food, superb service and an enjoyable night.  Thanks to your entire team!!"}
{"text":"First to review! Whoo Hoo!   This place is going to be one of the hottest spots in Toronto due to its tony location at Portland and Adelaide (just in front of Devil's Martini) and its rooftop patio.   VIBE  Total design porn here! Gusto 101 marks its territory in the industrial chic genre. Exposed brick, beams and pipes is what's it all about here. And they have the lighting down as well with cool lamps jettisoning (can't think of a better verb here) from the walls. Though it's a restaurant, on day one you can tell people like to hang near the bar.   The private room near the bathrooms is also super funky too. If you have a chance to peek in, it's quite fun.   There wasn't too much media hype about this place and the owners were secretive about its opening but that's how it will get buzz worthy.    And the bathrooms! The bathrooms are quite cool with sliding doors, pipes used as toilet roll holders, funky mirrors and a lovely porelain white communal sink. Oh, and I do believe the bathroom is uni sex.   Staff are young, cute and full of energy. Hello, Chris at the bar! But they do know their stuff.   WE ATE/DRANK We didn't eat. We drank! We had each one of the cocktails on the menu. Our bartender Chris said it goes from least boozy to most boozy from the top to the bottom. That is a lie! The price is a bit much for the size of the drink that you're getting.   Bocho -hendrick's gin, aperol, orange bitter cucumber - Yum. It's gin. I love gin. A bit sour.  Giuletta -plantacion barbados aged rum, vermouth, ampari --one sip= hi, I'm drunk. My least favourite drink. Super boozy but my friends loved it!  Vespino - stoli vodka, hibiscus syrup, mint --my FAVOURITE drink on the menu. Not a big enough glass. Lovely, sweet, summery. Love Love Love.  Lambretta - Woodford reserve bourbon, laxardo maraschino liquer, maple syrup, jalapeno chili - my second favourite drink on the menu. A good sweet drink. That chili really does give an amazing kick of an aftertaste. We were curious about this one!  Murcielago -jose cuervo tequila, absinthe, house made ginger beer, pineapple juice. -- a really interesting mix of flavours. I was nervous b/c I'm not a tequila fan and though you do taste a lot of tequila in this one the flavours of the ginger beer and absinthe (didn't know it was legal in TO) and pineapple make it fun. You also get candied ginger as a garnish. A fun one.   The food is all Italian  and the price points are a bit lower than at other places (but not that much lower) so I'm thinking they're going to be banking on volume. There are many pizzas, pastas and tapas to share. I'll be back for the food. And the kitchen looks wonderful.   This is a great date place or a place to have fun and flirt with the boys.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Lots of gusto at Gusto 101! Though it was only Day one, it was already busy but the staff seem to get everything under control here. There will be plenty of buzz about this place."}
{"text":"awesome food, nice service, but too popular! its hard to get a table, even when you have reservations. its noisy, so forget the intimate candlelit dinner for two in a hushed romantic setting. it would be all that if it weren't so busy! authentic garage loft conversion and authentic rustic italian food. go on a weeknight during a snow storm when its not so busy. :) kidding - its great, but make a reservation"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto! I always order the Mafalde ai Fung and house white wine (they do $1 / ounce!). The pizza is only average. But I like bringing my guests here for Toronto vibes. In the summer, they open the roof. At night, the dim lighting sets a nice ambience. The interior is very hip and trendy, and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Loved the patio and really enjoyed the $1 per ounce house wine. Both the red and white were tasty! I had the Pinot Grigio and my friend had the red which was a blend. Since it was $1 per ounce I got a 6 oz and then got another 6 later so it didn't get warm :)   The kale salad and pizza were delicious too. Definitely recommend coming here on a nice day.   Great spot for the summer and great service too."}
{"text":"Calamarata con Gamberi with Wild shrimp is one of my favourite things to order here. The location is prime and King St W is personally my favourite place in the Downtown core. The ambience both upstairs and downstairs is perfect for a night out and great for a romantic dinner for two or a night out with a group of friends. The first time I went was with my sisters family and my nephew who was 1 at the time. They made us feel welcomed and would say it's not the best place for kids, but you can pull it off based on the time you go."}
{"text":"the food and the patio are amazing.  the atmosphere is a bit snotty.  service suffers when it's busy.  personally, i wouldn't go when it's packed and it often is.  it just depends what you're looking for."}
{"text":"I finally visited Gusto - we had to endure the crowds & line-ups but we had a great table on the patio, the service was *fantastic* (save for the cranky girl working the ipad) and the food was quite good.   The staff were excellent at handling food allergies & odd dietary restrictions.  I will definitely visit again, although may keep my eye on the time so as not to hit it at rush hour."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and was seated on the roof top covered patio...it was nice and the sun was shining right on top of my head which is very refreshing in -20 degree weather!!! Ordered a kale salad with goat cheese and freshly squeezed glass of the yummiest pineapple juice on the King West side of town...was extremely pleased with the delicious food, prices, and ambiance. They are known for their fire wood pizzas gonna try that next time I am in this side of block :-))"}
{"text":"Love the Polipo  The service is always great Recommend Gusto  That's my review in Haiku ;-) Hope you liked it"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was a little trendy, but interesting.  A rustic italian garage look.  The food was interesting but not spectacular.  The wine special a dollar an ounce was nice.  All in all it was a great experience but just normal.  My friend found a hair in his past and the waiter tried to give us a discount because of the incident."}
{"text":"I've always liked Gusto, but I was disappointed with my most recent experience. Went on June 16th in the evening, sat on the upstairs patio. We were a table of 5, and to get drinks, appetizers, and our meals took over an hour and a half (no wonder the wait list is so long...). Food was cold, we were not offered parmesan cheese or pepper with our meals, waitress never checked on us, ordered a few bottles of pelligrino that never came, took half an hour to try and pay, etc.   The $1oz wine is a great deal, I think going forward I'll just stick with that."}
{"text":"Went there for our first date, the services are great!!! There's a pumpkin ravioli thing is really good!!! But the squid ink risotto was a bit salty, STILL TASTE REALLY GOOD!! Their house wine is great and cheap.  Great environment, and easy to get to. Definitely will go there again!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice for dinner in the last two or three months. First time it was good, second time it was just OK. Service good, space very cool, they are very good at pasta and cheese, but the sea bass, nope. I cant pin pount what was wrong, but maybe the whole thing just isnt right... It felt like my mom cooked it and dumped it over some veggie and be like, eat it this is good for you. The Chacuterie was OK. Pickled peper thingy was cute. What else did I order? Honestly cant remember. I start to have a feeling they only know how to do pasta."}
{"text":"Always great scene regardless of night.  Great place to bring visitors.  Best Kale Salad anywhere ( I never thought I'd ever rate a kale salad )   Grilled Octopus is incredible and mushroom pasta is delish."}
{"text":"O-V-E-R-R-A-T-E-D  I went in for dinner alone sat at the bar. \"Our grill isn't working we are told to push pasta.\" This is on a Friday night in Toronto. Grow up. Bartender had the personality of Suzanne Summers (google fake people) and the food is bad. 2 stars because if I give it 1 stars people will say this is just a jaded post. This isn't a jaded post.... that's a jaded restaurant. Don't go. . Buca is right across the street go there instead. You're welcome."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on a sat, got to the resto at 11:30am thinking it will be packed but to our relief, it wasn't.    We are regulars for dinner and didn't realize they served brunch on weekends so we decided to give it a shot. I like that their brunch menu is very unique but I didn't think the taste was anything to rave about.    I ordered the eggs in purgatorio which is 2 eggs baked inside tomatoes sauce with olives served with toast.  The olives were the only thing that had a taste to it, the rest of the dish was kinda bland. My husband ordered the uvoa camicia which is poached eggs with spinach and prosciutto on a crispy toast.  That was pretty tasty because of the prosciutto.   The price is fair and the servers are great so we will probably be back again to check out other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Gusto does not disappoint! We were seated on the rooftop and it was bright and airy. Between the three of us, we shared the mushroom pasta, grilled octopus (both must gets) and the spicy salami pizza. The house red and white wine is $1/ounce - perfect for happy hour drinks! The food is excellent, the service attentive and the entire dining experience highly enjoyable. Definitely one of my go to spots for the summer with the patio/rooftop now open!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar by myself on a nice Autumn night - the vibe was hard to beat.  Loved the energy and friendliness of the the staff/people around me.  Food was good, not great, but certainly strong enough to match the overall execution.  If I lived in Toronto this would be on a short list of places to go back to over and over."}
{"text":"I LOVE Gusto - I think its great value for the price and I love the ambiance. It's a great place to take people for any occasion whether it's a family event, girls night, or a date night. I am always happy with the food and find the quality consistent. The staff is always super friendly and accommodating. One piece of feedback though, is that the tables are way too close together, meaning you can hear every word of conversation of the table next to you"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and sat upstairs. The setting is very nice, its outside and the breeze is especially nice during the evenings. The second floor also can be covered in case of rains and extremely cold weathers I'm sure. They have 3 floors, 2 floors for eating areas.   Their menu is quite diverse and has a ton of options. I went with someone who was vegetarian and they had a few options to choose from. We had the bruschetta, the Calamarata con Gamberi (shrimp pasta), the Cavolfiori, and the tiramisu. The bruschetta was really good! It's made with mushrooms which I'm not used to, but was happy to have tried it. The shrimp pasta was really good! The portioning was a bit smaller then expected, but maybe I expected more because in the US they give you a ton. It did have a good amount of shrimp though which I really enjoyed.  The vegetarian dish (the Cavolfiori) was good too! It's a good option if you want to eat something light. And the tiramisu was really good too! I'm use to a cake, but I assume it was a deconstructed tiramisu. It did not disappoint! The service was also on point! I was really in the mood for Italian and am glad I came here.  Overall, I'd say it's a nice chill spot. Very hipster-ish. Great place to catch up with friends and whatnot."}
{"text":"Nice place in a great area. I got the Angus burger and it was about $17. The portion was just enough to get me full but the burger itself was just a tad bit boring. Definitely ask for a side of ketchup to put some sauce on it. Very nice presentation of the food though.   My friend got the mushroom pasta (I forgot the correct term for it) for $18 and they thought it was okay. I tried it and it tasted very mushroom-y, so if you like that definitely get it. Not my thing though. My other friend got the seafood linguine (again wrong title but the gist of it is there) for $18 and they enjoyed it.  A pitcher of sangria was around $42 and even if it did taste good, man that price was steep. Also pop is not refillable! They filled my friend's ice tea with alot of ice and barely had any drink. Just ask for no ice if you want it!   Staff is friendly and always around so that's a plus. They do give you complimentary bread for apps!   Wasn't a big hit in terms of food personally but we had a great dinner as a whole."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. I've been here multiple times, for family style dinner, lunch, brunch, regular dinner... Everything is pretty good!  Wine and cocktails are good.   The salad with drop peppers are really tasty. Something about those tomato-like teardrop-shaped peppers is delicious.   They are accommodating with food allergies.   Overall, this place is quite good and fairly-priced for the neighbourhood. I go here occasionally. Nice to sit on the patio in the summer."}
{"text":"MY GOD IS THIS PLACE LOUD!   Upon leaving the restaurant my throat felt as if I've been trying to win a debate battle at a nightclub for the past hour.  But then..  Undeniably delicious mushroom pasta (don't look for the name here, literally everyone on this page is talking about it, I'm sure you've seen it).  Best kale salad I've ever had with these yummy currant pieces.  $1/oz house wines!  Plus a charming bartender/server.  I...will definitely consider coming back."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Gusto 101, the food was great, the service was fast, and the atmosphere was great.   It has a feel good ambiance with feel good food.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner today and I have to admit that you guys have really good service and the food was awesome. I will definitely visit"}
{"text":"Consistently good (not great), and $1/ounce wine, how can you possibly go wrong?!   I've gone through most of their menu, and keep revisiting their:   - kale salad with pine nuts; - mushroom pasta; - spinach pizza; and, - several ounces of $1 wine.  I also really love their bread, polipo, rapini, fries, and all of their pizzas!  The restaurant is always packed, noisy, dim, and feels very trendy. The service is great, the prices are better, and the food is quite flavourful and pretty good.   I'm always happy to dine here, but manage your expectations - it's a fun atmosphere with well-priced food that's good - not great.  If there's a wait, you should definitely grab a cocktail across the street at spirit house!"}
{"text":".  Ambiance was excellent,- place is hopping with the hip and chic people. Food was amazing! Had Kale salad which is simply out of this world, Grilled chicken also good, spinach pizza- great too. The cod was excellent too and  presented beautifully but very very pricey. Water bottle on the table is a nice touch. Wine is served by the ounce which was great.  Service was very slow! Worse than that was the constant draft on our backs from an near by open door at the rearofthe restaurant  was an annoyance and distraction for a meal which was delicious and probably the most expensive I have ever had.  Told the hostess and all she could say is she cannot wait for summer!"}
{"text":"Ambience: 5/5 Love the vibe in here and it's not too loud to catch up with friends or date night.  Food: 5/5 (depending on what you order) - SABATO BISTECCA (FOR TWO) Saturday special is my all-time FAVE! Everything on the plate is amaaaazing - Beef Tartare is SO GOOD! - Mafalde ai Funghi pasta is another fave - Tuscan Fries (you know the fries are good when they're delicious even when the fries become cold) - Red sangria is soo sweet and delicious (single glass....the pitcher doesn't taste as good)  I'd skip the pizza"}
{"text":"I came here solely for the mafalde ai funghi pasta because my love for anything truffle oil-infused is real.   The pasta exceeded my expectations - so creamy, rich and full of that wonderful truffle oil flavour I crave on a regular basis.   Free bread before a main course is one of life's greatest joys (at least for me anyway), so it goes without saying I loved the fresh bread with oil here!   The only disappointment that accompanied my spectacular meal, was the lack of spectacular service. The waitress spoke to my friend and I in a condescending way and we felt VERY rushed out of the restaurant (when there were still plenty of seats open on a Monday night).  I will return to get my carb/truffle oil fix again, but hopefully I have a different waitress next time!"}
{"text":"I still dream about the food from this place. And $1 an ounce of wine? Perfect. Place is pretty cool, nice ambiance. The staff is... They're ok. As another yelper said, \"they feel too comfortable with their status, reputation and amount of people visiting them\"... They seem a bit snobish, and like they would only really take care of you if you look well dressed and big spender. Makes you wonder how they treat their different customers."}
{"text":"Good food, rushed service, quite loud.   We went with the popular choice of kale salad- great tasting kale, loved the dressing, & good opening to the meal (good to share between 2). Had the octopus, cooked to perfection. Good for 2 as well. The mushroom pasta, really great flavors, a must have. Overall really good food. However we felt extremely rushed the entire time we were there, the waiters started cleaning our table almost before we were done."}
{"text":"Came here with the family while on vacation.  Everything we had was very good with fresh ingredients.  The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was great.   I would recommend for a solid dinner!"}
{"text":"Met up with some friends visiting from the East Coast who were staying in the Entertainment District.  We wanted to get away from the touristy type restaurants and ended up at Gusto 101 on a hot, humid Sunday night.  We arrived around 8pm and were seated right away.  The restaurant was quite warm.  AC was sort of on but huge garage front door was open so it was probably escaping.  Restaurant was probably about 75% full but it did take a bit of a wait for our waitress to come by for drink orders.  When she did, we took advantage of the $1 wine by the oz and ordered 6 oz each of the red.    For mains, I went with the Spaghetti Chitarra allo Scoglio ($17.95).  My friend ordered the Salmone alla Brace ($21.95) and her daughter ordered Pollo al Mattone ($21.95).  The entrees came pretty quickly.  My seafood spaghetti was decent - a good combo of shrimps and scallops.  Pasta was slightly too al dente for me.  The chicken and salmon dishes were both enjoyed as well.  The $1 wine is decent, definitely drinkable.  I'm not really a wine snob so I liked it.  Dessert - I decided to have another 6 oz of wine while my friends each ordered the Caffe freddo al Gianduia ($5.50), a coffee mousse in a super tiny espresso cup and a small macaroon on the side.  They definitely wanted a larger portion size.  Service was okay aside from the longer wait at the beginning of the meal.  Felt a bit rushed at the end when our waitress brought us the bill while we each still had more than a half glass of wine left.  All in all, a good dinner in a hip setting for catching up.  I've been eyeing Gusto 101 for awhile now but never made it down because of their no dinner reservation policy.  I'd be tempted to go back again but on less busy nights with no wait times."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had! The grilled octopus, beef carpaccio and the grilled salmon were amazing."}
{"text":"I've been to Gusto twice now and have to say I totally love this place! As soon as my eyes locked with the cool facade and interior of Gusto, it was love at first sight..... uber, uber cool garage conversion, and super sexy on the inside. Rustic, industrial, cool atmosphere, fresh lookin' bread bar, cool open kitchen, and old garage peraphernalia as memorabilia.. . I was there for brunch on both occasions and would definitely go back (I'm itching to check it out for dinner, and I've heard some great reviews). I have to say it's up at the top of my list for favourite brunch spots in the city. Love the outdoor patio, haven't been to the rooftop patio but I'm itching to check it out. The space just IS cool...   I was totally in love with the menu, the funky rustic patterned coffee cups, the sweet little bread baskets brought to your table (made from cloth but look like crumpled paper bags). Everything about this place just screams fresh and quality on the inside. Totally a fan!   I can tend to be a creature of habit, so I did have the same thing both times for brunch (eek!), but I just couldn't help myself :)  I had the Taglliata di Manzo - a superly delicious grilled flank steak with a gorgeous side salad of arugula, grape tomatoes, salsa verde and shaved pecorino, and of course, to make it a perfect brunch fare, it's topped with a poached egg. Lemme just say I was FULL! The portion was super generous the first time around. The coffee was good, but on the lukewarm side of things. It's a good thing I was so distracted with the pretty coffee cups and cool decor..   Other fares had at the table were: Eggs in Purgatorio (mediocre rating by my friend; it was quite acidic and tomatoey from what I was told), the Fettuccine ai Funghi (WHO doesn't love truffles?! Hit ALL around), the Ricotta Pancakes (I was in love.. I was actually on the ecstatic side of the spectrum when my bestie couldn't finish them, so I got to take 'em home, and lemme just say, amazing blueberry compote and the lemon curd was divine).   The second time around our experience wasn't as great as the first time - our waiter was 'pretty' (trust me, he was great to look at!), but wasn't as with it as our first server. He missed a lot of things at our table (no bread or balsamic vinegar.. when he brought out my dish I noticed there was no pecorino on the salad which he told me there wasn't any in the dish, however it does say it on the menu and I'd had it the time before).. he also took forever with taking our orders when it wasn't busy at all (it was at about a 10th of the capacity of the first time I was there). So, not overly impressed with the service and we all had a feeling he thought he could get by on his good looks alone (although I'm not complaining at the eye candy lol). Granted, it was a long weekend, and he may have been pretty fresh on the floor... I'd still go back, definitely for dinner and I'm sure I'll be hitting it up for brunch again in the near future :)"}
{"text":"I've been to Gusto101 so many times and I love it here. No reservations after 6 so go early because there's long line ups at this place. Dinner gets incredibly busy!  I usually order their mushroom pasta. You can't go wrong with it and I'm pretty sure that everyone recommends it. On top of that, they have a killer kale salad, shrimp pasta, pizza and tiramisu. I find that their pasta is the best main dish you can order at Gusto101 so pizza isn't a must."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere there.  It's a cute place to go with a small group of friends. It was pretty busy though so I don't recommend for a large group of people (might not be able to sit together).  But the food was good and lots of choices for wines too."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to eat at in Toronto. I especially love their kale salad and pizza (and red wine on tap!)"}
{"text":"Truly a gem in the King West area. We've been meaning to try this place many times but it was always either they don't take reservation or the lineup was way too long. We were finally able to get a table on a rainy day without having to wait too long at the bar area. The food was really good, surprised by the price of everything consider that it's located at King West. Their house wine is soooo inexpensive... hello? $1 per ounce? Yes pleaseeee! We had the mushroom pasta... it was so well made, the pasta was very fresh and the sauce was really rich and hearty. Wasn't a huge fan of the octopus, but I can see how it's so popular on the menu.  I would recommend this place if you want some inexpensive wine and delicious pasta!  Ambiance: Chic, loud Food: 4.5/5 Service: 4/5"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered the Mafalde ai Fungi, a mushroom pasta back in January and I can tell you i have NOT stopped craving it since. The pricing here is too good! very inexpensive and quality service and food. If you find yourself here, make sure you try the pasta and make a reservation!! this place gets busy very very quickly!"}
{"text":"We came on Saturday thinking our reservations at 6 pm was going to be too early... we stepped in the restaurant to find the entire first floor was completely packed already.  People do say that this is a 'cozy' or a nice date night.  I wouldn't necessarily say that.  It's cozy cause the tables are close and there are shared table spaces upstairs.  It is a dimmed atmosphere but it's very loud... especially upstairs where you have lots of glass and metal surfaces.  I would say it's probably a good place for a girls or guys night out or a casual date night where you don't have to get to know the other person.  It's a definitely a loud, fun, and vibrant space with good food.    We were seated upstairs and it's quite a cool space... on the roof of the building, they built up a great glass enclosed 2nd story.  I really loved it as it had lots of light and interesting industrial fixtures.  Industrial hip vibe is a great way to explain the 2nd story.  The staff was really great as we never had a moment of an empty glass and they were always moving about quickly to take away finished plates.  We had a hard time deciding as there was a fair bit of interesting plates.    We decided to start with the octopus (this was well done.. tender with a good amount of crispy surface and char from being on the grill), salmon done medium (the fish itself was cooked really well... the broth and Asian greens wasn't so good.  It was overly salty and didn't add too much to the fish), with 2 vegetables sides of the sunchokes (great alternative to potato and loved the addition of the crispy bacon) and brussel sprouts (this is definitely one of the better versions we've had... crispy while still being tender and loved the peperoncini).  We ended the dinner with a tiramisu... I've had some great ones in Italy and though Gusto was good, it wasn't the best I've had.  Still a solid dessert choice.  Overall, this was a great meal with good service.  It was pretty fair price with it being around $85 including tip for 2. I'd definitely recommend coming here if you want to enjoy a good food in a place with a great vibe.  It definitely is challenging to hold a conversation but if you're among friends who are loud anyhow, it wouldn't matter!"}
{"text":"Decent Italian, lovely space and a surprisingly calm, quiet ambience. Made a reservation for 5 people during weekend lunch at 1pm, but it wasn't necessary since we passed the brunch rush. The main draw was the rooftop terrace, which we got all to ourselves - the back banquettes were a shaded, comfy spot even in 30º weather. Really liked the balance of industrial and upscale elements in the design of this former auto repair shop.  I ordered the Malfade ai Funghi ($18), which was intensely mushroom flavoured and worthy of its \"fan favourite\" status. The dish was a bit small but its richness made it filling enough. $1/ounce house wine was way better than expected. Staff were efficient, attentive, and pretty chill with us lingering over 2 hours. Overall it was a nice experience, definitely boosted by the relaxing atmosphere - it seemed different from its usual busy vibe but I prefer it this way."}
{"text":"This place serves tasty Italian food. What else do you need to know? :)  Seriously, this place is worth checking out. The vibe is cool. The waiters and waitresses are friendly. It feels upscale and trendy. Their food tastes GREAT. They have an awesome patio on the second floor, perfect for summer dates with a glass of wine.  You can't go wrong with Gusto. Their prices are on the upper end, but then again, it's King West, these guys have expensive rent to pay.  Definitely, check it out if you're craving Italian food or just wanna go out for drinks with friends. Either way, Gusto will hit the spot."}
{"text":"This is tough, because it wasn't as good as I remembered it to be. I came here for dinner probably 2 years ago and the food was great. At my most recent visit I came here for lunch and I got to say I was disappointed.  Beef Tartare ($15.50) Raw steak mixed with truffle ricotta cream and fig jam, topped with honey mushrooms. Served with crostini. This was probably my favorite dish for the night. It was really flavorful, loved how it was topped with the mushrooms. Really tasty.  Cavolo Nero ($14.99) Organic kale, currants and toasted pine nuts mixed in lemon vinaigrette topped with 2 shaved pieces of parmigano. The salad has a strong lemony flavor, all the ingredients complimented each other and was really tasty. Although I really liked the salad, the portion was a lot smaller than I remembered it to be. At that price, I got to say I don't think it was worth it.  Mafalde ai Funghi ($18.50) Portobello, porcini and oyster mushrooms pasta served in truffle cream sauce. The pasta was under-cooked. Texture wasn't soft and clearly slightly hard. I'm pretty sure I remember seeing actual pieces of mushrooms mixed into the pasta when I last had it - but this time, it was like shaved pieces of mushroom bits and no actual mushrooms. So much for a funghi pasta with lack of mushrooms. The only thing that maintained its standard was the truffle cream sauce, really rich and flavorful. However, my pasta didn't feel saucy enough. There was more oil on my plate than sauce.  Pricing of the food was more expensive than I remembered, and the portions seemed to have shrunk. I got to say I was really disappointed. I used to think Gusto 101's mafalde ai funghi was the best mushroom pasta I've ever had, but I don't think I can say that anymore. Service was good, but the quality of food just wasn't on point at my most recent visit..."}
{"text":"My friend highly recommended this place says it's the best Italian she's eaten but it's not. Food is just alright and options are limited. atmosphere is very loud and it's difficult to hear even if you're sitting across from each other. it's a good place if you feel lonely or you don't have much to say to the other person you're eating with. Tables are too small and tight, everyone is too close to each other.  Won't return here anytime soon."}
{"text":"We went here for a bachelorette and the place seemed promising considering it had a line, but we had a reservation. After looking over the menu and asking a few question, the guy serving us, who seemed like a manager perhaps, was a major jerk. With the menu being in part Italian, I was confirming the daily specials, which he responded in a condescending tone, like I should have known Italian. I ended up getting the mushroom pasta which was good, but I wouldn't go back for the attitude. I think there are plenty of other restaurants to go to which are much better, minus the attitude. After my friend was clarifying her bill and what the gratuity was, he said \"gratuity in the English language means 'tip'\". Wow douche bag...this was after he spent 10 minutes trying to calculate our bills separately on his iPod."}
{"text":"Gusto is my go-to spot in the city! For this visit, I came for brunch. We sat on top of the restaurant in their gorgeous glass covered patio but their also was seating inside and outside in front of restaurant.  I was debating if I should order from their brunch menu or the regular but I decided to go with my gut and have my all-time favourite pasta in the city - their Fungi pasta. It is so delicious, it makes my mouth water every time. It is perfectly creamy but not too creamy, with the truffle flavours exploding in your mouth....mmm it's the best!  The rest of my group ordered  1. Eggs in Purgatorio - which were eggs baked with spicy tomatoes and kalamata olives and comes with fresh bread to dip in. They loved it 2. Spinach Omelet - standard omelette with spinach and ricotta cheese. My friend's came a little undercooked and runny but they rushed it back in and within minutes they brought out a new one.  3. Tiramisu - they gave us a free dessert for the runny eggs and I have to say this was one of the best tiramisus I have ever tried!  It wasn't nearly as busy at brunch vs. dinner time when you have to wait an hour for your name to be called, so I would for sure check out this spot for brunch. I wish they took reservations! But that pasta is worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Incredible Italian food for the price point. Every bite was delicious. Even my bf who is a picky eater loved the kale salad that we shared as an appy. The truffled mushroom pasta is heavy on the truffle flavor and the pasta is Al dente and taste freshly made.   Ask to be seated on the second floor in the summer and enjoy the sunshine:) !!"}
{"text":"Mafaldi ai Funghi. Yes. The best. (For those craving for heavy, creamy, mushroom pasta)  Their starter breads are warm and delicious. Veggie dishes are yummy as well. Interior is nice. A little crowded, they need to expand for more room. If you want to feel like you're downtown eating some good Italian this is the place. (Just get the mushroom pasta and you're good....)"}
{"text":"This is probably too loud restaurant I've been. Omg. I just couldn't finish my food because of noise. If you're on a date or hangout by yourself, don't even try to come."}
{"text":"I've only been to Gusto for brunch, and I love this place.  The food is nice, and the ambiance is fantastic.  First of all, I must say that the space is very attractive. It has feel of a converted garage. It's open and airy, with a big open kitchen. It has lots of nice rustic accents.   The place is quite big, and so you can always get a spot even for a weekend brunch. This is a breath of fresh air in a city like Toronto, where it seems that standing in line for a brunch is the norm. If you're like me, then standing in line for a brunch is not your favorite way to start the weekend. In fact, being vertical is my least favorite position on a weekend morning, especially after a night of drinking. At Gusto they always seat you down promptly and get your order going right away.  The food is pretty good. The kale salad is Cavolo Nero (kale salad) is a must. I never knew kale could taste so good. They have the standard brunch fare, like frittata and omelette. But they also have a large selection of tasty pizza and pasta.  While here, you should stroll around the restaurant and check out the nice rooftop patio, the private dining room downstairs which looks like a cellar, and the washroom with co-ed sinks! Watch people do a double take, as they think they entered the wrong washroom."}
{"text":"I ordered an overly rich truffle house made pasta, a nice red wine recommended by the waitress who was quite helpful, and my fiancé had a burnt pizza we should have sent back.  My fiends loved their kale Caesar salads and roasted veggie options. I found it over priced but I sat on the rooftop patio so for that I understand why it's so popular. Old warehouse style building transformed into a restaurant with a partially open patio rooftop with glass ceiling so you're covered in the rain. Not ground breaking but nice atmosphere. Would go back for a drink and an app maybe."}
{"text":"My go to spot in King West. Such a great casual vibe while the food is delicious and reasonably priced. Pizza, pasta, steak, seafood........whatever you order is solid. Great patio space and the rooftop with a retractable roof is also pretty cool. I have been dozens of times and the food has always been on point. I have noticed the service has gone downhill though. My server Nick a couple of weeks ago was the worst waiter I have had in my life - uninterested, busy chatting with bartenders/staff and was extremely rude. After asking him three times for a cocktail, I ended going up to the bar to order/get it myself. When I pointed it out to him he literally screamed at me - \"I can't control how fast the bar makes drinks!\" I was having a late lunch and the restaurant was not even busy, I just watched him float around. Can't blame the resto for hiring one dud as it can't be easy to work there as it is always slammed."}
{"text":"Gusto 101 has a rustic and lively vibe along with a quieter upstairs for those who prefer a more intimate setting.   Starting with appetizers, the Tuscan Fries ($7) were solid choice to munch on with or without the garlic aioli. The Mozzarella di Bufala ($19) was an okay dish but the cheese-to-accompaniments ratio was off; ended up having to eat cold mozzarella by itself.   Onto their pastas, their most popular Mafalde ai Funghi ($19) had a creamy sauce that was delicious and comforting but the Bucatini con Sugo di Vitello ($20) was quite bland. Overall, I found both pastas to be too al dente for my taste.  For drinks, they offer a house red or white wine for $1 per ounce! I had the Gusto Rosso, which tastes like you would expect from a wine on tap.   Despite the hype, I found the menu quite hit or miss. So don't expect to be blown away, but it is a good option for a laidback night of wine and Italian fare that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Second time for me trying Gusto 101. Food is amazing very good place for large groups or small groups."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, the roof top patio is great for hanging out either night time or fall, spring. The food is ok. I got the meatball pizza, it lacks toppings and the base is made thin so the base soften by the end of the meal. The meatball wasn't that good, nothing special. I mean I'll come for the patio and the bar but not likely for the food."}
{"text":"My husband and I and 16 delighted guests went to Gusto 101 for our small wedding lunch celebrations. I had never actually eaten here but it was listed in the Top 10 Private dining restaurants and I was surprised I was able to book the private room a few weeks before the date. The bookings manager was very friendly and accommodating, the process was very smooth in booking and choosing the menu for our event, the security bond for the venue was so great compared to other venues with exorbitant fees . We were greeted by our lead waitress, the wine cellar was very classy with a beautiful rustic feel and intimate seating. Perfect for our party, can fit a maximum of 20 people. They are also very very accommodating with people with many serious food allergies.  Now let's talk about the food, oh my, just divine Italian food. We choose the set Nonna lunch menu B, with delicious shared cheesy arancini balls, carpaccio and surprisingly friend making kale salad. We then all chose our second meal, I had the creamy oyster mushroom and truffle with fettucine. There was also a vegetarian pizza and grilled flank steak to choose from. Sipping on some lovely wine, and coffee and tea to end the day.  I highly recommend this place, it's a great atmosphere, high quality of food and great service!"}
{"text":"I've been to Gusto 101 twice already for dinner. i HIGHLY recommend the mafalde ai funghi (mushroom pasta). It is SO damn good, first time i had it i almost passed out because it was SO good. The second time was just as good. Other things I also recommend  is the polipo (grilled octopus), although it's on the bit burned side, the texture is just so good, along with the sauces and potato on the side. It's a great dish. I read on a review here that the kale salad is \"better than sex\", so I had to try that too- I thought it was pretty amazing. Definitely very different.  Steak tartar was also good, and the meatball pasta was also so delicious. The service was solid and consistently good both times I went.  I suggest you make reservations, they only have 6pm time slots if you want to make reservations but I didn't mind it at all. Would totally come back. This restaurant has become one of my fave restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place gets packed! Make sure to have a friend put their name down as they don't take reservations. Dimly lit, great place to catch up with friends. We split the beef tartar (good) and brussel sprouts (so-so, very tangy/sweet saucy). I got the kale Caesar salad. Honestly the salad was so crispy and too tangy for my liking. I wish I ordered a pasta dish so that I could balance out the tanginess with some savoury Unami on my palette. That house bread though - so tasty, ask for some balsamic vinegar to go with it."}
{"text":"Really cool/ western Italian restaurant. Got the steak and my friend got the pasta with the garlic cream sauce (or truffle sauce) I don't recall the name. I tried a bit of her pasta and it was so good; I'd probably get that dish next time I come here. The steak was also really tasty. The service was quick with our orders and served our food in a timely manner. And they were also very friendly.   There's a place to sit by the patio, indoors and a rooftop patio (which is available at 6pm the time we went)."}
{"text":"First time coming here for brunch. Rustic atmosphere, great service, and deliciously-flavoured food.   I got the Omelette ($12.99), awesome! All the ingredients taste fresh and I can feel they took the extra effort to making each dish. Purple kale as side were delicious as well, topped with artichoke vinaigrette. The potatoes were not crispy as described though.   My partner ordered the Uova in Camicia ($13.50). It's basically eggs bennedict with mortadella on focaccia. This was extra unique from their choice of ingredients!   I would definitely come back again to try out their dinner menu. Thank you staff for the lovely meal."}
{"text":"I come here so much its kind of sad.   The patio is beautiful and I love the atmosphere. It's always upbeat, fun, and relaxed. I come here when I want fresh, quality, comfort food and it never disappoints!   I always get the kale salad to start and their salmon is always cooked to the exact medium-rare that all salmon should be cooked to so I highly recommend that as well.   I've had a few of their pastas and they were all good, carpaccio is amazing, octopus is delicious. The chicken was only average though, but aside from that everything on the menu is great and you will not be disappointed.   Drinks are good - no complaints here. The only time I had a friend point out that her gin and tonic wasn't strong enough (it really wasn't, not sure what happened there...) the waitress quickly offered to replace it. Service is always prompt and friendly.    The only downside to this place is it gets busy and full so quickly. Make sure you have a reservation in the evening so you're not waiting."}
{"text":"Gusto is always reliable and great. I go frequently.  But, last night, I was disappointed. It was...merely average.  The staff were all still great.  However, the portion sizes of dishes I'm used to ordering had shrunk by 50%.  Gigantic lamb meatballs, accompanied by lots of great tomato sauce, were replaced by smaller appetizer-sized ones, in a decorative amount of sauce.  Buffalo mozzarella was usually a huge mount of cheese surrounded by lots of tomatoes. This time? Five small bite-sized portions, with a handful of mini tomatoes.  I raised my concerns with the manager- who offered us complimentary drinks. I declined. My concern wasn't being compensated, but was hoping it was just a one off misstep because I otherwise love coming here."}
{"text":"Any place that has $1 per oz wine, I will be a huge fan. The beef Carpaccio was pretty salty. Pizze Funghi  was good enough. I enjoyed the atmosphere. It's a cool space and good for a group of friends to go hang out and eat. I don't know about a date because its pretty loud in there - and that was on a Monday. Worth checking out for sure."}
{"text":"I never thought I would love a pasta that had no meat or seafood in it, but the Mafalde ai Funghi mushroom pasta is amazing! It is a simple dish with portobello, porcini, and oyster mushrooms. The truffle cream sauce is really good and the pasta was very fresh and al dente. The decor and ambiance of this restaurant are also very nice. They also have decent house wine for $1 per ounce."}
{"text":"First time coming to Toronto and my friends friend recommended this place. It was good and different. We got there on a Saturday at 6pm. No line, no wait. But man after we sat down, by 7-8pm there was a long line! The servers are very friendly and the food was good. I'm not a wine drinker but I did get the wine by the Oz. They charged 1$ per Oz for their house wine!"}
{"text":"What a great place! really good atmosphere, friendly servers, and delicious food. relaxed vibe, focus is on the quality of food, without a high price tage. we enjoyed teh good wine choices too. A lot of wines available in Canada are much too sweet fo rmy palate but htey actually had some good dry options here.  there's a busy indoor room, with hgh ceilings and open kitchen. as well, there's a small terrace at the front which catches the sun on a good day."}
{"text":"This place gets really packed so make a reservation! We came here for dinner on a Saturday and as it was too cold that day we were seated on the first floor. Fun atmosphere, smiling servers, tons of chatter. We started of with their kale salad (i forgot the actual name) and contrary to how it looked it was delicious! Did not expect those flavors. We really enjoyed it. For the main I had the burger and fries. I love burgers so I always have to try the buger in every restaurant I go to. Gusto's burger was excellent. Perfect balance of everything. Not as big as I hoped but I was pretty satisfied. The fries were meh. I should have just had another burger as the side. Haha We had the tiramisu for dessert and although it was good it was nothing out of the ordinary. All in all I would go back to sample the other items on the menu and hopefully be able to check out their much talked about patio."}
{"text":"MMM mmm mmm I think I have found my new favourite Italian place in the city! Gusto 101 is an awesome place to come in the summer time, because they have a patio out front as well as one on the second floor. Two friends and I sat on the front patio, and it was an absolutely lovely experience. Our servers were very friendly, and accomodating when we requested to pull up an extra chair for my friend who joined late. The food is delicious as well, and on my first visit here I had the pleasure of trying the Cavolo Nero (kale salad with currants, toasted pine nuts, parmigiano and lemon vinaigrette), Polipo (grilled octopus), and Mafalde ai Funghi (mushroom pasta.)  Cavalo Nero ($13.99): So many people mentioned this dish in their reviews, so I had to try it because I generally do like kale. The salad was very good, it was a fairly large portion and was flavourful - a little bit of sweetness/tartness from the currants, zestiness from the lemon vinagrette, crunch from the pine nuts, and a great savoury flavour from the cheese. That being said, it wasn't a standout dish for me, it was just a kale salad, albeit quite a good one. I thought it was comparable to the kale salad I had once at Moxie's though, and maybe even remembered enjoying that other one a bit more.  Polipo ($15.99): This dish I loved, but really wished they would have given us more, especially given the price. The plate really only came with two tentacles, although one of them was a lot larger than the other and could be split into three sizeable pieces. The octopus was grilled to perfection though, and was soft rather than the chewy, rubbery texture I'm used to. It was also wonderfully seasoned, and came with chimichurri and olive tapenade, as well as piquillo puree lemon potatos and fried capers on the side. Everything blended together well to make an absolutely delicious dish - I could have eaten so much more of this.  Mafalde ai Funghi ($17.50): I didn't know what to expect from this dish, but ordered it after reading Yelp reviews. Who would have guessed that a dish consisting mostly of mushrooms (and no meat) could taste so good?! First off, the mafalde is a really interesting type of pasta which I don't see around often. They are like long and noodley but also kind of thicker... but anyways the texture of it was the perfect amount of chewiness for me, and the truffle cream sauce was just so good. I can't even wrap my head around it because this dish seems so simple, but really it was fantastic, would highly recommend ordering this!   I definitely want to return to Gusto 101 in the future! The food I had was fabulous and left me wanting more, the service was good, the patio was fun and lively and upbeat, and their $1 per oz. wine deal is genius and should be implemented in all restaurants around the city! Makes drinking very affordable, as you can pick however much house red or white wine you want (I got 5 oz. of white for $5.) The only complaint I would have is that it's just not enough food for the price - I literally finished my pasta in about 5 minutes and then wanted a second (or third.... or fourth...) plate."}
{"text":"Great food, ambience is awesome.  Finally went for first time with a bunch of friends.  Be prepared to wait as they don't take reservations.  Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Love this resto - great date spot! Trendy restaurant with amazing , authentic Italian food. They have a ground level patio and a rooftop patio (retractable rooftop for colder season). I've been here a few times and it never disappoints. Last night we had the Margherita pizza, bolognese pasta and  mozzarella do bufalo. The food was delicious, good portions. It is on the pricier side, but it is considered a fine dining restaurant. They have a very expansive wine list, for those that enjoy the vino. Service is decent but not over the top.  If you have not been, you must experience it at least once!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times before and always find myself coming back for the yummy food, excellent decor, and phenomenal service. Today however wasn't what I remembered. The service was mediocre to say the least and when we asked about the very small amount of ($7) fries that were delivered the server said that is the size of them, then quickly dashed away. We have both ordered them before and the Instagram pictures all say differently, but not much of complainers we just carried on.   The situation should have been handled differently. And once the food was dropped it felt like we were being ushered out, there just seemed to always be a check up, a reason to walk over and move things around. I think our sever came over around 10 times the course of the meal which made me feel rather uncomfortable. As the end very quickly progressed she was so eager to drop the bills without looking them over then disappeared. Again another point lost.   Overall the ambiance and food is fantastic! I just wouldn't come back here for a friendly catch up or a date."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Gusto 101's upstairs patio twice in the summer. They have a killer red sangria, and the prosciutto pizza was amazing. Went with a group of 6... They wouldn't take reservations for the time we were going, so we put our names down, ran around the corner to home of the brave for a couple drinks and before we knew it we had a table. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant. Every time I've been there I have chosen different items and every time it was better than the last. Their house wine is also delicious and refreshing. The servers are polite and prompt. It is a bit pricey but very worth it. If you go on a nice summer day, the roof top opens and it is just the most relaxing, beautiful experience."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about the service. The hostess offered to carry my luggage upstairs. Needless to say I cordially declined her kind gesture. The waitresses, who were very cute I might add, were on top of their game!  They have a covered roof top dining room that overlooks the street and is brightly lit with sunlight. It was neat, a pleasant atmosphere to have brunch.  I ordered the eggs in purgatory, which came with an Italian spin on them. I quite enjoyed the simple, yet fresh, Italian ingredients. Not a bad spot for Sunday morning and it was about 20 minutes walking to Billy Bishop Airport."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is very well laid out. The patio on the second floor gets plenty of sunlight in the summer. However the service is nothing to write home about. The food takes forever to come. I've been here on more than one occasion and everytime there was close to an hour wait for each order. The staff has an air of pretentiousness which doesn't suit that kind of establishment. I don't think the portions or the quality of the food do justice to the heftier prices. There's no reason to have to wait close to an hour for cold cuts or rizoto."}
{"text":"The food honestly did not meet my expectation since it was so highly rated on yelp. When we got there it was a 30-40 minute wait...the place was crowded and they had nowhere for you to stand without feeling you were in the way. We expected there to be multiple options for pasta but there wasn't very many. I ordered the meatball pizza which was plain, didn't come out hot and was a little too salty. I'm pretty sure the meatballs were pork but it didn't clarify whether they were beef or pork. My friend got the mushroom pasta which was honestly really good it just came out a little cold. The waitress wasn't that kind and wasn't very attentive to our table. My friend ordered the moscato which was 10$ and came in a champagne glass which I think was extremely overpriced for the size considering you can get a small bottle of moscato for that price. In conclusion I think this restaurant was of average quality and was way too overpriced."}
{"text":"Gusto 101 was really disappointing! :( we went on a friday night & the wait was an hour and a half, so we felt like it was going to be amaaazing. The atmosphere and aesthetic of the restaurant were great! The perfect summer vibe. However, the food was not good :(. Overpriced & undercooked pasta. We had to ask them to remake on pasta because it was waaay too salty. It came back just as salty so we just set it aside. :( the brussel sprouts were okay, the funghi pasta was okay (they went overboard with the truffle oil, as most restaurants do). The best dish was the simple prosciutto & arugula pizza.   Tldr: vibe & atmosphere over food"}
{"text":"Good ambiance The ground floor was busy so we were proposed the 2nd floor. There it's actually even better. You can enjoy the large window roof.  The burger was not too big, maybe a bit small for a man. I took the antipasti risotto. It is a risotto served in a ball shaped. Really good.  Only negative point : it is too loud !"}
{"text":"Really like the open roof bar. Sooo enjoy my brunch there with my friends. The salads with chicken breast is amazing?will try other dishes next time. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Been a few times over the past year. Mafalde is definitely the best dish on the menu. Service on Thursday lunch was subpar. Waiter was difficult to call over for napkins and bread so my husband had to get up to request the items. Found a piece of tin foil and a hair in my Mafalde and nothing was done about it. If not for service I would rate 5 stars."}
{"text":"Came here before for dinner and the truffle pasta was good, but came back again for brunch and was disappointed. I ordered the eggs in purgatory (is that what its called?!? Kinda forgot...). There was nothing wrong with it but was just kind of boring.. I guess I expected more since this place has a lot of good reviews. Would be back for the pasta/pizza but probs not for the brunch."}
{"text":"Really good food consistently. I go for the kale and add some steak to it - phenomenal. Just beware that if you're sitting n the upper level it gets very very hot and very loud at busy times."}
{"text":"Really neat repurposing of an old space. We ate on the rooftop deck and enjoyed the fresh air. We shared a salad, pizza, and branzino and all 3 were delicious. The food brought to the tables around us looked equally appetizing. Service was slightly slow, but the food was well worth the wait. We do encourage you to order drink refills whenever  your server comes by. This restaurant is located in a neat area with lots of other bars and restaurants around. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. I originally went when they first opened, several years ago. I have returned many times over the years, the most recent being last month. I have never had a bad meal and have tried almost everything on the menu. Everything is well cooked, flavourful and presented nicely. The house wine is sold by the ounce, an affordable add on. I love the top enclosed deck, which is not open until 6 pm. A must to add to your list."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 Atmosphere: 5/5 Service: 5/5  Have been to Gusto many times over the years and the food has always been great, the service has been outstanding, and the patio...omg the patio.  Amazing open downstairs patio in the summer, and an even better enclosed upstairs patio for the other seasons.  Definitely recommend the octopus on their brunch menu, as well as the flank steak.  Also, $1/oz house wines throughout the year (aa far as I know) - what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"If I were living in Toronto again, I would be a regular here.  The first few times I came here, I didn't have a reservation and had to leave because the wait was so long. I was lucky last week when I came by and thanks to the ice storm, the place had a few tables open. I now realize that this place has reservations you can make directly on Yelp, so I'll do that next time.   Whatever you do you must try one of the salads for an appetizer. The moroccan spiced chicken is also amazing and apparently one of the top dishes here.   I'd definitely recommend this place for a date spot, there's also lots of great nightlife around after dinner on King."}
{"text":"Great ambience, suitable for pairs or larger groups. Food is slightly consistent, some nights amazing some forgettable (or is it the people I'm with?) Try the kale salad, grilled octopus, any pasta - a pitcher of sangria is always nice. Especially enjoyable during the summer, warmer months when skylights brighten your lunch."}
{"text":"Great spot for authentic Italian food. The vibe is fun and great for a date night. The wine cellar room in the basement is great for a large group event. Really enjoy the family style menu. It offers something for everyone at a reasonable price. The pasta ai funghi is my favourite dish along with the kale salad. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch on Sunday and it was still packed. Service was friendly and fairly prompt. Most of the items are southern italian inspired. Big wood fired grill used to cook many items. I had the \"Spinaci\" pizza $15.50 - it's a super thin cracker like crust (not my fave as I prefer more of a chew a slightly more dough) and topped with spinach, buffalo mozzarella, pecorino, fresh ricotta, and sliced garlic. The ingredients were simple and fresh which made for a nice overall pizza.  The Ravoli Ricotta e Spinaci $16.50- tomato sauce, stracciatella cheese, basil is another simple ravioli dish. It was fine, nothing amazing, simple fresh ingredients.  Seating is close to other diners and it can get loud. Demographics was mostly late 20s crowd. Overall decent place for lunch."}
{"text":"this is based on drinks only - not food.  so i came here at thursday night with my SO, and the place was pretty full by the bar. there were still 3-4 tables empty though so there was no wait. we were seated by a friendly hostess at a table for two, towards the center of the room, with a nice view of the open kitchen. so first thing you notice when you walk in, is that the place is a great space. very nicely decorated, the crowd is typical for a king st crowd, it's lively. it's loud - you'll have to raise your voice or almost shout to speak to your company across the table. this isn't necessarily a bad thing given your occasion and tastes.   all the tables are very close together. like rubbing elbows close together. it's like they just tried to stuff as many tables in there as possible. too close for comfort for my tastes, and because of where we were sitting, people were always passing us, and we were being crowded from all angles. it was pretty annoying,  esp when paired with the crowd (who are typically exuberant, chatty, and loud.) and the music.   after we were seated, we waited. and waited. and waited. and waited. no one came to our table. we didn't get menus. no water. there were servers around us but they were all serving other tables. we figured it was because the place was a bit busy so we just chatted the entire wait. when our waitress finally came by, she was polite but didn't apologize for the wait. we got our drinks. i got a small glass of the house wine Pinot grigio b/c at this point i wasnt going to find this place fun, my SO got a negroni. he didn't like his drink - it was way to bitter. my PG was surprising good. very good house vino which normally is pretty crappy. i can see why ppl like this place, and i imagine their patio is super in the summer. i probably won't be back unless i'm dragged here for a birthday dinner or something at which point i'll try their food. i'm glad i didn't get food this time around b/c i probably would have had to wait hours for it to be served to me."}
{"text":"Great place with unique offering. We didn't have any of the usual fare and this  place was so good. Recommend the Kale Salad. We also tried the avocado toast and mushroom bruschetta. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended to me by my friends. We decided to take my sister there for her birthday last night. We were so excited! We had expectations that the food is going to be delicious and the service will be great!   First impressions? The host was welcoming. The restaurant is beautiful!  Once we were seated, we ordered the ginger beer and a couple of wines on tap. I loved the Pinot Grigio, my sister really appreciated the Cabernet Sauvignon and Ginger Beer.  We ordered 3 Arancinis to start. We thought it was good.  For our main courses, we had two Mafalde ai Funghi pastas, 10oz Bistecca and Prosciutto e Rucola pizza to share between the 3 of us siblings.   I have to admit, we weren't impressed with the pizza. However, The steak was delicious and we enjoyed that.   What we LOVED the most was the Mafalde ai Funghi pastas! It was so delicious! The pasta was perfectly cooked and the entire dish just came together so well.   Unfortunately, I can't say that our first time dining here was a great experience. Our server ruined the night. Prior to ordering, we had told her we were sharing the pizza. It came to us whole, uncut. We were struggling to slice it with the butter knife.   She checked on us once and even though she saw us raise our hands, she still walked away. When it came to paying, my brother and I split the bill. He had planned to tip in cash and after he payed by debit, the server rudely said \"You know tip is not included in the total???\" I didn't hear it but my sister did. Once I had paid and tipped, she ripped the receipt from the machine and walked away.  We thought it was so distasteful and rude. I was so upset that it ruined my sister's birthday. This is the only reason why I have to give it 3 stars. The service wasn't great and it ruined a special night."}
{"text":"Great wine and really great location but I was treated like a nuisance when they realised I only wanted drinks (with my party of 8).   I would give it another go for dinner maybe but don't expect any warmth from the servers there."}
{"text":"Very dimly lit with industrial, modern decor Gusto 101 seems to be a hip, popular place to wine and dine. We had about a 30 min wait on Saturday night around 7, not too bad.   Our waitress was friendly. But the food was just \"meh.\" I had the seafood linguini. It was decent, but lacked seasoning. Not what I expect from a 4 star avg review restaurant.  The tables are crazy close together. We were hoping for an intimate night out, but got just the opposite. Impossible to tune out the conversation of people sitting right next to you."}
{"text":"Amazing food that feels likes it straight out of Nona's kitchen. Somehow they manage to combine cafeteria style ordering with a seated service restaurant seamlessly. Amazing food!"}
{"text":"The food is packaged and not home made. The pizza sauce out of a can (and a poor quality one): no flavor, no seasoning. The crust was thin and mushy under, not what you expect from a true italian pizza. The agnoletti are out of a box, you can make it better by buying the Giorgio Rana in any supermarket (put in salted boiling water for 4min, drain, and serve with a bit of cream and sauteed cubes of pumpkin and sage). The ambiance was decent."}
{"text":"Food tastes horrible. Service is close to excellent. Prices are approximately 18$ a dish."}
{"text":"I just realize that I never posted my visit to Gusto 101 (@gusto101TO)  and it was back in August last year. I came here the previous week with a wait time of 2 hours, so we left a came back at a much earlier time. This is probably the busiest restaurant I have been so far, reservation online were only available for 5:30 or late 10:30.  It has two fabulous patios in full sun all day long, one at the front and a rooftop patio. Once a car garage, it is now a shell of the original with a very cool feel to it. Although I love the interior here, we opted for the patio to enjoy the very last hot sunny days...    Love the re-usable brown \"paper\" bag for the bread.   Mozzarella Bufala $15.50 ~ Tomato, basil oil, parmigiano crisp, smoked paprika, arugula ~ It was very refreshing and especially loved the basil oil with the mozzarella. Perfect for patio weather and even better with my glass of cold white wine   Polipo $14.50 ~ Char grilled octopus, olive tapenade, green beans, basil oil, citrus emulsion ~ This was perfectly cook, love the charred outer layer while the inside was cook just right. It was very tender, moist and flavorful.   Rigatoni Lucani $14.95 ~ shredded braised lamb, fresh herbs, shaved peperocino ~ Although we loved both our appetizers, we were not impress with our mains. This was good but really nothing memorable that I would go back to.   Brick Chicken ~ This was one of their special that day, don't remember much how it tasted apart from how dry it was    Passionfruit Mousse $4.95  ~ macerated strawberries, spiced biscotti  S'more Pudding $4.95 ~ maple graham crumble, chocolate creme, toasted marshmallow ~ I didn't like either of them, good thing it was tiny.   Verdict : ~ We love both our appetizers and we saw quite a few other one that we would like to try. ~ But both main and dessert was a disappointment. ~ I will definitely come back in summer time and just order a lot of the appetizers plus wine"}
{"text":"I come here only because I love their food (particularly their Fettuccine ai Funghi). I am not a fan of restaurants that are madhouses. This place is always at capacity, extremely loud, and everyone is packed into the restaurant like it's rush hour on the TTC. Luckily, if you go in small groups (i.e. a party of two), you shouldn't have to wait too long to get a table. But do be prepared to yell across the table to be heard and your elbows tucked in so you don't bump into someone else. And don't be offended if your server yells at you - s/he can't hear anything either. The space has a lot of character - it used to be an auto body shop - and it would be so amazing if the place was better lit and not as crowded to truly enjoy it's industrial feel."}
{"text":"Went yesterday evening for a birthday. Glad I reserved a table for 6pm because it was PACKED.  Food: I feel like the waitress recommends the same thing to everyone or everyone gets the mushroom pasta because when we looked around, its what everyone had. I had the Hamburger al Gusto and it was delicious. The burger was a little smaller than expected, but it came with big taste (and massive amounts of oil dripping out of it). The side of fries were delicious, just the right balance of crispy and soft. Sangria was super bitter, I got it with red wine so maybe try white for a sweeter taste?  Service: When you consider the fact that the restaurant had 100 things going on at once, I think we were served fairly quickly. Waters were always filled, food came pretty fast, when I asked for ketchup it was delivered to our table before the food even got there. Overall, I think it was great!  Environment: This is a bit tricky... The decor was amazing! The theme of the restaurant is kind of industrial and rustic which is super cool (clip board menus is definitely not a common occurrence) and the multigendered bathroom was very different as well. My party was seated on the upstairs patio which was beautiful, but even in the shade we were melting. (although that's not really because of the restaurant, maybe if they had overhead fans?) There was also a weird shower of little styrofoam bits floating down onto us... I have no idea where it was coming from, maybe the vents? It wasn't a massive amount, but there were points where I was concerned with accidentally ingesting some."}
{"text":"I've been to Gusto 101 several times and absolutely love it! They have a gorgeous patio which is heated in the winter. I only wish the restaurant was slightly less popular so that it wouldn't be so hard to get a seat!   House wine (red or white) is just $1 per ounce, and you can order at any increments. The alcoholic demon inside of me is leaping in excitement!  Now onto the food!  Polipo ($14.50) - Grilled octopus, chimichurri, olive tapenade, piquillo puree, arugula and fried capers. I'm not always a fan of grilled octopus, but this one was done well. The exterior was marvelously charred in the most delicious way, and the octopus itself was quite tender.   Bruschetta Guanciale e Taleggio ($10.95). Overall, I found this bruschetta to be a little salty, and I needed something to offset that salt.  Arancini ($9.95) - wild mushroom risotto, fontina cheese, tomato sauce. These risotto balls are practically $5 each so I found that a little pricey. Aside from that, I did enjoy the arancini a lot, especially when they were served piping hot.  Lasagne ($17.95) heirloom tomato, wild mushroom, italian eggplant, yellow zucchini, kale butter. We visited on a Sunday and luckily for us, lasgane was the special for the day! This was a very solid effort- the pasta layers were thin and delicate, so overall the dish didn't feel overly heavy, as lasagne often do. The sauce was also delectable and there were no complaints at the table.   Mushroom fettuccine ai funghi ($17.50) - portobello, porcini, oyster mushrooms, truffle paste,  light cream sauce. Hands down, one of my favourite pastas in town. I am particularly fond of mushroom pasta, but this was one of the best I've had! The al dente pasta was perfect for soaking up all the deep, earthy flavours of the mushrooms. This is a must try!  Overall, the food was amazing, the atmosphere is lovely and you really can't beat $1 per ounce wine on tap! I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went there on a weekday night. Got there at 5:30 and got seated (without a reservation) no problem. Within half an hour, the place was slammed.  I can see why people like this place. Nice (smallish) sized room with high ceilings and a warm, rustic decor.  I like my pizza simple. I like a THIN crust. And I like cooked ham and basil and cheese with chili flakes. I order the same thing everywhere I go. But they (like Pizzeria Libretto) don't offer cooked ham as an item. C'mon people, what gives?? LOL. So I just ordered a margherita pizza. Solid. (Better than the last place I went.)  The Good - margherita pizza was solid - service was good (There appeared to be almost as many staff as customers! LOL) - good buzz - nice decor  The Bad - having cooked ham as a pizza item would be nice - having one or two unconventional non-liquor choices would also be nice (like Boylan brand pop)  One note: the tables are really close together. I could hear EVERY last word  the people at the next table were saying. It was almost as if they were part of our table. Creates a good buzz in the room but not the place to go to talk to your SO to work out relationship problems! LOL"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and have been amazed by their food both times. Definitely authentic Italian fare that bought my taste buds back to Italy.  It's quite busy in the summer and hard to make reservations but I assure you if there's a wait, it's so worth it. There's a very rustic feel to the restaurant and I loved sitting upstairs (can be quite dark on the main floor).   The first time I came I ordered their daily Sunday special, lasagna! Beautifully plated and contained layers of cheesy goodness - my only complaint was that the portion was a bit small and didn't fill me up. It's hard to ever go wrong with lasagna so I had to come back and try something else.  Came back on a weekday for a work lunch and was surprised it was still quite busy at 2pm. This time I ordered their Regina Margherita pizza and had the arancini to start.  Not a lot of Italian restaurants serve arancini and not a lot of them do it right either. The arancini only came in 2 pieces and had the perfect amount of cheese oozing out when we cut into it and the risotto inside was amazing.  The Regina Margherita pizza was something I've been craving since I got back from Italy - bufala mozzarella is a thousand times better than your regular mozzarella. You MUST give it a try if you like cheese and haven't tasted it yet. The crust was perfection, thin and crispy, and no overly burnt areas. This was the pizza I've been searching for my entire time back in Toronto, and I'm so glad I finally found it. Like if I could marry a pizza, this would be the one.  Definitely will be coming back to try their Mafalde ai Fungi (mushroom pasta) and want to try their brunch as well! Gusto 101 definitely brought the Italian basics back to Toronto, grazie!"}
{"text":"The food is too expensive, the pasta portions are too small, my spaghetti was undercooked and the veal was way overdone. Our server even disputed the meal with my friend when he complained that his rigatoni dish tasted terrible."}
{"text":"Love love love their grilled octopus and kale salad. Would come here for lunch all the time when working around the area."}
{"text":"Was here in the summer.  4/5 Mostly cause me gusto their Mafalde ai Fungi pasta! But me not so gusto their portion size unproportionate to the cost And me not so much gusto their green icecream and hard frozen chocolate cookie sandwich that was pre-made for desert.   * note: I'm using \"gusto\" in the Tagalog translation, just so you know, and this review would make more sense ;-/  lol"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome vibe. Servers were very nice and knowledgeable. Great place to come with small groups. Pizza was huge and pasta was very flavorful and rich. Would definitely recommend checking this place out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is magnificent. Pro tip, ladies: grab a friend, go to Body Blitz for the afternoon and then follow that up with a meal at Gusto 101. You're welcome."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on the recommendation of a local who told us the crispy pork belly was their favorite around. So when we arrived on Saturday to discover that the pork belly was part of the daily special for Wednesday, I was bummed.   Looking to redeem ourselves, we decided to order the Saturday daily special instead, which was the steak for 2, but when our waitress came back and told us they had sold out it already, we were left bummed out again.   At this point we contemplated leaving because what we came for wasn't available, what we decided on instead was sold out, and there was nothing on the menu that I felt was worth the price they were asking. $17 pizza? $25-$30 entrees? This place seemed more like a bar and happy hour type place than a fine dining establishment. Nevertheless, we stayed.   I could see our waitress was getting angsty with us still trying to order, so we hurried up and ordered an appetizer. Seeing that there was bruschetta, we ordered that. Unbeknownst to us, this was not the traditional bruschetta that you can get at literally any and every place that offers it. You know, the typical basil, mozzarella, tomato, with oil and vinegar combo...our plate of odd bruschetta was put in front of us...I said to my friend, \"did we order mushrooms?\" their response was no, maybe this is a different type of tomato. So we bit into it. I immediately spit it out. It was mushrooms, which I'm allergic to. We called the waitress over and she clarified that it wasn't a traditional bruschetta but a mushroom one. My only question, which I did not vocalize out loud, was \"why the heck would you change something that wasn't bad\" I've never been to a restaurant and had someone say, \"Boy oh boy, I really wish I could have a mixed mushroom and ricotta bruschetta because this mozzarella, basil and tomatoes just isn't cutting it. TLDR: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.   Our waitress asked if we would like get a different app, she told us aloud what they were and when she said \"Buffalo Mozzarella\" we said okay that will work. Now maybe this is our mistake for being more familiar with the idea of \"Buffalo\" style food meaning hot and spicy as opposed to the actual animal Buffalo, so when again our app was placed in front of us and it was just a few pieces of plain looking cheese, we instantly were disappointed realizing it was \"Buffalo Milk Mozzarella\" and not \"Buffalo Style Mozzarella\" (which is a thing by the way, and it's quite tasty). The cheese was just blah and for $19 I really could have cried because I was so frustrated at that point.   Hungry beyond belief, my friend was insistent that we stay. I was ready to leave and just get dinner elsewhere but it was prime time for dinner and we knew anywhere else would mean waiting again to get a table.   Finally, it was time for our main entrees. I don't remember what my friend got but mostly because I finished my meal in about 10 seconds, got up and started walking up the street to get my next dinner because I was so pissed at this point. Why did I do this you ask? I ordered the $18 ravioli (crazy that my entrée was cheaper than my app) and it came with literally 4 RAVIOLIS. WHAT IN THE ACTUAL HELL. They weren't jumbo ravioli, they weren't flavorful ravioli. They were lukewarm, bland, and slighty crunchier than al dente. I was fuming. I wolfed down my food, got up and left my friend to finish their meal.   I think the total came to over $80 and I've never been more hungry in my life afterwards.   Immediately after leaving, we looked for a tapas style place to get more food from and made a B-Line to start eating again."}
{"text":"This place has more appeal than merely than $1/ounce house wine made especially for them. That's a gimmick (and a good one!), but it's supported by great food and great service. They always get my order correct, the food arrives promptly but isn't rushed, service is friendly but not cloying and everything is tasty (\"gusto\", get it?). Yes, it can be loud and crowded, but now you know that before you go, so no complaining about this teensy issue. Big portions, if that's your thing. Reservations are by set-aside tables but only at certain times. Seating includes half-banquettes, tables and bar tables. They have private areas for larger groups."}
{"text":"Consistently good service and quality of food. I'm never disappointed which is why it's a reliable choice for when I am entertaining friend's from out of town."}
{"text":"We loved everything about the place except that we were unable to read the menu without using a flashlight.  I don't like restaurants that are too bright but this was so dark that not only could you not see the menu... you couldn't see what you were eating. I couldn't tell one thing from another on the antipasto plates."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's top 3 in my favourite restaurants. I always order their Brussels sprouts and their mushroom pasta. SO GOOD. I have tried their famous kale salad, and it was ok, but nothing special in my opinion. Service is always really friendly. The atmosphere is really dark and loud (around dinner time)."}
{"text":"I will definitely recommend this to anyone! For a Tuesday it was pretty crowded. The don't take reservations and our waiting time was 30 minutes but they probably called in 10. The service was good but the food was outstanding. The Tapas were all great! The only downfall was that it was pretty crowded and loud. You could barely speak and it was easier to hear the people at others tables instead of yours."}
{"text":"This delicious Italian location is dangerously near King St W for my liking, but don't harp on Gusto by frat-boys-with-pay-cheques association. The food is tasty, the people are lovely and I'm stuffed to the gills.   I had the mushroom fettuccini and it was truffle oiled, parmed up goodness. It wasn't a disgustingly large American pasta portion, but it was still too much. I paired it with their dollar per ounce red, 18 ounces to be exact, and together they made a perfect mismatched meal.   The ambiance is woody, exposed brick, quirky lights and an open kitchen. Pretty standard for Toronto, but the standard works. I'm a bit bummed by how close together they seat their tables, but I get it. More tables, more money.   PEPPER POINTS: This $1 per ounce wine shit is the shit. The. Shit."}
{"text":"Great place...I suppose that's why it's always busy!!!! I really wish they would take reservations!!! Nevertheless, I'll keep coming back to this place as the ambiance, the food, the wine (which you can opt to buy their pay by the ounce) is great. Again, just be cognizant if you're showing up with a big group at a typical dinner time and not expect to wait a while. Unfortunately you can't even really wait by the bar, as it's packed too. Oh well."}
{"text":"If i could copy paste word awesome food in yelp many times, that how i would probably describe this place."}
{"text":"I've been to Gusto 101 on a number of occasions (for brunch and dinner) and it's great every time.  The atmosphere and decor of the restaurant gives off an industrial, rustic, and trendy vibe. The service is friendly and I've rarely had to wait for a table here (brunch is especially a good time to go because it's pretty quiet then!). I've gone for dinner numerous times but never had to wait that long for a table (maybe since usually we only have a party of 2).  Went one time for brunch and the waitress had forgotten to put our order in which resulted in us waiting a long time for our food. As a result, she offered us a choice of free dessert (which was awesome!).   Dishes I would get again:  Uova in Camicia (brunch) - Like an eggs benny except on brioche bread, with crispy prosciutto and fontina cheese.  Sangria - Umm...it's sangria and it's good! Need I say more?   Mafalde ai Funghi - I am not a huge fan of mushrooms to begin with but I would eat mushrooms if it was cooked like this any day. Love it!  I know I'll be back at Gusto 101 in the future."}
{"text":"Loud, busy and extremely popular even on a Monday evening in Toronto! My husband and I shared the Regina Margherita pizza. It was quite delicious. Not the best pizza we've ever had, but still very good. Great prices on the house wine $1/oz the well shots were expensive, a gin and tonic was over $10. We got a seat upstairs and the atmosphere is hard to beat. Great for people watching and the decor is very neat. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had the funghi pizza there for lunch yesterday....really good quality product.  Love having another great restaurant in the neighbourhood and excited to visit for dinner down the road when it's not chock full of the Thompson Hotel crowd.  LOVE the concept of table wine on tap.  The Pinot Grigio was the better of the two.  Aromatic, acidic, refreshing.  The Cab/Merlot was disappointing considering the region can produce some great reds.  I'm sure they'll change that as the waiter said that was generally the line of thinking from most visitors."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place tonight after wanting to for a while!  It looked super busy when we got there so I thought there would for sure be a wait but they offered 2 tables- one inside with a view of the chef and one outside at a table that surrounds the sky light. We decided to stick to outside to avoid the heat from the ovens! It was a pretty cool setup it was this glass table that multiple people sat at. My boyfriend and I sat at a corner as we saw most people were doing, it was cute and intimate and we could face each other and there was more room than we needed on the table.  We ordered octopus and kale salad to start on top of our drinks, he got some Italian beer and I got a cesar which I asked for to be not too spicy and of course it was but hey I guess I'll have to start getting used to that mistake lol. I didn't touch the octopus but supposedly it was good! and the kale salad was great, simple but a good portion size and more than enough to share.  For our mains he got pizza with meatballs on it and I got this chicken that came with greens and those weird onion things that look like circle potatoes. Both very good although I kind of wish I went with my gut and ordered the mushroom pasta because it looked unreal!! But I decided to take the healthier route :P   Overall a really good experience, super cool environment and good vibe! I will definitely be back, I'll come back after I've had a really healthy week so I feel less guilty when I order that mushroom pasta!! mmmm  mmmmm"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 8 girls for a bachelorette party and it was awesome! The atmosphere was great and the food was even better! I ordered a pizza with prosciutto, mozz and arugula, it was to die for!  The cocktails were great also!   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We went there for a family dinner on Sunday. It was jam packed and extremely noisy. i felt we are in a night club. Missing any comfortable area to wait for your table, people were standing at the narrow doorway blocking the exit, like rush hours at the TTC. (The bar was full as well). My daughter has been here before with friends, she said it's always packed and I really couldn't see the reason. The food was really nothing to remember or mention. We had salmon-pretty small piece, sea bass -swimming in oil and a prosciutto pizza-you could hardly cut it. The service is unbelievably slow, prepare to wait 15-20 minute to see a server in the crowded place.   The only positive feature I can mention the house wine, both red and white is pretty good with a good price."}
{"text":"the layout and ambiance was pretty cozy; with the tight seating making it even cozier. (i had to sit at the end of the table right next to the galley).  i had the 10 oz bistecca, it was cooked perfect (medium rare) BUT it was WAY too salty. i don't know what kind of seasoning they used but i downed my wine pretty quickly.  i tried some of my friend's fries and they were also very salty. the octopus app was really good and i definitely recommend giving that a try."}
{"text":"Greet by the friendliest host ever then smells delicious food all around. Food was really good! The beef tartar with truffles butter and you must order bruschetta! It's the best that I've ever had, warmly toasted to crunchy, topped with sauté mushrooms full of flavour and covered with melting cheese! Don't know what that cheese called, but it was full of buttery characters! The truffle cream sauce pasta is another must other! Like don't ask question, just order it and you will feel it! Pizza was great, again the cheese game in this restaurant is top notch; however I prefer more soft and tensity/chewy dough. But will have to come back for the drinks and other delci"}
{"text":"Easily one of the more decent non-pretentious restaurants on King. It's basically the same food as Trattoria Nervosa with more younger crowds being on King West. $1 per ounce wine on tap is awesome, it's not bad wine either. My favourite food is the Insalata di Cavolo Nero (kale salad) and Mafalde (mushroom pasta) same as Nervosa. And the Polipo (octopus). It's fun in the summer but gets busy after-work hours."}
{"text":"Visiting from New York and while looking for places to eat we stumbled upon gusto on yelp. We decided to check it out on a Friday night. The ambiance was delightful, good energy. We were seated immediately on the second floor since the first one was full, We were able to overlook the street and people watch. The food was delicious , mojitos were tasty and strong ! And the service was excellent. Definitely a must next time we're back in Toronto"}
{"text":"A staple hangout; try the house wine or any of the salads/pasta. Get there early because they don't take reservations.   Update: They do take reservations and that makes this an even better place!!"}
{"text":"Very hip and trendy place. A friend brought me here after a long flight. I arrived around 10 on a Saturday night and the kitchen was still open. I was starving and my friend recommended that I try one of their specialty dishes. I had the Mafalde ai Funghi, which was a mushroom pasta with truffle cream sauce. The best and only vegetarian dish I have truly ever enjoy and was satisfied with. The truffle cream sauce has so rich flavoring. It was seasoned perfectly! A great place to take a date or to just catch up with friends. Highly recommend going to gusto101"}
{"text":"First thing you should know about Gusto is they only take reservations for 12pm and 6pm, that's it, otherwise be prepared to wait.  We arrived a bit after 9pm on a Saturday night and you could see the crowd of people outside waiting to get in. You'd think we were all waiting in line for a club. The hostess desk was located outside, we were told it was a 45 min to an Hour wait, gave our name and number, and were told we would receive a text when our table was ready and we had 5 minutes to return or else we would lose our spot.  I did like the idea of receiving the text so we could stroll around king street in the mean time. We were told we could go to the bar inside however it was soo crowded and packed we opted not to.  About 40 mins later our table was ready. The restaurant itself is a pretty cool space, once an auto body shop now converted into an  Italian Trattoria. They have limited seating inside however they have a patio out front and on the roof.  We were seated along a shared banquet at a cozy table along a mirrored wall. The restaurant was really packed and extremely loud yet with the dim lighting and candle light table it still managed to evoke a romantic ambiance.  We started off with two glasses of Prosecco which was light, bubbly and refreshing.  One of the highlights of this resto that they make there own wine on tap and sell it at $1 per ounce! Obviously I had to sample both the red and white at that price. As a predominately white wine drinker hands down I preferred the perfectly chilled light crisp Gusto Bianco - Pinot Grigio over the dry & more intensely flavoured Gusto Rosso - Cabernet Sauvignon & Malbec   For apps we decided to split an Insalate Grande.   Tagliata di Manzo - grilled flank steak, arugula, roasted grape tomatoes, shaved pecorino, balsamic vinaigrette Definitely a Huge Salad! The hefty portion of perfectly cooked medium rare steak as requested was very tender and flavourful. Loved the balsamic dressing and peppery arugula and the roasted grape tomatoes were soo sweet and juicy.  As a natural born pizza lover I knew what my main had to be  Polpette - tomatoes, mozzarella, meatballs, smoked provolone The juicy halved meatballs remained tender and sheeted under a delicious smokey blanket of provolone. I couldn't help myself from picking them off and gobbling them down before a taking a bite into that thin and crispy crust. I think Gusto definitely takes the prize for crispiest crust! Loved biting into that crunch!  And Finally Dessert  Smores Creme Brulee - Crispy bruleed topping covering a creamy marshmallow topping and rich dense chocolatey pudding and crumbled graham. Tiny portion but more than enough to satisfy a sweet tooth.  Pistachio Gelato - Subtle pistachio flavour with vanilla undertones playing on both sweet and salty tastebuds. Again another small portion however ample enough to satisfy any sweet tooth.  Disregarding the long wait for a table and receiving bread after completing half of our app, service during our meal was acceptable considering how busy the resto was. Everything we tasted was delicious and despite the loudness and packed quarters the vibe here definitely is electric with a trendy crowd. I'd say it's definitely one of those places that elicits the saying \"To see and  be seen\".  FYI Washrooms located on the downstairs are UNISEX."}
