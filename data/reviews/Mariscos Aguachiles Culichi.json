{"text":"Todo el tiempo qe comemos en este lugar el precio y la calidad de la comida cambian demasiado mejor Boy a volver alas islitas cursando la calle hay más calidad en la comida y sirven mejor cantidad"}
{"text":"Although the guacamole and shrimp ceviche cocktail had a  good taste, I believe they can improve on the cleanness and taste of the shrimp, by deveining the shrimp."}
{"text":"Estan sabrosos Los Aguachile. igual que Culiacan.   puro Santana Cosala, Sinaloa vergas"}
{"text":"At first glance you wouldnt think this place is worth trying. Think again. This place is delicious. The food we ordered was very delicious and flavorful. You have to stop by and try it you wont regret it."}
{"text":"A must when you are in town!!! Best cruda-killer in Vegas!!! I recommend the ostiones preparados!!! Bomb.com!!!!!"}
{"text":"They fucken suck and it's so dam expensive 90 dollars for my gf and me never going to this and they have bad customer service dirty freakin place"}
{"text":"Tried this place after my friends had talked highly about it!

We started off with a micheladas which was delicious!!

We ordered the aquachiles and it was good, but not the best I've had! The flavor seems a little watered down for my own
The langoustines were not as fresh as we expected, maybe it's not in season

Lastly we had a fish baked in foil with vegetables, that smelled amazing and it's almost like a fish curry! 

All in all, it was a good experience"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on 8/13. Food was ok, service was pretty on point, pretty clean location. They provide a free soup as soon as you walk in which was nice but very salty. The servers are pretty on point, they have a buzzer on the booths to call them over when you need them, which I thought was cool. The music is loud but it's a Mexican restaurant you should expect it, I though it was nice. Overall ok, I just thought price was a bit high to be served a complementary soup in a styrofoam cup. Towards the end they do let knock off perfume vendors come in to sell you perfume, I didn't care, but it was new to me."}
{"text":"Bomb ass food but service hella of sucks and go to the restroom before u come to this place peaceeeee bunch of flyies  too so be ready"}
{"text":"The best place for aguachiles along with everything else on the menu . The mojarras are delicious , their limonada mineral is great. They serve it to you slushy style with a salted rim:) their portions are great for family style eating . The parilladas are the best , theres something for everyone. All the servers there make you feel so welcome , it's all around a great place to enjoy a delicious meal!!! If your looking for delicious treat with big portions come here you won't regret it!!!!"}
{"text":"Best sea food place in Las Vegas authentic Mexican Sinaloense sea food.   It feels like your in Mexico when you are there. Service is awesome and they are fast too. Their homemade lemon aid is delicious!"}
{"text":"Estos mariscos están muy ricos el servicio un poco lento, pero lo demás esta muy rico, fuimos un grupo de amigos en dos o tres ocasiones y después yo fui con mi novio esta muy rico todo ! Los precios están accesibles, tratamos de pedir de todo un poco"}
{"text":"Overall good mariscos, but I'm a person that doesn't like load music and this place has load music. I also have to understand that this type of places are just like that."}
{"text":"New place tables chairs new remodeled food is awsome clean and fast service. Good authentic Mexican seafood awsome"}
{"text":"I have came here twice and still can't get enough of their menu, service is great they are so nice, clean atmosphere and great music.
When you go in they give you shrimp soup, tostadas and salsa with key limes."}
{"text":"El mejor caldo de camarón y el guacamole culichi que he probado en USA. Los molcajetes culichi y los filetes de pescado son deliciosos. La atención muy buena también. Cada vez que vengamos a las Vegas éste será mi restaurante favorito"}
{"text":"El mejor restaurante de mariscos en las Vegas, deliciosos platillos, y una extensa variedad  para todos los gustos. 
Los Fines de semana excelente ambiente para compartir con los amigos ya que cuentan con karaoke,
Una buena opción para disfrutar."}
{"text":"We decided to take a chance and try this place out instead of going to our regular spot for seafood. Never again. Next time we will go to our regular spot and not be disappointed Food is ok- good but not great. I ate only because I was starving lol. Seriously though, very overpriced, small portions and I don't know if it's possible to ask for MORE salt considering how much they put in the food already. Been there, done that. Never going back. They only get two stars bc the service was good."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place Service food drinks it was delish....
I have tostada de ceviche de pescado soooo GOOD then me and hubby shared a molcajete which was also perfect who ever comes across this place u guys gotta try it"}
{"text":"Excelentes mariscos  Molcajete delicioso buena porcion y buen sabor  la mesera muy atenta Mayra ! Gracias claro q estaremos de vuelta !"}
{"text":"Came to visit from california place is not in the greatest area but WOW all the seafood was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I feel like in mexico eating authentic mexican seafood with a beer. This place is delishus. I love it"}
{"text":"If you're in Vegas and want some real authentic Mexican food don't look for it on the strip this place is worth the drive"}
{"text":"Where do I start. Probably the most authentic Mexican Food I ever had. I never had aguachile or mechilada before, but from the recommendation a friend gave, my life has been changed. This place does it right. Its ambiance, style of food, and service is as close wa it gets. LOVE this place and won't stop coming back."}
{"text":"Fabulous Mexican seafood restaurant!  Festive and frienly establishment. Great Aguachile (Shrimp Ceviche) in this side of the border, spicy generous portion of shrimps marinated and cooked in lime juice. 
My boy had Shrimp Quesadilla with rice and beans... He commented \"Soooo gggooood, I will have this dish again for sure\".
Prompt service, however we were told that Sunday's lunch time is very busy.  We went Saturday regardless it was busy!
There's outside seating available.
Prices as expected for seafood.
Highly recommended... most dishes are spicy but if not your taste let your server know and the food will be prepared even without any chile!!"}
{"text":"First this place is a 3.5 but I am rounding up due to service.Sservice here is good! The staff is very attentive and ready to please. The food was ok and a lot for the price. The crab was a little dry due to the way it was cooked in the 5 person platter."}
{"text":"My new favorite in Las Vegas.  Not perfect with prices a little high but the Micheladas are the best in town and the shrimp caldo as you sit down is a nostalgic touch.  Food is solid and the grilled chicken out at the truck for takeout is the best in town."}
{"text":"Hole in the Wall Feeling but the Food is Delicious with Awesome portions no Fancy Fancy Just Great Food, definitely a new Favorite for my visits to Vegas. 

Thanks to Luis Moreno for the Food Suggestions."}
{"text":"Este restaurant se merece 5 estrellas. Meseros muy amables comida buena y mariscos deliciosos. Se lo recomiendo a todos los que quieran comer como reyes."}
{"text":"I live  in los angeles so it was hard f0r me to find a good seafood place to eat in vegas Loved the food great customer service micheladas were bomb ...highly recommend these place"}
{"text":"Went a few months ago on vacay, and heard about this place on the radio so I went on yelp and they had good reviews so we decided to try it out. It was kind of far from the actual Las Vegas downtown but worth the drive. The place was a little kind of small place but they had music and bomb food. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"The place was pretty good. The ambiance could be improved, not a big fan of all the red booths, but the food I really enjoyed. I would visit again for sure."}
{"text":"I was excited about trying this new restaurant, but I was extremely disappointed. I ordered camarones a la diabla. Presentation of the dish was average. The food was too salty for my taste. Shrimp was super salty and the beans were suppose to be refried but were liquid. The rice was on pint. Price was average 15$ for my plate alone. Service was good."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, drinks are to die for & their customer service couldn't be better. I love coming here, it's never a disappointment I highly recommend their shrimp tacos they are the best in town! definitely one of my favorite sea food places of all time."}
{"text":"Just a little overpriced, but the food was great and drinks. I had Camarones en aguachile, and my boyfriend Camarones empecherados, and both were very good. The service was good as well, greatly appreciate that. Sinaloa style, awesome seasoning!"}
{"text":"The food isn't that great, it's just like any other seafood restaurant in Vegas. And it's definitely not Sinaloense style. To me it's like they tried to make it similar to the CulichiTowns that are in California, but the food is nothin like it. It has no flavor. Their Preparadas/micheladas aren't that great either. 

They do provide good customer service."}
