{"text":"This spot is always busy during lunch time. The portions are huge and very good. I come here all the time for lunch.   Perfect place for small groups. I would say it's good to come here with just a couple as there is always a wait and the restaurant is very small. Although there is a wait the service is always fast. Awesome mom and pop shop!!  I always get the oxtail vermicelli, But I think I am going to switch it up next time and try the mutton instead."}
{"text":"After my coma-inducing hot yoga class last night, I needed something to replenish my electrolytes.  I was also feeling like a 10 lb. weight was attached to my forehead every time I bent over to do downward dog, which signaled that my sinuses were acting up.  What better way to nurse a potential cold then with a bowl of something warm?  After doing a quick search on my handy Yelp app, I found South China Noodles Delight.  It tucked away in a plaza on Midland that has been around since antiquity.  If it weren't for Yelp I wouldn't have even known that there would be good food lurking around in this plaza.  All the food eateries are right at the corner of Midland & Finch and they probably get the bulk diners piling in.  The restaurant itself is quite small, with a maximum capacity of about 20-25 people.  It is a family-run place that apparently has been around for quite a long time.  Their menu is not extensive with a short list of appetizers, beverages, and noodles (wet or dry). Seeing as I was bloated to the nines from water retention due to a sodium overdose at dim sum on Sunday, I decided to not get a soup noodle which no doubt would be laced in sodium.  I ordered the Dry Oxtail Noodle which basically means its made with a sauce versus soup. The oxtail was amazingly tender and bursting with flavour.  The five spice and cloves were aromatic as soon as the dish reached the table.  Make sure you mix the noodles from the bottom up as the sauce sits all at the bottom.  If you don't mix it, then you may end up with a gradient of bland to extremely salty noodles towards the end.  There were also bits of pickled greens in the dish which made for an interesting surprise for the taste buds.  I also got a cup of Hot Soy Milk and it was quite good.  I have never had a good experience with warm soy beverages as I feel that the soy flavour is too dominant sometimes and makes the drink sour?  Otherwise, it gives you a sugar overload.  This one was just the right amount of sweet and the soy flavour was subtle as opposed to in your face.  The decor here makes me think that pandas are going to pop up at any minute as the furniture is made of bamboo and wood.  This is probably supposed to emulate Guilin, with its famed scenery of forests, mountains and waterfalls for which the Chinese name of South China Noodles Delight is named.  Verdict:  All in all, the meal cost a little over $10  ($7.50 for a large noodle).  I am absolutely enamoured by the oxtail, which is bursting with intense flavour.  In fact, I wish the ratio of oxtail to noodles was biased towards more oxtail as it drowned in the river of noodles.  The only negatives about this place are that it reeks heavily of bleach (at least you know the place is clean?) and that they close at 9PM."}
{"text":"This place is hidden in plaza as man reviewers have said,  The service can be slow at times as only the owners couple serving the entire store, during weekend you most likely will need to wait for seats,  The food is great, broth is rich and full of flavor, noodle is average, while the topping varies, but here are the popular choices: Intestine, ox tail, beef, lamb"}
{"text":"\"Guilin Noodle Shop\" is the English translation of the Chinese restaurant name. What's Guilin? It's ONLY one of the most beautiful scenery places in China! There is even a popular saying \"Guilin's scenery is best among all under heaven.\"   Another popular item in Guilin is Rice Noodle. I've always known this version of ROUND spaghetti-like rice noodle in Hong Kong's popular dish Rice Noodle with BBQ Goose. I love this type of rice noodles and that's why I visited on this day.   The shop is small and manned by a couple where the man does the cooking and the lady does the prep and cash. They've always been closed on Wednesdays so when I came in Thursday it had a good turn out. 6 of the 8 tables were FILLED and most watching Cantonese show on Television.   The Menu has Appetizers, Noodle in Soup, Rice, Dry Noodle, and Beverages(See Photo). I ordered the Mutton Vermicelli in Soup($7.00/small) which was a regular portion but it does take time since it's a 2 man OPERATION.   It's a scorcher in here as they leave a crack of space open from the front door as well as a small FAN near the corner. If you add CHILI sauce, you might need a change of clothes.   The noodle came and it looks plain and simple but the Mutton was so TENDER and had a depth of flavour, I am declaring I will come back for this exact dish again.   The noodle is good and I'm saying good because I love it to begin with, nobody can really SCREW up this type of noodle.   The Soup Stock was pretty good although might be bit on the salty side but I wasn't complaining as I ate it. It had Cilantro, Scallions, Pickled Cabbage, Wood Ear Fungus served in the soup as well. I just LOVE this, no matter what others say and that's my final word.   I was contemplating about the Deer version of this dish instead so maybe I'll order BOTH next time. It is on the pricey side for a bowl of noodle at a Chinese noodle shop but I'll willing to pay and the other people coming in the shop are too."}
{"text":"This place has some strange hours. They're open until 4pm every day. That's it. They're also hidden in this little plaza I didn't realize had restaurants. I tried coming before, but didn't have the hours, so it was closed. I finally made it!  Skinny. The tables here are skinny and so are the chairs, if I recall correctly. It'll do, but it's unusual. Service is efficient. The kitchen is open concept, so you can definitely see what's going into your noodles.  We got the oxtail soup noodles, the lamb soup noodles, and the pig knuckle dry noodles. We also got a plate of veggies on the side. There were lots of noodles, but there could have been more oxtail and more pig knuckle. There was a decent amount of lamb. The oxtail was tender and flavorful. So were the pig knuckles. The lamb was my favorite. I like the taste of lamb, and this certainly had it. I believe the small oxtail was $11, the small lamb was $10, and the small pig knuckle was $7, so these aren't your cheapest bowls of noodles, but they are delicious. I love the texture of the noodles, and the broth is delicious as well. My only gripe is that the dry noodles don't have additional flavoring that you wouldn't get in the soup noodles, so they're on the blander side of things. The man in the kitchen did pour pig knuckle sauce over them, so they weren't as dry as I expected dry noodles to be, but they still needed some extra oomph.  All in all, I quite enjoyed eating lunch here. Until next time, soup noodles!"}
{"text":"This very authentic Chinese noodle place is a \"hidden\" gem! When we arrived for lunch on Saturday, this place was packed and we had to wait a bit. Food came out fairly quickly since they were constantly making noodles. It was my first time trying thick vermicellie noodles, and I was not a huge fan of this noodle. It was hard for me to grab these slippery noodles with thick Chinese chopsticks (I am better at using Chinese chopsticks now :D).   Huge portion!! I ordered small but I wasn't even close to finishing the entire bowl. They also give you generous amount of meat!   Overall, worth trying this place out if you are looking for a bowl of good noodle soup and ready to be in a food coma afterwards."}
{"text":"So sad to hear that this place is closed down... I wanted to go recently but did not have the time to. The broth was very aromatic and savoury. The toppings were very tender and yummy (especially the ox-tail). The place itself wasn't big and the seats/table were small but it was adequate for an in-and-out. Hope they relocate and open again."}
{"text":"A-OK. This is a small noodle shop that seats around 15-20 people max. It is hidden in a plaza and honestly didn't know it existed until I was looking for a place to eat during lunch. The hours are weird it's open until 4pm and accepts cash only.   I got the Beef Balls and Beef Tripe Noodles, the soup base was okay but a very light flavour. Maybe because I like strong and bolder flavours, I felt it was lacking and I added chili oil to it which made the overall dish more flavourful.   For the price, it's a good deal as you get a decent amount of noodles. I got the small for 8.00$ and it was filling, I could not imagine even getting the large. Overall, it's a good place for a quick meal at a fair price. But as it's a small place, there could be wait depending on when you go. Give it a try but don't forget to have cash on hand."}
{"text":"You should eat here. It's hard to find. There hours are obnoxiously short (11-4) and seats are hard to come by.   Regardless of these obstacles, you should eat here.  The broth is amazing, it's rich and aromatic. The noodles are acceptable, the toppings are tender and savoury.   Service is fast, seats turn over fast. You are in and out with a nice bowl of noodles in you.   5/5 would eat here between the hours of 11-4 again"}
{"text":"Took a trip north of the border not too long ago. Why is the food way better in Toronto than NYC? Whats up with all these crazy hours that would never fly in NYC? And whats up with ordering via a checklist everywhere? I actually love that option because for an ABC who can't read chinese, it works AWESOME. Never would've found this place if my parents didn't tell me it was a must try. I wish I could eat this every day. The noodles were so \"wat\", the soup was slurping delicious and the meats...OMG the meats is what I dream of everyday at work when I'm looking for some lunch.  Had the brisket, the pork chop, and the offal, our nieces snickered when I said I wanted some awful noodles.I love Offal and this place kicks ass. What I love is that you even get a little lung in there. Definitely something that is nearly impossible to come by in the states, Thinking about it is making my mouth water. I hate writing yelp reviews on the good stuff because it just makes you crave it and it sucks that I can't have it again for God knows how long. A big eater like me couldn't finish the big bowl so only get that if you're feeling starvin'Marvin.  If you are visiting the Markham/Scarbourough area, make sure you hit this spot either right when it opens or a couple hours after lunch. Its a pretty small shop. I had a party of six and were lucky to get there right when it opened. 30 minutes later there was a line. This was a weekday too.  *side note* Nothing related to the shop but I had to add a picture of an ugly car that was in the parking lot. I didn't see any marketing on it so it was a personal car. Why would anyone do that?"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 3/5 Hidden in a small plaza on Midland Ave. between McNicoll Ave. and Finch Ave. E (I know, it's kindof hard to find). There were plenty of parking spots when we went there for lunch on a weekend.  [SERVICE] - 3/5 Average. Server brought our order sheet to the kitchen and brought us our order after a few minutes.  [DÉCOR] - 4/5 Reminisced a small noodle shop in Southern China with their wooden furniture, and fai chun on thewalls (red strips of paper with phrases to bring good luck and prosperity). I also noticed the chairsare very narrow, probably because this place is good for a quick meal (typical Chinese-style lunch),and you really don't need to be too comfortable.  [FOOD QUALITY] - 3/5 Meats were high-quality and tender. Broth was also very rich, but a little too oily. One of the biggestdrawbacks was that the noodles were too soggy.  [ORDER] - 3/5 - Large Ox Tail Vermicelli in Soup - $11.00: ox tail was braised very well as the flavours were so pleasantly savoury with a hint of sweetness.  - Large Mutton Vermicelli in Soup - $10.00: mutton had subtle flavours, not gamey, but was a little bland in comparison with the ox tail.  [OVERALL] - 3/5 I would give this place a higher rating, but noodle texture plays a major role in a good bowl ofnoodles, and this one was not firm enough for my liking. Other than that, the Ox Tail Vermicelliin Soup would be perfect if you enjoy deliciously braised ox tail and noodles with a softertexture."}
{"text":"Friend brought me to this place for the ox tail vermicelli noodle soup.  It's a very small shop run by husband and wife. Maybe sits about 15 people at most.   Was $10 for a small bowl and $12 for a large bowl. I honestly should've ordered the small. It's been a really long time since I had to tap out and not finish my entire meal.  There was lots of flavours. Some pickled veggies, the soup base, some spices, and the succulent ox tail. The ox tail was very soft and fall off the bone. They were not stingy on noodles at all and was the main reason I couldn't finish my meal. I was STUFFED. The vermicelli is not the thin almost clear noodles that you would expect but it was a thicker round noodle. The noodles were very soft as well, which if u don't know by now, I love anything saucy, soft, or mushy.   anyway, i'm about to take a nap now. it's one of those meals, you know?"}
{"text":"South China Noodles Delight for sure serves a delightful bowl of noodles!   When I entered the restaurant, I was immediately hit by the aroma of meat broth... it smelled so strong, so rich and herbally spicy. This is always a good sign.. that the broth is going to be awesome!   Oxtail Vermicelli in Soup ($7.50/big)  - That oxtail is so tender... and flavoured... it must have been slow cooked for hours in a soy/spices based broth in order to achieve that level of tenderness  - The garnishes: preserved sour veggie, coriander and green onion gave extra depth and excitement to the taste buds  - Broth is really flavoured... with a hint of herb and peppery taste... no chili oil needed to enhanced that   Size wise it is filling and good value since it is really time consuming for anyone trying to attempt to duplicate the same bowl of goodness at home!   Cash Only!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place closed down. I was looking forward to trying it. They posted up a for lease sign on the door."}
