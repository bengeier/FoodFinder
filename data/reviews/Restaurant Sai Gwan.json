{"text":"The worst ever! Horrible food and terrible service! The wonton is meatless. I came from 7:40 set there for more than an hour untill the the food is served at 9pm. Worst experience and worst food in Canada! Trust me just leave this one!"}
{"text":"The noodles themselves are unique as they differ from the others around. The noodles at Sai Gwan are egg flour noodles and are not the wheat-flour \"pulled\" noodles as some noodle-heads are used too. I ordered the wonton \"lo mien\", which means \"mixed noodle\". The soup comes on the side and you can spoon it over each bite as you make your way through the dish, or sip it on its own. The noodles sit in a puddle of a soy sauce and oil mixture with sugar and white pepper with scallions (mixing is necessary). Coincidently, you've just been witness to the shattering of a world record of how many times the word \"noodle\" can be used in a paragraph.

There are certain things you order at different restaurants if you have any clue what you're doing there. You're not going to a truck stop to order their version of Boeuf Bourguignon. To give this place a bad rap based on your own ignorance is unfair.  Have their specialties, everything else is just filler."}
{"text":"The fact that they say they make their own noodle attracts me to try this place out.

I ordered a dumpling noodle soup (?????) and prawn wonton soup (????). The egg noodle is quite nice and not soggy. It might be true that they made the noodle themselves but I can't really prove that. The dumpling is just okay, can taste a bit of pork and lots of black fungus. The prawn wonton is made with prawn and a bit of pork.

Considering the reasonable price on the menu, the place is okay. I'll definitely come back with my #heart to let him try it."}
{"text":"Had 4 plates here, many to chose from, all ours were excellent.  Shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings, some beef noodle thing and vegetable plate.  Ate everything (we were very hungry.  I will definitely return   Service was good and they were happy we enjoyed."}
{"text":"We ordered three dishes:

1. Spicy noodle with pork mince
Very tasty! They are known for their noodles, which are likely made in-house. This was quite spicy, too.

2. House wonton noodle soup.
Delicious. This is a house specialty. Everything is homemade and the flavours are excellent. 

3. Rice hot pot with chicken on the bone and Chinese sausage
So yummy. The rice from the edges is crunchy. All the flavours of the chicken bones and sausage cook into the rice. 

If you know what to order, here, you're in for a treat. It's not a big or busy restaurant, and is a bit off the beaten path of Chinatown."}
{"text":"Okay, I'll go ahead and say it directly - Sai Gwai is the best Cantonese restaurant in Montreal.  

Alright, to justify my statement I would need to make several things clear:

First, there isn't much Cantonese restaurants left in Montreal.

Most Canadians probably didn't realize it, but there has been a demographic shift in most old Chinatowns in the past 20 years.  The old Chinatowns are ghettos settled by the Cantonese (southies) starting the late 19th Century.  Until the 1970s, most overseas Chinatowns are small and serve mostly Cantonese food.  In the 80s Canadian immigration from Hong Kong (also Cantonese) took off, Toronto and Vancouver got a massive influx of English speaking Honker professionals, and Montreal got a few from Quebec firms hiring from the same pool.  Then in the 2000s the Mainland Chinese economy took off and you got immigrants from the North of China (Mandarin speakers) come into Quebec with investment dollars - they don't have the home-team language advantage that Cantonese/English speaking immigrants have in their old traditional Chinatowns.  They can't speak English anyways - might as well can't speak French as well.  Hence - the influx of dumplings and noodle joints in Montreal for the past few years.  

Thanks to the Vietnamese Chinese and the mainland influx, 70% of the cuisine in Chinatown are of the Vietnamese/Northern Chinese variety.  Within that 30% that aren't, if it serves Cantonese it's either an offshoot of a Toronto firm (like the bakeries here) or it is old school, like the Dragon Beard candy shop, or Sai Gwan (which has been around for so long my dad said it looked old when he visited Montreal in the 90s). 

Secondly, this is not a Canadian Chinese joint.   Sure it's got the General Tso to sell to morons (the same morons who thinks ordering Chop Suey in Chinatown instead of the local casse-croute Chinois is somehow more \"authentic\" when it clearly isn't), but then if you really look, there are gems from the old Cantonese cookbook.  For example, the double boiler medicinal soups like Underwater Coco and chicken soup, or the Shrimp Caviar noodles (made in-house) served with wontons in a seafood based broth.  It's got a very decent clay pot rice casserole - the kind that features the crispy charred rice bits (pegao) that is often missing from a good casserole of this variety.  Mix the ingredients in, stir in some sweet soy sauce and you're in business.  Now, them being Cantonese you would have to accept a few things.  The wonton will feature shrimp.  Their dumplings will never be Shandong (Northern Chinese) style.  They are not a dimsum palace like Kim Fung, and frankly, they will never be as cheap or serve you as fast.  They will probably have weird ingredients like dried scallops and chicken feet on their menu.  But other than that, they do Cantonese the old school way - which is not to say that they are the best place in Chinatown, but they are the best Cantonese place that is still thriving in Chinatown.  Everyone else either went Northern Chinese or stuck to Canadian Chinese, but they are still holding on.  So they are the winner by default in a race lacking participants.

Sure, the place looks old, but then, so what if it is?   Restaurants in Montreal are constantly dying thanks to its insanely high turnover - a new restaurant implies that they recently opened, and unless they stick around, all that new construction will simply look good next to the \"A Louer\" (For Rent) sign when the starship eatery goes under.  Sai Gwan has gone to the point where they attract a loyal following to keep them running (neighborhood joint), and they no longer need to put up eye candy to satisfy over-privileged millenials.  Hell, I would be alarmed if they renovate - the price tag will jump up and the menu choices will go down.  Who the hell would want that?

Is the food good?  Hells yeah.  Is the service decent?  Sure.  Will I come back here again and again since my first visit in 2011?  Hells yeah.  And so should you."}
{"text":"Had a very enjoyable dinner that started off with a delicious Hong Kong style milk tea, Pork Lo Mein and a Wonton noodle soup as main dishes.

The best was their home made noodles, that remind me of Hong Kong.

The service was great the price was even better.
Definitely recommended. Next time I will try their dim sum.

Cons: little place and decor is minimal"}
{"text":"I got some vegetables and chow mein to go for supper.  Both were swimming in goopy white sauce and were not awesome.  Also, the shrimp was definitely not cooked all the way, to the point where I stopped eating it because I figured I didn't want to risk food poisoning over a mediocre supper.  I will definitely not order the shrimp chow mein again and won't be getting take out from there again any time soon.

I'll give this restaurant one more chance, since I liked it the first time.  To be continued..."}
{"text":"There's always a fine line with hole in the wall restaurants. Will it be good? Inexpensive? \"Authentic\"? Clean (relatively speaking of course) Yes, yes, yes, more or less.

They advertise homemade noodles and dumplings, and the product lives up to that. The wonton stock is flavourful and light on the MSG. I would highly recommend any of the wonton noodle dishes. Dim sum portions are more modest than any big resto dim sum you might expect, but you can take heart that it really was handmade. Any noodle dishes with beef flank also recommended. 

Typically I get hot pot with some combination of Chinese sausage, chicken, mushrooms; this time I ordered the salted fish black bean hot pot, which is okay but not as great as the other choices. 

Don't take your first date here, wait until at least date five. Don't take her parents if you're hoping to impress. You've got a friend who loves discovering great food off the beaten path, take them here."}
{"text":"This restaurant doesn't fool around when it comes to noodles. The wonton noodle soup is serious business here and tastes great every time. The wontons are full-bodied bundles of goodness (and shrimp), the fish balls with curry taste like curry, and their dumplings and dim sum taste made-to-order. I'm looking forward to trying the rice hot pot (20 minutes wait minimum) next time I go for lunch.

Discovered after finding out that this is one of Jason's, of Shut Up and Eat fame, favourite places in Chinatown.

By the way, cash only."}
{"text":"It's a small and inconspicuous restaurant in China town. We really loved Hong Kong milk tea and shrimp wonton noddles. The hot pot rice with sausage/ chicken were great too. It seems Korean stone pot rice. The main dish's price is really reasonable and big portion. Maybe we'll try some dim sum next time."}
{"text":"The food is VERY good ! We were looking for fried dumplings and found this place on Yelp, but were really sceptical seeing the place, it is kind of old and not really attractive. But no disappointment ! We tried the won ton shrimp soup et the porc fried dumplings and they were excellent. Authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall place in a deserted street in Chinatown, they serve old schools Cantonese dishes such as Lo mien, hot pot rice, and wonton noodles. The place looks like an old Chinese diner from the 70s, and it looks like it hasn't changed at all. The food is extremely inexpensive for the quality and the attention to detail, which is surprisingly high considering that it's basically a Chinese fast food place. 

I ordered a shrimp caviar noodles with Beef Brisket lo mien, the noodles were tasty, bouncy, the brisket melted in your mouth and packed with flavour. The noodles are pulled in store, which is quite a treat when they are well done, and this place pulls one of the best in town.

4.5 stars any day.

Really nice service too. Like amazingly friendly."}
{"text":"I love the Wonton Noodle Soup (Wonton Mein) at this place.
I always order the number 12 (Siu Mai) as an appetizer
and number 29 (Wonton Noodle Soup - egg noodle with Cantonese dumpling).
And very inexpensive, too. 
My idea of a perfect lunch!

BTW, it is cash only."}
{"text":"Literally not much more than a hole in the wall located in a neglected corner of Chinatown this restaurant isn't a place to bring business partners, dates, or anybody you are hoping to impress. It's a dingy restaurant that's clearly seen better days and my iron stomach gets a little uneasy every time I step into the place.

While the decor doesn't shine, the food does thanks to the thick sheen of oil on just about everything that comes out of the kitchen.  It's typical Canadian style Chinese food and not a good version.

The one and only thing that is reasonably decent and even worth going back and risking food poisoning for is their selection of rice hot pots. It's a dangerously hot earthenware bowl of cooked rice that has a nice crispy crust on top, then they top it with a juicy stir fry, the sauces flow into and get absorbed by the rice.  It's the perfect choice for a wintry Montreal lunch and is one of the few Chinese dishes where I bypass the chopsticks and head straight for the spoon. Be warned, they take about 15 minutes to cook, but I've never seen them sold anywhere else in Montreal."}
{"text":"Very friendly! Their egg noodle tasted really fresh. I tried there veggies and dumplings as well, and they were very good too!"}
{"text":"Cash ONLY. The empty dining room really should have been a head's up- but the yelp reviews steered me wrong this time. Pan fried dumpling were pretty tasty and so were the shrimp dumplings. The fish balls were pretty yucky and the tea was kind of strange too. Skip this place and check out one of the other more vibrant dim sum places in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the appearances. This place is fantastic. Very tasty food and cooked fresh upon ordering. Dumplings and fish balls are a must."}
{"text":"I've had better for the same price. I had the #50 (soup). The noodles were still raw but I guess if they were squishy and raw it means they used fresh noodles, which is a win. They only take cash. For two people we paid ~$22 which includes tip. Is it a win? You decide. As a tourist, it wasn't the best place to go, but for a cheaper outing with friends could be good. Again, I've had better for the same price range but maybe it was unrepresentative. The servers were so kind which was a huge contrast to what I'm used to!"}
{"text":"This is a Hong Kong dim-sum type restaurant. The deco is pretty old and the hand painting is covered with dust. Please change the painting on the wall. It is probably older than me. 
The food is good. So many choices, and most of them have a pic on the wall to demo. Half of them are Dim sum. Small size can be shared with friends. They offer various special drinks and dessert too. If you want to rest and grab a milk tea this place is good. Not to mention a pokestop is right there around the entrance. 
The noodle is house made and fresh. The soup is too salty for me. Also the fish congee and shrimp dumpling. 
Lose one star for the deco."}
{"text":"Charming hole in the wall restaurant in Chinatown, a few steps east of Saint-Laurent and the rest of the brouhaha on La Gauchetiere. I wish there were a few more of those. This is a great place to go if you are not in a hurry, want to take your time and relax. A good place to eat alone or with a friend. It is very small, so there's not much in terms of privacy, you don't go there if you don't want people to overhear your conversation. However, it's rarely overcrowded and at certain times of the day during the week, you'll have the place for yourself. The lady who's there most of the time - the owner I presume - is super nice and talk in a slow, soft voice. Not much in terms of decor, but it's clean. 

All of the items on the menu are photographed and displayed on the wall inside. The food is always good, reasonably priced. 

Some hot pots on the menu can take a while before being ready (we're talking 30 minutes or so), but they always tell you and there are other options if you don't have the time. As I write this (summer of '16), they are open every day except Wednesday. I'm almost split between telling everyone I know about this place, and keeping this secret little gem for myself. I hope they prosper. I hope this place never closes."}
{"text":"This place must be better known for its excellent tasty food!!!! It's so cheap you'll want to eat more than one dish!!! It's not the prettiest restaurant and it looks a little bit sketchy but the food there is DELICIOUS. Will come back for sure! SO CHEAP."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a very small restaurant, hole-in-the-wall style. A little bit run down but I didn't mind. What's nice is that because they have such an extensive menu, they post pictures of their options on the wall so you can know what to expect.

FOOD: Delicious! The plates are very simple but are your classic cantonese comfort foods. I for one loved it. Their quality and taste are simple but super yummy. Plus, they have a HUGE menu, it took me some time to decide on my meal!

PRICE: I just found my new go-to spot! The prices are inexpensive, especially the noodle dishes. I'd say the range is from 7-12$. 

SERVICE: The main waitress was very nice. She's a little bit quiet but gives off that classic Asian mom vibe which I really enjoyed. She told us how we should proceed with hot dishes and told us the optimal way to enjoy the noodles. I truly hope that they stay in the area for a long time."}
