{"text":"Generally a good place to goto, they have 3 pool tables so unless it's really packed you can get a game in, they open the doors during summer so you can smoke if you want while playing pool"}
{"text":"Read the not recommended reviews. The food is terrible and the staff has bad attitudes."}
{"text":"The food was so good (best hot dog I've ever had) and our server was amazing!!! I'll definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Every time we're at Game on Lakewood, we have a good experience. They have great food, quick & friendly service and a friendly atmosphere. We keep going back."}
{"text":"If you like ketchup with chef boyardi cheese this is the place to go. We waited over an hour for two small pizzas and nachos. The nachos were a joke....gross, soggy beef with no flavor with a few flakes of tomato and cheese. We will never go here to eat again. Save your money!"}
{"text":"This was the second time I've been to Game On and I remembered why I didn't go back right away.  We ordered the fried pickles as an appetizers and I wished they were chips instead of spears. Whatever, they were terrible.  Our table ordered 2 quesadillas, 1 hamburger and a BLT.  The food overall was ok....not even overly good and not memorable, but definitely not something I would recommend to anyone.  One note, I ordered the tots and the waitress came to the table with fries instead and said \"the kitchen screwed up and gave you fries instead that's ok right?\"  Well no....I ordered tots!  Also, my daughter's went to use the restroom and something was happening in there - there were 2 women and a man in the ladies room drinking and I'm not sure what? The guy was drinking a beer and looked at my daughter's and said \"come on in\" - I'm not sure why I didn't report it to the manager or police, I should have but I was in a rush to eat, get out of there and get to the Cavs game.   Game on is a definite Game OFF for me!"}
{"text":"Had s good time up there. I got the Reuben. It was pretty good. The fries were good as well. I wasn't expecting too much from a small bar with just bar food in the menu, but I was very happy with everything. Would recommend to anyone who was looking for a quick, simple meal."}
{"text":"Great bar. They have a lot of TVs and a great patio. perfect for game days."}
{"text":"Great Friendly Staff, Great Wings with alot of Meat on them!! Good onion rings! Take my advice and save some room the Brownie Bites they are AMAZING!!! Fun place to watch  any  your sports, you have TV'S everywhere. Plus they have pool tables  and a Old Tyme Bowling Game!!! Good Times... Good Times!!! Also  look up and around to find a SWEET BASEBALL BAT COLLECTION!!! Good Times!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game and grab some affordable drinks. The food could use some improvement but it will do the trick after a few beers or during a game. The cheesy bacon tots are a must try when you are looking for a less than healthy fill-me-up."}
{"text":"I wish I would have read these reviews before we picked a place to eat:( my husband and I had a date night, live close and want this place to succeed but it's a disaster. On every single level. It took over an hour to get a wrap and chicken strips. Not sure how this is even possible since there were about 5 people in the place. Ugh. Could be something...but isn't."}
{"text":"Mind is made up. Way too inconsistent with their service and with their kitchen times. Not worth going there to wonder if you'll get an A or and F. So many other local and reliable bars with attentive staff. This one's a hard no."}
{"text":"There are a few times in my life when I take the time o write about a bad experience, but this place needs to be put out there. The staff is absolutely horrendous! It's not hard to put on a smile and take a person's order, but apparently it is for this place. I ordered a burger that came out very undercooked! I didn't even eat it for fear of mad cow disease! When I was finally able to order my drink, my first sip made me almost vomit! I don't believe anyone in this place has any experience! To add to the disappointment, the management regarded my complaints with a \"don't let the door hit you on the way out!\" Will never be going back here, so I suggest you don't either!!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure - this is not the kind of bar I usually frequent. Wall full of TVs, pool tables, and a primarily male clientele are not my thing, but I was with friends looking for food and a drink after an Indians game.   Our experience started well. We all ordered beers and water, which came in the expected time. Then our group of 9 ordered food. Our food began to arrive, but one order was wrong and 3 people didn't get their food. The waitress left to correct the order and find out where the missing food was.   We didn't see her again until she brought back only the corrected order. She said something must have messed up with the kitchen as a bunch of orders came in at once. Not many people were eating nor had many people come in since we had. It was at least 15-20 minutes or more before the final 3 orders came - a grilled cheese with fries, mozzarella sticks, and a Reuben with fries. All the rest of us had finished eating by the time their food came.   Most of our group has been a server at one point and  we are very understanding about service, but this was ridiculous. Our server became very scarce and offered no more than one quick \"I'm sorry\" once the issues arose. It's a shame that our service experience was so terrible because none of us will be going back for more of the excellent food we had."}
{"text":"I drive by this place daily and decided to finally give it a try. The environment is great on a nice day--they have an awesome patio that would be perfect to watch any Cleveland team play. They also have a ton of arcade games and a pool table for entertainment. I only interacted with one staff member, and she was super sweet. If it weren't for the patio though I probably wouldn't be going back. The food was disappointing. Granted, I did get a salad which isn't any bars specialty, but I couldn't eat half of it because it was brown. If you're looking for a place to go with a good atmosphere and nothing more than drinks, then this may be a good option."}
{"text":"Great sports bar close by, ever game will be one. Burgers are awesome, wraps are great, cajan wrap is super spicy. Fries are good. Only thing after my several visits I didn't like were the boneless wings."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a friend on Sunday to watch the game.  The person making drinks (it would be a disservice to refer to her as a Bartender) was the rudest person I have ever encountered behind a bar.  I ordered two drinks, a Jameson and a vodka.  She promptly poured two vodkas and proceeded to argue with me that I had ordered wrong.  I patiently explained that I only drink jameson and that that is what I had ordered and requested that she correct the order.  She began yelling and pointing and screaming for me to never come in again and that I would never get another drink from her again.  The barback came over and took an agressive stance and began yelling at me as well.  I politely explained that the rude female had made a mistake and was being inappropriate. At some point, several management types came over and sent the female drink mistaker into the kitchen after I observed her downing a second shot of fireball since my arrival. I cashed out and though I deeply wanted to zero out the credit card,  tip line, I left a tip because there were several other bartenders working that had been polite and were working hard.  My friend and I left. The manager applogized halfheartedly and allowed me to pay my full tab and leave a very unhappy customer. On the way to my car, the barback came out onto the street and was overheard calling the police to report my driving.  A Lakewood officer veered around the corner and followed me for several blocks.  It wasnt a problem because I had only had the two rather weak drinks and he peeled off shortly.   Along with the two managers, I also discovered the owner was present and witnessed much of this.  Collectively,  none of them handled or controlled a situation that never should have happened.  If I could give the place zero stars I would.  A simple mistake that was pointed out politely was greeted with agression and hostility.  Certainly myself and a fairly large group of friends who have been looking for a new meeting place will not be returning."}
{"text":"Been here before for a Cavs finals game it was a good time but I tried to come on a saturday around 130 for lunch and left after sitting there for 5 minutes no employee approached us and the bartender had the nerve to ask us of we wanted to see a menu as we were walking out"}
{"text":"Beer prices and selection are reasonable. Biggest complaint is with the staff. Went there with friends to watch college football. Granted we are Michigan alums in Ohio but as paying customers (and the only customers in the bar mind you) we didn't expect to have our allegiance to our school mocked or get flipped off by the bartender or told \"Michigan sucks\". We weren't causing a scene or disturbance. I'm all for friendly banter but once a bartender flips you off as she's walking out for a smoke it's over the top. Definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, tons of tvs with sports on, good crowd on a Saturday evening. But....good luck getting a drink. there were plenty of pretty girls behind the bar that walked right by while I'm calling out for a refill. What I mostly didn't like was the type of crowd...a lot of cocky guys walking around, bumping into you and not a sorry or even a look back to acknowledge you. A little courtesy and service would go a long way for this place. So if you are a twenty something muscle head looking for fresh meat...this is your place!"}
{"text":"We live right near this place and desperately want to love it since we work late and their kitchen stays open, but all the bartenders hate their job and their customers. We have been in 4 different times, 4 different days of the week and had the same experience each time- Bartender comes over, tosses coasters, doesn't say hello, and grabs drinks without a word, then disappears. It's a shame because the location and layout of the place are great, but other reviewers are 100% right, stay away, go to the Plank Road Tavern, which is the runaway best spot in Lakewood, and let this place run its course until something decent takes over. I genuinely can't believe it has lasted as long as it has. I would rather go to work than take a free paid day off if it was under the condition that I had to go to Game On."}
{"text":"Solid bar atmosphere and food.  Went for a hot dog and solid.  Good price and quality.  Service was good and not a bad place to grab a bit."}
{"text":"I was at Game On in Lakewood Monday and had a really fun time. They had on a ton of sports which I appreciate but the also had on Robot Chicken!  I love that show!  Everyone there was cracking up, how refreshing to go into a place that isn't afraid to be different than all the other sports bars out there...I stayed a lot longer  than i had intended and enjoyed more beers than I had anticipated because I was being entertained"}
{"text":"This place is perfect if you're looking for a sports bar to watch your favorite team at. They've got a a bunch of TVs and they have timers set to change the TV to whatever game is scheduled for the evening. It can be moderately annoying to get a different game turned on and I've had some trouble from the staff getting a game on that they hadn't scheduled to have on.   There are some arcade games, pool tables, and bubble hockey, so there's lots of games to challenge your friends to when you're taking a break from the TV screens.  The menu is not very extensive and consists of typical bar foods. I've seen a lot of people end up trying their tater tots which are relatively cheap for a basket full. I've had a couple of their wraps and sandwiches but nothing particularly stands out. This place is better known for showcasing the day's sports games than for their food options."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. It is by far my favorite sports bar that I've found in Ohio. I am from San Francisco, and they are never rude about playing Warriors or Sharks games (here usually people are). Plus, there's a ton of tvs, so everyone can watch what they want. They have good drink deals, and extra large pints (I think it's larger than a pint but Idk what they're called). There is a whole separate area for playing pool. The staff are usually very nice; there's one brunette bartender who can be very rude if you're not a guy and not hitting on her.  There is also an older guy who is awesome. I've never tried the food, but the deep fried brownie bites are amazing."}
{"text":"I like Game On for the cheap beer and tator tots. They always have 2.75 pounders (bud light, Miller lite, etc.) and usually have a decent special. I believe they always have a $3 beer of the month that is 22 ounces, which is a great deal. Last time I went, it was Labatt.       I've tried several different food options here. Like I said, I love the tator tots and always get them as my side instead of fries, although those are tasty too. You can get tots by them self (with or without cheese and/or bacon) in half or full orders. I suggest the half order for 2 people or less. It comes with a lot! I've also had burgers which are decent and you create your own. My usual go to meal is the buffalo chicken wrap. I get it with crispy chicken and you can choose your sauce. However, I STRONGLY suggest getting it without bleu cheese or getting it on the side. Even if you are a fan of it, it is beyond overwhelming and all you will taste. I usually get ranch instead.       Of all the times I have been here, I have always had an issue with the service. The only steady bartender I've seen that sticks around and is good is named Randy. All of the other ones seem to come and go pretty regularly, never know the specials, and will stand there and do anything but serve you. I've stood at the bar and made eye contact with bartenders who then begin cleaning or some other task, which makes me furious. The one time I sat at an actual table we ended up getting our own food and drinks from the bar because he was so slow to come check on us.       If you're looking for somewhere cheap to watch a game, Game On is definitely your place. They always have every game on and have an almost overwhelming amount of TVs. Just don't expect quick service if the place is even remotely crowded."}
{"text":"Me and a group of guys went there around 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon. We were looking to get some lunch and a couple beers, it looks like they have a great patio with some pool tables and a bubble hockey machine. We walked in and asked if we could sit on the patio, but as we approached the bar there were two guys just completely hammered drunk. They were obnoxious and followed us to the patio. We figured they would just go back to the bar so we ordered some drinks but they kept hanging around. One of us walked in and asked the bartender to see if they could do something but all she said was \"they aren't going to leave.\" Well that made our decision easy and we decided to leave. It was I tough to understand why they wouldn't just ask the guys to settle down or leave but instead they lost 5 paying customers looking to order food and beers....tough to say I would go back..."}
{"text":"Opened a \"yelp\" account just to review this place.  Bf and I ordered a beer, a shot and burgers. When I came back from the bathroom,  my beer was replaced by water and the bartender/manager was talking about me to a coworker. Juvenile behavior.  We got our burgers to go and left.  The burgers were gray and tasteless. Awful food. Awful service. Can't wait to see what follows it in a couple months. Game off lakewood. And apparently they hide their bad reviews rather than focusing on fixing their issues."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this spot.. Right around the corner from my apt. But yeah, you can't get a drink in here, even when bar is mostly empty and there are more bartenders than patrons. Tried it twice! Both times staff was rude- like we were putting them out. The wings were super shitty. Small, overpriced, overcooked. When we asked for ranch, you would have thought we asked the girl for a huge personal favor. Awesome that it came quite awhile later.. You want cold wings with that? I honestly didn't even wanna rip the bartenders since they acted like they were so annoyed and ignored us so many times. I did, but reluctantly.   Come on now! You have a prime spot, great setup and you have lame bartenders and shitty food? Just because you think they look cute in their mid-drift t-shirts?? This place is going the way of the 'Stache.  Giving it a star for the awesome tvs and setup. And I would give more points for the great beers on tap, but when no one is serving them, who cares??"}
{"text":"It was awesome service, I was greeted right away and the food was amazing! I would definitely recommend it to anyone !"}
{"text":"The selection was great overall a nice bar. But after a drink and a shot I said something along the lines of I hope this drink doesn't cost me $11 and the bartender placed my drink in front of me and said \"I'm going to have to cut you off\".  She then pulled the drink and put it behind the bar. Which I respected. New bar trying to be strict or whatever they want to say to justify it.   I went to the next bar down the street who served me happily . What I can't tolerate is my friends telling me that such bartender was talking badly about me after I left where they could hear her. And she also re-served my drink to somebody else. They then left and met me down at the other bar with a message from the other bartending working to apologize for the behavior of the other bartender."}
{"text":"Time/Day 7pm Saturday (Memorial Day Weekend)  If there were a 1.5 star, this place would get that. It's not horrible, but it wasn't really good. With every other place we looked being very crowded, the fact that we hadn't tried it and it didn't look crowded made it appealing. Sometimes there isn't a crowd for a reason.   We ordered from the very limited food menu: Tater tots, Cod bites,Chicken Sandwich, , motz sticks and wings. How hard can it be?  1) The tater tots were over-salted and greasy. When I said something, she had them remake an order of tots with no seasoning... so they were just greasy. 2)Cod bites overcooked. They were pre-bagged frozen that was pretty obvious, and so over-breaded and overcooked that there were but a few flakes of fish in each one. Mostly they were greasy breaded bites with the \"Tartar Sauce\" ... honest to God it was cold mayo in a plastic cup with 1 or 3 pickle dots in it to I guess make  it tartar-y?  3) The chicken sandwich was 2 breaded tenders, canned mushrooms and a piece of cheese on a bun. I had to ask for some lettuce to give it a bit of moisture and then also put mayo on it for more moisture and taste.  4) Motz sticks, also over-salted 5) There didn't seem to be much complaint about the wings. Dinner companion said the sweet chili sauce was good, but hey, sauce comes out of a jar or can, and this person is rather indiscriminate about food, so his opinion may or may not be helpful.   I should note that while we were at the bar eating, one of the bartenders was on the phone apologizing to a caller and asking if they could remake something or another. That kind of says a lot considering this night, our food wasn't any good. Maybe the \"good chef\" was off for the holiday. I say that sarcastically because this isn't a place you go expecting gourmet. It's fryer food... bar food... just not very good bar food.   Gals behind the bar were friendly enough and fairly attentive, though again, nothing outstanding. There was one waitress that was behind the bar saying how Xbossguy was an asshole lol ha ha, and maybe I'm just getting too old for the sports bar scene because while I wasn't \"offended\" I just thought it was unprofessional, as was some guy obviously known or related to someone, who came behind the bar and was pitching quarters to see if he could hit this or that. I guess maybe if I was 20 again and getting drunk with a group of friends I might be saying, \"Alright man! Woo-hoo you got that!\" but I'm just trying to eat here, okay?  Overall, we won't go back.   But on a good note, while we were there, the Indians beat the Orioles to take singular first place for the first time in 3 years. Thanks Tribe for being the bright spot in this otherwise forgettable visit."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times to watch some games and in my opinion its your typical sports bar. Lots of tvs, a pool table, large bar, and great bar food. I've gotten the fried pickles and the wings with the buffalo ranch sauce and loved both of them. They add some dill into their batter for the fried pickles and I feel like it gives them and extra kick that I don't see in a lot of other restaurants. As for the wings I initially didn't think I would like a ranch buffalo sauce but my boyfriend convinced me to try it and I'm glad he did. The buffalo is a little spicy so the ranch cools it down a bit. The wings are cooked well with a juicy inside and a nice crisp skin. Another thing I like about this place is that they have an outside patio. They aren't too far from my house so we like to walk here when its nice out and sit out on the patio and have a beer."}
{"text":"The service is terrible!  Waited 15 minutes to even get my drink.  Asked for a Manhattan and the bartender had no idea how to make it.  So, then decided to make it simple and asked him for a Jack Daniel's straight up.  He brings it back ON THE ROCKS??!!  While I sat at the bar noticed the chubby lady that manages the place just sat there at the end of the bar while the bartenders could not keep up with being consistent serving drinks.  It's not like she can't loose a few pounds, but instead just sits there!  The bar has a real nice set up, but NONE of the employees are even professional bartenders nor servers.  In a nice establishment like this...you would think they would have better quality employees all the way up to management.  Not worth visiting."}
{"text":"If you want to enjoy the televisions and pool tables you should just wait a few months until this place closes and a new one that has capable management takes its place."}
{"text":"Came in for grand opening. I had a great experience. Place looks nice. I wasn't in here when it was the Stache. So I don't know what upgrade they did. The patio area looks like a great summer spot with the garage doors open. Bunch of tvs with game packages. Spring games were on. Decent beer selection. GLBC, Sweet Water, Left Hand etc. on draft. prob about 30 diff bottles.  Amber was bartending. She was great and the manager was more than willing to come answer my questions about the menu. Ended up ordering a cheeseburger. The burgers are on the menu as a steak burger. I would agree that they are. The meat was under-seasoned. But I wasn't missing it. The meat was very flavorful and extremely juicy. Good fat content. Got a total of 8 steak fries.  Would have liked 10 but My belly won't complain about that.   So I ordered. Single order of tots. With a side of spicy mayo. Nice amount of tots and the spicy mayo was on point. Pretty sure it was just mayo and cajun seasoning, none the less it was tasty and complimentary to the tots.  They have some kinks to work out, but it was day 1. So, definitely one of the better grand openings I've been too, so five stars. ill be back."}
{"text":"Ordered the double burger, which came with about a pound of fresh cut french fries! I really liked the food and the bartender was extremely attentive. Will definitely go back!"}
