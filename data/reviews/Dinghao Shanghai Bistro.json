{"text":"Being a Chinese descendant and have traveled around the world. This is your best bet in AZ or at least in Gilbert/Mesa/Chandler area.  The food is excellent and service is great along with its price.   Some dishes might be on the saltier side so just remind the server be easy on salt when you order.  Love this place"}
{"text":"Staff did not honor certificate for take out order even though it was not specifically mentioned. When shown certificate and another certificate that specifically indicated dine in only they said sorry but still not accept it.  So much for first time and we purchased well over the amount."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to dine out. I come here regularly since it is very close to where I live. The boss is very friendly and the food is great! They have taste Shanghai style food and their Szechwan style food is also very good. I will definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. It was our first time to the restaurant and the boss showed his kindness. We planned to order four dishes, and finally ended up with 6. One of the them was free. I don't like the cold dishes, but the hot food is great! I miss the southern Chinese food (especially Shanghai food) for a long time because I came from Shanghai. I am so glad I went there.  And two days after, we went there again. Sure it will become my first choice later on."}
{"text":"Very authentic Shanghai style restaurant, a taste of my hometown?highly recommended! ??????????"}
{"text":"This is truly a great restaurant. the chef here is cooking with big flavors, garlic, scallion infused oils, the Shanghai style thick noodles, like chewy udon, were full of flavor. The xiaolongbao, unfortunately, were not, although this was made up for by the hongyou chaoshou, wonton dumplings submerged in a spicy red chili garlicky oil, and the lion's head meatballs braised in a savory brown sauce, redolent of star anise."}
{"text":"Xiaolong bao!!!  Wonderful. Had a fabulous meal and a lesson in the proper use of chop sticks, which I failed miserably. And they still liked me. I will be going back there again and again. And the Grandmother's braised pork melted in my mouth! Prices were very fair. Atmosphere was friendly. Go there. You'll like it!"}
{"text":"I ordered food from them through grub hub. Food came on time. I am in love with two distinct dishes when ordering from chinese. 1.mu shu pork. Done correctly,  the thin wraps, and the plum sauce with the standard ingredients is outstanding. In fact, I love the plum sauce so much, I probably overdue it and run out close to the 4th thin wrap. As a precaution,  I tell them extra plum sauce. Then I am sure I can slather away without running out. I paid $28 for this meal, so if they wanted to charge me for the extra plum sauce, that would have been  fine. 2 . the second favorite I order when getting chinese food, is walnut chicken. I had never eaten from this restaurant before, but ordering these two dishes, can pretty much tell me their level of expertise . This dish had the white sauce slathered on it, ( most places serve on the side so you can warm it up and control how much you put on it yourself). Shrimp and gooey white sauce were almost room temperature.  All in all, the food was unimpressive, one order wrong leaving out the key ingredient plum sauce. Just an all around lousy, bland experience. Obviously,  NEVER ordering their slop again. Anyone can do better in hundreds of other Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I'm from Phoenix and lack the depth and breadth of hole-in-the-wall cultural experiences that someone from say San Francisco might have. However, this place makes me feel as though my life experience is more complete.   If you didn't know to look for DingHao you'd miss it. Further, if you didn't specifically ask for the Chinese menu you would miss many of the true gems this place offers. But, once you've cleared those hurdles you are rewarded with very tasty xiao long bao. Some may say that the xiao aren't as good as in Shanghai but I don't live in Shanghai so I'm very happy to patronize DingHao whenever I'm in the east valley."}
{"text":"Changed ownership and kitchen staff. NOT Shanghainese food!! There aren't any soup dumplings and half of the items listed on the menu are not available because they did not update the menu. It is mainly Central & and a bit Northern Style Chinese cooking.  All 4 of the main dishes ordered taste the same and was drenched in chili-oil, MaLa Style. That means the dishes are spicy and you should expect to get the numbing effect after each bite because the sauce is made primarily of dried chili peppers, chili powder, dou-ban (bean) paste, peppercorns, clove, star anise, cardamom, fennel and ginger.  Scallion pancakes were not crispy and not cooked thoroughly, no taste, sight and no flavor of scallions. Disappointedly the pancake just heavy, thick and oily as opposed to light, aromatic and crispy. The pan fried pork dumplings also had thick, mushy skin. The meat filing tastes old and unrecognizable. My first time not Gobbling up pan fried dumplings! Salt and Pepper shrimp was decent, crispy but not enough salt and pepper seasoning. The shrimp was obviously frozen and tasted old. Even the complimentary rice was old and cold, not warm and fluffy how rice should be.  Another thing to consider is if you don't speak Mandarin, good luck. Lastly, the restaurant is cold and dirty.  Not worth going unless you ONLY want to eat MaLa Style cooking."}
{"text":"Update of my 10/2014 experience. Ohhh nooooo Mr. Bill!  The folks who opened this after Jade Palace were superb chefs and service was excellent. But, suddenly a new crew appeared, and now, good lord, the chef(s) seem to produce pretty poor fare, and some of the staff has no clue what they are doing. This really hurts. A nice family, and I so want you to succeed, but this is really serious. Folks, please, if you don't wake up you are going to fail. Find out how the previous \"new owners\" cooked such great food. Please, my heart aches for you."}
{"text":"My third time here. After opened for almost a month, They just applied some discounts on their menu recently! And they are serving smaller version of couple big dishes now! So sweet! Everything is improving, and the staff is asking for suggestion. I will still say this restaurant is sort of unique, different from those cantonese/taiwanese/szechwuan restaurant. No harm to have a try"}
{"text":"Great tasting food and large portions a little too heavy on the sauce. Also if youre ordering soup togo watch out they dont stack the soup and ask for individual bags because the plastic lid will cave in and ruin your soup like it did mine:("}
{"text":"It was really great! I had egg foo for the first time and loved it. Along with walnut prawns, steam buns, rice, etc. All were great."}
{"text":"I ordered duck soup and Szechwuan style boiled fish and beef. The dishes are very traditional. The food are fresh and very delicious!"}
{"text":"I ordered from the Eat24 app as I have a few times before.. the delivery time indicated around an hour.  At an hour and a half I called.. it was \"on the way\". 5 minutes later they called and clarified my beverage order.  Clearly not enroute.  Almost two hours from order time the lady arrived and told me they were out if Sprite but had included \"something more expensive\"...a tiny can if chunky mango juice.  Ewwww.  Tardy happens ...honesty is a practice."}
{"text":"0-3 stars for food 0-2 stars for service  First impression was great!  Family sharing food off to the right and they looked happy.   I was doing takeout and was greeted by 2 females. The awkward moment came when I had to ask for a menu,they didn't even ask if I wanted to eat here or takeout.   They don't have lunch specials on the weekend but that wasn't stated on the menu.   Different sizes of meals and appetizers not listed on menu  They gave 2 free egg rolls with the meal but they are bitter and soggy on the inside.  It also has a smokey taste  I got home and they didn't even give me my wallet shrimp. After digging through everything it turns out that they gave me wonton soup.  The crab puffs are greatly filled but it's not crab.  Not even imitation crab.  It's more liquid that came out of a piping bag.   I was hungover and didn't want to deal with it anymore. I drove by the place.  Dropped off the soup and went somewhere else.   0 - the food because I didn't get what I ordered and the crab puffs had 0 crab in it.   0 - they got my order wrong and didn't offer me a menu.   I can't give a 0 so 1 star it is"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Maybe because I didn't find the \"soup dumpling\"  tried the spicy wonton and the capella wonton, both soup.  The broth was great.  Also got scallion onion pancakes, very crispy but lack taste.  The bbq pork chow mein, crispy noodles was unexpectedly good.  They offer sweet soy milk, which tasted fresh not powder with hot water add.    Waitress was really nice and patience with us.  She tried her best to explain the menu.  I don't expect to return but if am in the neighborhood I wouldn't oppose it the idea."}
{"text":"the xiao long bao aka soup dumpling ... does not have any soup Inside the dumplings. they're r just steamed dumplings...  service is OK... taste of the dumplings was bland ..."}
{"text":"The New Times article, \"10 Best Things I ate in 2015\",  Volume 46, led me to try Dinghao.  The author of the article said that their dish, \"sheng jian boa\" or steam buns were delicious--  broth and pork-filled buns.  Sounded amazing so I headed for Dinghao.  Unfortunately, my eating companion doesn't eat pork so I opted to try other dishes. Here's what we had:  Green onion pancakes:  Arrived so saturated in grease that they glistened from the oil.  When I told the waitress I couldn't eat them because they were too greasy, she went to the back and got me a pile of napkins. Really?  She expected me to soak up pancakes that were super saturated in fat?  I told her I didn't want them.  She came back a few minutes later with a new batch that looked better but still greasy.  I would not order them again. Vegetable spring rolls:  Small, not too greasy with cabbage inside.  Not worth the calories. Schezwan Noodles:  We asked if these were like cold sesame noodles and were told yes.  A small portion of noodles arrived with a brownish paste and bean sprouts.  Not exactly what we expected, didn't wow us and would not order it again.   Vegetable fried rice:  Large portion, with visible pieces of broccoli, peas and carrots.  Not very flavorful.  A little sesame oil would have made the difference.  Would not order it again. Spicy Shrimp:  Generous portion, about 11 shrimp with heads and shells on. Fresh and delicious.  At $12.95 I thought it was a good value.  I would eat this again. Chicken with Broccoli:  My companion tried to get Orange Chicken made with un-breaded chicken.  The waiter insisted that it couldn't be done which we could not understand considering that Chicken with Broccoli is made with un-breaded chicken.  He settled for chicken with broccoli and asked that it be prepared very, very, very spicy.  The waiter said that this dish is not usually spicy but that they would spice it up.  I chimed in that he liked it super spicy so not to be afraid to spice it up.  Nevertheless, the dish arrived without any spice and on top of that, it was over-salted.   Enough said.  I think you guys get the idea.   Too bad I didn't try the steam buns during this visit because it definitely will be my last.   '"}
{"text":"This place is really good, and affordable came in for the $5.50 lunch special and we weren't disappointed. This place is amazing and has the best hot and sour and egg drop soup I've ever had. The mongolian beef and honey mustard chicken were perfect! If you like traditional food you have to come eat at this place!"}
{"text":"A little dubious coming to small Chinese owned restaurants I was actually surprised by the authenticity of the Shanghai food here! Typical restaurants like these are not the best in decor nor ambience but probably closely resembles that of the crowded Los Angeles inner cities asian-owned restaurants.   We asked the cook for some recommendations and was recommended the following:  Cold dishes: - spongy tofu with peanuts. This is an acquired texture for those that are not so adventurous with foods. - Shanghai style cold simmered duck. Cooked like it was hot this is the cold version of it. Tastes the same but there is an inclination to the cold taste of cooked duck. You just have to try it for the sake of it.   Hot dishes: - fish filet noodle soup with pickled cabbage = this has a bit of spiciness. Simple noodles with the white fish fillets and pickled cabbage in a spicy-based broth.  - xiao long bao (steamed buns) = 8 pork filled soup dumplings encased with a thin bun wrap laid on a steamed cabbage to keep its moisture. Dip this in the soy sauce, vinegar and ginger sauce to give it the complete taste. One of my seeking foods to find and devour.  - capsella wonton soup = wow! This is quite delicious due to the translucent wonton with pork meat inside. With each bite the flavors burst throughout. These translucent wontons swim in the seaweed based soup with just enough seasonings to drink the whole bowl of soup - of one wanted to.   I would definitely come back for the capsella wontons and the xiao long bao. And of course, I'm down to try new dishes! Happy eating! :D"}
{"text":"Poor Business  I purchased a $5 off certificate from restaurant.com to try this place out. I used their online orsering system which was highly convenience since I work in the area and need it ready quickly. When I got there,  they said they were no longer accepting those coupons. Restaurants.com coupons NEVER expire; refusing them is a contractual violation. Plus, they are arguing over 5 freaking dollars and upsetting a new customer. They wouldn't budge on the discount so I did not take the food. So now they lost a potential repeat customer, wasted food and lost out on the money I would have paid for the meal. That's an INCREDIBLY STUPID business decision. So, I have no idea how good the food is and I will never find out."}
{"text":"When I approached the restaurant, it appears sketchy. The place is small and dirty. It is a type of restaurant to order food and get out. The service is pretty bad. The only positive side was the braised pork. In my opinion, everything is over pickled and has too much vinegar. It was to a point my mouth was numb. Finally, the worst part is ordering fish fillet with black bean sauce. The result was fish fillet with tofu with pickled sweet and sour sauce. The owner pulled a fast one and talked to the cooks and tried to convince us it has black beans in it. I am pretty sure I know what the difference of black bean sauce. I would NOT recommend this place."}
{"text":"OMG so worth the drive from Old Town Scottsdale! This was the best \"orange chicken\" I have had anywhere in AZ!! I went for the Fried Steam Buns, if I could have only ate more, I would have kept ordering. Everything was so good, I got so caught up in the food I forgot to take a pic of the food. I am so looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with Mom and we will definitely be back! The dumplings in chili oil were delicious, as were the Xialong baos (soup dumplings)! They don't have as much soup in them as I would like but decent by AZ. standards. Come here for authentic Shanghai dishes, as well as the more westernized dishes like sweet and sour pork, orange chicken if that is what you prefer. However, it never hurts to broaden your horizons. You will not be disappointed. Try something that is way out of your comfort zone, it may just surprise you!"}
{"text":"After reading these reviews I was sadly disappointed. The fact that no Asians were eating there when I was should have been a clue.  The food was absolutely the worst excuse for Chinese I have ever had the displeasure of not being able to finish. I suppose there are trade offs. The old Jade House had great food but terrible service. This place has terrible everything. I give them 6 months max and they will be done unless they hire a new kitchen staff."}
{"text":"I ordered a delivery and when it arrives, the food is all messed up. Even the vinegar is fallen to the other dishes. The taste is just normal and for more excessively, I found they charged me twice with two different amount of dollars. Lol, will never go there or order from them again. :)"}
{"text":"We came at 5:30 on a Tuesday evening and we were the only customers at the time.  Our waitress was very attentive and friendly, but spoke very little English.  The restaurant is rather small but nicely decorated.  It is north of a Walgreens pharmacy and just south of the McDonalds and directly across the street from a Subway and a Tattoo shop on Alma School Rd.    We ordered off of both the regular and the Chinese menu.  Started with fried Potstickers, juicy, large and flavorful. Next came Pork Egg Fu Yong which had a nice flavor and lots of pork piled on top but some how was very difficult to cut, and Twice Cooked Pork which had a lot of tender very thin slices of pork, onions, red  hot little peppers, some ginger and other chinese veggies.  Although I asked for it to be spicy it had little heat to it.  The fortune cookies were quite fresh, sweet and crispy. I have taken away a star from the food.  The very friendly owner/chef came out to see how we liked the food and with his very broken English promised he would make some wonderful dishes for us next time!  We will probably return to try some other menu items ."}
{"text":"I bought gift certificates from resturants.com the manager told the waitress he didn't know why I had them and where I got it from. They also told me I had to get cash so I had to jump in my car and go across the street get cash out from Safeway come back and pay them. Believe if my kids were not hungry I would have left! The last chinese resturant closed down that own the building if they continue to do crazy things like this they will too!! TOTALLY OUTRAGEOUS!"}
{"text":"Reccomended: $1 ?? (soy bean milk - hot or cold) with ?? (Chinese fried bread) and ??? (onion \"pancakes\") make a fantasic and extremely affordable breakfast. The latter two come out hot, crispy, and flaky, which is absolutley perfect.   The \"small dish\" menu can be a bit difficult to go through as its in Chinese, but there is an abbreviated menu in Enlish as well.  There is also the ????? (Shang Hai rice cakes) which comes stir fried with meat.  The texture is deliciously chewy and the sauce is flavorful. I always get the ??? xiao long bao which are little dumplings with soup inside.  While this is no Din Tai Fung, it doesn't get much better than this for xlbs in Az.  Piping hot in a bamboo steamer, these go best with the ginger and vinegar/soy sauce.  Don't forget to ask for the sauce as the waiters sometimes forget to bring it out.    Not recommended: ???? Chengdu cold noodles taste a bit like vingegar peanut butter noodles.  Definetly not a fan. Also if you don't particularly like ?? or Sichuan peppercorns, I'd think twice about ordering spicy dishes here.   Pros: super cheap eats.  Reminds me of the causal local eateries in China. Great for brunch.  Some good authentic food.   Cons: caters to very Chinese crowds.  It maybe intimidating to walk in to Chinese menus in the wall.  Additionally, noodle soups tend to be too spicy or salty (though the noodle texture is quite good)."}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food in the Valley. The lunch special I a real value.  Traditional and American menu. The green onion pancakes are especially good.   This dish is good with a side of the pan fried dumpling sauce for dipping. Double thumbs up for this restaurant"}
{"text":"I hate to give low reviews for mom and pop shops.  But the service was terrible!!!  Ok, there was 8 of us for dinner.  We ordered a crap load of food.  Each dish came with no spoons or extra pair of chopsticks, so we can share.  We asked a few times for spoons each dish.  UGH!  When we were ordering the young server either seemed she was disinterested or not getting it.  We even had folks at our table that spoke Chinese.  COME on MAN!  Had to ask for enough waters and check on our drinks.  Review my pics, we ordered green onion pancakes, dumplings, soup dumplings, stir fried rice cakes, braised beef, spicy noodle soups, clear noodles, cold chicken, etc.  They ran out of the steamed fried dumplings.    The best tasting dish was the shanghai stir fried rice cake noodles.  The worse was the deep fried dumplings."}
{"text":"The service ain't the best -- typical and to be expected at an authentic Chinese restaurant. I am Chinese so believe me on this one.   But the food. The food is authentic and really good. We ordered a sautéed green bean dish with fried pork. Noms. We also had XLB (xiao long bao aka steamed pork buns). Finished these suckers. And a spicy Szechuan style fish filet and tofu dish. Really yummy all over white rice!   Oh and also -- they have the cutest delivery driver! Say hi to him!"}
{"text":"Food poisoning. Ate there last night and have been to the bathroom 20+ times since. I feel like garbage. Will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"Good solid cheap Chinese food. I have had both delivery and pickup. Delivery was pretty quick, and they didn't miss anything from the order! Will definitely order regularly from here. Their BBQ pork slices and moo shu are really good!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little authentic Shanghai and Sichuan based restaurant.  Our family (from Shanghai) has been coming here for years and this is about as authentic as it gets! I would recommend the spongy tofu and peanuts, xiao longbao, rice cakes (patties?) and the garlic a-Choy. The service is decent, the place is clean, the food comes fast, and the prices are great!"}
{"text":"They gave me dirty chopsticks so I courteously asked for a fork and the guy and the server insultingly laughed in front of me as if I don't know how to use chopsticks. The stainless steel fork that they gave me was also dirty so I asked for a disposable plastic fork and used that the entire time. Almost walked out but I just held myself. Don't want to stoop down to their level. Very poor service. As much as we want to help them because they're a local mom and pop restaurant but these people are not even happy that you're there instead they insult their customers."}
{"text":"Truly authentic Chinese dishes.  My favorite is the water boiled fish which may be 3 alarm fire for some but I find incredible.  They also make delicious Xiao Long Bao which are dumplings with pork and delicious soup all in one tasty package.  I have never had anything I didn't love here."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this restaurant a 5 star so far.    Pros: - Yummy Mandarin food.  Better than Taiwan House in Mesa. - Portions are reasonable. - My mom had previously been here and recommended they put in Lazy Susans on their bigger tables.  They did it. - Clean - Reasonable service  Cons: - Staff speaks very little English, but you can point. - It would be nice to have pictures in their menu since they speak little English - Place is small - Parking area is awkward, or can be.  But I guess that's because of the location of the restaurant at the end of the strip mall (the north side).  I'm Chinese and it's hard to find a good Mandarin food place here in the east valley.  And it's not too far from where we are often, so this is good.  We ordered the green onion cake, rice cake noodles, Shanghai style noodles, dumplings, a steamed dumpling, and a fish plate.  My Mandarin is broken, so the guy had trouble understanding me and he did not speak Cantonese.  But, somehow I was able to convey most of the dishes we wanted until my mom came, who speaks fluently in Mandarin was able to order the rest.  The young Chinese man was very introverted, but he was friendly, but not like white person friendly.  So, for an authentic Chinese place, it's a 5 star.  Now, I think they have some things confused on their display of names on their restaurant window front.  Everything is Egg Fu Yung or something like that.  I don't know why they put that, as that's not really a Chinese thing, but a Gringo's thing.  So, they definitely need someone who understands and speaks English well to help them there.  So glad that we came here instead of Tao, because maybe for take out, it's fine, but if I have to listen to the male owner use swear words and talk nasty to people, that would be just way too much.  Besides, this was my mom's birthday, and myself, and 2 of my siblings and their families were able to join my mom on her birthday.  We ate in a comfortable, quiet atmosphere that was very pleasant.  No need to worry about some guy talking loudly and rudely to people.    I will personally be taking my husband and kids here to eat.  Communication may be a problem, but I took pictures of the food we ate today, so I can use that."}
{"text":"We stopped here one day to have a meal before heading to the airport. The food was so terrible that I decided I would prefer to eat airport food! The overall quality and freshness of the food, especially the meat, was very poor. In fact, we could not bring ourselves to eat one of the chicken dishes. Fortunately, they ended up removing the charge for that particular dish, which was very kind of them.  (That is the reason I gave them 2 stars instead of one.) The only thing that was decent was the steamed dumpling appetizer. Given the other 5-star reviews, I may reconsider trying this place again, as it is possible we went on an off day. However, given my one experience eating here, I would definitely not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is the place that I've dreamt of for oh-so long. After the closing of my beloved Jade House, I wondered how any restaurant could ever fill the hole in my heart. Ladies and gentlemen, I am SO glad to announce... that restaurant has come.  ... and it's in the exact same location as Jade House used to be. Seriously. How baller is that.  This place has everything that I love in a Chinese restaurant- decent white-people Chinese food, an AMAZING array of authentic Chinese food, and a minimum amount of incredulity when a white guy order from the authentic Chinese menu. Seriously- they handed us the regular menu, and when I asked for the actual Chinese menu they barely even so much as batted an eyelash.   The food was PHENOMENAL. Exactly what I would have hoped for. I've eaten twice there now, and I can't wait to order from them again and try new stuff. The authentic menu can be a little imposing since there aren't too many descriptions for the dishes (everything has an English name, but usually it's just sort of a guess as to what the dish will actually be like) so I recommend going with someone more experienced if this is your first time as a place like this. But you SHOULD go. Try new things- broaden your horizons, open up your world, and GET DOWN WITH YO' BAD SELF!!!!  Grandma's Marinated Pork will make your kneecaps clap, by the by."}
{"text":"I found this place on Google for Chinese Food delivery. It's only a few miles down the road from me. I called and ordered three things. Two lunch specials and bbq spare ribs appetizer. I was told It would be admit thirty minutes. An hour goes by, I call and ask where the food was. Lady assured me driver was out and delivering. Almost two hours later I called again because no one had shown up. I had to argue with the woman to cancel my order and refund my money. She wanted to give me free food for next order. Like i would order from here again? She finally agreed to refund my money. Literally thirty seconds after we had hung up, the driver arrived. I told him I cancelled because he was two hours late and to leave. He assured me the food was hot. Yeah right. I closed the door and heard him screaming outside of my house into his phone. NEVER ORDER DELIVERY HERE."}
{"text":"NEVER NEVER NEVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE!!! I ordered on Eat24.com and Dinghao promised delivery in 45-60 minutes. After 1.5 hours I called Eat24 who called them - they said 20 more minutes. After another hour (2.5 hours total), I called Eat24 again, who called them again, and they said it was on the way. After another half hour (3 hours total) I contacted Eat24 again, who contacted them again, and they said they had been at my house and knocked 5 times but I didn't answer. TOTAL LIE - I was here the whole time and I have a motion activated sensor at my front door that activates a video and pings my iPhone whenever someone is within five feet of my front door (Ring Doorbell is the name of the productl) and they were never hear. Plus my dogs go nuts when someone is at the door.  And they claimed to Eat24 that my food had \"gone bad\" in the ten minutes since they had supposedly been at my house so they weren't going to \"come back\" - and anyway they were closed now they claimed (I ordered at 7 and it was now 10:15p). NEVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE, and if Eat24 doesn't drop them from their list, avoid Eat24 as well since they will keep on clients that treat their customers this way. I still cannot believe I spent an entire Saturday night dealing with this awful place, and still ended up with an empty stomach when it was all over."}
{"text":"I saw the ad on a Chinese news paper and decided to give it a try. I am glad I did. My husband and I are both very happy with our food. It is clean and food tasted fresh. I love the noodle soup I ordered. It is rice noodle with wine cooked chicken, bone in. I love the taste of the chicken and the soup. The price is very reasonable, too. We are going back soon to try different dishes, but I know I will for sure order the noodle soup again. It is worth the drive even though we are kind of far from the restaurant."}
{"text":"I arrived in this place with restaurant.com certificate and they refused to accept them telling me that they didn't understand the contract that they had to offer $5 with a purchase of $10 so they give me a 10% discount instead.  Feeling bait and switched, I saw a dish in Chinese that I liked so I said no problem so give me the Sour Vegetable with Chitlings as well as homemade yogurt.  The lady took my $15 dollar and asked me want any change back?  First of all, change are automatically given and it is extremely tacky to demand a tip from me.  The meal is $12.45 and want a 20% tip even before the service is rendered?  I told her to give me $1 back. She told me this is her first day on the job..Forced and demand a tip?  ..May be the fact that I also Chinese but this type of behavior is totally unacceptable where I came from and even it is unheard of in USA.  The meal is decent with excellent knife skills and taste great (****) but being bait and switched, forced on paying a tip, and not even a thank you at the end of the meal earned yourself a two star rating from me."}
{"text":"Food arrived late by almost 30 min, taste was mediocre at best, and 4 hours after eating only half of his orange chicken(that was mostly bread without meat) my husband was having explosive vomiting. I had the sizzling beef that was mostly grissle and bland. The one thing they did well was steamed rice but fire 35.00 I could have done that myself."}
{"text":"I told myself that I won't let myself write this review angry but seven hours later, I'm still fuming.  I don't think I can think back to this place feeling any better so let's get this over with.  This is going to be wordy because there will be hella details.  I've been wanting to try this place for over half a year now after getting some xiaolongbao [ ???, XLB ] at this other place.  So as soon as the waitress sat us down, that's what I order.  I asked her for one order of XLB.  Granted, I speak Cantonese and not Mandarin so there might be a *slight* accent but it's really not that hard to understand but the girl just looked at me blankly and let out a, \"Huh? What?\"  So I spoke up a little clearer and a little slower that, \"I would like one order of xiaolongbao... you know, the soup dumplings?\"  I could tell she was still confused but before I could reiterate, she turns around and bellows loudly to this elderly man that just got done taking down a phone-in order:  \"[surname of the elder gentleman]-??!  ???!  ???!\"  Yes, we got it.  You don't understand.  I bet you didn't anticipate that I can understand EVERYTHING you're saying.  So the elderly guy comes by with the patience of a saint.  Wow, lady-waitress...  an older person than you can understand me yet you can't?  Your English was better than his' as well.  What are they paying you for?  Whatever.  So we order, he understands perfectly fine, and places that in for us while we browsed the Chinese menu [which we grabbed by ourselves because the waitress thought we were some dumb Americanized-Asians and gave us the crappy paper menu with junk like General Tszu's Chicken] and decided on our orders.  We ended up originally choosing the Grandmother's Braised Pork, which we were informed that they ran out so we changed it to the Braised Pork with Preserved Vegetables, and the Fish Filet with Black Beans.  The XLBs come out with the vinegar sauce sans ginger.  I can overlook this but they forgot our spoons.  So we wait and wait and wait for no joke, ten minutes, to get the waitress' attention so we don't waste soup from the dumplings because she couldn't give us a spoon.  After our XLBs were pretty cold by that point, I turned around, locked eyes with her, and asked her for spoons.  She looks at me like I'm stupid or something for needing a spoon for soup dumplings.  You try eating soup with your chopsticks, lady.  Step off.  I ate those dumplings in a pretty salty mood by that point --- XLBs which were okay in flavor, lacking in soup, and weren't really noteworthy.  The other place makes better XLBs.  And then came a beautiful dish of Braised Pork with Preserved Vegetables and a fish dish.  The fatty braised pork was rendered to melt-in-your-mouth perfection and that preserved vegetable gave it a nice sour bite.  Delicious.  Almost as good as how Mama W. makes it.  But the fish dish... it had tofu and came in a sweet & sour and spicy sauce.  This is definitely not what we ordered.  Where's the black bean sauce?  It was another ordeal trying to get the waitress and/or elderly gentleman's attention.  We got the waitresses who gave the fish dish a dirty look and got the elderly guy... *again.*  Ask Tom D., they know how timid I am when it comes to complaining about something.  I would rather suck it up and drink a flat alcoholic beverage for $11 than complain but this isn't what we ordered.  So I asked the guy if this was the Fish Fillet with Black Bean which he excitedly repeats back.  \"Yes... but there aren't any black beans.\"  \"Yes yes, you order black bean!\" he replies enthusiastically.  \"I know... this isn't black bean.  There's no beans.  We didn't order this.\"  So he stares at it, grabs the plate, and whisks it to the kitchen.  I was too busy fuming at this point to eavesdrops but I did hear the kind elderly guy telling the chefs, \"?? black bean\"  No black bean.  Does not have black bean.  I hear more chatter and he brings it back and puts it on the table.    \"Yes... Yes, there's black bean.\"  No there's not.  Where's the black bean?   \"It's in the sauce...\"  I encourage you all to look at the picture I've attached and tell me where the hell the black beans are.  Google Image it if you will.  But a chicken can't talk to a duck --- as is this language barrier between us.  So I glare at him, he stares at the wall, walks away, and no one comes by to check on us again.  I only saw the rude female one more time to drop off the bill.  So I take a tentative bite of the fish dish.  Sweet, sour, and spicy with no black bean taste at all.  There was also waaay too much vinegar, the fish looked disgusting and was soggy, and most importantly:  NOT WHAT I ORDERED DESPITE YOUR CLAIMS OF IT BEING WITH BLACK BEAN.  $29.01 on a meal where service was null.  I even grabbed my own damn box to package the food to go which sits untouched in the fridge.  I'm so mad.  Come here with a Mandarin speaker so they don't push you around or don't come here at all."}
