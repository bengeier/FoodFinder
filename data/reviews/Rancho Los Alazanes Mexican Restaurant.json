{"text":"I rarely use the word \"awesome\". However, Rancho Los Alazanes Mexican Restaurant is by far one of the finest, authentic place to see the decorations  and enjoy REAL Mexican food !!  The EXTRA HOT SALSA is sensational !! Nothing is more satisfying than a \"belch\" later on to remind of how good the celantro  in the hot picante sauce really was !!  We will be back !!  These last 2 times got me hooked !!  Thanks Rancho Los Alazanes !!"}
{"text":"Their food is great.  All served piping hot, and presented beautifully. I was pleased that the quesadilla was perfectly toasty, the rice was moist- not dried or clumpy.   Their complimentary salsa is super.  Fast service- and they answer their phone unlike El a Patron in Chardon!  This is my \"go to restaurant\" for Mexican dinners."}
{"text":"Price, quality, atmosphere, service, bar, everything was on point. The staff worked hard, food came out fast, restaurant was clean.. Great specials too. The bucket of 5 beers for $10 is a steal! We recommend and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not good! Poor service, they don't come around to check on you. They'd rather play with their toddlers that hang out there.  A bit rude when they do come around, but might be because of language barrier...not much English experience.  Food nothing special,  but not bad. Better than Taco Bell, but not as good as other Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Sunday night after the apple farm and it was time for Mexican food!  I had been wanting to try this place after reading the rave reviews, and the result is one thumb up.    Pros: The service was great; everything was clean, unlike a lot of Mexican places; and the Pollo Jose was fabulous.    Cons: Incredibly weak and limeade-tasting margarita (how can you screw that up?), and definitely canned chicken in the Chicken Burrito.  Yucko.    With all the competition out there, we won't be rushing back to Rancho Los Alazanes."}
{"text":"This was the worst Mexican restaurant I've been to in over 10 years. The only thing that was not watered down were the chips. Drive past this restaurant and go to the McDonald's..."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, local, colorful Mexican restaurant with friendly staff who made the lunch fun for our adolescent grandchildren.  Food delivered in timely fashion, everyone liked what they ordered.  Have returned and will go again"}
{"text":"AMAZING!  We came here for my birthday lunch and this place has delicious food, great colorful atmosphere and very friendly staff.  We all had a great time.  Being from San Diego, we have a lot of great Mexican food places but this one was better than most I have ever had.  I ate the steak fajitas, also ordered at our table was the Acapulco plate, veggie and chicken fajitas and chicken enchiladas.  All wonderful.  Our picky 18 month old had his very own chicken soft taco and ate the whole thing!  Thank you guys and we will definitely be back when we visit our family again...I know the local family will be back soon as well!"}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant with a nice colorful ambience and tasty food. It seems everyone here speaks Spanish as their first language which is a good sign of great Mexican food, the staff was very nice.  My wife and I each had different combination plates which made for a nice variety of things to sample. The kids meals were good sized and delicious however they put a red sauce and cheese on the outside of a burrito so if your kids are expecting to eat it with their hands (like at chipotle or Taco Bell) you have to tell them no sauce and no cheese on the outside of a kids burrito.  If you have a choice between chicken or beef I highly recommend the chicken as it was delicious roasted and shredded chicken and the beef was a bit on the tasteless size with very little spice.  The margarita was average at best, a little too sweet not really very much alcohol for a five dollar drink. Not quite sure if I'll go back as I don't live close to here, but I probably would if I was in town."}
{"text":"Okay Mex for an independently-owned place on the East Side but nowhere near the caliber of El Jalapeno in Lakewood. That place is awesome.  Three of us went for lunch.  The tables and booths are actually cool...authentic styling.  I thought some of the food was bland.  Salsa was good.  Tortilla chips were underwhelming which was a bummer.  Fajitas were good but they did not arrive sizzling..meaning, we didn't get the show."}
{"text":"had a great time here.  the food was delicious.  great deal too.  our waitress was Michelle and she was super friendly and nice.  i'm a vegetarian and i got the chilli rellanos.   it was excellent.  we have been twice and definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I think its been awhile since we ate there.. I can't even begin to say how bad it was. I would have given no stars but it wouldn't let me..  We ordered a Margarita unblended on the rocks with lots of salt.  frozen was delivered and he disappeared before we could even say a word.so my husband drank it  ... we ordered different dishes but it was all the same. enchilada or burrito. and awful  .. we took off the shells and ate some of it .. got a check and swore not to tell anyone we even went there.. and many many antacids later.. not a good night.. what happened it used to be good.  just terrible"}
{"text":"This was my first time dining at Rancho Los Alazanes.  My friend and I arrived during Happy Hour and were offered Happy Hour priced Margaritas, on the rocks or frozen for $4.99.  Crunchy warm chips and and homemade salsa were placed on the table.  I proceeded to order the chicken taco salad, which was prepared a little bit different than I expected (in a good way).   The salad was served in a warm tortilla shell bowl, and there was at least 2 inches of shredded, seasoned chicken in the bottom of the bowl, topped with lettuce, tomatoes, black beans and sour cream, I added a little bit the of homemade salsa served with our complimentary tortilla chips.   The meal, along with the Margarita, was pretty tasty.   I would definitely go back, if in the area."}
{"text":"our first time in the place. Lively atmosphere with a party room in the back. A bucket of premium beers is only $10. the waitress was pleasant and patient while we asked about the extended menu. this place has just about every mexican dish you can imagine. Portion Size, Cheap Beer, Good Service = I will be back"}
{"text":"Yummy, huge menu great service. This is worth the drive as the food is so good.  The chic fajita is fabulous, none better in Cleveland eastern burbs. Guac is fresh, margaritas have seen the tequila bottle and beer in a frosty mug.  Week night specials are amazing. What are you waiting for? Go there now!"}
{"text":"This place is quirky and good and so was the service. The owner of the restaurant was very kind and friendly. I ordered the steak fajitas and it came out sizzling on a hot plate with some tortillas. The beef was a little overcooked but was still very flavorful. I will definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Wonderful time with friends tonight! Warm atmosphere with tasty food. I think the Rita could of used a little more tequila , but just look at the size of the pineapple chicken we ordered !!!"}
{"text":"Great food, and very inexpensive- the whole family was happy!"}
{"text":"Typical mexican restaurant. It was very good. Service was OK. I would be back, but it's nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but if I am making food from my culture I would want to put the best foot forward.  I'm pretty sure one of their feet would have been better eating than their food.  The chips were from a bag and the salsa was \"old\" tasting.  This acted as a harbinger of things to come.  I had a combo of beef enchilada, beef burrito, a cheese relleno.  There was no differentiating the burrito from the enchilada other than the fact one was a corn tortilla and the other a flour tortilla.  The relleno was battered and deep fried (not what was described on the menu nor which i have had from better Mexican restaurants.) which leads me to believe it was a preprepared frozen thing.  The beans were from a can and weak at best.  I will not ever go back to have their garbage Mexican food on a budget.  Now I am dealing with digestive issues not like I would have if we had chosen to eat at a respectable restaurant.    I don't know what these other reviewers are used to when it comes to Mexican food but I would gladly drive way more to eat at Compadre's on the Mentor Painesville border.  Their much higher quality of ingredients and cooking ability are worth the extra drive.  This place is not worth going to I would rather eat taco bell than this joint. Do not eat here it will only encourage them."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very good especially for Chesterland.  I give it 4 stars only because the Frozen Margarita could have been better.  The food is very traditional and good, and the ambiance is welcoming."}
{"text":"Went to Ranchos Los Alazanes for the first time two years ago and have been back countless times since. Friendly service, a huge menu and some of the best local mexican food around have made this one of my favorites as of late.  Highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Love that this place is not a chain. Great atmosphere and the staff is very friendly. The food is really fresh and has great flavor. I like that my entree was not smothered in sauce but had just the right amount to make it tasty. Love the salsa and the guacamole was wonderful and i'm not a huge fan of guacamole."}
{"text":"Great local mexican food that comes out hot and fast. Service was good, food was what I expected, and margaritas tasted great. This was my first time here and i will be back."}
{"text":"Still has great mexican and the salsa is great, but they have lost a star because they got rid of their \"lunch punch\" program.    Myself along with usually 6-10 co-workers went weekly on Tuesday and it looks like this will now be on the \"general lunch rotation\" list rather than a weekly place.    If you are in the area and looking for a good deal for lunch of dinner definitely stop in, you won't be disappointed, but it looks like new management has alienated some of their most loyal customers."}
{"text":"Bad food on Cinco de Mayo.  Chips were stale and cold. But mostly stale. I ordered a combo of a cheese enchilada and a chile relleno and added a hard taco with a side of mole. When the food came without the taco and mole, a different server explained to me that I ordered incorrectly.   The food came quickly but had cold spots. Weird. I think it was previously made, frozen or refrigerated and then heated (or not) and served.   So for two sub-standard items, stale chips and a Coke - it cost $10.63.   I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"I think that this is an underrated and overlooked mexican joint. The food is great and the price is cheap. We have always had great service and happy bellies there. The drinks are great too! Definitely a place you can bring a large family with kids and be loud if you want to! Plenty of parking and great location. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The service is wonderful and the food is awesome! One of the best things on their menu is Coctel de Cameron. It's shrimp cocktail but Mexican style. It's definitely enough for two to share for an appetizer. It's cold, in a tomato type broth cilantro, avocado. shrimp, tomatoes and red onion. You will love it!! Just make sure you point in out on the menu as another dish on the menu sounds just like it and has confused the servers before. Or maybe my Spanish was a little off :) The fajitas are delicious and so it everything else on the menu. You will not be disapointed."}
{"text":"When I grew up in Novelty, we didn't even have a McDonald's, so it was nice to hear that a traditional Mexican restaurant opened in the area. My parents took me on a recent visit home. My first impression was the friendly service and bright clean room.  My mother struggles with Alzheimers, so I appreciated the hostless kindly seating us in the nearest booth. I ordered a margarita on the rocks.  It was a little bit watery for my taste.  However, the food made up for it.  It is 'traditional' (what we mid-westerners expect-think Chimichangas) Mexican, with some traditional Mexican thrown in.   I ordered the shredded chicken with mole.  It was fresh and had a nice spice to it.  My dad ordered shrimp with garlic and judging by his plate, he was a fan.  It's nice to see a non-chain open up in our small town.  I will certainly visit on my next trip home."}
{"text":"I've been here 2 or 3 times and liked the food OK. But I'm reviewing as a vegetarian, and despite the menu having vegetarian options, this was a bad option that I can't risk again. Specifically: the last time I want, there were multiple pieces of random meats in the vegetarian dish. I don't believe this was out of spite, just a sign of a chaotic kitchen maybe--ingredients getting mixed around from bin to bin? I find that's almost always true for omelets ordered out, and I'm guessing this is the same thing. But that's bad for sanitary and allergy reasons too, not just for vegetarians/vegans who are disgusted to find a piece of some animals knee-gristle in their mouth.  The waitress was very nice, and agreed completely that meat in the vegetarian dishes was a big problem. I don't know what the cooks thought, of course, but she said she'd tell them. And she offered my meal free, but I'd already eaten a lot and insisted on paying.  I might try the place again, hoping to not get Two of Every Animal in my vegetarian food. But only after much time passes.  So this would probably get more stars for meat-eaters, but 1 star for vegetarians. I'm splitting the difference with 2 stars."}
{"text":"I live in this community and have visited this mexican restaurant many times. Drink specials are good. Food is very good. Complimentary chips & salsa are great. The staff,....well they do get the job done,....most of the time. While the entire waite staff is bilingual, sometimes orders do get placed wrong. If an order is place incorrectly and you get a slightly different meal than you asked for,...you can try to have them correct it, but I find it easier to just eat what they bring. Occasionally you will have to ask for a water refill but If you're drinking alcohol, they are Johnny on the spot!. I don't want to discourage anyone because the food is really good and reasonably priced. Just sayin to be patient. Some menu items I am quite fond of is the Playa Burritos and all the Fajita dishes are sizzlin great!. Just don't be afraid to flag down your wait staff if you need something. Otherwise you may be overlooked."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. The place got a great decor. So you get a great first impression. We went during a weekday lunchtime and there was barely anyone there, so we got a great service too. In food terms, I've had better Mexican food before. The chicken tortilla soup though is good but is lacking the real authentic tortilla soup flavor. The chicken in the enchilada was completely dry and I didn't enjoy the enchilada at all. We also ordered the carnitas la Mexicana, which was very good. Except it came with grilled jalapenos which weren't spicy at all (I mean they tasted like bell peppers). But those are hit and miss, so it's probably not the cook's fault. All and all, nice place and I would go back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Love this place... Most of these Mexican restaurants have the same menu , but this one is the best around.  Great tasty food, great service and friendly management.  Cheap happy hour drinks as well.  I have been here many times and I have never been disappointed."}
