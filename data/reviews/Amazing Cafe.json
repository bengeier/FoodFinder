{"text":"This is hands down my new favorite spot in the South Side! Great service, great food and a stellar Mocha!"}
{"text":"One of the best smoothies I ever had (got a second before leaving) and, when I reported that I had dropped a ring somewhere in the restaurant, they searched for my ring after hours and shipped it to me free of charge!"}
{"text":"this place is the best ever. the service is amazing, the food is amazing it is healthy. thank you thank you thank youuuuu!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Although I'm not a vegan, or even vegetarian, Amazing Cafe provides all types of substitute options for people who enjoy foods with meat without leaving you wanting more. The smoothies are to die for!"}
{"text":"Two visits in and I will definitely be back for the terrific vegan food. So delicious. The veggie burger was awesome, and served with baked fries (only good) and slaw (terrific.)   My second visit I ordered a smoothie. I was on my bike and ordered a smoothie for take out. I was asked \"do you know about our Mason jar deposit?\" I did not. Well apparently you spend an extra three bucks to carry a glass jar out to the street. If you bring it back, you get your three dollars back. So many things wrong with this idea for people walking or biking around on Carson Street. Or driving. I'd love to see a car with a cup holder that fits a Mason jar. After being told that they'll serve the smoothie in a plastic cup but \"it's bad for the environment\" (no kidding) I was on my way with what was a delicious blueberry and almond butter smoothie.  I recycled the plastic cup.   Good smoothie.  Major hipster hassle."}
{"text":"This cafe is dedicated to providing delicious smoothies, juices, and food with the highest quality possible ingredients.  I love that they use local produce when they can and (i think) are plastic-free.  I just had a delicious banana/cacao/almond smoothie that was huge and filling for just under $8.  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Try the mocha - it's delicious! There are really unique dishes here that you won't find elsewhere in the city. And it's (almost) all good for you!"}
{"text":"Good quality, great taste, friendly people. In town for a trade show. I'm loving this place every day! 4 stars because of wait time on food. I think they need help, someone go rock their kitchen!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh! My boyfriend loves it too and he eats lots of meat. I have gotten everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. However if you ever are disappointed for some reason, the people at this cafe will find a way to make you happy. They just care about the quality and consistency of the food. What more can I say. It's AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed, I went here with big expectations. In my opinion it wasn't clean inside. The staff wasn't polite at all. I ordered a fruit bowl which wasn't at all what I expected it to be, plus I ordered the falafel salad on the go. Few hours later when I wanted to eat it, I found out that it was given to me WITHOUT the falafel!!!!! A falafel salad without falafel. That's new.. And that's not what I paid for. Over all, a bad experience unfortunately."}
{"text":"The food is incredible.  I am not a vegetarian - but I cannot get enough of this place.  The food is unique and so flavorful.  I make it a point to go regularly and cannot say enough good things about this place.  Try it and you will see!"}
{"text":"Still fantastic and fresh! The peace pizza is delicious! I always want to try something new but just love it! The latte is creamy and smooth! I believe that it's coconut and almond milk blend! The team that works there is just so kind and well-versed in healthy eating!  PS... Kid/baby friendly too :)"}
{"text":"Cute place with unique decorations & a convenient location.  I ordered the acai bowl. While good, it is rather small. There is a place in NYC called juice generation. I have been on the hunt for a place that is as good/better/close to what that acai bowl tastes like. Unfortunately, it looks like my mission is not complete yet.  The tacos held lots of flavor. The coffee looked delicious from what i could see from the patrons around me."}
{"text":"As the name states, this place is amazing!Amazing Cafe has a chill, casual atmosphere and the food is fantastic! It's not what I would expect in Pittsburg but they really have a gem here. And the prices are totally reasonable for the level of quality and size of the portions. I got the coconut curry with seasonal veggies and brown rice which was awesome, my buddy raved about his soup and alive salad. The juice and smoothie selection looks great as well.  They really have healthy vegan food right, very little emphasis on tofu/tempeh soy products, almost entirely gluten free, and tons of local ingredients. It's my guess that you can't go wrong at this spot"}
{"text":"Just wow!  The food was beautiful and delicious.  My husband, who is a carnivore, initially looked at the menu with trepidation.  He ordered the veggie burger, which came with three different salads, and he devoured every bite.  My dish, called Kindness, was a wonderful variety of savory, perfectly seasoned vegetables.  We are both looking forward to returning to this delightful cafe."}
{"text":"Came in today for some tea and snacks. Everything was delicious, the staff was really nice and it had a great atmosphere. My boyfriend who isn't vegan loved the cookies and brownies. They were certainly better than most vegan snacks I've had before. I'll be back for sure. When I asked the boyfriend if he wanted to come back, he excitedly said yes, that everything smells good and he wants come back to try the meals."}
{"text":"Never tried an acai bowl before but I ordered one here and it was quite filling. I'm not sure about the smoothie here though. The interior is nice and relaxing. Definitely a friendly place."}
{"text":"Everything here is AMAZING! No joke. The best vegan restaurant that doesn't feel vegan or stuffy or anything but freakin' AMAZING. They are also very consistent and nice. They use a lot of local ingredients and all organic. They are completely transparent about their ingredients. It's special to have such a good restaurant like this in Pgh. Thank you Amazing Cafe!"}
{"text":"The name says it all!  This place is great.  Solid vegetarian food made with fresh ingredients and a friendly smile.  I only tried the veggie burger and at $13 I thought this better be  amazing.  Well worth it and would love to go back if ever in Pittsburgh again.  I'm not sure what all the burger was made of, but it was great.  I thought my order came with slaw and pickles, but I got a salad, slaw, and home fries with it.  No complaints there.  I should have gotten a juice, my only regret.  They are only open 8am-3pm, so get it while you can."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a late breakfast on Saturday and had a delightful bowl of \"kindness\" A little gem on Carson street! I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Great vegan joint in the heart of the Southside.  No shortage of hipsters and yoga pants. The fare is fresh and tasty. Fresh juices and smoothies made to order. Give the Peace Pizza or the Tulum Tacos a try. The breakfast specialties are good as well. Grape tasted. Grape approved."}
{"text":"I stopped here after yoga today (convenient since it was just upstairs) and had one of the best pieces of chocolate cake that I have ever had - Bliss is appropriately named  and even after a generous sized piece, I wish I had ordered more to tide me over until I can stop there again.   In addition to phenomenal desserts, there are smoothies, juices, salads, soups and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Amazing doesn't do it justice. But words just cannot describe some moments in life. The eating experience I just had is one of those. I want to rate 100 stars, but 5 is good enough.  I searched \"vegan\" on Yelp, last night and saw a few close to my downtown Pittsburgh location. But Amazing with five stars stood out. So, I have a love/hate relationship with the Southside. Parking is tough, partying drunk college kids. It's fun though! I love dancing! Today, I decided at noon to stop by and get something for dinner. I currently work 3-11 at a job where food is bleh. Chipotle is the only other option downtown (since they're NON-GMO!!!!!).  I walked into Amazing after reading reviews. Beautiful, open space, well lit, bright, fun colors and decor. Delicious! House made veggie burger, aka Buddha Burger to-go.  It came with roasted seasoned potatoes, sauce on burger, idk what. The best salad ever! Free water with a  hint of lime, dash of Himalayan pink salt whilst I waited. Free wifi. Lovely employees and patrons. I will go back for fresh juices, and smoothies! Thanks  to all the beautiful, perfect souls whom made my day, and meal possible! Heaven is a place on Earth with You Mother Gaia! Fabulous food! Go baby, go, go, go! This is real food. Fresh, local, healthy, truly SOUL FOOD. AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE!"}
{"text":"Love this little gem here in Southside. The staff is very kind and their food is too. very clean & earthly indoors. Small portions for the price you pay but that's probably ideal in the health world :o)"}
{"text":"Words can't describe how incredible the brunch is. I ordered the smile and it was perfection, not to mention filling. It looks like they ran out of the maple cashew cream and replaced it with a berry drizzle which made it a little heavy on the fruit, but still equally delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing Cafe never disappoints. This past time, I got the pura vida smoothie and jackfruit \"crab cakes\". The smoothie, which consisted of cacao, banana, sunflower seed butter, and maca, was so yummy! If you love chocolate/chocolate almond milk I would definitely recommend. If you are adventurous and want to try something new, get the crab cakes. The vegan crab cakes were served on a bed of salad, were crispy on the outside, and actually reminded me of crab cakes! Thank you Amazing Cafe for truly being an amazing destination for vegan food!"}
{"text":"The amazing cafe was truly a cute little place in the south side. I don't honestly know if I'd call it amazing, but it was A-OK!   My friend and I went on a Saturday morning for the first time and realized that (1) you order at the counter (2) the menu is confusing and only some items are available at certain times or certain days (3) if you order coffee, you have to ask for almond or coconut milk, as they do not have creamer out on the tables or anything (4) when you swipe your card, there are tip options for 15, 20, and 25% although the staff doesn't really wait on you.   With all that in mind, I paid $40 for a smoothie bowl, a plate of toast and two coffees. Pricey but vegan so hell- why not?!   The smoothie bowl was good. My friend got the French toast and didn't like it, as it was really heavy (I liked it though). The coffee wasnt very good at all.   Overall, cute concept but I felt like it was lacking something. Would probably go back just for the smoothie bowl."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places in Pittsburgh. The food is always amazing, fresh and healthy."}
{"text":"Light vegetarian meals. Great variety to choose from. Excellent fresh juice selection. Can't wait to go back again soon!"}
{"text":"love everything about this place! I got the after party juice and the hope salad and both were perfect. fresh ingredients, good combinations of flavored and textures, not to mention healthy! and the cafe itself is adorable. the blue walls have a calming effect upon entering and the decor is charming. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Delicious, local, fresh food with flavor. No meat substitutes- all real, good food that makes you feel good. The Peace Pizza had delicious tomato sauce, crispy crust and fresh beets and root vegetables with greens and hemp seeds lightly dressed to top it off.  The Abundance had good flavor, spice, and heat that made my belly and mouth happy. Can't wait to come back and try everything else! Thank you, Amazing Cafe!"}
{"text":"My vegan best friend was visiting from out of town, and as someone who's trying to transition to a fully vegan diet myself, we knew we had to try this place! The food was incredible. She had the tulum tacos, I had the Buddha burger. To die for.   My only problem was the staff. There were three people working, and only one of them seemed interested in being there. She went out of her way to fix a juice that I ordered that had too much ginger (just my own personal taste), and to make sure I liked it better after she adjusted it. The other two barely made an effort to look me in the eye.   It could have just been an off day, and no one was downright rude, so I will definitely be back. The food was delicious - I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Stopped here for lunch with my family of 4 a few months ago, and everything we ordered was delicious: acai bowl, loco moco, Buddha burger, chili, and peace pizza. I've been back several times for the curry vegetables and smoothies. Not just tasty for vegan food. Delicious by any standard. One of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Acai bowl = love. I (and our planet) really appreciate that they've gone nut free because of the California drought. The granola in the acai bowl might be my favorite granola ever. I've had the jackfruit sandwich before and it was also 5 stars. The juice prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"The food here is great and the people are nice. The atmosphere is chill and a cool place to grab a bite. I will say that it is a little pricey as most vegan restaurants are but I know this will change as more and more places come along.  I ordered the Peace Pizza which sounded promising (love the name) and it was delicious! Even better that they have a Gluten-Free crust! I'm don't eat exclusively gluten free but I do prefer it when available and I'm sure most know how difficult it can be to find both vegan and GF as an option. The pesto sauce and veggies make this a dish you can't go wrong with.  For dessert, I had the chocolate chip cookie and the almond butter brownie (yup, you read that right, almond butter brownie), both of which are GF as well! My favorite was the brownie - a bit crunchy on the outside and gooey on the inside! The cookie was a great choice, too, but I certainly recommend the brownie. They had doughnuts that looked intriguing, but I didn't take the chance.   Overall, a typical all-vegan restaurant with cool quotes on the walls and tasty dishes along with friendly service. Also, I think it's neat that they offer the free lime water. Can't complain! 5/5"}
{"text":"A pretty bowl of food in a pretty setting can go a long way. Such was the case at Amazing Café on Sunday for brunch. I ordered the \"Kindness\" (and didn't even snicker as I did it) and my buddy ordered the Acai Bowl. While the Kindness was solid, I must admit that my food envy over that \"amazing\" Acai Bowl was palpable.  It was SO good. I'll probably never get anything else. Like I mentioned, the Kindness was pretty good, just no comparison to the Acai Bowl. Aside from that, there isn't a ton of variety so if you find something you love, stick with it. I can't wait to try Amazing for an evening meal!"}
{"text":"Still thinking about the waffle I had almost 2 days later. I might return for another while I'm in town. Anyways, isn't this what dining is about? You try something you can't forget and it inspires you to try something new at home.   Anyways so I obviously had the waffle, and it was great. Served with syrup, but I didn't even have it since the fruit compote and coconut chia added so much.   Nice healthy addition to the city!"}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to try Amazing Cafe's brunch over the weekend with a friend, and it didn't disappoint! Everything was as delicious and beautiful as I'd hoped. I was been torn between here and Zenith for a truly vegan brunch experience, but the photos of Zenith's food just looked a little spottier to me and the reviews were more mixed.   My friend and I were able to sit down at a table as soon as we arrived. It was 12:30 on a Saturday. She'd arrived earlier and reported that it was packed, but by the time I got there things had cleared out substantially. There was a menu board full of enticing hot and cold dishes, brunch plates, juices, smoothies, coffee drinks, and tea. They also carry Gluten Free Goat donuts. You order at the counter, and your food is brought to your table as soon as it's ready. We both got the Smile, which is French toast with a fruit topping and a cashew cream drizzle. Our food arrived within fifteen minutes, and we started eating. I honestly can't ever remember having such a delicious serving of French toast before in my life...maybe the cinnamon apple and whipped cream topped monstrosity I had at Cracker Barrel as a child came close, but this version was fresher, lighter, and ten times more flavorful. There were blueberries, raspberries, and a crumble topping with toasted pumpkin seeds on two warm, tender pieces of bread. The generous drizzle of cashew cream lent the whole thing a richer taste than normal. I polished off the entire serving despite my original intent, which was to save half for a late breakfast the following morning. I already can't wait to come back for more French toast as well as their delicious-looking juices and raw Pad Thai. I have a feeling Amazing Café is going to claim a regular spot in my weekend restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"Never thought I'd come to like vegan food so much, but this joint completely changed my mind. Originally had my eye on this place when it first opened, but it really got my attention once I saw it shooting up the rankings for top-rated restaurants so I figured it was worth a try. First time I came here, I tried the Divine Acai Bowl, which is a rather busy combination of acai puree, vanilla, banana, raspberry, topped with buckwheat granola, dried fruit, coconut, chia seed, bananas. The taste and verdict? Exceeded my expectations. Probably the happiest my mouth has felt eating something like this. It also helped knowing that most of the ingredients found in this are healthy = light on the conscience. I've also tried the Loco Moco Bowl, which was equally as delicious, the Tulum Tacos (best vegan tacos ever), and the crab cakes. In terms of pricing, it's definitely on the more expensive side, but the place definitely makes up for that in the quality of the food that's prepared for you. Definitely worth a try, even for non-vegans (I'm not one, but man is this place good)."}
{"text":"I adore Amazing Cafe and am devastated they are closed. PLEASE OPEN AGAIN SOON. :(  I love their green smoothies, their smoothie bowls and their entrees. Their veggie pad thai is so good, and their juice always gives me a boost of energy. I love that this spot is one of the only spots to get quality vegan options in south side. I am really hoping they open again soon!"}
{"text":"First time visiting the city and this place did not disappoint! Ordered two juices and the pizza, abundance and veggie sandwich. All were so tasty. Even dad who is a meat lover loved his veggie sandwich, didn't even want to share any of it! :D"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times, and we keep going back. Eating in, the smoothies are so good. We've had a few hits here and there, the \"french toast\" during brunch on the weekends being one: once we were given a large portion, the other visit a super small portion. Also the same experience with the \"veggie burger\". A little inconsistent.   Same goes with service or attitude, inconsistent: sometimes nice, other times the person at the register can be a bit, snooty.   Lastly, when they're busy - the dishes overflow, and it can be a long wait.   But overall, the wait is worth it. We'll keep going, just wish the cafe workers would be more friendly."}
{"text":"Unleash your inner hippie- no dread locks or patchouli required! Tasty gluten free, vegan & local treats galore can be found here. The juices & smoothies are fresh and virtuous, the gluten free pastries are decadent and luscious. The French press coffee was smooth and simply divine. Come here right away for some delicious clean-eating and stay for the fantastically friendly service. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I can't stop thinking about my brunch! I had the acai bowl and it was so good! I really wanted to lick the bowl! I had a bite if my friend's food as well, the Kindness and the French Toast.  Everything was so good. I wish I lived closer because I would eat there every morning.    The restaurant is decorated so cute too.  Drinking from mason jars, it just felt like home. The walls were decorated with raw wood and simple fabrics. They staff were all so friendly!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place!  Delicious, local, well crafted food!  Beautiful decor!  The highlight of the Southside for me."}
{"text":"What is there not to love about this place? I have been a wanting to come here for quite sometime and today was the perfect morning to stop in. I arrived as soon as they opened and was pretty shocked at the number of people that flowed in after me. The menu was pretty impressive for a gluten free joint; the more options the better! Since I am a huge fan of acai bowls, I had to give theirs a try. They had 3 different kinds and I decided to try the loco moco. The chocolate craving was real this morning and the loco moco satisfied my sweet tooth! Let me just say that I've tried a lot of acai bowls and this one at amazing cafe is in my top 5 for sure! The price is $10 but you really do get a lot in the bowl unlike other acai bowls I have had downtown that are priced the same. It comes filled with banana, strawberry, sunflower seed butter, cacao, acai puree, topped with buckwheat granola, dried fruit, coconut, and chia seeds. Some acai bowls can be too soupy, but I assure you this one is not! I left feeling full and refreshed. I also was really enjoying the 80s music they had playing and the overall interior just brought me happy vibes! Also, they offer food from the gluten free goat bakery which is an incredible bake shop. I have had their donuts before at a yelp event and cannot wait for them to open their shop in Garfield! But for now you can find some of their goodies here. I ended up taking an apple cider donut with me for the road. Such a delightful treat. I cannot wait to try more things here and will be coming back very soon:)"}
{"text":"Simply amazing. We ventured here in negative degree weather, but were immediately welcomed with warm, flavorful aromas.  There are two high top bench tables and several smaller tables, but despite the limited seating we had no problems finding a spot.  I decided to go for the Tulum tacos, which were FILLED with crisp roasted vegetables, a veggie slaw, and tofu. At $10, the portion was large, and I was definitely full! I was also very excited to try their fresh juice- I had the clean green machine- super yummy and not too sweet! I'll definitely be back for more:)"}
{"text":"Everything I order here is always fresh and delicious. The only problem I have is with the staff, which keeps me from going as often as I'd like to.   Not very friendly, just going through the motions.   The food is the only thing that keeps me going back."}
{"text":"Good location. Not good parking. Food was tasty, obviously healthy, but quite expensive. Very cute interior, would try again."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh could use more places like this. The Southside is a particularly interesting choice of location for it given that every third place is bar food or hangover grub (not that there's anything wrong with that!). The menu here is small, but the options are pretty interesting. Given the limiting nature of the vegan options available, they do a very good job of making food that both tastes good and is filling. Both the sandwich items I tried had many pieces of vegetables or mushrooms in them. The peace pizza was also quite leafy and felt pretty comfortable to eat.  With both the taco and the grace sandwich, I would have to note that the flavors are pretty strong, boosted mainly by ingredients like slaw and pickles. While many people might enjoy those things, I found it to be a tad much, and I wonder if it's just an over-reliance on sauce and sour notes to boost the otherwise vegan creations. Both items were not particularly easy to eat by hand.  The acai bowl was pretty good and had a lot of the traditional ingredients. For some reason our banana and raspberry were blended into the smoothie rather than remaining intact on top. Things overall were a tad pricey (I'd probably prefer knocking everything down by a couple dollars) but it's not a huge concern."}
{"text":"Best vegan food in south side!!! I love eating here: the food is delicious.. And you don't feel like crap when you Finnish your food! Make sure you check out brunch on Saturdays and Sunday's... Highly recommended the fruit parfait with gluten free granola and the French toast!!!"}
{"text":"\"wohoo! As good as it gets\" definitely sums it up! I wasn't quite sure what to expect at the Amazing Cafe, but I have heard really good things about it, so last weekend we finally checked it out. On a Sunday around 11am it wasn't really that busy and it was easy for us to get a table. I ordered a coffee and the Smile French Toast and also here I didn't really know what to expect. I honestly can't even remember when I had vegan food the last time, but I was curious to try.   The french toast was absolutely amazing and came with coconut pumpkin cream, granola and a fruit compote. The colors, the presentation, the taste! I loved it and this was by far the best french toast I have had so far. It doesn't always have to be greasy, fatty and unhealthy. This was light, fresh, and so filling that I struggled to finish it all (but didn't want to leave anything on the plate). Considering that everything they sell is gluten free, vegan, GMO free, organic AND locally sourced their prices are very, very reasonable.  The atmosphere is so chill and laid back and the staff is so friendly as well. I really enjoyed it and can't wait to come back and try more items."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Summer Harvest, tulum tacos, and the peace pizza. Their juices and smoothies are also amazing.  I started coming here in June. I wanted to lose about thirty pounds, but I didn't want to give up the excitement of trying new foods or going out to lunch. This was the perfect place, with a lot of delicious options and a fun modern environment.  I'm now down 18 pounds and I think a lot of it was swapping 800 calorie fast food or 1500 calorie fried Asian noodle lunches for these super healthy options. I never leave hungry and I always leave satisfied and with a smile on my face."}
{"text":"Acai bowls were amazing and service was fast. The inside decor is nice and makes you feel happy and relaxed. The pricing was fair for the amount of food."}
{"text":"It really was amazing:) My son is usually an adventurous eater but he was finding that he didn't like 1 ingredient in each of the offers. He settled for a simple sandwich and loved it! I loved my wraps and coffee. When I ordered the chocolate cake at the end for myself, I knew that my son would probably end up eating most of it. That was the biggest hit:) We cannot wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Don't expect a quick or full-service experience. However, what you can expect is good vegan food made with care. I've been here twice, and both times have been great. I definitely recommend trying a smoothie - packed with healthy and tasty ingredients, thick, and refreshing.  On my last visit, I tried a smoothie bowl that was beautifully plated and very filling. 4/5 stars because service/ordering was a slow, but not unpleasant, experience. Also my friend got the breakfast tacos and, while the filling was hearty and delicious, the tortillas were on the bland and dry side."}
{"text":"Met a couple friends for Brunch on a Sunday morning around 11:30 AM.  All seats/tables were taken but after about 10 minutes there were plenty of seats/tables available.  I ordered the Green and Glow smoothie (Kale, Spinach, Banana, Apple, Almond Milk, Mint, Flax Seeds) and it was very tasty.  I tasted the kale a bit but mostly it was the banana and mint that came through.    I ordered \"Kindness\" (Potato Hash, Roasted Tomato, Mushroom, Tempeh, Greens, Miso Mayo) for my main dish but was fairly full from the Green & Glow smoothie that I couldn't finish this dish.  I really enjoyed the roasted veggies and was glad that it didn't have an overabundance of potatoes.  I'm not a huge fan of tempeh so could've done without that.  It was hearty, earthy, savory, fresh and flavorful.    Overall, everything was very delicious and filling.  I'd like to come back again and try some of their other smoothies and dishes."}
{"text":"Went with friends the first time and enjoyed it enough to schedule a work lunch here. Great fresh local ingredients and very chill and healthy vibe. A little pricey, but that may be par for the course for an organic place. I'd definitely recommend it for after a work out too - makes you feel like you're treating your body right!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here yesterday with my wife for brunch.  I had read about Amazing Cafe somewhere and after seeing all of the good reviews on Yelp, I had bookmarked it to try for bruch.  Other than knowing that I wanted to try it for brunch, my wife and I meandered in to the Amazing Cafe with little other knowledge of it.  My first impression of the cafe was that the inside was fairly unremarkable with a couple of chalboard menus, some high top tables and also some regular tables.  After quickly taking in the surroundings my wife and I looked around for a moment waiting to be seated until I noticed a big \"order here\" sign over top of a cash register.  So we proceeded over to the cashier and perused the chalkboard menu in front of us.  I think that they had 12 items on the menu of which 3 were only available for brunch while 3 more were only available Tues-Fri.  Since there was someone in line behind us my wife and I both ended up hurriedly ordering the Kindness (Potato hash, roasted tomato, mushrooms, tempeh, greens and miso \"mayo\").  I also asked for a glass of water and was shown where I could pour myself a cup and get my silverware and napkins.  With that done my wife and I took a seat while waiting for our food.  It was at this point that I started to look over the menu a bit more and noticed that the menu was completely vegetarian and it wasn't until I noticed the quotes around \"mayo\" from the kindness before I finally realized that we were in a vegan establishment.  I point this out not because I don't like vegan food but rather because they still had a decent selection of food on their limited menu.  While waiting for our food I started to look around the place a bit more and really enjoyed the quote on the wall that said something like \"I really wish I wouldn't have eaten healthy today\" --said no one ever.  After a reasonable period of time our food ended up coming out.  It looked pretty good as it came in a large bowl and was colorful from the red of the tomatoes and green of the greens.  Even though it had a great appearence I still wasn't expecting that much from it.  How wrong I was though as it was absolutely delicious!  I really enjoyed the miso \"mayo\" which I think gave a great spice to the dish and also liked the different varieties of mushrooms (3 I think) and greens (2).  The most surprising part of the dish for me was the tomatoes.  Getting me to eat a tomato is normally a tough sell as I don't really care for the flavor.  However since it was one of the main components on my dish I was obligated to try it and took a small piece.  I ended up being pleasantly surprised by the rather sweet and appealing flavor of it.  As a matter of a fact I ended up happily eating all of the tomatoes on my dish which I don't think that I have ever done before.  The potatoes and tempeh were also pretty good although at times it was tough to tell which was which until you put it into your mouth since they were both white and cubed to the same size.  By the time that I had finished eating I had once again happily joined the clean plate club.  My wife also became a member a short while later and was also pleased with her entree selection.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I have to admit that I was rather surprised by this place.  My initial thoughts were of the limited menu and the prices ($12 for the kindness) we were paying.  The longer that I sat there though the more that I warmed up to the place and in the end the spectacular food really won me over."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm the last city gal to have experienced Amazing Cafe...I also feel like that is a crime and I should be persecuted for it! I went yesterday with a few of my girlfriends and had one of the most flavorful salads i have ever had! I have to admit, I am always slightly weary of vegan restaurants.I love vegetables and don't exactly need cheese to have a good time. But sometimes i miss original versions while I eat their vegan counterparts. What I really look for in a vegan restaurant is simplicity and Amazing Cafe delivers that to me. I ordered the falafel salad and was blown away by the flavor!! So much dill and so many different veggies! The hummus was delectable and I thought it was very clever to turn the falafel into waffles! I would eat this salad every day and probably be a better person for it!"}
{"text":"What a gem in the Southside! This cozy little place has a great variety of vegan food that is local, healthy, AND delicious! I've visited a few times, and most recently had the Curry and the breakfast tacos (my sister and I shared) while the other two in our party shared the Peace Pizza and the Blackbean Wrap. Everything was a hit!  The curry had a good spice to it, with rice, veggies, and potatoes it was tasty and filling. The breakfast tacos were different than what I expected, but delightful. The Peace pizza was a hit - although I don't enjoy olives so the paste on it wasn't my speed. If you like olives, you'll love the pizza! Our pizza orderer is gluten free, so she loved that the dough was soft and tasty while still edible for her!  As for hot tea, they have a mug for $2, or the pot for $3. Go for the tea pot! I asked if they'd add more water to it half way through the meal and it wasn't a problem, so I had several (ok, like 5) cups of tea with my one pot.  Also, either start with or save room for the baked goods from Gluten Free Goat. We had ordered two of the chocolate pumpkin seed cookies and quickly went back for more (and some to go). We talked about trying something else, but they were so good we couldn't stray from them!"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore his place so much!! All of the ingredients are organic all natural and extremely fresh! Pittsburgh needs far more vegan places like this! It's pricy because youre paying for high quality ingredients so don't be deterred by that! Vegan heaven and there is something in it for everyone so make a stop! Pad Thai was delightful so was the arugula salad  and the pura vida smoothie made with dark cocoa and almond butter! Mmmmm"}
{"text":"My acai bowl came with the granola but there was no fresh fruit on top of the smoothie base. It was the acai smoothie base blended with the fruit and they gave me the granola on the side (I took it to go). The granola was okay - didn't have too much of a taste. The goji in the granola was very very chewy and dry. I would recommend them soaking their dried goji berries to make it taste better. The acai base was yummy though! Haven't tried their other menu items yet! Maybe I'll try ordering their acai bowl and ask for the fruit on top instead of blended in.  -----edit-----  Employee contacted me via Yelp to apologize for not including fruit. There should have been bananas and raspberries in the topping also. I will come back to try other menu items and edit my review once I do! I have increased my review from 3 stars to 4 stars due to their apology for the mistake."}
{"text":"Such an amazing place! I've always felt leaving energized and healthy after eating here. The peace pizza is definitely a stand out. I also credit this place completely for my obsession with turmeric tonics- YUM."}
{"text":"The more I go, the more I like it. As a Southside Slopes resident, I've been on the hunt for a good place to go regularly. Amazing Cafe's kind of become my coffee shop (even though I don't drink coffee).   The cafe is small, and I believe it's connected to a yoga place. I've never been to the yoga portion, but the cafe is really inviting with teal and blue walls, and artsy little vegan decorations everywhere (you know the kind of decorations that I'm talking about). I'm not vegan, but I am lactose intolerant, and it's been fun for me to eat here, since I know I won't ever get a stomachache from any surprise cream sauces or anything like that!   I recommend the breakfast tacos, and the Sunny Daze smoothie. I honestly bring my laptop sometimes, and I'll do work here for a few hours."}
{"text":"If you're feeling really really hungry but also want something incredibly healthy and guilt-free, Amazing Cafe is the place to go. Their portions are massive, so filling, and made with the best quality ingredients. They are great for breakfast, lunch, or if you just want to stop in to grab coffee or a fresh fruit/veggie juice to go. They do an amazing acai bowl, served in a large chilled bowl topped with tons of fresh fruit, nuts, and seeds. So refreshing and filling. The French toast is also one of my favorites, served with four large pieces of gluten free bread topped with fresh fruit and nuts, not overly sweet, and the nuts add the perfect crunch. They also have a lot of great lunch options, ranging from Thai noodles, salads, tacos etc. The restaurant is on the smaller size so be sure not to arrive right when a yoga class is let out. This is certainly the healthiest breakfast and lunch spot in Pittsburgh. Hopefully they can expand into other neighborhoods in the near future."}
{"text":"I had no idea this Vegan place cooked like a 5 star restaurant. As a long time Vegan I would have been satisfied with the basics but I was pleasantly surprised. I picked it because of the reviews and now I understand why they were so good. If you get a chance,  definitely check this place out !"}
{"text":"I base my review on comparable veg/vegan breakfast/lunch spots.   Very nice, helpful and knowledgable staff.  Solid menu with plenty of options for food, smoothie and beverage.  Warm inviting setting with hipster radio on the ready.   I enjoyed some solid tacos and freshly made ice tea. Extremely pleased and didn't feel like I had a ton of bricks in my stomach when I was done.   Comparable to San Diego fish tacos."}
{"text":"Tacos! Vegan tacos! They are so good, and I hear the breakfast tacos are even better. Amazing cafe, you lived up to your name.  Also, I don't like my green juices too sweet, they easily customized mine and took out half of the apple."}
{"text":"The food in the cafe is just like the yoga in the studio: it's healthy, a little Indian-inspired, but mostly it just makes you feel good.   This place had been on my mental bookmarks for a year, but I hadn't made it down because of the intimidation of E. Carson St. However, much like yoga, I really ought to introduce this into my daily routine.   The atmosphere: is calm, there's great music, the employees are smart and friendly and there are ample outlets under the pew if you need to work through lunch.   The food: is not what you'd expect. My Buddha Burger with fries came out on a bed of mixed greens and Cole slaw and I was not disappointed. It's huge and dressed in something so tangy and delicious that it makes eating the radishes and red onions a treat!   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"AMAZING find! Everything is fantastic! The tacos, Shwama and tuna salad! Yes! Next to a yoga studio that is affiliated.  Atmosphere is lovely and the people are friendly!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place for tasty vegan food! Enjoyed the vitality juice, French toast, and kindness bowl. Staff were all friendly and welcoming. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I was visiting from philly and wasn't expecting much in the way of health food from Pittsburgh. This place is great and as good as any vegan restaurant I've been to in many cities. I had the acai bowl for breakfast, which was done well, very creamy. Then I ordered the gluten free peace pizza which was delicious, just wish they had a vegan cheese option to add to it. The greens and beans soup was very flavorful, and I also had the spaghetti squash with pistachio ricotta? Amazing. When your fed up with shoveling primanti bros sandwiches down your throats give this place a try meat eaters and veggies, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My friend suggested that we try out this place after a 7 mile walk, wow! was that a good idea! What way better to replenish a sore body with some TLJ- tender love and juice that is! I ordered the \"After Party\" juice drink, how else could I pass up the apple, beet, lemon, and jalapeno combination?! Woo... how does one explain this drink? You just have to get it. There that's my description... no really, go now and pick up an \"after party\", then you will understand why it is hard to explain. There are no words that can describe what your mouth will feel. You take in a sip and it's like: \"Oh. Ah. Do I like this? Hm... Oh, yeah, I like this.\" You drink some more, then it becomes \"Oh, yes my taste buds (and body) are thanking me, I love this!\" I eyed up many other awesome descriptions of health foods that I would love to try in the future, one of which was a lavender donut/cookie of sorts (I forget exactly what it was, but I wanted it!) ...So maybe it's not the most healthy for a diet conscious gal like myself, but the ingredients are based on using the healthiest and freshest foods, so it's going to be made with better ingredients than your local bakery. I did think $5.50/small was a little steep for a juice, but I also understand that using real, organic ingredients isn't cheap and they did take extra time making mine, which was probably why it was so awesome, so I didn't mind. The question is: would I get a juice again? Probably not. I would go for a meal or a smoothie that has more packed into it for the cost. You can get a larger sized \"small\" smoothie compared to my really \"small\" juice size for $5 and soup for $6, so it isn't overpriced depending on what you get. I just got the smallest item for what seemed like a higher price, but you are fueling your body with a good product, so it all evens out. It's trial and error anywhere you go. I look forward to tasting some of their food items in the near future!"}
{"text":"This place it's AMAZING. I had the the grace sandwich and it had so much flavor. We definitely will be coming back again"}
{"text":"LOVED it here!  I ate lunch here for about a week while at AY teacher training and everything I had was delicious.  My favorite was the Goddess salad, the dressing is super yummy and it was super filling.  The vibe is bright and positive, definitely helped when it was 16 degrees out!"}
{"text":"As someone who is not a vegan or even a vegetarian, I cannot speak highly enough about the quality of food at Amazing Cafe.  The Peace Pizza is out of this world, with a blend of veggies and spices with so much flavor you will leave yearning for the next time.  The smoothie bowls are generous portions of wholesome goodness.  Honesty, some of the food is almost too pretty to eat...almost!  The Loco Moco Smoothie bowl topped with blueberries is my new go-to...think bananas blueberries strawberries cacao with granola, coconut chips etc...divine.  This place literally makes you feel good from the first step through the door.  My only wish is that they were open into the evening...unfortunately they close at 3:00...so I'm limited to the weekends...but if you can get there for a breakfast or lunch, do it!"}
{"text":"Came here late on a Saturday for brunch. Since one of my roommates is vegan, she was excited to try the place. I ended up ordering the Kindness, which is a hash of potatoes, mushrooms, tomatoes, tempeh, with a miso sauce. I also ordered a small pumpkin pie smoothie. Was surprised when the cashier said my total was $20.33 for just a smoothie and a hash, so definitely a little pricey.   Once we all ordered and got our table number we sat down and got our water and silver ware. It is a self service place pretty much. My pumpkin pie smoothie came out first and it was alright. Didn't really taste too much pumpkin pie flavors more just pumpkin and banana. The food came out pretty quickly. All the different components of Kindness were in a hefty sized bowl. I had never had tempeh before and really grew to like this soy, meaty life protein. Also the hash was very filling.   My one friend ordered the falafel and was happy with her meal. My other friend who is vegan ordered the Smile french toast and was excited to try french toast for the first time. Hers definitely looked the best and tasted pretty good too. Only complaint she had was that there was so much berry compote that she couldn't taste the other flavors. Overall, I liked the place but for the price I feel like I could have had a better brunch. Since I am not vegan, I do not think I appreciated the place as much."}
{"text":"I stopped in here today and this place stacks up to it's name - AMAZING!!!  This is one of my favorites !!  You walk in, and it is very zen.  Beautiful decor, and they cook right there in front of you.    I ordered a beet juice and also a new item that was recently added to the menu that was spaghetti squash, kale, romaine lettuce, chick peas, tomatoes, carrots and an amazing cashew ricotta !!!!   The food was so fresh, satisfying and delicious!!  The people who were working there was so friendly and helpful, and I will definitely be returning.  They have sweet parking but it is worth the drive around the block if it is busy !"}
{"text":"This place! This place is absolutely incredible. They have everything a gluten free fittie could dream of. Their menu changes which is nice because I love to try new things and I know it'll always be healthy and delicious. I've had their blueberry protein smoothie and enjoyed great conversation with the barista making it. I truly think it's one of the best clean eating spots in pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I always stay on the Southside of Pittsburgh when I travel for business and have been to Amazing Cafe twice. The menu is limited, but all the food is colorful, well-prepared and generously portioned. The smoothies are fresh and the tea is hot. I've always been on week nights, but the service is great. Attentive. I would possibly only subtract a star for menu choices, but hey....there are only so many vegetables to choose from:). A good distraction from the rest of the pizza/gyro/wing joints on Carson St."}
{"text":"The Amazing Cafe is a completely organic restaurant located in the 1500 block of East Carson St. The place is small but nicely arranged.  Since my visit was on a Sunday I could opt for the Sun brunch menu but the French toast I was hoping to order they were out of. I did learn you can order off the regular menu so I decided to have the green goddess salad.  This salad comes with arugula, candied walnuts,apples, vegan ricotta, carrot greens and goddess dressing. For drinks you can either order a juice cleanse, a smoothie, coffee, tea, or in my case I asked for an iced tea.  The ice tea they sell here with free refills is called honey bush red rooibos.  For some flavoring they gave me coconut palm sugar.  The lady who took my order was very nice and pointed to where I could sit down. I got my salad and was told by my waiter that they have a stand where you can get your stainless utensils as well as napkins. They salad was delicious with every bite! It wasn't overly huge but just enough.  I saw on the counter that they offer gluten free goat bakery food. I opted for the almond brownie since I didn't want a sugary donut. It was ok. She did tell me it was filling but because it was a large size it was just right for me.   When you are finished eating you take your dishes to a wash basin and leave them there. The prices are moderate since you are paying for organic food. I was also impressed with the decor since it is part of the yoga studio next door.   Before I left I asked when was the best time to visit and of course was given morning.  They are open only until 3 in the afternoon but it makes a great place when you are visiting the Southside for a lunch.  I am definitely interested in trying out their other offerings on a future visit. This truly is an Amazing Cafe!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and it was incredible. Friendly staff, delicious food, and the best mocha I've ever had. The tacos were great and it was a generous serving size - it was almost too much food for lunch! I absolutely love that everything is vegan because I have a dairy allergy and it's hard to eat out. I know I can eat here safely. I wish there were more places like this!"}
{"text":"I went to Amazing Cafe for brunch because I was impressed by all the vegetarian options. The name says it all - Amazing Cafe is amazing! I ordered the Smile french toast, and it was delicious. I would definitely come back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"First time at the Amazing Cafe today. I got one of the green juices and it was SO good. be aware that if you don't either bring your own mason jar or plan to drink in the restaurant you will have to purchase a mason jar for $2.00. Loved it though and am excited to get back and try the food!"}
{"text":"True vegan. Nothing strange, just fresh pure food. Had the peace pizza. Can't wait to have it again!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! As a vegetarian and someone who is always looking for healthy eats, I'm so glad I discovered this place. They take vegan food to another level. So delicious and you can enjoy it without the guilt. I've heard great things about their smoothie bowls so I had to try one of those bad boys out. I ordered their Loco Moco which is currently their special. It is similar to the Divine but it has an added chocolate twist - um, yes please! The smoothie is topped with chia seeds, coconut flakes, cacao chips, granola, and bananas. Incredible and super filling - highly recommend! I will definitely be back to try out other items on their menu. I'm officially obsessed!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try Amazing Cafe for so long, before I actually did. I went there for lunch with a friend, and was not disappointed. The atmosphere was lovely, and the staff super friendly. I ordered the Buddha Burger; it was very tasty and came on a huge salad. The beverages are authentic, fresh and delicious. The space is clean and has lovely decorations. An extra star for the fact that they use local produce. However, Amazing Cafe loses a star for being a little overpriced, and they close way too early every day."}
{"text":"Thank you, Amazing Cafe, for providing us with the cleanest and healthiest food during our visit to Pittsburgh. You made my belly happy and gave it a nice respite between all those veggie burgers, seitan wings, and beer.   My husband and I were visiting from SoCal for a good friend's wedding and were staying with other friends in the South Side. When I started looking on Yelp for vegan and vegetarian options, Amazing Cafe immediately caught my eye. While I love mock meats, it's also nice to eat food more like what I'd cook at home -- things like tempeh, fresh veggies, and lots of greens. Amazing Cafe has all of that, and they are even able to appeal to hardcore meat eaters -- impressive!   We came here for brunch, and I ordered the Kindness bowl. It was flavorful, fresh, filling, and healthy. Finally, a meal where I didn't feel weighed down and bloated after eating! As a strict vegetarian who tries to eat vegan as much as possible, I often find it hard to have options other than veggie burgers, overdressed salads, or fried stuff. Amazing Cafe offers real, healthy, organic, good food at a very fair price. And they're able to accommodate gluten-free diets, too. Do your body some good and eat here!"}
{"text":"I am amazed by Amazing Cafe. Okay, more like obsessed! Guys... This is the jam for healthy eats. Healthy eats that aren't bland. Healthy eats that are delicious in every bite!   I've only been a couple times since discovering it, so I've only had a couple of items, but I'm convinced everything must be good! I've had their juices, which are delicious. I've had their smoothie, which was awesome (the chocolate one!) and I've had their Acai Bowl, which is my go to breakfast item. Plus, you can't beat their always friendly and warm staff.  I'd love to see this place open earlier for coffee/tea and a nice place to work and have meetings. They currently open at 11am, but have a full juice and espresso bar, so I'd only imagine (and hope) that it's a matter of time.  It's great to have a healthy obsession. Especially this one!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite veggie-friendly brunch place in Pittsburgh, hands down.  The fact that Amazing Cafe is \"healthy\" and \"vegan\" is a bonus, but hardly its most notable feature: it serves food that is beyond flavorful.  I can't recommend the Buddha burger enough-- it's a super-moist house-made patty with a drizzle of different piquant sauces, with sides of freshly-dilled pickles, crunchy slaw, and a side salad-- each with distinct flavors.  So freakin' good.  For brunch, the Smile (french toast) and especially the Kindness (potato scramble) options are excellent too.  I can't wait to try the rest of the menu.    If I ruled the world, I would transform this noisy, functional cafe into a sit-down restaurant with an atmosphere as peaceful as the food.  Even so, I plan to forego many fancier weekend lunches and brunches in the future for some of the tastiest food around at this place."}
{"text":"We like everything, and want everyone at home to experience what they have to offer!   The smoothies are super good and so is their food.   It is Saturday so they don't have what I was hoping to order but that's okay...their peace pizza was incredible. Heidi had the Divine. Omg sooo good!   Their menu changes seasonally, I want to try everything!  Construction on my route is a obstacle and parking is a pain, but once all that is out the way...it's totally worth the stress. If we were in walking distance, meals would never be a mystery and the family would be in the greatest of health!"}
{"text":"Great little place, staff was super helpful with all my questions about what it was all about and what everything was. The vegan chili was SUPER tasty, even for a meat lover like myself. French press coffee and iced tea was very good. I had the kindness potato hash and It was very filling and had lots of flavor in it. The smoothie bowl was super good with the buckwheat granola and the Chia seeds and fresh fruit on it. The berries were frozen but beautiful but made eating it with a spoon an sensitive tooth person cringe! I loved the place ,little pricey but I can see me returning with no hesitation."}
{"text":"The food is fresh, tasty and presented nicely! Everyone that works here is great and down to earth! I highly recommend their brunch!"}
{"text":"Good, healthy menu. Buddha burger and Tulum tacos were decent. Nice cafe to hang out at."}
