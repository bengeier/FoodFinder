{"text":"The Place To Be has been around forever and the service is good! Our waitress refilled the coffee even before it was half empty, every time. The food is just okay, though. Bland and just not that great. I order the Gyro, which comes with a small bowl of soup. Although I order it every time I go in, neither were anything to write home about (unless Yelp is home). That's bad. Okay....

Sit down with the expectation that you're eating in a small, old Lakewood diner and you'll be happy enough. At least it's a nice change of pace from the chains and burger joints."}
{"text":"It''s a nice diner for going to when you're hungober, food is quick, it's good, and cheap. Cash only, but they were nice enough to let me go out to an atm and come back"}
{"text":"Great place use to live down the street and would always go there on the weekend for breakfast. Great food well priced and fast service. So don't worry if there is a line out the door."}
{"text":"It's Ohio. You know, a land where casseroles reign supreme. I didn't know what to expect. I set the expectation metric low. 

I was surprised. 

The food was great. The portions were ample. The food had flavor. Real flavor. 

I got the Irish Skillet; I would again."}
{"text":"It's a diner. Great diner food without hip pretensions and gimmicks. This place does it right with breakfast all day along with the regular menu. Service is professional. The servers are people who are over 21 and aren't more concerned with how cool they look than whether your coffee cup is full. Thankfully no changing tables in the restrooms. I don't want to smell it or even imagine it in my eating place. Diners aren't for infants. Find a Chuckie Cheese. The prices don't make you wince in pain. It ain't The Four Seasons and doesn't try to be, so get your nose out of the air and enjoy classic American comfort food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I've been coming here with my boyfriend probably about once a month for years, and before that I've been coming pretty regularly for most of my life. I'll never stop coming to this diner! I've only ever really had their breakfast food, and it's fantastic. I love the pancakes and the omelettes. The service is fantastic and friendly. They're very good at what they do. There are lots of breakfast places in Lakewood, and while I do enjoy going to many of them, I keep coming back to The Place to Be."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite and equally long standing breakfast and lunch spots in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch the other day and had the Gyro.  It tasted fantastic and the serving was so big I ended up taking half of it home and eating it for dinner. Great food at an affordable price. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Love the place to be. Prices very reasonable, waitresses are great and the food is just what you want. Nothing fancy, just regular breakfast fare, well prepared."}
{"text":"Wow! I love little family owned diners, they always have the greatest breakfast and always cheap, but this is a new favorite. Place To Be has cooks that can actually cook an egg correctly, I know it seems simple but I order over-medium and never get it. This place is clean, service is fast and friendly...  Breakfast is my favorite but they have great lunch/dinners to offer as well."}
{"text":"This seems to be the place to go to in Lakewood for breakfast and brunch. Service is quick and efficient, typical for any given greasy spoon diner. Menu offerings are typical for breakfast with regards to eggs, sausage, ham, waffles, pancakes, etc, but does have a special/seasonal menu with their typical fare

With my first visit, I was recommended the gyro skillet by my waitress. It really wasn't impressive. was just a breakfast salad of potatoes, gyro meat, some peppers, eggs?, all mixed up. I couldn't figure out why it was a thing. Maybe it was a one-off, so I visited again and ordered the special peaches and waffle and sausage. Not sure what happened, but the order got totally botched. They gave me bacon instead, and the server decided to look at her pad to make sure I was wasn't wrong before having me pick up the bacon with my hands and put it on the dish to take back. She did trade me for an extra sausage link for my trouble. Then waffle was just a waffle with canned peaches dumped on top. The menu advertised whipped cream with the waffle, which I looked around the waffle, and couldn't find any. To add insult to injury, I got overcharged for the order, since she assumed the price was the same compared to another different waffle dish and didn't really bother to recalculate the bill when I brought it up. Not once was there an apology for any of the mistakes.

I really wanted to like this establishment, since there were so many glowing reviews. I'm also one to focus on the food and flavors, and I couldn't care less about service, coming from a Chinese background being used to the low standards of Chinese restaurant service. However, the standard set here really sets a new low with regards to accuracy of getting the order right and the unapologetic service for all of the mistakes made even for American standards. By all means, I'm sure the traditional breakfast offerings are all right, if I went down that route, but I can't justify myself returning here again to find out if that's even true."}
{"text":"Greek omelette FTW! Got unique?"}
{"text":"I come to The Place to Be whenever I'm in town.  Delicious corn beef hash and quick service.  I only wish they had sourdough toast.

I have never been to Melt, because why would I go there when there's The Place to Be?"}
{"text":"So good! Been going there since I was little this place is the best friendly people awesome food that is so quick and hot! Try the breakfast burrito! So good"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for breakfast in the last couple weeks and have yet to be disappointed. The server we have had, wish I knew the name, has always been fantastic. She isn't too overbearing, and she isn't too absent despite usually being the only server very early in the morning. She is always on point with refills and checking back with you even when it's busy.

As for the food, it has great taste and value. I tried the pancakes my gal-pal got and they were awesome. So awesome I had to come back a few days later just to order them specifically. They are really filling even if you get a short stack. The batter is crazy, I get this taste of vanilla or something that's added to it that really makes it taste awesome. Always gotta get the home fries with ketchup. 

Besides that, I've really only gotten that one where you get eggs, home fries, a meat, toast and juice for like 8$ or something. Tastes great and came out quick. Definitely would like to have an omelette next time.

So yeah. Cash only, but you can get quite a bit of quality made food for a good price. I'm leaving it at a very high 4 for now with a 5 pending when I stop in for lunch one of these days and try some other stuff. The turkey bacon club has been calling my name lately...."}
{"text":"I love the Place to Be! Their club sandwich is awesome. Love their gyros! I wish that I lived closer. The one on Smith just isn't the same."}
{"text":"Mmm... Absolutely the best! No one makes an omlette like the Place To Be! Consistently good food and service. I love that I can go with girlfriends and they don't rush you out."}
{"text":"Wonderful little old-school diner, very nostalgic vibe to it and a great menu, plus all day breakfast. The waitresses/waiters are great as well. Only actual downside is that they are cash only, however there is an ATM inside. (At a $2.50 cover fee.)"}
{"text":"Consistently good food. Cheap. And I think one of the gals there is crushin on me."}
{"text":"Might be the best diner in the city.  Excellent breakfast.  Omelettes, french toast, pancakes all good.  Typical diner menu.

Service is very good."}
{"text":"tucked in a little corner of downtown lakewood where you'd probably miss it if you weren't looking, the place to be sits and waits for you to take notice.

this is a homey breakfast stop.  families come here, regulars come here, and you should too.  cheap eats for breakfast, and the food isn't super greasy. good eggs.  filling hash browns.  

and if you're weird like me and like to eat breakfast food at other times in the day...they serve breakfast all day.

it's kinda small, and they pack 'em in on the weekends.  
...that's what she said.
snuck that one in there.

but check this place out."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday, and boy was it crowded. I thought I was going to have to wait at first, but there ended up being a table shoved in the way back - and by shoved, I mean shoved. We were right in front of the door for the kitchen, and I felt like my boyfriend was going to get hit by dishes every time the bus boy went by. I also hit my head really hard on the coat rack that was above us when I was getting ready to leave - like I said, not a good place for a table. 

I was really looking forward to eating here seeing all of the great reviews on Yelp - and I was a little disappointed. It's your typical, small diner in regards to food and quality of food/service. Besides being shoved in the back corner (where there was no business being a table in the first place - or at least not a 4-top, maybe a 2-top), the menu was huge and had a lot of variety. However, it was just run-of-the-mill diner food - nothing really blew me away. We had a few different waitresses stop by our table at the beginning, resulting in confusion about what we had ordered to drink. I got the Tex-Mex skillet, which was good - the potatoes were the best part, and I also got an English muffin with it - which was a little crispy on the ends, but nothing some grape jelly couldn't cover up. If I were to come back, I would try to come back on a non-holiday weekday."}
{"text":"Since moving to Lakewood I have been very pleased with the number of diners I've been able to try in the area. First George's in West Park, then Michael's in Rocky River, and now The Place to Be.

All were similar in that they served better-than-average breakfast fare at lightening speeds with exceptional service. The Place to Be stands out, unfortunately, in only one way from the others, and that is that it is cash only. Hence the four stars instead of five.

Coffee wasn't bad, but non-dairy creamer always freaks me out a little bit.

I will visit again! Probably to try the Greek omelette (with gyro meat) or the corned beef hash. Today I ordered the vegetable omelette with American cheese and it was really good.

Interior was a bit depressed looking and dingy. But it has character."}
{"text":"This diner is open for breakfast and lunch. It is CASH ONLY. This is a slightly more expensive diner with dishes totaling between $8-10. With that said you get a large heaping plate of good food. The service is quick and the menu is large. Seat yourself and be ready to order in under 2 minutes."}
{"text":"Great little diner. It had a great feel to it. It's tucked away on a side street right off of Lakewood's downtown main drag, Detroit.

The first thing you notice when you walk in is how clean the place is. Right away I felt great about it because of the cleanliness factor. It's always the best first impression!

The menu is the perfect size. They have all the basics, regular breakfast plates, omelettes, skillets and benedicts. I chose the country biscuit and eggs with choice of meat. The biscuits and gravy were awesome. That along would be a satisfying meal. The biscuit isn't dry (I've had some that are dry even covered in gravy) you could tell they're made fresh. The gravy was thick and creamy with huge chunks of sausage. You also get two eggs any style and a choice of meat. They had everything from bacon to turkey sausage to ham steak.

We went at 9:30 and was able to get a booth right away. I'm not sure how busy this place gets but it's a great local spot for breakfast. 

Before you go: CASH ONLY! However, there is an ATM on site in case you forget."}
{"text":"My younger daughter and I needed to be in the area on a Sunday morning, and I had been wanting to give this place a try...so this was our chance!

We were seated near the back (in a booth) in this lively little spot on the side of Detroit Avenue. 
 Wow...what a great find!  They have great breakfast fare with a huge menu of items to choose from and/or customize to your heart's content.  It appears that many (if not all) the servers, counter-folks and kitchen staff are related and the family vibe shows through in theor comfortable demeanor.

I ordered a breakfast platter with eggs, choice of meat and pancakes.  I am not usually a pancake guy, but a little voice inside my head told me to do it, and boy am i glad i listened to that little voice!  Their pancakes are malty and perfectly moist with a slight sweetness (before butter and syrup) that totally hit the mark.  The bacon was cooked crispy (just the way I ordered it), along with two runny / gooey over easy eggs.  And their coffee was not too shabby either (and kept on flowing!).

I know others have mentioned it here, but be aware that they are a CASH ONLY establishment, so come prepared.  So glad we finally got here to give them a go, and I can assure you it will not be our last!"}
{"text":"I will not eat anywhere that serves instant potatoes. That tells me the owners do not care about the product they serve. Just my peeve."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time and loved it. The Greek skillet was phenomenal. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Great greek diner food. I had a giant chef salad and my mom had a huge tuna sandwich. Great prices, big portions, good food. Fast service, but be sure you bring cash, they don't take credit cards."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Sunday morning breakfast spots.  The service is great.  The food is prepared quick.  I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"The Place to Be is a small diner in Lakewood.  You can tell right from walking in that it is a family owned restaurant and the staff takes great care in remembering who it's regulars are(in fact, they might have found a couple new regulars in my boyfriend and I with our recent visit).

We went for breakfast, I had just got done working night shift so I was very hungry, and we were not disappointed.  We were seated right away and given menus, and they were very extensive menus.  I chose the pancakes and some hashbrowns and my boyfriend chose one of the skillets.

It didn't take long for our food to come.  They gave me a big container of warm syrup for my pancakes.  I was surprised that the pancakes were rather yellow when I cut into them, but looks aside, they were absolutely delicious.  I could get a strong taste of vanilla when I bit into them.  They were a very generous portion (I was starving after my shift so I was able to eat ALL of it).  The hashbrowns weren't bad, I just think they could have used a little more seasoning.  

The service was perfect, they weren't too overbearing.  They showed up just the right amount to ask us how our meals were and to refill drinks.  Sometimes that's a better service approach because it allows you to enjoy your meal a little bit more 

The only thing that's keeping me from giving this place a five star review is that they only accept cash payments.  I'm not sure if there are certain logistics of being able to accept debit/credit card payments, but that's not enough to keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"Cool little place. I've been here a few times and everything tastes like a home cooked meal. The wait staff could be a little more attentive with refills and stopping.by to drop off your check as the last time I was there we had to wait about 20 mins to get our check (which is the only thing holding me back from 5 stars). It is cash only but they have an ATM on site and you pay for your food at the register (just an FYI to avoid the awkward stage of waiting on them to pick up your payment)"}
{"text":"Came here for some brunch food, and the food is so-so. The waitress we had was rude and got my order wrong. She corrected the problem, but made it seem like I didn't know what I was ordering... it was just a ham and cheese sandwich. Food is cheap, but the portion size is really small.  You definitely get what you pay for, but not much more than that."}
{"text":"Service is good. Food is ok. Only thing is that it feels a bit dirty in there so I don't like going there often. Plus it's cash only (thumbs down)"}
{"text":"Very nice breakfast place.  Traditional diner items.  Doesn't accept credit cards, but there is an atm in the place.  Chicken fried steak is especially good.  Close parking near by, free parking in the mornings and weekends."}
{"text":"Gyro platter is where it's at. 

The place looks a little sketchy from the outside and I probably wouldn't have tried it without he recommendation of others. I'm really glad I did!

Cheap eats and decent coffee make this a place I keep going back to. The service is always good and quick, even when I do takeout."}
{"text":"Very happy I took my daughter to breakfast here. The food was plenty and the service was rather awesome. My coffee was always full and my daughter loved the pancakes. I will definitely keep this one on the list of favorites for breakfast. Will have to try lunch sometime in the future."}
{"text":"Very quick.  Friendly servers.  Keeps the coffee cup full.  Diff be back.  Place very clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"This is a great Lakewood family restaurant!  Open for Breakfast and Lunch.  I have been here plenty of times.  It's my uncle Frank's fav!   It is always busy there due to its popularity!!  Wait was about 5 minutes. I had the Greek Omelet made with Spinach, Mushrooms, Onions, Green Peppers and Feta Cheese!  Coffee was smooth and nice and hot!  My mom has hi made sausage and gravy!  Gravy was smooth and spicy!   This place was hopping with waitresses and hosts working hard to serve us all.  Great customer service!!!!  Place is a bit small.  Too bad they can't expand or relocate!  But all in all its a great Place To Be!!!"}
{"text":"Cool little diner/restaurant in the middle of Lakewood.  
Great place for breakfast; it's always served well and quickly.  They are Greek-owned and have a number of menu items featuring gyro meat.
Service has always been great with rapid refills on coffee."}
{"text":"Got the ultimate BLT, for my food and didn't have any bacon on it. I had to get up to find my server to let her know. Horrible service. Once they serve you they don't come back to make sure you are enjoying your meal. Will never be coming back."}
{"text":"Best breakfast food in the state of Ohio... possibly the entire country. Fast service too."}
{"text":"Definitely a little hole in the wall. My husband, son, and I loved it. We love little mom and pop type breakfast joints and this spot did not disappoint. The food was prepared quick, came out hot, and tasted delicious. I defiantly recommend."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, but the service is good, and the food comes out fast!  Don't waste your time on the biscuits and gravy.........pure starch, and very little sausage.  The hash browns are also bland, but it's a good place to go for breakfast if you are hungry and just want something fast."}
{"text":"What a refreshing change from the chains.  A delightful little place with really good, home cooking. I had an italian sausage sub that was superb. Family also reported having had great food. All the sandwiches are very reasonably priced and come with fries and home made soup! Pies looked really good but we were all too full to get any. The waitress was a very charming greek grandma who was terrific with the kids."}
{"text":"Meh.  It's typical diner food.  Great service, great prices, great portions...but definitely not the most outstanding dining experience ever."}
{"text":"Love this place! 

Cash only but it's such a good breakfast joint. Very basic, nothing mind blowing or super unique, but it's a solid product for a very low price. The staff is always very nice and pleasant. I've never been disappointed by this place."}
{"text":"This was my favorite diner when I lived in Cleveland for 2 years. Their breakfasts come out quick and are always extremely good. Their egg white omelettes are some of the best I have ever had and the service is great."}
{"text":"Biscuits and gravy, eggs over easy & bacon. Enough said! Great little dinner with amazing service and atmosphere. Definitely \"the place to be\" for breakfast in Lakewood."}
{"text":"This place makes me feel warm inside. If life's got you down, The Place To Be will lift you back up with their food, staff, and ambiance."}
{"text":"Fun cheap and pretty good Diner Restaurant... Great nice staff.   USed to sit for hours drinking coffee with my best friends! how great!"}
{"text":"The Place to Be is hands down the best traditional breakfast spot in NE Ohio. My familly has been coming here since 1989 and we've never been disappointed. My personal favorite are any of their omelets, the Greek being my favorite. They have added skillets as well as various eggs benedicts all which are stellar in execution. Try them, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The Place To Be is a local diner in the Lakewood area that people have been going to for years.  I went last Sunday prior to church with my beau and his dad.  I'd never been before and I can't say I've been missing much.  

The diner is old, while clean, it is old.  Service was prompt and your typical diner gal service, \"What can I getchya?\".  Coffee is crap (not unexpected) and the menu boasts traditional diner fare.  

I ordered 2 eggs, toast, and bacon.  It came with hash and I was happy and satisfied with what I ordered.  Toast comes out prior to your meal, so if you prefer it warm & with your meal, ask when you order for it to be brought with your meal.

Prices are to be expected and I couldn't complain.

Would I go again, sure.  Would I make a special trip, nah.  I wasn't impressed overall and I can get diner food closer to home."}
{"text":"Both take-out and dine-in are a good experience! I'm a fan of the chocolate chip pancakes, but their Belgian waffles are also amazing. We like this place enough that we walked there in a blizzard! Pretty enjoyable overall. They don't accept credit cards, so be prepared."}
{"text":"Prices are not just what this place has going for it! A close second is the food, it's not bad folks! A third highlight is the estimated time of wait from order to delivery, its faster than most drive thrus! That's probably because I get the basic breakfast with two eggs, hash browns, choice of meat and toast. I swear it comes out faster than I have received my food from anywhere else. And in the morning is the best time to receive it quick! From order to my belly in 10 minutes or less."}
{"text":"The breakfast is awesome large portions, the coffee is good the price is right . Fast service. I eat hear often  it's cash only big breakfast menu the skillets are the best"}
{"text":"This is your typical greasy spoon serving up huge portions of food for a great price.  The service is extremely fast.  The menu is filled with standard diner fare like omlettes, gyros, country fried steak, etc.

This is my go-to place for an omlette."}
{"text":"Love this Little Jem here in Lakewood!  Awesome Food and Awesome Servers! ! Try it out you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very close to my work. Called in a order for pick up. Was ready in 10 minutes. Omelette was delicious. Portion was generous. Price was great. Co-workers are going to be using the menu they gave me. I will be ordering from here regularly from now on."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast and Diner in Lakewood!  Not the sexiest place, but its a diner, its not suppossed to be.  

Quick and Friendly Service and they keep the coffee flowing."}
{"text":"Love this place! We take the family all the time! The breakfast is so fast and delicious! My favorite meal is the gyro. A huge amount of meat and cucumber sauce is great!"}
{"text":"Everyone around town knows this place and there is a reason why. I can't picture a better place to get your breakfast or brunch. 

It is a small place that reminds me of so many older diners that I have visited. The food is cheap and plentiful. Any breakfast food?  You can't miss with your choice. From French toast to eggs to pancakes, it is all good. 

If you like small, intimate diners where you can converse with your waitress then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"My new favorite place for breakfast.  Tried for the first time on Saturday.  Liked it so much I came back on Sunday.  Large menu, attentive wait staff, counter service, eggs over medium cooked perfectly, good coffee."}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago with a friend after a Saturday night at the bars and this was exactly what I wanted! 

A place that isn't going to judge you for how you look and is going to treat you like you have been family for years.  For going during a prime breakfast rush we were lucky enough to get a table right as we walked in, right by the window to watch people outside and it was perfect. 

I ordered one of their 'breakfast specials' with eggs, hashbrowns, sausage and a pancake on the side and my friend ordered an Omelet and we had no complaints, and demolished it all.  Everything was done exactly how it would be at home and the staff is extremely friendly.  With my meal I got a coffee and a juice but I only ordered coffee and my friend got juice so she was nice enough to include her juice as part of my meal.  

It's the quick service, homemade breakfast you crave every morning when you don't want to cook it for yourself.  I will definitely be back and do suggest everyone give it a try.  I came after someone recommended it to me for fabulous biscuits and gravy, while that is not my meal of choice I would expect them to be nothing but amazing!"}
{"text":"I travel a lot and I always stop here after I leave the Cleveland airport. Usually I get breakfast and it's always very affordable and delicious. They have tons of specials every day and have different things like potato pancakes and gyro and corned beef omelets and skillets. I especially like how they offer two egg omelets because it's just the right portion for me. Their homefries and coffee really hit the spot too. The staff is just as welcoming and friendly as you'd expect in a diner style place. I always look forward to going here. Just note they only take cash!"}
{"text":"So if you were asked to look up iconic Lakewood eatery, you will find your search takes you to The Place to Be.  
The Gyro is legendary as evidenced by the girl at the end of the counter who spent about 3 minutes parsing her food in an attempt to roll the pita closed and eat it like it was just any ol' gyro... She eventually gave in and picked up the knife and fork to eat it the way  a true veteran already knows is the proper protocol for such an epic sandwich.  The corned beef hash is in my opinion waaaayyyy better than the world famous hash from Big Al's in Shaker Hts., but you have to ask for an egg on top for a fair comparison.  You won't be disappointed with anything you order related to breakfast, corned beef or gyro. As for the rest of the menu, I can't really say as I don't stray too far from the tried and true.  (And don't worry, they won't slap you if you mispronounce Gyro!)"}
{"text":"Recently spent a week in the area and ate multiple times during all three meal times. Very friendly and quick service. Kitchen is exceptional fast with orders. Portions large and flavorful. Large Breakfast menu. Excellent omelets and pancakes.Coffee definitely a cut above normal Restraurant coffee. Owner & family are hands on and very attentive to customers. Food ingredients ---fresh and of premium quality. Prices very reasonable for portion size and quality of food. Daily specials for all meal times. The Place to Be is the Deli concept at its finest. Convenient and ample parking. Cash only. ATM on premises."}
{"text":"It truly is what the name claims. 

On a rainy Monday morning, we stumbled upon it, as it was the only spot full with people. 

The host and waitress both kindly welcomed us and got our order in quickly. The Veggie Omelette was amazing and came with potatoes and toast, and I ordered pancakes as well. It was too much food for one person, but I ate as much as I could and love every bite. 

Definitely a good, simple breakfast spot."}
{"text":"No frills, nothing fancy. Cheap Breakfast location. CASH ONLY.

Although the food is just average, you get what you pay for so you cant complain about that.

I visited The Place To Be for breakfast when I wanted to try something new (there are so many brunch options in Lakewood). It was an outdated diner style restaurant with classic breakfast options. With all the trendy, hip options that seem to be popping up everywhere, it is surprisingly refreshing to find a breakfast joint with an old school atmosphere. Sometimes you just want the tried and true pancake & bacon breakfast without spending a fortune and this is exactly what you will get here."}
{"text":"This place got the job done. 

We left full and happy after eating a chicken sandwich, veggie omelette, and pancakes. The server was very nice and friendly and we were in and out in under an hour. The outside of the building is a bit dated and the bathroom was almost too small to enter, but the overall experience is four stars."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, and a reasonable price, what's not to like. The corned beef sandwich is excellent, as are the gyros. The breakfast menu is massive. The Place to Be has been doing it right for years."}
{"text":"Quick seating, excellent service, specials, reasonable prices. Clean restaurant, not really noisy. My daughter had excellent broccoli, spinach and cheddar cheese omelet. I had egg whites which came with homefries and toast. Prices are competitive and they seem to have a loyal following. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've been to this diner quite a few times, it's your average American diner and plus more. It's not the prettiest of places but don't judge a book by it's cover because it certainly gives you great service, food, and hospitality for it's prices.

The servers that work there certainly do seem to care about what they do and will always serve you fresh coffee when your out, tell you about the specials, soup of the day, and desserts.

All the food is rather excellent for the price you are paying for. I order the Gyro Salad or the Greek Salad all the time, it's really delicious served with a side of tzatziki, large portions, so you better come hungry.

Great place, I'll always be coming in whenever I can."}
{"text":"Best breakfast has to be their Gyro Omelet! It is served fresh, fast and with friendly service and a great price."}
{"text":"Nice little diner for a quick breakfast! Friendly staff and you get served quickly. It is cash only but they have an atm there!"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday with my parents and daughter. Of course it was busy. The host told us it would be 10 minutes, however we waited about 20-25. When we sat down the waitress seemed stressed out. We ordered waters coffee and a chocolate milk for my daughter. We waited about 10-15 for drinks. A different waitress came by for our order. My mom ordered an egg white omelet that ended up coming out wrong. We didn't say anything. The waitresses seemed so stressed because it was busy. I noticed an eye roll or two. The food was good. If I were to come again it would be a weekday when it wasn't so busy."}
{"text":"This is not the place to be if u want chopped sirloin. Chopped....sirloin.....is a hamburger patty??? Since when??? Food was not seasoned. Really disgusting. Never eating here again."}
{"text":"The Place To Be lives up to its name.  If you go on a Saturday or Sunday, it's packed with people, but they get you seated pretty quickly. 

The food is great by diner standards; cheap, greasy and yummy! I had the Ultimate Skillet. It was very full of flavor and delicious. The service was very good. I love that it's a family-owned and run restaurant and how most of the workers speak Greek to each other. 

It is cash only, so make sure to leave your credit cards at home."}
{"text":"Quick, good, classic breakfast food. They give a good portion for the cost. Many servers who are very attentive. Only downfall is cash only."}
{"text":"No credit cards. As just about everyone else has said. Parking is metered till 6pm. Not a good place to take the kiddies,  if they are of diapering age. No changing tables in the bathrooms. Other than that. I have been coming to this place for about 15 years now. And love the gyro platter. Soooo much for so little. One order is more than enough for 2 people. We usually order one, and get an extra pita bread. Have to take a star for canned gravy for biscuits and gravy :("}
{"text":"The absolute BEST place for breakfast in Lakewood. Omelets are fantastic and portions are large. Worth the wait on weekend mornings!"}
{"text":"This hole-in-the-wall is the best breakfast spot in Lakewood, hands down. The servers are very prompt and attentive, and the food is good and affordable. I always recommend this diner to anyone who comes in from out of town. Just make sure to stop at the ATM, they are cash only!"}
{"text":"This really is the Place to Be.  I personally hit this place up on Sunday's after a hard night of drinking, for a few reasons... 

1. The Food - It's just what you need to soak up booze, and it's cheap! 
2. The Staff - Lets face it.. when you are hungover you don't want to be seen or talk to people.. you want to sit down, get your coffee and eat.  That's what happens here, the staff doesn't want to talk much either. 
3. The Location - It's tucked right on the side of Detroit, very close to downtown, and depending where you were the night before might be near where you left you car.. not that I'd ever do that.... 

Important to Note - Doesn't take cards!  You need cash.  There is an ATM inside but for some reason it refuses my card every time."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to this restaurant based on great reviews of omelets. Unfortunately the omelette I ordered was covered in oil, and I mean to the point where I was dabbing it with my napkin and the bottom of the plate was pooling with oil when I was done eating it. The fruit is not very fresh. Service is good, coffee is watery."}
{"text":"Love coming here for Breakfast in the center of Lakewood. Portions are huge and very filling. Prices are extremely reasonable, but beware- CASH ONLY and be prepared to wait for a table on weekend mornings."}
{"text":"Cash only, ehhh....Well I went here in the afternoon for breakfast food. Corned beef hash was a tad salty, but decent portions. Small diner, nothing fancy by any means. The burgers looked good though!"}
{"text":"hi im steven  was i suprise thatthis tiny little place is so cozy i neverknew this place had the best  homomade POTATO PANCAKES yes thet are truly favored with spices they are simply amzing  go outthier and try this outstanding potat pancakes"}
{"text":"Having a place to go for cheap good food is a rarity.

Having a place that has been around for my entire life, is impossible.

While I no longer live in Lakewood, I do frequently visit family in the area. The Place to Be is always a favorite breakfast stop. Large portions of delicious breakfast goods at a decent price. It's a perfect morning ending to a night of Lakewood bar crawling.

I've never had a cup of coffee that was ever less than half full. I've never left hungry. I've never spent more than $15 a person."}
{"text":"This really is the \"place to be\" we had 2 different types of omelets, mine with egg whites. Both came with hash browns and toast. So delicious- fresh veggies and thick cut meat. Great taste- good coffee, good service. You really can't ask for much more. Do yourself a favor and stop in."}
{"text":"The Place To Be is definitely a place you might want to be for brunch and lunch. With reasonably priced options and friendly service, this place is definitely a great spot for brunch.

I went with a few friends on a Sunday for brunch and even coming at around 10:00, there were plenty of tables available (although there was a slight wait when we left after 11:00 AM). We were given plenty of time to study the extensive menu and our orders were taken efficiently allowing for separate checks without issue. The place is cash only, so do be aware of that when arriving.

Our food arrived promptly and was quite good for a diner and at the price points given. Our coffees were always full and I'm not sure it even went below a half cup with the numerous servers coming by. 

Bottom line, if you're looking for a good diner, The Place To Be definitely marks off the expectations with reasonable prices, good food, and friendly service. Don't expect to be absolutely blown away, but hey... for what you get, this is definitely at least one place you would want to be."}
{"text":"Totally solid diner, with a diverse menu, but the Greek stuff is the best. It is cash only, which is good to know before you get there.  I had the Greek skillet, which was amazing. I'd recommend it if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for breakfast one steamy Cleveland morning.

Ordered the Corned Beef omelette - nixed the ham, but had them add some spinach.

They apparently make their own corned beef - it's not the canned stuff. Turns out there just isn't very much corned beef in their corned beef omelette - I could barely detect it. My server asked me how the omelette was - I advised her about the corned beef (or tiny amount of it). She promised that next time there would be more - since I don't live in the Cleveland area - it's questionable if I'll ever be back to experience that...

Overall, was a decent omelette - it could have used some seasoning. Coffee was kind of weak and blah.

Service was good. I'd come back again if I were in the area..."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite stops. We are Sat/Sun breakfast regulars, but popped in today for lunch. I had the best patty melt EVER -- oozing with melted cheese and loaded with tender chopped onions. The Greek family/owners a make you feel at home. As Maria said today, 'the secret is we cook with love.' Sagapo!"}
{"text":"Ok food, nothing special, nice portions, friendly service and affordable prices.  I will recommend this place, and im sure I'll be back in the future"}
{"text":"Always a great time for breakfast.  I have never been for lunch or when they used to have dinner but I am sure the same quality service, friendless and delicious food would be there."}
{"text":"Great little dinner for breakfast or lunch.  The staff is friendly and the food is reasonably priced.  We were recently there with 3 adults and 2 kids (one in a high chair), and our waitress was amazing with the kids!  She encouraged them to finish their meals and even brought a basket of prizes for them to choose from (candy and trinkets) once they were done.

*Note this restaurant is CASH ONLY, so make sure you're prepared.  Also, parking on the street in front is free on the weekends."}
{"text":"Don't let the 60s decor fool you. The breakfast food is on point and cheap as heck. The coffee was pretty good as well. Sure the place could stand for a complete renovation but the breakfast was good so I can't complain."}
{"text":"Was galavanting throughout the area while checking out apartments, and stumbled upon this gem. As someone who lived in Brook Park, I am familiar with the other The Place to Be on Smith Rd (also a former employee with nothing but amazing things to say), but had never found my way to the original location. Until now, it had almost been a mythical creature to me. Alas, my love for The Place to Be has spread to Lakewood as well. Friendly staff that cares about their customers, a menu filled with quality food, a cozy diner atmosphere, and a cup of coffee that never seemed to makes its way to empty? It doesn't get much better than that. I had asked my server about the location in Brook Park, and mentioned that my first job as a 16 year-old was there, and she informed me that she was actually the owner of the Lakewood location, and thus the sister of my prior manager. The owner of a restaurant serving tables-how cool is that?!"}
{"text":"As a former employee of this restaurant, I truly only have good things to say. The family who owns the restaurant is extremely friendly, and they take great pride in what they serve to their guests. The staff seeks to make guests feel as at-home as possible, and I truly feel as though I had developed somewhat of a second family during my time there. Super sad they are no longer open for dinner hours, they had the best homemade food in the Brook Park area (still do). Support local!"}
{"text":"My grandfather took me when i was 5years old and we kept going well until he passed away. I still go there from time to time for the memories and the good inexpensive food. The gyro platters are amazing."}
{"text":"The Place to Be is my jam. It's the default breakfast for me and my boyfriend, we're never disappointed, as we enjoy the price point and the flavor of good ol' fashioned diner food. Pretty good-sized menu/selection, and the belgium waffle is ridiculously good. The wait staff is friendly, while often a bit rushed. If you like diners, you'll like it =)"}
{"text":"We wanted to love this place, we really did. Friends and family have been recommending it for years. When we went last week we loved the cozy atmosphere and fantastic service. The problem is the food was terrible. It was clear things came straight out of the freezer. I had the veggie skillet and the veggies were clearly previously frozen. Same for my husband's meal. Even the bacon tasted off, and I've never had bacon I didn't like. I hear they're under new management, so hopefully they'll get the message and undo any changes they've made to degrade the food quality. I really do hope so, because the servers were fantastic and we love supporting local businesses. However, with all the great breakfast places in town, we won't be going back unless we hear they food has improved."}
{"text":"If I had to chose only one place for breakfast in Cleveland-- this is my pick.  

The Place to Be isn't full of surprises, there is no hollandaise or kale lurking anywhere and the hashbrowns are plain jane-- but it is reliable, fast, friendly, reasonably priced, and always serves good diner breakfast fare.  Really... that simple."}
{"text":"This place really is the place to be for breakfast. Fast attentive service and quality food at a cheap price. It doesn't get any better than this. It's your classic Greek/Lebanese style diner. At times you have to wait, but it's always worth it."}
{"text":"The breakfast use to be ok but from my taste the quality just went sour again that's my opinion, overall the service is great, and the restaraunt is clean"}
{"text":"The name says it all - this is definitely the place to be for a great breakfast! I am so happy to have stumbled upon this little diner. While it is on the small side, I have never had any trouble getting seated. The wait staff is all so friendly, and I constantly find myself engaging in genuine conversations with them whenever I visit. 
     The food is your typical diner breakfast, but you can't go wrong with that! They have egg plates, bowls, pancakes, and really anything you could ask for! Everything I've tried has always been delicious. 
     One thing to remember - they only take cash. I seem to forget this every time, but luckily always have enough on me. They do have an ATM inside, but I am not sure if it charges any fees. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for brunch since I was a child. So down to earth and delicious. Everyone is so nice. The portions are a good size too. It is cash only but they have an ATM."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 20 years. As a kid it was one of my fondest memories. Now that I have my own house in Lakewood I'm here for Sunday brunch probably 3/4 Sundays almost every month. Solid down to earth with no frills. Just delicious food at a place where you feel like family."}
{"text":"Although I've heard amazing things about their food, I never got a chance to experience it. 

Saturday morning breakfast rush I expected. We get there and there is a whole section of empty tables. Thinking we hit the breakfast rush break so time spot of the year. WRONG! 

We had 3 different people ask me how many were in our party. Not once were we told \"hold on one second or we will be right with you.\". Even had a waitress walk by and make a comment about how we were still waiting. 

15 minutes of standing there with no conversation as groups of people had started to grow behind us. At the 20 minute mark we decided the wait at bob Evans up the street would be a more beneficial wait considering they had seating."}
{"text":"I really love this little, homey, unpretentious place. Went back for another breakfast and had a gyro omelette (!) and homefries. Both were just outrageously good. Can't wait to go back again and again."}
{"text":"This place is a favorite for my family and I when we come visit Ohio. Family-owned, fast service, large portions and great customer service. They conveniently have an ATM, so people who forget to bring cash can still pull some. 

Their breakfasts are great! Haven't tried their lunch menu aside from the grilled cheese special they had... So good! We will be back again and will be happy to see the family who owns this place again."}
{"text":"Hidden gem for good breakfast, friendly staff good food and reasonable priced. Will always come here for breakfast now. Think local!"}
{"text":"Went here when my go-to breakfast place was closed. 

It's a great mom and pop diner. There is lot parking right behind it or you can drive North on Warren a bit and park along the street. 

You get a great amount of food for the price. The food came out within 5 minutes of ordering. The diner wasn't too busy, but it had enough people that I expected it to be a longer wait. The omelet I had was the perfect amount of peppers, onions, ham, and cheese. Got a lot of hash browns with it, too. My buddy ordered the cinnamon french toast. It was nice and thick bread, and it had the perfect amount of cinnamon. The waitress was around constantly filling up our coffee. 

Definitely gonna come back here."}
{"text":"Always good food. When it comes to breakfast food, you can't go wrong. The menu is gigantic. They also have a giant lunch menu, but why bother when you can eat breakfast at any time of day. Amazing omelette, great skillets, even the wheat toast is delicious and smothered with butter. Ultimate comfort food. 

Service is alright, hit or miss, not always the friendliest. They are fast though for the most part, even when it's crowded, which it usually is on a weekend morning. It's cash only, so remember that. And you pay at the register, not at the table."}
{"text":"Small diner with big portions. Great food and super fast serving time. Friendly workers and family owned for generations. 

Simply the best and a Lakewood tradition."}
{"text":"This is yet another classic diner in Cleveland. You get a real feel for the genuine people of the city at this spot. The gyro is great and it is usually my go to. It is very filling and almost too much to eat at once. Breakfast is good there also. A hidden gem and a good choice if the wait at Melt is the typical 4 hours to be seated. Matter of fact, bypass Melt and just go to The Place To Be! Melt is the place not to be! Unless you want to tell everyone how cool you are because you ate at Melt."}
{"text":"I really like TPTB. I've only tried the breakfast there, but it's always been tasty. Last time I was there I had the Greek Skillet, gyro meat was well seasoned and tender. Fair prices and a nice family run atmosphere. Service had always been on point for me.

Only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that they don't take cc...It's 2015 people"}
{"text":"More like, the place NOT to be. They put the term, \"basic breakfast\" to true definition when I ordered the southwest skillet. Once I saw the abomination coming towards me I immediately knew this was going to be a terrible meal. With 0 seasoning and all the condiments (jalapeños, tomatoes, olives and more) looking like they were shook out of can moments before, I couldn't believe someone cooked and served that with pride. Wait staff was a tad offended I couldn't stomach their meal, which was also baffling at that. A friend of mine also ordered the Benedict and was also a monstrosity of a meal. I never send meals back, so for me this was truly a wild moment in food history. Truth be told, there's much better places to eat in Lakewood/Cleveland. Don't waste your experience/money here."}
{"text":"I come to this place at least once a week for breakfast. The good is pretty good. The prices are fair. I usually get the Belgian waffle and a cup of coffee (good coffee). The staff is friendly for the most part. My only real qualm with the place are that I can't pay with my credit card."}
{"text":"Great service I mean this lady goes above and beyond doing her job ! I think it's why I keep coming back plus food is so good ! Haha yummy breakfast !! Thanks guys!!"}
