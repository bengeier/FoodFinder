{"text":"Possibly the best Mexican food in Phoenix.  Priced right too!  I had a party catered from there and had more than enough food and had great reviews."}
{"text":"Great inexpensive stop for Mexican food lunch.  Exceeds quality of any of the other \"quick\" Mexican food places."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious. My favorite 'to go'/dive Mexican place in Phoenix. The salsa is just the right amount of spicy. Never been disappointed. 
FYI, they are cash only and no longer open on Sundays."}
{"text":"The place is pretty cool I've wanted to check this place out for 10 years there red chili sucks I wouldn't walk across the street if they let me it for free for life! There green ain't bad but there chilis more like gravy I like there chimi special on Monday the service is good there menus pretty  big I'll come back it has a vibe I like and I'm sure there's other stuff on the menu that's good seen a few thing I'd like to try not to many Mexican spots impress me nothing like my g maws cooking when it comes to chili."}
{"text":"Thursday's Special of the Day: Chili Relleno with beans, rice and a soda...cost me $5.25 AND it was delicious! It was a big portion and it also came with a warm tortilla on the side. My only complaint ; there were a few stray pieces of meat in the sauce that covered the chili and I am vegetarian, no biggy really,  just picked them out and moved on. The inside area where you order is kinda tiny, but they have an outside window where you can wait until your order is up. We stayed and sat on the patio to eat which was cozy and surprisingly quiet considering it is right off of a main street. I will definitely keep this in my list of places for a yummy fast lunch while at work. Keep in mind though, CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"If your looking for real authentic mexican food than you have came to the right place.  Its in the hood but the neighborhood is up n coming.  Be prepared to wait if your going during your lunch break but it is well worth it.  My favorite item on their menu is the Salsa (to-die for)!  I love their tacos and their burritos.  Family owned and gives you that neighborhood feel to it bottom line its real mexican food! #cookiemonsterfiles"}
{"text":"Food was just ok. We visited after a baseball game after finding 4 star reviews on Yelp. My family and I ordered tacos, flautas (might be better recognized as taquitos), bean burritos, tostadas, and enchiladas. The tacos were ok. Flautas ok. Bean Burrito ok. Tortillas not too fresh. Enchiladas we're the worst of them all as they were just simply not good. They were very spicy (which is ok) but not tasty. The tacos and tostadas were topped with iceberg lettuce and shredded American cheese. Not very authentic at all. The shop staff were very nice. They do not accept credit/debit at all. I had to walk across the street to convenience store to get cash back. Overall, probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is the best Mexican food I've had in the valley.  The chimichanga is big, beautiful, and delicious!  The taco salad is one of the best that I've ever had.  If you're looking for a great, cheap lunch option, their daily $5.45 special, which includes a drink, is hands down the best deal in town.  

Restaurant is best for take-out since they have limited seating and it's not in the greatest area.  Cash-only.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love me some tacos at El Norteno!  Shredded beef all the way...wife likes 'em with the machaca.  Pour some salsa on after each bite and I'm in heaven.

Thank goodness they only take cash (for my sake), otherwise I would have been eating there way more often than I already do.

Definitely a whole in the wall, but the cashier is always friendly and helpful.  Food is always fresh and it's only occasionally you'll have to deal with a tweaker or two walking over from the Circle K across the street.  

My favorite place to get tacos in the valley."}
{"text":"A-OK, yum yum
This place is clean.
At first, I was like \"never eating at that place, WHO would eat there?\" Then I tried it, and I am no longer missing out on this great Mexican food joint, delicioso! 
Tip--only accepts cash!!!"}
{"text":"Went today for the first time after seeing lines everyday and reading the reviews and oh my gosh, simply amazing! As many have said the ladies at the counter are nothing but sweet and helpful. Got the red chili after reading the reviews and it is incredible. Close to work, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"When we moved to Garfield 10 years ago this place was our splurge mexican food.  Yes, we were that ghetto -- barrio would be more appropos.  #11 no queso or sonoronan enchilladas.  Great peppery salsa.  Good tamales made with manteca.  One lunch effort was thwarted as la policia filled the parking lot.  Servers are sweet and funny and quick.  I suspect I've had food poisoning twice from here but their number is still programmed into my cell."}
{"text":"Love the Mexican Pizza fantastic all the little whole in the wall places are very good. Friendly and fast service"}
{"text":"It sucks not being able to find a menu online to order ahead...I can add that Tuesday lunch special is taco salad. 

The two enchilada combo was delicious and piping hot. I will definitely be going there again...it's surprisingly hard to find good greasy mexican food. I would plan on just getting takeout...unless you want to sit in an outdoor cage."}
{"text":"Relatively inexpensive, good solid mexican food place. I wouldn't drive 5 miles for it, but its a lifesaver if you live nearby. Better than the 'bertos."}
{"text":"Good, Cheap, FRIENDLY, and QUICK!!!
I'm already addicted to their \"green chile burros\".  Very basic, green chili pork, beans, wrapped in a tortilla... but full of flavor.  I usually don't like beans but I like em here. I had their chilaquilas too... just ok.. a little sloppy.. but it;s a total dive so I'll take it.    

Best as a take out joint."}
{"text":"Everything here is good. The steak piccata, the machaca, the red chile, you name it - it's all good and very reasonably priced! Friendly staff and quick service as well. The dining area is small and outdoors but that's the only downfall here. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had the Arizona burrito for breakfast -- it was definitely large.  I don't know if I'd say it is the \"Best Food in Town\" as the menu says, but it satisfied my hunger.  I would try it again if I'm in that part of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Been to El Norteno a few times and it's a good, small, and authentic Mexican food spot. There's always people outside and they always seem busy, so that means it must be good. The chips and sauce are the best! They have a pretty good chorizo breakfast burrito too. It's cash only and there's not much for seating, but great to get when you wanna get some Mexican food to go."}
{"text":"Great vibe, big portions for a low price. Their red sauce is amazing but the inside of the food was ice cold and the chicken isn't anything special. The beans were hot and well seasoned and the rice was well cooked. I would most certainly go back to try a different dish."}
{"text":"I really love this place been going here for 20 years. I love their food only gripe is over the Potatoes they put in the ground Beef. Besides that every thing else is Great."}
{"text":"This spot was close to where I was staying and this was no where near a 4 star, no chips with your food, the rice sucks the beans are ehhh, the asada was really really dry at 7pm on a Thursday with a big line, the food either needed salt or was overly drenched in bland guac or salsa. Living in L.A. I guess spoiled me with real Mexican food. And hey my gf and I are both crop dusting and making friends with the toilet"}
{"text":"El Norteno is my shit!!! I was in the Navy and everytime Id come home on leave my best friend would take me here.. Needless to say I live close enough now to where I can make a pretty convenient stop whenever I get the cravings.. Cash only.. I always go with the Green Chilli Burro enchilada style with Red sauce, rice and beans.. the meat is so tender and shredds apart in your mouth.. you will not be disappointed.. Ive been eating Ritos since I was a kid and this place definitely rivals them.. but with their shitty hrs and horrible conditions this spot is a no brainer!! Im going right now"}
{"text":"Plenty of food for the price and it's always good.  Yeah, it lacks ambiance when you stay and eat outside and you never know who's going to wander by, but that's part of the charm."}
{"text":"My gpa likes this place and orders the Chile Relleno burrito...I wish I did too....but I ordered Chile Verde and it was disgusting. Hardly any meat a bunch of goo and one very thin tortilla that was very very soggy."}
{"text":"Very good food, bring it in for my crew all the time and everyone loves it! Wish they took cash but that a minor detail. Menudo on the weekends is very tasty! Stop in and have a taste you won't regret it"}
{"text":"If you want cheesy, fried deliciousness this is the place! Although the food is heavy, you can tell it's fresh from the salsa to the pulled chicken. Some of my favorites are the chicken fundido and tamales with red sauce!  CASH ONLY FYI"}
{"text":"This place pushes out some delicious food, Red chile burro with rice and beans is better than any I've had, and their Nachos are soooo freaking cheesey and good you'll want to order both for one sitting. Unfortunately only outside seating but cool art work on the building to enjoy while eating and don't be discouraged by there greedy practice of charging for extra hot sauce. But of all things to remember make sure you bring cash the place can't afford a card processing machine which is a good thing other wise I'd be there too often and a fat face looks weird on me"}
{"text":"Dammit El Norteno, why must your enchiladas be so amazing?!  

Do not let the exterior fool you, hidden inside the unassuming fa√ßade is a genie that grants all your Mexican food wishes.  

This place is literally the size of a postage stamp.  It has a walk-in area to place orders at that becomes crowded once the line reaches 3 people, and an outside walk-up window.  There are a couple of plastic tables and chairs by the window, and a partially enclosed patio area with some more tables and seating.  

There is no inside seating.  I know this is important to some people, but I get most of my food to go so this is not an issue for me.

This is a cash only establishment.  It's worth the trip to the ATM, trust me. 

There is no drive thru.  I wasn't kidding when I said this place is small.

They have some of the BEST enchiladas I have ever had; seriously, in the top 2.  I don't know what is so magical about that red sauce, but I would bottle it and sell it.   

You will NEVER leave this place hungry.  I recently stood in line behind 2 hipsters on bikes and listened to them order an alarming amount of food, then look wildly perplexed about how they would get this much food home on their bikes....amateurs.

They have specials for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Taco Wednesday is sheer shenanigans, but worth the reward if you persevere; 2 shredded beef tacos, rice and beans for $4.99.  

See ya next wendnesday El Norteno!  :)"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food in Phoenix!!! Do not let the area or appearance scare you away!!!"}
{"text":"No better place than this authentic hole in the wall. I like the enchiladas so much that I haven't tried anything else. Authenticity is the word here. Rice and beans are, should I say, marvelous! Prices are right too. Like patio with the funky diner seating. Could use a rest room for those of us who like to sit in. Norte√±o is really about take out though. That keeps them busy. Hey people know!"}
{"text":"Check the health department inspections. You may not be so quick to go there. Food was great but if I catch salmonella it is hardly worth it. Place reminds me of an outdoor cafe in Mexico. Even had the traditional loose dog in the dining area last time."}
{"text":"Ok so this is the perfect time of the year to enjoy the outdoor patio seating.  This is my favorite Mexican food in town. It is authentic and every item on the menu is exceptional.   This is the place you would drive by but if you stop you will find some of the best Mexican food in town. Their chorizo is homemade. I'm a big fan of the enchiladas and the green chili burros are awesome.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Well, they would have received 5 stars, however, the service the 2nd time around was horrible!

Food: Very inexpensive with 2 burritos costing less than 8 dollars. Hot Sauce is amazingly good to the point that we finished the entire bottle they gave us for sit-in. Takeout orders get 2 extremely small containers per burrito which is not nearly enough. Important to note that there is no salsa bar.

Location: Close to the airport (less than 5 miles) and very small. Place your order inside then wait for it outside. A small eating area is available attached to the kitchen. Nothing fancy or special, but heck, its cheap.

Service: The first time around we received our orders as requested. The second time, my GF who is vegetarian received a burrito with meat inside despite clearly indicating 'no meat'. This was during closing time and they were surprised when she came back to demand a new burrito saying 'you didnt eat that outside cause its closed?'. Clearly they were more concerning about closing up than just having given a customer a wrong order. Then on the way to the car rental, the replacement burrito was also discovered to have meat inside. It was immediately thrown into the garbage by my disappointed GF. Completely unacceptable and a 3 star demerit.

While the food was good, we probably would not come here again due to not wanting food to go to waste (when we receive items with meat inside when requested without) and lack of hot sauce / salsa when doing take out."}
{"text":"Can I give two separate ratings?  The two is an average of my two stops, for which I'd give it a 5 and a 0.  Obviously the 5 visit came first or I wouldn't have been back.

The first trip was great!  My plane landed and I yelped for taqueria's (after 3 months in NJ following a year in SoCal I was dying for good mexican) this place was close to the airport with good reviews so I figured I'd give it a try.  Fantastic, simple, cheap and delicious.  The hot sauce was great, so tasty.  

This was therefore our logical dinner stop on our way back to the airport after a week and a half traveling around arizona and utah.  

I tried to order the \"grande burro\" with beans instead of the meat.  I am a vegetarian, but I wanted the lettuce, tomato, and guacamole instead of just beans and cheese.  After 5 minutes of discussion, trying to explain this (the girl at the counter spoke perfect english, I don't know why no meat was so confusing) she convinced me to just get a bean and cheese burrito.  Fine whatever, so I got a bean and cheese burrito.  Or so I thought.  I cut into it (sitting in my car in the parking lot b/c they had closed the seating area for the night) and found a chunk of meat.

So I brought it back, and told her that I didn't want meat.  She was incredibly nice and very apologetic and had the cook re-make it \"without\" meat.  At this point I'm looking at my watch wondering if we're making our plane.  My boyfriend finished his food before I got back to the car.  So I come back with a new burrito (and no new salsa since I'd dumped the salsa they'd given me onto the first burrito before seeing the meat :( ), dig into it and not seeing any meat, we drive off.  Munching along while driving, I came across the meat.  The rest of my burrito went into the trash at the car rental return place and I went home hungry and disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and great staff. I am never disappointed when I come here for lunch. The red Chile burrito is my favorite!"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome. The best hole in the wall in Phoenix. It's been there forever and the same staff. The only down fall is it only accepts cash. But there is a ATM across the street at the Circle K. Very clean establishment and maintained. The wait time is average of about 10 min during lunch time. I recommend this place and don't forget the salsa..."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time the other night. Had the Pollo Fundido. It was out of this world. Chicken was particularly good, as were the tortillas."}
{"text":"Warning!  If you're from out of town, you're going to regret coming here because you can't come back every single day.  I know 'cause It happened to me.  The home made chorizo was perfectly spiced.  The burritos were humongous!  Even the semi home made horchata was outstanding!  El Norte√±o?  Marry me and come home with me to Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has tasted of sadness.  The tortillas were stale, the beans were flavorless, and the eggs were no good.  This place might cut it in another city, but with the abundance of cheap, delicious mexican food in phoenix, take a pass on norteno's."}
{"text":"Naaaaw most people judge this place by the outside but its been in this neighborhood since 1981 & the food is phenomenal & it's very clean on the inside! EVERTHING on the menu is mouth watering good! The prices are better than most places & the portion are you can't finish it all belly filling. No one who has ever eaten here has walked away dissatisfied. I tell everyone I can about this small local business. I had some last night!"}
{"text":"I am addicted to El Norteno. There hasn't been a bad meal here. EVERYTHING I've tried is delicious. Great prices and great service. I would give this place more than 5 stars. If you are in the neighborhood, this place is a must."}
{"text":"Delicious dive. Beans were spot on. Tacos tasty and full of flavour. Highly recommend. They also have about 8 tables along the side that are covered from the elements. Cash only. Love this concept. :-)"}
{"text":"Love this place! I go here at least once a month. The food is amazing and the prices are great! I recently got the burro grande with a horchata instead of a soft drink for $6! They have a small chips and salsa which is more like a large for only $2 bucks! So for $8 I got something for myself that my husband actually had to help me finish because it was so much food!
Watch their daily specials that they have for breakfast, lunch and dinner. You can never go wrong with any of them! Especially the prices they have for the specials I mean lunch for under 5 bucks!
One thing to know they only take CASH so don't forget it!"}
{"text":"The beans and rice here are like crack. So addicting, so amazing. I'm actually pretty curious what they put it in, but it's probably best not to know.

I always get the same thing, a burro with beans, rice and potatoes. It's not on the menu, but it's always really tasty and lasts for two meals.

I've also tried the cheese enchiladas, which are really good as well, but a little rich and oily for my taste.

This is always on my must-eat list whenever I'm in AZ!"}
{"text":"Great taco and burrito joint that's always busy.  They make the same things as other places only they make them better.  I always go for the breakfast burritos but lunch and dinner are also great."}
{"text":"Was really disappointed.

After reading positive reviews and looking at the menu I was so excited to try this place out. Placed a take out order (Which was quick) and couldn't wait to get home to try the food.

I ordered the Arizona burro, Machaca cheese crisp, green chile tamale, red chile gordita and had a staff member pick a taco for me.

I'm sorry to say the cheese crisp and maybe the gordita were the only things with any flavor. Everything else, bland. 

I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this spot.  It's totally economical (i.e. cheap), it's cash only and it's super quaint to say the least.

But warning, don't come here expecting anything other than a supercharged 'Bertos experience.  And when I say this, I'm making the clear distinction that the food here is awesome.  The enchilada sauce, the red chile and the green chile are super on point.  The beans are pretty good, not on that Carolina's level but close.  Tacos are head and shoulders above tons of other places.  

There is no place to sit.  The only seating area is a little shack type area with old school booths, gated style good walls and an a/c that serves it's purpose but this is Phoenix and it's flippin hot.  There's about 8 booths in there.  

My go-to is the 3-Way burro which is red chile, green chile and beans.  It's the best.  They have a 2-Way which is just red and green plus they have the line up of usual suspects that are all done nicely.  Grande Burro is on my list of future orders.

For this type of fast food, Sonoran style Mexican restaurant, I do feel El Norteno is doing it right.  Go there."}
{"text":"Love their gorditas! Best I've ever had. Only negative is their not-very-clean outdoor seating area. Carry out is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best little Mexican secret in town!  It's been in the same little unassuming, shack for decades!  They serve up delicious, quality, authentic Mexican fare!  Their machaca has to be one of the best in town!  It's definitely a pick up to take home type place since the only dining area they have is an outdoor covered area.  Just call ahead and go get it!"}
{"text":"The service here is horrible. They messed up my order and I asked to fix it and they did not want to fix it. They said it that's not what I ordered and wanted to charge me for another plate. When I refused to pay for another plate they said there is other places in the area I can eat at. They started talking about me in Spanish not knowing I knew Spanish. Very unprofessional. My friend got the tacos and they were not that great and didn't have a lot of meat!"}
{"text":"Can't get a better deal anywhere for the grande burrito and drink for 5.50. Normally places give a small amount of sour cream and guac but this place over does it... I can't complain, really tasty."}
{"text":"I showed up at 9:50 pm ready to get some delicious Mexican food. The light was off and the door was locked. The two females inside signaled me that it was closed. I thought maybe the hours were wrong on Yelp. No, the sign was there clear as day Monday through Saturday they are opened till 10. Don't post hours if you aren't going to abide by them."}
{"text":"El Norte√±o is a small Mexican food join on the NW corner of 7th and Roosevelt.  Most of us have driven by it many times without giving it a second thought.  It looks kind of sketchy from the outside.  After reading many reviews I bookmarked it to give it a chance sometime.  It isn't very close to me and if I am driving to this side of town it is usually for a safe bet.  I finally was in the area and a friend recommended we go there for a quick bite.  The setting is order at the window and take to go or sit in their patio.

I ordered some nachos and my son got a carne asada quesadilla.  The food was made fresh and the price was the same as any fast food Mexican joint in the valley.  The nachos were on par with any \"bertos\" as was the quesadilla.  The salsa was also decent but again on par with every other fast food place around.

For all the 5 star reviews I had much higher expectations.  It was good but not great.  I do not think I would go out of my way to come back or highly recommend to others."}
{"text":"Is there a better way to say EXCELLENT food...
NO THERE ISNT.... I think I've tasted everything on the menu. 

Simply delicious.

They are consistent. Food is always delicious. They take your order over the phone without excuses. After having NORTENO ALL the other Mexican restaurants don't even matter anymore. It's like driving past a bunch of grave yards and you see the light at the end of the road ,,, and what is that light

NORTENO .......

S.Z.J"}
{"text":"Don't let the look of the place fool you. The food here is awesome!!!!! Bring cash because it's all they accept. The Chile Releno, and Mexican Pizza are my two favorite things. This place is perfect for someone looking to experience a true hole in the wall no frills place where they will get great food with a smile. You can order from inside the small cashier area or just walk up to the window on the side. Dining area is outdoors with a screen door, but once again don't let this bother you. The food is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Great food,  beware the Mexican Pizza is not an appetizer, it is a 12 inch pizza size.! Cash only and out door dine in."}
{"text":"This was my old neighborhood.  My friend talked me into trying their burritos.  I first tried their red chili. It was salty and the sauce too thick. . I did like their skin . Their was plenty of sauce and meat. Also tried their green burritos . It had too much cumin and again the sauce was too thick. Meat was a little dry . I did like their macaco and egg . Their chips were nice and fresh"}
{"text":"Food can definitely do with out the grease and lard Taste to it . Ate here and u can taste the lard or whatever it is they use to make their food . It leaves an after taste in your mouth with that greasy film in your mouth . I'm giving them 2 stars just for the girl taking your order cuz she was nice but I'd like to leave no stars for the owner for not replacing my order which was made not the way asked ."}
{"text":"***CASH ONLY***

Great quality food at reasonable prices.  This evening I ordered three #14 combo's (machaca chimichangas with beans and rice), a bean burrito with a side of rice and a carne asada cheese crisp.  My total was less than $40!  

This place is a more of a take out establishment.  They do offer a small outdoor seating area if you like to sweat your arse off while dining.  When I arrived home the family was very pleased with their orders."}
{"text":"I just visited this place and ordered two burritos of green chili. When I got home I found out they had passed me red chili burrowed. It is not worth traveling all the way back to this place to engage people who apparently can't understand English or are trying to push a different product. The red burros are recursively spicy. Check your order at the window. This is something I intend to pursue with the Better Business bureau tomorrow. I am not happy. I paid for green chili burros; I did not ask them for any favors."}
{"text":"REAL mexican food. The BEST red sauce you will find out there. Drive over 50 miles to this place at least once a month just for a red burrito. Call ahead to pick up though as this place gets jam packed busy."}
{"text":"El Norte√±o is a family tradition, at least in my family. My parents started eating here in 80s and passed down the obsession to me and my siblings. Very delicious! 
I always order one of two things. Green Burro Grande or Machaca plate. Chips & Salsa always. I take the pint of salsa home and keep it in the fridge for eggs, chicken and whatever else would taste good with salsa. 

If you're not uptight or whatever then you'll love this place. Don't judge a book by its cover! Don't forget that you're in Phoenix and embrace the delicious Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Phoenix to visit my boyfriend we end up coming here for a late night tipsy burrito run. Service is slow but the food is pretty good. The Mexican Pizza is delicious and really hit the spot the other night after bland airport food. Their burritos are also pretty legit."}
{"text":"best machaca ever! what they lack in location and ambience is made up with their amazing food. get the machaca enchilada style, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Sadly I was not veey impressed with this place. I don't know if the long wait and stomachache is worth the cheap food. Tasty food it is. But I am been to Mexico all different parts and this doesnt taste authentic. So why do people wait in a long line and crowd at this place? Perhaps they see a lond and think its good? Idk *Not a super safe vibe either."}
{"text":"El Norteno was a NICE surprise for me. A neighbor recommended it several times, it had marginal street appeal so I had never bothered to stop in. Their Enchilada Platter won me over and I've been back several times.

Make no mistake, this place looks like a dive...and it is. TASTY Mexican food though, with quick service, reasonable prices, in a convenient location. Their Breakfast Burrito is HUGE, delicious and a bargain at $3.75. Their rice and beans won't disappoint either.

Breakfast, lunch, dinner, or late nite snack, El Norteno gets the job done."}
{"text":"If you don't mind great, dive, been-around-over-30-years, amazing food, then this is your place. If you don't mind walking up to the window and either taking your treasure home or sitting on their silly patio, then this is your place. One of the things I grew to hate was that I moved into an apartment down the street and signed a year lease, before I actually knew what I was getting into. One must find balance in one's life, but that was very hard for me to do, once I'd had their red chili, pollo fundido and carne asada (Which has never been my favorite. It is, now.) plates. I'd only had pollo fundido at one other place, which will remain nameless because I still love it...but it was consistently burnt. Not so at El Norteno. I will guestimate that I ordered food there at LEAST 50 times whilde I had my little place. My orders were never easy, always high-maintenance. In the entire time of our relationship, they got something wrong on my order exactly twice. That is an impeccable record, trust me. 

Besides having absolutely wonderful food, the staff was always friendly and often remembered the changes in my order. I was gone this whole summer and of all the restaurants I love, this one was the one I craved. El Norteno, I will take full responsibility for the extra 25 pounds I carry around now, but damnit, it was because I couldn't stay away!"}
{"text":"Awesome Carne Asada Burritos.

Not much else to say.

Bring Cash"}
{"text":"Delicious, Mexican food at great prices! We've ordered a variety of food and have many favorite go-to meals, some of them are the carne asada cheese crisp, the green chile burrito-enchilada style, the chicken chimichangas and the chips and salsa. The breakfast burritos are also muy delicioso! El Nortenos can get pretty busy; we always call in our order to minimize our wait time. This place is cash only, which probably helps them keep their prices low."}
{"text":"Cash only so stop at the ATM before you come. Great Mexican food at great prices. You go inside, place your order then stand outside or in the covered dining area till they call your number. Very mixed clientele here. Today I see construction workers, beautiful young latinas, old white guys, a couple hipsters and some business professional types in suits. Chili is good....not too hot but not too mild. Great place to eat at a reasonable cost!"}
{"text":"I've been living in AZ for about one year now and I am totally crazy about this place! I love the ladies that work there and I looooove the food..."}
{"text":"The poster child for hole in the wall Mexican food. Amazing food for amazing prices. The breakfast burritos are the highlight of the menu. Their hot sauce they provide is lights out. Not too spicy but just enough kick. 

If you're looking for a step up from the Filibertos of the world, this is your place."}
{"text":"Holy crap! This is hands-down the best dive I've ever visited for Mexican food. You will not find a better place. When you pull up, you'll be skeptical...trust me. Try it. 

The restaurant is cash only and the dining area is outside, screened porch. Again, put that aside. You're not here because of any of that.

You are here because of the food. The food. The fresh made tortillas. The hand pulled chicken, the perfectly seasoned steak. The rice and beans that are lovingly made fresh daily. 

My son had the red chili burrito and has said on more than one occasion that it changed his life. He gets a far-away look on his face whenever he talks about it. 

The place is PACKED during the week with business people and on weekends--even more packed with locals. They know something you don't know yet...but you will...Norteno is the bomb. Go. Now. Seriously."}
{"text":"First off, I haven't done any reviews in quite some time, so forgive me for being a slacker.  But I went to El Norteno today after a long time (about 2 years) and was thrilled to see it still cranking out the best red chile I've tasted anywhere.  Yes, Matt K, I read your review and you panned it pretty good.  Tortillas not as good as Taco Bell.  Ok Matt, you could NOT have tried the red chile burrito.  This assertively spiced, hearty concoction absolutely tantalizes the taste buds.  It is a bit hot but not painfully so... but the flavor washes over you like waves on the Huatulco beaches.  Grab a side of creamy, smooth refried beans and some of their red salsa (redolent with the smoky flavor of Mexican cumin) and you will be hooked.  As far as the \"atmosphere\" goes, I'm not a big fan of the outdoor dining this time of year (August) so I get it to go.  But I've eaten there in November and it's fine.  

Mexican food lovers, Carolina's lovers, TRY THIS PLACE.  You like hole in the wall Mexican, this roadside gem delivers big flavors at little prices.  Matt K can have his Taco Bell.  I'll take El Norteno."}
{"text":"When we pulled up I almost made my husband turn around & take me somewhere else...it looked crazy sketchy.  We went & ordered at the window & sat outside (only seating there is) our food came out very quickly. I ordered a chicken chimichanga with green sauce, it was full of onions & the green sauce was just salsa, I was expecting some kind of chile sauce.  As I got to the middle of the chimi, it was very cold on the inside, as in, not cooked. Weird. The beans & rice were SO good, though! My husband wants to come back & try something else, I'm not too sure yet how I feel about it."}
{"text":"I love this little spot! The staff is always friendly and everything I've had here is so good, my absolute favorite is the Green Chile  with a tortilla on the side. The prices are great just have cash available as they do not accept any other payment option."}
{"text":"The best Tacos I have ever had coming from a restaurant.  They are always hot, stuffed with meat ( they don't skimp) and fresh.  The salsa is close to my Aunt Bernice's!  If I didn't know better, I'd swear my Nana was cooking.  The ladies at the cash register are very friendly.  Grab some chips and salsa and a couple of tacos.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The $3.99 lunch specials are amazing. A ton of food and even includes a drink. The salsa is unique (peppery/salty/slightly spicy) and the shredded beef in their tacos (Wednesdays lunch special is 2 tacos, beans & rice) has amazing flavor. One of the very best mexican dives in town"}
{"text":"Ate here for the 1st time today based on a co-workers recommendation. The menu choices looked great so I will have to come back just to try more things. I ordered the chilaquiles with over easy eggs. For some reason you have the option for scrambled. They were good. Eggs on top of tortilla chips with cheese and enchilada sauce. Good amount of spice. Bottom line, good lunch place. Decent prices, good for take out, you can eat in a caged in area outside if you want, which was perfectly fine. I recommend & will go back."}
{"text":"Omg best little joint in downtown Phx area. No frills place. It's a joint that locals love.
Seating is limited and outside, thus the 4 stars ...the green enchiladas are the best!
Highly recommend. Wish they sold Mexican beer!"}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall place but the food is delicious. If your looking for a place to have lunch at a cheap price this is a good call.. I have tried the red and green enchiladas and the tamale all were very good. Rice and beans also very tasty."}
{"text":"What a great surprise!  I have driven by this restaurant for the past 13 years and was honestly put off by outward appearances, but was given a recommendation by a friend and decided to try it out.  I am so glad I finally gave it a shot as the food was seriously good.  I tried the cheese enchiladas with rice and beans and loved the enchilada sauce...just enough spice to really enjoy it.  This place will definitely be added to the rotation since it is convenient to our downtown neighborhood and the food is solid and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I should go less as it wasn't just me, but it was awesome up until recently. It's been the last couple of times that I felt poorly after eating here. 

The first was a couple of months ago when my office sent me out for take out. I was not the only one feeling it then. Last Friday was the last straw though, though. It's a fair weather favorite as it's not air conditioned and we went again. My boss was sweating after the meal and I felt a chili eaters superiority - until a few hours later when I felt my gut burning. And I like it hot!  He said he didn't feel good then either. Up until now I'd never made a bad lunch selection for him. That record is hosed. 

The other person with us had intended to take part of the generous portion home, but trashed the rest after all."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall, authentic Mexican. Awesome customer service. Parking and seating is a bit limited, but what do you expect? :)"}
{"text":"Great red chile burros, tasty beans and super cheap."}
{"text":"What they lack in seating and credit card acceptance they make up for in flavors and textures.

Thursdays are Chile rellno special days, for $5.45 you get a chillie rellno, beans, rice, tortilla  and a small drink. A real steal but the value goes way up when you try the food as the flavors are great, rich thick red sauce, a firm texture to the rellno and rice that goes very well with their hot sauce.

Note in summer it may not be great as there is ONLY outdoor seating and waiting, and they are Cash only."}
{"text":"When they say CASH ONLY, you know it's gonna be Amazing! My favorite is the Pollo fundido! Wait time is usually longer when I order this buts worth the wait! It packs a punch too!"}
{"text":"Food was ok but the price and service made up for it. Also nowhere to really sit and it's cash only."}
{"text":"The food here is good. I have tried many things in their menu. Pricing is excellent for the serving you get. You can also order in advance by phone and pick it up which is very convenient to avoid lunch traffic."}
{"text":"Yes, El Norteno is a \"hole in the wall\".  In my experience, any really good mexican food I have had comes from a hole in the wall.  Think about it!  Anyway, I order the lunch special (take out) almost every Thursday - the chile relleno plate.  It is awesome and highly recommended.  Call ahead and place your order today, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best red chile burritos ever!  Take an extra $5 to buy something for one of the homeless guys that hang out here."}
{"text":"We were in Pheonix for the weekend and wanted to try some Mexican food. We were a little skeptical since we are from Southern California. But this place was AMAZING! Place is CASH ONLY, so we didn't come that prepared and got carne asada nachos that left us wanting more. We'll be back next time we're in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican food I've found in the 8 years of living here. I try to get something different every time I go and I have yet to be disappointed. The hot sauce is great too."}
{"text":"This place is Mexican Crack!! This is my 2nd visit and so far everything I've got to from the delicious enchiladas to the crunchy generously stuffed shredded beef tacos! Chips and Salsa are a plus. Completely delicious. The portions are big and the price is right. Definitely my new hot spot.  Would've taken some pictures for today's show & tell but I already devoured it!"}
{"text":"This may seem ridiculous, and it is that I've driven past El norteno for the last few years on my daily commute, however I just stopped there the other day for the first time. The reason is because the parking lot is always so full I don't bother stop. That tells me they're doing something right. And they definitely are. I got out of work early on a Saturday and felt like royalty being served this huge red Chile pork burrito with authentic Mexican rice and refried beans. It was worth the wait but now I know I have to go back. Great service, great prices, great selection of authentic flavorful food. Yum!! Loving this place."}
{"text":"Why do I have to love El Norteno so much? Why?  Why can't I find their red chile to be  anything but perfection...spicy red sauce so good I would eat it without meat, hot or cold, with our without a tortilla, with or without a utensil if need be.  If I left a burrito in my car in July and found it a week later, I would likely still eat it, and just suffer the consequences later.  The green chile is a close second, though.  Best to get both.  And a Mexican coke...they carry the big 16 oz bottles.

I did try the machaca, and while it was pretty good, I still wished it were actually dried meat.  But they do put the meat on the grill after cooking to dry it out a bit, so it's closer to the way I like it.  They make a great shredded beef taco, too.  Meat that's not overly seasoned and a freshly fried taco shell.  I guess you could get a soft taco, but really, what's the point?  I also got a plate last time, just to try the beans and rice.  Beans were good, but I could do without.  I do like that they don't put peas & carrots in their rice.  What is the point of that anyway?  It's not like you need to stretch rice because it is so expensive.  And is eating a tablespoon of vegetables going to undo the fact that I just consumed 9,000 calories?

But my biggest question is why does it have to be so damn far away?  Oh, I know.  Because if it was in Scottsdale, they would have to charge $11.99 for a burrito, and it would suck anyway.  I now find myself making a lot more donations to the Humane Society thrift store in Sunnyslope...just a quick drive down 7th Avenue on my way home.  Sort of."}
{"text":"My favorite taco shop in town. Best salsa, best beans, and the green enchilada is amazing. It's cash only though so come prepared."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Mexican food! You can smell it from down the street. I'm here in phoenix on vacation from minnesota and this place really completed our trip. I got the cheese enchiladas (spicy!) and my boyfriend got some steak tacos. Also super affordable. The service was quick and friendly. The girl up front let us put in our order even though we had no cash with us (cash only) and by the time we got back from the atm our meals were ready. The building itself is super cute too! Definitely check this place out"}
{"text":"Eaten here a few times, and while it's not much to look at, the food is pretty darn tasty, flavorful and a little spicy. If you're looking to burn your mouth (and ass) this probably isn't your place. The beans and rice are consistently yummy, I've tried the red and green chile meat, tacos, tamales with red and beef, and the pollo fundido, and never been disappointed. They also have coke in the bottle, yay! 
They cool the outdoor seating area, which is shaded, and it helps, but if you're  a wuss, get it to go. 
I'd up it to 5 stars if they didn't take only cash. Who carries cash anymore?"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in all of AZ. Literally around the corner from my dad's house have been going there since I was younger. I've never had any issues with the food and it always comes out right. Thank you! Love your food"}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican food restaurants I ever have been to All my friends and family have gone here since early 80's, I live in Los Angeles now and miss the true real deal that El Norteno has. I have three place I consider the \"best\" and this one of the three. One of the Three are closed now sorry to say. When I visit Phoenix we always stop by for Lunch or Dinner. Wish that Los Angeles some how can pick up there flavors compared to Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food here is definitely good. The taco combination plate is my favorite. The rice and beans are perfect everytime and the shells are cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Looked up on Yelp to find a spot nearby.  It led us to El Norteno.   Omg THANK YOU YELPERS! It would not have been a place I would have stopped based on the building, but......the food was awesome.  Group had carne asana fries that were just crispy enough.  Red chile burro and green burro were both full of flavor. Will definitely return.   Yelp rules!!"}
{"text":"Cash only.

What we ordered:

Shredded Beef Tacos
Bean and Cheese Burro

I think tortillas were stale because they were broken on the tacos and the beans burst through the bottom of the burrito on the first bite and it wasn't grilled (or if it was it was barely cooked).

They do not have a salsa verde option, but their red salsa is good and isn't watered down.

Otherwise the flavor of the beans was nice.

Typical corner taco shop but the lady working there was super sweet. It was later in the evening, around 6:30pm.

Not impressed, but not the worst."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food in the valley.I have loved this food for over 20 years ."}
{"text":"I've been passing this place for decades and today is the first time I stopped in for a take out meal. The red chili burrito side of beans no rice  was the bomb. All these years gone by but today was the day like something glorious. They have mexican pizza and chicken fundido...holy heysus!"}
{"text":"Over ten years ago I use to work a few blocks away and we ordered here weekly.  I still stop in a few times a year when I'm craving their tacos and hot sauce.  I love their machaca in greasy tacos, burritos and/or salads.  Most would never think to stop due to the exterior (and even the interior), but they would be missing out on some great mexican food at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This tiny building has fantastic red chili at a great price. It was 6.95 for a plate that included tasty rice and creamy beans. I felt like I was ripping them off so I ordered a green tamale. The red chili was hotter than a lot of them out there. But it also had this fantastic creamy texture that made the red chili just melt with the meat in your mouth or rolled in a tortilla.
As you read all the reviews it is cash only. There is a tiny little building adjacent with eight booths to sit in. If you were looking for a fancy dining area or even a standard indoor dining area get your food to go because this place cannot accommodate your needs. I ate in the booths and it was a little warm in the dead of summer."}
{"text":"This place has the best tacos I have ever had.  The meat is tender and flavorful.  The cheese, lettuce and tomato are always fresh and the tomatoes are juicy.  I go out of my way to eat here.  The best mexican food I've had in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"It's sooo big! I got thee asada chimichanga. The rice is a little plain. But the Burrito is of epic size. I like it would like to try the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS FOOD.

Don't go here if you're expecting a beautiful establishment- it's on the corner, has no inside restaurant, is cash only, has a covered patio thing to eat in and a window where you pick up your food...BUT IT IS SO GOOD.

The portions are great, it is very affordable, they have a lot of different options.

Definitely a gem of a hole-in-the-wall and I am so glad I found it!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food. Their tacos are still made the way that they should be. I have been to a couple of places lately and the hard shell taco is in that molded yellow store bought thing called a taco shell! Those are only acceptable at Taco Bell...These are real tortillas! 
I have not had anything even approaching bad at this restaurant.  Carne Asada is excellent! Reasonable prices and great Mexican food. They have a daily special for breakfast, lunch and dinner, so whatever time you go there is a deall!"}
{"text":"El Norte√±o is one of those hole in the wall places that you can just look at and know that they are going to be the best Mexican food that you've had in a while! I got the carne asada chimichanga and it was sooo good! It came with beans and rice too and all for only $8.50! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Holy f$&K. Are you kidding me with the Tamale?!?!?!? PEOPLE,(!) this food is good and legit. I'm from South Texas and very critical of Mexican food.  HIGHLY CRITICAL!!!!!  Good , cheap and VERY WELL DONE. 

3rd visit and jus more of the same PERFECTION. This place is NOT Tex-mex but would still make money there. Is jus had the red chili and not once did I need salsa and the blend of spices wow, jus wow. I am now going through my reviews for other places and taking stars away."}
{"text":"Wow!  Passed by this place for years and did not realize why there was always a line of people.  Lunch special is the way to go.  Hot, fresh  and really good.   CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! Thank you for all you do! A delicious Flavor Bam all day!"}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what the fuss is all about when it comes to this place. I love the Mexican food in Colorado and New Mexico, so many of our friends recommended that we try this little hole in the wall as it was comparable. Not at all. The beans are extremely salty and the green chili was awful. My husbands food was not great either. Bottom line here is that there is nothing in this place to go bragging to your friends about. There are plenty of good Mexican restaurants that you can actually sit down and enjoy a meal at. No need to come to the shack on the corner."}
{"text":"What can you say about a place thats been open in the same spot, owned by the same family for 33yrs and isn't going anywhere. I have been a loyal customer for 32 of those years. The food is unchanged and excellent, the Red Salsa which I am addicted to and still cannot get the recipe, makes me drive 70 miles round trip to buy a quart and fresh chips, I have had everything on the menu and my personal favorite is the Chorizo egg potato and cheese with three cups of salsa inside. I have taken friends and family when they visit and all love it, Every Christmas I have to send a gallon of salsa and 5 lbs of Chorizo to cousins in Missouri. Love this place."}
{"text":"terrible; I got a side of guacamole and when I opened the container it was literally a liquid the consistency of water.. green water.. what is that?!  this was after going perhaps twice before where the food was fine, far from anything special.  After that i will never go again."}
{"text":"Cash only! Good food. Prices are up. Been going there for more than 10 years always good food. Red chile is my fav and you can put it on anything. New manager has made some good visual changes and menu changes too! 

Loyal customer."}
{"text":"In my opinion they have the best burritos in town.  Not only are they great but they are cheap.   It's a little far for me to go there so I always eat one here and have another to go.   I also enjoy their chilaquiles, a little too hot for me though but they are goooood."}
{"text":"Stay away from Comedor Guadalajara and hit this place up instead (because the service isn't rude and the food is authentic and tasty instead of bland) It's cash only but you won't need much. So good and hits the spot every time I'm craving mexican food. Lots of options around this area for good mexican food, make sure you give them a try."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place. Presently taking every ride in the park and have not found a thing I don't like.  The red chili is nice and hot the meat is tender and flavorful. The cash only policy would be a drag if the pricing wasn't so reasonable a ten spot takes you pretty far. The staff is really friendly which tells a lot!"}
{"text":"Ultimate Mexican comfort food at an amazing price. This place looks super shady from the outside and it is in a bit of rough neighborhood. I drive past it every day on my way home from work before getting on the I-10. I was curious so I looked up the reviews and was surprised to see so many great reviews on a place that looks like that!

I ordered take-out over the phone before leaving work. When I arrived, it looked even more interesting up close and inside then from the street. Basically a shack, with a sort of closed in patio as the dining area. I would never want to dine there. Not much ambience and too many crack heads wandering around.

However, the service was great. The cashier was very friendly. I grabbed my food and drove 20 minutes home with the wonderful smell of the food torturing me the whole way home.

Husband had the steak plate, I had the cheese enchilada plate. Everything was so good!! You ever get the feeling when food takes you back to happy memories? My late uncle had an amazing Mexican restaurant in Santa Ana, California. This food reminded me of his. The enchilada sauce was delectable, beans and rice perfectly cooked. Husband liked his steak as well. It was authentic without being greasy and sloppy like all those -berto places. You can tell the food is cooked with love and care. 

It takes a lot for a Mexican food restaurant to be put on my heavy rotation list with all the excellent Mexican food Phoenix has to offer. El Norteno is definitely on that list!"}
{"text":"I love \"hole in the wall\" restaurants, but this is not one that I can support. I'm shocked that this restaurant has high ratings. The food was very greasy and tasteless. The restaurant is dirty and seemingly unsanitary."}
{"text":"Green chili burro grande to go is a mainstay!!  Asada Fries and Mexican Pizza are stellar and can't miss stars. Get an order of chips and salsa too.  Seating is sparse.  Cash only. Doesn't matter, the food is the star here!!"}
{"text":"Best red chili in town. Others have beat me to it, and it's no wonder. Norteno has been serving simple Tex-Mex with local flair since 1981. It's not much to look at, for sure. After driving by for so many years, I finally gave it a whirl and ordered take-out for five to sample its many specialties.

What overwhelms is that it is home made, right there in that little building. You have to wonder how they do it, but damn! Sorry, Sylvia's. You've been de-throned.

My tastes included the red chili beef chimichanga, then smothered with more of the delicious rich red sauce. Even fried, the flour tortilla was somehow still moist and the minced beef melted like butter in my mouth. I added rice and beans like any gringo should. Yeah, the cheese on the beans was not melted by the time I got home, but how could it be? And unfortunately the stock used in the rice was not fresh, possibly cubed or powdered because its taste was explosive in some bites, absent in others. Rice was overcooked, but it was freshly made, not served for days and days after the batch was made like other places... nice.

The salsa was not the usual \"picktwosyllables\"-berto's watery vinegar, but its ground chili was brilliant. Makes a great addition to any dish: douse heavily for best results.

Norteno makes their own chorizo, and it does not disappoint. Difficult to get excited about toenails, snouts, lips and assholes, but it's Mexican Spam, and it's home made!

The only puzzle for me is that after almost 30 years they haven't got their act together for a proper dining area or a better location. Diners must take orders to go, or sit in the lean-to at tables and seating from Kyoto Bowl under bad florescent lighting. I think the owner's going over to My Florist to have a look at the space. A bit much glass for me, but it's close to her original location anyway."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to get a green burro. Extra good when you order it enchilada style."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  Great quality food & always hot. Their hot sauce/ house salsa is perfection. Wednesday lunch special of 2 Shredded beef tacos w rice & beans is excellent. Thursday Chile Relleno lunch special is also fantastic. Seating is limited and no a/c in the outside dining cage so they do a ton of carry-out. Super authentic real deal here."}
{"text":"like any other born-and-raised west coaster, i know that a hole-in-the-wall mexican restaurant is where the good food is at. el norteno doesn't let down that philosophy. i knew immediately what i wanted when i walked in: a chile relleno burrito with horchata. my boyfriend and my friends, however, didn't -- the server was nice enough to explain everything slowly, and even gave them some of the sauce to try when they asked how spicy everything was. 

on top of the super good service, the chile relleno was perfectly filled with cheese, battered, and fried. it got pretty messy eating it burrito-style though, so i had to eat it with a fork and knife. my stomach was satisfied no matter how i chose to eat."}
{"text":"Best Mexican three way, breakfast, lunch spot.  Been going here since 09. Affordable and cash only. Quick and fast service. Amazing authentic food. Simply made. Deliciousness of all flavors. So far the three way Burrito and ham and egg with light chorizo is our favorite. Huge portion sizes. If you want authentic come here :)"}
{"text":"Great Lardy Sonoran Mexican food. Been coming here for years and plan on continuing to come for years. Hot sauce is nice and garlic cumin ish. Everything in the menu is solid."}
{"text":"Oh gosh...El Norteno is so ultra-ghetto!
The building is a little sketchy, but it's the only Mexican joint I know that has green  tamales. I can't find it anywhere! 
It's not dreadful enough that I don't want to consume food here, though. 
I usually order two vegetarian tamales and the only thing I can really eat at this hole in a wall. 
It's very low-priced ($1.80 per tamale) and the pieces are....well, let's just say that after a whole day of eating almost nothing, I still could not finish my grub."}
{"text":"El Norteno is still as good as it gets I tell you."}
{"text":"I love this place. My husband used to come here as a kid. Years ago he brought me here, I'm proud to say the best cheap date ever. My favorite is the green chili burrito, but today I had their Carne Asada Taco, and they beat my taquito shop on 35th Van Buren. $2.00 for a taco and worth the money.  They only accept cash. You can phone in your orders. A must try!!"}
{"text":"Total dive. Cash only. No indoor seating. 

BEST. MEXICAN. FOOD. IN. PHOENIX.

Firstly, it may be cash only but the prices are great. Just hit the freaking ATM before you go and stop whining. They have a huge menu, so large it takes up a good portion of one of the walls of the phone booth sized area you order from inside. The tortillas are so fresh they could easily go head to head with Carolina's. The red chili is by far the best I've ever had, as noted by some fellow yelpers. Don't miss their homemade taco sauce (I think they just call it hot sauce). You'll want to buy a quart to take home. 

Don't let the exterior fool you. This place is top notch, with very friendly staff that will take good care of you. Stop by and take it home, if you can, but once you get a whiff of it, I challenge you not to pull over and devour it before you ever get on the freeway."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating at Norteno on 7 Ave..The food is always good and hot and Carlos the cook,Erica,and Evelyn are always friendly and welcoming.im there each week.it would be nice to have shade while waiting for my food."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for decades, it's the best Mexican food I have ever eaten. Thier breakfast burritos are so good... the machaca is perfect, juicy and flavorful."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food any time of day, especially from El Norteno! The prices are the best in the Valley, which matches the taste! This is what true authentic Mexican food is and if you are undecided....may I recommend anything with machaca! Anything is good just go try it because if you haven't you're missing out...no really go now!"}
{"text":"I wish I could try everything on the menu. Got pollo fundido. Delicious. The carne asada was meh. Cheese crisps were amazing. Carne asada fries were good too. We'll be back to try more. It's nothing fancy to look at but the food is what you're there for. Worth a visit!!"}
{"text":"If your wanting some good, fast and cheap mexican food this is your spot. There is no place to sit inside so your forced to sit in an enclosed area outside that is attached to the side of the building. Seeing that its Arizona makes it really hard when it comes to summer and sitting outside. 
I ordered the Sonoran Enchiladas which were amazing. It came with beans and rice which were also amazing. I will say that it was a bit spicy even without adding their hot sauce (which was ooooh so good). I also had their tamales which were so-so. I have had better tamales but they were decent enough to order again. 
The horchata was decent, but again ive had better. Its not as strong as other horchatas, its very weak in taste. If thats something your into then you will enjoy this horchata. 
Everything was decently priced, but its CASH ONLY. Something to keep in mind when coming. 
The reason for my 3 stars instead of 5, is for the simple fact that they lacked a little in customer service. The lady who took my order seemed like she didnt want to be there or help answer any questions knowing it was our first time. She also continued to help others while avioding some people including me. Worth a try, but dont be shocked at the customer service."}
{"text":"Tries to be the real thing but needs to try harder.
I order red enchiladas because I was told the red chilli sauce was irritated l prepared from scratch but it was watery and lacking in Mexican flavor."}
{"text":"The portions are simply incredible for the price at this unpretentious cash only restaurant. My impression from several visits is that the quality of food is very good, but not exceptional. I've ordered different items, that have not been highly distinguishable in terms of taste. Individual ingredients or spices could stand out more to really accentuate the flavors, and offer more overall variety."}
{"text":"Ok, Not the best part of town nor the nicest looking restaurant around, however the food is outstanding. Sonoran style Mexican food at its finest. Way better than Filbertos or LosTaquitos.  The green chili has a nice roux base and the carne asada tacos have a great blend of onions and FRESH chilies blended in.  The hot sauce is pleasently spicy.  Kind of unusual but great for parties is that they sell many items in bulk quantities for a nice discount."}
{"text":"Prices here are very fair. I ordered the chilaquiles and boy were they spicey. I won't do that again. Everything else we ordered was very good and flavorful. Their red salsa is bomb!"}
{"text":"i try and go to the mom and pop place every time i take the 25 min drive from west phoenix area, and i must say they have never disappointed me.   We like them so much we have include their food in or holiday party for the past 5+ years. 

Today i picked up our holiday order, and Lisa is allways a charm, keep up the good work, and food.

We need more places like this."}
{"text":"We'd love to visit this venue again (which seems to be my theme today -- so much to revisit and so little time...).  I've seen it almost weekly on my commute home from ASU night classes and we finally made it in a few weeks ago.  This is the kind of Mexican restaurant I truly relish.  It's the small informal business that I feel is the best way to enjoy some good Mex-American cooking.

As a vegetarian, this restaurant isn't my best friend, but it is manageable.  I ended up ordering a bean and green chili chimichanga.  It was just what it needed to be -- fried, fatty and comforting.  The horchata was really great, too, and I'm picky about my rice water ;)

Cost is low.  Service is minimal.  Ambiance is one step away from full on street dining.  Think old burger joint yellow tables and bench seats, asphalt and plastic trellis walls.

If you're looking for something fancy, turn around.  If you're looking for something to hit the spot, without any pretense, run in this direction!"}
{"text":"Meh. It's a cash only 'berto with quick prep Mexican food. The tortillas are good and fresh... Everything else was okay."}
{"text":"I really don't want to give this place 2 stars, because I've come here before and really enjoyed my meal. By based on my most recent experience, even 2 stars might be friendly.

I walked in and ordered a Number 1... so a tamale and an enchilada. Shouldn't be too difficult. Unfortunately, the ordering process was the end of my positive experience though. I sat down in their covered patio to wait for my food.

While I was waiting, a meth addict came in to give herself a shower with the wet wipes they provide on their garbage can. The entire time she was muttering profanity under her breath, and tweaking out. She wasn't really causing any problems or confronting anyone directly, but her presence seemed to put the entire patio on edge. She was in one of those mindsets of having to excessively clean everything, particularly her hands. Unfortunately, the restaurant did nothing to care for her, remove her from the premises, or ask her to stop swearing despite the amount of children also in the area. 

After sitting on edge for fifteen minutes, my order finally showed up. It looked really good! Until I took my first bite and found the centre of the tamale to be cold :( After waiting so long for the food, I was pretty disappointed to have it still be cold when I got it. The flavors were a little bland as well.

Unfortunately, I think this is the end of my excursions to El Norte√±o. There are too many good Mexican places in the area to get cold food and not be able to relax while eating it."}
{"text":"Guys, don't even think twice. Best lunch special in Phoenix: $5.45 out the door for a huge burrito (with sauce on top, no upcharge), 2 sides, and a drink. Quality food."}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the appearance.
The great little cash only restaurant has some of the best beans, rice and salsa I have had (I know that many will refute this).
The menu is what you would expect, tacos, burritos, enchiladas, etc. all at a great price, as well as lunch and dinner specials that can't be beat.
There is only outside seating, on a make-shift patio.
There is the occasional loiterer who will ask for change or food, so it is best for take-out and to-go orders. But eating there is not bad.
It is right around the corner from me and part of my neighborhood. There are always people there, and having eaten there often, I know why. My only complaint is they are cash only."}
{"text":"Great value for the money! You can come here and get a huge chorizo, egg, potato burrito for less than. $5 out the door. Cash only, try to call ahead if you have a big order."}
{"text":"This place is BOMB!!! Their breakfast burritos and salsa are the best cure for a hangover or a starved stomach. But remember to bring CASH!"}
{"text":"Incredibly cheap, chips & salsa are fresh & amazing, I've never had a complaint from anyone I've introduced to this majestic Mexican cuisine! If you want authentic Mexican food - this is your place!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I'm really not too excited bout mexican food but I went back twice in the same week while visiting Phoenix. The first time my gf wanted mexican take out & this place came up nearby so we went there & got a bean & cheese burrito, a couple of churros & some burros, wow they were Huge!!! The price is very inexpensive and the taste was great! The 2nd time we got chimichangas which were amazing! Service was very quick too! We didn't eat it there (enclosed outside patio area) neighborhood felt a little ehh, but in the little time I waited for our food we noticed quite a few locals pick up & order food after what appeared to be a long day at work. This place is poppin, I can see myself coming back again for take out next time I'm craving a burrito."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The tacos are unreal, but you really can't go wrong with anything! It's clear that this is a spot locals go to, which is always a good sign. Service was fast and they were really nice about answering all of the questions we had. I want to go back here every day."}
{"text":"I stopped in during the week for lunch was thoroughly impressed with this little hole in the wall. It's pretty easy to miss on the corner of 7th Ave and Roosevelt but it's worth every penny. I made the mistake of forgetting my cash (cash only) the first time I tried to stop here, but I cannot believe how affordable Norteno's food is.

They offer a lunch and dinner special everyday of the week (except for weekends it looks like), along with quite a few other specials and of course a normal selection of tacos, burritos, quesadillas, nachos, etc. I'd be prepared to take it back somewhere else as their seating selection is small, and outdoor (though it is enclosed), which can be sort of hot in the summer. 

I personally had the chile relleno special which came with beans, rice, and a tortilla as well as a drink for $4.99. The chile relleno was perfectly fried, smothered in a verde sauce, and saturated with cheese from within. The beans and rice were also excellent and hearty, some of the best I've had downtown. Based on other reviews, I'll definitely be back to try their red and green chile beef.

Overall I would definitely recommend this place, especially for lunch if you're working downtown. Don't be scared off by its appearance, Norteno offers excellent Mexican food."}
{"text":"Spent ten dollars for a meal I have to finish at home it's so big, plus the largest drink. Carne fries on point. Sketchy food stop of the week"}
{"text":"I thought this place was a bus stop until a coworker told me it was a restaurant.  There's always people standing there and it's REALLY small.

The dining area is only outside and well shaded.

They are cash only.

I'd go into detail about the food, but I've only been in the southwest for 6 years so almost all of the good mexican places blow my mind with how good they are.

Their chorizo is the better kind.  The kind with substance, not just oil with red food coloring like at filibertos."}
{"text":"Best ever! Machaca and egg burrito add chorizo. Chorizo has a kick to it. Tastes homemade."}
{"text":"Lets just say that this is the best Mexican food I have ever had and I've had A LOT. Not only is the food absolutely delicious but it's also really inexpensive. I ordered the #12 which includes an enchilada, a taco and a tostada for only $6.50. The tostada was tasty but nothing beyond the typical taste of a tostada. The taco was delicious, the shell tasted fresh and homemade and not store bought like some places. As for the enchilada, that's the real winner here. I have never had enchilada sauce as amazing as this one here. I only have one more day in Phoenix and I will most definitely be stopping here before heading back home. This is officially my favorite Mexican food in Phoenix!

Update: 
I went back again today before going back home to Seattle and it was even better than yesterday. I ordered the #6 this time which is two cheese enchiladas and rice and beans for only $7. I took it to-go and it was scorching hot and extremely fresh. This will definite be my go-to place whenever I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"One of the best spots in Phoenix for authentic Mexican food. I always order the red chile burrito. I go at least 3 times a week. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Although this little hole in the wall is a good, genuine Mexican style caf√©, the quality of the food varies from night to night. We went there five times and each time the food changed from the time before. The first experience was okay - the food was what other yelpers said - genuine, decent quality, etc. 

The following visits weren't all they could have been - everything from a pair of couples making out in the parking lot while loud music played to the couple who were most DEFINITELY fighting to the almost collision which we were witness to while waiting for our food.

I tried the pollo fun dido and my boyfriend had the combo platter with taco, enchilada, and tostada. The food was hot, fresh, and had that \"Mexican\" flair/flavor to it, as advertised. 

On another trip, I had the carne asada fries and he had the same combo platter with something small on the side. LOTS of food - the portions are very generous for the prices so no complaint there. 

Different night, different menu choices - I tried the shredded beef chimichanga with rice and beans - we added chips once or twice - everything was edible, nothing went to waste.

Any suggestions I may have? Perhaps longer hours on Friday and Saturday nights - you know, for us late night noshers. They close at 10 pm most nights and at 8 on Sunday. I appreciate the desire to take only cash for transactions, but I think this is probably a crimp in some people's ability to pay - not everyone carries cash! However that being said, the bookkeeper in me sees a lot of issues with the cash method. 

We give them 3 stars because they aren't terrible but they sure don't compare to our beloved La Canasta down the way on 7th Ave."}
{"text":"I'm a self proclaimed Mexican food junkie. I like it all. From fancy, overpriced designer tacos to IDK if I should be eating here type of places. El Norteno if my very favorite place to get a really great AFFORDABLE meal. When I say affordable, I mean Filiberto's affordable but the food is like you'd expect from a old school restaurant. The girl that works the counter is very friendly and helpful with suggestions.

I'd eat their Steak Picado plate every day of the week. Seriously. Their beans and rice are perfection. So are the tortillas. Green chile is super hot but can't be beat. The red sauce is great too. Order a side of chips and sauce!

Downsides: 
The tiny ordering area indoors. No big deal but everyone seems to want to loiter inside making it hard to squeeze in there to place an order. I get it, it's hot out but c'mon y'all, be considerate and let others in to order. There is a small window on the outside you can use but it's usually used to pass out the orders. 

The sketchy outdoor eating area. It just doesn't look clean. We always take our food to go and head over to a park to enjoy our food. 

Other than that... BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN PHOENIX. Period."}
{"text":"Bring cash! They are also closed on Sunday now. However, this is the BEST Mexican food in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"I ate here the other night and had an assortment of items: shredded beef taco, chicken and cheese enchilada, green corn tamale, green chile, and a tostada. Yes, I know, I am a fat-ass. Deal with it. All the food was fairly mediocre and not at all impressive. Both the green chile and enchilada sauce had a gravy-like consistency and almost had some flavor familiarities as well. The masa of the tamale was a bit dry, and did not have the sweetness I have come to love. Not much to say about the taco and tostada, pretty standard Sonoran fare, but I have had much better elsewhere.

Now to the staples. This is where they earned a few points. While none were stellar, the beans, rice, and flour tortillas were pretty good. The tortillas tasted homemade, but could be purchased from a local tortilleria. They also stay open later than most restaurants in Phoenix.

Also, worth a mention the only area to eat is an enclosure bordered by some walls and security doors on either side. It almost feels like you're in jail and I imagine its sweltering on a hot summer day. If you've had a few stints in tent city you will feel right at home (minus the pink underwear)."}
{"text":"Right on the corner of Roosevelt and 7th street is where this little hole in the wall stands. If you blink.. Well you might pass it.
El Norteno has the best green and red chili burros! Hands down!
I always get a few orders to go because coming from Scottsdale is quite out of the way... So I usually order 3 green and 3 red!
For Christmas Eve, I get a few pints of their green chili to serve piping hot to the family and boy do they love it! They always ask me where I got it, but this secret is safe with me."}
{"text":"Awesome little easy access hole in da wall. I concur with other positive reviews! Very friendly staff, constant take out traffic. If you can't finish your portion which is served hot in an aluminum cake pan just ask for a lid to take home!"}
{"text":"I grew up eating this as a kid and I still love it  even if I move far away in Arizona I will still make that drive for a red burro enchilada style"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes so much yes! I have driven past el norteno at least a hundred times and never stopped....why? It looks a little intimidating. Well fear not friends! The food here is more than legit. I got a mixed red and green chili pork chimichanga with rice and beans to go...... This thing weighed no less than 3 pounds....it was insane! Also, it cost less than 10$ (cash only...wah wah). It was more than enough for the husband and I to share. The flavor was delightful. The salsa they included was spicy, the chilis were rich and flavorful.... It was like heaven in a styrofoam box. I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and they also have great prices . Love getting the daily special you can get it for under  $6 bucks . The only downfall is that they only take cash but still giving them 5* for the great fast Mexican food. The girls at the window have great customer service .  Not bad for being a small place it's better than a lot of bigger and fancier places I've been too . Please keep the same quality of food and service. Thanks"}
{"text":"I was in the area and craving great Mexican street food.  They do not use a great tortilla, so their burrito is just ok.  I never understand why places skimp on the tortilla which makes all the difference in the world.  These are flavorless.  Their beans and rice are decent but nowhere near as delicious as La Santisima.  I wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"Really good food. The sauce that they give you is amazing, just enough heat but not too much. 
Vegetarians beware: the enchilada sauce appears to have bits of meat in it. As one myself, cheese enchiladas with Mexican food is a staple so I was upset to find it in the sauce."}
{"text":"Let's be honest here...  the place looks scary from the outside, it's in a revitalization part of town, and it's cash only.  The staff can be rude (think soup nazi from Seinfeld) and the wait can be horrible at times.  There is no indoor seating and parking is crazy during the lunch rush.  But on the flip side, the food makes it all worth while once you can get past all of the pitfalls.  I love a good cheese enchilada and this place has them.  They make them the way I like them, baked... not just a tortilla with cheese and sauce thrown together like other fast food mexican restaurants (the 'Bertos chains ain't got nothin' on this place!).   I crave them constantly.  I've never had a bland or yucky enchilada from them.  Their shredded beef tacos are amazing, but every now and then they come out super greasy.  But who doesn't like a greasy taco?  The chile relleno is very tasty, but every now and then the seeds get in the way.  There is just something about the cheese and sauce that keeps me eating it, spitting out the chili seeds as I go along. The prices are reasonable, especially the lunch specials.

I've eaten there at least 30 times in the past two years and haven't regretted it once.  To each his own, but the folks who have left negative reviews about the service must not know the place or the system.  You have to play their game and understand that there are enough of us who love their food to outweigh any business lost from people who expect superior service.  Just an honest observation... not trying to say their reviews aren't accurate, they probably are right on point.  Bad things probably happen, but when you find awesome food that you can't get anywhere else, you learn to accept being treated like a number.

Bottom line, amazing food, iffy service, horrible location, worth the trip for takeout."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY

Price is affordable. I ordered the #9 chile relleno. It wasn't bad but, not the best I've had. If your in a pinch this will do. 

The rice and beans are extremely good and the horchata wasn't all sugar like other places. 

Definitely a casual place just to hang and grab a quick bite. It's outdoor seating. Clean enough for the area it's located in."}
{"text":"I had been staying downtown for a few weeks while my kitchen was being remodeled. I drove by this place twice a day and was drawn to it but didn't stop in because I assumed it was one of those places that use cilantro in everything (I'm one of the most anti-cilantro people ever). I finally went in and asked, what doesn't have cilantro? The lovely young lady looked at me like I was crazy and said, ummmm we don't really use that, I think it's in the carne asada tacos. So I got the fundido and the bf got the carne asada quesadilla. Both were incredible. The chips and salsa were fresh and it was a huge portion. Best salsa I have had in a loooooong time. I will be back. 5 stars on Yelp and a 4/5 on the Cilantrometer because cilantro was there, but in minimal use. Only way to get 5/5 is to not have it in house at all. Gracias El Norte√±o!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican food in Phoenix! Better than Carolina's & La Tolteca. The green sauce is ridiculously good. The rice is superb. It may not have the most attractive location / curb appeal but the food is outstanding. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a filling Mexican meal on the cheap look no further. This little CASH ONLY spot will feed that hole in your stomach through the hole in your face without putting a hole in your pocket. Staff is attentive, quick, and on the ball. Phone orders are very quickly prepared for pick up. 

The hard shell tacos will melt your face off, I am fairly certain they deep fry tortillas for each hard shell . The green chili chimi, enchilada style is simply unbeatable. $5.50 gets you a chimichanga the size of an 8 week old child, smothered in enchilada sauce, cheese, sour cream, and guacamole... WHO DOES THAT!? 

There is seating in the style of Mexican Street food with a covered patio that is in the no frills parking lot. If you came for frills, though, you are in the wrong place. If you came for the best chimichanga and tacos of your life, then step up to the window and pull up a chair."}
{"text":"Easily one of the top places to get Mexican food if you're in the downtown area. I've brought coworkers here who've all enjoyed it. The portions are great, especially for the price, and the daily special is always a tasty selection no matter which day of the week. Unfortunately, for us adventurous eaters, they don't offer lengua or cabeza, but they do have all the standards (chicken, pork, ground beef or carne asada). The salsa that comes in the bottles is especially great if you like to add a little judo to your food (autocorrect picked judo over kick but I'm keeping it)."}
{"text":"I can Give you the best review for this place because I live a block away and have eattin there on a number of occasions... I really only go there for there for their red chili burros or menudo which is my option rate pretty darn good most of the time. I've ordered their hard tacos they absolutely suck! they are all lettuce and cheese, I'm sorry but wheres the meat??? this is a hit or miss kind of place and all depends what day you go on and what you order. my recommendation's are burros red and green, menudo weekends only, the machaca plate or to all together hit up azteca or la torteca witch are better and in the same area... eat good!"}
{"text":"After a long day of driving I was so hoping the 4 star reviews would not steer me wrong.  From rice and beans to burrito or tacos the food was bland or over spiced that you could not tolerate the taste. Skip if you have a choice."}
{"text":"Heaven in a box! This tiny little dump is amazing.

I got a little nervous when I pulled up and I saw that the restaurant was more of a four walled building with an oven inside than an actual sit down place, but I was not disappointed. Big portions, great taste, and good value.

Only drawback is that the sitting area isn't air conditioned so in the summer it gets pretty toasty and there are a number of flies buzzing at your plate. Nevertheless, the food is awesome and I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I love this spot you will be surprised. Don't judge the place on looks alone, everything is BOMB!  The salsa is great!"}
{"text":"Holy Mexican Pizza Batman! I used to crave Taco Bell Mexican pizzas and now they've been 1+d for sure. This place gives you massive amounts of Mexican deliciousness for poquito dinero (I'm no Spanish pro but I meant little money lol) The #19 steak meal was delicious tambien (also giggety!) Don't pass this place by because it's tiny and easy to miss!"}
{"text":"Cash only. My only issue.

I love their red sauce. Just love it. A large bag of chips is $3 and comes with 12 oz of the sauce. A small bag is $2 and comes with 6 oz of the sauce. It's the best red sauce I've ever had.

I love their carne asada, but my girlfriend doesn't like their cheese so I go myself now."}
{"text":"I've never been here before, but ever since I started working in PHX this summer, I've only heard good things about it. I went in and got the special of the day, the gorditas. The girls working inside are polite and get you your food fast. Prices are cheap too!"}
