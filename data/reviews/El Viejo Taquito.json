{"text":"This place is not for the trendy or hipster crowd but if you want a fantastic authentic meal this the place.  My wife and I had breakfast and the service is great the food is fresh and very flavorful."}
{"text":"We were told to go here from the guys that work down the street. The place is one of those small hole in the wall places, but the food was decent. My hubby got the chorizo burrito and I the bacon. His burrito was really good, but my bacon was crispy and I hate crispy bacon...but I didn't tell them so I ate it anyway. I also wasn't too crazy about my eggs but I like well done scrambled, so not docking for that either. I think it just may be the owners working, cute nice older people...of course she was cooking :). Probably try something on their menu when in the area again."}
{"text":"Amazing! Amazing!  We lived in Puebla, Mexico for a year and deeply missed the food from there.  Having this around the corner will be a new family favorite for us.  We love any of their street tacos!"}
