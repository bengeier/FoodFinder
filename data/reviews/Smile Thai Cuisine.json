{"text":"Food is great. Love the avocado curry. The pumpkin curry is delicious, as well. We've been coming here for a few years and always enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from out of town, ordered pickup, which was ready quick. Staff was very friendly, the place was very clean and smelled great when I walked in. When I got back to my hotel I was impressed on how everything was packed and separated. The food amazing and was still hot! They also packed a fork and chopsticks too."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Candlelit, YouTube videos of Thai foodie travelers on overhead TVs, menus look like little newspapers (adorable)  Service: Friendly, attentive--there was only one server both times we were there so keep that in mind if you're dining-in in the middle of a lunch/dinner rush.  Food/Drink: Delicious pad see eew (we had ours with beef). There were different meats/vegetarian styles of the entrees. If you've never had Thai food, a lot of it is similar to Vietnamese and Malaysian.   Heads-Up: The scent of Jasmine comes at you quick when you walk in (for anyone chemically sensitive). I only saw one accessible parking space in front of the restaurant, but I don't know if there's more around the area. Good for dates, double dates, might be difficult for large parties.   This Place is For You If:  -You like heat but your friend thinks toothpaste is spicy (options!)  -You're craving Vietnamese but already had pho like 8 times this week -You don't mind the scent equivalent of eating in the middle of a garden -You genuinely like genuine Thai food"}
{"text":"Great soup Great lunch specials  Great service  Our Thai spot in Tempe.   Try the silver noodles on the lunch menu during the day and any of their duck laden soups. We crave the noodles there. Go spicy."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  The place looks very simple but warm and clean.  The food was super tasty and the lady that served us was great.  We had some CC issues and she was very patient and kind until it all got resolved.  Thank you!:)  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place has to be one if my favorites! I love orange chicken that is crunchy, perfectly cooked and the fact there is NEVER grease on any meals and the authenticity is there I have no choice to give them 5 stars. I am extremely picky when it comes to Thai food. In fact I only used to eat at one place which was out of town. Then I gave a few a go and told myself ill never eat at another Thai cuisine again unless it was my favorite one.  Then I ordered this place and wow.  It turns my favorite spot to my 2nd.   Ive been around the united states and besides this one place in San Fran. This is my go to spot at least once a weak.  The owner is young and cooks herself and keeps the place spotless!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Thai place. The service is always very kind and friendly. The server remembers us now. They always have tasty specials. This time I got the tom yum fried rice. It was tasty. I haven't had anything like it before, with the hot and spicy flavor in rice form, but not overwhelming. I usually get the pad see we, which is amazing. The pad Thai is also delicious, I just don't like peanuts. The restaurant has a pleasant atmosphere. Always very clean. I also like the music. They sometimes play odd jazzy covers of pop songs. And sometimes what I think is Thai pop music? Either way, it's relaxing. Great place to go for dinner. I hope to come for lunch soon, too."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of Thai food, but this place is slowly demolishing the wall of distaste around my tastebuds! Tom Yum soup was a bowl of flavor explosion. Sour AND spicy! Minus one star for lack of white rice served with entree. Also, if you visit during the sunset hour in the summer time the sun blares directly in the restaurant and is hard to avoid. They have sun shades but they don't really help. Just a heads up! Enjoyed the food and will be back to explore more items off the menu!"}
{"text":"It wasn't very good, lacked flavor the crab wontons were cold.   The pad Thai was flavorless too. Not under standing the perfect rating unless that's all friends and family."}
{"text":"I love this place! Came in for dinner a few nights ago. It's cute, very clean, quiet, cozy but not too cramped. The waitress was pleasant. Food came pretty fast and was normally priced for a Thai place. Great texture on the tofu but the egg plant stir fry was a little more oily than I would have liked. They accommodated making a meal vegetarian with no fuss. Don't be fooled by the sketchy location-this place is a gem."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week. I have a pad Thai hankering that borders on addiction. I have tried so many Thai restaurants in the phx area and this place has THE BEST pad Thai. And the price is great. $9 lunch special and $11 dinner plate. The staff is always friendly and efficient. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Loved it here. The Thai chai is delicious and the spring rolls too. Nice and sweet server."}
{"text":"Did not enjoy my meal at all.  Had to wash the leftovers in the sink in order to eat them the next day.  Ordered the orange chicken.  My wife had the pad Thai and was disappointed.  Will certainly not return."}
{"text":"Very friendly servers , great food and a wonderful date night! I will be going back here again soon. You could say that it made me smile :)"}
{"text":"Great environment overall with very friendly staff. Food is also amazing especially their specials. Would definitely recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Delicious.... I had the Basil fried rice and an order of veggie rolls, absolutely satisfying. Also had the Thai iced coffee that was very good.. customer service was great, can't really say I have any complaints about this place! I will be eating here again for sure!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Great food and service. We had crazy drive getting lost on way to a seminar and found this place on Yelp just on time! Our waitress took great care of us and put a rush on our Mango Chicken Curry and Thai iced tea....but you would never know it! Presentation was beautiful. Instagram worthy. Delicious. Enough for two but order extra rice because entree comes with small  amount. Definitely seeking this place out next time I'm in the area. I'm a foodie and blogger so I usually try new places all the time. This place is a sure bet."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant, and I was pleasantly surprised. It has a very nice ambience, and very authentic food. I got the chowmein with chicken and shrimp (prawn, as it was mentioned in the menu), and it was delicious. However, one thing that the place did fall short on, was the time the food took to be served. We were a large group of ~15 people, and some of us didn't get the food until after 45 mins. However, since it's a family owned business, it's understandable. If their service could have been faster, I would've rated this restaurant 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is now under new management and since then the place just went downhill. Food is bland and one of my dishes, it was as though they chopped up a whole garlic and threw it on my meal portions suck too. We'll give it a few months and see if they have their shit figured out"}
{"text":"New ownership and the food and service here is amazing! I can honestly say that I have not had better Lao/Thai food in the valley. The staff is very attentive, friendly and the dishes they offer are nothing short of delicious! I think they have something very special here :)"}
{"text":"Simply the best Thai Food in town . Food is so fresh and different  We had the Avocado Curry and it was fantastic. Don't look any further"}
{"text":"Really good! I usually go to another Thai restaurant but this was surprisingly good. Under new ownership and slight name change but service was excellent and the restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"I went here upon a friend's recommendation.  Although there are many Thai restaurants in Tempe, ease of parking and prices and location are big factors when trying a new restaurant.  I'm super glad I tried it  because it was 9pm Friday night and we were looking for something sitdown and a hot meal after a long night. To start, the hostess was dressed in a traditional dress and the restaurant was modern, clean and organized.  We began with salad rolls with chicken about $9 for 3 large.  Delicious especially with mint.  Salad rolls are our benchmark for Thai.  It was plump and filling, split amongst us 5.  The peanut sauce was not smooth but that's ok because it meant it was homemade.  The sweet dipping sauce was tasty and the plating was very pretty!  I ordered the garlic chicken and I think for about $12, I couldn't believe the huge portion of all chicken!  I had leftovers. There were no veggies or fillers and so in a small very tiny way, I was disappointed because I had none to eat with all that chicken.  In my party, we also ordered the noodles with chicken, wide rice noodles with chicken which tasted great, a little like pad see eew and again prettily plated.  We also ordered the chicken fried rice and the yellow curry.  Again, impressive portion of chicken + veggies for about $12-$13.  You have the choice of beef, tofu and seafood for all the entrees.  Big portions enough to share for a party of 5-6 if 4 entrees ordered.  While waiting and eating we watched a Thai food tv show and it made me even more hungry while waiting for our food.  I can't wait to return and try the seafood hot pot next time."}
{"text":"Disappointed in how much this place changed from smile Leo Thai. We LOVED the old place and would order there at least twice a week. Recently were due for a surprise when everything was different. We will give this place a few months before returning back. I pray they figure out a way to be more like the original restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food & cute nice waitresses serving. Solid place. I had the usual pad Thai chicken basil & shrimp appetizer"}
{"text":"We ordered Tom yum fried rice (a bit sour), drunken noodle (not flavorful enough), and a thai iced tea with grass jelly (this was good)."}
{"text":"Great food, quick service. I got the tofu pad Thai and it was delicious. The two people I went with got different kinds of curry, which they both enjoyed. One small thing is that they both got Thai hot and didn't think that it was very spicy."}
{"text":"Loved the food here. Their Thai iced tea portion is HUGE! The red Thai curry was pretty good. Definitely try their Mee Kathi, it was delicious."}
{"text":"Accommodated a large party before closing. Food was fresh and delicious. Service was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town for one night and tried this place instead of fighting the crowds and long wait in old town. We were very pleased with our choice! The location was easy to find, the food was authentic and so yummy!! Service was outstanding! Would definitely recommend to all!"}
{"text":"Great Thai spot with solid lunch specials. Staff is friendly and always warm when you enter the door. I had their Panang curry with pork and it was some of the best in the valley that i've had. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Thai places we have been in the area! Our dish had a ton of chicken in it which is rare for most Thai places. The curry was amazing and we will deff be coming back!"}
{"text":"Place located in a small shopping center. I came in around 2 p.m. therefore I am not sure if I miss the lunch rush. Very clean restaurant and nice waitress.   Ordered the Panang Chicken curry lunch special. It comes with a creamy soup ( very good), egg roll, and white rice. The food was very good. Vegetables were tender and the chicken were cooked just right."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Fresh and clean good variety of food. Highly recommend trying you won't regret it."}
{"text":"It used to be Smile Lao Thai, under new ownership it is Smile Thai.  it is still good.  All the different friends I have taken there have liked it also."}
{"text":"This restaurant should be called Delicious Thai Cuisine, love this place. Just had the avocado curry, one of the best curry's I've had in a long time. The egg rolls are really crispy (mouth watering) everything was EXTREMELY fresh !! Can't recommend enough. The restaurant itself has a very warm/ nice design and our server Bo, was very nice. Thumbs up !!!"}
{"text":"AWESOME, DELICIOUS , sooo good! Best Tai food in Tempe!! Super friendly service!! From the crispy pork with the sticky rice and the seafood (big scallops and shrimp)Pad See Eew to the mango crepe cake, everything was so delicious! This is definitely a great place for some delicious Thai food!!"}
{"text":"Great service and nice atmosphere. The noodles there are really good as well as the curry. Looking forward to try their mango sticky rice next time!"}
{"text":"Turn that frown upside down! I was sad when the original Smile Lao Thai changed owners and no longer offered Laotian cuisine but I was willing to try the new chef's creations at Smile (Lao-less) Thai. The decor seems pretty much the same, with a lush interior and relaxing elegant feel.   The menu offers most of what you'd see on any Thai restaurant menu in the Phoenix area, but I was also excited to see they also offer more hard to find items such as khao soi. I went with the green curry with tofu, medium spice level. It came out in an elegant bowl with a domed scoop of white rice. The curry itself was more on the sweeter side and lacked the depth of flavor that predecessor Smile Lao Thai had, but it was still an enjoyable meal. The curry had a wide variety of vegetables, including Thai eggplant. As for the spice level, it was maybe 3 or 4 out of 10 in terms of heat.   Service was very friendly and sweet.   Since I'm still on the lookout for a good khao soi so I'll be back to try it out and other dishes off the menu!"}
{"text":"We were delighted with this restaurant, which seemed unassuming from the outside but delivered consistent quality in the deliciousness and presentation of their food. The menu is extensive and flexible in that all the entrees can be ordered with the addition of a variety of proteins, including meat, fish, and tofu.  My father ordered some egg rolls, which came 6 to an order, and were crispy and full of vegetables. We ordered a second basket that came up short by one egg roll and the kitchen sent three more to compensate.  I chose a panang curry with duck. Duck is great! I got a couple bites that were a bit tough but generally the meat was soft and rich. I ordered the curry at the high level of spiciness and it was perfectly hot. The curry itself is perfect, rich and thick. I tasted my mom's drunken noodles with salmon and a bit of hubby's eggplant and found them land in comparison but they enjoyed their meals so that's what counts. I tasted my dad's food too but was too bored to remember what it was. My dad's not an adventurous eater.   Very good!"}
{"text":"Had a house special noodles in coconut curry and loved it.  Good service and ambience. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a random mid-afternoon lunch, was VERY pleasantly surprised!  Decor: Modern and simple, consistent with mid tier trendy bistros. Both intimate and open settings, which unexpectedly works well. Clean.   Service: Very fast, courteous and professional.   Food: I got the prawn (shrimp) pad Thai lunch special which comes with a cream-style Tom Yum soup (very good) and egg roll. The pad Thai portion was generous; food was flavorful and hearty, with just the right amount of spice.   Overall, I'd definitely come back again and look forward to trying other items on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Ordered fried pork but in the picture it showed pork bits fried and looked delicious but when we got our order it was pork ribs ..??? And the chowmein looked like sphaghetti noodles and there were no veges ... no one ate it in our party. Although I have to say the pad woon sen was delicious."}
{"text":"The flavors and the cost definitely made me smile. I had the Pad Eggplant and was delighted there were no noodles- all kinds of veggies in a flavorful brown sauce. The surroundings are black and gold from floor to candle holders. A nice surprise to find in a suburban mall. You should go!"}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food indeed! The Tom Yum soup was amazing; served hot with a mini heating candle below the bowl. Also ordered the yellow curry which was very good but served with a suboptimal serving of rice (-1 ). Overall, Smile Thai is the best Thai food I've had in the area. Excited to go back and try more entrees. Wouldn't go at sundown again though. The sun beats through the front window and there is not anywhere in the restaurant to avoid it."}
{"text":"Hands down best pad sew ew ever. No joke, I order it once every 1-2 weeks since the year started. I finally ate at the restaurant with my mom and my boyfriend and it met all of our expectations. My mom ordered the Tom Ka soup and my boyfriend ordered the pad thai. Also very good! Highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"First time here and it was fabulous! The lunch special is great as you get a good soup and not some dried up veggies in broth like most places. Tom Ka was great as was spring roll and my chicken pad thai. Service was fabulous and the place was rockin' busy.  My friend had yellow curry that was just to her liking and she is super picky. I can't wait to come here more often for Thai Tea!!! All of the different variations of chili is a huge score in my book!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it's consistent- nice middle ground thai food in my opinion."}
{"text":"Ordered take out here about an hour before close. The woman helping me was friendly and patient. The Tofu with sweet Basil is delicious! The steamed rice was cooked perfectly. Also ordered Spring Rolls, so fresh! Great vegetarian options here. I'm very happy with my late order. Took about 15 minutes to be ready and was packed perfectly. While I was waiting, a few other people came to pick up their phoned-in orders, good sign of how the food was going to taste! The interior of this place is quaint and intimate. Pleasantly pleased with everything, I will be back to dine in and get the Coconut Ice Cream!"}
{"text":"Hm, I believe this establishment underwent a management change just over a month ago but that doesn't mean the quality of the food has changed! Though the old place was good, this place is great!! Though I've only been here a handful of time, some dishes you can't go wrong with are: drunken noodle, avocado curry and the nam khao tod. If you're in the area, do yourself the favor and stop by!! The wait staff, and I believe the owner(?), are very attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Tempe. The avocado green curry is incredible. I went in the middle of the day during the summer when everyone leaves town, so I was the only one there and the staff was surprisingly unattentive given that fact, but that might not be characteristic of the place."}
