{"text":"The food was ok but it's hard to enjoy it when the person who takes the order seems to resent you being there.  I will not come back since good customer service is vital to the experience and this restaurant didn't have it today. I hope other customers have a better experience, and that the person who served me has a better day tomorrow."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this restaurant. I've eaten from their truck (Which gets a 5 star rating), but the sit down, dine-in experience was not the same!

I ordered the mahi-mahi fish tacos. They were really tasty, if not a little large (hard to fit into my mouth, so it turned really messy). There was a lot of flavour going on: guacamole, light and airy fish tacos, coleslaw and a chipotle mayo. There were aromatic flavours, sour, sweet; everything was really well rounded. The textures were also extremely complimenting.

My boyfriend got the beef burrito. It was really quite small! He said it was tasty, but we could have easily gotten comparable food, but much more of it for the same price from mucho burrito! 

For the 15 minute drive, I don't know if I'll be rushing back, but it was still a tasty experience."}
{"text":"My friend and I went March 20 for dinner.  Where to start!?  It was a disaster.  The staff were too busy socializing with each other to pay attention to anyone.  There was ONE waitress tending to 5-6 full tables.  We asked for water no ice - both came with ice.  It took 30 minutes to get crab cakes which sat at our table for 10 minutes while we waited for cutlery (even then she brought me two knives then took another 5 minutes for her to get a fork).  Crab cake barely had any crab, it was all flour.  Waited another 45 minutes for our mains while we sat and watched the staff look at pictures on cell phones, by then the place was closing up.  So we scarfed down our food (fish taco's were ok).  Overall this place is poorly managed.  They had enough staff but they just weren't focused.  I wouldn't go back to this location.... EVER!"}
{"text":"I got mild food poisoning from this place. I ordered a gringo bowl with chicken. 

It was pretty tasty though, a bit salty.

Would not go again."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good atmosphere for the price. We had the fish tacos and vegan burritos and they were great."}
{"text":"We were in the area for the first time for a doctor's appointment.  We drove around the area to find something quick for takeout.  I didn't want any chain places and saw this location tucked inside a strip mall.  The line was long, but the food ended up being incredibly good.  We had three tacos - Barbacoa, Pork Canitas, and Chicken Tinga.  I would say the Barbacoa and Chicken were both really great.  The pork carnitas unforutnately were kind of bland.  We wish we had ordered more!  More people seemed to be ordering the burritos, maybe more filling?  Anyways, if I am in the area I would definately come back"}
{"text":"I ordered take out from this place about a week ago and omg it was horrible!! The churrors were raw you see that it wasn't fully cooked through so those went in the garbage. the guacamole was horrible, when you scoop it onto the chip it was stringy and there was no zest In it. that also went into the garbage. the soup I ordered it had sausage bacon and a bunch of other stuff in it was tasteless and bland, that also got thrown out. I called back to see about a refund because it was $35. They said the best they could do was a 10 off out next order. Pretty sure if it was nasty the first time we had take out, why would we waste out money gas and time to get nasty food again. They probably couldn't afford to give us back out refund, and when we went to order the food there was 1 couple in there.

If you're looking for real amazing Mexican food, I suggest you try Made In Mexico on Main  St in Newmarket, where there food is actually Mexican there food is never raw or undercooked and has flavour."}
{"text":"The food is tasty. Inconsistent \"portion control\" on visits. Not much value. Never have  empanadas available (TAKE IT OFF YOUR LOCATION menu) the fish tacos are apparently what they are known for, haven't had them. And considering they don't even carry empanadas unless you order in advance (24hours) and  For the times I visit it's quite quiet in the restaraunt I'd be concerned to purchase a seafood item, fresh anyone? And the place is   inexcusable dirty for the lack of activity in the store. The floors, the tables the counters can be cleaned and give a \"welcome\" atmosphere and considering they are quiet there is no excuse for lack of clean or welcome atmosphere. There is a lack of team in the employee, I.e was ordering takeout when a new staff member was being trained and the \"trainer\" was not supportive, demoing how to do things, ...there is just better ways to treat, teach and talk to people, it does not matter the industry, your behaviour, your style, your approach always matter. Will give the place one more shot, the food is good, the service \"tries\", it needs to be cleaned, the place needs to have TRUE pride in everything. Just don't want to feel Awkward any longer in there."}
{"text":"Terrible service and management, they tried to weasel their way out of their all you can eat promotion. A group of friends and I went for the 20 dollars all you can eat taco special which was advertised on their website, front door, and menu, we even called that afternoon to confirm the offer was still on and were told it was. When we ordered the AYC special the waitress immediately started acting weird and asked if all 4 of us were sure wanted the special.  She then said she didn't know how it worked and had to call the owner on the phone, who apparently told her the promotion was over, despite the ad being on the website and the front door.  We started to walk out and the waitress then said it was tied to being over 19 as you had to buy a beer to get the special (this wasn't on any of the ads).  When we said we were all over 19 she started panicking and said she'd give us the deal but would get in big trouble with her boss.  We thought it was sketchy so we just left but it was very clear to us that as soon as the waitress saw 4 guys in their mid twenties come into get the AYC taco special she panicked and lied about the offer expiring. It's their loss at the end of the day as I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Mixed. Had the Mahi Mahi and it was a bit soggy but good. Good thing about this place is its so close to home. Beats driving downtown for the better tacos. 50/50 if I will consider coming back."}
{"text":"Foods great but when they get busy they get backed up and they're hot plate only heats up 4 burritos at a time . You order how you want your burrito made from menu ( I wasn't asked if I wanted to add sour cream or guacamole to my chicken tinga burrito made gourmet style probably cause they were super busy ... So its understandable ,and the burrito even without guac ,and sour cream ,was so awesome , I didn't even miss them .
 It was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"It's a simple place, but they have a great, fresh, well prepared Mexican food!
You cannot go wrong with the burrito or they burrito bool"}
{"text":"I've always been a supporter of gourmet gringos when they first started on their truck. Their fish tacos are untouchable, hands down best in Toronto. However, this franchise is a total misrepresentation of them. Batter was thick and soggy, nacho chip were stale and hard, worst was the limes; days old and dry to the core... Not a single drop of juice on all the wedges. This franchise lacks passion I am so used to seeing so often at their truck events."}
{"text":"Too much gringo, not enough gourmet. Pico is overly chunky and hasn't been allowed the time to sit. Salsa verde from a jar. Raw onion everywhere, mayo chipotle sauce in the burrito... It's good Mexican style food, but it's not Mexican food. On the same page as Mucho Burrito in my book."}
{"text":"I don't know about fish tacos ... I am vegetarian ... Vegetarian food sucks ... 
I tried 4 things and all were equally bad .."}
{"text":"Going to have to downgrade my previously glowing review. Ordered the exact same 3 tacos I had previously; chicken Tinga, beef Barbacoa and carne Asada. 

This time around the meat portions were meager and small. The beef in the Asada was no longer full chunks but thin slices that were dried out. The Barbacoa was OK and the Tinga was also OK. 

That said the toppings were also non existent AND the tortillas for my tacos were soggy and falling apart. 

I had high hopes for this place but day staff don't seems to have much passion for what they're doing as the original staff did. 

This was an OK experience. Not one I would travel 40 KM for as I did today 

Hoping they turn this around

Eatcrest out"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place by accident... I had intentions to go elsewhere for my Mexican fix, but ended up seeing the \"Gringo's\" sign and decided, \"why not!\"   At first glance, the restaurant wasn't busy... Which surprised me considering it was around 12:30.  I ordered my typical Mexican fare, a chicken burrito.  I was given the choice between pulled chicken or grilled chicken, and opted for the pulled.  Toppings were scarce, and the chicken seemed very greasy.  The staff assured me the chicken was made in-house, and not cooked, frozen, and shipped over.

This burrito was definitely more greasy and saltier than others I've tasted.  I was clutching a bottle of water all day after lunch, which I wasn't too happy about.... Felt full pretty much for the rest of the day afterwards.

All in all, if you're looking for a real greasy burrito, this is the place to check out.  Not a fresh Mexican joint at all."}
{"text":"This place was disgusting.  I waited 45 mins for any food to come out and everything was bland.  Not worth it at all"}
{"text":"Gourmet Gringos is a small, clean place with efficient service.   The good:  excellent fish tacos!  The bad: Guacamole was super bland, basically tasted like mashed, plain avocado.  Also, the steak taco was way under-seasoned.  Maybe I was spoiled living in California with Mexican food?  I would only go back if I had a craving for fish tacos."}
{"text":"Totally unimpressed with this place.

After such an amazing experience at the nearby Mucho Burrito, my boyfriend and I thought we'd give Gourmet Gringos a shot. Upon walking in, we had high hopes since the restaurant was well kept and had tell tale signs of being authentic Mexican (ie. the Spanish music).

You have 2 options. Either order at the cash, and take food to go. Or sit down to enjoy a more restaurant-y experience. We chose the latter.

We were delighted to see that each entree comes with 2 sides. More bang for our buck! We placed our orders. I ordered a burrito which I excitedly asked to be made vegan since they state on their menu that they accommodate for veganism, with a side of rice and salad. I forget the name of the dish my boyfriend ordered, but he also ordered rice and salad as his sides.
The server was nice enough, but seemed a little absent-minded, and we had to ask multiple times for napkins and hot sauce. She only had 2 other tables, so her forgetfulness seemed inexcusable. The food came, and at the first sight, we were unimpressed. The quantity of food we received didn't seem to be enough. And the sides were served in tiny little bowls, which only made them seem less than what they were (and trust me... there wasn't much to begin with). But I tried not to judge until I tasted the food.

And then I tasted the food. The rice was nothing special. A little bland. The salad was what a salad is - mixed vegetables. Again, nothing special (but salads usually aren't, so I won't use this against them). The burrito had sour cream in it. Which aggravated me because I specifically asked for it to be made vegan. It's hard for me to understand why a restaurant that specifically states that they accommodate veganism would mess up a vegan order. 

But moving on. My boyfriend's portion was small. It would have passed as an appetizer, but hard to envision as an entree.

Also, WHERE WAS THE CILANTRO?! This is a Mexican restaurant, and not a leaf of cilantro was to be found. Tsk, tsk. SHAME.

Our only saving grace was the churros. They were delicious, no complaints here!

I won't be returning to Gourmet Gringos. You'll find me at Mucho Burrito eating my fresh, fully vegan, cilantro-filled burrito :)"}
{"text":"Ya know what I think there is starting to be too many of these places popping up around the area now...I never once thought i'd get tired of eating burritos. But with the emergance of multiple places that basically star burritos in their menu. It's starting to look as if I may have to take a mexican break soon enough. I mean... this place is probably one of the better burritos i've had out of the many options available, but I guess by coming here I was hoping for a different experience, not just a different interior look to pretty much the same thing I see at all the other spots. meh..."}
{"text":"This ain't Taco Bell. For a couple of dollars more, you get fresh made Mex with a nice variety of options.  Located in a strip mall, it looks like a typical chain, but seems a bit more stylish.  The place was a bit busy, but the staff made sure that I was taken care of at all times.

I had the tacos, and was able to mix and match from a half dozen varieties.  The fillings were more homemade than any other competitive restaurant, and the Guacamole was especially nicely done.  All the menu items reminded me of the higher end Made in Mexico for fare that looks hand assembled and rustic, without the drive to Newmarket."}
{"text":"Tried this place a few days ago...it's not bad..but I found what I had a little on the bland side (the fish tacos - mahi mahi ones).  I got 2 for about $9.00.  They definitely overstuff the heck out of the tacos...so much so that I had to get all bougie and eat them with a fork and knife!  Luckily I asked to get some cilantro on them - it added some flavour.  I wish there was an element of heat in them...I think that would have definitely made them 10 times better.  The service was a bit off..but I think they are newly opened and working out the kinks.  Nothing too horrible but they seemed a tiny bit confused.  The person making my meal was really nice tho and even offered to bring utensils to my table.  For Mexican food I would probably drive up to Made in Mexico.  I might try this again and choose something else from the menu to see if perhaps my taste buds prefer something else."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place for awhile and last week I was finally able to try it out. I got the 3 tacos; beef, grilled chicken and fish. When I first saw the tortillas, I thought they would be very small but I was wrong. They might be small but it was loaded with toppings and they were fresh! The hot sauce is also tasty which is always a plus for me. After eating all 3 tacos, I was full and satisfied. The fish taco is amazing, I would definitely recommended. Overall the place was great, will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Advertised all you can eat tacos for $20 on front door, counter and website for months and when a group of my friends and I asked for it, we were told the special was over and they forgot to take down the signs. The owner was called and their story changed to having to be 19+ and ordering a beer to have the special; this is not advertised on any signs. This place either falsely advertises or hand picks who gets the ayce special without hassle depending on how they feel that night."}
{"text":"First time, and not my last. Food was all good. Everything freshly made. We started off with Natchos...... Delicious! We each ordered something different. I had the Fish Tacos which came with two sides, bean corn soup and Mexican fried rice. Staff very nice! The music had me moving on my seat. 
Great experience."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite and was surprised at how satisfied I was when leaving. Food was fresh and they had many choices of toppings of which no quantity was spared. I ordered the beef burrito and it came out weighty, tasty and satisfying. Toppings were fresh and the meat had great flavour. 

Service was above what I expected as the store is set up like a fast food joint but the staff brought the food to our tables. Servers were friendly and service was great. If you want to have a quick bite and get your money's worth, do try it out! 

Perfect balance of value, quality and service!"}
{"text":"Lunch Special at Gourmet Gringos Kitchen is definitely a good deal. Specialty Taco Combo for $10.95 includes 2 tacos, a huge bag of house made tortilla chips and a drink.

I love how my Baha Fish and Shrimp Tacos were both made when ordered. Toppings were both generous but I would just order 2 of those beer battered mahi mahi tacos instead of shrimp. Fish taco was surprisingly sizable and made a finger licking messy eat.

Food truck to a real restaurant and I think Gourmet Gringos Kitchen must be doing quite well. I remembered the first time I had their Mahi Mahi tacos at Nuit Blanche 2012 and they were amazing but the dine in fast food experience just feel so boring?! 

Still Gourmet Gringos Kitchen is probably one of the best option for tacos in the area. I will come back again for lunch."}
{"text":"We walked in it was ok not to busy,  not dead.  We sat down and we placed our order.  It took 25 mins to get apps,  we ordered crab cakes, but there was barely any crabs.  Than another 20 mins for mains, and those were ok. My friend ordered Baja fish tacos- the fish was to big for the tacos,  I decided on the chimichanga and it was filled with more rice.  Based on service this place is disappointing.  There were 8 employees so I'm not sure what happened.  Good was just ok,  nothing special to rave about. No chance of me coming back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I found plastic wrap in my nachos (not sure how that even got in there), a greasy film in my fountain pop, and my cheese fries were served cold. Disappointing to say the least.

UPDATE - No longer in business. Clearly myself and others were bang on on our reviews!!!  Glad to see the reviews work to not only promote the great businesses but shut down the awful ones to."}
{"text":"Most impressive!
We were looking for a quick bite and had been longing for a good Mexican place to eat in Aurora for some time. The place is fairly small and has a little but of a fast food setup... But do not be fooled...the food here is phenomenal!!!!
We were greeted by a friendly waitress and were seated immediately.  We learned that they had been open for less than a week but business was booming.  The owners Christian and Terry were there and introduced themselves and told us a little about the restaurant and their history. 
Now for the food....WOW...  The best fish tacos ever!!!!!  So yummy. Fresh, tasty, unbelievable.  We also dined on chorizo burritos and shrimp tacos.  They were so delicious....and boy are we stuffed. Great value.  I predict this place will become our \"go to place\" for great quality Mexican food close by. 
Now for the big question.  Would we go back?  Absolutely...just not tonight because we are so stuffed.  If you are in the area, highly recommended, you won't be disappointed. Great job Gourmet Gringos!  See you soon."}
