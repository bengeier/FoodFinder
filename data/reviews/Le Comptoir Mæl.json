{"text":"Update to my previous update which was right at opening time. The offerings have expanded greatly, with a focus on bowls and other well-portioned takeaway meals which you can order in advance (perfect for folks who work nearby). I have yet to try those but if you check out their facebook page you can see the details.  May be a small location but looks like Mael is already making a mark in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"The banh mi was delicious! I love the addition of kimchi in it. Already craving for another one. Great food! Great staff!"}
{"text":"Malheureusement il n'y a pas daikon dans leur sandwich et le pain n'est pas très frais mais il faut dire que je suis très capricieux. Ce n'est pas cher oui mais ça vaut ce que ça vaut. Du pain des carottes du concombre avec un peu de coriandre et une viande de base qualité."}
{"text":"The food is very reasonably priced. I ordered a very tasty grilled chicken 7\" (?) banh mi sandwich with Sriracha sauce on a fresh crusty roll and was really surprised that it was less than $5.   The staff is very friendly and no lineup.   Definitely making 'Le comptoir Mæl' one of my regular lunch time stops! Highly recommended. :)"}
{"text":"My friend brought me some sandwiches and salad from the Comptoir Mael, so I did not have the chance to see the place, but the food is extremely fresh and good. Everything is well seasoned, the bred is good and I was so impressed by the salad. It looked really simple with rice, meat (chicken and beef), corn, grated carrot and other veggies, but the with the soy sauce it was so nice, the taste was good and it was not too heavy. I recommend you the place, it is not expensive at all and if you are looking for healthy food it's a good option :)"}
