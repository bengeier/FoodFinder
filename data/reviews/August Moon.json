{"text":"As someone who's not a huge fan of Chinese food in general, I found this place to be just delicious. The Singapore noodles were pitch perfect; exactly what I was hopin for. The ginger beef was a delight, though the fortune cookie did inform me that I have AIDS. But that's not the restaurants fault. 

I'll definitely be going back, it delivered beyond expectations, and it's a good local joint."}
{"text":"Good, basic neighborhood Chinese food. Not gourmet, but very tasty. Large menu for variety."}
{"text":"Good food but will try to charge you extra to substitute for something that's cheaper. Doesn't make sense."}
{"text":"This place is a weird one.
ok so it is christmas eve and 5pm and order was placed and was told by a woman who has very bad broken english that it will be a 45 minute wait which was fine, she said it was very busy, well thats to be expected.
the order was very specific 2 meat eaters, and a vegetarian.
time past.....just like waiting for the jolly fat man, it never came. 
SO a quick phone call after 1 hour and 15 mintues i called only to be told that it was be here in 3-4 minues. OK i thought.
so 15 minutes later it arrived.

after the dishing up was done we sat to eat out xmas eve take out!

mid course, my sis the veggie, pulled out a lump of chicken in her plain veg chow main.

well a 30 year vegetarian, this did not sit well (no pun intended)

I called them and broken chinese lady said \"sorry it can happen, as it is really busy\".

Again i was not happy, i have now called alberta health, and will make sure this place is put in its place, an excuse like sorry its busy is not an excuse.

BUT the meat dishes were good."}
{"text":"Good food for a small neighborhood business. There can be some long wait times for the food and then the food may be sitting on the desk behind the counter for a while without a heat lamp."}
{"text":"I was craving western style Chinese food and found this place on a Saturday night. The veg filled egg rolls hit the spot. The chicken fried rice was very tasty and the broccoli chicken was good. I would return here when craving this kind of food. I ate all the leftovers the next day so it was reasonably economical taking that into account. I am not in a rush to return. It is a guilty indulgence."}
{"text":"Not crazy about the price here..super long wait for delivery.  It's chicken fried rice you could count the pieces. .lot of rice tho....."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst Chinese food ever! I can't believe they are even in business.  Ordered honey garlic ribs, there was no meat, only bones and fat.  I mean not even one rib was good.  The Egg rolls were so terrible, very little filling and so dry."}
{"text":"This food was surprisingly great! On par with some of the best ginger beef I've ever tasted.
I think this will end up our go to Chinese take out place."}
{"text":"The food looks good, but we can't put on finger on what is wrong with it.  My friend thinks they are cooking with rancid oil.  I think the rice is very old and stale.  The food has potential, but something is very \"off\".  Yuk.  Back to my old favorite in Queensland."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from August Moon for many years and will continue to do so as long as they're around. It's not often you find take-out/delivery only and I find the concept cool. They have great chicken fried rice and decent ginger beef, but my favorite dish is the honey garlic chicken. They can get quite busy so I find it's best to order as close to their open time of 4 as possible."}
{"text":"Solid little place. I usually get the wonton soup and a spring roll or two. Comes to a total of around $10.

Sometimes we get meals for our family, usually consisting of ginger beef and then a couple of random stuff. The ginger beef is pretty good, and the prices are average.

Probably wouldn't go out of my way, but if you're nearby this is a solid choice for Calgary Chinese food."}
