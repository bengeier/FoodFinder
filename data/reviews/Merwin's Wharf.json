{"text":"They have 2 awesome apps, however both I thought could be improved. The vegan nachos were great but I would have enjoyed more on regular tortillas. The soft pretzel is the best ive ever had, but the dipping sauces were just okay. The place is really cool though"}
{"text":"only had to wait 10 minutes for a table on Thursday night at 7:50pm.  Problem is we waited 50 minutes for food....2 salads and a chicken sandwich.  After waiting this long, we decided it was time to leave and go get dinner.   very disappointing"}
{"text":"The location is amazing. went for Sunday brunch after hearing how amazing it is. 2 if us sat at the empty bar for over 5 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. The bartender was nice, and expressed excitement that she actually had people at the bar, but with NO ONE ELSE AT THE BAR, was less than attentive.  We had to ask another employee for silverware. Ordered a bloody mary, which was good, but HUGE.....a meal in its self.   I ordered a double shot in it, which ended up making this a $20 bloody Mary, which was litetally almost all tomatoe juice....my own fault for not asking prices...but $20 worth of effin cucumber vodka and tomatoes juice was not impressive. The food was mediocre at best.  The scrambled eggs were in a huge chaffing pan in a loaf, that had to be sliced into portions, GROSS....blintzes were all stuck together and falling apart.  The stuffed green peppers were very good. There were approximately 8 choices in the buffet, for $18. Absolutely nothing was impressive.  The pastries seemed to be from GFS...Definitely not made in house.  After not finishing our plates of food, and only 1 trip up to the food,  we asked for our bill. At no point did the bartender ask if we liked the food or the drinks. Really just very disappointing.  I would try again, but only for happy hour and only because of the amazing location.  Will not suggest this spot for brunch with all of the amazing places in Cleveland."}
{"text":"NO BISCUIT FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!!! Visited on 11/3/14, party of 2, it was about 11:30 am, brunch was had.  I ordered The Standard Breakfast and my friend had Biscuits and  Gravy.  The room is very nice, the outdoor patio is nice as well but it was too cold on this day to sit outside.    The Standard Breakfast consisted of scrambled eggs (eggs are done any style) with sausage, bacon and I had the Black Bean and Sweet Potato Hash.  Aside from some of the hash being undercooked, it was good.  My friend was satisfied with her Gravy & Biscuits.  I looked on the menu for toast or biscuits as a side, but, nothing was listed.  I asked the server if I could purchase toast or a biscuit and she frowned, said no, but said she would ask.  She returned shaking her head, \"no, I'm sorry, we don't have a toaster (?) and all of the biscuits are allocated for the day.\"  I asked her how they know how many biscuits they are going to need for the day.  She didn't really answer.  I was thinking to myself that customer service would probably dictate that you take care of the customer who is in front of you at that moment.  If they run out of biscuits at the end of the day, then you just inform customers, \"sorry, we are out of biscuits.\"  But to tell a customer NO who is right there in front of you - was really wrong, my opinion only.   And whoever heard of a restaurant with no toaster?  Seriously.    The manager (he looked like the manager but did not introduce himself as such) came over after we were done eating and asked how everything was.  We said everything was good (which it was).  I mentioned to him that I had asked for toast or a biscuit to accompany my dish and he said, \"well, we're still working out the kinks\" which didn't make any sense at all.  Cleveland is a food town, first impressions are everything.  YELP! has lots of semi-negative reviews for this place.  I swear the \"we're working out the kinks\" reply has been noted in previous reviews in this forum.  The competition for patrons has to be fierce, negative reviews don't help...there are plenty of other places to eat."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night after a long week of work & frankly I was tired and not really in the mood to go out........well, that quickly changed once we arrived at The Wharf.  What a location!  And the Metroparks really did a nice job with the layout of the restaurant and the patio with two fire pits/places.  We got drinks on the patio while we watched the crew sculls go by and then a big o'll freighter too!  Fun to watch.   Our friend ordered food which looked pretty good - the chorizo fries were ok - and he seemed to like his sandwich.  Server was pretty nice but she had a limited idea of what the bar offered. We will definitely be back soon!  My girlfriend had the great idea that the next time my brother & his family visit us from the faaaaar East side they would love this place, especially my niece & nephew.  The Metroparks just keep getting better!"}
{"text":"Great place, great addition to cleveland, need to get service end straightened out , very poor"}
{"text":"Food was terrible. Cheeseburger was really bad. How do you mess up a cheeseburger?!?!?  Ribs..... Cold and they basically prepared them by putting them in a microwave then putting some sauce on them. We brought out dog who then ate very well. So the food is good enough for a dog. Service was good!!! Waitress was very nice!"}
{"text":"I can't believe how terrible the service is here. I want so bad for this to succeed because it's a fabulous building and location and has a great patio and of course I love the Metroparks. But I've had 2 absolutely horrible experiences and I'll never go back. The first time I went was right after it opened last year. The hostess and the bartender were downright rude and the service was really slow. I figured I would give it one more chance this past weekend and now I know I'll never go back. We were told an hour to get a table. It was 2 hours before we were sitting and another hour before we got food, and it was less crowded than many other bars/restaurants in the area typically are on a Saturday. Getting a beer at the bar was very slow and bartenders completely ignored customers who were trying to order beers. The hostess and the waitress were extremely unprofessional. When this place does close, someone else will buy it in a heartbeat and manage it better and will make it into an extremely successful business. If the Metroparks don't get it together, that's gonna happen sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"I'm only giving the place a 2 because it looked nice inside and had a sweet view on the river. First drink order, including our waters, took over 15 minutes to come to us, and we weren't even given the opportunity to order yet. All the food was just so-so, my chicken sandwich was simply a decent sized grilled chicken breast, on a sheetz-style pretzel bun, with Frank's Red Hot splashed on it, and a bland 'blue cheese' sauce. The menu overall was tiny, prices looked reasonable but not for the portions of quality of the food, and when we had to pay the checks, it took our waitresses 5 trips to the table and an additional 45 minutes or so before we could close out."}
{"text":"Delish!! My mom and I came here for a nice relaxing dinner. We loved it!! The food was amazing as was our service (Patti was awesome!) we had a caprese salad, chicken cesar wrap and the grilled cheese! All awesome!"}
{"text":"I can't believe the metroparks serve such delicious food.  The soft pretzel appetizer is as thick as my arm and about twice the size of my head. It's crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and comes with three dipping sauces. Best shared with a group of four. The fish tacos are amazing: the ingredients taste so fresh and flavorful. The view of the river is beautiful and the staff are very friendly. Totally worth a try!"}
{"text":"Great views from the deck at the bend of the Cuyahoga river in the flats.  Food was good and portions were fairly generous but the menu is uninspired.  Service was slow at 6:30pm but as the crowd thinned out it improved somewhat. Unless you just want a drink at the bar, make a reservation for dinner.  I had the catfish and my wife had the salmon and both were tasty.  Beer selection is good and cocktails were well made.  Prices are high for the quality."}
{"text":"Here's the math:   +7 stars for scenery&ambience -5 stars for the poop on a stick quality of food  It's a non profit so whatevs. Just go for drinks and hanging out in cool spot. But stay away from the poops on sticks."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Waitresses had no clue what they were doing. Food was sub par. Limited menu. Not going back again. Good luck finding the place with all the closed roads/detours."}
{"text":"Although the establishment is nice and the view is lovely the brunch food was subpar and our service was awful. How is the service slow when we are serving ourselves from the buffet???"}
{"text":"Great food, great view, and awesome location and they have corn hole, Connect four and Jenga."}
{"text":"I like this place. The parking is good. The view is good. The drinks were good. The food was good (not great) but I wasn't expecting great. It is a nice place to stop and have a sandwich and have a cold beer on an afternoon. We started with the heirloom tomato salad. It was colorful and flavorful. I had a BBQ chicken sandwich and fries -- both were good and had lots of flavor. My wife had the same.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Merwin's Wharf has become our favorite Sunday brunch spot in Cleveland. Between 11am and 2pm, they serve an open buffet with American diner classics such ad scrambled eggs, bacons, pancakes, breakfast lasagna, etc. Service is great and waitresses are very polite and friendly. With bottomless coffee, we paid 21$/person (+tax). Tables are not too packed and there's no loud music which makes conversation possible and enjoyable. The view is awesome not just in summer but in fall and winter, too! It also feels great to support Cleveland Metro Parks by just going there!"}
{"text":"Horrible. We waited over an hour to be seated and another 20-25 minutes to be helped. THEN, we were told that some menu items were unavailable, like the pretzel... Which is the #1 selling appetizer. HOW DO YOU RUN OUT OF DOUGH that can more than likely be easily made. Ordered the Ribs for dinner and they were, well, gross to put the nicely. Waitress was not attentive and the restaurant was more than half empty. No idea who would want to drink OR dine here. Buyer beware! shame on the metro parks for not doing a better job!"}
{"text":"Jennifer T. nailed this review.  Read hers.   They are working out the bugs on the food and service.  Give it a few more months. The setting and facility is great and deserves a 4-5 star rating.  Forget eating there for now."}
{"text":"The food is exceptional. Chef Nick Lanzo is creative and such a nice guy as well. Our server, Katie, was such a sweetheart and was attentive without being overbearing. She made good suggestions and never let our waters become empty. We have always had good meals and service here and plan to come back as much as possible. It's a hidden gem on the river! Can't wait for the summer and their new menu starting in May! And their patio will be my favorite hot spot come warmer weather!"}
{"text":"The food was ok but from the moment we entered the hostess, manager and sever were all rude. It was over 90 degrees out and they had no inside tables which the hostess failed to mention till after she offered us inside or out. Once outside since it was our only choice there were no umbrellas due to the faintest breeze. When we asked to please get an umbrella the manager said no, because it might blow over the table. Terrible terrible customer service."}
{"text":"This place is nice if you have nothing to do that day. Service is super slow, and employees kind of give you that look like you're bothering them.  Our food order was messed up, and drinks were never refilled.   For a few years open you would think they would be a little more on their toes. Scenery is beautiful, but I wouldn't come here again to eat."}
{"text":"I would like to give five stars for the venue, Four stars for the service, zero stars for the food, this is the second time I've been there and  My pot roast would have been better if I ate at a soup kitchen my two guests agreed with me"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday afternoon and loved it!  The location was great to sit & watch the boats on the river, the food was delicious and all the staff was fantastic.  An enjoyable time - especially at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The kind of place you go for the location and atmosphere and NOT for the food or service.  First off the wait staff's average age is probably 60, and they are slow as molasses.  Forget about getting a refill on your drink, extra napkins or even silverware (I ended up getting my own, silverware is located in a nook to the right of the bar)  We ordered the jumbo pretzel, which came with beer cheese and mustard.  The pretzel itself was delicious and was jumbo.  The beer cheese and mustard was delicious, but way too little of it. You get enough for about 1/2 of the pretzel.  We then ordered 2 hamburgers, which were frozen concession stand type burgers, nothing special.  The Merwin Ave sandwich, which was probably the best hing we ordered, the veggie wrap which was blah and an apple bacon grilled cheese, which again as blah.  If Merwin's Wharf wasn't located where it is, or if it was a crappy day and we couldn't eat or walk outside and all this rating was based in was the food - I would definitely rate it a 1 , but because of location I give it a 3!!!"}
{"text":"Worlds smallest mussels, half of the shells empty. Perch with no flavor. Hard dry chicken in the salad. No repeat visit to this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Great view, however inexperienced and overworked staff. It took 30 minutes to even be recognized then took forever to get our food. I ordered the fiesta burger and my wife ordered the bbq chicken sandwich. My burger was ordered medium and came out completely overcooked and hard to swallow not to mention that it tasted like cardboard. The toppings were good but was overshadowed by the horribly cooked burger. My wife's chicken sandwich was tasteless, overcooked and dry as well. The slaw was good but nothing to write home about. Overall this place has potential, given better cooks and wait staff. Definitely not worth the drive from Berea. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Last time I was here with a group of friends in the summer. We sat outside and had drinks (no food) and enjoyed the atmosphere, which is still a 4 star rating. However after eating lunch there today, those 4 stars were quickly reduced to 3 based on the food.  It was a little colder this time around so we sat inside, the inside was beautifully decorated with Christmas decorations and the scenery still amazing.   I ordered the black bean burger ($10) with cheese ($1). The brioche bun was fresh and chewy and the basil aioli had great flavor, but other than that it just wasn't that good. The patty itself had a pasty consistency to it and lacked real flavor. Morning Star black bean burgers are a million times better tasting (and cheaper). I added a side salad (extra $2) with the artichoke balsamic vinaigrette. The salad was an average salad with tomato, lettuce, croutons, carrots and cucumbers...small and uneventful. The dressing was pretty good though.  My boyfriend had a Caesar salad ($9) with chicken breast (extra $5). It was a head of Romaine lettuce cut in half with parmesean cheese and Caesar dressing drizzled on top. He really liked the dressing but said the chicken although had good flavor was too dry. The salad was served on a small plate which made it very difficult to cut the large wedges of salad without it falling off your plate. This definitely was not a $14 salad.  Overall the server was friendly, service okay, food overpriced but not overly flavorful. I still love the location of this place and will come back, but most likely only for drinks and maybe appetizers on the patio when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Good Ohio focused micro brew selection, and generous happy hour tasting menu. Plus you cannot beat being down on the Cuyahoga!"}
{"text":"We had such a great dining experience here. First off, our waiter Liam was fantastic. We told him it was our 5th wedding anniversary and he immediately offered to take for pictures for us, even directing us to the best spots. He was so kind and helpful throughout our meal! The manager also came over to wish us a happy anniversary. I ordered the seared walleye and my husband ordered a half rack of ribs. I savored every bite off my plate! It had a perfect crisp on the outside and still flaky and tender on the inside. The sauce was divine and the veggies were the perfect addition. My husband loved his meal too. We can't wait to go back in warmer weather to enjoy the outdoor seating.  We were also glad to support the Metroparks!"}
{"text":"Come in and relax and enjoy a good burger are some delicious nachos. Something for everyone- sit and watch the boats go by or grab a draft and play giant Jenga next to the river.  Nice relaxed atmosphere for kids and dogs (on the patio of course!)."}
{"text":"St. Paddy's Day was a HOT MESS.  Even though the $1 buffet was advertised until 11:00, we were turned away at 10:20.  The bartender looked like he could kill us for ordering THREE Bloody Mary's.  Very disappointed that they didn't have their original BM's, only a cheap mixed version was available.  The Manager doesn't seem to 'manage' very well.  It was chaotic and wasn't that busy.  I don't know what they would do if they really had a crowd.  The outside was empty so we had the fireplace to ourselves, which was nice."}
{"text":"One word...BRUNCH!  Wow! I am in love with their brunch! About 6 of my friends and I came for brunch on a Sunday. I always love eating in large groups because my friends share their food and we can all try a bunch of dishes.  We ended up ordering a smorgasbord board of items! To start if you love Bloody Mary's this is your place (check out the photo)! The recommended one is \"The Merwin's Mary\" it's a charcuterie board in your drink! I ordered the Espresso Martini and it was delicious! The coffee flavor did not over power my palate and take away from the taste of my food. A few of my gal pals ordered the Hot Chocolate and said that it was delicious as well.  The food...The Food was fantastic! No one had any complaints and that is what makes a fantastic brunch spot! We ordered the Oatmeal Cookie Pancakes, The Egg Sandwich (that has the best crispy pork belly on it), Chorizo Hash (served in a cast iron skillet) and the Creme Brulee French Toast. An ordering tip: If you like sweet potatoes get the sweet potato and black bean hash- you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"After 2 years, still the worst service in Cleveland. Tarnishes the image of Metroparks. But still, nice to be on the river."}
{"text":"From out of state but have been here twice.  Both times we sat on the patio in the blazing sun but that didn't deter us.  Great view of the activity on the river including seeing a large barge make the tight curve under the bridge.  Our kids dropped their kayaks at this location and oared to Edgewater Park along Lake Erie.  Food is good....nice selection of beers. I happen to like their grilled peach and feta sandwich while hubby had the apple bacon grilled cheese sandwich.  Others in our party had the southwest poblano skillet (it does have a kick to it) and the black bean burger (heavy on the beans).  Young boys had kid's mac n cheese but no healthy sides to go with it.  Asked for fresh fruit or veggies....only choice was french fries.   Suggest chef comes up with some healthy options for the little diners....applesauce, carrot sticks w dip, etc."}
{"text":"The food was decent and the service was terrible. Had to chase waitress to get refills and our bill. The only thing tat made this nice evening was the view of the river"}
{"text":"Absolutely Beautiful patio! The Metroparks has done a stellar job with this location. From fabulous food and drinks to and outdoor patio with life sized Jenga and corn hole to fire pits. With a beautiful view of the river the atmosphere is a 10.  While I cannot say enough about the location lets get to the libations. While a little on the pricier side the bloody mary was top notch and the mimoa's were just as delicious. If you are a fan of Bloodies this not one to miss, topped with olives, salami, cheese, and much more this packs a bit of a kick.  Our server was out of this world and super attentive. He offered to take a group photo of us and made sure that we were well taken care of from start to finish. I opted for the egg sandwich and while messy was absolutely delicious, and the side of braised pork belly was tender.  This is one establishment that brings food and the outdoors of Cleveland to the forefront."}
{"text":"Yesterday was our second time since they opened.  The location is great...however the service both times was very slow with the servers not really knowing the menu well nor what was available.   In addition they were out of very basic items like pickles and Cole slaw which is one of their specialities.   This is a great place to have a drink and food at the bar but there are much better places for good food so close to Tremont."}
{"text":"The challenge with this place is the location as due to Cleveland's brilliance in choosing a time and a place for road construction, driving to this location can cause road rage. But let me tell you, the concept here is great! This place has a huge parking lot, so parking will not be an issue. They also have a large boardwalk with boat docs, similar to Shooter's minus the fear of being shanked. I have to say that I feel that some of the instances where others have documented horrible food reviews may have in fact been attributed to the restaurant just opening up and that is really no excuse. But every restaurant is going to have growing pains. Also, our group of 4 had some of the better burgers, and calamari that we've had in a long time. The drinks were reasonably priced too.   Now the main attention getter here is the fact that you're sitting on the water. For those of you homers that think Cleveland is the greatest place in the world (relax, I'm with you on this one) I was so excited to see this sort of restaurant open on the river. It's what Cleveland needs. For those of you that live her by default i.e., boyfriend, lover, school, work, etc. give this place a shot. It's pretty cool"}
{"text":"Dined there on a beautiful Friday evening.  Upon arriving we were seated immediately on the outside patio.  Our server Andrea was very attentive.  The food coming out of the kitchen was outstanding.  Executive chef Nick Lanzo is an up and coming star on the Cleveland food scene.  A great time was had by all and we will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Overall this is a really good restaurant and location, but appears to still be working out some kinks.   Food/ menu/ bar - The menu is pretty simple but is more than sufficient for the setting on the river in the flats, and frankly anything more complex would likely exceed their current capabilities. We had a regular burger, a fiesta burger, a black bean (veggie) burger and the Lake Erie (walleye) tacos. Each of us really liked the quality of food (fresh vegetables, gourmet breads for the buns, everything cooked precisely as ordered). Chips as the side were homemade, fresh and crispy - not the best or most flavorful homemade chips you will find but a very solid effort. Two of our plates came out  missing a few of the appropriate toppings, but our waitress identified the issue before we did and promptly fixed it. Minor infraction, happens everywhere, and I attribute this more to the management / startup issues (see below) than the food quality. The bar was well stocked, had a decent (not great, but pretty respectable) selection of micro brews and draughts. Overall, the food was a solid four stars, maybe four and a half. Prices were reasonable and very fair for the food quality and restaurant location. Beer prices seemed a touch on the high side for the type of restaurant, but not significantly so. Whoever is running the kitchen (and to some extent the bar) understands this restaurant's identity and is executing the plan very nicely.  Venue/ location - If you're looking for a rustic, authentic Cleveland venue, with a nice view and close proximity to downtown, ohio city and tremont, this is it. The riverside patio with small boardwalk is awesome, and the general location is very convenient to the rest of the city.  I can't in good conscience give the location five stars (it sits a stone's throw from at least three strip clubs and is surrounded by heavy, partially abandoned,  industry). Given that it sits on a scenic bend in the river and all of the windows and the patio face the river rather than the badlands that lie behind it, the location is a solid four stars. But if you attempt to walk there from Ohio City, just be prepared to really immerse   yourself in a true flats experience.   Management / service/ startup issues -  The hostess was probably the worst part of our night at Merwin's Wharf. She was looking down at her phone as we walked up and until we prompted her while standing right in front of her. Not a good start. Without looking at anything (no list check, no glance around the restaurant), she informed us it would be a 1/2 hour to 45 minute wait. We did not mind grabbing a beer at the bar and taking in the sunset, so we opted to wait. When we got to the bar we quickly noticed that no one else appeared to be waiting for tables, and at least three prime tables were open on the patio and had already been cleaned by the bus staff. We inquired with the bar tender whether we could take one of the open tables. He seemed confused why we were still waiting but told us the hostess would have to make that call. The bar was nice enough that we decided to just order food there, and as we did our buzzer went off (about 10 minutes after we got there, not 30-45). The hostess sat us at an inside table, told us none of the patio tables were available. We the watched her walk outside to notice how many tables were still open, but she just shrugged off the error and did not offer us a patio table (those patio tables remained open for the next 30 mins or so). As we went to cash out our bar tab to transfer to our table, the manager swooped onto the bar tender's computer and decided he needed to do a bunch of things at that moment (several other stations were open), so we stood waiting for our tiny bar tab for another ten minutes while the manager finished up his tasks. After we wrapped up at the and bar finally got to our table, the confusion continued. We had two waitresses that night. The first seemed very new and lost, but pleasant. She was quickly replaced by another waitress who seemed to have a good amount of restaurant experience and was very helpful and efficient. No less than 6 plates were smashed on the floor during the hour we were there. This appeared to be the result of a poor plate stacking location choice - placing tall stacks of plates on an exposed shelf between the kitchen window and the busy pathway that connects the bar, kitchen and server stations. I get that accidents happen and the plate smashing did not bother us much. But this seems like something a restaurant manager would only need to see once before relocating the plate stacks. Overall it appeared that the restaurant manager & hostess situations were generating the biggest issues we had with this restaurant. This category gets a one star, but could be improved very easily and quickly."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the brunch buffet. Def not worth the $18. French toast out of a box and frozen sausage patties. Bacon was good, but that was really the only thing. Server accused me of lying about my daughter only being 12 so that she could get the child's price."}
{"text":"Maybe we were there on a good day but no complaints here!  As others have wrote the setting is amazing!  Beautiful by the river!  It's about time someone built a restaurant all can enjoy while also enjoying the beautiful water we have here in Cleveland!  We were a group of 5 that shared the fried green tomatoes, the BIG pretzel and the vega-nachos.  All were good...the vega-nachos were probably my favorite.  Homemade tortilla chips that melted in your mouth and the black bean hummus and guacamole was also very fresh and good.  The cheese fondue that comes with the BIG pretzel is delicious!  Tomatoes were beautifully presented but the flavor was a bit underwhelming compared to others I have had.  Must compliment the bloody mary I had made with cucumber vodka...very good but a bit pricey at $12; hence, my 4-star rating.  Granted it was a large bloody mary but still expensive.  I shared the apple, bacon grilled cheese with one of the other people in the party because I was pretty full after the appetizers.  We thought it was very good!  Comes with handmade chips that were just so-so...not much flavor.  One person had the open face peach and feta sandwich and she really enjoyed it.  Another tried one of the specials, a Cuban sandwich piled high with meat on a nice bun.  He really enjoyed it but commented that the coleslaw was nothing to write home about.  The last person in our party just had a mixed salad but he did comment that the tomato in the salad tasted \"garden fresh\" and not from a store.  All-in-all we had a really nice time...had very good service...but we are never in a hurry when we go out to eat.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times hoping it will get better. Today it was A multitude of issues: - cash registers had a \"glitch\" - ran out of ice - couldn't extend or tilt table shades due to their delicate nature (despite direct sun and high temps) - 45 min wait for the table and an additional hour for the good  All this and nary a manager in sight. Pretty lack luster for a location that is dependent on people deciding to come here since there's no foot traffic. Not coming back at all."}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  Brunch wasn't your normal eggs, pancakes and waffles.  Turkey potpie, coconut chicken, etc all added to the experience.  The view of the river is very nice, even on a blustery fall day."}
{"text":"Went on Goodtime 3. We saw this place from our tour. A Lady we sat by recommended us to go here. She had been a few weeks before.   Beautiful summer afternoon. The place was slammed. We waited about 20 mins or so. Not bad. We sat on deck. Games are available to play like corn hole and giant jenga.   We got the pretzel for an appetizer big hit. It was good. Huge. A meal. For the 5 of us. A nice bite. Got the nachos appetizer for my lunch. It was just ok. Not enough toppings. Fish tacos were good. Burger good. The peach sandwich ok. We got ripped on the number of chips we got. We complained and the server brought us more.  Overall we had a good time. Meal was ok. View was awesome. People watching great! Cold drinks on a very hot day great. Service good.   I'd go back. Overall it was fun and food was ok."}
{"text":"I had been waiting to check it out.  So, Friday night I stop after work on the way home.  Had to research how to get there, or you can call.  The property was beautiful like most Metro Park sites are.  The bar maid Nema was very welcoming.  Started with the Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale, yum.  Then had a caprize salad, it was good. Then had a pear martini to top off my experience.  First Class.  You have got to visit this gem of a place, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently ate here before an Indians game.  I was sad to know that they discontinued the Goat cheese mac.  They did try to recreate it and it was great!  The only downside to this is that they charged me to make it and didnt tell me and also charged to drink soda water.  I have never been charged for soda water at any restaurant so this was new to me (is this normal?), even those on east 4th or in Tremont.  Probably not going back since that mac was changed and that was my go-to but I do love their location!"}
{"text":"I would probably rate this a 3.5 if that was an option. The scenery is wonderful. Everything is obviously very clean and contemporary since it is a new building. We sat at the bar and ordered the fiesta burger and a Cleveland lemonade. The burger was good, but I was hoping it had more flavor and pop to it. The Cleveland lemonade was a little too strong for 2 in the afternoon, but the bartender did offer to fix the drink for me. Overall this is a nice place to go to, just not as much wow factor as I was expecting."}
{"text":"Santa Brunch at Merwins was great. Very organized with activities for the kids. Santa was good - walked around and visited tables as well as sitting for pictures. Face painter, balloon guy, magic show and crafts were all good activities. Great assortment of food choices - couple of dishes could have been warmer my only reason for not giving a 5 Star. I would definitely come back with my family"}
{"text":"We love to visit Merwin's on nice summer days. With this last visit, service was pretty slow and food took a while. Everything was still delicious as always, though. Will definitely be back as always."}
{"text":"The first time we came here was right after they opened last year. We waited an hour to be seated despite there being multiple empty tables. They said they didn't want to overwhelm the kitchen. I get that - I worked in food service for years. Once we were finally seated the service was okay, not stellar, but it was okay. We placed our orders - I had a chicken sandwich which was pretty good and my husband ordered a burger, medium rare. Neither my husband or myself has ever sent food back but his burger came out WELL done. The second burger they sent out was fine.   We decided to give the place a try again since they have been around about a year now - figured they would have worked out some kinks. Our experience started off positively. The waitress was friendly and we were seated right away. I ordered a chicken caesar wrap and a side salad - all good but the salad was really small. My husband decided to try the burger again and this time ordered it rare. It came out mid-well to well done. I told him to send it back. The second burger they sent came out CHARRED, so when the waitress asked how it was we told her but kindly said it was okay, it wasn't her fault, and she didn't have to do anything. She sent the manager over who offered to send another burger but at that point we were over it. She took the burger off our bill which was nice but I would certainly hope they would after all that. So while I sat eating my meal, the waitress proceeded to ignore us and the fact that my husband was now sitting there with an empty water and an empty beer. She brought us our check and hastily said \"no rush\" then realized my husband had nothing to drink and asked if he wanted another beer. Again, we were over it by that point and just wanted to leave. She picked up our check, brought it back and said \"thank you\" and left abruptly as if she couldn't wait for us to leave.   We were as nice as we could be and stated multiple times it was not the waitress's fault. The food experience was bad enough but to top it off with a rude waitress who made us feel like it was our fault was the icing on the cake. Will not be going back again and do not recommend."}
{"text":"I had been here awhile ago for brunch before it turned into buffet only and loved the awesome location on the river and while the service was a bit slow the food was great including some of the best cheesy grits I've had in the city.  On a beautiful summer Saturday after boating on the river, a few of us decided to stop by to have a few drinks and hang out on their gorgeous patio.  By luck, we wandered in on a night they had a live band play on the park like setting next to the restaurant.  This place was well thought out and had a seperate outside bar and bathroom for such events.  Well done Metroparks."}
{"text":"At first the lack of organization at the front desk had me second guessing coming here and the 10 min wait just to get a water had me 30 seconds from leaving but the food was amazing and the scenery was worth the hurdles. I would recommend people of Cleveland to come here and support this new local landmark on the Cuyahoga!"}
{"text":"Beautiful space and area. Not a single table umbrella on the patio which I disliked but maybe that's just me. Our party of 6 was seated on the patio around 2pm on a Saturday and was then left to sit there with no attention from a server. Not even an acknowledgement of \"busy be right with you\". After 15 minutes with no one even taking our drink order we decided to take our business elsewhere. Overall disappointing, not sure if/when we will try again."}
{"text":"The food was awesome!  The views were even better!  They have some cool adult/kid games while you wait for your food.  Always interesting to see what is coming down the river.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This review is based on three visits to Merwin's Wharf since it opened about two years ago.  The first time we were there, which was just after they opened, the food was just so-so with decent service.  We all ordered sandwiches and they were good, but nothing to write home about and the servers seemed a little unorganized.  We gave them another try a few months later and things improved quite a bit.  Our dinners were good and the service was definitely improved.  Our last visit was on a beautiful day so we were able to sit on the extensive patio overlooking the river.  The food and service was good but the view really made the day!  There is also a large, free parking lot which is certainly a plus in The Flats."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews but I felt I had to pass this along... I should have read the other reviews before agreeing to eat here.  I went with a large group so when they gave us a 2 hour wait time I was understanding.  We sat outside on their very nice patio and things looked promising.  That's about it though...  We ordered several appetizers.  When one of my friends picked up his order at the bar and he walked it out to his wife and she told him it was the wrong item we both returned it to the bar to get it resolved.  The bartender  took the order back and put back into the kitchen and before I knew it, it was being resold to a different customer.  I could not believe my eyes.  We should have left at that point but for some reason we didn't.    We finally got our table 2 hours and 15 minutes later, which was understandable.  I will even mention that I met the chef when the table was being set and he wanted to thank us for waiting and he said once we sit down, he would send out a free appetizer.  I thought things were looking up.  Crazy though... They sent out a huge pretzel, which ironically was the dish we brought back and was resold, and between 12 people, we didn't finish it because it was not very good.  After trying to figure out what I wanted off of their limited menu, I ended up with a chicken sandwich which was so so.   Service overall was slow and not attentive and management didn't seem to be in it to win it.    I will not be returning and would steer people clear of this place.  The metro parks are not ready to enter the restaurant business and they should stick to what they know, parks.  Good luck if you ignore this warning."}
{"text":"I think it is a great idea that the Metroparks owns this restaurant in that is right on the river!  You have to get the Merwin's Avenue sandwich when here!  On Wednesdays they have a band that plays on the patio from 9 to 7 PM.  If you're looking to head into the flats after lunch there is a water taxi up right outside of the restaurant near the boardwalk. All in all this is a great restaurant and location."}
{"text":"Hosted our corporate event this evening. Top notch food and extremely friendly service. We are planning a return for our next event!"}
{"text":"Very pleasant early dinner on the banks of the Cuyahoga River. Enjoying the sun while having a beer or two.   Friendly staff. Beautiful view. Food okay but nota five star. Burger great. Fish tacos used a flacked fish - no a piece of fish????  Fun place good drinks food okay."}
{"text":"We had the Cuban sandwich and previously chicken ceasar wrap. Both were very good. It's a great view of Cuyahoga river and nice atmosphere. Great service"}
{"text":"We decided to stop into this this restaurant today at about 11:30am, and our waitress was Liza and she was so attentive to our every whim. We ordered the standard hamburgers, homemade potato chips and garden salad, food was cooked perfectly and the salads were perfect too. Out of all the restaurants that we have ever ordered hamburgers, Merwin's Wharf cooked them the best, perfect and juicy. This restaurant is beautiful, cozy and inviting. All the staff were friendly, than the waitress went outside to start a fire in their pit and it was so inviting too, so cozy. They also have lots of parking, and to look out at the lake was beautiful too. When the warm weather comes this is going to be our come to place to hang out and relax with friends & family. We gave it a 10+, because we did feel welcomed as soon as we walked in the door. Brian the manager came over to see if everything was ok, now how many managers do this, not many."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and had a fabulous experience.  The service was great, the food was very good and the ambiance was spectacular.  This is truly a hidden gem for Cleveland.  Sitting on the patio made you feel like you were on vacation and watching the Nautica Queen go by while having our drinks.  This is a definite \"return to\" place!!!"}
{"text":"Nice food selections, good service. However, the caprese salad was disappointing:  both the mozarella and tomatoes were chopped into big chunks instead of sliced and there was no fresh basil.  Other than that the place is great."}
{"text":"Awesome location, building, amenities and idea. But the service is very bad... Seems like they have never worked in the industry. Everyone seems so scattered brained and lost. Had a reservation at 8:15 did not get seated until almost 9pm. 20 min for drinks, then another 20 min to take our order. Food was very bad compared to most regular old bars. They need to keep it simple. Take notes from Hooples across the river who does simple good bar food... I really hope the Metro Parks figure this out because the place could be a real awesome place. But Right now Ill only be back for the location every once in a while."}
{"text":"I was extremely underwhelmed.  I've been several times, to eat and to drink.  The prices are high, the portions are not large, and the food is merely acceptable.  The crowd is kind of yuppy so I'm guessing the place mostly caters to the boat-owner types that won't think twice about dropping twelve bucks on a sandwich or a burger.  For me however, I did not feel that the food was a good value.  On the plus side, the restaurant was very clean, the decor nice, and the service was good.  The patio is nice also.  The main advantage of this place to me, and the main reason I'm giving it three stars instead of two, is because it's accessible from the water.  I was able to paddle up in a kayak, pull up to their dock, and carry it up to shore and go to the restaurant.  So I give this restaurant 2* plus 1* for location.  It's a convenient place to stop sometimes if you're paddling on the river and get hungry or thirsty."}
{"text":"3 stars, although I'm not sure I can form a solid opinion about this place quite yet. It's in walking distance of my apartment, which is great because I read a lot of reviews about it being hard to locate due to closed bridges, etc. So, I cannot speak to that. The building itself is really nice-- lots of seating, great open atmosphere and a good sized bar. The out door seating is superb-- again good size, great view of the river and city skyline, comfy couches and cozy fire pits.   My major complaint is that they do not take reservations unless you call in advance and have a larger party. I make a point to make reservations well in advance anywhere I eat because I know how crowded Cleveland restaurants get on the weekends and I do not like to wait. Upon arriving, the hostess let us know that it was an hour wait inside and 2 hours for the patio. Huge bummer because it was around 8pm on a Friday and I was STARVING.   On the plus side, we found a seat on one of the outside couches and were able to be served from there. We had the chicken wings, which were mediocre and seemed like they needed to be cooked a little bit longer. My boyfriend had the fish tacos, which were decent ( he let me have a bit) but a little watery and needed a bit more flavor. I had  the perch sliders which were pretty darn good and something I would definitely get on my next visit.   Overall, fairly good experience for a brand new establishment. But, I do think the place has potential to do better in due time, hence the 3 stars. The staff was nice even thought I think they are still trying to get the hang of things. I doubt I will be going back on a weekend until they take reservations. Major kudos to the Metroparks for utilizing this building and the space so well!"}
{"text":"So much promise here!!! The location and patio are perhaps the best in the city but the food and service has been hit or miss. I really hope they pull it together as it could quickly become one of my favorite spots. The Poutine is solid and great to share."}
{"text":"Really a nice place the metro parks has done a great job.  If they can duplicate it on there other properties they will dominate the restaurant business in public places. Great employees especially Mary. real restaurant people."}
{"text":"Great for the kids- giant Jenga, right on the river with plenty of boats rolling by and trains up on the bridges. Food was ... Eh, ok."}
{"text":"First time I was here I thought the food was very average- had the vegan nachos. The guacamole on the nachos was very bland but the black bean hummus was good in the pita chips they used were really delicious and freshly baked. The fish tacos were ok, I felt like they needed some type of sauce. Tried a few different things the second time and really liked my food! We had the pretzel and the mac & cheese. Both were really delicious. The pretzel was large enough for at least four people. This place has a really nice view and a huge patio with at least two fireplaces. The staff is friendly also!"}
{"text":"I liked this place mostly for the music (great classic rock favorites), ambiance and a blueberry barbecue sauce I still can't get out of my mind. If you sit on the patio you're almost right next to the river and get great views of the city and glimpses of the lake. The dining area is very spread out (large tables great for groups) and our server seemed to have a huge section to cover which affected the speed of service and attentiveness for refills. Everyone was very nice and the food was good - I'd definitely go back. Ask for the draft beer where some of the proceeds go back to the Metroparks!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give a disclaimer about my review. They have special tasting nights where they are closed to the public and you pay a set price for a 3 course meal with drink pairings. The meal is not on the menu and when I was here there were about 4 tables of patrons with 3 or less in the party. My group was the biggest at 10.  Everything was great! Each course had 3 options for a drink pairing and every person in the room basically got their food and drinks at the same time. This to me made the experience very communal even with people you didn't know.   Also, the main entree was turkey and they accommodated my veggie life style by giving my a hefty plate of all the delicious veggies.  They are tucked away in the back corner of the flats and have a free parking lot, great view of the lake, and cool relaxed ambience.  I definitely recommend trying one of their tasting nights."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise this place was! We came here for lunch on the recommendation of someone at the Greater Cleveland Aquarium. We had just finished our visit and wanted something nearby and on the river, family friendly, reasonably priced, and, of course, delicious. We had never heard of this place and were intrigued when we were told it was owned by the Cleveland Metroparks. I'm so glad we checked it out, because it definitely has everything we were looking for! PLUS free and easy parking.   We were originally quoted a 45-minute wait, but the hostess took our phone number so we went to hang out in front on the river. It's right next to a bridge, so we got to watch the bridge raise for the Goodtime III to come through. We only ended up waiting about 15 minutes; they called to tell us our table was ready, as promised. The hostess was very friendly. We sat on the patio where we had a great view of the river. We got to see a few more boats pass, including one of those massive shipping barges. Fantastic atmosphere - very casual. Giant jenga sets and a large stone fireplace with couches for lounging help to create that laid-back air.  Our waiter was very friendly, and drinks and food came out fairly quickly. Amongst my group, we can vouch for the tastiness of the apple bacon grilled cheese, the beef & mushroom melt, the fiesta burger, and the Cuban. All were delicious! Half of us got the house-made chips (huge slices of potatoes fried to a tasty crunch!), the other half sprung for the upcharge for fries (so fresh - perfect for soaking up malt vinegar!). We had a few kiddos with us, who also enjoyed their meals: cheeseburger & chips, and Mac & cheese (served in a small cast-iron skillet - parents beware!! Cute presentation but terrible idea to give a kid a hot cast iron skillet! I just poured it onto the plate so she could eat it). These kid portions were HUGE!!! GREAT value!!!   We didn't partake in any adult beverages at this meal, but they had a decent selection of craft beers (tap and bottle) and wine. I would love to come back in the evening some time and relax in front of that fire with a beer!!  We will definitely be returning - especially now that I've looked up their brunch menu. Looks amazing!"}
{"text":"Went here recently for lunch.  It was a beautiful day so the location was a perfect way to enjoy the sunshine.  They have a nice patio which I'm sure gets used a lot on warmer days. We sat inside because it wasn't quite warm to eat outside. I would've liked to sit next to the fire pit and enjoy a glass of wine, but was busy chasing my little guy around.    Service was good, no complaints there. The food was fine, but nothing too memorable, except the size of the pretzel.  I should've trusted another Yelper's review when it was described as a meal for 3-4 adults.  Seriously, it's gigantic.  A little too salty for my taste, but it was warm and soft and came with a mustard and cheese sauce.  I also got the mac n cheese. It came in a hot cast iron dish.  It was gooey and cheesy, but it didn't knock my socks off.  My fellow diners had burgers. If you get a side of vegetables instead of fries, prepare for a big bowl of yummy roasted veggies.   The main attraction of this place is the location. The food is good, but it is pretty standard American fare. I'd still come back if I wanted to enjoy the view and wanted a decent lunch."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, our experience was horrible from start to finish. The drink orders took forever to arrive at our table, and virtually everyone's meal was messed up. Cold fries, wrong burgers delivered, dry chicken, etc. And then to top it all off, when we asked the manager Terry to correct the situation, he did nothing. In fact, he was rather rude when we approached him again at the end of the evening after no adjustments were made to anyone's bill. And the worst part was that this was my wife's 50th birthday dinner and she actually had to get napkins and silverware for the whole table because the waitress never brought them out. This is the first time I have ever written an online review and the last time I will ever go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Merwin's Wharf and went there because we had heard good things about the restaurant and love the fact it's on the river.   We went for lunch and both had the specials - crab stuffed cod with fresh green beans and mashed red skins and a bone in pork chop with coleslaw and fries. The food was excellent! Cooked to perfection - excellent taste.   The atmosphere was nice with great views of the river and a laid back feel which is what we were looking for today.  The only thing that's stopping me from giving Merwin's a better rating is the service.   It's took at least 10 minutes to get our drink order (beer and wine), the appetizer we ordered never arrived and neither did the malt vinegar my husband accepted at the servers suggestion. All this was after we told her we were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary.   She did offer to bring the appetizer out but we had already received our main meal and at that point why bother. We would have liked to order another round of drinks and she did offer dessert on her but by this time we lost confidence in our server especially after seeing she brought the table next to us vinegar and ketchup.  Working in the customer service industry I expect better especially when we mentioned we were there for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I didn't know there was a casino in the flats.  From the previous reviews( half rave about the food and atmosphere, and the other half cringe at the poor service and mediocre food) i'd say my wife and I hit the jackpot.  We waited for 10-15 minutes for a table on a Friday at 5 PM, then enjoyed excellent service, with prompt delivery of tasty fish tacos, and a very fresh salad, and reasonably priced beer and wine.  You wonder how much the inconsistent service and food has to do with the restaurant being run by a government entity- The Cleveland Metroparks.    The Metrroparks run some beautiful, well maintained golf courses, have done a great job rehabbing Edgewater Park, and keep the Metroparks clean and inviting all year long.  I could just see if the City of Cleveland ran Merwin's. They would bring you a glass of water, tell you it's  taken care of, then on your way out the door they'd hit you with a $164,000 charge on your bill.  Or, if Cuyahoga County ran the restaurant, they would have 100 waiters for 25 tables.  Waiters who only serve salads, some who just serve drinks, others for entrees, and some who supervise.  If the State of Ohio ran the restaurant, there would be a gas well drilled in the middle of the dining room.  Hopefully, our next visit Merwin's, our visit is as good as our first."}
{"text":"I suggested Mother's Day brunch for our family of four. This brunch was awful. Talk about gouging on a \"holiday.\" No way was the menu worth $28.95, more like $14.95. The choices were low end and the menu was so limited..really pot roast cut into chunk, sausage and peppers for that price. Oatmeal was a big glob which made it almost unrecognizable. Even the desserts looked like they came from Cosco's freeze and thaw. We've been there many times for dinner and lunch, always brought friends along. So cheated that we won'tbe coming back anytime soon and especially not for brunch. Shameful."}
{"text":"WE were there on a chilly fall afternoon. The view is always great and everyone has a great time. Service was a little slow but the Chicken and Biscuits were excellent. My husband had the Cuban sandwich and seemed happy with that and his tasty hot fries. We will go again but service could be better."}
{"text":"We had 130 of our Realtors and family from The EZ Sales Team there for a Christmas party.  The food was outstanding, the service was above expected, the atmosphere was unmatched and the cost was low.  If you are considering a location to have your next party, I recommend them highly.   This was in the Winter so I can only imagine how wonderful it would be there in the Summer.   5 Stars!  #ClevelandProud"}
{"text":"After reading reviews i was a little hesitant to try it but it was a great place. We were greeted & after some confusion w/seating finally sat at a table . Ten minutes passed before we were offered drinks :( but after that service & food were amazing. Great view! Loved watching the crew go by. Nice trails to walk after a filling meal. Food was worth the wait. Great brunch! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Wondering what to do on a lazy Saturday or Sunday? Come to Merwin's Wharf! This is def a new hidden gem to Cleveland. We came here for lunch following the Flea last Saturday was definitely impressed. They have indoor and outdoor seating along the river bank in the flats. Part of the outdoor seating is first come first serve (high top-bar style seating) where as the other is huge tables with umbrella's. We had to wait about 35 minutes to sit outside, but well worth the wait. To start off, their drink menu is out of this world... rum runners, 3 types of Bloody Mary's, cheap bottled and draft beer- list is endless. We bypassed the apps, however we are already planning on coming back for the loaded fires! For lunch we split a burger and the chicken, back, cheese sandwich. The burger was just ok- typical a little overdone. But the chicken sandwich was AMAZING! I highly recommend it. The fires were also to die for.   The only complaint was that their was only 1 waiter for the whole outside- def need more out there for better service."}
{"text":"Friendly, clean, unique, delicious! Corn hole, beautiful view! Yummy food. Great for people of all ages.  Dog friendly. Unique menu.   Great for a healthy diet. Good wine selection."}
{"text":"We went a few weekends ago on a Sunday when they had the clam and lobster bake available. Excellent service from the bar and the wait staff. The food was amazing! I was reluctant to order the giant fresh pretzel as I'm not a huge pretzel fan but forget everything you know about pretzels and order this thing! With sides of beer cheese and mustard it was redic!!! Also the mussels and siracha wings were fantastic.   OK, I'm gonna run out of adjectives soon!   At our table we ordered the clam bake, a lobster bake, and Walleye tacos. All were soooo delicious!! The Manhattan clam chowder that came with the bake was out of this world. I'd come back just for that! With just enough chorizo to give it a little kick...I ate every drop of the generous bowl. We left with very full bellies and a huge smile on our faces to have found this new gem on the river!  Way to go Metroparks!!  PS- we would have loved to eat outside but they'll need propane heaters for that. The wood burning fire pits are nice but not to eat next to."}
{"text":"Delicious dinner at this place run by the metro park system.  The menu is limited, but the prices are low and the service and management friendly.  We came after dark so we couldn't enjoy the surrounding beauty, but we will be back."}
{"text":"came here yesterday for the coursed valentines dinner. The food and service from the server was amazing and everything was delicious. I'm only giving this place 2 stars though because while here less than an ear shot away was some of one of the managers friends. Because of their ties, this table got various free goodies. No biggie, I've worked in the service industry and know how that goes. What made the situation not right was that I attempted to order the lobster tail and my server told me they were out yet when the managers friends entrees came out 20 minutes after ours did they magically had a lobster tail for those guests? I totally get hooking up your friends, but don't do it at the expense of letting other guests down/ in on it."}
{"text":"Wait staff is a little slow and sometimes doesn't listen but other than that they get 5 out of 5 Stars the food is good to drink to report correctly and the event we were there were outstanding"}
{"text":"Went to Merwin's Wharf for Bloody Mary's and appetizers. We chose this place because we wanted somewhere with nice outside seating. We sat on the deck overlooking the river and a trail. The parking lot looked like it shared parking with those who wanted to bike or walk on the trail. It was a really nice outside space. The Bloody Marys were very good! The nachos were just okay, but the famous huge pretzel was delicious! The dough was flaky and sweet, kind of like a croissant. And HUGE! It was served with beer cheese and a spicy mustard and they were both great. The three of us shared it, and then took some home. That was the only food we ordered so I can't speak for the rest of the menu, but I would certainly go back to Merwin's to try more!"}
{"text":"Love the pretzel and the view! They need better side choices especially for the kids!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Friendly owner and staff. Made us feel like family. The lobster was amazing. Will definitely return when we are back in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Merwin's Wharf is on its way to being the go-to destination for brunch-going, summer-loving Cleveland boaters, boarders, and rowers.  PROS *Spacious! Merwin's Wharf square footage is big...I don't do numbers, so I will just compare it to Town Hall. They have a patio that wraps around two sides of the building, along with a couple of fire pit areas. A walkway/overlook deck wraps around the patio. Inside the restaurant, there is ample room, including a separate room for private events. You could get lost in this place! *Dog-friendly. Happiness oozes out of me when I am allowed to bring my child aka my dog with me to a facility. I'm not sure if dogs are allowed inside (I didn't ask), but they are more than welcome outside on the patio. *Friendly service. Our hostess and waitress were super friendly. Without even asking, they brought out a dog bowl of water for my pup. *Human-powered watercraft docking. There are plenty of places to drop in your paddleboard, kayak, canoe, etc. right along the dock that spans the width of the restaurant (and probably even a little longer than that) *Location, Part 1. Because it's located on the river, sitting on the patio really makes you feel like it's summer. You can see ships sailing, rowers rowing, boarders boarding...you get the jist.  CONS *Location, Part 2. Okay, Cleveland. Your river may have caught on fire in the past, but it looks like nobody cleaned up after the blaze. Across from the restaurant, on the other side of the river, was a giant pile of trash. The water itself looks like a river of ... you can fill in the blank. The riverfront, in general, just needs to be cleaned up in order for water sports to really succeed along the Cuyahoga. *The food was just okay. We came during lunch/brunch time and I got a Caesar salad. It wasn't terrible, but it was not really that great either. I also got a mimosa that tasted too much like just orange juice.  *Other than the rowing area, nearby skate park, and handful of other restaurants, there's not much else down this way. And I wouldn't walk down this way by myself in the dark - definitely becomes a shady place at night, in more ways than one.  BOTTOM LINE On the next sunny day in Cleveland, walk your dog and significant other down to the wharf and grab a drink on the patio!"}
{"text":"Ok. So I know this ace just opened about a week ago and they may b working out some kinks... But I just could not give it more then 3 stars based on the food mostly.    The location is tricky to get to since roads r closed and so many changes happening in Cle that my gps was giving me a hard time even w/her \"recalculating\"....once there it's a great location and they have their own parking lot! Bonus for the Cle area.     It was a nice Friday summer night and super busy.  At 6pm there was a 30 min. Wait for the inside and a 2 hour wait to sit outside, by 7 it was a 3 hour wait for the patio.  There r only like 7 tables outside. But don't fret, it's fine to b inside too since they open all the doors in the back to the outside anyway.    Staff was nice, but they were severely understaffed.  Once we were seated, it took forever for everything!!!  Not sure if it was just our waitress or what, but it was painful and one person w/me said they felt like a prisoner in there at one point.     Onto the food.  For an app we got the calamari.  DON'T do it!  It was small super rubbery and tasteless despite the peppers.  U will b disappointed w/it.  The grilled chicken on the Italian sandwich was gross.  It had these burnt \"grill\" marks that seemed fake.  It tasted and smelled really bad!  Our server apologized and she asked if we wanted something else so we got a burger medium-well.   It came out w/the same weird burnt smell and it was charred and so burnt tasting we couldn't eat it.  It came w/a side if homemade chips, that must have been sitting for so long because they were not crispy, but flexible and chewy.  The side salad we had was good and so was the ranch.  Now, the best thing was the Lake Erie perch sliders w/their slaw!  Omg!  Loved every bite!!!   We will go back to try some other menu items.  It's a great place to go drink w/some friends.  However, we will avoid any grilled items!  Hopefully next time I can leave an updated review with more stars."}
{"text":"I took my four year old to the New years event in January 2016. The little party was very fun for her. There was a magic show, face painting, balloon artist, dancing, a little balloon drop at noon, and a big buffet. We paid $18 per person. A lil pricey and the food was DISGUSTING!!! Lots of food on the buffet. Breakfast and lunch items. It LOOKED delicious and very appetizing. Taste? Worse then frozen food. No seasoning, flavors absent as well. I'm not sure if all their food is prepared this way, but we tried everything on this buffet for this party and it was all nasty! We left the table with full plates of food. I looked around and many people did not eat their food. Took one bite and left the rest. May have been worth the price if the food had been tasty or even edible!"}
{"text":"I wish I could keep this place to myself but the secret's out. Merwin's Wharf is my new favorite spot with a view in CLE. The Cleveland Metroparks did a fabulous job designing both the interior and exterior of this river front gem. Garage doors open onto a wrap around patio that includes a wood burning fire pit and a gas fireplace, tons of tables and comfy couches. Rowers, freighters, kayaks and other boats provide regular entertainment as they pass by.  The food: My husband and I both had the sockeye salmon special and our friends both had the fried perch dinner. Everyone was very happy with our selections and the prices were good. The beer selection is decent - I think we are spoiled because so many places have a huge craft beer list these days.  The service: We sat at the bar while we waiting for our table and the bartender was great. For dinner, our waitress was prompt, helpful and pleasant.   The only SUPER annoying thing about this place is the they refuse to take same day reservations. Really. When I called twice to clarify this unreasonable rule, I was given some sort of nonsense without any real explanation of why this is their policy. If tables are available, why don't they take a reservation? We had out of town company and 14 of us wanted to eat here but without a reservation there was no way we were taking a chance and having to wait 2 hours for a table. I know that the Metroparks aren't used to running a restaurant but common sense should tell them that if they have open tables and people want to sit at them, they should do what every other normal restaurant does.  Other than that one gripe, we can't complain. I'm almost looking forward to summer ending just so I can snuggle up by the fire."}
{"text":"Fish taco's were average....avocado, lettuce, cucumber wrap was a joke, no avocado, server brought out side of avocado 10 mins after we finished. Kitchen was pathetically slow, table turnover is horrific.  After chatting w/ bartender found out this place being on the river is NOT boater friendly. The sliver of dock we tied up to is suppose to have sign saying no docking. Establishment does not want and I quote \"boater riff-raff here, they can stay at Shooters\".  Needless to say the bartender was shocked to find out we came in by boat and the remainder of time spent waiting for our table was w/out service or conversation. I asked the waitress why they didn't make restaurant accessible for boaters, she re-iterated they don't want \"the boating kind\". Then figured out we came in by boat and changed the official reason to our safety w/ the barge traffic. I called BS, the place used to be the Commodore Club, boats were lined up and down river edge two deep for in/out rack storage, same barges/freighters back then as now.   I may stop back for a drink at the bar, bring a few friends, all on our Harley's. Maybe the next conversation I'll have w/ bartender will be the new rule is no motorcycles. Funny how the Metroparks has no problem taking EVERYONE'S tax dollars but limiting access as they see fit."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday afternoon at 1:15.  The restaurant, view and the area are beautiful.  We were thinking \"what a great place!\"  The lady at the front desk with short dark hair gave the longest drawn out reason for how long we had to wait for a table.  Her explanation was so long that several groups in front of us simply walked out in frustration.  She was trying to say that they only take reservations for some tables, but not all, and they only seat some people as walk-ins and it's first come first serve.  She said there were 8 groups that came in at 11:30 and 4 of the 8 groups were still there at 1:15, so she didn't know how long until we could be seated.  Never in all my years of dining out have I been given such an explanation as to why and how long it would be until we could be seated.  In any case, we decided to wait and ordered a drink at the bar, and waited on the outside patio for them to ring our cell.  We were called at 2:00 and we ordered by 2:15 and didn't get the food for what felt like a very long time.  It was then that I understood why the people who came in at 11:30 were still there at 1:15.  Once the food finally came, it was very mediocre.  I had a salad with \"local greens\" and \"organic grilled chicken\".  Well, the lettuce was head lettuce and I have no idea if the chicken was truly organic.  It was very mediocre and not a $14 salad...maybe a $6 salad.  My husband had the fish tacos and he enjoyed them.  Although he was told they were spicy and they were not.  Their service staff needs a lot of work.  It's been open for a year now, I hope they start getting it right!  They do have late hours and a big selection of beers, so it might be a great summer evening place to go and hang on the patio.  There is no docking, so motor boats are not allowed, unfortunately. Oh, and they do not take American Express."}
{"text":"What Merwin's Wharf lacks in food quality, it makes up for in atmosphere! Large patio situated right on the Cuyahoga River; it's a great spot to watch kayaks, barges, and everything in between float on by while you sip your drink. The food is fairly average here; nothing to write home about. The portions are small for the price and the flavor is rather bland. The avocado ranch dressing leaves much to be desired and I had a hard time figuring out what, exactly, about the Southwest chicken salad made it worth $14. This venue is better suited to lunch or for after-dinner drinks. So while the food is lackluster, it's really the location of this restaurant that is the star of the show. What a unique experience!"}
{"text":"Perfect lunch spot! Stopped at 3:00, table on the patio, sitting in the sun, enjoying a yummy turkey wrap and fries. Friendly service. Definitely will go back for dinner under the patio lights."}
{"text":"Don't call it Moscow Mule if you don't have copper mugs to serve it!  The drinks are over charged, blend tasting!"}
{"text":"The Metroparks did a beautiful job on the layout and atmosphere of Merwin's. The open seating looks out onto the river, and there's not a bad seat, whether you're indoors or on the patio. In the summer, you can watch the rowers and boats cruise by. Merwin's is beginning to feel like a neighborhood staple of the Flats. The servers are very friendly, and the bartender handles big crowds like a pro.  There's plenty of free parking in the lot right outside. However, i'd still encourage car pooling or grabbing an uber. The lot can fill up quickly during peak times. When the weather is nice, Merwin's is great for happy hour-- its dog friendly, they have fire pits, and the outdoor seating accommodates large groups comfortably. A trip to Merwin's is definitely for the experience, so the next time you and friends need a place to relax and enjoy a good beer, head to Merwin's."}
{"text":"Why is the preppy white family the business photo for this business?  Really sums up the place nicely.  Anyway, I have been here a few times.  Once cuz I wanted to suss it out and others for work parties.  Im not an obnoxious \"I wana sit on the patio\" person.  I could care less.  Nice enough looking place.  Servers are always nice and friendly.  Food was good.  Drinks are a tad overpriced for what they are.  The skatepark is 100 yard s away and so is Brick And Barrel.  Its fun to park and make an afternoon of it.  Just start drinkin' after ya decide to drop in, trust me...."}
{"text":"The Metroparks are getting into the restaurant business in a big way.  I've stopped for happy hour and lunch on Saturday and find the food to be well prepared and tasty if not adventurous.  The giant pretzel is quite good,but you'll need four people to eat it. Experienced bar staff and excellent cocktails.  Awesome location and when the Columbus Road bridge is finally (ever?) opened this place will be jammed all summer long"}
{"text":"Best Cuban sandwich I have had in Cleveland. Great views of the river. A true hidden gem of Cleveland. Owned and operated by the metroparks."}
{"text":"Wonderful spot to eat along the River. Patio dining is perfect in the summer or fall. Great for a quick business meeting or a nice evening with family, friends or a loved one. Reasonable prices, friendly staff. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I would absolutely recommend the catfish dinner! It was amazing. Perfect- a light crunchy coating, served hot and with fresh chips and coleslaw. They have a large patio on the cuyahoga river within the metro parks. Great Way to relax on a Sunday afternoon. Not the best service we have had but certainly some of the best food."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 3 stars because my food was pretty awful, but because of the patio I really just can't.   Food, 2 stars. Everything else? A 5 star for sure.   Seriously, this patio is out of this world! The atmosphere is amazing and even if it wasn't on the water it's still just great. I will absolutely be back here for drinks, but I'll definitely eat before I come -- although I'm dying to try their grenades. They were out of them tonight.   My food? Their garden salad, add chicken, which came to $12. It was really the portion of a side salad (for entree pricing) and the amount of chicken didn't warrant $6 extra, and the quality/taste wasn't really good either. I left feeling pretty hungry. I don't like ordering something at a restaurant and then going home and having to cook; it defeats the purpose, and with the quality of my chicken I wasn't trying to order another entree.   My husband was pretty impressed with his mac though, although I don't know that it was worth $15?  It did take awhile to get the food as some people have mentioned (friends appetizer came out quickly though) but that bothered us none as we were in no rush to get out of there quickly. Service was good."}
{"text":"A miserable experience. Went there because we had tickets to a show nearby. We left plenty of time. When we checked in with the hostess, she said it would be a 30-45 min. wait to sit outside by the water. I gave my name. After 50 min. I went inside only to be told it would be at least another 15 min. wait. We couldn't wait that long so we opted for an inside table. We were then seated at a table with no silverware, no waitress and ultimately no food.  A miserable experience.  I would never go back and neither should you."}
{"text":"This place is all about the atmosphere. Cleveland MetroParks made a classy move bringing in such a stylish place, but improvements need to be made.   Sitting on the patio next to the water is just wonderful. The only problem is you can never get a table. It is always a 1to 2 hour wait. Not sure if it is too few tables, the staff or the slow kitchen that makes the wait so long. Maybe it is that people just don't leave because the atmosphere is so charming. I'm not sure, but the wait to get seated is much too long no matter how good the atmosphere is.   We finally sat at the bar to decrease the wait time and our service was just o.k.  It always seems strange that if someone is right in front of you tending bar that they don't see that you need service. It's really crazy.   The wine was OUTRAGEOUS in price. Wow, I have not seen such high wine prices since we were in a five star restaurant in Atlanta. The food portion size was very small and the price was high and the wait was very long, so.... for these reasons we will not return. There are lots of other great patios by the water in Cleveland with much better prices and good food. So Sad!"}
{"text":"Three stars is about right. There's a lot of potential here (great space, wonderful setting, decent menu). It's not quite fully realized yet due to some service issues (sluggish but friendly servers and a somewhat surly hostess on our visit) and food missteps (rubbery calamari). This place is still pretty good, and well worth a visit thanks to the strength of its location. I hope it improves so the whole experience matches the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Visited Merwin's Wharf today for brunch after hearing great things and found myself quite underwhelmed.   We arrived and put in our names for a table and were told it would be an hour wait and they would text us when a table was ready. We weren't quite prepared for that, but took the time to walk around the area a bit. There are various benches / couches / etc. where you can park yourself while you wait for a table, but the hostess neglected to direct us to them...we did hear her telling another couple about them later as we were leaving, though. Walking around the building we noticed that while we were on a 1-hour wait list, there were 11 empty tables, inside and out combined. It's always disconcerting to be told there is a wait and then find out that literally half the restaurant is empty.   After about 30 minutes we sat inside hear the hostess station and killed time. My wife went up to the hostess station after we'd waited around 45 minutes total to get a look at the menu, and was told \"Oh, your table is ready we tried to call you but you didn't answer.\" I had been looking at my phone for the 15 minutes prior to that, and not so much as a peep, so they clearly wrote down my number wrong. Aggravating, but mistakes happen. They seated us outside on the mostly empty patio.   We started off with waters and I ordered the Hemingway's Day Off, a rum drink that boasted Navy Strength rum, a touch of lime, seasonal fruit, and basil syrup. Sounds perfect for brunch outside! Eleven dollars later I got a martini glass filled with pulpy lime juice that perhaps, in another life, had been briefly introduced to someone named \"Rum\". Hemingway would have beaten someone senseless for serving him that.   It took about 25 minutes for our food to arrive (again, in a half-full restaurant that should have come out a bit faster) and it was about 50/50. My wife's Egg Sandwich ($9 - we ordered from the Brunch Menu) was fantastic, although being a vegetarian she skipped the pork belly which I did want to try. It came with Black Bean Hash, which appeared to be a child's order of french fries from McDonalds, cubed and thrown back into the fryer, and served with about 9 black beans mixed in for garnish. I ordered the Biscuits & Gravy ($12) and was disappointed to find two incredibly small biscuits in a tiny cast iron skillet with almost, but not quite, enough gravy to cover them. My side order of Wharf Hash was the same disappointing french fry concoction, which the menu states is \"cooked in bacon fat and herbs\" although I can't imagine how you could do that without imparting some kind of actual flavor. The bacon fat alone should have made them delicious, but they were dry and tasted like vegetable oil. The chorizo gravy on the biscuits was quite nice, and the biscuits themselves were alright, but it was a side order masquerading as an entree. If they had been incredibly delicious, I'd have been fine with the small portion. If they had been bountiful, I'd have been fine with the mediocrity. But they just didn't have enough going for them for me to ever want them again.   It seems clear that Merwin's Wharf is struggling through some growing pains. During the meal I counted 5 servers to 13 occupied tables, while people at the door were being turned away left and right with a wait time that ranged from 45 minutes to 2 hours. As we left I heard the hostess blaming the kitchen for the delay, saying \"they got a big rush and couldn't keep up\". Considering how few people were seated and ordering it seemed suspect that the kitchen couldn't keep up. It also seemed like bad form for a hostess to throw another group of the staff under the bus instead of just giving some kind of \"we're just a bit short-staffed today, so our wait time is longer than usual\" answer which covers the bases, lets your guests know there will be a wait, and doesn't put the blame on anyone specific. Treat your kitchen right!  Our server, Katie K. was fantastic, attentive, and quick. Although since she couldn't have had more than one or two other tables I guess that made it easier to be...we tipped her well since she clearly wasn't going to make any $$ on volume today and headed out.   The location is nice, and will be better once the rest of the Metroparks trails are finally connected to it. The menu isn't bad but needs some fine tuning to make it really shine. The wait staff is going to need better volume of tables if they're going to make enough money to want to stay there. The bartender should be shot. We're going to check back in 5 or 6 months and see how it goes but for now...caveat emptor."}
{"text":"The layout and scenery is beautiful. The staff is poorly trained the menu is boring and limited. We waited an hour to be seated on a beautiful Sunday evening (had no problem waiting) it was all down hill from here. We waited 48 minutes and all soups and apps came out together and cold. This is not my first experience like that at this place. Lots of new options downtown don't see much of a reason to go here. The bartenders are \"mature\" and have no concept of any of the beers, or drinks they're pouring."}
{"text":"I'm sure this place is great in the summer.   They have a great patio and drink list is nice.  Their food is OK.  I had the pork shank.  It wasn't as tender as I was hoping.    The service we had was sooo polite.  I wish their food was better."}
{"text":"Dog friendly great outside area and fire pit even in winter u can sit outside by fire and river"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday for the brunch buffet. All the food was good. They offered a nice array of breakfast and lunch items from waffles to stuffed cabbage. Surprised to see the bad reviews on the service. Our server was pleasant and attentive. My husband loved his Bloody Mary. We will definitely be back to enjoy the beatific setting and relaxed atmosphere. Well done Metroparks."}
{"text":"I've only had apps and drinks here so I can't comment on the food. The apps are good nothing special. But the location is great, and very popular. I've taken my family and friends several times and its great to grab a beer and play jenga."}
{"text":"Service and food need help. How can such a new place have stale chips?  Love the location. I hope it improves!!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch visit. Probably the only thing the Metroparks doesn't excel at. Kitchen is disorganized when busy and has a hard time keeping up. Quality of food suffers as a result. Wait staff has to hover at kitchen window hoping their customers food will emerge. Bacon undercooked and greasy. Hash browns underwhelming and greasy. Nevertheless service was outstanding and venue is great. Oh well, can't have it all, even in the Metroparks."}
{"text":"Love this place! Probably my favorite patio of all places in the area. I've only been twice, but both times were totally a good time, with so much to do and different scenery depending on if you're in the front, or back, or on the side or inside! There is so much to do at this place. Go to the back bar, where there are couches and a bar. Go on the side, where you have a perfect view of the water and seats for dinning. Go to the front, big grassy area, where there is usually games going on, or sometimes concerts on the lawn, like a mini blossom experience. Go inside for a typical bar experience, but surrounded by open doors to give you a breeze from the water. The food was just okay, I would probably eat here again, but I for sure will return for a summer day of drinking! A must check out if you live in the are, full of views of Cleveland and near by some other Cleveland gems!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and every time I come, the waiters and waitresses get ditizier and ditizier.  It's nothing that's necessarily bad, it's become kind of amusing to me.  The first time I came was right after they first opened, and I would order a PBR and the waitress kept trying to give me what she said was a blue moon. Nothing major. Another time I sat at the bar and there was an old man taking care of us.  He put fries with all of our orders-which we agreed to-and it ended up being a $2 upcharge.  We didn't really care because we still would have gotten fries even if he thought they came with it (chips came with the entrees), but he felt so bad and kept apologizing. He gave us a dollar off per beer on our next round of beer. It was really nice, especially since we didn't mind the extra charge-it luckily wasn't going to make or break us.  I tried to order the soft pretzel, but they somehow were totally out.  The last time I stopped in, the waitress must have been new....my brother wanted a chicken sandwhich instead of a burger, and she said she would have to check with the chef to see if they could do that. He had to show her the menu to show that substation was allowed. Not a big, but I hope she gets to learning the menu a little better.   I was able to order the soft pretzel this time and OMG it was awesome.  First, it's like a mega pretzel.  Comes with cheese and some kind of dark colored mustard that tastes like A1 sauce. The pretzel itself tastes pretty similar to the Auntie Anne's pretzels. Super good.  Other than that, I've only ever ordered the burger.  It's just a burger.  The patio is awesome.  Metroparks did a really great job getting this place together.  The inside is also very nice, but I love sitting outside and watching the boats go by.  Definitely a pace to check out, especially if you like sitting outside when the weather's nice.  p.s. they do not accept American Express"}
{"text":"Location...  A+.  Can't beat location along Cuyahoga River... don't get any better than that   Food... B.    My brother had the fish tacos... very good... my burger was OK, nothing special... my wife's pecan strawberries blueberries salad was decent, but dressing was forgotten and our server couldn't be found...  needed to ask another worker to get dressing for us... also fries were served lukewarm   Service... D.   Restaurant wasn't very busy, our server just simply forgot about us.... maybe she had a bad day... after a half hour she checked in on us... finally we received refills on our ice tea   Overall... usually don't complain in my reviews... disappointed with our experience... best part was being alongside the river... too man great places to eat out in Cleveland, we won't return"}
{"text":"When a business, regardless of the industry they are in, performs well, I will give credit when and where credit is due. I was impressed with Merwin's Wharf! The food was good, as was the service. It's nice to find a reasonably priced place to dine in the Flats... and one with adequate parking. Overall my experience was excellent. I loved being  close to the river. Would recommend."}
{"text":"This is a great summer location where you can eat outside or in and see the boat activity from either.  I wish someone would improve the quality of the food.  If you serve a burger for $12.00 it should be top quality beef, even Ohio beef would be great.  The same applies to the fish. We'll go again but be very careful about our menu choices.  The staff is efficient, warm and friendly and that includes the manager."}
{"text":"Not really a review, but I looked at the website and was excited to see a \"Wharf\" on the water...the strange thing is that they don't feature seafood.  I can get the feature foods here at almost anyplace downtown.  Rating it 3 stars because of style of food, not because of quality, which I am sure is good"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to merwins several times. Always good and the thirsty dog tasting put it over the top. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Went here one Sunday afternoon to meet up with some friends.  It was about 1:30pm and we were told that they were only serving the brunch buffet at the time and the lunch menu wouldn't start until 2pm.  The \"all you can eat\" brunch buffet was a little pricey so my friends and I ordered the nachos appetizers to tie us over until 2pm when we could order off the lunch menu.  The nachos were forgettable.  Just nothing special about it, lacked flavor and the chips were pretty dry and burnt in areas.  For lunch both of my friends had Cubans and said it was good.  It came on thick slices of bread which was unexpected and my friends could barely finish their sandwiches and took it to go.  I ordered the Antichoke and arugula sandwich. It came with a sirracha cabbage I believe and it definitely had a kick to it but overall it was really good and I ate it all.  Chips came with the sandwiches and they were so much better than the nachos we had as appetizers.  I had a winter sangria which was also pretty forgettable.  It was stronger than I usually like and the flavor just tasted watered down.  Definitely had much better sangrias elsewhere.  Service was good and the place was very quiet and laid back.  There was pretty empty for a Sunday afternoon.  I think I'd like to come back in the spring / summer time so I can sit out on the patio overlooking the water."}
{"text":"Is an ok place.  Pricey and service shotty.  Don't let the name fool ya either, this is NOT a seafood restaurant. Family of 5 for lunch, (3 kids. Teen and preteen) no alcohol, no dessert... only four entrees (wife had an appetizer pretzel and side salad).2 meals were 1/2 rack ribs, a burger, & a salmon dinner...  $130.00+.  Service was lacking, had to wait long for soda refill... then she brought a ice tea back instead (I had a coke).  She didn't hear me as she walked away when trying to tell her wrong drink.  Then she disappeared for 15 minutes.    Seating around bar, bad idea. The bar crowd, hanging over our table, bumping chairs... to the point I intentionally put a empty seat at end of table to push them back a little. Every time got up hit person standing behind me with my chair.  Food was fare.  Not horrible, but not good either.  We will not be return customers.    However, we did get seated in 10 minutes. (After being told 55 minute wait)  Only reason not a 1 star.  Family of 5, very busy day (event going on on the river), nice view, nice ambience.   ."}
{"text":"The patio is beautiful and very cozy. We went at 4 pm so it wasn't incredibly busy but our waitress still seemed really rushed-maybe they need more waitstaff? She was still nice and quick. We got the lobster bake and clams. Everything just seemed a little overcooked. The lobster was pretty good; it's hard to mess that up. The clams were a little rubbery but overall okay-mostly, the mussels were shriveled up and we couldn't even eat them because there was nothing there. The potatoes and chicken were dry. Just a little pricey for the quality of cooking we got."}
{"text":"Scenic location. Good food. They currently do not take reservations. Yesterday there was an 1 1/2 hour wait for a party of two. Ended up going elsewhere for dinner. Probably won't go back unless they change their \"no reservation\" policy."}
{"text":"Just left...the atmosphere and location is great! Music could have been a little louder could barely hear it! The food was just ok. I had the Merwin sandwich, it was a little greasy and just alright. I may have come back and tried something else, but after the service we had at the bar...that is an absolute no!! The bartender didn't even pay any attention to us, never asked how our food was. My husband had to get up and get his own silverware and hot sauce off the server cart. We couldn't leave because the check she had in front of us didn't have our beers on it, and being honest people we wanted to pay for them. Just over all bad experience."}
{"text":"So this place and employees are all employed by Metro Parks. That is the main reason I will go back. The burgers were good a little pricey but the money goes to green space and keeping it Green. It was cold so not outdoor dining but will go back come summer. There's a great little dock you could launch a kayak. We didn't drink but we will at some point. So far It's a place we will return to service was great staff friendly."}
{"text":"They have an awesome patio area with a nice fireplace spot. The atmosphere is very relaxed which is exactly what I was looking for. I had their mac n' cheese and it was delicious! Definitely coming back for a visit. Only thing keeping me from giving five stars is our waitress needed a little work."}
{"text":"Maybe that's what you get when a park tries to run a restaurant but man they move slow. Makes it not worth the effort and the view since it is so poorly run."}
{"text":"Disappointed in this Metroparks restaurant.  The menus needs help.  My wife had the berry salad which was mostly Roman lettuce and mostly rusty. I had the Asian noodle salad. Tasty, but way too much peanut sauce. We originally asked for calamari, but was told they were out. Our second choice was the fish tacos , again there was a problem.  Entries were lacking as was the sandwich selection"}
{"text":"The venue is five stars--on the water, great views of the flats, clean, fire place and outdoor fire pit for cool nights; however service and management of staff is chaotic and three stars at best. We sat at a half empty bar on a Wednesday afternoon for ten or twelve minutes without bartender even asking if he could help us as he was more attentive to stocking glasses and talking to wait staff.  The hostess acted like we were bothering her in asking for a table and offered no accommodation in terms of where we should wait or if we could wander outside. The wait staff seems numerous but also as if they're running around with little organization, and getting one's food can be a very slow process. Food has been good/tasty both at Sunday brunch and at times I've visited for dinner, but our afternoon visit turned into one drink at the bar and on to the flats to eat elsewhere where someone would pay a little kind attention to us."}
{"text":"You're there for the view of the river, not the food. Somewhat limited menu. Burgers are safe. If you get the grilled cheese, read carefully. It's Apple Bacon Grilled Cheese. Not Applewood Bacon. This is a sandwich with 2 slices of bacon, 2 slices of cheese and slices of apple. Kettle chips I opted for to accompany were flavorless. Price: $14. Too much for too little."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and this place is a gem. This last Saturday (late lunchtime) was crowded and they said it w/b an hour wait but so glad we stayed because we were seated at our table within 25 min! Love that they live in the 21st century & text you when your table's ready too. Initially we waited at a hightop near the outdoor bar & had drinks & an appetizer & just as we finished those the table was ready AND on the patio. What a lovely setting for this place right on the river. All four of us loved what we ordered; salmon BLT, Cuban, Asian noodles, & an artichoke grilled cheese. The pulled pork sliders appetizer came with 4 sliders & were substantial so that was the app we shared while waiting. Will definitely go back! Great 1st experience!"}
{"text":"Went there on a weekend 5 days after opening. Was a bit crowded and made more so by a rain storm that forced diners that were eating outside to be seated inside. In spite of this, the restaurant handled it very very efficiently. Quick turn time between placing order and getting food. Hand cut fries and good burgers. Kudos to Cleveland Metroparks. Cool building and outside on the river with outdoor fireplace. Good idea with garage doors to swing up  for summer."}
{"text":"Awesome location, great happy hour menu and prices, and excellent food and beer selection.   We stopped here after spending the afternoon at the Cleveland aquarium and we will definitely be back. The giant pretzel is just to die for and the dipping sauces are incredible!   The restaurant is very clean and open with a great patio right on the river. It just feels light and airy throughout the place. There's quite a few tables and a pretty large bar. It was much bigger than I expected from the outside.   Prices are pretty typical for the area and the portion sizes are quite large. They had a very good selection of craft beers on tap and in bottles. Prices for beers were quite reasonable.   The service is a bit slow and they were not very busy when I visited so that earned it 4 stars instead of 5, we asked for one sauce that took almost 5 minutes to get. Not a huge deal but it kept us from eating right away. Still not a huge deal to not visit this location. The staff was very nice and helpful when asked questions about the menu.   I will definitely be back (especially for the giant pretzel) and I would definitely recommend this place to others.   It is a bar / restaurant so for lunch brunch or early dinner it will be great for kids also but later at night it is more of a bar atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great location, views amazing. Disappointed that on Sunday, noon the entire menu was not available, but brunch was. The brunch featured an AMAZING shrimp and grits. There were eggs, sausage, potatoes, too. The French Toast sticks were extremely hard.  Weird additions were a salsbury steak patty in a gravy, and Italian sausage with some tomato-ish sause. This was a very random range of foods. Oh and bagels & creme cheese. The pies were really great as well. Apple was fresh, and homemade.    We had some drinks. The bloody mary was good, however was served with a brown, spoiled celery stalk.  When it was noticed-we asked the waitress to fix this. Besides being a bit rude, she took the drink, brought the same drink back with another celery stalk. However, she should have brought back a new fresh, drink, just to be food-safe. Then we decided to have coffee with our pie. We had to wave down the wait staffer to get her attention. She was chatting with another staffer who was cleaning a table, and she was again rude- \"just a minute...\"  Frankly- she should have asked us if we wanted coffee. When she brought it- instead of using the handle to hold the coffee, she clasped it around the top (where you drink with your mouth) with her fingers!  The worst thing that happened though was while we were eating (sitting inside by the open doors on the back side of this buffet table) a lid that covered the potatoes or eggs- fell on the floor when a manager was looking at the food. Did he rush that lid back to the kitchen?  NOPE! HE PICKED it up and placed in onto the TABLE!!! ( at least not on the food...) Then he WALKS AWAY!  I kept an eye on for a few minutes to see if he would come back to remove that dirty lid. He did not. So I gave it to another worker and told him it was on the floor.    The venue is nice. All our friends say the food is great. We may try a different time when the regular menu is up. But their lack of food safety knowledge is a bit unnerving!"}
{"text":"I waited for my third visit before writing a review in the hopes that some kinks would get worked out.  I'd rather give them 2.5 stars but since that's not an option, I'll round up for potential.  It's discouraging arriving at the hostess stand and being told it's a 45-60 min wait when there are clearly a number of open tables in the dining room.  I'm assuming this is because they are short staffed and want to be able to give diners their full attention.  Unfortunately, the service is still really slow and the quality isn't consistent.  In my recent (last Friday) party of 4, 3 of us ordered burgers served with fries.  We received 3 very different versions of fries--to my left was old and browned fries served as a very sparse portion, across from me was a scorching hot and maybe not fully cooked but large portion and I had fries that looked perfectly done but were cold and bland.  With that said, I'd still order the Fiesta Burger again.    As others said, the ambiance can't be beat and it's a prime spot to watch the barges and party boats.  The local beer choices are also positive--I love Fat Head's Trail Head and always feel better ordering it since some of the proceeds go back to the Metroparks.  The outside fire pit and fire place are really nice features.  I'm okay with cutting them some slack due to it still being a rather new operation but I hope things improve sooner rather than later.  It's a great place to bring out-of-towners and with the holidays coming up, I want to be able to show off this gem to my visiting friends."}
{"text":"A hipster joint with a friendly vibe to families. The local parks department runs this river front bar/bistro with a great outdoor patio that wheelchairs can navigate. I was waiting for Leslie Knope and her staff to come out and serve--but the staff was ultra-friendly and very professional. It was a great place to welcome nightfall and have our dinner as the crew teams when up and down the waterway."}
{"text":"Can't beat the setting. On the river. Beautiful building, open airy inside, patio and large fireplace out. Freighters, pleasure craft, kayaks and racing sculls from the CLE paddle club next door.   Sat at the bar. Chaos on a busy but not crazy evening.  A nice and earnest but overwhelmed staff. If management is good they will staff better and get better and 4-5 stars follow.   Fish tacos very nice. Decent looking food around. Complicated drinks (want a pantry with your Bloody Mary?  Pickle?) a real chore, so waiting for your soda or that guys beer may take 10-15 minutes. Forgotten orders. Calling out looking for who ordered what. Nice crowd so no problems but that can't last.   I'll be back with kayaks and hope things are better!"}
{"text":"Planned an adult night out w friends at Merwins Wharf. Several of the couples had never been to MW so this was their first time.   They don't take reservations, even for large groups. I went early and put a request in for a large outside table. I had 45 mins to kill and grabbed a drink at the bar. Overall the bar service was very slow. Seems like the bartenders cannot multitask well. It comes down to training.   All couples arrived and we were all seated fairly quickly. I had an open tab at the bar and went back in to finish the drink order I started and to close the tab. When the waiter came to the table and was told we were getting drink a from the bar (and not from him) he seemed disturbed by that. Get over it.   Table service was very slow. I don't know if the waiter was having a bad night, pissed we ordered drinks at the bar (we ordered plenty more from him through the night), didn't like our group, didn't like his job or was just generally not pleasant. Regardless, he did not represent MW's best service experience.   The first time he served beer to the table, he poured them into the glass too quickly and too full, so that when he set them down (he did this twice) the beer overflowed all over the place. He didn't seem to mind and left. Stunned, we had to walk over to the bar to get a stack of napkins to clean up a mess as he was not coming back to do it.   When he spoke he was abrupt and \"forced friendly\".    Food came out reasonably quick. Entre' portions seemed a bit on the smaller side. Prices were ok.   Would I come here again?  Yes. The location is amazing and totally the perfect place to be on a warm summer night. Metroparks has a real gem location here. They need to focus on training proper service, both table side and bar service.   What would i do differently?  I would be aware of slow service. And I would make sure we had table service that was actually friendly and timely. I wouldn't bring a large group of friends here again, knowing it is embarrassing to have such poor service at a place I recommended we go to."}
{"text":"Went with husband and baby at 1pm unknowing of $18 brunch for scrambled eggs and other items we were not interested in. Decided to wait until 2 to get reg menu. My husband went in to put our names in at 1:30 to ensure we got a patio table and the hostess said no need to put your name in, there is no wait. Just come back in 15 mins. So we came back and there was a 30 min wait for patio. I asked why she wouldn't have just taken his name when he went in! Now our baby is hungry and fussy. Leaving, never coming back, and telling our friends."}
{"text":"The Metroparks get an A+ for picking out and designing this location. They food is pretty good, if they aren't all out of it. I've gone 3 different times and each time they are out of at least 3-4 entree items, which is almost 25% of their smaller menu. They really need to work on their inventory control. Additionally, the majority of their wait and bar servers act like they just started. They don't know what's on the menu or how to make their signature drinks. They really need to work on their training protocols."}
{"text":"Food service was greatly improved from the last time. Came out in a timely manner.  Overall food was good.   But the bar experience lowered my rating. Prior to being seated we went up to the bar to order drinks. Wanted 2 wines and a water. Male bartender (no name tags) came up - we asked a question about one of the wines. He didn't know - female bartender was there he asked her and she answered. He left us to talk to a friend that came in the bar ~ so we were ditched. She stared to wait on us, poured one glass of wine. Went to the other side, thought she was getting the other wine. NOPE! she started to wait on someone else. Seriously?  Since all I wanted was water, and I couldn't get anyone to help. I ended up taking a water pitcher and glass from the bar and walked away. Left my friend who was annoyed and letting the manager (?) know.  Who listened and did nothing to rectify it. The bar experience was completely lacking in customer performance. Baffled once again."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out on an Summer evening. Cool Breezes, green space, boats traveling up and down the river. Casual and relaxing, with indoor and outdoor seating we think this is a hidden gem! The drinks are simple - no extensive wine list or craft cocktail menu. The food is pub style but this is where Merwin's excels. We had fish tacos, the HUGE bavarian pretzel (best ever), the Cuban sandwich and the angus burger. Everyone at our table was happy with the quality, taste and freshness. The food wasn't amazing-we-must-come-back, bit it was a great night out. The bartender where we sat for an hour waiting for the table had no personality and the table service was horrendously S L O W, but with the atmosphere we were all very happy customers.  Note that the place closes promptly at 10pm as it is in the Park! We were ushered out right at 10pm..... The service was the downside...."}
{"text":"We came here on a weeknight, so it wasn't overly crowded. There were no outside tables available, so they sat us on the edge right by the patio. Total bonus because it felt like we were outside with the open concept they have going on, AND we still felt the air conditioning!  Service was great from start to finish, and it's a really fun summer atmosphere. I don't know if I can really see myself coming here in cold weather, it seems more like a summer place.  The food was excellent, though I think the prices are a little high which is why they only get 4 stars. I had the cuban and my husband had the fish tacos. Both were really great. I also upgraded to fries and added a side salad and it was worth it. Again though, the upgrade for fries was a little much in my opinion.   I think the Metroparks did and are doing a great job with this place!"}
{"text":"What a great and fun place. Right on the river with a great view of downtown from it's spacious and comfortable patio with two fireplaces.  Inside is comfortable and open with a large bar as the centerpiece.  The detailing is exactly what you would expect from The Metroparks. There are historic pictures and information about Cleveland scattered around the walls.  Very fun and interesting.   They have a full bar with several rotating taps and a decent bottled beer selection. Prices on drinks are reasonable. The bartenders were friendly and helpful and while they were slammed last night due to a large special event going on, they were professional and fast.    We sat at the bar and had a great view of the kitchen and the food coming out.  The presentation of food is very pleasing.  The menu is small but covers appetizers with a pretzel the size of platter to mussels and sandwiches and burgers.   We had the Freighter Frites as an appetizer.   They were not your ordinary frites. They had chorizo, real cheese melted on the fries and lime sour cream topped with some house made pickled red onions. Fresh, hot and tasty.  After that we ordered the Lake Erie Perch Sliders and the a.m. burger.  Both were large portions, cooked perfectly and tasted great.  I would higher recommend the perch sliders served on a cornmeal bun with sriracha tartar sauce and house made pickles. Since we had the fries as our appetizer we opted for the house salads as our sides.  The salads were not too small and had a great variety of greens and toppings.  The dressings we chose were artichoke balsamic vinaigrette and honey poppy seed.  Both were fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is all about the ambience and outdoor seating. It is located right on the river channel running through the city and you have prime viewing for all the large ships and barges coming through. The outdoor patio is lined with white lights and there is a fire pit to cuddle up to on a chilly night. The food is ok its nothing to shout about but it's decent. It's also a government run agency because it is run by metro parks which I found interesting. Either way it's a great outdoor venue and would be a fun spot to check out especially in the summer. It's also family friendly with seating for large parties and a path for the kids to run and play on."}
{"text":"We stopped in to have a quick happy hour snack and are glad we did.  Really beautiful patio, right on the river, but we sat inside to enjoy the a/c.  We plan on going back to enjoy the patio soon.  The server quickly got our orders and food out quickly to accommodate our tight schedule.    The 3 of us split the vega-nachos, burning river beef sliders, and a summer berry salad.  The nacho toppings were very and tasty, but not quite enough for all the chips.  Had to order an extra side of the garlicky, tasty black bean hummus.  The flour tortilla chips also came with guacamole, salsa and pickled jalepenos.  We held the olives.  Those burning river sliders were spicy even with the Siracha soaked onions on the side, but we like some spice.  Four came in the order.  Lastly, the summer berry salad was tasty too.  We opted for the garlic herb vinaigrette dressing and that was a good choice.   Tip: If you want to get a seat, go early as it was full by the time we were leaving. No reservations here."}
{"text":"Great place on the river.  Outdoor seating when nice.   The pretzels are huge and wonderful.  Cobb salad was great.  Great service!"}
{"text":"I have been to Merwin's Wharf many times. I have to say mostly because of the location and not the food or service. I love sitting outside watching the boats go by. The food is always decent but nothing to rave about. The service is always friendly but slow.   However, the reason for the 5 star rating is because today I brought my kids and grandkids for the Santa Brunch. We have been to several over the the past few years and this, by far, exceeds them all. My expectations of these events are not very high, but Merwins did it right.   The food was great, cheese blintzes and cheesy grits were delicious. Food was hot and even the scrambled eggs were hot and not rubbery as at most buffets. They knocked it out of the park. I liked the relaxed atmosphere and authentic Santa. Spoiler alert:  I think he may have been the real one right from the North Pole.   Add in the balloon toys, face painting and magic show and you have the makings of a magical Santa Brunch.   Great job Merwin's!"}
{"text":"The location, decor, and scenery is great. The rest falls flat. The staff is all middle-aged, but must be new to the industry. I ordered a margarita and watched the bartender pour margarita mix into a  glass with ice. I don't think she realized that the mix is non-alcoholic and the drink required her to add tequila. I didn't have a chance to talk to her about it because after fifteen minutes of my drink sitting in the rail and my girlfriend waiting to order something we gave up and left. Empty drinks and begging faces were all that were to be found.  I understand being overwhelmed by volume, but a mediocre bartender should have been comfortable handling that crowd with an individual wait time of less than a couple minutes."}
{"text":"I really do love Merwin's Wharf but just wish they'd step up their food a notch. It's often ok but if they really took advantage of their location and beautiful setting I think they could really capitalize. I had the fish tacos and they smelled really fishy the minute the plate hit the table. I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt however and took one bite and they were extremely spicy. I think the Chef attempted to mask the fish smell with the spices which wasn't cool. I sent the plate back and got a burger which was really good. I liked that it wasn't soggy. Seriously Merwin's, please consider some improvement to your food! Many of my friends like the restaurant but say the food is just \"Ok\"."}
