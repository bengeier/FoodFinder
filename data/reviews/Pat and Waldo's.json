{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today.  Had the Ricotta with Spinach and Sausage.  Got my order to go.  Food was at a good temp after a 2 block walk.  Nice portion size, good flavor and a couple slices of garlic bread. Price was average for lunch these days, so no complaints there.  I only gave 3 stars since this was my first visit.  I liked the food, restaurant and staff were nice.  Will try again soon and definitely sharing my experience with co-workers."}
{"text":"I really love the uniqueness of this place. We decided to go here for lunch today and I really glad we did. I really enjoyed the Ramen soup I ordered. It was really flavorful, nice amount of chicken, great amount of noodles and I loved the flavor of the broth. My friend ordered pasta which I tried someone and it was really tasty and the way they served it on the plate you would have thought you were at a 4 star restaurant. The bread,looked really tasty they served with it. The chicken on her pasta was shredded so it was like you got some in almost every bite and it had just the right amount of sauce. This place is definitely a must try. I can't wait to go back and try something else. The prices are really reasonable. The servers were really great also."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying a new restaurant downtown. I had one of their ramen bowls which had great flavor. I was disappointed in the amount they give you in the bowl. It was half full and they give you plastic small spoons to eat with. They need to have different utensils to eat this soup. The sides were overpriced in my opinion . They didn't have any hot sauce. I was hungry after I left .... I will try again in a couple of months."}
{"text":"I was expecting this place to be more along the lines of noodles and co., but I was SO off. 

My pasta was cooked perfectly, and the portion size was excellent. The presentation of all of the food that we ordered was beautiful- it felt more like being in a highly-rated restaurant than an order and go kind of place. I had pasta Amatriciana, which was one of my favorites when I lived in Rome, and this was on par with what I had in Italy. We also ordered a caprese salad and the salami board, all of which was fantastic. In addition, we asked for a red wine suggestion, and the wine we received was delicious. The staff were very friendly and helpful. This is my new favorite spot to eat. Great prices for very tasty food, and a cool atmosphere. I can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience! We were so surprised this place was not packed with such good food and good service. We happened to be around the area and our kids were hungry, so we gave this place a try. 

The food presentation was so nice. They look exactly the same as the pictures shown on the LCD. This restaurant has an Italian section and Japanese section. We ordered food from both to try out different things. All of the food we ordered tasted fresh and delicious. I particularly like the agedashi tofu.

We didn't expect any service because it looked like once you ordered and got the food, you are on your own. Surprisingly, the owner served us and brought us extra plates. The chefs checked on us about whether we got all the orders right. Maybe since it was not busy and we had two young kids, so we got extra attention. 

My toddler girl was so fussy upon arrival but once she started eating, she became the happy camper. Both of my kids are picky in terms of the taste of food, not the type of food. My kindergarten son gave approval to this place at the end by making the comment:\"we can come back here!\""}
{"text":"Enjoyed the meatballs and the Pappardelle ala Bolognese.  Friends we were with loved the Ramen. Great decor!"}
{"text":"\"A-Ok\" I think sums up Pat and Waldo's/Otakumen pretty well. Stumbled into this restaurant by chance and was impressed by the fun red chairs and modern decor. It is also unique in that it is like a mini cafeteria with two restaurants in one room; half of the menu is Italian inspired, while the other half is Japanese. Finally decided on the Shoyu ramen bowl and the Miso Togarashi bowl.  I enjoyed the bamboo in the Shoyu and the overall flavor of the soup was decent, but I felt it was lacking that bolder, richer flavored broth.  Same went for the Miso, which we were told would be very spicy. While it packed a bit of a punch, it too could have been both spicier and bolder in flavor.  While I will probably not return for ramen, I would come back to try the shishito pepper appetizer, as well as some of the pasta options on Pat and Waldo's side."}
{"text":"So my boys drag me downtown...I'm hungry & feeling adventurous...upon arriving we are greeted nicely, as with most small new spots, awkwardness is the name of the game I guess. It's clean & nicely appointed, don't understand the TV screen thing, but whatever.. However, we pushed thru & ordered basically spaghetti & meatballs or Pomodoro. It was probably the best I've ever had in phoenix. Perfectly seasoned...the drawback...no bread. Bread would have gotten more stars. WHO SERVES PASTA WITH NO BREAD? I'd def go back, but take out fo sho so I can have bread with my pasta!"}
{"text":"I'll try the place again because it seems to have potential and the ramen broth was good flavor (although the noodles were a little overdone).  Lasagna was not good at all- watery, no tomato flavor) and served with 2 small slices of focaccia bread that wasn't really any good either.  The server was nice but overall I'd give service a 3... We are used to being greeted like family and treated so great at other places we frequent downtown. And it is HOT inside- we were sweating throughout the meal they need to do something to ventilate better"}
{"text":"I stopped by Pat & Waldo's on opening day and got what I was told was the chef's specialty -- papparedelle noodles with a bolognese sauce. It was incredible! If I had one small critique it would be that my first few bites seemed over-salted, but I quickly got lost in the creamy tomato and meat sauce and fluffy noodles."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to this place opening for quite some time and was honestly disappointed in the quality of the food.  The pasta was just ok...nothing special and the meatballs were almost inedible.  My husband was hoping to enjoy the ramen, but they had sold out the day before, so no such luck.  I think we'll see if this place is around a few months from now and then give it another shot."}
{"text":"With a group of 8 having amazing lunch at Pat and Waldo. I visit a lot of restaurants but this one has been the favorite if he week. Amazing food!  Awesome Service!"}
{"text":"I ordered that Pomodoro and honestly I cant tell you it was pretty horrible the meatballs were very overcooked and dry, the sauce was incredibly bland and the portion size was like 2 bites. The only half way decent thing was the actual past itself which was average. For just under $11 definitely not worth it I wouldn't have paid $5 for this."}
{"text":"This restaurant shares its space with Otakumen, almost like a mini food court with two options. The only reason we tried it (good menu placement) was because it was on the reverse side of the Otakumen menu. My sister and brother in law had visited to eat ramen but when we were unsatisfied with our ramen (I didn't even finish mine) We saw the alfredo on the Pat and Waldo's menu. I LOVE alfredo, this alfredo had mushrooms and chicken... all things awesome, esp when combined. We ordered it and it came almost instantly. It looked and smelled delicious! Then the taste part is when everything went wrong. The alfredo sauce was anything but exciting, the chicken... ugh, the chicken, it was as if it were once chicken jerky and they soaked it in water for 20 minutes to rehydrate it and just tossed it in with our pasta. It was tough, stringy, just all around unappetizing. I did let the host know and her response was \"oh, it's like that because it's cooked and then pulled apart.\" I just stared at her reply because shredded or pulled chicken isn't tough. I can confidently say that Olive Garden Alfredo dish leaves Pat and Waldo's Alfredo dish in the dust."}
{"text":"Rough start. It's a madhouse and doesn't seem ready to open. To start we had to wait in line half an hour, and then after dealing with two different employees, I was finally allowed to order. It took the cashier 15 minutes to figure out how to plug in our order. THEN they tell us that their credit card machine isn't working and they only accept cash. Who carries a bunch of cash on them? It's the 21st-century. Why didn't someone tell us this during the 40 minute wait? Like the hostess?  Or put up a sign? God knows one of us could have gone to the bank and back twice during that wait! Seems pretty basic.  Will probably give them another chance in a month or so but geez, talk about not ready to open.  The stuff was restaurant 101."}
{"text":"Had both sides of the restaurant and they are pretty tasty. The Ramen is quite authentic from my Japan days with tender pork and a uniquely tasty broth. Garlic is the key here I think. The potstickers are delicious. On the Italian side the meatballs are divine and the Alfredo is tasty. The portions are a tad small for the price, but it's really a gourmet type place at a reasonable price. Chinese buffet it ain't so it's really quality over quantity."}
{"text":"Best Ramon in Phoenix. This place is a true gem. It's open late and the people working there are so much fun. 100% coming here Everytime I need some ramen!"}
{"text":"I don't do soft openings and it's probably best I missed this one.  I arrived at noon and there's a sign on the door stating they can only accept cash today.  I ordered pappardelle with sausage from a very pleasant lady, waited about 10 minutes and was presented with a dish that had no visible signs of Italian sausage in it. The kitchen staff was very disorganized. The sausage was ground so fine it wasn't noticeable, and the pasta was overcooked to the point of being leathery.  The pleasant lady offered to remake it but I refused. Perhaps I'll wait a few more weeks before going back so they can work the bugs out."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good food. I had the Spicy Ramen & my friend had spaghetti & meatballs. You can see the kitchen prep your food and it was nice seeing the smiling cook taking pride in his plating and cleaning up the plate with a napkin for presentation. One of few places open around downtown late in the evening. Walked by it several times looking for it though because it says Noodle Bar outside and not Pat & Waldos anywhere."}
{"text":"I stopped in because Harumi Sushi no longer serves dinner options, only sushi. Upon entering the restaurant I was greeted by a nice woman. After glancing over the menu, I chose the lasagna, which comes with sourdough bread. I wasn't in a dine-in mood so I took the order togo. The restaurant was clean and I only waited about ten minutes to receive the meal. However, the clean environment and short wait time cannot make up for the bad taste of the food. The lasagna was horrible!! It taste extremely bad and I don't know if it is just me or not but when did lasagna start being made with carrots? Moral of the story is, I will not be returning again!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

The portion to price here is not bad at all, but just know that if you just get one order of pasta, you will leave a little hungry.  That's the trade-off.

This side of the restaurant is light years ahead of the ramen side.  (See review for Otakumen.)    The noodles came out al dente, they were a little over-sauced.  This place was exactly what I expected from an Italian joint downtown catering to the lunchtime crowd - decently priced meal that comes out pretty quickly and tastes just fine.  

No rave reviews here, but no major knocks either.  I might be giving this place more of a boost than I should just in comparison to the trainwreck ramen it served me."}
{"text":"Delicious and great price. Their chefs are great. I worked with a gentle by the name of Jesus. Very polite and courteous. Definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"Great place as far as atmosphere, food and prices! Angel hair pasta with the meatballs was amazing! Definitely recommend this place to all my friends and family and I will be going back for more on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"I think I'll wait a few more weeks to come back. The noodle place was closed at 12 because they sold out. It looked like no one was managing the place. Pasta was just allright. I asked for bread and never got it. I'll try it again but they have a lot of kinks to work out."}
{"text":"As meh as the ramen is at otakumen, the pasta from pat and waldo's was actually pretty tasty. I tried the Alfredo with chicken and mushrooms... This thing was rich and super garlicky. The portion size was decent for the price (under 10$ ftw!). I would come back and have this again and would like to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"Late night food that actually tastes great....what could be better!?

I have had both the ramen and the spaghetti and meatballs (pomodoro) and both were delicious! The ramen was perfectly spiced with crispy pork belly. The second time I went, I didn't think the italian could be any better, but it somehow was. The meatballs and sauce were just right.

Whats more, the dishes are all under $10, and the service is great and fast.

Can't wait to come back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I ordered the fettuccine, after trying to figure out the menu, sigh.  I've worked in several Italian eateries/restaurants so I'm pretty familiar with  consistent and quality Italian food, which this was not. The noodles were rubbery and I can tell you that's from being over cooked and left out too long. Very disappointed. The carrots were fine but that's not saying much. I didn't finish my meal.  The place was clean which is good, the music was great, but really, it's the food that's supposed to speak volumes about your reputation and it definitely didn't. The manager Debbie, was very courteous and pleasant. But I won't be going back."}
