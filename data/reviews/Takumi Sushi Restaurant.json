{"text":"The complimentary salad with the meal was the smallest I've ever seen at a Japanese restaurant. The sushi boat we ordered was mediocre. Nothing to brag about,  it's a simple plain Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for the all-you-can-eat lunch here. Outside the sign says $11.99 but when you receive the menu it says $13.99. It's only a two dollar difference but that pretty much indicated how the rest of our experience would be; things felt cheap.   Lunch ends at 4 so they took their time serving us to basically wait out the clock. Our first order took half an hour to receive and there were items missing. We only had time to order twice because they took so long talking our order and bringing the food, again items we had ordered were missing the second time.  The food was not tasty. Most thing we ordered we did not like, even the simple items like avocado and cucumber maki. The tuna maki was so terrible my boyfriend could not handle more than two bites; it was tasteless and had been dyed red.  There were many servers hanging out at the front of the restaurant laughing very loudly, which would not have annoyed me if we weren't waiting to have our order taken.  We both left unsatisfied, which is so wrong for one of these. That's like leaving a buffet hungry. Still on the hunt for the perfect all-you-can-eat sushi!"}
{"text":"Used to be one of our favorite sushi places in this neighborhood but in the past 8 months, the quality has really deteriorated. Don't know why, perhaps change of management/owner."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi place in Toronto thus far. Adorable, sweet servers, yummy green tea to sip while you wait, and reasonably priced. This is the one I always return to. They deliver as well, if I read the menu correctly.."}
{"text":"When this restaurant first opened a few years ago it was soooo good! At that time, the owner himself worked behind the counting slicing and presenting a myriad of delicious sushi and sashimi in mouth watering portion sizes. I was addicted to this place for a long period of time (2-3 times per week).  Then one day, they decided to offer all-you-can eat to keep up with neighbouring competition (Sushi Sky). At this point, the owner was generating enough revenue to be able to hire other front-of-house sushi chefs. Consequently, portion sizes decreased and quality completely disappeared.  I recently revisited this place for old times sake and decided to try their all-you-can eat option and I also ordered from their main menu on a separate occasion. Ewww, so gross! Soggy dumplings, tiny portions of fish, tiny maki rolls with so little rice it could barely form a roll, and so few choices.  The all-you-can eat menu has very few options to choose from versus the main menu that probably won't be much better either at this point. The sushi chefs are so accustomed to serving malformed maki rolls and slivers of fish that anything ordered from the main menu is presented in much the same way as the lazy and minimal all-you-can eat style.  This place went from everything I want to eat to everything I wish to avoid."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dined here for the first time tonight because we had purchased one of those group buy coupons (shhh!  don't tell my regular sushi place I cheated!).  We went all out and ordered a sushi boat that let us sample a nice range of their sushi and sashimi.  Everything was delicious, and the salmon and red dragon rolls were especially good. The dressing on the salad that came with the meal was also  better than the standard sushi house dressing, and the miso soup was pretty standard but good.  Service was great and prompt with hot tea flowing the whole time.  I left feeling full and happy after an overall great experience."}
{"text":"I bought a deal for this resto fro only 3 bucks and after eating there, I wish I had bought more.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was.  I even told the chef so when I left.  It was crowded and I didn't have a reservation but the served me anyway and I had to wait a bit for my food and some confusion as to what I could order with my voucher, but not too, too long though.  I haven't had time to go back, but I think about it often when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from Takumi, probably the worst food I had in ages. Miso tasted like piss and the tuna rolls had nearly any rice on them and the fish was mushy. I took an Imodium just in case..."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in Toronto. Service is not taht great but then again its a sushi place, and sushi places hardly have great service unless youre paying more than 40 bucks. This place is definitely underrated, all the folks that have given it bad reviews, GO THEIR AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant about the third star, but decided it was earned through the cheap prices and specials that this place has.  Plus, service when dining is quick.  Overall food is average, nothing amazing but you'll have your sushi cravings temporarily satiated.  I have ordered take out numerous times from here (they prepared the orders quite quickly) and have also dined in for their AYCE lunch special, which is about $12.99/person but it does not include any sashimi.   I would come back here again to get a temporary sashimi fix, and with the prices they have, not much to complain about as long as your sushi connoisseur hat is left at home!"}
{"text":"Decent, very good sashimi. Everything was very fresh.  It arrived on time. Nothing special to write home about but definitely a good place to go. High quality yet basic. Will return if in area again. Not my favourite spicy rolls yet still good."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for a late lunch. We were super hungry and it was cold outside, so this was the first sushi place we saw.   We ordered some starters and a couple of maki.   The starters were: spring rolls, sashimi and deep fried breaded chicken. The spring rolls were small and alright. They were served warm, but nothing special. The sashimi was fresh, but the cut was too thick for my liking. The deep fried breaded chicken was good, but the waitress forgot to bring the ginger sauce that it was supposed to be served with.   We ordered the mango and smoked salmon maki. This was interesting. I am not sure if I would order it again, but it was good overall. We also ordered the cripsy spicy salmon with wasabi mayo. This was really good. Loved this! 3 stars just for this! :)  Overall, this place was just OK. I've had better sushi at other places, but this it the spot. Service could have been better. I find they tend to forget about you when u sit in those enclosed booths.  Would I return? Maybe, but on a warm day I would keep on walking to find another sushi place."}
{"text":"Whose lunch special reigns supreme?  Yonge/Wellesley has no shortage of Japanese restaurants offering cheap lunch specials.  To be honest... they all sort of taste similar. It's not great sushi but hey, you wanted cheap food.  However, Takumi has one of the largest selection of specials.  Lots of bento boxes and specialty rolls.  You can add a salmon hand roll for $2.  The bentos are filling.    Specials come with miso soup. The salad that nobody really eats. For $9 I had salmon teriyaki, veggie and shrimp tempura, a couple of California rolls, two spring rolls.  No, it's not spectacular food.  But it's the middle of the day and I'm hungry and this place is decent.  Works for me! =)"}
{"text":"We were looking for a light snack before heading out for a late dinner.  We decided on sushi and made it just in time for their happy hour.  Beautiful decor - creative and modern.  Great prices for sushi.  They weren't busy on a Friday afternoon, but it was still difficult to get our waitress' attention at times. The rolls were a little bigger than I prefer (I like them bite-size, not gigantic).  The miso soup and Japanese salad were pretty standard."}
{"text":"Horrible service and average, mediocre Toronto sushi. I got the all you can eat for lunch and got the Boston roll, which is supposed to contain shrimp, salmon, avocado and cucumber. That is what their menu says. I guess to save costs they just made it with cucumber and shrimp. I sent  that boring roll back, and the waitress seemed shocked. lol. No one came to check up on me, or offer more tea or water. I had to flag the server down, who was busy having a conversation at the back of the restaurant, and go to the front to pay since she never brought me the bill. Debit machine didn't work either so I had to go to a bank to take out cash. Very inconvenient.  I will not return. Very rarely do I not tip but in this case I did not."}
{"text":"Not sure what everyone is talking about. When I went the service was impeccable, although they did forget an item. (However we didn't write it down and simply asked the waitress to get us it) since we went for all you can eat. However, for around $7 you can get 16 pieces + some other things without all you can each which is great. The food was pretty good. The shrimp tempura needs a bit more flavour. I'd come here again. We actually didn't finish much of the all you can eat(ordered too much) and took it out. Like any place, they charge for the extra bits left, and surprisingly, it was extremely cheap. Overall the food, service is great, and worth the prices."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to sushi restaurant. After all the walk in special is only $4.99+tax for 2 rolls (16 pieces) and a bottle of water with a variety of rolls to choose from - spicy salmon, spicy tuna, california roll, crunch crab, teriyaki chicken, sweet potato, etc.   The last time I had sushi from this restaurant I swung by on my lunch break and picked up a walk-in special (spicy salmon and crunch crab); my order was ready within 10 mins. After getting back to work I ate my lunch and continued on with my day. Throughout the afternoon I began to feel light headed and sick to my stomach. By the time I got home after work I was in the washroom throwing up for most of the night and had a terrible fever. I had to call in sick the next day - and spend most of the my day in the washroom.  I've experienced food poisoning before but nothing as horrible as that. Sad to say I haven't been back since and probably won't ever go back. I guess you get the quality you pay for!"}
{"text":"Only had one experience here, it was takeout, and I felt it was subpar. I only had it the only time, so I cant say that its always bad, just that I thought it was bad. I remember they put tomatoes in a dish, that in Japan does not have tomatoes  I remember thinking the food was neither authentic nor good"}
{"text":"Nothing remotely exciting or exceptional, unless you count having a menu item called the \"Faily Monster\" (I haven't tried it yet).  I wouldn't dine in here considering the other options nearby. But the take-out special is a great on-the-go option amongst the 193,804 sushi spots that line the area. For less than $6 cash, you get two homely but fresh rolls chosen from a respectable list of eight (e.g. California, sweet potato and avocado, spicy tuna/salmon, etc.) and overstuffed with flavourless tempura bits for girth. Plus one inconsequential bottle of water, which I was told I could swap for soup for an extra dollar. Your lazy dinner problems solved."}
{"text":"I love the $4.99 takeout cash only special! It comes with 2 types of rolls (8 rolls per type, 16 rolls in total) and a water bottle. Perfect for a quick grab & go meal, study snack and post workout protein meal. Very close to the Ryerson campus, just north of College Station. Not the most top quality sushi I've tasted (you pay for what you get and top quality buttery fish sushi would cost a lot), but for $5 it's satisfactory for sushi cravings on a budget, especially for a student. S/O to my friend Derrick for telling me about this place. Defs coming back and telling people! :)"}
{"text":"I always get the same thing when i come here - seafood ramen. Its the same price as if you get a beef or chicken ramen, but the seafood comes with everything! shrimp, crab sticks, mussle, scallop, grilled salmon, etc etc.   The other things on the menu are mediocre. Tried the AYCE sushi once and it wasn't too good. took a long time to arrive."}
{"text":"Made the dreadful mistake of trying their \"All You Can Eat Special\" (13.99 Lunch & 17.99 Dinner). Sashimi was not part of the deal and the sushi selection was limited and not expertly prepared, with the rice tasting over-boiled, heavy and falling off the fish. The gyoza dumplings were greasy and the minced filling feeble. The sukiyaki that was listed on the menu as being served in a hot pot came instead in a plastic bowl and the broth was exceedingly salty, as was the udon soup I ordered. I know it's Yonge street fare and I shouldn't be expecting high-quality cuisine, but with all the competition around, why give patrons a reason not to return?"}
{"text":"Takumi is our go-to for quick cheap takeout. You can't go wrong with the cash-only takeout special. You get 32 pieces (choice of 4 if you get a double order, which we do) for precisely $11.38.   The sushi is passable - but the deal cannot be beat. We wouldn't eat in when there are way better options in the neighborhood (Wow! Sushi on Charles is so much better for just a fraction more).   My GF and I always go with the California, Avocado and Sweet Potato, Spicy Tuna, and Spicy Salmon."}
{"text":"Takumi, takumi, takumi.  I came here yesterday for the 2nd time because I was in the area, super hungover and dying for some grub.    Sushi is my hangover food okay?  We had the Lunch AYCE - 13.99 (a bit pricey, since in the 'hill its about 11.99 with waaaaaaaaaay more variey...ahem HOCKEY...aherm)   The service is excellent, which is nice. A lot of times when you go to AYCE Sushi places, the service sucks. But here, it was one lady running all of the tables (There were about 12 tables and 8 booths...the booths were too small for me and my friend so we opted for a table)  We ordered:  1. Salads - Wakame and Avocado Tomato Salad. - The wakame was your standard, I think that all these AYCE places just get this pre-packaged. The Avocado and Tomato salad was great! Thick slices of Avocado covered in sesame. The tomatoes were almost non-existant.   2. Apps- Spicy Chicken, Gyoza, Spring Rolls, Japanese Pancake. Everything was nothing spectacular, except the Spicy Chicken. It was like crack. We couldnt scarf it down fast enough!!  3. Rolls - We ordered too many, but they were okay. We got the Beef Teriyaki, the Chicken Teriyaki, The Philly, The Rock N Roll, The Dynamite nad the Red Dragon.   The salmon on top of the Red Dragon didnt taste that fresh...it wasn't no hockey sushi thats for sure.  4. Udon - Shrimp Tempura with A bowl of Udon Soup....all i could taste was over salted seaweed...We couldn't eat it.  Since we had about 20 pieces of sushi left, we asked them to pack it up. Wasnt too bad, she only charged us 4 dollaz.  Sad-ness List.  1. NO SHRIMP TEMPURA ON THE MENU. WTF?!?!?!? 2. Desert was only mango/green tea/ red bean. My friend was sad because he wanted chocolate. 3. WHERE THE HELL IS THE FREAKING SHRIMP TEMPURA?!?!? 4. I really can't get over the fact that there was no shrimp tempz.   I probs will come back hungover one day, as it's right next to my friend's place.."}
{"text":"I shall keep this as brief as I can. My dining experiences here have been overall good. The AYCE option is quite cheap $11.99 lunch/ $17.99 dinner.The fish was fresh and of standard quality, the hot food arrived hot and tasted yummy, the maki was substandard as is all too common @AYCE sushi in Toronto. The cold service I received by the waitresses here upon multiple visits with different parties including once with friends, once with family, and a couple times alone were equally as off-putting as the next. Had it not been for the frosty waitresses I would have been a fan, especially for the sashimi on a $17.99 AYCE dinner menu"}
{"text":"Waitresses looked dead, behaved accordingly. Service was so-so. Food was so-so as well."}
{"text":"Pretty suspect quality at this place. The rolls fell apart when you picked them up. The sushi chef does not know how to make good sushi rolls."}
{"text":"I should have noticed there was something wrong when I had to ask if they were opened. This is never, EVER, a good signal.   The only waitress was looking me with that bored face, like \"oh no... more work on a friday....\", and I suddenly understood why the restaurant was so empty on a friday afternoon.   She took about 5 minutes to offer me a menu and serve me the worst green tea on earth. I decided to order something without fish... the \"vegetarian bento\".  Well, after a long, long wait the only eadible part of the bento was the miso soup. I tried the spring rolls, but they were basically deep-fried pastry with nothing inside. The rice looked like a week old, and the california rolls had nothing but rice. All the deep-fried vegetables had this sad yesterday look. I never touched them.   The bento was supposed to include some fruits as dessert. When I asked for the bill - after having to SCREAM for the waitress - she brought me \"fruits\" - which turned out to be one slice of melon.  And I suppose I should eat the melon using chopsticks, as she didn't bring any kind of fork/knife with the melon.   I just paid - and left no tip, just the melon. Worst japanese I've ever been in my life. Pretty sad place."}
{"text":"The sushi here used to be really nice and fresh, but I think they must have lost their chef sometime within the past month and a bit because the last time I went, the sushi tasted awful. There was a period where they were randomly closed for a few weeks with no notice on the door, so that must have been when they lost their sushi chef. I had gotten consistently good sushi before my last visit, and I was really saddened by the fact that the quality had taken such a nosedive with their current chef."}
{"text":"After a morning of helping my brother out at Ikea and moving furniture, we came here for a quick lunch before the obligatory assembly portion of our afternoon. Takumi is located just north of Wood Street on the west side of Yonge Street.  On a Sunday just after lunchtime, the restaurant wasn't very busy and we were seated right away. We ended up going with the $13.99 AYCE lunch special. I got a green salad, spicy salmon rolls, spicy butterfish rolls, some avocado, salmon and butterfish sushi and possibly something else.  First of all, we were served water when we arrived, tepid and room temperature. I cant' stand tepid water but I was thirsty so it did the job. I wanted to get a drink as the AYCE menu specifies you can get a pop with your meal but the waitress didn't bother to ask and ran away before I could call her back.   Then our food arrived. I have NEVER in my LIFE seen a spicy salmon roll that looked as disgusting and unappetizing as the ones the had here. Imagine a traditional seaweed wrapped piece of rice with mushed up salmon mixed in spicy sauce on top of it, spilling over the top of the sushi. It looked like my cat just threw it up. I ate it, since I didn't want to pay any extra, but the texture was just gross and I had a hard time finishing it even though the taste was okay. The butterfish rolls... something was off about those bad boys. In fact all the sushi I had that included raw fish seemed off. I'm surprised I didn't take ill after eating here. I noticed after dipping my sushi rolls into my soy sauce that the soy sauce itself was watered down. And noticeably so. It was so light I did a double take. Either they've watered the soy sauce down or they've gotten a super light sauce and put it into the regular bottles.  I suppose you can only expect so much for AYCE sushi at this place but my brother really likes it here... and I figured out why. If you don't eat the fish, you're fine to eat here. Get the actual sushi with raw fish in it and you should beware. All he eats is veggie rolls and whatnot so he has no idea that the sushi itself is awful.  Service was poor, inattentive and I felt like I was unwelcome. Will never come back and I suggest you don't waste your time even considering coming here when there's better sushi just around the corner."}
{"text":"I'm a little biased here.  I live around the corner from this place...and I go here every thursday because I don't feel like cooking.  Don't ask why a thursday....I just do.  I was there the first day they opened and still go...  You know everyone has that restaurant where they know your order, they know your name and they do a little something extra for you, well this is my place.    The lady who always serves me is so sweet and very nice (I actually see her out of the restaurant sometimes and she always starts a conversation with me).  The master chef always makes me a little something extra because I'm there once a week. However, there was a waitress there once that was not the best she spilled miso soup all over my friend and when she came to clean it up after 5 minutes of it sitting there she spilled more on my friend....I dont see her there anymore though.  They did comp my meal that day because of that incident.  Sometimes they bring me free apps. Yay free food!  The food is good and very fresh. I usually get the black cod bento box, with saba sushi on the side or the chirashi don.  My boyfriend is less of a sushi fan so he gets the katsu don and I have tried this and it's AMAZING!   Don't go during lunch hour unless you have to it gets very busy!  Thursday and Friday nights are usually busy as well....     Cost: 2 people, 1 apps, 2 mains, $27 Food quality: 4.5/5 Food quantity: 5/5 Service: 4.5/5  Would I Go Again: See you in 5 days!"}
{"text":"The first time I tried Takumi, it was better than Sushi Sky next door, but still, your average cheap and cheerful sushi place... not authentic, but for the price, what do you expect?  Lately, I have found the quality has gone downhill... so I have given up on cheap sushi, and go to Solo Sushi Bekkan (which is just around the corner on Grosvenor) or Japango (Dundas and Elizabeth)"}
{"text":"Pretty average sushi place.  The one thing that is really good about this place is their \"special menu\" (see my attached photos). They have some REALLY good combo deals and can be ordered for dinner and not just lunch.   I had S7 (I think?) which was 8 pieces spicy salmon roll, 6 pieces california roll and a large avocado hand roll. Came with miso soup and salad. It was only $7.99 and the maki pieces were pretty big, definitely really cheap for a sushi \"dinner\" price. Plus you can get a 32 piece sushi/sashimi boat for $25. That's cheap.  The menu is absolutely huge, too huge, which can make ordering tricky. Janna S ordered a few things off the menu which ended up being quite a rip off. I would highly recommend sticking to the special menu.  The decor is nice, above average but nothing that will blow your socks off. Lots of small booths available. Service was good when we were there."}
{"text":"And their delivery has gone downhill. Recently they had a name change on Just-Eat and call themselves Kokyo (Takumi) Sushi House, but have the same address and phone number as Takumi Sushi Restaurant. They also offer the same variety of dishes. They've increased their delivery charge from free for $20+ to $3 for $25+.  I was so excited to order delivery from here tonight and it was absolutely disappointing. The sushi was vinegary, the rice was chewy, the tempura was stale, the sauces watered down, the katsu tasted like nothing. The only decent things were the gyoza and the salmon in the rolls.  I ate very little of my order before my stomach felt uneasy. I called the restaurant to ask for a refund and the lady who answered the phone told me they don't do refunds, then that she'd ask her manager, instead of putting me on hold I got to hear the rapid fire exchange between them. I was told they offer a refund if I bring the food in...uh...no that defeats the whole point of not going out in the freezing cold alone. Then she said they don't offer a refund. What? Whatever. I hung up and called Just-Eat. Fantastic customer service as usual.  So for spending $30 and eating about $5 worth of it I get $10 back in Just-Eat vouchers. Yeah...never ordering from here again and neither should you.  They've also significantly cheapened the quality of their packaging. Whereas before everything was proper and retained heat...my food came lukewarm at best and in lame styrofoam containers (if you saw their old packaging you'd be upset too!).  FUNNY STORY: The Just-Eat rep called me back to tell me about the vouchers and I thought they were only for Takumi and I was like \"uh no I don't want that\" and started panicking and he had to reassure me I could use them at any restaurant. That's how much the food sucks."}
{"text":"The walk-in dinner specials are extremely cheap. The portions are decent but you'll notice the amount of fish in the hand roll specials is miniscule. The taste is okay. Salads and soup are mediocre. This place would get 2 stars if it weren't for the super cheap dinner pricing."}
{"text":"With so many great sushi options in Toronto it's hard to name a standout, but Takumi is rock solid. Came here with friends after work on a Friday afternoon. The decor is elegant with the chef's station near the front, and spacious seating in the back. There is a specials menu with reduced rates from 3-5pm but I ordered off the regular one. My sashimi came in large fresh slabs and was served on a bamboo raft! I can't wait to go back and try their other selections.  Obligatory Title Pun: TAKUMI back to this restaurant!  Menu Readability: Storybook of a menu features lots of options. Well organized into groups.  Need to mention: I usually hate the salad that is served with the miso soup, but this place does it well. Not sure what their secret is.  What this place teaches me about myself: If served food on a bamboo raft, I will probably like it."}
{"text":"After another long day at work, my sister and I decided to head over to Takumi for dinner.  We were both exhausted and cooking dinner was the last thing we wanted to do.  Takumi is conveniently located along Yonge Street just a little north of College. It has a small storefront, so it may be easy to miss if you were just casually walking down Yonge street.  Takumi has a hard task of winning over the average customer as there's simply just too many Japanese options around this area.   We knew what we wanted for dinner so deciding was rather quick. We both wanted a bento box that would give us a mix of everything. My sister ordered the Sirloin Teriyaki bento box and I order the chicken katsu bento box. Both our bentos came with spring rolls, shrimp and veg tempura, salad, miso soup and some salmon and california rolls.  Ordering was quick and the food started rolling in within 5 mins or so.  The first was the salmon and california rolls with miso soup. 5 mins later came the bento box.  The rolls weren't bad, nothing special. I felt the miso soup was a little bit better than the average which is usually just way too salty. The bento box came and at first, didn't look too bad. The tempura was freshly fried and had a good batter to shrimp ratio.  The vegs didn't appear to have the same delicate touch as some were done well and some were pretty bad. The spring roll was a veggy spring roll and was very lightly packed.  Salad didn't have enough dressing and was rather watery.  Now onto the main, the chicken katsu was done alright.  The chicken was in thin slices and was fresh. My own personal preference would have been to have them cut thicker, but my sister like it. I tried her steak and it wasn't good at all. The steak was tough and was just a bad grade of steak.  I would recommend avoid this option for the bento boxes.  Overall, I would have to say Takumi is slightly below average.  I mean, out of all the Japanese options in the area, I wouldn't find myself coming back.  The food and decor isn't bad.  It's kinda cute, but the food just wasn't up to par with what's being offered.  And with the beauty of choice in this area of Yonge Street, you can skip places like this.  I would have to say pass."}
{"text":"I've now been getting their $4.99 take out specials almost twice a week! U get 16 pieces by choosing any two roll options.   I love the taste of the sushi and the price and quantity are a bonus!! Service is fast too. And each order comes with a bottle of water so one can even go to a park nearby and enjoy the sushi!"}
