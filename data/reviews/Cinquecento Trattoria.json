{"text":"Nice atmosphere & the food is \"meh\". But on our bill we were charged an extra 5% fed tax on top of the 13% HST and we had no alcohol during our meal. I asked the waiter about it, and he said no one has ever brought it up since the restaurant opened 7 months ago. Can never get a hold of the owner either. So this business has been making an extra 5% off it's patrons since the introduction of the HST. Sneaky."}
{"text":"DINERS BEWARE.--CHECK YOUR BILL-- It seems like they're overcharging 5% more everytime under Fed. Tax. There was a Food tax that was 13% already and then there's a Fed. Tax for 5%.  When we confronted the server about this he couldn't give us an answer but he won't deduct it from our bill! He left us with a card to the owner and went off to finish his pasta.  While the food was good (I'll give them that), I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"No longer in business. Bummer.  Used to really like the tavola calda, any 3 items from their 8 or so regular hot dishes at lunch time.  Called to make a reservation for dinner yesterday - only to get the voicemail system telling me they've closed their doors. Sad.  R.I.P., Cinquecento Trattoria - you will be missed."}
{"text":"Where do i begin????? such a comfortable place to be. Such happy and accommadating servers, he ran across the street to get a peach juice for my very picky son even tho its not on the menu. the server got a pretty sweet tip for that one. its so nice when your server takes that extra step to improve your experience. great food and a speedy service. I will go time and time again."}
{"text":"The main feature at lunchtime is the tavola calda - hot table - with a choice of 3 items (out of about seven) for ten bucks. Pretty good deal, but best to come early. We did, and I quite enjoyed the ricotta-filled pasta shells and cannelini beans. The veal marsala was a bit tough, but then, at this price point, that's not a huge surprise. Portions are not huge, which is probably a good thing because if I'd had any more heavy food, I would have napped through the afternoon.  Espresso at the end was excellent. Service was very friendly.  A couple of updates on previous reviews. The (outrageous) sale-tax problem appears to have been fixed. And there is table service, though you do have to line up to make your hot table choices."}
{"text":"I was disappointed by this restaurant. I came here for lunch on a weekday. It was somewhat busy but I think I missed the main lunch crowd by arriving at 1:30. There wasn't much left in terms of sandwiches so I got the '3 for $9.99' from the hot buffet. I got pasta shells stuffed with ground beef in a vodka sauce, steamed vegetables and the beet salad. I found that the portions were small and I still felt hungry after the meal (I'm not usually a big eater - typically I'll have leftovers or I'll just barely finish a small plate). The pasta was delicious but the vegetables and the salad seemed to be lacking in taste - they were a bit bland. Good quality but nothing exciting. I hoped that at least a piece of bread would accompany the meal so that I could try out the olive oil and vinegar which was set on every table, but no such luck.  Maybe the best thing to do is cough up the money and go there for dinner.  Location was good and I liked the big windows, but they were playing some commercial radio station which somewhat cheapened the surroundings."}
{"text":"Sure, I can't pronounce the name of the place but that doesn't matter when the food is so amazing! My co-workers and I tried this place out on a Wednesday for lunch. We got there just in time (right before 1pm) as it filled up quickly.  We were greeted by a friendly lady who explained that lunch doesn't have table service so she ran through the menu with us at lightning speed. My ears zoned in on the calzone with artichokes, roasted peppers and cheese. The rest was all Peanuts parents' style \"mmrrrr wahhh wahh\" I added a side dish of mushroom risotto for that extra carb indulgence. The calzone was packed with large chunks artichoke hearts and gooey cheese. The risotto had an amazing creamy, rich and garlicky flavour. it got my italian friend's approval (whom I'm trying to convince to start writing reviews on here since he's a foodie). My co-workers ordered the meat calzone and a pizza which looked fresh and delicious. My only complaint is it's very awkward to maneuver around to pay up the bill. It gets too crowded with people placing their food orders, the tables & chairs right there and people trying to leave.  I'm definitely going to come back here again. Now, I just have to master saying the name of the place so I can recommend it to my friends!"}
{"text":"Walking around after work looking for a patio to sit and relax - is a challenge on a sunny day. Some reason, the nice patio in this place was rather empty - maybe because it looked more fine dining and not so much a pub? either way, my friend and I lucked out.  Where to start? The service staff was super accommodating and friendly. I muttered that I could totally use some cold water and a waiter appeared magically with ice cold water - which remained full during the course of our stay.  Delicious break stick - totally compensates for not so wonderful bread. we had some beer and antipasto platter....OH it was so good. The tomato sauce for the mussels & calamari was SO GOOD i would have licked it clean had the wonderful waiter not brought me bread. He didn't bring enough bread though - and I was left watching him take away the delicious sauce(my mouth is watering thinking about it).  I usually track to Jane st for some amazing mussels but I no longer have the need to....what a wonderful discovery!!! I really can't wait to go back and try EVERYTHING!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and device. Lovely dinner with my wife before a jazz event in the area. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"We recently took a wander around Liberty Village.  We discovered a wonderful Italian restaurant called Cinquecento Trattoria.  What great food!  It is a small place on the main floor.  It does have an upper floor and apparently quite a nice rooftop space in the summertime.  The servers are friendly and efficient. My husband had the smoked salmon pasta with spring pea in a light cream sauce and I had the sausage and pepper pasta in a light sauce.   Both were amazing.  Plentiful and wonderfully tasting. Best of all -- the pasta came hot and stayed hot for the entire meal.  This is hard to accomplish in some restaurants -- by the time you get to the bottom it is pretty cooled off or cool... and so this made the meal enjoyable.  They serve white rustic bread with the meal and there is balsamic and olive oil on the table to enjoy with it.  Best of all -- quite reasonable as well!  So if you are looking for a nice Italian meal in Liberty Village - I recommend this spot.  They have pizza, sandwiches and main courses as well.  We saw a pizza come out of the kitchen and it looked amazing.  Maybe next time!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to sit, have some appetizers and some drinks - after having an afternoon of bad service. This place was interesting and we decided to give it a try.   Pleasant surprise. They are new to Liberty Village (opened just two months ago) and have a rooftop patio with an astonishing view, where you can have pizza, wine, drinks and antipasti. We had some great cheese and antipasti, white wine watching the sunset, and were served by a very friendly waiter - being new at the restaurant, he didn't hesitate to find out about what he didn't knew yet,  was very helpful and payed attention to every detail. Really liked the service there!   I strongly recommend this place and I'd like to go back there for a proper Italian dinner."}
{"text":"A coworker who likes this restaurant brought a few of us here for lunch one day.  I found their selection of food terrible ... almost everything had seafood in it, and since I do not eat seafood I was left with barely any options ... basically a chicken dish or a bread dish.  I had the chicken, which was basically plain chicken with breadcrumbs on it.  It was just completely flavorless.  It also seemed to be very expensive for what I got, which was not even really a meal, just a single piece of meat. It was very crowded there with barely any tables and barely any space to move around.  I would never return here and would absolutely not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  Having said that, my coworker seems to like it, although I can't imagine why."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Cinquecento Trattoria for supper tonight after spending the afternoon at the Indy. We've been wanting to go there for a while.  They just celebrated their first anniversary in Liberty Village.  We sat on the upper patio and had a great view of Liberty Village and downtown.  We both order the Cacciatore pizza ... sausage, mozzarella, red onions, gorgonzola and red peppers.  I had mine without the red onions and gorgonzola.  The pizzas were big and delicious ... we both took half home.  Valentina was our server and she took good care of us.  We're glad we finally checked it out and we'll be back."}
