{"text":"I have been to this venue for several concerts, and the venue is great for that. The multi-tiered setup lends itself well to concerts.   Lots of space, probably holds in the range of a thousand people. Nice intimate setting for music. The acoustics are good, and very intimate setting.  Love going to this venue for shows."}
{"text":"This is probably the coolest bar in town. It's in an old theatre, right down town on Stephen Ave, and has a touch of elegance to it. The hockey game is on the biggest screen I've ever seen at a bar and there are tvs everywhere with any game you want on. You don't even have to miss a minute, with tvs above the urinals in the mens' room. You can tell it used to be a theatre; they've kept the balconies and furnished them with sofas and tables. It's not cheap but it is a cool place to check out sometime. They also offer Flames ticket packages with dinner included. I've heard it gets busy on weekends and that some players go there after the game...."}
{"text":"Great downtown sports bar. Coming for the USA it's great to see an entire bar dedicated to hockey. Good atmosphere. Better then average sports bar food."}
{"text":"The food and service is mediocre at best.  For big events they have a crappy limited menu.  They won't answer their phone and don't return phone calls.  The only reason I still go is with the enormous screen it is awesome for big events.  Also the layout is cool.  Without the enormous screen and cool layout in a historic building I would not be back.  Unless you want to see a big event on a giant screen I wouldn't bother with this place.  The attitude is basically we provide such a great atmosphere to watch big games we don't need to give good service or serve good food."}
{"text":"After grudgingly leaving Joey Tomatoes down the street I came here to watch my Anaheim Ducks take on the Calgary Flames. This place is a converted theater turned sports bar thats awesome.  Sat down and no sooner had we started in on our beers did the friendly bachelor party right next to us insist that we sit with them and have fun.  They really howled when they found out that I was from Orange County and promptly informed me that the Ducks would probably kick the Flames arse-holes.  This place has a screen the size of a movie theater to show the action and the waitresses were great.  A very cool feature was that before the game started they passed out hockey pucks with a Flames players number on it. If your particular player either scored a goal, got in a fight  or got a penalty, you got a free beer.  Very fun place with a great crowd, Our new Canadian buddies were awesome and I'll be back soon.  Only downfall is that they currently serve ONLY Molson Canadian on tap while the Olympic games are going. Muddled through anyway and had an excellent time.  Flames won 3-1 and my new chums had a good laugh at my expense."}
{"text":"Ah Flames Central.  A forewarning: My review of Flames Central might a bit biased, but here we are anyway.  I have never been to Flames Central to watch a game. Its not everyday that you'll find me at a sports bar watching hockey/football/whatever. Unless its the Habs playing and I'm decked out in my Habs shirt, cheering on Price and Kostitsyn. But that doesnt last very long either..  However, I have been to Flames Central for other events. And I LOVE the venue. The first time I went was for a Timeraiser function, and was impressed right off the bat. The space is HUGE, swanky, and super slick. The staff are great, the decor is sexy, and the drinks come fast. The next time I went to Flames Central was for a Halloween party, and there were live DJs, MCs, the works. Thats when I fell in LOVE with Flames Central. The sound system was off the charts, and the layout was PERFECT for live music and dancing. The crowd was perfect, the lighting was perfect, the music was perfect, and the Djs and MCs blew my mind. The party was probably one of the best I had been to in my life, and I know that if it was any other venue, the vibe would not have been so fantastic. Flames Central houses some of the best acts/concerts in town, and I am so glad this place exists.   Also, since it is so close to the C-train, it is extremely convenient to get back home after a night of partying or after celebrating a Flames win."}
{"text":"I love Flames Central, probably one of my favorite venues to see my favorite DJ's and artists/musicians perform. I love the fact that there are two levels to this place so you can see the action from different levels of awesomeness. This establishment boasts a main bar right when you walk in, a bar on each side the dance floor as well as another man bar on the upper level. There are plenty of booths to hang out at if dancing isn't your thing which is awesome. I love how cool the interior is with the big Calgary flames C on the ceiling. The board screens that go around the dance floor area is a nice touch as well."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time for the annual Pure Pride party, and what a great place! A sports bar rife with Flames memorabilia might not seem like someone's first choice for a Drag celebration, but it was perfect. Perfect for dancing, the sound system is new so the music sounds amazing, and staff is super-friendly.   The menu doesn't look particularly vegan-friendly, or gluten-intolerance-friendly, so I'd probably only come here for drinks and dancing. But stop by and check-in! They have a discount offer when you do."}
{"text":"In regard to NHL Hockey (Go Sharks!), the most recent lockout, and my occasional visits to Flames Central over the years:  It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to heaven, we were all going direct the other way....."}
{"text":"Although branded as a Flames themed sports bar, Flames Central is a great destination for a wide array of audiences, not just flames fans. Specifically, Flames Central is a great venue for live music entertainment catered to medium sized crowds that would be too small for any of the venues on the Stampede Grounds. For this review I will be focusing on the entertainment venue perspective rather than the Sports Bar/Restaurant POV.  Despite having multiple giant Flames \"Cs\" carved into the ceiling the acoustics are actually awesome in this venue, much better than other facilities of this size. Plus it's very spacious; it offers a good sized dance floor with standing space around it, as well as seating higher up. There is also a second level with several places to stand and semi-private booths to sit. Even the center balcony area has a multiple tiered Mezzanine as not to impede other people's views. The bars at Flames Central are quite nice, two of which are 30 feet long. This means it's easy to find a place to post-up for a drink order and you don't have to push your way in or fight the crowd. There are also a couple smaller bars as well that still feel quite lengthy and are easier to order from. For premium viewing with maximum privacy there is even a third floor executive suite with its own private bar. There are multiple washrooms, so you usually don't have to wait too long, even during sold-out events!   Prices for drinks are quite high during shows, I recommend having a few drinks at one of the many surrounding restaurants before hand. Behind located right on Stephen Avenue is advantageous because you're very close to the C-Train and there are a lot of Taxis near by. Also when you enter for major events they have metal detectors and added security, might be annoying for some but I personally appreciate the added security for just a quick minor inconvenience. Better to be safe than sorry :)!  One thing that really makes Flames Central cool is it's also know as a \"Virtual Arena\", as there is an entertainment system integrated throughout the facilities that is controlled through a control station/Power Ring on the second floor know as \"the ring of fire\". Take a look around at all the TVs, ceiling lights, wall lighting, bar lighting, floor lighting, 30 foot projection screen and everything else to really get an appreciation of the technology set-up in Flames Central!  P.S. FOR YELPERS: I know I'm not reviewing the restaurant, but there's a 20% off lunch Monday-Friday Check-in Offer.  If there was a performer I wanted to see and they were playing at Flames Central I would not hesitate to get tickets. The venue is solid all around and really caters to all types of viewers, from people wanting to get close, up-front and dance, to people who rather stay back, relax and enjoy from a more private seat. Only knock against Flames Central it is it can be a tad expensive."}
{"text":"All in all, Flames Central is a great venue to catch a game. The decor is cool and they have tons of seating of various types throughout, including \"suites\" on the upper levels. However, if you're having a group on a game night, a reservation is highly recommended.  The food is fairly good - although, the menu is a little small. Typical \"bar\" fare, for the most part. The service is always awesome. The servers are very attentive and staff are wandering around helping to take empty glasses and finished plates all the time."}
{"text":"Being an avid Oilers fan, visiting Flames Central for the first time wasn't high on my \"must visit\" list.  But, living in Calgary, buying my first home here, and discovering years ago that Calgary is where I want to raise a family, the visit was inevitable.  Let me tell you, I am glad I went.  Looking past the Calgary Flames overload, Flames Central is an awesome sportsbar in it's own right.  The massive 30 foot HD projection screen makes my 100 inch HD projection screen look sad.  And watching a game on the equivalent of a movie screen is nothing short of awesome.  On our first visit and the few visits since, the food was always really good.  Flames Central isn't your typical sportsbar there, as the food they offer is equivalent to earls or Moxies.  The service we received was always pretty good, even during very busy nights.  It's not perfect, but most places fall apart when busy, so it's not a surprise.  If you're looking for somewhere to watch the game, definitely try out Flames Central.  If it's a PPV night though, go early!"}
{"text":"Flames Central is located in an old converted theatre and it shows. You walk through the main entrance and into the main area and it is majestic. High ceilings and balconies, a wide open space, a huge screen on the dance floor... A visit here is definitely an experience. It has a very classy and contemporary interior which is a bit at odds with the brightly lit, giant fluorescent sign outside.  On game nights, there are lineups out the door. But what I really go for are the shows. There's a lot of seating - it's a big place, and it's nice to have a place to sit down. But the ceilings open over the dance floor, and it gives it the feeling of a wide open space. The stage is big, and it is easy to see from any point in the big theatre. It is conveniently located about a block away from the C-train, so you don't even need to worry about parking.   It is a nice space to occupy. It can fit a lot of people, with the downside being that it takes a lot of people to fill it up (which is not always the case). It is also a bit on the pricey side. But overall, a visit here, whether for a DJ, a show or a game is well worth it."}
{"text":"Can I rate a zero? Worst service EVER yesterday. Our waitress came by TWICE someone else had to bring us our food which took almost an hour. We waited over 20 minutes for water which never actually came and our bill. Only to find out our waitress left. I will not willingly be going back. The food was awful, there was only an opportunity to get one drink. And no apology was ever offered. TERRIBLE."}
{"text":"Place is empty, service was poor but generally a good place to have some beers.  On a hockey game this place is packed, but come here on a summer Friday after work and you will find the atmosphere stale.  I rather kick at a place with a little life like the palomino."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Went to watch Battle of Alberta last night. Lazy boring vibe and while they said they were busy and full (though only 2/3 of the restaurant was opened), it took over 20 mins for someone to even come by to ask us for our order...AFTER we had flagged down two other people who just said they weren't our waiter \"sorry\". When we had enough and just walked out, no one even noticed! Wow. How irresponsible and what a lack of training. A true disappointment."}
{"text":"They have THE BIGGEST screen in town which makes them the prime location for watching sports events. The food is nothing special, just another sport-bar food. Their website is not always accurate, so call before you go!  Tip: check in on YELP and get 20% off !!!!"}
{"text":"I've only come here for concerts, and have been impressed. The acoustics are great, there's a spacious dance floor, and the architectural layout gives the place a feeling of spaciousness and elegance. I have a hard time imagining it as a sports bar, but love it as an event venue."}
{"text":"I encountered flames central for the very first, and only time thus far, in august when I moved to calgary. I went to see the Dirty Heads (one of my fav bands) concert. They were opened up by a band of which i forget the name and another band named \"Last chance heroes\". LCH and DH were absolutely fantastic. I really appreciated the open space of the venue. It is quite large. The ambiance and the crowed were great, it was a heck of a good night.  The bartenders were fairly good. At first i was being served by a younger female bartender who was clearly short pouring our drinks, which being a bartender myself i did not appreciate. I then mentioned this to one of her male colleagues and we got to talking. He was an experienced bartender and also gave me a few deals to compensate for the short pouring of the lady bartender.   over all , the place looked great, the sound was fantastic and the service was great (except for the short pouring part of this one bartender).  I recommend this venue to watch a good show in a medium sized venue... Not liking arena shows myself, this is the perfect venue for a guy like myself to enjoy a live band. let loose and knock back a few drinks!    I understand that it is also available to rent out for large parties!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Flames Central on a few different occasions throughout my years in Calgary. Hockey games, concerts, pre-drinks for other events... and I must say, I'm pleased.   The layout is wonderful, with the stage at the front, some seating on the sides and the balcony above. Smart thinking turning an old theatre. I've only had appys and drinks here, but the food is good, the drinks are cold and the service is fast, efficient and professional. The placement of the bars is also quite useful. Two on either side of the main floor, one at the back... and having the coat check downstairs and out of the way? Works for me!  Sound-wise, it's far better to see a concert here than at the Saddledome, yet another advantage to the fact that it was a theatre once upon a time. It's a great event space. I'm looking forward to more fun things to attend at Flames Central!"}
{"text":"It's a great venue for catching a game. Great atmosphere. And how can any other place compete with the gigantic screen?  However, the food kind of sucks. My burger pattie was as dry as a hockey puck. And the wings appy had 6 tiny wings and 1 carrot and 1 celery stick with a price tag of $11.70 (did they drop some on the way to the table?). I would recommend to go have an early dinner somewhere else, and then come and watch the game."}
{"text":"I didn't come here to dance. I didn't come here to drink and bump and grind up on fly honies. That's not me.  I came here for one reason and one reason only: a marketing networking event with free food. \"Free\" tends to get me out to these things, and the shoulder rubbing can't hurt.  Anyways, I was wicked impressed. This is a classy looking joint. It's well laid out and there's lots of room to sit, stand and - if you're so inclined - dance.   The food was limited to sliders and appetizers, but what I did have was excellent. The sliders were flavorful and not overly greasy. I had a burger slider and a salmon burger - both were great. Stuffed mushrooms were excellent too (if not a little garlicy), and the shephard's pie bites were delicious.  The sound was good for the band, but I was too busy being awesome to really pay much attention. Sorry, blues-brothers-cover-band.   All in all, if you're going to host an event somewhere in this city, this is certainly not a bad place to do it."}
{"text":"This is a great venue for special events such as live music and hockey games, but otherwise I think it's too big and gawdy to be an everyday pub.    I'm not a fan of the narrow stairwell to the basement restrooms and coat check, as you can barely pass by a skinny person.  Also, I was here last night for an event and the toilets were a disaster early in the evening.  I don't know if they have plumbing issues or if a half dozen women were too rude to flush, but I think someone needs to attend the restroom nearly full-time on a busy night."}
{"text":"Had an office function there.  The food was not too bad.  I must say it has improved a lot since I last ate in the restaurant when it first opened.    When you first get to the restaurant, get accustomed to the darkness and the redness.  It took me a few minutes to get used to the dim light in there.  The only bright lights are the TV screens and huge jumbotrons.    Love my virgin Caesar!  Spicy and tasty."}
