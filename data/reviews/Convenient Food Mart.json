{"text":"Lil Chets is within Convenient Food Mart - but I enjoy both equally.   Let's talk about the Chicken! Walk in, go to the back, and order some quick chicken. White, dark, legs, you name it they got it! Plus I love the breaded potato wedges (ho-jos, jo jos) or whatever you call them.   Try the broccoli salad too! So good.   We get Lil Chet's chicken in Convenient about once a week, for $13 it feeds a family of 5. Try it for a quick dinner!"}
