{"text":"Overpriced street food. What you end up paying for a gourmet hot dog is what you'd pay for good French, Indian or Italian food with decent service. The food is good but not great. The biggest problems: You serve yourself in this restaurant. This means getting up and looking for the right counter to place your order. Most irritating, the machine-like bus-girl tried to swipe our food/drinks from the table even though we hadn't finished (the glasses were half full!); nothing worse than an overzealous bus-person. Positives: The bread was good, freshly baked in fact, and the duck fries were also tasty.   In an trendy place like this you expect to be served and tip for it. At Vwerst, you end up feeling like you need to tip but without the service. If you're jonesing for an upscale hotdog then this is for you but in the end all you're getting is meat, bread, and potatoes. Tasty but not a lot of selection. A bit pretentious and poorly thought out."}
{"text":"Stopped by Wvrst for a casual Saturday dinner and drinks. The wait was minimal wih no reservations. (Side note: the host was super friendly, kept everyone waiting in line in the loop of how long it would take to get a seat and helped us find a spot in the communal tables).  Food: We got the wild boar sausage on a bun with sauerkraut and sweet peppers, and the rabbit sausage on a bun with sauerkraut and jalapeños. We also got the duck fat fries (comes with 2 dipping sauces -- we got the wvrst sauce and the jalapeno/cilantro sauce). Wvrst sauce was better but the food overall was delicious!  Definitely try a gamey meat -- you won't regret it. Food was tasty, filling and fast.   Drink: We got the flight (6 beers, 5 oz, $12, preselected for you) and the Folly Saison. Beer flight is worth it if you want to get a taste of a few. Unlimited water at the self serve station.  Would go back for a casual night with friends!"}
{"text":"Delicious sausages, but I wish they had some gluten-free substitutions for the bread."}
{"text":"Affordable, fun, authentic and good variety. Great to share with friends. Speedy service. Very knowledgeable staff with recommendations for beer pairings. I'm more on the adventurous side so rabbit etc is a huge bonus. Only down side is that due to its popularity, it can get very busy with line ups down the stairs and out the door. Plan wisely."}
{"text":"Absolutely Amazing!  The sausages were spectacular, the fries with the peppercorn dipping sauce so delicious, & everything was so fresh.  The beer selection was also perfect!  I love German food & beer, and this was the BEST!!!"}
{"text":"Wvrst is very cool! The interior and the counter systems are fresh and interesting. They have an impressive beer selection and the sausages are really delicious! Good taste combinations and the sauces are wonderful.   When I first went to Wvrst it wasn't that full. But I've understood that the place is very popular and I can imagine it can get very loud there.  Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I seriously have such a fun time saying the name of this place. Easily pleased, I am. So it's lucky for me that Wvrst easily pleases. I enjoyed an italian sausage here, some sugar cane soda and duck fat fries. It was a surprising amount of fries. They were delicious, and the chipolte dipping sauce was nice a spicy. I was not wow-ed by the sausage, but I plan to go back and try a different sausage for different results! This is a refreshing take on a restaurant, and a good place to get your sausage or beer on."}
{"text":"I visited WVRST with my husband for a late Sunday dinner date. It was our first time visiting, so we weren't too sure what to expect, except they had duck fat fries and German sausages. :D When we arrived, because it was Sunday, the beer hall was relatively empty. We could instantly imagine how packed it would be on Friday/Saturday nights.  With the biggest selection of beer I have ever seen (600+ kinds!), it was one of the hardest decisions I had to make so far. Hubby and I couldn't choose, so we decided to try their pre-selected flight of 6 beers. Each was 5 oz, and it was great to be able to try a huge variety at an affordable price.  We ordered two sausages and their popular duck fat fries. We opted for the small size of the fries with one dipping sauce, and decided to try their signature WVRST dipping sauce. I was disappointed with the dipping sauce because although it tasted great and went well with the fries, I felt that it wasn't that different from your regular Chipotle sauce that you can easily get in any other restaurant. The duck fat fries were pretty crisp and tasted great without any dipping sauce at all on its own, but I'm not sure if it really tastes that much different from your regular fries because I couldn't really taste the difference enough. I would opt for their 'dirty fries' with jalapeños next time.  I ordered their traditional Bratwvrst sausage in Currywvrst, which was a tomato curry sauce and country bread on the side. Did I like it? I'm not sure. The sausage was very juicy, tasty, and truly great. The sauce was also tasty as well, but because the country bread is rather really thin and small, I would opt for their regular toasted bun next time for the same price. My slice of country bread was quite burnt on one side, and for the price I paid, I really expected a bit more in terms of the portion. Neither of us were full after our meal and went for seconds somewhere else.  Hubby ordered their duck sausage made of foie gras and chose the sautéed jalapeños topping. The peppers did well at balancing out the flavour of the foie gras, which could be overwhelming for some. For the price, it was a great sausage, as foie gras is a pretty expensive food! The regular bun here is much bigger in size, more soft, and not burnt! :D Hubby really enjoyed his sausage and said it was one of the best things he had ever tasted.  If you're looking for a new place to go with your friends, this is a must try! People working there were all knowledgeable, nice, and prompt. Our food was brought to us pretty quickly (because it wasn't that busy?), and with its easy going atmosphere, it's bound to be a hit with everyone. Would we come back? Yes, even though it is a little overpriced for its portions. We would come back for their selection of beer!"}
{"text":"I was here on Saturday for a birthday party, it was my second time here (the first being a few years ago) and thoroughly enjoyed the experience!   We were a group of approx 12 people so we had 2 tables reserved - if you have a group I highly recommend making a reservation and getting there early! Our reservation was for 7pm and I realized later on why it was so necessary - this place gets PACKED on the weekend.   As for the food we ordered 3 different times and each time got around 6 sausages, curry wvrst style (sauce on the side), I think this is the way to go in a group because I got to try almost every sausage on the menu! I think in a smaller group it's nice to get a full sausage on the bun because I like the toppings (sauerkraut and jalapenos please!) but with a group this worked out really well. My favourites were (in order): TAMWORTH , BERKSHIRE, KRANJSKA (tastes like a super high quality hot dog!), BOEREWORS, CHORIZO. We tried others but those were tops, I did try Bison and Kangaroo but wasn't thrilled on either - the kangaroo was especially dry, it's too lean of a meat.   We also had orders of plain duck fat fries, and the dirty duck fat fries. I loved the dirty fries, curry sauce and jalapenos were so good and the fries managed to stay crispy!   The beer selection is intimidating but the bartender was very helpful and even gave me a couple of samples. I settled on the Pilsner Urquell for the night and really enjoyed it, nice easy compliment to all of that meat.   My only complaints are: very crowded - I couldn't believe there was a line out the door from about 8pm-11pm, and the crowd resulted in a very loud and VERY hot room. I understand it's winter but I didn't need to sweat on top of my meat sweats.   Anyways a great spot for a birthday gathering and I'd happily go back!"}
{"text":"Really tasty sausages. I recommend curry type to share. I tried venison, wild boar, bison and turkey. I recommend venison and bison. We also had a flight of six ciders to share between two people. We were five in the group and the other three ordered a flight of beers on tap. We all five shared the duck fat fries too that were amazing! Nice atmosphere and staff. Only negative: $20 per person (tax included) for a lunch."}
{"text":"Great experience. Loved the different types of sausage, and how you want it. Beer to top it off. Great vacation spot"}
{"text":"Friday was date night for my girlfriend and I, and it was my turn to choose the establishment for the evening. What could be better than sausages and (gluten-free) beer? I thought. Turns out I made a pretty shrewd choice when I suggested that we eat at WVRST.  Located on King Street West near Portland St., WVRST features a spacious communal cafeteria-style dining hall and counter service. We arrived around 6pm with plenty of open space to choose from. Other reviewers have described the interior as \"unpretentious\", which is accurate and refreshing, given the trendy King West location of the restaurant.  WVRST offers an impressive beer list to compliment their wide variety of sausages. They even include helpful pairing suggestions for each of their draught beers (on the menu posted on Yelp, but not on their website).   We had a good idea on what we were going to eat before we arrived, having perused the menu online previously. However, they do offer a variety of sausages in a tantalizing display case so narrowing our choice down to four was tough.  SERVICE - Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by the hostess who asked if it was our first time visiting WVRST. When we told her that it was, she explained how the counter service worked and gave us two menus so we could make our choice. Overall, the service was swift and the people we spoke to were very pleasant.   FOOD - After asking how filling the sausages are, our server replied that two sausages are ideal per person, so we decided to share an order of four sausages with a side of duck fat fries. We opted to try the sausages currywurst style, cut up into bite-sized morsels with a side of dipping sauce, but sausage buns are also available.   We were adventurous in our selections, opting for choices all from the \"Game\" menu:  1. Guinea Fowl filled with cheddar and asparagus 2. Pheasant filled with apple and sun-dried tomato 3. Bison filled with blueberry and maple 4. Kangaroo (!) filled with 'fine herbs'  Each one was delicious and featured a unique taste. However, we both thought the Kangaroo was the tastiest of them all. The Guinea Fowl had the sharpest, 'gamiest' flavour of all of them.   Word of advice - try eating the sausages without the curry for the first bite, to get a better idea of the flavour. We thought the curry sauce tended to overpower the sausage flavour a bit (they actually don't recommend ordering currywurst style with game sausages, likely for this very reason).  My only disappointment would be with the duck fat fries, which didn't taste that different from regular fries and weren't really worth the $6.50 I paid. That said, they allow you to choose 2 different dipping sauces for a large order of fries, from a list of 14 in-house sauces. We got the chive & garlic mayo-based dip (great!) and the jalapeno & cilantro yogurt-based dip (okay), for a grand total of 6 dips if you include the 4 curries that come with the sausages!   I also ordered a Bard's Tale Dragon's Gold gluten-free beer, which is one of the best GF beers I've tried. Kudos to WVRST for including it on the menu (along with New Grist).  We were both pleasantly full after the meal. Next time I'll skip the fries, though.  PRICE - The traditional, poultry, and vegetarian sausages will run you $7 each. We opted to try four of the game sausages, which cost $9 each, or $36 for 4. Total price for two people, including two drinks, was around $60. Not cheap, but not totally outrageous.   So what's the bottom line?  Savoury. Delicious. Lively. Fun. Pricey. Worthwhile.  You should go eat here."}
{"text":"This place got sausages of all types and shapes!   Pork, chicken, beef, lamb, duck, rabbit, bison, even KANGAROO!! Paired with one of their excellent selection of beers, plus a side of their mouth-watering duck fat fries and you're in heaven! But there's more to this place. The decor is very pleasant, inviting, and friendly.   I don't want to say no more because this is one of those places you've got to experience for yourself. Bottom line, this is one sausage fest i'm always looking forward to! 4.5 Stars!  Food: A Service: A Food presentation: A Atmosphere: A+ Prices:B+ Recommended? YES!"}
{"text":"Asked a server for condiments, and she told me to approach a table myself and take them. I did so, and afterwards saw her deliver condiments to another table. Trendy? Rude? Sausages were good."}
{"text":"Had Tamworth, firm salty but good. KAAS insanely good cheese tubes in it.  Duck fat fries rock! Dirty was too overwhelming in size and flavours.  Best beer joint on King.  Love this place. Lugtread on tap and neat ciders.  Will return for 3rd visit soon."}
{"text":"Loved it!  It is like a German beer hall.  It is a sausage place that has many types of sausage-- including more than one vegan option.  Great food, good service, friendly staff."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here last night.  I've been eager to try it as its a bit of a new concept for Toronto and its gotten decent reviews.  I liked it a lot!  We both got the currywurst and I'd definitely recommend that.  We got two different kinds; the Boerewors (which is beef and coriander) and the Kranjska (which is pork and marjoram).  The Kranjska was definitely my favourite - had a really nice taste and the sauce they put on is excellent.  We also shared an order of the large duck fat fries.  We chose the Wvrst (spicy) dipping sauce - YUM!   The portions are pretty big and I found the quality of the food to be really good.  I also liked the decor.  As has been previously mentioned, it has a German beer hall decor (though a fairly sanitized version of one from my memory of going to one in Germany).  I liked the red glossy brick wall.  The benches are bit uncomfortable after awhile but it had a fun atmosphere  Some people have complained about the price of the beers but it is what it is.  For the two of us, we ate and drank for around $45 which I think is pretty good for a Friday night.  The service was really good too - I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come to with a group of friends. On weekends this place can get quite busy but I have never had an issue waiting for the food too long. I'm not a big beer drinker but they have a wide selection of beers for everyone. I always opt for the Italian sausage with the duck fat fries. My favourite sauces on the side are the buttermilk ranch and chives roasted garlic.   The service is amazing and the server was very knowledgeable in the variety of beers they serve. I highly recommend this place if you want to have a chill night out with friends."}
{"text":"Huge line to get into the restaurant, and huge line to order the food once your inside.  It probably took us 40minutes to get inside and another 40minutes to get the food  (It was a Saturday night though - maybe it gets better during the week). They don't do reservations for parties of less than 10.   The sausages themselves are good - they have great vegan options that are tasty. It is very big and filling. Their salad wasn't very good but I guess that's not what people come here for. All my friends got the duck fat fries with their sausages and they seemed like a hit.   Also they have a huge beer and cider menu, and do a fun little taster of six different ciders or beers to share (or not ;).   Was a little pricey but a fun experience. I can see why its popular."}
{"text":"I have mixed feeling about this place. On the one hand, the food I've had there has was delicious. On the other hand, the space is so loud and out of control that I don't think that I can handle ever going back.   Sausages and duck fat fries. All you need to know. DELICIOUS. There is a HUGE selection of sausages, which is nice. Food-wise things are great.    However, the concept and the space was just a huge letdown for me. First, you line up to order food. When we were there we waited what seemed like forever just to get to the front of the line to order and then for the food to arrive. Also, you order your drinks in one place and your food in another (two long line ups, which I really could have skipped).   The atmosphere in the bar (it was a Saturday night for a friend's birthday) was out of control. It is unbelievably loud - like being in a night club and extremely crammed (large communal tables and benches). You couldn't talk to anyone while seated since it was SO loud and I felt like I spent most of our time in line waiting, rather than socializing.   Maybe you're into the loud crazy frat house atmosphere but i'd skip it. Wvrst, if you had a food truck I'd love to eat that but your beer hall is out of control loud."}
{"text":"Had lunch here twice. Always good and friendly. Should come and try their duck fat fries and all kind of beers!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for sausages and beer! And don't forget the duck fat fries or any of the homemade sauerkraut or pickles. Causal place with not a lot of wait times. I had my kids there and we all felt at home."}
{"text":"Inspired by Munich style beer halls, Wvrst opened mid last year in the Toronto King West area, serving up some exotic sausages and a wide variety of beers. I've been wanting to try this place since it opened and luckily I was able to find someone who was yet to have tried it.  Thanks for coming with me Justine H! In a nutshell, this place is like Oktoberfest, and now you can have it everyday at Wvrst!  Wvrst  definitely has flavours of a European sausage and beer hall, and really reminded me of Oktoberfest (except nicer). It's spacious and dimly lit with with ceiling strung lights --a casually comfortable place.  Wvrst Menu Scattered around the hall tables were these long sheets of recycled paper which would be the menu. If you're looking for something other than fries, sausages, and alcohol, you're probably at the wrong place. The menu is simple, but the numerous options lie in the type of each you fancy.  At the back of the establishment there is a long open space that leads up to a rather small counter where you order and pay. I imagine this empty space is filled up by a line up during busier lunch hours. It wasn't too bad on the Tuesday night that we went.   Sausage Display Case The display case is neatly organized with all the different sausages that they have. If you're in the mood for some exotic meats, then you're in luck. They have everything from kangaroo to venison, rabbit to guinea fowl. Justine H and I weren't too appetized looking at it, but after we managed to get over its appearance we went up to the counter to order.   Drinks They have quite a number of beers here, bottled and on tap. Definitely not as many as a place like Beer Bistro might have, but more than just your commonly seen brews. Justine opted for the San Pellegrino Orange, and me an Austrailian beer Stiegl. Figured it was only fitting that I had a beer in the given setting!   Bratwvrst ($6) -Veal, Pork, and Wine Duck ($9) -Maple and Fois Gras  These contemporary European sausages for the most part were quite good. Juicy and full of flavour. Didn't feel like I was eating a super artificial chunk of meat like I do having hot dogs from street vendors. In terms of flavour, I think it really depends on the sausage you order. You could definitely taste the fois gras in the Duck sausage, which was something Justine H didn't enjoy too much. I didn't mind it and found it to be an interesting combination, but I definitely liked the Bratwvrst more. I'd like to add that these sausages are quite small, and even with my small appetite I was unsatisfied having just the one hot dog.   Duck Fat Fries ($4.50) Lots of other food enthusiasts raved about these fries, so we ordered a serving to share. Perhaps it was the heightened expectations from all the amazing reviews, but these duck fat fries fell just a bit short. They were full bodied, thick, and buttery, but they just weren't amazing. To be honest, I couldn't differentiate what difference the duck fat had on the fries compared to the ones made in regular oil. The order of fries comes with one dipping sauce, and the Wvrst Spicy we chose was great. Definitely not the best fries I've had, but they are quite tasty still, and would easily satisfy those random starchy fry cravings.   One last thing to note, is that they are big on leafs games here! They have a ticket giveaway at around 6:30pm the night of every Leaf's game at the Air Canada Center. With TV's all around the dining hall and tables that encourage conversation, it would be a great place to go catch the game along with a couple of drinks. But be warned, it might get pretty rowdy later in the night with cheering Leafs fans who've had a couple drinks or two!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and they have cask! No patio. Good sausage selection but lacks variety in toppings."}
{"text":"went on a friday around 7pm... be warned, this place gets busy!  They apparently don't do reservations (though several tables had reserved signs!  Perhaps you need to know someone?!?). trying to 'save' a table for friends running late will result in severe 'cut eye' from others trying to find a seat.   But space issues aside... Wvrst is one of the Best..  Food is very tasty, and not too badly priced.  I'd recommend the duck fries vs. regular fries (worth the extra buck or two for taste and crispness).   I had the pheasant sausage on my visit... it was quite nice though nothing particularly remarkable (what does one expect from pheasant though!).    I found the beer menu a bit over priced, but I give them credit for the variety of interesting brews.   This is more of a 1hr eating stop vs. a 3hr dining experience... so be warned.... it should be part of your evening vs. your plan for the evening.    My one wish (if Wvrst is reading)... would be for them to offer a group platter.  perhaps 4 different sliced up sausages, some frites in the middle, a few toppers on the side, and skip the buns.  ie.  Allowing people to taste a variety of sausage options vs. having just one specific 'hot dog'.     I also wish they offered a simple desert (apple Streudle perhaps, sticking with the German theme).    That said.... they know what they do... and what they do, they do well!"}
{"text":"I tried the wild boar wurst as recommended by other yelpers. I'm happy to agree that it was a delicious sausage! Savoury, juicy  and flavourful (like pork but better). The mushroom, tea and wild boar all tasted well together. I chose to eat mine on a bun, which was a nice white bread that reminded me of baguette-style rolls (crunchy crust, soft and chewy on the inside). I also ordered a pear Country Cider with my food- it was good! Lightly sweet, good pear flavour, and sufficiently carbonated. :-)  Overall, it was a spendy but delicious night. I enjoyed the communal table, beer hall atmosphere. The staff are friendly, professional, and pretty on their game with up cleaning tables after diners leave."}
{"text":"WRVST is such a cool place! It looks awesome. The lighting, the bar, the seating...just a chill place to hang out with your friends and eat some exotic sausage. All the different sausages have a different beer pairing and I would definitly roll with the experts suggestions (how would I know what to drink with elk meat) Oh and the duck fat fries *swoons* are incredible. Best fries in TO.  Overall, if you like meat, beer, fries, and a fun atmosphere I would recommend this place wholeheartedly."}
{"text":"A good place for a beer with the gang. The venison wurst was very good. I've had better duck fat fries, but they were in Baltimore and not so much better as to justify the airfare. a nice selection of local microbrews on tap. A warning is definitely the volume of the crowd, be prepared to shout it out."}
{"text":"This is a modern beer hall with shared wooden tables and benches stretching from end-to-end. Touches of brushed metal and a deep-red subway tile complete the look. And Wvrst looks great. Also, their food is pretty damn tasty too. AND a great tap selection (of course!) curated by one of the main Beer Bistro kids.  With a long list of sausages from an impressive number of animals, I chose the kangaroo, boar, and a regular sausage. While I can't say I'd ever be able to distinguish the various critters I consumed, I can say they were all pretty good. I guess my tastes are pretty pleb though, as my favourite was the Kranjska, loaded with hot peppers. Perfect with a cold, refreshing beer.  Prices are pretty decent for the area and I could see coming here for lunch. Toppings are fun too, but I'd suggest you get them pretty naked if you want to taste the meats. If you want to get creative with toppings, I'd go with a plain sausage and doll it up as you like. While the space is great for groups, don't expect too much group conversation happening. It get really noisy."}
{"text":"Definitely in my top 5 places to eat in Toronto. The food tastes amazing, the prices are pretty cheap, and it's an awesome hipster-German-picnic table type vibe. I went a handful of times last year, and I can't wait to go back many times through this year."}
{"text":"Cool place to try out! They have a huge selection of kraft beer. The food is good. I'm not really into the communal seating thing!"}
{"text":"What a genius idea (leave it to the Germans...): keep to a very limited menu (sausages - albeit 18 different ones, fries, dipping sauces), thereby ensuring consistent quality; restrict the bar to various imported and local beers (again, keeping it simple); and establish a cafeteria-style serving method (cutting out staffing overhead). Combine this with an open, funky interior conducive to cameraderie/socializing and this place is gonna be a goldmine .   And the food, what's not to love about sausages? And the fries? I'm going back just for those.  1. THE SAUSAGES: I sampled these 3, all in the currywurst style (sans bun):  - chicken: tasty - beef with coriander: juicy with strong beef flavour but could've used more coriander - lamb merquez: very tasty, best of the 3  2. THE FRIES: I sampled both regular and duck-fat...  - regular: incredible! (the 'large' is plenty for 2 people) - duck-fat: definitely had a distinct flavour, but too rich for me - imo, not worth the extra price (and calories, i'd imagine)  3. DIPPING SAUCES: The 3 dipping sauces I tried were all excellent: garlic-chive, chipotle, and...pesto'ish(?)  As for the value factor....is it over-priced? Maybe (the beers definitely are), but that's the dining scene in Toronto, isn't it? But never mind --  this concept and fun atmosphere, along with the beautiful, wood communal tables, glossy red brick wall and the 'field' of lights above, are enough to get me back there a second time. Mmm..sausages..."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and an interesting selection of sausages. Glad to see they do the currywurst. If you have ever been to Berlin, you'll know what I'm talking about.  This is the only place in the area that serves it."}
{"text":"Slow, indifferent service at the food counter. Lack of acknowledgement and service at the bar. Staff busy talking to friends rather than serving customers. Food is ok.  Give this one a miss and try one of Toronto's quality bars nearby."}
{"text":"Duck fries are a must!  Beer hall, so you'll have to get beer and beverages yourself. Different from the \"king west\"  atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pretty good sausages and some interesting choices! My favorite is the Kranjska sausage and the duck fat fries are to die for! Good selection of beer as well to wash it all down after. Friendly and courteous atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome place, really cool casual vibe and great food.  Must try the amazing fries with buttermilk ranch dip, I wish I could have it everyday."}
{"text":"I like Wvrst.  I go about once a week. I like going at lunch time because it is way more chill then the super loud, awesome crowd in the evenings.  That's my preference.  I am still surprised that my favourite sausage is the chicken and artichoke because I thought to myself, \"chicken in a sausage is such a cop out.\" But it's not.  It is delicious and moist and the bun is worth breaking my regular gluten-free diet for.  My husband loves the beer selection, they serve some really REALLY good cider. (I'm hooked on Stowford Press now).  The staff are super friendly, knowledgeable about the products (beer and sausage both) and make kick-ass recommendations.  Oh, and the restroom is clean.  Amazing.  MORE WVRST PLEASE."}
{"text":"Elk sausage. Good! Currywvrst. Good! Dirty duck fat fries... Perhaps everything should be cooked in duck fat, covered in onions, sweet peppers and jalapenos. Service was on top of everything. Love the care they take in maintaining their tap system."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dropped by for dinner today. Upon entering Wvrst we were greeted by someone who worked there who explained to us how it worked: you line up at the cashier to order and pay for your food. They give you a number, have a seat and wait for the food to be served to you.  Although there was only one group in line in front of us when we arrived, I can see this being a little inefficient when the line gets a little long, since there's only one cashier. The restaurant has communal/cafeteria-style seating and also has a bar lined with stools you can sit at. The beer is a bit on the expensive side, but they have a pretty good selection.   Anyways, I ordered the currywurst with their bratwvrst sausage (veal/pork/wine) for $6. It was served cut into slices, topped with a tomato curry sauce and served with two pieces of brown bread. I enjoyed this - it was something a little different.   We also ordered the venison sausage (red pepper/dijon) for $9. You get a choice of 2 toppings (the options are: caramleized onions, sauerkraut, sauteed jalapenos and sweet peppers). You also get a choice of it being served on a regular or whole wheat roll. This venison sausage absolutely blew my mind! It was so flavourful and tasted amazing. Highly recommended!  We also ordered a side of duck fat fries ($4.50 for small/$6.50 for large). The small comes with a choice of one dipping sauce and the large comes with two. We ordered a small and had the onion/black pepper mayo dip. Although they came out a little darker than I expected, I really enjoyed them! Nice and crispy without being burnt. Yum!  Overall, a great concept and a great experience. I'll definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"The duck fat fries with dipping sauce is simply amazing!!!  Super selection of sausages from traditional ocktoberfest to kangaroo."}
{"text":"This place is a \"sausage fest\" and by that I mean that's all that's on the menu.  There are plenty of sociable young women there if you thought I meant something else.  If you have no ethical problems consuming Kangaroo sausage, and aren't hanging with easily-offended Vegan friends, this is the only place I know of in which you can try it.  However the Wild Boar sausage is tastier.  Toronto still needs a real German restaurant, but this is a fun place to drink litre beers, in a modern atmosphere.  If you find the Guu Izakaya restaurants, which are similar in atmosphere, fun, you will like this place.  If you find the izakayas \"loud\" or \"annoying\" this place may not be for you."}
{"text":"First time trying a place that specialize in sausages. When I arrive at night, it was quite dim and got me feeling sleepy. Also realize that its great lighting if they burnt the food, it covers it up a bit.  Tried their Elk Sausage on a bun with sweet peppers and sauteed onions. I had the Rabbit currywurst option 2. And shared a large ducky FAT fries! First time experiencing that, and truth be told...I didn't notice any real difference. The Elk if I were to eat it other way instead of just sausage would be more different experience than having it in a sausage version. Same goes for Rabbit. Duck Fat Fries were the same reminders of Hero Burger fries.  I did like the mayo sauce dippers to compliment the sausage or fries, and I really enjoyed my beverage which was a vanilla cream soda! This is like eating picnic inside. The portion is not very average, and would feed someone better that is not hungry, so be prepared to fork out more dough if you want your fill!  This was an experience, and I would not travel to come back to this joint unfortunately.   Plus side is they have many options on sausages and their drinks are nice options as well."}
{"text":"Cafeteria style tables, really lively but cozy atmosphere (indoor barbecue picnic feel). Line moves quickly for the lunch crowd, but be prepared for a slight wait as all sausages are cooked to order which means they come tasty and delicious. Recommend the curry wvrst, simply because the sauce is delicious, great combination of sweet and spicy."}
{"text":"Great Beer Hall with with cool ambiance. Nice causal atmosphere.   Food option is limited to gourmet sausages, with an amazing variety of meats. Very delicious stuff. Extensive beer choice too.   Solid option. I often visit mostly because of the ambiance, great place for some casual drinks with friends or colleagues.   _______ My Reviews:  1 = Never again, stay far away  2 = Not a great dining option 3 = Not my first choice but will make an exception to come back if it's the popular vote 4 = Solid restaurant with high potential to return 5 = Exceptional"}
{"text":"Great selection of sausage and beer. I had the Kaas specialty sausage with cheese- delicious. The fries in duck fat with the house sauce are the best I've ever had. Bartenders know their beers and take pride in letting you sample until you find exactly the right one (s)!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times now - before a sports game with the guys or just hanging out with my wife. My wife and I both enjoy it. I've tried several of their sausages but the dirty duck fat fries are a must whenever I go. The sausages are good with some great options for toppings. The buns have a nice toast to them without being crusty on the outside. Whenever I have a sausage I typically go for the peppers and onions for toppings and rely on the jalapeños on the dirty duck fat fries for the extra kick. I finish it off with some good old prepared mustard and I'm off to the races.   I prefer my food reasonably priced and not overly fancy - rustic with a twist. So naturally I enjoy going here before a game as a twist to the sausage vendors on the street.   I'm not much of a craft beer person so I can't comment on the quality of their offerings but each time I've been it seems to be busy at the bar. They have a fairly decent selection of bottles and draught. They also offer beer flights and the selection is always changing."}
{"text":"Starting off with the bad - I'm not a big fan of the noisy dining area. But if you go off busy time it's pretty quiet and in the summers the tiny patio offers some respite. By far some of the best sausage I've ever had.  Personally love the wild boar - and the duck fat fried fries are some of the best in the city. Good selection of beers and overall great experience."}
{"text":"Amazing hot dogs and they have a lot of variety of sausages. Different dipping sauce and the fries are good as well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I came on a Saturday night and tried the dirty duck fat fries with raclette cheese + the chorizo, Oktoberfest, and calabrese sausage all on a bun with jalapeños and sautéed onions and boy did it not disappoint. Would definitely come here again and try out some new craft beers/ciders. Love the casual + lively atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Tasty sausage, great beer selection, casual seating, great time :)"}
{"text":"Have been here once, had the Boerewors sausage, fries and dipping sauce (maple/rosemary, chipotle). Pretty good, but I've gotta say the dipping sauces were the most flavourful of the foods I ate. So while I've had better sausages, I like the idea of this place a lot. Loved the beer list, too. I'd like to go back again and give a few other menu items a try before completely denouncing or falling in love with the place.    Also, be prepared for a lot of noise, so don't think you're going to be able to have drawn out conversations here."}
{"text":"Essentially an indoor beer garden, Wvrst has an awesome vibe, good crowd, and great food. It has very long picnic benches from one end to the other, so you can mix and mingle with your own group, or sometimes even the group beside you.  Their sausages are top notch and TASTY!! The server a huge section of common sausages like Chorizo or Octoberfest, but they also have a fancy selection of wild game meat such as Kangaroo.  Oh, and the fries, sooo good!  Their beer selection isn't huge but sufficient, and not your common brews. Also one of the few bars in Toronto that offer you a 1 litre stein, drink up Toronto!!"}
{"text":"Hi All!  The wife & I are back in Canada to visit friends & family, and found this very neat \"Beer Garden\" restaurant nestled in the West End of King Street.  The beer hall atmosphere and the range of pleasing sausages, and amazing duck fat fries really hit the mark!  The portions of food are good and are more than enough to fill.  The view of the kitchen is clear with no obstruction so you can see your food prepared.  I like that kind of transparency in my food preparation.  The place is clean.  I love the bench style seating which only further greases the social connectivity.  There is no over bearing music, nor the constant din of 4,000 TV screens tuned to a myriad of sports events - just awesome beers - awesome food - and an awesome atmosphere.  You can catch the Leafs though, when they are at home - and there is even a raffle for Leafs Tickets for that home game. It is also a slight departure from normal dining, where like a beer garden, you walk up, place your order then shimmy on over to the next seat on the bench...  Suds delivered almost immediately, and the food not too long afterwards.  They have their processes on lock - so you can focus on what next interesting beer or sausage you want to try.  If you want a large menu with pasta & steaks, this is not the place.  If you want a wide range of flavourful beer, some awesome fries and an amazing range of sausage & brats, get here now!"}
{"text":"Wurst is in my opinion ok. As a German, I can tell that this place is trying to be similar to a German 'beer hall' however the sausages, and especially the curry wurst is far from what the original tastes. However, they serve my favourite beer, which is Kölsch, and that saved my night. :)"}
{"text":"I got the duck fat fries with chipotle sauce. Not really impressed and would not get that again. I may come back to try the sausage."}
{"text":"Wvrst offers an interesting vibe. It feels part hipster, part artisan, part rustic. Hah have I confused you yet? When it comes down to it, Wvrst serves sausages and beer; and they do it well. The place is visually appealing (kind of clean minimalist, yet trendy) and is furnished with communal tables. The staff there are friendly and helpful (they're also what gives it that hipster vibe, which I don't mind).  I had the Bison sausage (hint of maple and blueberry) on a bun with onions and peppers. My gf had currywurst with bratwurst and we shared duck fat fries. The Bison was great, and the maple really came through subtly. My gf really liked the currywurst (she's German and said it tasted just like in Berlin). The duck fat fries were kind of disappointing. It more likely reflects the fact that neither of us really know what duck fat tastes like or would do to the fries, but they tasted like plain fries.  Overall, the service was friendly and fun. The food was great and I've been planning on coming back."}
{"text":"Wvrst was fantastic for a couple friends and I on a Thursday night!  The layout was fun - order at the kitchen, pay for it, grab a drink at the bar, and sit at the picnic benches.  The servers were great - they warned us that Kangaroo is 'just so you can have Kangaroo' and that the Large Duck Fat Fries are good for three.  I got Duck, my dudes got Pheasant and Chorizo. Smiles all around. With a beer and two sody-pops, it was under $50, and we were well full.  Will visit again."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in Toronto. Fun atmosphere. I've had at least a dozen different sausages here. I recommend the bison and lamb. The duck fat fries are completely worth it."}
{"text":"I personally had a really good experience. The place is really nice for just having a casual drink and dinner with friends. They don't mix drinks so if u like a rum n coke or something similar, this is not the place for you. They only serve beer (of which they have a huge variety), jagermeister (no jager bombs) and bourbon. The sausages menu is so damn exotic. Foodies are in for a treat. I'm personally a vegetarian so I was personally happy to have 3 choices of vegetarian sausages. Will go back sometime for sure"}
{"text":"Not a single bad thing to say! The food is always delicious (love the currywurst), there is a great selection of beer and cider, and the service is always friendly and efficient! You've no sooner finished your plate or glass and someone is there to take it out of your way.   And even though it may say not kid-friendly above, that couldn't be farther from the truth. Sure, it can be a little loud, but each time I've been there have been children of all ages and there have never been any problems. Very family friendly, so don't let having little ones with you stop you from popping in."}
{"text":"Nice sausages and toppings. I do wish the cooks could have exercised a little more quality control. A charred sausage like that should not have been served. Docking a star off a four star experience because of that."}
{"text":"I came here because I was watching The Layover with Anthony Bourdain on Netflix, and he did an episode on Toronto. Wvrst was featured on it and I really watched to try it out. Lots of beer to chose from as well as sausages. I went with the chorizo with a side order of dirty duck fries. Yep potato french fries done in duck fat. I dunno how, but it just works and tastes great. The only odd thing i found was the seating style. it's like large picnic tables where you sit where you want, when you're ready walk up to the counter and place your order. they give you a number and they'll bring out the food to you in trays. Did i mention they had 3 kinds of mustard. I will need to come back with some friends of mine."}
{"text":"Simple, delicious, and doing one thing very very well.  While you could argue that the bill was high for a brat & some brew, I think it's well worth the price.  The only reason for not giving five stars was the volume of the music.  We all were yelling across our thin tables.  You're a german beer house, not a night club."}
{"text":"One of the best places to get amazing food! All kinds of beers and great atmosphere! Who knew duck fries could taste so good!"}
{"text":"I love me some sausages! When I want sausages in my mouth I come to this place ;p  No, but seriously though. It is a GREAT place for sausages. The first time I came here was amazed by all the exotic meat sausages they had: elk, rabbit, venison, bison, duck, etc. Last time I had the wild boar sausage and yesterday I had the kangaroo sausage. You heard right! Kangaroo! It was really good,  though I dont know how to describe it.   I also had the duck fat fries and there's NO WAY I regret ordering that! It was just soooooooooo good! And I had them with the maple rosemary sauce which is just...just...amazing! Just writing this review makes my mouth water and want more of those sausages and fries.   They have lots of options for beers and a few ciders on tap. Mondays they have some drinks for $5!   All in all, amazing place. Totally recommend it. Great for big groups of people too."}
{"text":"Well it is expensive, but it is a cool place.  Best fries (In duckfat) ever. Great vibe.  Oktoberfest made in Torontonian style."}
{"text":"Really good fries. Their sausages are good and they have a wide variety but nothing amazing."}
{"text":"Really well thought out place. Unique to Toronto.  Servers are very nice, good food good beer.  Best of all, they have very good options for vegetarians. And not just one thing you can have, you got some choice. Got a veggie sausage and fries. Really delicious.  5 stars for the unique vibe it provides. Perfect place to go with a group of friends for a bite and some beer."}
{"text":"WVRST is one of those hidden gems of the King West area that a lot of people tend not to know about. The sausage selection here is quite large, and even provides some unique choices such as Kangaroo and Wild Boar sausages. No order at WVRST is complete though without a side of their fries! I'd personally recommend the Dirty Duck fries, which comes loaded with veggies and their homemade sauce, but their plain Duck fat fries also do the job as well.  If you're not a fan of a loud environment, I'd recommend checking out WVRST during lunch, otherwise dinner to late-night. Overall, WVRST is a unique experience with great food!"}
{"text":"Any place that has 15 types of sausage and Maker's Mark on tap is going to pull me in from the street, when plans to eat at Weslodge were spoiled by attitude and a story of \"full capacity for the entire night at 7pm.\"  On a Friday night at 8:30, we waited less than 15 minutes to get into Wvrst and were fed fries in line, there is little more I need to make me happy :)  Guinea Fowl Sausage (with cheddar and asparagus) was very well cooked and juicy, nestled in a bed of saurkraut, wrapped in a sweet white bun all dipped in black pepper and onion sauce. I'm so proud of this choice.  You'll find every type of game imaginable in sausage form, plus your basics and even veggie sausages. The duck fat fries are incredible and there are many fine brews on tap to wash it all down.   The communal style seating is squishy fun, people come and go quickly, so I recommend scoping out a seat while you are in line ordering. Dont be stuck holding your food with no place to sit!"}
{"text":"When you walk into Wvrst you feel as though you have stepped into a portal that has led you to a beer garden in Germany.  The atmosphere is warm with strings of white lights and communal picnic tables only!  It was our first time but the menu gives you a fantastic selection and a step by step of how to order your meal. I got the tofu and basil while my boyfriend got the bison hot dog with caramelized onions and peppers and a pint of Weihenstephan each(Most delicious German wheat beer ever and quite rare to find on tap anywhere in Toronto). It took about 10 minutes for our food and it was delicious!  The veggie dog is easily the best veggie dog I have eer tried! It has a meat like hard texture without the meat *thumbs up*! Servers were very friendly!"}
{"text":"Can get noisy at peak hours is my only issue other than that the place has a very diverse selection of sausages. Absolutely love the boar sausage which has tea and mushroom in it. If you never had fries deep fried in duck fat and are curious to try they are awesome!"}
{"text":"Tried and tested, Wvrst is one of those cool, hip places on King West where you can almost always grab a seat without reservations. I've been there over a dozen times and I can't seem to stray past the Boerwoers (sp?) - the South African sausage  and a nice, cool glass of Beaus- which they often have on draft. It can sometimes be a bit loud and taxing on your back (they have long bench seating), but If you're looking for a spot to impress people from out of town on King West- you've struck gold at Wvrst!"}
{"text":"A lots kind of craft beer label, so people who love beer, pretty sure enjoy.  However sausage is not so good..."}
{"text":"This place is great if you go with a group of friends.  Awesome sausage to try and lots of energy. Even though there may be a lineup, it goes super quick.   Be careful about ordering the fries - the large size can literally fill up 6 people; it's enormous.  Overall, it's something different and is definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"When I first walked in here, it reminded me of a school cafeteria. It has a relaxed food court setting. You order your food, and then you bring it to any seat you like.    FOOD: -wild boar sausage -elk sausage  -duck fat fries  I enjoyed the sausages , they were tasty. However I couldn't tell the difference between the duck fat fries and regular fries from elsewhere.  My friend said he can taste the duck fat in the fries though. But the fries were good regardless, even though I can't taste the duck fat.   OVERALL: I will return to try more items"}
{"text":"4/5! great place to go after a night out on King Street. Much better than the corner hotdog stand. we tried the pork & lamb traditional sausages and both were good. Make sure you get the Curry & Mint dipping sauce - it's delicious. This place is great for large groups and beer-lovers as well."}
{"text":"If you want to try any kind of meat..this is the place you should go to.. I tired the Rabbit sausage.. Just amazing.. Only for people who can handle to see so much meat there!!"}
{"text":"Pretty straightforward. Nice change of pace to eat some gourmet sausages. Had the Elk, it was delicious. Duck fat fries were okay but the different sauces to go with them were a treat.  Swell ambiance inside - maybe a little hipsteresque but not overpoweringly so. The staff were quite helpful and quick.  Would have liked a bit more guidance on beers and the sizes they come in - saw some guys with these great big steins and I had a dinky little stemmed glass - delicious beer dont get me wrong - I just wanted the full on beer hall experience."}
{"text":"Grant was the best bartender I have ever be served by. He knows his stuff. Not only can he recommend a beer for your taste buds but he can tell you the history behind every single brewery. If you LOVE craft beers, this is the guy to come see!!!"}
{"text":"The name of this place is very misleading. The food is not even close to what German sausage is like. The portions are very small and overpriced. We went there on a Saturday night and the place was extremely loud and disorganized."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful!  It really does have the German beer hall vibe with communal tables and a wonderful selection of beers both German and local, local ciders, and wine.  We were only in the Toronto area for two days and  both days we stopped in.  We had the duck fries.  Get it with the maple/rosemary dipping sauce :)"}
{"text":"After waiting for a while to try this place, I finally had the opportunity. Maybe I built it up too much in my head, but I came away feeling disappointed. I tried the kangaroo sausage (curry version). It came cut up with a piece of toast and sauce on the side. For $9 it was pretty sad looking. I also had the opportunity to try the chorizo, which I preferred, in taste. All in all, I think this place is great for a schmoozing opportunity or catching up with friends over a cold beer and apps."}
{"text":"Go up the stairs to the painted brick wall, and open the door to the most delicious (cheap) meal you will find in the neighbourhood.   Food: Calabrese and Italian sausages (currywvrst, $7/ea), duck fat fries (large, $6.5 incl 2 dips).   The fries are OUT OF THIS WORLD delicious. They're gloriously magnificent. I want to just lie in a comfy couch with a KFC family-size cardboard bucket full of these crispy outside, soft and piping hot on the inside fries. Dips gave an extra kick -- ask for suggestions. Sausages were decent, and the curry-tomato sauce gave the sausages some needed moisture. Beer selection was interesting and satisfying (try their roasted-flavour coffee stout... can't for the life of me remember the name of it).  Ambiance/Service: Everyone's very friendly, attentive, and invariably laid back, and this attitude is delivered through the similarly relaxed atmosphere. The tiny decorative lights strung along the ceiling, the communal picnic benches, whole grain mustard on the tables; you just can't go wrong with this place!  Overall: Love, love, LOVE! I'm a big fan. Will return to try the more \"exotic\" sausage flavours, such as elk, kangaroo, or wild boar."}
{"text":"Not bad, but really doesn't deserve the crazy high ratings people give it. It's a cool place to have a few pints, but the food is mediocre."}
{"text":"Wow!  I don't recall having customer service this good in a long time.  COMMUNAL SEATING, EVENTS & OKTOBERFEST I had eaten there w/ friends and really enjoyed the vibe with their hip, casual, picnic table communal tables, so I had tried to book an event there.  Sadly, due to a relative passing I had to cancel the event.  I can't commend their manager, Bram, enough;  He was willing to work with me far more than any of the dozen other places I explored.  After asking his advice for my budget, he guided me towards non-October dates so I could get a better rate; naturally, they are hopping for Oktoberfest all month, so it's a bit harder to book the entire place during peak hours that month.  Look forward to checking out their Oktoberfest in the future!  They will let you book a section of the open concept space or rent the entire space for a fixed minimum food/beverage fee that is pretty reasonable.    DESSERT Though they don't really offer much in the way of desserts, they had plans to start working w/ a neighbour bakery to expand offerings for the regular menu & for events.  FOOD Their menu is pretty much traditional all the way to exotic sausages on buns or as curry wvrst -- sliced without a bun w/ a curry ketchup like is super popular in Germany.    DRINK They have a wide range of not-your-average-joe domestic and import beers and YES really good wine options, too.  Bartenders seem to know their stuff and are enthusiastic and can accurately describe various beverages (very pleasant surprise these days for fairly casual fare).  SERVICE We looked at their deli case to select sausages and purchase them at the counter.  Then, food was brought to our table.  We bellied up to the bar to buy our drinks separately then carried them back to our table, though, I think you can also buy it when you get your food.   PARKING Sort of crowded street parking that I recall, so I recommend walking, biking, or street car.  PAYMENT Where else can you buy a sausage and pay for it w/ credit card?  Not likely when getting street meat from a stand."}
{"text":"Duck fat fries. Yes please.  I had the dirty fries with the curry on the side.  Very good.  I also had a cider flight which was very reasonably priced, but i couldnt drink one of the 6 (it tasted like potpourri).  I tasted three sausages, the calabrese was good, the rabit was ok, and the chicken and turkey had a strange texture which i really didn't like.  Overall it was cool inside and the staff was very friendly"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere at Wvrst.  It's a great open space to grab a group and have a few drinks.  They have everything from the \"purist\" sausage fan (ie: good old fashioned beef) to the adventurous (kangaroo anyone?!?!).  My boyfriend and I ordered the guinea fowl, and I ordered the duck.  We also ordered the lamb to share.  The sausages themselves were great.  You could taste the individual ingredients.  My only wish was that they had better toppings.  You only have a choice of 2 items between sautéed jalapeños, peppers, onions and sauerkraut.  Would have loved maybe some mushrooms or pickles or even a different variety of sauces as an option (rather than paying extra for dippers).  I'd definitely go again for after work drinks and a snack, but probably wouldn't go for a sit down meal."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The sausages are full of flavor and the fries are delicious. They also carry a variety of sauces that are a great complement for the sausage. Ambiance is nice if you want to share a beer with friends."}
{"text":"The restaurant has long tables (cafeteria style, but better looking), and you just grab a seat anywhere after you've ordered your food. They bring the food out to you when it's ready. Be kind to your seat neighbours as you're pretty much sharing a table though. :)  Their sausages are amazing. I tried a few different ones, and a few of them I did as currywurst.  The buns for their sausages are perfect and go well with the nice bite of each sausage. The currywurst sauce has the perfect ratio it curry to tomato taste. I got two different currywursts though. One had the sauce on the side, the other was all over it.   My friend wanted to try a sausage made with elk or kangaroo... I shied away from it. I'm sure they're delicious, they just don't seem that appetizing to me.   The duck fat fries are unreal. Like so amazingly delicious. I could eat them all in like five minutes.   I also ordered a beer sampler. They have some really nice beers/ciders on tap from all around the world.   The staff are pretty friendly and VERY good at clearing plates/glasses as soon as they are empty.   I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It is one of the best places to have sausage in Toronto. The selection is WIDE. The \"boerwors\" is insanely delicious if you want beef. The \"calabrese\" is also amazing. All the sauses are homemade and taste amazing. They also have a wide selection of beers. The environment is nice and trendy. Very casual. I love how they have different styles for each order.. Their products do not contain any growth hormone and they are gluten free ..you can def go to this place for some food and drinks and hit clubs or lounges in the neighborhood  on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"Have been a few times but dropped in on Wednesday night which meant it was quieter than usual. Had the duck fat fries with the black pepper and onion dipping sauce which worked out really well.  Love the beer selection so much and try to move around the offerings. Had an Aphrodite from Quebec which was dark, flavorful, and small. Hit the spot though.  Went with the Boerewors with sautéed jalapeños in honor of Lizl Van Zyl. Perfection."}
{"text":"Stopped by Wvrst after a long drive, and boy we could not have been happier. The long German beer hall tables enable a wonderful cozy and comfortable atmosphere. The friendly man waiting for a friend sitting next to us, struck up a great conversation with us and gave the best advice on what to order. This is clearly a place that people are passionate about, and want to try over and over again. After the patrons advice, my friend and I ordered the venison with jalapeños and wild boar with grilled onions and sauerkraut. Plus a side of duck fat fries with a chive & garlic dipping sauce. Everything was amazing. They also have one of the most impressive Danish beer list that I have seen in a while. After studying abroad in Denmark, I can tell you that they have some special beers at Wvrst, Mikkeller beers are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Wvrst had been on my list of places to check out for a few months and I've recently had a chance to go a few times.  As other reviewers have pointed out, they've got some exotic meats (yes, kangaroo) and the place is inspired by iconic beer halls in Munich. Obviously, the place is nothing like an actual beer hall in Munich, but it's still a fun layout, especially if there's a mix of welcoming strangers at a table, that is a bit unique to Toronto.  Despite all of the options, I usually stick with the bratwurst (served in a bun with a heaping of sauerkraut, jalapenos and red/yellow peppers) and small fries. The bratwurst is good and doesn't taste that different than the bratwurst you'll find in Germany. Any time I've had it in Germany it comes alone, or with a slice of rye bread or a tiny bun that only fits a quarter of the sausage (without the jalapenos and red/yellow peppers, of course).  The regular fries are standard. If you get a dipping sauce, avoid the plain mayo and opt for something with some flavour.  What I dig about this place: the selection of imports in 1L beer steins and the vibe on a game night."}
{"text":"Still great! My friend and I came here to grab a bite.  She tried the rabbit and I tried the elk.  Both of us ordered the curry style, and so they gave it to us on the side, as they aren't supposed together, but it tastes delicious either way.  It was a nice day and the only thing that would make this place better is a patio!  I love coming here, and I would always recommend.  I love the flight of beer and for $12 it's a great price, and you get to try some different beers.  It's amazing!"}
{"text":"Upscale hotdogs. Gone twice. It's good, better than average, but not mind blowing. It's the kind of place where you eat and think ... if i was in charge I would have tweaked this and that. Because ultimately I never crave the food their selling unlike other restos in Toronto. It's very doable food at home.  got burnt crustini 2nd time I went. No apology, staff didn't really care. Meh. I will return if convenient."}
{"text":"Wvrst is a good looking place. 90% of it is made of aged wood or a reasonable facsimile. The communal tables are large enough that you can get cozy with and not have to fight for elbow room with strangers. Large windows give a really nice view of King Street if you'd like to people watch but you can just as easily shimmy to the southern end of the restaurant and stare at the kitchen.  I enjoyed the presentation of the beer taps at the bar. Someone has placed little kid style fridge magnet letters to indicate which brew is which because all of the taps are mounted on a sheet metal wall behind the bar. It's a neat design feature. Their list of beers is good but I think they could stand to lose one or two things. Church key and Hacker Pschorr are great but I was less than excited about seeing a $7 MGD and $10 for a litre of PBR but hey who am I to under estimate the poor drinking choices of others.  Our food was great. I had the bison, duck and fowl with an order of the duck frites. Delicious. All of it. My one concern was the sauces and I can't remember which ones I had unfortunately, but I didn't like any of them. There are three types of mustard and a ketchup at each table that were quite good if you're not interested in the sauces on the menu.  I would contest the idea that this is a \"hipster\" establishment for the simple reason that there was a wide variety of people there. A group of dentists were celebrating the launch of their website while a film shoot wrap party happened three tables over. Parents and children wearing baseball uniforms were scattered around after a Jays game and three stereotypical I.T. nerds sat at the table beside me. I only mention this because so many people seem to cringe at the suggestion that they've ended up in a hipster bar/restaurant/store/whatever and I would really like to see this place do well. They've worked hard to put together a great place with good food and it shows. If you judge them on their menu and customer service then I think you'll have a great time."}
{"text":"Wvrst is the WORST!  Seriously, this is one of the most terrible experiences I have had and is compelling me to write my first online review ever. We visited on a Saturday night and were treated in a total disrespectful manner.  It is such a shame too because this place has potential... like the awesome Standard Bier Garten in New York... but I will never be a patron at this establishment ever again.  To start, my friend asked for the IPA Red Razor, which was on the menu. The bartender told her she was all out and reccommended another IPA. When we sat down, my friend did not like her reccomendation (\"Worst beer I have ever had in my life\") - which is okay, not everyone has the same likes/pallate, when we went up to talk to the bartender - they were completely unflexible and just said \"Well EVERYBODY ELSE loves this beer\" -  insuinuating there was something wrong with her not liking it. In my opinion, because they did not have the beer as on their menu, and gave a reccommendation, it should have been a simple - \"Sorry about that - what else can I get for you instead?\" but we were treated in a way that left us walking away feeling insulted and belitteled.  It is just not the way you want your guests feeling. We were upset.  After getting our beers, we went to the kitchen to get some food. It was 12:01. They refused to serve us as the kitchen was closed. Some flexibility would have been appreciated here to as if we had ordered food first, not beers, we would've been there at 11:50 when the kitchen was open. To add insult to injury, fresh, hot plates were coming out of the kitchen for the next 10 minutes so its not like the fryers were turned off or anything.  If you like unaccomodating, rude staff with zero flexibility and that talk down to you - go to Wvrst. If you want an unpretentious, good time with friendly, helpful service go to Bier Market."}
{"text":"This is your regular lunch and dinner German restraunt . The atmosphere is low key. This place is informal. It is great! :)"}
{"text":"WVRST is everything it promises to be: a genuine sausage party in European tradition. Decorated like a very upmarket eastern european beer hall or pivovar by way of hipster west coast design, the large open room is filled with long simple wooden tables and stools. Shared seating is the order of the day. Walk to the back of the room, pick from a variety of sausage types and treatments (either in a bun or a la currywurst as is vogue in Germany) and a drink from their incredibly well outfitted tap list, pay the nice lady and grab a number. Your meal will be ferried to you as you sit and chat.  The sausage is high quality, bursting with flavour, and the toppings and dipping sauces are obviously made on site and with good care. Spicy is spicy, sweet isn't cloying, and the frites are done in classic Belgian style: crispy on the outside, warm through the middle. The beer was a little cold, but that just gave me some more time to contemplate life.  I wouldn't take a first date here, but this will obviously be a great spot for a casual lunch or post-work drink and nosh with friends. Lots of friends, and when it's crowded (I was told that dinner is busier than lunch) I suspect you may end up making some new friends while there."}
{"text":"It's delicious, but I wished I ordered the original vegan sausage coz the black bean sausage is too spicy for me. I like the ambience, it's loud but I can handle it. The lady who cashed me out should've told me that the sausage I was ordering was too spicy.. I didn't enjoy my sausage."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm a fan. I was a bit skeptical of the concept--sausages? That's it? But with the eclectic array of creatures to sample, the exceptional duck fat fries, and the myriad of accompanying dipping sauces--they nailed it!   I tried the kangaroo sausage, a small order of duck fat fries and the maple/rosemary dip. This combination was incredible. My friend and I were so pleased, we decided to try the currywurst which also delivered (especially if you know what to expect with a currywurst--it's not your standard sausage & bun combo, so don't expect that!).   The beer selection was great as well. Can't wait to come back and try the rest."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, fun menu, great beer selection ,very friendly staff! The \"beer hall\" atmosphere was really neat."}
{"text":"I had a few friends telling me to come here, raving about their weird selections of \"Game\" meat, which is basically stuff you shouldn't eat anywhere else, and their duck fat fries. Ten dollars for \"Game\" sausage, which is kangaroo (I had this), bison, and a lot of other weird things you wouldn't get anywhere else. The meat was dry, but interesting since I've never had kangaroo meat before, and it was a good experience, but it was just a hot dog - a really expensive one at that. It wasn't even as large as a street hot dog. Their duck fat fries weren't even anything special, just tasted like normal fries if anything. Come here I guess once to experience it, but other than that there's no point in craving this food - I mean I didn't have the beer maybe that's a reason why I didn't enjoy their high ratings."}
{"text":"I decided to go to Wvrst after hearing many positive reviews from my co-workers. The place itself is huge with communal seating. The service was alright except for the fact that the waiters kept trying to take our plates away (even though we weren't finish) and trying to get us to leave.   The food was actually quite good. I decided to try the boar sausage but they got my order wrong and gave me it with a bun (which became way too plain since it wasn't exactly what I ordered). The duck fat fries were really good which I would highly recommend it. My friend opted for an Italian sausage which he loved.  Overall, I thought that the food was very good (just they got my order wrong). And that even though it was getting busy, there really isn't a point in trying to rush your customers out when there is still plenty of food on the table."}
{"text":"Really great variety of unique meats and those fries are to die for!"}
{"text":"We went during lunch and had a fantastic meal. Especially liked the fermented vegetables. Duck fat French fries are unbelievably good"}
{"text":"Had some fantastic selection of food and all of it was unbelievable (especially their fries)! The service was great and so was the beer selection."}
{"text":"The best sausages in Toronto. Hands-down. A solid selection of craft brews on tap. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Went for a second time and thought I should update things.  Service is quick and accurate and they do check to make sure you meal is okay (important!).  I had the bison/blueberry/maple sausage with the rosemary maple sauce this time. The sausage was amazing but the sauce has no flavour other than just being sweet (didnt taste like maple). 1 sauce is complimentary with your meal, additional sauces are $1.   My wife had the bratwurst. She never had bratwurst before and she really liked it. She tried the chipotle sauce and it was excellent. All sauces are made in house and the chipotle is a clear winner. The flavour is excellent and theres little pieces of smoked poblano? pepper still in the sauce. Delicious.  After some thinking about it, I've decided that the duck fat fries are the best fries I've ever eaten I highly recommend getting an order when you go (plain so you can taste the flavour).   The bun that your sausage comes in is also one of the best I've ever had. Very fresh, soft and fluffy."}
{"text":"I love sausages and the variety is fun . Also love the variety of mustards . The fries are AMAZING but def a heart attack in a box. Place gets super loud when it's busy making it a difficult place to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Really crazy menu with different kinds of meats. I enjoyed their duck fat fries with the peppercorn dip."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing vibe! duck fat friest are a must! favourite sausage is the venison! wild boar is also really good and its cooked perfectly, spicy and a great texture. Kangaroo is a little on the dry side, nice to try just to say you had it but not up to par with the other game meats. Kangaroo hardly has any fat so what do you expect.  Place is amazing and love the bench tables structure. great for a lunch with coworkers or a night out before partying!"}
{"text":"Just as advertised! If your looking for an authentic German beer garden this is as close as you will find in the city of Toronto."}
{"text":"Guinea Fowl is a must. Hands down the best sausage in the world. And this comes from both myself and a well-fed Polish friend. Duck fat fries are the perfect compliment. Curry wurst is also a great option. Perfect flavour combinations. Not to mention an amazing beer selection.  If you are not driving, I recommend getting the 1 litre jug and stuffing yourself silly."}
{"text":"Last night a friend and myself decide to try Wvurst. I had been there before, after work before the kitchen was opened and had a couple of beers. Excellent beer selection in both draft and bottle.  The set-up is supposed to mimic a German beer hall. Rows of very clean picnic benches line the room and there are maybe 10 seats at the bar. That's where we sat.  We both ordered off the Game part of the menu. My friend had the Bison Sausage with blueberry maple and I had the Wild Boar sausage with mushroom and tea. We both thought they were excellent. I had a small plain fries with mine which was quite enjoyable.   The service there is excellent, and I found the servers and bartenders to be very friendly, personable and efficient.  We were there around 8 so I am unsure how long a line-up to order food would be when it is crowded. Then again some places take forever to come to your table to serve you, so this might work better.  Wvurst is a sausage place and beer hall with a great atmosphere and vibe. It is a place I will definitely be returning too."}
{"text":"How this place could have anything less than a perfect rating is beyond me. Love the atmosphere and food!!! Blueberry boar sausage is a fav. Duck fat fries (size small) to share is more than enough."}
{"text":"Not being a fan of sausages, I had some misgivings about visiting this restaurant, but the buzz around it was worth checking out.    The set up is quite unique, with communal tables and benches arranged in long rows. It resembles a German beer hall, but there are no busty German waitresses holding a dozen of beer steins in each hand. The decor is sparse and utilitarian, and the acoustics of the place make it difficult to carry a conversation (although I saw plenty of people talking).    You place your order at the cashier in the far end of the hall, you pay, and then you choose seats at one of the tables.  Your food and drinks are brought to you when ready.  The menu consists exclusively of sausages.  There's more than a dozen varieties to choose from: beef, pork, poultry, game and vegetarian - all apparently organic and made on premises.  You can have your sausage served in one of two styles: currywurst - sliced, served with a tomato-curry sauce and a piece of farmer's bread, or hot-dog style in a bun. This can be accompanied by a side of French fries, optionally fried in duck fat, although the duck flavour is hardly noticeable.  The results are not bad. The two sausages we had (krjanska and boerwurst) were very flavourful and the curry sauce made the combination quite unique.  The variety of dipping sauces for fries is a nice touch.  The beer selection is decent, including some local brews and a few good German beers.   One thing that was missing was a side of veggies with your sausage.  I craved coleslaw or even just a pickle to cut through the meatiness and fat.    In what may have been a sign of teething problems in a new restaurant, my order seems to have been misplaced and I had to wait over half an hour for my meal.  The general manager however took good care of us when notified and we ended up with extra dipping sauces for our fries and a voucher for a complimentary sausage on our next visit.  Hopefully those service kinks will get ironed out. (Although it's unusual that you have to pay AND TIP before you've been served.)"}
{"text":"I am German. I grew up on sausages. In university I used to garnish strange looks from  roomates with a veggie dog version of CurryWvurst, although with more heat and less curry. Plus, I add pickles. Yum.  Sausages were well priced at $6. I tried a bite or two of the SO's Kranjska (Pork and Margoram).  I wish I had ordered a vegetarian sausage, but as I was not very hungry I didn't think I could polish off an entire one. The Veggie ones look interesting. Next time!  Lots of fun dips for the fries, some were better than others.. but very original flavours.   it is what is is. Beer, Fries, Sausages, Communal tables - and they do it well. The atmosphere is great. Decent prices. The only real negative was the \"Flying Monkey\" beer which was awful."}
{"text":"This place was reviewed favorably by guide books and yelp, so while in town for the weekend I checked it out. My husband ordered the wild boar with sauerkraut and sweet pepper, it was vey good. But I preferred my Standard brat (the type that started with a K) prepared curry style.  Good beer selection. Nice atmosphere, but a little loud. Probably jot worth walking too far out of the way for, but if you are nearby it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 6 and they said we had to wait. OK but problem is they don't  give out numbers and they dont take your name down. You just have to wait. OK we did but then they tell us to wait outside cause they have to keep the area clear. The place was half full with most of the tables reserved and it was raining outside.  We said goodbye! I would give it a zero but seems like the lowest is 1 star."}
{"text":"German beer hall style space with a wide beer selection. It's a relatively pricey beer but the sausage variety is great. Many game and traditional options. Personally I did not notice the difference between their duck fat fries and normal fries. It's ideal for larger group events. I liked the atmosphere and would come again."}
{"text":"I always take my friends here. Their sausage toppings are delicious, the currywurst is rich and smokey, and the dipping sauces are to die for. Surprisingly good value for a student budget too. Make sure to order the dirty duck fat fries, otherwise... did you even go to WVRST?"}
{"text":"I've been to Wvrst several times and have always had an enjoyable experience. The staff has always been super friendly and my meals have always come out quite quickly, though I've never been at peak dining hours. Word of warning: the large fries are LARGE. I highly recommend the maple rosemary dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Big big glasses of beer! 1L of glasses ahoy! Great place for pre-drinking before heading to next round. Quite a few selections of ciders too.   And of course not to forget the huge selection of sausages!"}
{"text":"duck fat fries, venison and elk sausage were AMAZING... go here you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! I stumbled upon Wvrst by chance after I left EFS. we were a party of 4 people (all new in town) and we decided to stop here because it seemed a restaurant with fast service.  We had no idea we were about to enter a meat-lover paradise where you can personalize your experience. Something very cool about this place is that you can choose your own sausage out of 10-15 different types. I'm always open to try new food so I decided to go with something different than pork/chicken/lamb.  They have a good selection of \"Game sausages\": it ranges from duck to venison, rabbit and kangaroo. I was so excited (and undecided), so many choices!!! At the end I took the Elk Sausage with sweet peppers and sauteed onions. It was delicious! The meat was tasty and juicy (not overcooked), the topping were perfectly seasoned.  I don't give 5 stars for 3 reasons: duck fries, beer prices and noise level. We ordered regular fries and duck fat fries. there was no difference between the two, same spices and same flavor. why should I pay more for duck fat fries if I don't taste it? (on the plus side, each order of fries comes with a dipping sauce: the maple/rosemary and the chipotle were phenomenal!). they have a great selection of local and imported beers (fantastic!!). it is true that they are often 500ml or more but they are insanely expensive $20+ per beer. too much!! Finally, the noise level was a bit too high. We were lucky to find a spot in a corner table near the entrance but in the middle of the room it would have been difficult to have a simple conversation."}
{"text":"Love the European/German ambience... Very opened interior (no walls) Cafeteria tables + stools Hot dogs were okay All sausages are home made but nothing really special.. the bun tasted different, tho. A bit pricy in my opinion... almost $10 each hot dog"}
{"text":"So good I almost wish I lived further away. Love the selection of mayo. They only do a few things, but they do them excellently."}
{"text":"the food was fantastic, the food wait time and the extremely loud atmosphere not so much. if you want to hear the person next to you, this is not your place. ice cream was great."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Duck fat fries were totally worth it."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian I have to say this is one of my favourite places to go for meatless sausages. They always seem to have different varieties available whenever I'm there which is awesome -- I love that I get to try something different every time :) Sometimes the sausages can be a bit dry, but it's fine when you throw some sweet peppers and sautéed onions into the mix - yum!"}
{"text":"The set up of this place is like an indoor Biergarten. We went on a Thursday night around 8 with a party of 4 and had no issues finding a spot to get seated. But the place is quite popular and was busy that night.  We ordered a bunch of different beers and a beer sampler (you get 6 samples for 14$, but you can't choose the beers you want to sample)   For food, we got the large dirty fries - they were so delicious and an absolutely must order at WVRST. We also got a bunch of different sausage - merguez, elk, curry wurst - all were very flavorful and delish!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome - they really know their sausages.  The sausages are potent and there are a variety of different meats that are enhanced with different flavours.  Definitely will try and have them all -- not at once.  The eat-in area reminds me of a German beer hall.  It's nice, simple and clean, with long tables.  You might be sitting in with a lot of people enjoying sausage and beer.  No better way to have fun when eating.  The service is attentive, friendly and informative.  They'll recommend a good beer with a good sausage.  Prices are fair.  Will return - multiple times.  4 stars for sure."}
{"text":"The authenticity is what really hits home.  Keg of water? Hellz yah!  The sausages are nicely done. Although the toppings could have been flavored a bit more. The fries are definitely worth trying. The home-made mayo sauces are amazing =) Definitely check this place out if you can"}
{"text":"Originally came here because beer advocate said they had great selection of beers on tap. Very happy with the beer but was blown away by the food. So many choices for sausages (I got venison and my boyfriend got rabbit) with great toppings. Even the dipping for the fries were amazing. Great place and the long tables make it easy to socialize with others. If I am ever back in Toronto this will be my first stop."}
{"text":"THE FOOD  Very good sausages that cost a little to a lot too much.   Apparently a good beer selection but again overpriced.   You can get your sausage sliced with a seasoned ketchup or on a bun with 2 of 4 possible add-ons including sauerkraut.   4 dipping sauces available.   SERVICE NOTES  Order at the counter and then sit down and wait for your food & beer at communal picnic-style tables.   On the menu they ask you to tip the \"servers\" who bring your food out to you after you've ordered it and clear your tray after you're done. I think this is ridiculous and choose not to tip. I encourage you all to do the same. Seriously, they're not really helping in any way. The counter is 10 feet away, a person with extremely long arms could do that job from a standing position. Incidentally, I would tip that person..."}
{"text":"Vous voulez manger un merguez frite à Toronto ? C'est ici qu'il faut venir, car vous y trouverez toutes les variétés de saucisses pour votre hot-dog haut de gamme !"}
{"text":"We came here for my boyfriend's birthday in June. There were eight of us so we each got some different stuff to try! Most of the group got Italian, because Germany lost the semi to Italy in the Euro that day...ah sportsmanship. Two of them got the currywvrst and two got them loaded up with toppings. Both ways were delicious.   My boyfriend and I got ventured out and got two of the \"game\" sausages; I got duck and he went for guinea fowl. Now, in my opinion, you can never go wrong with duck, and this time was no exception. However, my boyfriend's sausage (I know, I know) was flippin' amazing! (That's what she said) But yeah definitely the best one of all the ones we ordered. I also tried the beer pairing that went with the duck sausage, but was disappointed. It was a stout which I'm not crazy about anyways (I wasn't aware that it was a stout... derp) so I'm not one to judge the quality, but next time I'll stick to King's.  We also had two orders of the dirty fries; one was duck fat one was regular. Both were delicious but we could really taste a huge difference between the duck and the regular.  The atmosphere was really neat; Subway wall with the wooden picnic bench style tables (I am all for shared seating), along with really good lighting (always a nice touch) made the place come together really well.  Overall, great spot, great atmosphere, and great food! We'll be back. Oh, and definitely a good one for groups"}
{"text":"headed to wvrst friday night - it was busy but there wasn't a long wait for seating space for 2 ppl.   the atmosphere is loud, noisy and packed with ppl nursing large beer mugs. it's definitely a place to get your beer on!  set with wooden benches and dim lights strung in rows across the ceiling, it gives a bustling patio party feel.  we ordered at the counter, got our food number and found a seat while we waited. service was friendly and fast.  i ordered the B option, which is sausage on a fresh bun, it comes with 2 free toppings.  I got the Merguez which is supposed to be a Moroccan style sausage made of lamb and harissa (a north african spice) with sweet sauteed onion and jalapenos. it was really good - the lamb was juicy with lots of flavor. my friend got the italian sausage (pork and sicilian fennel) which was also really good. they've got a whole variety of sausages from chicken and turkey to venison and bison. sausages are $6 - $9 depending the meat.  the fries were meh, you can tell they fry them in stale oil because of the color - we opted for the plain fries instead of the duck fat fried fries or the dirty fries (which have a bunch of toppings on them).  overall it was a good experience, i would definitely go back again...very soon. if you love sausages and beer then knock yourself out at Wvrst!   around $10-15 per person including beverage.  must try: Merguez - cos LAMB rocks!"}
{"text":"So many meats! YUM. A large space with communal seating. Lots of beers on tap and in bottle. A bit of wine too. Duck Fat Fries...loaded. Need I say more?! Had a great meal here. Wild boar/mushroom/tea was excellent with Giardiniera on top. A good place to start or end a weekend night."}
{"text":"A nice walk to this place and a nice set of stairs leads to a nice open area.  The atmosphere is very relaxing and friendly.   A great place to have a beers with company.  People are super professional and friendly. The Food is amazing.  Loved the jalapeno toppings - nice and spicy.  The sausages are very tasty.  They recommended a nice Weihenstephaner - Oh totally hit the spot!  Duck fat fries is the best I ever had.. must try!  Will go back anytime - no doubt."}
{"text":"It was the best of times, it was the wurst of times... just kidding, only the best! Except that I found the exact same sausage combinations in the freezer at that huge natural food store on Augusta in Kensington. So sad cuz I thought they made them in house. Duck fries are boom diggity."}
{"text":"Heard about their sausages and had to try it! Ordering is a little different and the line up for your food gets pretty long....but it's worth the wait. Grab a good ol' fashioned German pint while you try to hold it with one hand and get in line. The sausage variety is pretty good ranging from your traditional sausage to a little more adventurous options like wild boar, bison and kangaroo just to name a few. We went here for a friends birthday and it was an awesome time! Reasonably priced an always has a nice buzz in the room. We tried the dirty fries as well and they were pretty good. Highly recommended for birthdays, nights out with friends, or even a date night option to start off the night! We'll be coming back for sure. Try to get there early in the night before you don't get a table."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of sausages. Homemade everything. Excellent beer selection. Friendly staff. Unpretentious and cool industrial vibe. It's like heaven for regular dudes."}
{"text":"This has been one of my bucket list restaurants. Worth the walk. Had Elk sausage and had to order a second. The beer selection is fantastic."}
{"text":"A bit intimidating at first with the communal seating and long lines, but it was well worth the visit! A long list of various sausages, delicious duck fat fries, an extensive beer list, friendly service, and relatively fast. We were worried about finding somewhere to sit but by the time we got to the front of the line there was space. I think they have the timing worked out to keep things moving while you don't feel rushed.  The ice cream dessert was also delicious, though it melted quickly due to the inadequate air conditioning."}
{"text":"k. Duck fat fries/ maple + rosemary dipping sauce/ kranjska sausage.  Stop making your life complicated and order this."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Wvrst Cuisine: Hot Dogs Location: King West Address: 609 King St W Price Range: $10~15  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 3 Service: 4 Ambiance: 4 Overall: 3.5  Extra information:  *Communal Tables *Exotic Meats *Vegetarian option Avail *Lots of beer option  Wvrst is pronounced Verst. Yea, I know, I was super confused too and refused to call it by name- insisted to say that hot dog place. Hot Dog place is def understatement when it comes to Wvrst, located on King St West next door to Lou Dawgs (need to visit) and Lee Restaurant (need to visit also) Wvrst is known to serve good beer and exotic sausages.  Wvrst has been on my list for awhile but it took me awhile to visit because noone wanted to visit this 'hotdog' restaurant with me, when they could grab hotdog for $3 infront of Sears at Dundas Square.  Once I walked in, girl working behind the counter greeted me and handed me the menu, explaining how you order at the front, pay and then take a seat where they will bring you food. I already knew how the system worked at the restaurant, but it was nice of her to explain.  I read on couple blogs how this place could get super crowded and noisy- but I wasn't worried because we were going on a Tuesday night. There was Leafs game on, so couple tables were a little loud getting caught up in the game but it wasn't too bad.  Inside the restaurant is quite dim, with lights hanging from the ceiling. With their communal wooden tables, long bar by one wall and seats by the window, I really liked the overall atmosphere of the restaurant. It was very laid back, yet not too casual with consistent theme throughout the restaurant.  Ordered: Bratwvrst on a toasted fresh bun 4/5  *Served on a buttery white roll with 2 toppings (Sweet sauteed Onions & Sweet Peppers) for $6 *This is made with Veal, Pork and Wine *Sausage is fresh (not those typical processed meat sausages from grocery stores) *Bun was just soft enough to wrap up the sausage but hard enough so that toppings didn't fall through *It was a good hot dog, but I didn't see anything special about it *There are 4 different types of sauce (ketchup, mustard, etc) that you can use on the table *I expected the sausage to be juicier but it was kind of dry *The Hot dogs are not very big and 1 will not fill you up if you have a big appetite!  Ordered: Duck sausage on a toasted fresh bun 2/5  *Served on a white roll with 2 toppings (Sweet sauteed Onions and Sauteed Jalepenos) for $9 *Made with Maple and Foie Gras *This was one of the popular picks amongst many reviews that I've read prior to the visit *The sausage is same size as the Bratwvrst *Very distinct smell to this sausage (you can def tell it's duck and there is foie gras in there) *Sausage is very soft and has buttery feel to it (like foie gras, or even mashed up liver) *Sauteed jalepenos helped to get rid of the strong scent *I usually love foie gras, but I didn't really enjoy this hot dog  Ordered: Duck Fat Fries 2/5  *Small french fries for $4.50 *We ordered small, but their fries are big in portion *Picked Wvrst Spicy dipping sauce (made in house), it's basically mayo with sriracha sauce *Simple flavors for the dipping sauce, but it was delicious *This duck fat fries are raved about left and right all over reviews online so I was excited to try them *They weren't served very hot which was surprising to me *The fries were def rich in flavor and had creaminess to it *They are soft french fries but I prefer crispy ones *Fries were decent with the sauce, but I didn't think they were anything special *I think St. Louis Wings, Big Smoke Burger or the Holy Chuck Burger has better french fries  I thought about trying one of their beers, but I wasn't really in the mood to drink. So I went with Aranchiata Orange (yum!) They have a small station next to where you make your order- to grab water or forks and knives.  Summary: This is always an issue when I read too many reviews or hear good things prior to the actual visit. I end up expecting way too much from the restaurant ( I do this to myself) and leave somewhat disappointed even when the food was actually alright. Personally, I don't think I would go back to Wvrst for their hotdogs- if I do go back, it would only be for beer/drinks."}
{"text":"Best beer selection in town hands down. Begin and end your night here.  Not only that Chef Aldo has the best duck fries and sausages in town. And so what if the music is loud. At least it's good!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and I would come back!  + Delicious food. A wide variety of sausages and beers available. All the sausages I have tried have been delicious + My favourite so far has been the specialty \"kaas\" sausage + Excellent staff, have has great experiences. They have been friendly and professional.  + Large fries are LARGE- almost too much so! Mmmmm. - Because of the \"cafe\" concept, which I do like, the lines can get very long  Note: Long lines outside on a Saturday! Worth the wait, but come with patience."}
{"text":"If you're craving some German cuisine from your homeland (or just in general), this is your spot. It's spacious with a biergarten vibe to it with big wooden tables. The currywurst I had was delicious and the sauce was great. Very friendly service, too!"}
{"text":"This is the like the Toronto equivalent of Rosemunde. HUGE selection of sausages and beer.  The sausage were pretty well priced but I felt that the beer was superiorly expensive.  I loved that they featured so many local beers. I had the duck fat fries with all the toppings- it was a little over the top but decent.  I got the calabrese sausage and it was delicious and I was glad I ventured outside of my normal italian.  I was surprised that on a Saturday night that a place like this was half empty. I couldn't tell if it was a Toronto thing, or if it was just an off night."}
{"text":"I'm a veggie, so I wish there were more options, but, for King West, I like the relaxed atmosphere and the drink. Great place to go with a group of friends."}
{"text":"We swung by after a day out on the town to get some food and drinks.  Walk in, up the stairs and be nice to the bouncer.  We walked in and found an empty spot for 10 people.  The tables are long communal tables.  You see this right away so if you're not in for sitting next to someone please turn around and leave instead of complaining about it later!  It's pretty damn obvious when you see the tables and layout.  We sat down and then decided to go get some food and drinks.  You have to walk up to 2 separate counters to get each of your food and drinks.  I ended up getting a calabrese and a wild boar.  The calabrese wasn't bad.  It had decent flavour but wasn't as spicy as I thought it was going to be.  The wild boar on the other hand was excellent!!!  The beer selection is pretty solid here as well.    The staff are friendly and very helpful.  If you want to a recommendation they can definitely help out.  The environment is very relaxed but at the same time you can and probably will be seated with others so it can get rowdy...just saying :)"}
{"text":"Went to this place right after Germany's victory in the World Cup final and the atmosphere was amazing! There were many people yelling \"DEUTSCHLAND, DEUTSCHLAND\" while sipping on beer and eating sausages. Tried the Flying Monkey IPA and it was great. Overall, great vibe."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant! It's communal tables make for a fun, interactive environment. The hot dogs are all awesome. They have a wide variety of meats including kangaroo, duck, chicken, beef, lamb, etc. which makes the dining experience really fun."}
{"text":"Wvrst is Wunderbar!  Located on the happening strip of King West - Wvrst offers a great selection of BEvERages and sausages!  I loved the fact they have veggie choices - I tried the Sweet Basil Vegan sausage and it was delicious.  For every sausage choice, you get to choose two toppings.  Bread is optional as well.  You do also have interesting meat selection from Rabbit to Bison to Kangaroo, plus more.  Their fries are very addictive and you get a choice of dipping sauce with your order.  You might want to get a couple of different sauces for the full french fries experience.  I highly recommend this place for a quick lunch/dinner or even to meet up just for drinks.  They are open late for clubbing/lounge nights."}
{"text":"It's unique from any restaurant (or bar) I've visited in the past. The seating indoors consists of a few tables to the sides, with a few large benches down the middle. This sort of setting really encourages socialization, which is great.   Wvrst is known best for their sausages. They have typical sausage items such as pork, turkey, and chicken. But then they also have more exotic items, including kangaroo, bison, and elk. I tried the kangaroo sausage, and it was fantastic. They're also known for their duck fat fries. I can't really explain how those taste; I've never had anything like it, but they're really good, and a large order works as an appetizer for two people.  They have a decent variety of craft beer, and on Mondays it's $5/pint. All in all, definitely give this place a shot if you're looking for a unique experience."}
{"text":"Their duck fat fries are amazing. Their mediterranean sausage is pretty yummy too, though it's on the dry side. I'm not sure if I'd recommend this place to vegetarians but if you come, try the fries and get them with the creamy garlic dip.  Good prices, cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great beer. Great sausage. Fast and friendly service. Perfect place to go for a quick and satisfying bite. Best part, this joint is close to many other wonderful establishments that it's easy to go on a pub crawl / walking tour on a nice day."}
{"text":"Duck fat fries, duck fat fries, and more duck fat fries please! My personal favourite sausage is the the duck and Foie sausage. But you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu here! Also, if you have room after the sausage, fries, and pints of beer - their soft serve ice cream is a must try!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. This place is an open concept cafeteria style hipster joint.   You walk in and you see lots of long benches for seating. It's open seating so you do not get seated. You seat yourself. On the left side of the place is the bar with a large selection of craft beers. Probably 20 beers on tap and 80+ in bottles available.   On the left side of the place is the food ordering location. They specialize in Wvrst, hence the name. I must say the Duck Foie Gras sausage is by far my most favourite sausage. You get to pick 2 toppings such as Sauerkraut, sweet onions etc. And whether you want it on a bun or not. Their duck fries are also very amazing. No one can argue fries fried in duck fat. When ordering is done they give you a number sign to bring to your table and they bring the food to you.  On weekends there is quite a line to get in but it's not very long at all as this place is more of an in and out place to eat. It is located on King West so be weary about the parking and busyness of the clubs and bars surrounding it.  My suggestion is to hit up Lee's restaurant next door for a nice dinner then go for a post dinner drink and late night snack at Wvrst.  if you are ever not happy then you can go across the street to the Bier Market.  Highly recommended and definitely worth the trip to this place. Too bad they don't have their sausages available to buy at grocery stores. I'd be all over that."}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere, the restaurant is set up like a German beer hall with long picnic tables. The food is relatively hearty pub grub (primarily sausages) with a solid set of gluten free options. The list of beers on tap is pretty varied and includes a variety of craft brews. I would recommend it for casual get togethers with friends more focused on drinks than a fancy dinner."}
{"text":"We held our engagement party over the weekend and I couldn't say enough amazing things! We had a reservations for 50 people with an open bar and snacks. The whole evening went off without a hitch, from the managers to the bartenders to servers everyone was so accommodating and it was the perfect space for our event! I would HIGHLY recommend smaller events or even just a night out! Love WVRST!"}
{"text":"This isn't your ordinary beer hall, it's even better. The decor of this restaurant is very modern and minimalist. The entire setup is very social with long tables meant for the guests to intermingle. The beer and cider selection is incredibly extensive with 30 or so on tap plus an entire book of bottles. The really unique thing about this place though is the house made sausages. Ranging from kangaroo to pheasant and anywhere in between the customization here can lead you to multitudes of delicious concoctions."}
{"text":"WVRST sausage in Toronto - I mean that in the best possible way.  WVRST serves up a fresh take on the old beer hall. Shared tables, friendly staff, great music, cleanliness, supreme sausages and a terrific beer selection are their hallmarks.  Low points?  Sure they got em: VERY w...e...a...k wifi and duck fat fries that are, well, meh.  Hey look, you can't have it all but you can have the Oktoberfest pork/beef/sage sausage with sauerkraut (wine barrel fermented) and sweet peppers like I did, wash it down with any of their dozens of beer choices and have a great time.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. the sausages are tastey and have turkey/chicken version as well as more gamey meats. the dirty duck fries single order is amazing!!! the one in a platter is a bit different.   they also have some great bears on tap including a nice cider.   its a great place for a big group as well.   the services is very good!!"}
{"text":"Specialty: Hot dogs (traditional flavours, game meat, fusion flavours), duck fat fries, house-made pretzels, and a full wall of beer taps serving brews from all over the world  Restaurant style: Long benches, order at the counter, food delivered to your table.  I love the menu concept of listing all the flavourings and ingredients in all the sausages. There are so much to choose from. We shared the barese heritage platter with 4 ppl, along with side orders of duck fries, kimchi and pretzels.  The wursts are quite a bit different from what I expected. They are narrower in diameter, and quite oily from appearance. I love that there are different mustards on the table to go along with the wursts. The pretzels and duck fat fries were delicious - wish we ordered more. I was a bit surprised that the side dishes stood out more than the sausages themselves, but I could be wrong.  Suggestion: Have a tasting menu where customers can choose different flavoured sausages in smaller sizes. I would have tried the game meats, but again, I was hesitant that I might not like it. A sample / tasting menu could easily solve that.   Sidenote: Beer list is extensive! And some extremely pricey."}
{"text":"Lots of choices here for sausages and beer ! No joke, you could get lost on the beer menu.  I met up with a friend here last summer and it was an excellent time.  It was quite busy when I went but the open-style seating makes it easy to still have a comfortable meal and conversation but as people have said you'll likely be sitting next to a stranger when it gets crowded. Makes for a fun night out though !  Super friendly staff, very trendy restaurant, would definitely go again."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  The variety of sausages, the tasty side dishes, even the presentation is unique.  This was our favorite part of our Toronto trip, and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight, and it was just okay.   Love the set up and atmosphere of this place!   I went here super excited for my wiener and I wasn't disappointed but I wasn't that impressed either. I got the Bratwvrst sausage which is veal, pork and mustard seed. I topped it off with onions and sweet peppers. The toppings were delish but didn't taste the veal or mustard seed in my sausage. Also got the Dirty Fries which is fries topped with jalapeños, onions, peppers and Wvrst sauce. The Wvrst sauce is a curry sauce and might not be for everyone.  I for one don't mind curry but don't know if I like it on my fries. Added the chive and roasted garlic mayonnaise dipping sauce which was very delicious and tasty.   Overall This place wasn't bad and I'll give it another shot, but don't think I'll be craving it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Toronto. Great beer, awesome food, and a fun place to hang out. We've been three or four times and always sit at the bar. We've never had to wait in line either (get there before 6). We always get a sausage and duck fat fries. I've had a few different sausages, and they're all great, but kranjska might be my favorite. The duck fat fries--OMG so good. Love the dipping sauces too."}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection and the best ambiance of any the places Ive visited in Toronto  Food is amazing , bison sausage is my favourite , so different"}
{"text":"I tried a normal, Krajanska (garlic sausage) hotdog and wasn't blown away. No real flavour in the meat, and the sauerkraut added nothing, not to mention the slimy sauteed onions that would have been better as a raw garnish.  I will try again this time, a gamier hotdog and update this review, but so far I wouldn't travel back to eat here tomorrow, which is why I'm only giving it 3 stars for now."}
{"text":"I was happily surprised to see that they served the wurst with currywurst  ( german sauce similar to ketchup).  Atmosphere is pretty cool with long tables that groups can sit on.  I would say this was a gastropub with a minimal menu and a lot of beer."}
{"text":"Way too many things to try! All kinds of sausages, pickled things, and dipping sauces! We tried the Oktoberfest one and it was so good. Don't forget your side order of Dirty Duck Fries.   Customer service was great! The guy patiently and politely explained the ordering processes and I even noticed how he went out of his way to help a couple order who spoke limited English. He found a way to get through to them and they looked like happy camper."}
{"text":"As a vegan heading to lunch at a \"sausage hall\", I did NOT have high hopes. But surprise, surprise, Wvrst has a house-made, vegan and gluten free sausage!!  The vegetarian Dirty Fries are also gluten free, so I ate like a Queen!  We went during off hours on a Sunday afternoon for my nephew's 5th birthday, and we had a nice, big table to ourselves in the corner. Staff were friendly and knowledgable, and no-one blinked at my nephew, who wore his Storm Trooper mask for most of the meal.  It's actually a surprisingly kid friendly place.   Props to these guys for having really tasty options for vegans!!"}
{"text":"The decor was fun and the staff so welcoming and helpful! I trekked out to this restaurant on my own and had a lovely time sitting by the window people watching.   The duck fat fries and beer (sorry, I forget the name) were really great, and I had the Duck and Merguez (Lamb) Sausages (YEAH I KNOW THAT'S A LOT OF FOOD FOR ONE PERSON BUT #YOLO OKAY?!). I thought maybe the fries outshone the the sausages, which was a shame bc I was really anticipating the sausages to be really amazing. I still enjoyed them, but they didn't really wow me- I am definitely a fan of gamey-ness in meats, and I think this place seems good for people who are not really into that. For me personally, if I eat something fancy like a duck/foie gras sausage, I just expect it to taste really ducky/foie-y, otherwise what's the point?   That said, again, I didn't NOT enjoy my time here. Not the super bestest for the gamey meats, but also not the WVRST... lol ba dum bum chh."}
{"text":"If you like sausage and beer, this is your place. I wish they had one in NYC. This place is great for groups but does get a little noisy."}
{"text":"My husband is German and Currywurst is one of the things that he really misses. We heard that there is a place that serves Currywurst for quite sometimes and finally we had a chance yesterday(Saturday night) to go and try it.  There are a lot of different kinds of beer and drinks to choose from, it's a great place to drink if you like loud noise, I mean the noise level was 10+, you can barely hear anything, all I heard was people yelling at each other, but mind you it was a full house last night.  The food were very disappointing, the sauce for currywurst tasted different than the ones we had in Germany, I can taste the tomato sauce but not enough curry. The Oktoberfest and bratwurst were ok but I have had better in Kitchener, the country bread was hard, the most disappointed of all was the duck fat fries, it's was beyond over cooked, it seem like it's been triple fried."}
{"text":"So I finally made it out to Wvurst and I absolutely loved it! It was totally unexpected but I'm glad I went for a friend's day party.  Thank goodness they had made reservations as it was a full house! There are bouncers right at the door asking if you have reservations or not. Strict! Our friends were seated right by the windows overlooking King Street, and I prefer those tables (slightly raised) to the long, communal tables in the middle of the room. Our area afforded us more privacy and it was just us.  My bf and I had the Vegetarian Sausage (he had given up meat for Lent) and it was disgusting. I had vegetarian meals before, so I'm not saying because it was vegetarian it was bad, but this grainy, flimsy and bland piece of something smothered in a weird sauce was not what I was expecting. The vegetarian fries where somewhat better...fries are fries so it's the sauce that makes all the difference. Veg fries come with something like a sweet and sour pepper sauce that doesn't do justice at all.  Let's face it...this is a MEAT place! I saw all my other friends devouring their sasuges in no time.   Beers are nothing special, and I actually prefer the beer selection from the Bier Market. I had some Flying Monkey drink that was very hoppy and another light German brand which escapes me at the moment. They also have shots, but the selection is either limited to Jaggers (spelling?) or Bourbon so...  I highly recommend this place for a group gathering...it's fun, jovial and lively. I would also highly recommend RESERVATIONS! I actually liked how they bouncers kept people outside (so maximum number of people retained inside) as this makes the place not crowded and like a club with bumper to bumper elbows. Totally loving this place!"}
{"text":"Overall rating 3.5 stars.   Really cool ambiance with communal seating and casual style service. Definitely worth checking out for the experience, however I wasn't particularly blown away by the food, and that's a little disappointing considering I do love sausages!   Just a heads up - Wvrst ONLY has sausages and fries.   We all ordered our sausages in a bun. They've got GREAT fresh buns!  Oktoberfest - nothing special Duck foie gras - tasty but nothing spectacular, lacks that nice chewy bite you look for in sausage texture  Kangaroo - had to try this unique offering. It was a very lean meat for a sausage, and therefore not as juicy, and texture more chewy than an average sausage. Seasoning was subtle and the meat's flavour came through a little gamey.  It wasn't bad but I wouldn't order it again.  Wild boar and mushroom - hands down the best sausage. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Super flavourful and juicy.   AMAZING fries with the dips they have available. However, I do NOT recommend the dirty fries. They're smothered in A LOT of sweet sauce. They have way too much flavour and fries were way too soggy because of the sauce. If sweet and soggy is your flavour, then by all means!   Wvrst also has an enormous selection of beers and an interest offering of ice-cream for dessert with duck fat bits that I did not get to try.   Overall, although a very hip and happening spot to be in, however sausages alone were not mind blowing enough to have me looking forward to another visit."}
{"text":"Fell in love. Different kinds of sausage and flavors as well as the traditional flavors. Great beer list and great vibes."}
{"text":"We've been to Otto's Bierhalle and really enjoyed the food, and so decided to come to WVRST to try their famous sausages. My sister ordered the bratwurst with the toasted white bun (hot dog style) topped with jalapeños and cold sauerkraut. Meanwhile, I got the elk sausage with sauerkraut and sweet peppers.  The bratwurst tasted good, and was loaded with toppings. However, my sister's comment was that the toppings overpowered the taste of the sausage - in particular, the jalapeños were super spicy. Be forewarned: it can get really messy trying to eat this hot dog with all its toppings (my sister really struggled).  I really did enjoy my elk, and found it to be very rich and smoky in flavour. It was on the salty side, but went really well with the sweet peppers, ketchup, and Dijon mustard with whole mustard seeds. That said, the meat was extremely crumbly and fell out of the casing very easily, making it likewise difficult to cut / eat.  That said, I really did find the sausages to be overpriced and not worth the associated $10 tag. If I really want sausages next time, I may just go to Otto's Bierhalle and get the large platters."}
{"text":"Ambience: 3/5 Food: 4/5 Service: 3/5 (Friendly) Value: 3/5  Repeat: Already have. Sausage fest!"}
{"text":"I got the elk sausage currywvrst style and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND trying it! The curry sauce is sooooo good. The elk sausage is so flavourful. My friend got the kangaroo sausage and it was also really tasty. We couldn't really tell the difference between the meats though. I also recommend trying them with the mustard seed dijon if you like a lil spice. I also appreciate how they have half pints here, the pilsner is pretty good if you're looking for a lighter beer."}
{"text":"The Kranjska on a bun with cheese and onions was amazing, as was the bratwurst currywurst.  Usually a bit of a line and it's a pretty rowdy place, but definitely worth going to if you like/love sausage."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. A month ago, my husband was waiting for me and was already seated in the restaurant for a table for 2. I was on my way still. Finally when I got there, the hostess and the owner of the restaurant would not let me in because they were at capacity. I told them how my husband was already in the restaurant and they still wouldn't let me in. I tried calling my husband at the door to come and meet me and they still wanted me to leave and started to block me from even SEEING him! I just wanted to know where my husband was so I can show that he was there. He came running out to meet me and the hostess and owner both started yelling at us that they won't let me in because they were at capacity! I just don't understand how they could be at capacity when they gave us a table. I left so frustrated and feeling incredibly disrespected. Disappointed in how the owner especially dealt with the situation. Completely unprofessional. I expect and demand an apology at some point."}
{"text":"Unique sausage place with great beer selections in a Bavarian style dining atmosphere.  Lots of choices of sausage and toppings. A definite to check out. Casual and fun"}
{"text":"So wanted to update my review, this has become more and more of an after work drinks/food place. It used to be places in Liberty Village but I just can not stand the crowd there any longer.   It is a very communal kind of place but you can call ahead and reserve so we do that more often than not at the staff have always been fantastic. I mean like super awesome guys that work here.   Food - originally i used to be go for their sausages in a bun in my feeble attempts to cut down the carbs i settle for the currywrvst option which I love. That combined with the duck far fries and a dipping sauce is spot on. They have a great selection of meats but I am still kind of basic so always opt for the pork or chilli chiken. I have tried the boar and elk i think it was and they are all as good as the one before.  Drinks - being a big fan of wheat beer I am the idiot ordering waanstappehereorhehreorher, because i struggle even now to say it right but a quick google tells me it is Weihestephaner.  When we have not reserved a space this place can get busy and the main block of communal tables get taken up very quickly."}
{"text":"Service was good. (Unless you want water). Music is chill, and Duck fat is 10/10. Order the duck fat fries. Order the duck fat fries. Order the duck fat fries. Order the duck fat fries. Order the duck fat fries. Order the duck fat fries. Order the duck fat fries. Order the duck fat fries. Order the duck fat fries!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night around 12 am and This place was packed.   Sausages were very good but service was slow and employees were very rude"}
{"text":"Been hearing about this place for a long time so today after work, I decided today is my \"cheat\" day... I didn't mean it to be but who am I kidding when there's an item called dirty fries on the menu? Those can't be good for you... Maybe for the soul but certainly not the heart...   I got the pork and chili paste sausage currywvrst style. It was good, the meat was not overcooked and the flavors complimented each other.  Dave got the kangaroo sausage on a bun. It was good, but I found it a little dry. I'm not one for condiments as I they hide the flavor of food rather than enhance it. So when he had to reach for the mustard and ketchup, I felt disappointed.   We got a large dirty duck fat fries. Fries were thick and crispy, with grilled jalenpenos and peppers and the currywverst sauce. Delicious.  The bill was pricey for some sausages $40. For that I probably won't be a regular but I did enjoy it the food."}
{"text":"Massive selection, holy delicious! Definitely gets busy but it's a cool vibe and seems to bring out the best in people based on my experience here. The beer isn't exactly cheap but it's a big beer menu and there's some exotic brews to try here if you're even in the mood for a $40 pint. Or stick to the $7 varieties. Major props for a selection of vegetarian sausages as well (there are 4!)"}
{"text":"Came to try this place out w my family. There were a lot of meats to choose from. We had the rabbit, kangaroo, wrst and this other one wrapped in bacon. It was nice and juicy. We also got the duck fries. I didn't like that one too much. It felt too dried out for my taste. This places looks good to hang out with friends and colleagues for a drink."}
{"text":"When you first walk in, it smells kinda gross. The atmosphere is pretty fun and the service is good but the sausages are so greasy and pretty bland."}
{"text":"Wvrst is a seriously cool place! If you're craving sausage, and a chill vibe this is the place to be.  The greeter at the door ran us through the menu, and how the restaurant works. It's an open floor plan, and inspired by German biergartens in terms of seating, and ordering food. Their bar also has a variety of different beers on tap.  Their menu is pretty wicked and truly different than anything I have ever seen in terms of sausage flavours. I had the black bean sausage which was flavourful and spicy, and my friend had the lamb sausage which was very juicy. The fries were great, and you won't be disappointed by the variety of homemade dipping sauces!   I hope to come back again with a group of friends. It's a great place to sit down, socialize, and enjoy a delicious sausage and fries. With many people mostly in their 20's sitting in one large space, it almost reminded me of hostel life (which isn't a bad thing).  Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and amazing food!"}
{"text":"WRVST is more of a cool place to hang with your buddies after work than it is a cool place to eat sausages.   It's a bit pricey for a hot dog that doesn't taste as good as a DIY hot dog 3.50 down king street stand. I understand you are paying for a \"game\" meat and LUXURY sausage but an upscale sausage is like an upscale dollarama. Lel.   Come for the beer flights and the sausages when you guys want a COOL ambience with dim lights and loud beer hall type vibes. I had a spicy Italian and Oktoberfest sausage. Both were very good but the jalapeños burned my mouth so I had to apply ice to it after."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this review for a little over a week now. A recent gathering of yelpers brought me down from my hallowed perch way up in the snowy mountaintops of the GTA. A Banger in the mouth you say? That sounds like an offer I couldn't possibly pass up.   I'd never been to Wvrst before so I was more than a little excited to try the famed sausage and see the belly of this German style Brat-house. The interior is set up like an Oktoberfest Hall. Long communal bench like tables (made with real wood) line the dining area, with several more private booths along the perimeter. The lighting is dim but I imagine during the day the large windows out front let in a healthy amount of light.  On to the menu, I had a difficult time deciding on what I wanted to eat as I stood at the counter trying to decide. I saw several options that I will be back for in future 100% but I decided on the Maple and Blueberry infused Bison sausage to which I added grilled sweet peppers and sauerkraut. On its own without any other toppings this sausage and bun combo (I went meat on bun but the other option is to have your sausage served curry style) was to die for.  Not to be left out I was coerced into purchasing an order of their duck fat fries. I mean after reading all the reviews about them I would silly to not at least try them once. Verdict.... GREAT SUCCESS!!! Unlike any other french fry I had ever eaten before, this tater could stand proudly on its own without the aid of salt or sauce and tasted delicious all on its own. Also the duck fat makes for a much crispier fry and they crispyness is outstanding when you pair it with one of their in house specialty sauces. I had one with rosemary which was OK but the Chipotle was unreal.   While their I also partook in a couple of their craft beers on tap. I am kicking myself for not writing down their names but I know one was a pilsner and the other a much darker smoother (similar to Leffe) brew. Both were delectable.  Some reviews made me anticipate the Wvrst BUT all I got was Wvry BEST!"}
{"text":"Decided to come here for lunch with a friend last week to try the duck fat fries and some of their sausages (no homo). Overall the food was pretty good, the staff were charming and helpful with educating us on the logistics of ordering and provided good recommendations on drinks. Good experience overall.  Food (4/5) Duck fat fries Kangaroo Bison Venison  Service (4/5) Price (4/5) Ambiance (4/5)"}
{"text":"Went to try the Vegan special sausage sandwhich. Love the vibe and very friendly staff here. It is indeed a very cool and interesting place to dine in with a few friends.  Loved it and will definetly visit again."}
{"text":"Venison sausage was alright. The chicken sausage with curry was good too, with the right amount if spice. I didn't like the fries though, they were soggy and nothing special :/  The downside is that it gets really busy on weekends and evenings, and the noise level is out the roof. They do a lot of private events on one section of the floor (like networking meetups sometimes) so it gets really loud, and service can be really REALLY slow (almost non existent, you have to chase down the bar tender or a waiter)  Overall 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"First time at Wvrst was pretty overwhelming as it is just a open space where you have to seat yourself without any service. Place was extremely loud as well.  Worst part is that if you come late without your party you have to wait in line with all the others people outside even if your friend has a table for you.   Lots of choice of sausage to pick from (can get in bun or platter style) Ordered the duck it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Great variety of meat but I didn't like the texture. Duck fat fries are delicious and a must try!"}
{"text":"Wvrst est un bar dans le type cantine allemande, j'entends longues tablées avec banc en bois et bière servies dans des pintes de 1L. ( bien sûr les formats pint et half a pint sont dispo). Le concept est simple, commandez le type de viande que vous voulez ça va du porc au kangourou, le type d'accompagnement de votre hot dog ainsi que le type de pain et on vous donnera un panneau avec un numéro que vous laisserez en évidence sur votre table afin que le staff vienne vous déposer votre commande. Je recommande la saucisse de Francfort accompagné de choucroute et d'une blonde légère. C'est l'un des mes endroits préférés à Toronto !"}
{"text":"Wvrst is the best!!!! Some of the best wvrst you will find outside of Germany, this place is dishing out some quality meats!!!   We were sat pretty immediately as they have long community tables making it a fun casual joint. Once settled in we walked up to the counter to order our meals. I had the kangaroo wvrst with sweet onions and sweet peppers and it was phenomenal! I've never had roo before so I can't compare it to anything but the meat was tender and not gamey at all which I liked. It was seasoned with some great herbs and it was served on a fresh bun. I also had a currywurst style brat which I've only ever found as street food in Germany and it was on point!!  You also have to get the duck fat fries and pick one of the amazing dipping sauces. I had the chili tomoato jam and I loved it. Sweet with a kick. They have a ridiculous selection of drinks on tap in bottles and more!  Come here for a fun and amazing time!"}
{"text":"Went out to Wvrst this past weekend for the epic birthday celebration of one Taylor O (see his review below).  I need to start by saying that I've walked past Wvrst a many times wondering \"what is this mysterious looking joint that just popped up on King West\" ?!?!  The more I walked by, the more intrigued I became.  Well, my long lasting quest to conquer Wvrst became a reality on Saturday as I was walking down King Street craving some fantastic sausage [put in joke here].  ssccccrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeccccccccchhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!  But wait, what do you mean you've reached capacity by 9:30 pm !?! How is that even possible ?!?  Luckily for me (and after flashing a big Amit smile), I was not one of those people that had to wish Taylor a happy bday over the phone.  I got in the place was rocking.  Louder than a restaurant should be, but still rockin.  I bee-lined to the counter and got myself a double serving of Italian Currywurst and then picked up a 1L serving of King beer.  If you ever need to re-find that feeling of being a MAN, then come here to experience drinking beer out of a 1L mug.  Nothing. Compares.  You know what else doesn't compare?  Having to wait 30 minutes for a chef to cook and chop up a sausage.  I could have ate 15 street sausages in that same amount of time.  I'm just saying.  Although the wait was terrible, I can't say anything terrible about the food - the sausage in the curry was fantastic and my new favorite way to eat a piece of meat.  Is it worth the $6/sausage?  Maybe not, but the experience of eating great meat while chugging out of a man mug makes it all worth it at the end of the day.  I'll definitely come back... but probably on a weekday when it's quieter with shorter lineups!"}
{"text":"What is there to not like about this place? Great and helpful staff, a huge selection of delicious sausages, a really nice beer list, and duck fat fries. I wish I had room to try the pickles too, but now I guess I have something more to try next time."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Such a good selection of sausage and beer! Been her many times and often take people from out of town and they love it. I personally like the chorizo and if you get fries you need to get the duck fat ones! the dirty fries are also good with a really nice sauce on them. Lots of table space and you may end up having to share which is part of the experience. Highly recommend. If you are adventurous they also have a lot of game meat sausages."}
{"text":"great beer hall feel. Nice selection of craft beers including one that had a smokey whiskey flavor, interesting but not my speed. We had 3 different game sausages all which were good...mind you I'm a big fan of any encased meats."}
{"text":"Would definitely come back, yummy!  Came here for Sunday lunch with wife & son, and it was very enjoyable.  For those with strollers, note the challenge of lugging it up stairs.  Duck fat fries - I've had a lot of duck fat fries in my day, but this is the first one where I've actually tasted the duck fat.  Couple that with the sauces (we had the truffle one, and the chive one), and it's fat & creamy heaven!  Sausages were cooked perfectly, with a nice blend of tenderness, temperature, and doneness.  We had the wild boar, and the oktoberfest.  We had one that was currywurst style, meaning it came with a mild Indian sauce (delicious).  Top that off with a couple of half pints from a wide selection of taps, and we had it made.  Great for our son that they had a high chair, wide open space, and wasn't crazy packed/loud.  Service - It's a counter, but I thought it was great.  They came by and asked how things were, the bartender was helpful and allowed for a beer sample before confirming the order, and the recommendations by staff on what to order... Exceeded expectations.  Thanks Wvrst, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"The selection of game meat is pretty awesome.  Guinea fowl, pheasant, kangaroo, wild boar, elk, venison, and a few others that slip my mind at the moment.  If you keep the sausage plain enough, you might get the true taste since they're sausages are all mixed with other items.  Needless to say, they're all very tasty.   A must try is the dirty fries and the maple dip.  Well... all of their dips are amazing...  This place deserves at least a few visits!   And when you order, just pick a spot at the community style tables and have your food brought to you.  Very easy setup.   When picking a pint, the bar is nice enough to give you a taste of whatever is on tap.  Pretty nice to help decide between the different beers that they seem to continuously rotate.   Oh! Jager on tap?  Hella expensive!  Paid 15 for a double.  Nothing special.  I don't recommend getting it."}
{"text":"This place is great if you love sausages and beer, and just wanna chill out with your friends. It has cute lights hanging from the ceiling, there's basically picnic tables for people to sit at. I really liked the KAAS sausage that I got and really enjoyed my cider flight. Tbh, I wasn't the biggest fan of the duck fat fries or the pretzels. Either way, will definitely come back here to hang out with some friends, and also a good place to grab a few drinks before heading out for the night."}
{"text":"When you feel like eating big game meat, this is the place.  Just above Forno Cultura, another place you should try, Wvrst is the place for sausage and beer. The big game selection is what got my attention. It's the perfect place for some get together with the open space.   You first order your meat, the big game selection is really fascinating from elk, bison to the unknown meat to us all, kangaroo meat. It's not as bad as it sounds and the sausage pretty much taste interesting in its own way. For those who are not into those wild challenges, there are regular sausage or vegan. Duck fat fries is also something quite interesting. Beer taps are attached to the wall so you get to see beerfall.   Overall the place is a great place for after work get together with some sausage and beer."}
{"text":"I do not like this place. It's always noisy and crowded. It's basically a fancy food court - you line up for food, you line up for beer, and there are communal picnic tables. I don't mind communal eating but it's awkward to get in/out of the picnic tables when you're packed e;bow to elbow. The sausages are okay but nothing special."}
{"text":"- not sure about this place just yet - having just opened on thursday, they've got a long way to go to build up the hype, and get butts in the door - went on friday night with a couple of friends around 8ish, to a pretty empty establishment. that feeling of being in an empty restaurant is not so cool. but maybe it gets busier past 10:30 (which is when we left) - it's definitely hipster-friendly, and am not sure who they are catering for as the tunes playing were really random.  - from a food point of view, sausages are dynamite.  - totally recommend the bison blueberry.  - they also serve duck fat fries, which is a nice step up from your regular spuds. - i just wish that they had an option on their menu if you just want sausage and kraut as they only carry some type of curry wurst, or sausage in a bun.  - also, from a sharing standpoint, wvrst, if you're listening, you need to add sharing plate or something on your menu.  - for service, it's a little different, where they're trying to go with beerhall style where you order at a counter, get a number, and then the bring you the food. i liked it, but my dining companions didn't see that as being a nice touch.  2.5 STARS"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The meat is extremely fresh and juicy - definitely the right way to enjoy a good sausage.  The atmosphere is very casual, and very hipster - you'll be hard pressed to find a server without a beard.  A wide selection of craft beer on tap, and $5 a beer on Mondays!  An overall great experience."}
{"text":"For the most part, this is simply a beer/cider, sausage, and fries joint. But if you love all three of these things, like me, this place is truly great. They have a huge selection of sausage types and their fries are so so good, not to mention all of the dipping sauce options. Something also has to be said for the atmosphere of this place, it's the best of both worlds. It's situated in a very trendy nightlife area, being frequented by the nighttime crowd, but it's also home to a very welcoming everyday sort of crowd as well. The seating here is also family style, so you're bound to meet someone new every time you go. Win win."}
{"text":"We came here after the previous attempt at loading up on oysters went nowhere. The setup is striking as one feels like having walked in a fancy food court or a communal dining. Nice open and inviting open space for a casual dining spot.  Initially the impression was good as I was excited by the beer selection they had. The drafts are priced OK but the bottled stuff was marked up ridiculously (some cases 2X! for a bottled beer) I went for the DIEU DU CIEL and for the main I ordered duck with foie gras sausage topped with caramelized onions and peppers. Trying to be safe I ordered a side of duck fat fries. After that I was handed a number and told that I will be served shortly. I waited patiently for my order and saw the place get busy fast. The beer for our group was brought promptly. The main attraction took its time. I was first taken aback by the serving size a tiny sausage served on a toasted bun. The first bite didn't yield much results as it could have might as well have been chicken. Just went downhill after that. For a place that is known for the sausages they need improve quite a bit.  Duck fries were decent and were a hit with the group. Nice layering of taste.  With a good beer selection I would come here for fries and brew.  2.5 stars."}
{"text":"What's not to like about this place?  Sausage? Good. Beer? Good. Duck fat fries? GOOD.  A plethora of options to choose from when it comes to sausages, and what seems like just as much beer options. It's all communal seating and it can be difficult to find a spot (came here on a Sunday night at 8pm and it was packed). But the service is friendly and the food is spot on. The environment really can't be beat either, great place to be with friends and just enjoy the night.  I had the rabbit sausage with a little bit of sauerkraut on top. It hit the spot and was really tasty. Went well with the WVRST Communal C4 beer, which was very good. Shared some duck fat fries with friends and was impressed. Not the cheapest meal and not the most filling, but you can always order more food if you need."}
{"text":"When I had eaten at Wvrst there were no veggie options so I settled for the fries only to learn they are cooked in duck fat. Not the best place for me but it was for a birthday party so I decided to check out the other pros and cons.   My meat eating companions explained to me that the sausages were very average but enjoyed the fries.  The place was packed and super loud! At the end of the day it was too expensive and too little to be impressed about.   I didn't really experience the service as I didn't order the food but I believe it was a cafeteria style order system where u order at the back and they bring out the food to you wherever you are sitting.   My summary: meh!"}
{"text":"This place is all about the beer and not the food. I should have leant my lesson when reading reviews. If every other review talks about the booze, you know you are in trouble when it comes to the food. I went for the food and that was a mistake, I'm not a drinker. My friend Stanley mentioned this place to me and it sounded fun so I went and it was fun. I should have known better, Stanley and I rarely agree when it comes to food. I paid $15 for a sausage on a bun, no garnish, fries or drink, a bit over valued in in my opinion.  I guess if you have enough beer you won't realize you are paying $15 for a sausage on a bun. I guess you are also buying into the concept (make sure you like noisy) and not just the food. I just recently put similar lighting in my back garden so I can't help but think the décor is flawless :)  I was offered cheese on my sausage which I thought was a good idea seeing as I am cheat day anyway, turned out to be a mistake. I assumed it would be cheddar,  no one said it was going to be a stinky smelly cheese. I ordered the Mexican sausage, and with rhe exception of too much bun it was \"ok\".  Overall not too spicy, the right amount of condements and excelent service. The decor was festive, designed with a party in mind. I think the best part of this place was the Itialian bakery just below. Not a part of this place but wow, don't miss it. Wyrst is a bit loud but acceptable. I wouldn't run back but if a friend wanted to go, I would go back. But we would head downstairs for desert."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS GREAT!  Food: Variety galore! Veggie/vegan friendly, gluten free friendly, carnivore friendly sausages and sides.  Drink: Lots of interesting craft beers and even gluten free beer.  Service: Been here twice, each time I went, every staff member I encountered at the order window, bar, and servers were friendly.   Ambiance: Relaxed, open, great for groups, not too dark or bright, awesome furniture and overhead lighting.   For the vegetarians out there, I'd recommend a vegan tofu sausage and vegetarian dirty fries (:"}
{"text":"Update - still delicious. Not impressed by the soft serve (had the maple flavor) - it was quite meh."}
{"text":"If I could, I would give this place 0 stars. Wvrst is the worst. Apparently, if you arrive separate from your husband, you have to wait in line for 30 minutes in order to join him and his 6 friends. Guess business is so good here you would rather your patrons leave than expand."}
{"text":"Came here after work for some drinks and grub. My friends and I heard great things about this place so we decided to stop in. Definitely a good stomping ground.  Like a classic Oktoberfest Hall, there are long bench tables that can sit several people. You go up to the bar to order your food and drinks. The process is simple and quick:   Pick your meat (game, traditional, heritage breed), pick your toppings, pick your fries (and option is cooked in duck fat, holy heck! You will hate yourself for ordering it, but it's worse if you don't - trust me) and pick your dipping sauce. I chose the kangaroo sausage on a toasted bun with onions and sauerkraut, ordered the duck fat fries and chose the WVRST sauce (kind of like a spicy mayo). The sausage was okay, my bun was kind of soggy by time it arrived, but the fries were amazing.   They have a large selection of craft brew beers and on Mondays they have a $5 special. Definitely worth a stop, this place looks especially popular with the after work crowd. Stop by!"}
{"text":"Tried the Kangaroo sausage. Pretty good, with a side of duck fries. Pretty pricey place for a sausage and beer 30$  Kind of confusing beer menu, but cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent variety of craft / international beers, large beer steins, delicious sausages and amazing fries / dipping sauces. Too bad I had to wait in line for more than 45 minutes to get in.   In fairness, I arrived on a Saturday night at 8pm but I think a 45 minute wait is a bit much for sausages and beer. When I left just after 10pm, the lines were gone. Note to self - return later in the evening when I need a sausage fix. The restaurant does not really get overcrowded, the doorman indicated the problem is headcount and the max people allowed under the fire code.  The sausages are delicious and very filling. I tried the Bratwurst, Italian and Calabrese. All were excellent. I recommend getting everything on them - the combination of sauerkraut, jalapeños, Sauteed onions and sweet peppers. You get two free toppings and pay 25 cents for additional toppings  They have a broad variety of sausages including 4 vegetarian, 3 chicken / turkey selections and 9 \"game\" varieties (i.e. rabbit, kangaroo, duck and wild boar). I will experiment a little more on my next visit.  The fires are really good, some of the best. I had the duck fat fries and they were cooked perfectly. You can also select from up to 15 unique dipping sauces to accompany your fries.  Now for my favourite part - the excellent beer menu. They had CDN craft brews from Beau's, Charlevoix Dominus, Hopfenstark, Dieu du Ciel, Nickel Brook and Sawdust city. Also a large number of international selections. Enjoying a beer at Wvrst and the associated atmosphere reminded me of the many German beer halls I have visited in the past.  For those who don't like beer (I have no idea why!), they offer a few wines.   FYI - Tables are communal style - not great if you want a quiet conversation but cool if you want to meet some new people.  I will be back... but not if I have to wait 45 minutes to get in.  BK"}
{"text":"I've been here several times, and you'll always find something that you like. They have interesting choices of sausages that you can try and the tray of fries are huge. Great atmosphere, the picnic tables are a nice touch. The selection of beer here is interesting as well. I've always liked eating here. I've met up with friends to catch up and even though it gets busy, the place is big enough that you can carry out a conversation and it doesn't feel too packed."}
{"text":"A good place to come for a couple of drink with friends. Although this place can get really busy during peak hours, my friends and i dont mind waiting in line for a good beer"}
{"text":"WOW, is how I would like to start this review off. All my meat-eating friends kept ranting and raving about this place and honestly I felt pretty left out...until I checked the menu and saw that there was 3 vegetarian options. I was pretty hesitant on going just because vegetarian \"sausage\"... I just didn't know what to expect. I went for lunch, and ordered the Black Bean Sausage with jalapenos and onions, and ordered a small order of plain fries. Probably one of the best vegetarian imitation meals I've ever had. The sausage had substance and FLAVOR, and I didn't feel left out amongst my meat-eating friend. The fries were amazing and I ordered two sauces to pair the fries with. One was a chive and roasted garlic mayo based sauce and the other a jalapeno/cilantro yogurt sauce. Both were really good, although I did prefer the roasted garlic.   The beer selection was overwhelming and kind of unrecognizable, the waiter noticed the \"deer in head-light\" look on our faces and took the time to bring us over to the bar where the draft machine was. He spent time giving us samples and recommendations until we found one we were happy with.   In other reviews I kind of bashed communal seating, but this place I wouldn't want it any other way. I can only imagine the interesting people and conversations the communal seating would bring on a Friday or Saturday night. I was happily filled and there wasn't too big of a dent in my pocket leaving. With the amount of selection of different sausages, toppings, fries and beer selection there is literally something for everyone. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Been here twice and its a pretty cool place! The sausage collection of crazy types of meat is awesome! From chicken to beef to pork to rabbit to elk to duck to even veggie options!  I'm not so sure about the fries - they're good in their own way but I guess I like my fries soggy   Great place for a casual hangout with good food and drinks"}
{"text":"kangaroo sausage is actually delicious!  duck oil fries are great to try too if you ignore the calories. I would recommend the currywvrst style"}
{"text":"Beers we re superb. Lots of imports that should satisfy a majority of beer coniseurs.   Oh wait the best part was the sausage...what a great mix.  Only had the bratwurst but will try the elk next go around.  Wasnt to impressed with the duck fat fries.  Place was large enough for big groups will long bench tables making the experience something new."}
{"text":"This place is good for when your wanting a quick casual bite and beer it is great for groups and they do their speciality well ( hot dogs) It has great speciality hot dogs. Definitely is the best Of it's kind and duke of it's trade in my book."}
{"text":"Awesome house made sausages and beer selection.  Cool German style open dining layout, very cool.  The garlic polish was killer.   Come to Chicago!"}
{"text":"Pretty good.   I came here with my mom for a 'light lunch' and we ended up getting quite a spread for only two people:  Pretzel Duck sausage with foie gras cuz YOLO Oktoberfest Sausage Duck Fat fries and 2 ciders  We ended up sharing everything. Duck sausage was sweet because of the maple: 100% get it with the foie gras  Oktoberfest sausage: savoury and even better when paired with sauerkraut  Duck Fat fries: phenominal...even better when paired with the chipotle dipping sauce and the garlic chive dipping sauce  Pretzel: nice and soft  TIP: come with a credit card so you may keep an open tap and keep adding to it.   My mom enjoyed everything and so did I. No complaints."}
{"text":"Really cool place with all kinds of sausages. Very nice vegaterian as well and pickles to die for."}
{"text":"This is one of those places you HAVE to visit once. Unless you don't like unique! It is one of those very unique Toronto gems. There is a very good range of different types of sausages, which are somewhat customizable and lots of drinks. The cafeteria seating also matches the vibe perfectly!"}
{"text":"Well here's my third review and I really think I'm starting to get the hang of yelp. For this review I thought I'd go with a throwback!  I went to Wvrst for the first time a few years back with \"the good ol' ex\" and let's just say if she approached my \"sausage\" with the same vigour she had while at Wrvst maybe we would still be dating. LOL!!! I'm sorry, that was extremely inappropriate but I'm dead serious.  Having recently returned from a trip to Munich I thought this would be a great place to take the ex on a date. We  walked in and I knew I had made the right decision immediately. From the second I saw the rich banquet style tables and the wide array of sausage and beer I knew I was in love for the first time in my life. However, my euphoria was short lived as my ex immediately told me she was not comfortable sitting a family style tables. However, her bloodlust for sausage that night was far more intense than her strong distaste towards being even the slightest bit social. So we continued up to the register to order.  She went with the Bison which I totally did not see coming. For a moment I thought, \"What an adventurous girl I've got!\". This was short lived, as I will touch upon in a moment. I went with the Boerewors, as there is nothing I love more than South Africa's signature sausage executed to perfection. We then each split an order of the duck fat fries.  After ordering we sat down to enjoy some artisan beer and scintillating dinner conversation. Our food came quite quickly considering the crowd and was delivered with a smile. The duck fat fries were amazing, it's a staple of Wvrst that I have continued to order to this day. These fries are some of the best in the city, you're really missing out if you go to Wvrst and don't order them. My boerewors was everything I hoped it would be, rich and fatty...just like my ex! Alas, I would not be able to fully enjoy it because as soon as she bit into her Bison, she spit it out and demanded that we switch meals. Being a real gentleman I agreed to swap \"hot links\" and let me tell you that her loss was my gain. This Bison sausage blew my mind. It's made with blueberry and maple according to Wvrst's menu and it is just the right mix of salty and sweet and also sexy. I highly recommend you try either one of these great sausages. We finished up the rest of our meal, agreed that it was one of the best meals we had enjoyed in a long time and went back to her place for a night of angry love making.  The only reason I can't give Wvrst a 5 is because of the undersized glasses you are forced to use while serving yourself water, both of which are annoying. At first I thought it was simply a matter of the glasses looking small in my ex's unthinkably large hands. Upon repeat visits I have realized they are, in fact, just really small glasses.  In case you haven't figured it out yet...my ex-girlfriend sucked."}
{"text":"I tried the Kangaroo sausage and it was pretty good. I think this is a good place to bring friends to try sausages that you normally don't eat, but I don't see myself coming here frequently for lunch."}
{"text":"We didn't know where we were going to eat at 10:30pm on a weekend. When we saw the entrance, we were sceptical but we proceeded anyways because our hunger. It was well worth it.  We were greeted upon entry and it had this communal hub of picnic table great for socializing. On one side was the kitchen and the other side was a bar full of the variety of beers. I have never seen so much types of beer.   The duck fries where so good as well as the various dipping sauces they had to choose from.  We were really happy with our meal and beer. It probably has the best beer selection for all types of tastebuds."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to visit this place for a while to try their \"game\" meats sausages.   The perfect opportunity presented itself this past Saturday as we were in the area and finally decided to eat here.   Nice place as it has communal benches along with high top tables and chairs. The place is set up for you to be sitting with strangers if it's get busy. However on this day, that wasn't an issue as there were space available when we arrived after 2pm.   As soon as we walked in, a waiter informed us to find a seat and handed it us a menu. Once we made a decision, we were to go up to the cashier, place the order and pay. Afterwards, they give you a metal stand with a letter and a waiter will bring you your order to your seat.   I ordered the Pheasant sausage on a bun with jalapeños and sauerkraut (cold) along with a regular order of Duck Fat Fries with the chipotle sauce. We also got the Pistachio soft serve ice cream. I have been meaning to order the Kangaroo for the longest time but decided to go with the Pheasant. I didn't regret my choice. The sausage was amazing. It was very flavourful and did not have any game meat taste. However, next time, I'll probably won't get the bun and the toppings. I also usually put ketchup on my hotdogs too, but I didn't do it. Didn't want to ruin the taste of the sausage. The Duck Fat Fries are the real deal and is a must buy. The fries are very crispy and the chipotle sauce is a great add on. Finished off the meal with the soft serve which had a perfect balance of sweet and bitterness.   They also have countless number of beers and ciders. Heck, their Drinks menu is larger than their food menu.   One knock about this place are the prices. This place is definitely not cheap as the sausages are $10 and portions are not very big.   I will definitely be coming back to try more of their sausages, guaranteed!  #41 of 2018"}
{"text":"Really fun place.  A very social environment.  We shared three sausages \"currywurst\" style.  Sausages weren't bad but not amazing.  A bit on the pricy side for just one sausage and a slice of bread. Good selection of beers though to compliment the variety of international wursts.  I figured I'd give this place a try but don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I again always have to preface this with my own personal background so that people understand where I'm coming from. I detest beer, or rather I can seem to like it no matter how many I try. I prefer and can drink a cider and I'm also not a wine person but oddly I enjoy port wine. Why am I starting out with this is; West is most likely best enjoyed if for Asians if you're familiar with an Izakaya concept, which is beer with fatty, fried, and or salty food to compliment said beverage.   Since we (my partner and I) do not drink I cannot give a review that would be able to connect with those that can appreciate beer so I apologize if I can't give more than just observations. This place has a wall of taps and a whole menu of exotic canned beers that are divided by colour as if we're wine and by other descriptive words, however I didn't pay too much attention.   What we came here for was the game meat sausages. I have a lot of confidence that if they got the game meat sausages down that their traditional sausages must be just as amazing. I got the wild boar sausage which is a mix of boar, mushroom, and tea from how the menu describes it. The sausage was topped with onions and sour kraut (although I could not find the onions or taste them). The sausage was well cooked and it was juicy with the delicious animal fat that leaked out as you take a bite. The sausage is well seasoned but is complimented by the tartness of the sour kraut and the horse radish mustard I added.   My parter got the Merguez, which is lamb and harissa and she got it in the style of currywrst. Which means that the sausage was cooked and cut up for you and served with bread and a tomato curry sauce. Now on the menu in house it just explains the currywvrst as I have and on the online menu it says in parentheses that this style is not recommended with game meats, and that double portions are available. We found that this might be the case because of the strong flavour of the spices in the curry but if the Merguez might be the exception (or at least for us it was). The spices that flavour the lamb in the sausage and the curry seems to remind us of a shakshuka without the egg. The curry is sweet, tart, and taste or the herby spices.   We also got the pretzel with cheese sauce (made of Raclette and Gouda). The cheese sauce enhances the natural saltiness of the pretzel but doesn't make it too salty unless you eat a bunch of it bite after bite. Again seems like beer would be a good accompaniment but at least we had water. I also found that the accompanying horse radish mustard added another level of complexity to the cheese if you're okay mixing the two sauces. Oh yeah the pretzel is made really well soft in the middle but with enough of a greasy texture to hold up again the cheese and mustard sauces.   We finished our meal with a salted rosemary and maple soft serve ice cream. Now I couldn't tell or taste any hint of rosemary. The ice cream was a well rounded flavour of maple because of the salt, that almost reminds you or caramel but with the woody earthiness that maple brings. I found it sweeter than my liking but because of the roundedness of the taste I ate more than I normally would. My partner said that the rosemary is very subtle and didn't too sweet but did acknowledge the sweetness.   This place would get a five star from me but and here are my critiques. The portion sizes are small, in fact when the currywvrst Merguez sausage came out my partner didn't think it would fill her up. It was surprisingly filler (for her) but I would imagine this would not be the case for most people unless you natural have a small stomach or appetite. Despite the really well made sausage I don't know if it's worth the $12 price tag for the game sausages. The same applies to the pretzel with cheese sauce which ran me a little over $7.50. Btw not a pretzel shape. This is not to say the food doesn't warrant the price but it hard for me to see the size worth that price. But I mean it you understand, enjoy, and appreciate the value of really well done small portioned food available at Tapas and Izakaya you should be able to appreciate this. But if you're think I can get a bratwurst or Italian sausage on the street corner one block east for $3-5 than this is going to be a tough sell to your wallet."}
{"text":"Had the venison burger with sauerkraut and sautéed jalapeños combined with a Weizen bier. Best meal ever. Oh and don't forget the duck fat fries!"}
{"text":"Sausage & beer. How could you go wrong with that combination? Service is always great here, the ambience is casual, the space is normally packed on Friday and Saturday evenings, and the food never disappoints. They have a good selection of sausages with options like chorizo, merguez, rabbit, wild boar ands dozen others. They also have vegetarian and vegan options available."}
{"text":"2.5.  I felt there was a lot of novelty to be had here between the different sausages and the beer hall set up, but the counter service to tray situation was not my idea of how to eat out but essentially the low rating was because I didn't feel the sausages were any better than something from a hot dog cart on the street.   I had the duck and foie gras sausage and my boyfriend had the kangaroo. They were both just ok. The sausage was very loosely packed and I found myself enjoying the bun and sauerkraut more since they had a lot more flavour than the meat.  I was excited to try the duck fat fries. They were good, but not what I expected: when I make duck fat potatoes at home they have the rich flavour of duck-- no doubt from the pan drippings. I get that they likely use clarified duck fat, but the flavour of them was no different than any other french fry. There was a definite lack of distinctive crunch or crispiness.  I didn't enjoy the wait in line, the ordering at the counter and the seek your own seat. Especially the latter, which was nerve wracking and took me back to high school cafeteria days, trying to pick who to sit with. Communal seating is not a favourite thing of mine, unless I'm actually in a German Beer Hall  in Bavaria. But getting to choose who you sit with is far too political an experience to engage in amongst North American strangers on King St. At least for this gal.  Luckily, we sat at the bar proper, and I found some relief from my agoraphobia, claustrophobia and belated high school anxiety in a cider.  Going to look into getting a medical marijuana card now...Wurst was just not my thing."}
{"text":"I ended up going to WRVST for a friend's birthday gathering - I'd never heard of it before.  I was intrigued by the idea of some delicious sausage (who isn't) and the variety of meats you can actually get.  While I liked the atmosphere, the wait in line to order was long.  Not physically long - there weren't too many people - but extremely slow.  If there isn't going to be table service (they deliver, but don't take order from tables) than at least have a quick line up.  I still don't know why it was so slow - they weren't actually giving food out at the front of the line, just taking orders...  Anyways, it was still a lovely experience.  The food was delicious, so were drinks (a different line at another counter in the same restaurant - weird) and the atmosphere was cute.  I'd definitely go back, despite the lines."}
{"text":"I've been to WVRST twice now and will keep coming back for the delicious food, drinks and friendly service!   This is a great place to take friends from out-of-town to share a casual meal in a fun atmosphere. I love how they have so many options, including a variety of great vegan and vegetarian ones. I have a few vegan friends who have all given the original and black bean sausages 2-thumbs up.   So far I have tried the elk and kranjska sausages, and the dirty and plain duck fat fries. I would highly recommend both sausages and would have them again in a heart beat! The fries are also delicious and can't be beat.   The servers there are very friendly and attentive, and willing to provide recommendations for first-timers too.  All-in-all, a 10/10 experience every time!"}
{"text":"Congratulations! You are in the right place! Your instructions:  1. Walk up the stairs 2. Stand in line to order. 3. Be adventurous and order any of the wild game options. 1 per person. Plus 1 more to share. Wow. 4. Order LARGE duck fat fries. Share with only one person. You will want to be selfish. It's ok. 5. Yes you want dipping sauce. Get 2 totally different choices for fun. 6. Pay. They take plastic. 7. Take your number and go sit at the bar. Why the bar? 8. Get to know the super awesome talented knowledgable bartenders who will let you taste any beer before you order. Holy awesome tappers Batman. 9. Eat food and groan and moan in ecstasy. A LOT. 10. Realize you need another beer. And another order of LARGE duck fat fries. 11. Do not feel guilty."}
{"text":"This is a great place, love the vibe and the crowd here.  The idea is you go in, the server will meet with you, you get seated and look at the menu, when you are ready, you go up to a counter and order your own food.  I went with a group of about 6-7 friends and had a nice casual time. We had a few orders of 'Duckfat' Fries, it was really delicious. It came with dipping sauces and I tried the rosemary/maple, it was great!  Price wise, it was a bit on the pricier side for what you get, so thats the only reason i give this a 4 stars.   There are a lot of different sausages you can try, made of different animals. I've never seen such a selection.  You get the normal ones such as beef, pork, chicken, and then you have the special one called 'Game'  These include Lamb, Bison, Rabbit, Duck, Venison, and even Kangaroo, try these if you are feeling adventurous.   Definitely a place to check out with friends casually to hang out and talk. Might not be a great place for a romantic date though, unless its a casual one. :)"}
{"text":"Visited Wvrst on a Saturday night- we waited about 10 minutes to be seated. The menu is huge and we were excited. I had chicken and artichoke sausage with sauerkraut and sweet peppers and my husband chose kangaroo with sweet peppers and onion. Our other dining companions had the original vegan (served currywurst style) and her partner had kangaroo with the melted raclette cheese. We also got the dirty duck fat fries with melted cheese. Nothing disappointed at all. Fries were nice and hearty, and the toppings were fresh and delicious. My only complaint is the buns were slightly too large BUT I love bread so it's hardly a complaint. Noise level was loud but we could all hear each other just fine. I also got a sampling of cider and they were delicious. Our companion was disappointed with the beer but he admits to being a beer snob so I don't that too seriously.   I would absolutely recommend Wvrst for any meal"}
{"text":"Would I come back? yes.  Everything is tasty. Everything tastes \"good\" at worst and it's definitely a fun experience trying out all the different meats on their menu. If you're looking for a drink, there are plenty of options too. To be honest, nothing has really stood out to me and even though I've tried four or five different meats, I can't remember any of them being that distinct. But at the end of the day, it's still a tasty meal!  The atmosphere is also really cool. Very casual. Long, shared benches, and great natural light from outside during the day and dimly lit at night."}
{"text":"It's a perfect place for eating and chatting after a long day. Fabulous atmosphere with nice beer! I especially love their hotdogs with a variety of sausages including kangaroo sausage!! :]  And you should try their dirty fries which is topped with veggies and sauce. We ordered one but got to since the waiter thought we've waited for so long for the first order."}
{"text":"I booked a table here for a group function around noon on Aug 26. I was a bit concerned as I'm from out of town and had never been here before. Some reviews said it was very noisy and in some of the photos it looked dark and dingy. I had nothing to worry about though because everything about WVRST is EXCELLENT! Everyone loved the food and the beer and cider selection is top notch. I especially loved the duck fat fries and the salad. The service was great. Our servers did everything they could to make sure we enjoyed ourselves. It was very clean and the space is big and bright during the day. I wish I was in town for a longer time so we could go here again. Five stars for this place - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Finally made it!   First point, love the decor.   Ordered the pheasant sausage on a bun with sweet peppers and some kind tomato mayo and fries prepared in duck fat.  Duck fat fries - ermergerd. Best out of everything. I never want to have anything fried in anything else ever again.   Sausage - meh. Could be personal preference. I liked my date's elk sausage better.   Service was fairly quick and friendly though I couldn't shake the feeling that the staff were annoyed because I had to have the ordering system explained to me.   Clean and spacious. Somewhat dimly lit."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that i finally checked this place out.  I came with a friend on Monday night and we split a small fries, a wild boar sausage and a kangaroo sausage. No currywurst since she hates curry.  I loved the kangaroo sausage. The rosemary was a bit overpowering, but it was very flavourful and juicy. She liked the wild boar better since it had more of that sausagy bite, but I found it a bit dry and heavy on the cilantro. It was still delicious, though. The buns that housed the sausages were incredible. Crispy and buttery on the outside, soft on the inside. The fries were pretty good, and I really liked the chive mayo that came with it.  I also really liked the atmosphere. It was pretty dead there the night we went, so we had almost the whole place to ourselves. I really liked the seating and the lighting. It felt like we were somewhere else.  I found the menu and choices a bit confusing since i'd never been there before, but the person at the counter was a huge help. The self-serve water was a nice touch, too.   The food came out quickly enough, and all the staff we encountered were very friendly.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"this was the last place we visited during our little trip to toronto and boy was it a great choice. they have an amazing selection of house made sausages from your standard beef link to your more interesting selections like kangaroo. between the 5 of us, we shared 5 different choices: beef, wild boar, kangaroo, duck, and bison. my favorites were the duck and bison. our friends enjoyed their beer selection, especially the 2014 amsterdam tempest imperial stout they just tapped the day before.  i especially enjoyed the salad we ordered.  it was a simple mixed green salad with heirloom carrots and other deliciously fresh vegetables in a nice vinaigrette. it has been quite some time since i'd had such a crisp, fresh, tasty salad such as this.  i can't forget to mention the service. we were immediately greeted by the most gracious host who introduced us to their menu and all of their wonderful offerings. everyone we encountered, from the order taker to the food runner to the busser, was courteous, friendly, and helpful.  i highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"For my birthday I wanted somewhere that was casual and had a cool vibe so I chose Wvrst.   There are several long communal tables. Everyone just grabs a seat where ever you want, unless you have a reservation. You can order food over by the kitchen area, or go to the bar to grab an alcoholic beverage; they have a large selection of different types of beers, ciders, and some wine.   I had my birthday here during the big snowstorm with a group of around 25 people. Despite the crazy weather the place was very happening and packed. Our server was very helpful, and Wvrst was great at setting aside a place for my big group. I even had my very own sign made up. Bram and Stephanie were great as I kept changing my reservation group numbers. All the staff were super friendly.  From their great selection of sausages I had the wild boar sausage and duck fat fries, which were awesome. The wild boar was nice, juicy and meaty. Anything fried in duck fat is delicious. I also tried the dirty fries, which are spicy. But I love spice so they were good. For all you South Africans if you are craving some boerewors you can satisfy your craving here.   I had an amazing birthday here. If you are looking for a place with a great selection of drinks, great food, friendly service, and somewhere that is good for big or small groups look no further."}
{"text":"Had a great night here with my friends!  Neat concept, good sausage AND fun times.  BUT, as people have said it is REALLY REALLY REALLY loud so if you're trying to catch up (as we were) it will be a total fail.  Also, it is really neat that you can sample beers before you order them.  Definitely a trendy spot right now - whether it will remain popular for long I don't know.  Also, so of the people who go here are just plain jerks.  But I was there, and I'm not a jerk so there is hope!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot for a quick bite! Cool selection of craft beers. Not your typical sit down restaurant...In fact you just go to the cash register to order so there isn't really service per say. Very unique types of meat.   I've been here three times now and they are always very prompt with service. Gets pretty packed later in the night on weekends."}
{"text":"It's really hard to find good Boerwors in the city, and WVRST has it, and it's awesome. There really is almost too much choice. I've had the wild boar as well and it is absolutely fabulous, great flavour. Good, moist sausages cooked well, with a great selection of really delicious add-on condiments. Very large serving.  The duck fat fries didn't taste like duck fat to me at all. They could do with a few more piles of standard condiments on the tables, and I found the service to the table a bit slow for cafeteria style service. I think we waited 20 minutes for our meal. Which is fine, but with this style of service I think people expect food up to the table in 10-15 minutes. If they managed expectations by giving you an estimate based on current volume when you placed your order, that might be a nice improvement. We definitely were starting to wonder if we'd been forgotten.  The look and feel inside is totally lovely and cool and photographable, but I have to say... I couldn't hear a damn thing my dining buddy was saying. I know I'm a little deaf, but the way sound bounces around in there... wow. Not easy.  Really nice bathroom, if you care about such things. I noticed they had a large communal table blocked off for a private event which looked like a great spot. The other communal tables are large enough to be with people without being WITH the people - and it's a dining/service style I'm coming to really love."}
{"text":"I came back here to celebrate my birthday with a large group and it worked pretty well!  Table service was decent but you really are better off just going up to the front, where the line-up generally isn't too bad. Given the large selection it doesn't hurt to have to wait a little bit so you can scan the menu for the right meat/beer combo (for which they have helpful suggestions).  We all left after about three hours and it was only upon exiting the building that I realized I had been given a bit of a headache by the acoustics. There isn't a soft surface in the entire place to soak any sound so once it fills up to peak dinner levels you are in a large room full of people yelling to be heard over each other's reverberated yelling...  I still give it a good grade for the insane selection, consistently delicious food and very reasonable pricing. WVRST could get me to go up to five stars if they were able to do something about the acoustics and maybe trade out a couple more of the long tables for more communal square tables like the singular example they have in one corner."}
{"text":"Fast service and delicious food make this place an Ace in my books!  Came here on a Saturday night with a group of friends. A few had been before and were raving about how good it was. They were right! From the sausage/meat selection (and bunless options) to the pickled options, it became clear this place knows what they are doing. Oh and did I mention the beer and cider selection... that has to be seen.  If you're looking for a quick and satisfying meal or to linger over a few drinks, this is an excellent spot! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and ordered the duck fries. It was probably one of the best fries I've ever eaten. The sauce made a difference as well.  Service was good and the atmosphere is more like a rustic pub style - it looks nice and blends in with their overall menu.   Would come back again."}
{"text":"Came here after dinner with a group of friends for more food!  Had the duck fat fries and a few sausages.  Don't exactly remember which ones I tried, but they were all delicious! They also have a wide selection of craft beers and ciders.  The unique atmosphere makes it a great place to hangout with friends."}
{"text":"Overrated and overpriced for what you get. The selection of interesting sausages led me to believe I was in for a real treat. I ordered something like a pheasant and green apple sausage. Pretty cool-sounding, no? But when it was cooked (and shrunk significantly) I was really disappointed by the lack of flavor. Well, it was salty, but that was it. I couldn't taste any green apple or pheasant. Hell, for all I know, this could have been a plain, ordinary sausage made of turkey, pork, whatever.  AND I was starving after. The bun was huge, but the sausage was dinky tiny. I can get a more satisfying sausage from the guy selling hot dogs on the street...and for way cheaper!"}
{"text":"Unique sausages, rich duck fat fries and plenty of cold beer and cider on tap. That's Wvrst for you. Bison, elk, kangaroo or pork meats are tastefully mixed with fresh spices, stuffed in natural casing and cooked to order.   I went for the blueberry maple bison sausage with an order of duck fat fries and a Beaver Valley cider. Take a seat at one of their communal picnic tables under the strands of hanging white lights and enjoy.  The bison sausage and Beaver Valley cider were both excellent! The fries could of used a bit more seasoning. No other complaints though. Great place. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Very broad range of rare sausages from rabit to kangaroo and duck to traditional German and Italian. Served with different fries with duck fat or regular. Lots of beers from 5 to 50$ a pint."}
{"text":"Strangely I hadn't had a chance to hit this place up until recently.  I either like jumping on board a restaurant while it's still a hidden gem, or wait until the foodie ADD dies off a little before I go.  In this case I waited and waited and waited.  The place is a little pricey for snausages, but it was worth it.  Great selection of beer.  But the key was the awesome-sauce(s) they had to choose from.  It went perfectly with the fries as well.  Boy those Jalapeno's one spicy pepper!  Love the casual-chic atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had so much fun at this place. They have a wide selection of funny meats in their sausages that make a delicious gourmet hot dog. If I would go again I would try rabbit or duck.  When we went, there was a short line up to get in. They are supposed to let people in as people leave. However we must have seen over 10 people leave yet the \"bouncer\" only let about 4 in. It was very busy on a Thursday at dinner time.  When you go in, you order at the cashier, sit down with your number, and they bring it to you when your food is ready. Note that this place is quite loud and noisy when busy and mostly made of long communal tables. It's a little hard to have a good conversation when it's so loud. The bar area was very busy too and even louder. When taking a look around I noticed the same kind of people eating there. When I was there, I saw that a few tables were booked for birthdays or other special occasions.  We got an elk hot dog (recommended by the cashier as very popular in the \"game\" section) and a kangaroo hot dog to share. We got the toppings on the side - jalapenos and sauteed onions. The elk hot dog tasted better than the kangaroo one. The meat is not as weird as I thought it would be. The jalapenos were spicy and the onions were quite good with the hot dogs. They also have various mustards and ketchup on the tables. I would definitely come back and try more if I had the chance!  We also got duck fat fries with the yogurt jalapeno dip. The fries tasted like regular fries fried in regular oil. However they were pretty good and crispy. The dip was delicious. Not spicy at all and so good I wanted to drink it.  I definitely would recommend this place. As a tourist, it is a fun thing to eat and not something that Vancouver has (I think). The price of the hot dog is a bit much ($9) but  if you think of it as a meal, it was $12.50 per person, and I guess certain meats are hard to get? Anyway, fun place for those who are adventurous with food, but also good for those who aren't."}
{"text":"Great place to go with a group or a couple of friends, you order a fancy sausage and pay for it yourself so no arguing over the bill, and they have beers and bourbons on tap with a great selection"}
{"text":"Definitely go here on a weekday as the weekends can get pretty packed. Service was great and the beer selection is huge. I really enjoyed the curry wvrst but I found the portions to be pretty small for the price. The duck fat fries were delicious and is probably the only thing worth it for the price."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  I've been here several times over the past few years and have always had a fantastic experience. The vast majority of their sausages are gluten-free as are their toppings. I'm not sure about their condiments as I don't use them. Make sure you ask them to omit the bun and mention that it's an allergy and not a personal choice. They have told me they grill the buns on the same grill, but I've never had a reaction. Note that I have a moderate intolerance and do not have celiac's disease.   The fries are fried in their own vat so they're always gluten-free. They also have increased their cider selection and now offer a flight of 6 Ontario craft ciders for $14. They also have a soft serve that I have yet to try.  I highly recommend going here for Cider Week, which runs in June every year. They offer three different flights of 6 Ontario craft ciders each, so a total of 18 ciders. The last two years they also roasted pigs and had roasted pig tacos with corn tortillas and gluten-free sauces. It was so delicious. I can't say enough good things about this place.   P.S. They also have vegan sausages and vegetarian fries (not fried in duck fat).  TL;DR most sausages are gluten-free, lots of Ontario ciders"}
{"text":"Get the duck fat fries!  They are amazing along with the variety of sausages on their menu.  I really enjoy the variety of beer and meat on offer at WVRST.  My favs are the Bison and chorizo sausages and I always have a side of the duck fat fries because they are just too delicious!!  If you like trying different beers then this is the place to go. The crazy line ups have died down for the most part but when it first opened it was a bit nuts how you'd have to wait ages to get in just to discover it wasn't even that busy inside.  Ah well, that's not an issue any longer.  If you're ever in the area make sure you pop in for some wurst and beer :-)"}
{"text":"I've been curious about this place ever since the first review came out, so I'm glad I was in the neighbourhood at lunchtime - rare since I don't work downtown.  I like the style of the place, with the long picnic benches running the length of the area.  And it was a lot of space!  The service was great, very helpful for a newbie like me.  I decided to go simple for my first time, and ordered the merguez lamb sausage with sauerkraut and pickled jalapenos.  On the side, I had a small order of duck fat fries with chipotle dipping sauce.  Yep, I like things spicy!  Made all the better by the fact that they have a self-serve cooler of ice water.  Unfortunately it seemed to be all ice when I tried to use it, but the bartender kindly came over and filled it for me.    My meal was served to me fairly quickly, and I was happy to see that I got two sausages in the bun because they were on the smaller side.  The bun itself was lovely, I believe a ciabatta?  I could be wrong, but it was fresh and delicious.  The sausages were a bit spicy on their own, so with the jalapenos I was glad I had the fries to cool my mouth.  The flavour of the merguez was fantastic, a really tasty sausage.  The fries too were great, although I'd like to compare to the regular fries to really see the difference.  The chipotle sauce was the perfect compliment to my meal, especially since I tend to find chipotle more sweet than spicy.    All in all, a nice atmosphere with very friendly staff, great sausages and fries, the only drawback is that it's a little on the pricier side ($13 for everything) but for something so unique I'm willing to fork it over.  I'll definitely be back, and I'll be bringing people with me!"}
{"text":"This place was relatively quiet when we went compared to some of the stories I've heard from others about how loud and crazy this place can get.  It's set up like a mess hall with community seating because you know, socializing is fun and the more you can pack into a place legally with the foot print you have the more cha ching you can rake in too.  After you place your order for everything at the order you are given a number and all your food items and drinks are brought to you.  This place is a place of worship for those that like tube shaped meat.  If you want a salad you stepped into the wrong place because this place revolves around the different kinds of sausages you can discover along the way.  I was feeling particularly non-adventurous and went with a pretty standard bratwurst.  I could have had wild boar or rabbit or vension but no my standard-ness kicked in and went all regular joe on me.  I did however kick it with a large duck fries which comes with choice of 2 side sauces in which I went with the spicy Wvrst and a miso-wasabi mayo.  The fries were great but the serving was freaking huge.  It's more than a sharing size but I did that anyway.  I only went with sauerkraut and your choice of 3 mustards is already on the table.  I ended up ordering a pale ale from Quebec and with the sausage, fries and drink it was about 28 bucks after tax.  That's kind of pricey for 3 items in a cafeteria style ordering place.   Still the food was good and they have a pretty diverse choice of drinks to choose from."}
{"text":"Came here on a rainy weeknight and there was no wait.  It was my first time here and when you walk in, the tables are seat yourself and is mainly made up of long wooden tables sort of like a large German beer hall.  You walk up to the counter to order the sausages and drinks you'd like and they'll bring it to you at your seat.  Condiments (mustard, honey mustard, dijon, ketchup) are available at the tables.  There's a large selection of sausages and there's something for everybody.  I tried the duck sausage which had maple and foie gras.  My friend tried the venison and the bison.  The duck didn't look that great in the display uncooked but I'm glad the girl taking my order convinced me to try it out as it was quite good.  You could taste the maple and the foie gras but it wasn't overpowering.  It was also moist and juicy.  On the other hand, I tried my friend's bison and it was also tasty, but as the meat is much more lean, it didn't have as good \"mouth feel\".  Not sure how to articulate it, but I essentially enjoyed the duck more than the bison but not necessarily due to taste alone.  Wvrst also has a great selection of craft beer on tap.  They also have a bunch of hard to find beers in bottle.  I had a bottle of San Francisco's Anchor Steam beer.  Not as great as on tap in California, but a great complement to the sausages.  I'd recommend coming with some friends and ordering a bunch of different sausages so you can share them family style and get to have a taste of everything.  I'd rate this 3.5 stars - a extra boost for the great variety and the great stock of craft beers."}
{"text":"Wvrst has forever changed my perception that sausages are boring and that vowels are a necessity. How the heck do you pronounce its name?!?  Living in Toronto, we're used to associating sausages with the millions of uninspired hot dog stands all around. Wvrst reminds us that there's more to sausages than what you'd typically get at a grocery store or a regular hot dog stand.  Located near Liberty Village on King street, Wvrst is a \"cool\" restaurant. The decor and clientele reflect that. Lots of hip young people come here. It's trendy. You place your order at the cashier, get a number, then someone will bring you your food. You sit in these long tables and don't be surprised if you sit next to a stranger when it's busy.   The food is straightforward. Just sausages, fries, and a nice selection of beer. It's a great restaurant to hang out with friends. You choose your meat, ranging from standard fares like Italian Sausage to more exotic meats like Kangaroo. It comes with the best tasting hot dog bun I've ever had. It's crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. You get your choice of 2 toppings. The sausage tastes awesome. It doesn't taste like it's made in a factory. You can really taste the meat and the seasoning. They don't use any industrial additives (I think).   What stunned us was the size of the large dirty duck fries. Holy crap it was a full tray of fries with  veggies. Enough to serve 3. We didn't finish despite being so hungry.   No review is complete by me without a commentary on price. On one hand, paying $9 for a game meat hot dog seems pricey at first, but remember that there's no substitute for this kind of quality. The sausage was pretty large. The traditional sausages are $6 each but some of these can be purchased from the street vendors a bit cheaper. However, I think the awesomeness of the buns and toppings makes it worth it. And when I think about my large fries, I feel I got my bang for my buck. Will come again."}
{"text":"I like this place a heck of a lot better when I'm drunk.    When you're drunk, you don't care as much about what something costs or how loud it is.  The place is full of douche-assholes as well, which are also a lot more tolerable when you're hammered beyond belief.  I was at the bar, ordering a drink when a fellow came up and slapped me on the back saying \"What are you drinking?\"     I pointed to my hat.  \"Wine-hef-stephan or something. I can't remember. It's expensive though, around 14 bucks.\" I said.   \"Oh yeah? I don't care because I'm rich.\" he said.  \"Do you know any loose women?\"  (not the exact words he used)  This place is redonculously LOUD too.    GET OFF MY LAWN"}
{"text":"I highly recommend you check this place out if you're looking for a quick bite at a fair price. but want to add a little unique flare of high quality food to your day, instead of going to a chain. I'm from out of town, so I had heard about WVRST via an episode of The Layover: Anthony Bourdain, and it did not disappoint!  I had the wild boar and dirty duck fat fries (which can be shared between 2-3 people). The boar was delicious, almost a little sweet at times but greatly seasoned, and the various mustards on the table enhanced the flavors greatly. The bun was soft but not squishy, and somewhat flakey ... one of the best sausage/dog buns I've had, I wish more people did this! The duck fat fries were alright, I wasn't a huge fan of the tangy sauce on top. I think you can skip the fries -- you're not missing much.  I had somewhere to go but otherwise I wanted to try one of the beers off their extensive and well-curated beer list. I also love the decor, and the design is beautiful, clean, and modern. I thought it was pretty great that you could buy the various brats uncooked to take home too, perfect for a foodie summer BBQ!"}
{"text":"***1/2 stars  Wvrst has been open for about 4 weeks and I now know why its already getting so much buzz - the sausages are yummy!  I came here after work at about 5pm to a rather empty restaurant.  Set-up in true beer hall fashion with communal tables and a bar - it is quite a spacious restaurant!  I ordered the Currywurst with a Kranjska sausage (think Kielbasa), a root beer, and side of duck fat fries with Rosemary Maple dip.  My DC had the duck sausage on a whole wheat bun with caramelized onions and sauerkraut.  If you try nothing else, just try the Currywurst.  It was DELISH!  It had a curry flavor to it with the tanginess and acidity of the tomato which made for an interesting melange of flavors.  It is served as a sliced up sausage topped with curry sauce and 2 slices of bread.  The duck fat fries were disappointing as they tasted like normal fries to me.  The duck sausage with maple foie gras was also yummy.  The hot dog bun is very fresh, crusty and tasty!  I found the onions and sauerkraut overpowered the flavor of the actual sausage as both were quite powerful toppings in their own right.  The root beer was pretty sick!  Made with 100% Cane Sugar - it was not a cavity-wrenching sweet.  The Pilsner that the cashier recommended was also top notch.  Verdict:  All in all, I think that Wvrst is a unique new restaurant on the Toronto scene.  I mean, we all dole out almost $4 for the street-vended sausages - why not pay a few more bucks for more exotic options?  I will definitely be back to try the bison, guinea fowl and pheasant varieties.  Kangaroo anyone?    It should be noted that the small fries usually only comes with one dip, but the cashier did say I could have 2 - but in the end, they only brought one.    Condiments are aplenty at every table with 3 different types of mustard (regular, dijon and grainy) as well as ketchup.    At the end of the day, for a beer, a root beer, 2 sausages and a small fries, $33 does seem rather steep - but I left feeling quite full!  It may not be the best, but its not the \"Wvrst\"!  This would be a great place to go with a group of friends - good times are guaranteed!"}
{"text":"love the atmosphere, decor, and food! I was looking up restaurants in toronto on yelp and there were plenty of good ones, but I wanted something different. then wrvst caught my eye: I've never had german, I liked the layout of the long tables, and I was impressed that they also had vegetarian/vegan options. I tried the vegan original and the vegetarian mediterranean - my favorite! we also got fries with some amazing sauces."}
{"text":"The downside: Wvrst is comically trendy, insanely loud, and fairly slow during peak times. Basically it's a restaurant and bar on King West in Toronto.  The upside: Everything else, including prices (in my opinion, given the quality). The Kangaroo sausage was cooked perfectly and deliciously seasoned. My wife decided to benchmark the standard Italian sausage, but with the tomato curry option instead of a bun. The Italian sausage worked surprisingly well in the mild but flavorful curry sauce. (The curry dish comes with a fresh slice of bread should you wish to soak up maximum goodness.)  The duck fat fries were so very good; they were rich enough that a small order between the two of us was more than enough.  Finally, the epic-length beer list is one of the best I've seen for its carefully selected mix of unique Ontario craft brews and German standard bearers.   The essence of Wvrst: Come for the sausage, stay for the beer (and the party atmosphere if it suits you)."}
{"text":"Amazing place, amazing food, amazing atmosphere, amazing beer selection.  The sausages are unbelievable!  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Clean with unusual eats!  Everything here looks like it is made with quality and an eye for out of the ordinary.  Every bite was a wonderful sensation of quality and taste.  We had an order of elk and kangaroo, nice, the elk was better and both were good.  The staff favorites were the venison and boar.  Duck fat fries were nice but when paired with the dipping sauce made for a stellar experience. Do yourself a favor and get the maple rosemary, so good.  Which they have an ice cream of that is also nice.  The beer sampler was nice, my favorite being the king.   The cost was more than I would spend for an everyday meal but I would gladly come back for more on occasion.  If you are visiting this place is a must visit."}
{"text":"I recently had lunch with my friend at Wvrst. It has hip communal seating and soft lighting from the Christmas lights hung on the ceiling.  The overall ambiance here is welcoming and it is perfect for groups as well as diners who come alone.   The gimmick for me here are the gamey meats. Wvrst caters a host of sausages made from meats that are not commonly found in restaurants in the GTA.  For example, they have elk, bison, pheasant, and even kangaroo sausages. Unfortunately, when I tried the kangaroo sausage, it didn't taste very distinct from regular beef or pork sausages. Maybe I should have gotten the elk sausage as I've heard from several others that the elk has the most distinct gamey flavour.  At the very least the sausages here are juicy and every bite will be crispy and hot (in temperature).    My friend and I also shared a side of duck fat fries. Unfortunately, they were very underwhelming.  They tasted like regular fries that were extra oily, and the kimchi mayo that came with them was rather bland. They were nothing special to write home about in all honesty.   However, I will admit that I love the selection of condiments. They have honey mustard, Dijon mustard, ketchup and, my personal favourite, the garlic sauce. I usually don't see honey mustard and garlic sauce at hot dog vendors, so I was stoked. Whip them onto your hot dog and you're golden!   I think Wvrst has a lot of potential that I haven't experienced first-hand. Currently, nothing really hooks me, but I'm sure I will find it more enjoyable when I try a few more items in the future (Eg. The elk meat and the pretzels). I will update my review then."}
{"text":"Great place on King W I will definitely return.  Had the Bratwurst with kraut and onions with duck fat fries.  The brat was the best I have had (so far) the seasoning and flavors of the sausage were on point.  Fries were just ok..I have had better frites elsewhere.  Staff were pleasant, and efficient as were the runners. Restaurant and bathrooms were extremely clean."}
{"text":"Found this place while walking around spadina while on yelp. When I saw kangaroo sausage I knew I had to try it. Nice place with a bar like environment and welcoming staff. They have a large assortment of beer from almost every country and a long list of game meats to go along the beer.   I ordered the kangaroo sausage for $9 including two toppings with a large ducks fat fries which were around $10. For the beer, I got a Belgium ale that I can't pronounce or remember. The duck fat fries were delicious, came in a large tray topped with sweet peppers and jalapeños. The duck fat wasn't really noticeable but you can tell it was there. Now for the highlight, kangaroo sausage !!! Despite it being a game meat, it didn't taste gamy at all. The meat was juicy and tender, definitely a new taste. Would definitely come back again to try all the other game meats."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. There are several great pubs in the hood. Go to Bar Wellington instead. I went to meet my husband and some friends who were already inside and I was told I would have to wait behind a line of ppl. I spoke to the manager and he has the \"wurst\" customer service training. And let's get real...sausages? Really? Will never go and will tell everyone I know to never go"}
{"text":"Wvrst is a regular rotation on my King West list. Great people watching, fun vibe, and quick service. The only downside is it gets so incredibly busy there might be long lines to get in on Thursdays with the after work crowd - and that's not surprising. They're known for the dirty duck fat fries for a reason. The communal tables are great for groups, and the location makes it an easy stop before you move on to your next bar on Friday nights."}
{"text":"Delicious sausages, beer steins, fries with hot peppers and curry wurst - all combined with a fun atmosphere and friendly service. Can't think of anything to complain about!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite. While I enjoyed my pricey turkey and chicken sausage, it was too hot (temp wise) for me to enjoy the heat from the jalepenos in it. I think if I came again I would try my sausage sliced up in the currywvrst style as opposed to the traditional bun style. Also would try the duck fat fries... seems to be pretty popular.  I like the communal tables although the after-work crowd dominates this place (along with everywhere else on King West). I can see why, it's dimly lit, has beer, fries and sausage... why wouldn't they be here? I do wish the lighting was a bit better. It's nice in the bright summer hours but I wonder how dark it feels in there during the night time?  It seems like a fun, friendly place to go for a quick, no fuss bite (except the choices could be considered fuss... there's a lot of options on that tiny menu!!). Also the family next to us got soft serve in a cup and it was just so cute! My date and I were pretty worn out from all our walking earlier in the day, so we just wanted to eat and leave. But for my next visit, I am DEFINITELY getting myself soft serve!"}
{"text":"This place is great. A really loud, fun atmosphere where you order upfront and then you sit at big communal tables just like the beer houses in Germany.  The sausage selection is great -- I've had the Wild Boar, the Calabrese and the Mediterranean -- and they also have a ton of choices for beer and cider.    No matter what sausage you go with, make sure to get the award-winning duck fat fries and try a side of the Riesling wine barrel fermented sauerkraut; it's delicious."}
{"text":"Really love this place. Very good selection of game meats. The duck fat fries are to die for and they have beer, what else do you need? The price is great and the food quality is incredible. The service is also good. One of the reasons I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"If you're looking to try some of the most bizarre sausages on King St... without succumbing to a street vendor... Wvrst is your spot. The duck fat fries are amazing, and the selection of beers is perfect for a meet-up with friends. Definitely worth a stop.  Disclaimer* leave your vegetarian friends at home."}
{"text":"This place is great to grab a bite before going out, I don't recommend it as a final destination, although you could sit here for a long time if you were so inclined. The sausage is excellent and the micro-brew selection is unique.   Go casually with a group, not a good 1-on-1 place for date or casual dinner."}
{"text":"Was here only once but the sausages were amazing!  Great beer selection and quality pints.  This is a serious beer place with quality beers.  I think the vibe changes at night when it gets packed but during the day on the weekday when it's almost empty it's a really cozy great vibe.  The only thing I didn't like but won't let that change my rating is that if you order a flight they only give you a certain type of selection so if you go there to try lot of new beers you can't really do it by ordering beer flights...maybe they changed this by now, I found it really bizarre that you can't select your beers in a flight."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. Very casual, perfect spot for big groups or a date. Was full but never felt crowded, they control the flow of people very well. Try the kangaroo sausage, my group tried several sausages, everyone's favorite was kangaroo. Not sure what beer we drank, tried 4, all tasty."}
{"text":"I ordered the oktoberfest sausage with the sautéed jalapeños and sautéed onions.  The sausage was underwhelming.  I don't know if it was because I had high expectations for this place - but I preferred sausage from street vendors over this.   Service was excellent . We also ordered the dirty duck fat fries and they were delicious.   We ordered the large and split among 4 people."}
{"text":"Fantastic, hearty fast but real food. Had the Wild Boar currywurst style. Curry was perfectly spicy and sausage was crispy, flavorful. My husband had the Tamworth with peppers and melted cheese on a bun. He said it was amazing. We also enjoyed the duck fat fries with the mushroom truffle dip which I died over. Atmosphere is fun, pub family style tables and they have a healthy list of beers and cider. Wish we lived closer, I would come here regularly!"}
{"text":"Cool place for different types of hot dogs! I had the vegan original sausage and it was very good. We got a side of fries with Swiss raclette, and that was a bit disappointing, as only a small section of fries had cheese on them. I liked that they have bench-style tables and you go to the counter to order and get a number for your items to be delivered. I also really enjoyed the self-serve water station, as I drink a LOT of water when I eat at restaurants and often have to wait around for a server, so that was super convenient. I would come back to try another vegan sausage if in the area. Overall a good experience :)."}
{"text":"The Wvrst Restaurant in Toronto!  I believe that ground animals are indeed a good thing. The more foreign the animal, the more intriguing and likely I will order it. Wvrst does this. They offer the \"coolest\" selection of sausages you can find.  Kangaroo, Guinea Fowl, Duck+Fois+Maple, Rabbit, Venison, Pheasant, etc. There are tons to choose from, on a bun or curried.  I had my Duck sausage with kraut and onions on a bun. However I did hear wonderful things about the curried option, which i will definitely try next time. Along with the sausage were my duck fat fries. Served with a side of rosemary/maple sauce. The combo is addictive. I would go back just for the fries, they are crispy, salty and delicious.  Their Wall of Beer is cool too. Probably over 10 taps sticking out of a wall beside the ordering counter. You can't miss it, its wide and stretches across end to end. The hall style restaurant/bar was very welcoming. I like this layout a lot and I can imagine holding larger parties here, reservations made two weeks prior at least.  Overall, the spacious layout and friendly atmosphere welcomes meat/sausage lovers to expand their horizons. The variety is more than enough and the fries are the perfect compliment with the beers on tap. Imported for your pleasure, just like their meats and foodcentric ideals."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere to hang out with a group of friends and have some good beer , sausage and fries.   Big communal tables are perfect for big groups. There are smaller tables too for couples or smaller groups.  Really friendly and helpful service.  Dirty duck frites is awesome. Large is enough for 4 people.  Big fan of this place after the first visit, looking forward to going there often."}
{"text":"Fantastic hidden gem on King West. They have a variety of \"basic\" sausages if your not feeling adventurous, as well as a great variety of game meat sausages. I would highly recommend the elk sausage. The other great option is the duck fat fried French fries. They give you 2 house made dips with the Large fries and 1 with the small. The Garlic and chive dipping sauce is fantastic. They also provide a deep menu of beers to choose from, both on tap and in bottles. One of my favourites is the 1 litre stein of beer. The overall look and feel is that of a German beer hall, and it's a great casual dining experience."}
{"text":"My partner and I had the WVRST dinner ever! We like to do puns.  This was actually so delicious! We had the Oktoberfest sausage with sauerkraut. We also had melted gouda on top of the sausage as well. Super delicious. The flavour profile was awesome and we hope to try other, more non traditional flavours. There are so many different options that cater to so many different people, even vegetarians and vegans!   We also had the duck fat fries, which were DELICIOUS! The truffle mushroom mayo was to die for!   Served up on a silver tray, it seemed very communal. The atmosphere was communal as well, with the large picnic benches that took up the huge space. The service was very helpful, despite the busy Friday night crowd!   My partner was impressed with the beer selection. I had an apple cider called Mendip Hills. Very, very delicious.  I cannot wait to come back and go through the whole menu - eventually."}
{"text":"After coming back more than a handful of times, this is still one of Torontos unique eats. Love the different meats I've tried various times, in both the bun style and currywurst styles. Can't go wrong with any choice really - my favourite go to now is the Kangaroo one.  Lots of beers available for beer lovers.  And not only are the duck fat fries still awesome with their many flavours of dips, but their soft serve with duck fat fry bits are delicious too (although tiny that you may want a second!)."}
{"text":"Cannot get enough of their variety. They serve their food very quickly and the restaurant has a very cafeteria feel. Very casual and chill!  Definitely a different way to experience eating sausages without it being street meat!  They are decently priced, in addition, their beer selection is also very wide which goes well with the sausages!"}
{"text":"Impressive selection of sausages and beer! (not that kind of sausage!)  I tried their Game Sausage - Guinea Hen for $9.50. They add 2 toppings; their giardiniera/pickled veg is worth a try ($2 extra). Although it was pretty good, my only complaint is that this is a bit pricey for sausage on a bun. I regret not trying the fries.   Their range of beers was even more impressive. There were hundreds of dark, wheat, malt, hopped and pale beers, ciders, wines ... more choices than you can wrap your head around.  Great casual atmosphere, but can get crowded and loud. You order your food at the cashier (or grab a seat at the bar), grab a number sign, find a seat and they'll bring you the food. There's benches all over (high school all over again?)"}
{"text":"Let's be honest, this place is a hyped up hipster cafeteria. The food came in trays, there were benches to sit on with cafeteria style seating, and a long tiled wall leading to the bathroom.   The PBR was 10 dollars... I don't care if it's a liter. It's still PBR. It's not supposed to be the most expensive beer on your menu. The food was pretty interesting, i tried a bite of the kangaroo meat, and I had some of the bison. It was a really novel thing, but I suspect in the future I would prefer the street meat for 3 bucks over the rare game meat for 9. However, i definitely like the idea, and trying something new was fun.  I liked the place, it was definitely worth trying. However, you have to be able to look past the cafeteria-ish setting, which while interesting, would probably wear thing on me eventually.  I liked the place, I might go back to try the pheasant, but I'm not exactly head over heels."}
{"text":"Awesome find. We ordered the oktoberfest and venison sausages and the dirty duck fat fries. All was very delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Great sausages and great beer. This place is great and I really enjoy the food and the beer here."}
{"text":"PROS: 1. Great atmosphere for food and drinks with friends. Nice decor. 2. Food is scrumptious! Sausages are savory and the bun adds the right amount of carb-so good!  CONS: 1. None that I can think of, except it's hard to get a good seat without resos on a busy night- but no biggie, space fills up."}
{"text":"I checked out Wvrst with my coworkers a couple weeks back, and I think I've mentioned it to at least a dozen different people since!  It definitely leaves an impression!  I like the community picnic-table seating.  It was perfect for a mid-week lunch, though I'm not sure it would be an ideal setting on a Friday or Saturday night.  I also liked that I could just go up to the counter and order what I wanted.  No waiting on hurried wait-staff.  The sausage selection is great.  Do you want spicy?  Are you vegan?  Do you want something a little more traditional and safe?  There are options for every type of eater here, which makes it A+ for a group setting.  I ended up with an italian sausage with onions, an order of duck-fat fries (definitely a must), a dipping sauce (also a must), and a bottle of fancy root beer for just under $17.  A bit pricier than I normally spend on lunch, but it was so filling that my coworkers had to roll me back to my desk to finish out the afternoon."}
{"text":"The place is a nice open space - I'm not usually a fan of long communal dining tables, but as long as you go when it's not too busy (which, from casual observation from street level, seems like all the time), it's kinda neat since you wind up getting all the room you need to sprawl out.  As far as the food goes, though, Wvrst is the worst.  Portion sizes are tiny, which goes against what one's brain associates with a German bierhaus, and the sausages we've had were overcooked to the point of being sausage jerky.  We've gone twice just to rule out the possibility that this was a fluke, but sad to say, it was equally icky the second time around.  Fries were average, bread was meh.  Might be good for the drinking crowd, but if you want a satisfying meal, this place isn't going to give it to you."}
{"text":"Hot dog? Hot DAMN! Who doesn't like a juicy sausage? I know I sure do.   Wvrst is a noisy mess-hall type establishment that reminds me of high school, but with less cliques, more alcohol, and actually good food. On Friday evening at 6:15pm, it was like getting into the club. There was a line that went down the stairs and out the door, with bouncer-type dudes letting people in whenever other people left. When you get inside, everyone is sitting beside each other at large wooden tables, or lining up at the ordering station or bar. You'll never get bored of their drink list, as they have a very long list of beers on a rotational basis. Not as many affordable options for cider and the one I got had a funky aftertaste (reminds me of the way a farm smells).  If hot dogs and fries are your thing, then Wvrst is your home because that's pretty much all they serve. They've got regular sausages, and then game sausages (bison, rabbit, kangaroo???) done two ways: hot dog style or currywurst style. Currywurst means chopped up with tomato curry and a piece of bread, all served on a wooden platter. Game sausages aren't recommended for currywurst style though.   I tried the wild boar (with mushroom and tea) with sauerkraut and caramelized onions. Definitely a fan of the sausage, it was juicy and exploded on impact. I regret putting a little too much ketchup as I think the taste of the meat itself was fantastic. Also got a large order of their award-winning duck fat fries. Even though I didn't really taste duck fat, they were some of the best fries I've ever had. They come with two dipping sauces and I highly recommend the black pepper.   There are two things I regret not trying. One: the rosemary soft serve with crispy duck bits, which must be some sort of heavenly dinner/dessert hybrid. Two: you can add cheese to your hot dog. But not just any cheese. They grab a wheel of raclette cheese, melt/slightly burn the top with a lamp torch device, and scrape all that gooey goodness straight onto your dog. If you could describe cheese as sexy, this would be the time.   (49/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"Lots of seating. Duck fries are amazing. Exotic meat choices. Fun and loud environment. Many alcohol choices. Slightly pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"They said this place topped the \"best of\" lists for both hotdogs/sausages Annnd French fries in Toronto..... Now I know why. Upon arriving,  I was greeted by one of the waitresses who broke down the rules per se of how to order tgeir food. Essentially, you choose what kind of sausage you want (where each is listed with a description of what type of meat and spices it consists of), and get your choice of 2 complimentary toppins (from I believe a choice of 5 potential toppings). Once you order, you're given a number, told to have a seat wherever you pleasr, and your food is brought to you shortly after. I ended up deciding on the brautwvrst for $8 (a mix of veal and pork) with sauted onions and saurkraut as my 2 toppings. The quality of the meat in their sausages is sooo surprisingly high.....normally when I eat sausage,  I expect some weird/chewy pieces, but there was absolutely nothing weird about my brautwvrst!  Along with the quality sausage,  I grabbed an order of the notorious duck fat fries, claimed to be the in the city. An order of fries also gets you a free dipping sauce, where I opted for a roasted garlic flavour. Needless to say, I was extremely impressed,  and could not have agreed more! I guess there's just something about cooking fries in duck fat that makes them taste that much better!!"}
{"text":"We got the KANGAROO & RABBIT SAUSAGE ($9 each) and DUCK FAT FRIES (large $7). Honestly, I would rather eat a street dog for the price but daaaaamnnn those duck fat fries gonna keep me coming back for the heart attack. This place didn't wow me as much as I was expecting it to and don't think it's the greatest place to go to for a date."}
{"text":"Tasty sausages. Fries are excellent. Great selection of beers. Really happening spot on King St. Usually quite busy. Hard to get a table around dinner time especially on the weekend. Expect a wait. It is a tad overpriced tho for what you get."}
{"text":"3.5-4 rating.  i love the concept of this place almost an open cafeteria setup.  great for shmoozing and conversation withbfrirnds and or strangers.  a true beer hall with great rare beer selection.  the foid was good not great but only had food once.  this place gets packed fast on the weekends.  very very loud."}
{"text":"This place is happening!! It is always packed and full.  This is a good 'evening bar crawl place\" The set up of this place is a little funny --- You order your beers and food and then find a seat. It is like PICNIC table set up . Long benches all spread out in rows in the room.  There's also a sit down bar (good if you are just here with 1 other person) but if you are here with a large group, you'll need to sit down at the long benches.   I like how they have changing beer selection. Last time my friend and I had some delicious cider but I forgot the name NOW =( and I tried looking for it at LCBO with no luck.   I enjoyed eating the duck fat fries! ANYTHING cooked in duck fat is YUMMS!!!  I'll come back to drink some more and snack some more... not really a 'food filling' place. More for Drinking and snacking"}

{"text":"This place is fantastic - great food, great selection of beers/ciders! It is especially ideal for groups because you order and pay for your food at a counter, they give you a number and it is brought to you - so you don't have to worry about splitting up the bill at the end!  I came for the cider week event and was not disappointed. It was busy and I had to wait in line, but it was really organized and moved fairly quickly. The prices were surprisingly reasonable as well."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come for gatherings, large or small groups, casual drop in or just to unwind after a long day of work.  It's pretty simple here - you order sausages from the list of game meats or traditionals on their menu, and you order beer from their seemingly unlimited selections of beer.   Have tried the kangaroo on a bun, and elk, venison, merguez currywvrst style. All were good, I enjoyed the merguez and elk more.  I recommend getting the sausages in currywvrst style so that you can taste each type of meat and the spices that go into them. Having the sausage in the bun is fine but the flavors won't be as intense.   Duck fat fries or dirty duck fries are a must. Dirty duck comes with sautéed peppers, onions, and jalapeños.   If you still have room, try their salted maple rosemary soft serve ice cream. It's a flavor you won't normally find elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm still a fan after last being here six months ago.  Great selection of beers and good food.  Pommie Cider and frites w chive'n'garlic dip. Da. Bomb."}
{"text":"Kangaroo, duck, deer, and regular old beef and pork. WVRST has a generous variety of meats (hormone free) at very generous prices ($6-9 per dog). Duck fat fries are as unhealthy and delicious as they sound. Good selection of beers from Canada, US, Europe, Mexico....The only nuisance is having to place the food order yourself (no table service) for which you are likely to wait in line at least 20 minutes on a busy night. But because its so delicious and fun here, I can't strip away a star for that. Great music, big space, tall ceilings, communal seating, and lots of great meat!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night and there was no wait, but this place was definitely decently packed. We were able to get some seats at a communal table. You order at the counter and then get a number and they bring you your food.   We got the: BERKSHIRE PORK honey/garlic on a TOASTED FRESH BUN with SWEET PEPPERS and SAUERKRAUT. CHICKEN artichoke/basil with the CURRYWVRST style.  DIRTY DUCK FRIES (Peppers, jalapeños and sauteed onions topped with our WVRST special sauce)  Everything was really good, but I think everything is better when it first comes out nice and warm. The cooler the food got, the less tasty it was (or was I getting more full?) Anyways, would definitely stop by here especially if you're out with friends and wanted a snack and some drinks. I don't really drink, but they had a really extensive drink menu."}
{"text":"My GF and I have been here twice in the past month. We're Pescetarians though so a lot of the sausage options are lost to us, admittedly.  That said, the veggie sausages are delicious. The options for us were Soy (Pastrami) Tofu (Italian&Kielbasa) Fennel (Sicilian)  Over the course of our two visits we tried them all. My favourite was the Sicilian, which seemed the most complicated, flavour-wise, but they were all really great.  The beer selection is also top-notch, and they give you an exorbitant amount of fries if you order a large. Even if you're super hungry, you'll need 2 other people to share a large dirty fries. We brought our leftover fries to Shakespeare in the Park's version of \"Taming of the Shrew\" (2 stars for a mediocre \"modern update\" of the text, and also it is 2013, we can stop making jokes about how Starbucks names their coffee. When Tom Hanks used similar commentary in 1998's \"You've Got Mail\" it was already not particularly timely) and sadly our leftovers were plundered by ants.  \"Holy crap I'm full\" - Ant #1 \"There's still 30 more giant potato girders left\" - Ant #2 \"Hmmm maybe we can invite 700 of our friends to help us finish\" - Ant #1 \"Yeah great tell them to bring some Fanta\" - Ant #2 \"LOL good one. Seriously though I'm so thirsty.\"  The only reason I give this a 3-star review is that, honestly, it's Sausage. Like, even if I were a meat eater, I really don't know if a Sausage is the best way to showcase all the different varieties of meat. It seems kind of a waste. Meanwhile, delicious as the veggie sausages are - I don't know that the price validates how much more tasty they are then, say, a veggie sausage from a street vendor. It's a great space, but I think it works far better as a kind of gimmicky drinking destination than a restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night. Loved the atmosphere and the communal seating. It's a great place if you are looking for a unique outing in the city. They serve a bunch of different kinds of sausage, fries, and soft pretzels. I ordered an Italian sausage (with peppers and onions), soft pretzel with Dijon mustard, and a sparkling glass of red wine. Everything was amazing and pricing was pretty good. However if you are super hungry, I'm not sure if this would fill you up.  That being said, I really enjoyed this place and would definitely return with a bunch of friends for a night out!"}
{"text":"I really like the casual atmosphere of this place. The selection of sausages they have is much better than most places. They also have a huge selection of beer too, although I didn't get to try today. I would say the prices are mid ranged to pricy in the area.  I really enjoyed the food and I would come back next time to try their selection of beer."}
{"text":"I firmly believe that you can never have a bad time at WVRST after my nth visit to this place.  The place offers a very hip/trendy but casual vibe and is a place where you can just sample their vast selection of craft beer, cider, and more with a group of peeps.  This time the occasion was cider week in Toronto and WVRST was hosting the par-tay.  They were very much properly organized so that it wasn't chaos when the doors opened for this event (and it proved to be popular).  The service was fast and attentive as always and they even did a special apple-brined pork to celebrate cider week that was very tasty.  Look forward to my (nth + 1) trip to WVRST in the future."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a gourmet sausage when that Toronto street dog isn't quite doing it for you. I tried the chicken-turkey sausage with the Giardiniera, as well as the duck-fat fries; the meat was tender and the fries left us wanting more. Finally, they have a great selection of craft beers that will wash down great with your meal!"}
{"text":"This is a review on the kangaroo sausage.  My first time having kangaroo. After that sausage, I can say I have no clue what kangaroo tastes like. For all I know, it could have been a really dry pork sausage. I like my sausage not to crumble in my mouth. This one did. Flavor-wise, it was not bad. Slightly smokey with a nice blend of herbs and spices. It was the texture that threw me off.   The kraut that came with was fairly good. The bun was too. Nice grill marks. I wish the bun and the sausage were the same size though, or that the sausage was bigger than the bun. I don't like taking bites of just bun.  With the number of game sausage choices, I will most likely be back, but not for the kangaroo. Once was enough."}
{"text":"i vaguely recall walking into a dark cave lit by candle lights and greeted by the sound of tavern goers....the wooden door shuts behind me and lets out an eerie sound...i'm welcomed by a friendly yet suspicous pair of eyes...  the eyes greeted my party as we sat down, order by the counter and we will bring the food to you my sire  i chose to procure a table for my weary party of 3....the long table shared among 3 other parties of adventurers who also stumbled upon this humble hoven   the rest of my party members leave to make the order, at long last, my meal arrives....some tamworth pork, with sweet peppers and sauteed jalapenos...i dig into the food ravenously...devouring it in less than half a moon's time...  \"that was good\" i said...as i wipe my lips with napkins at the tableside...let us be off"}
{"text":"Anthony Bourdain, once again, has led me to a meat-eaters paradise.  I've been to Toronto maybe 10 times over the past couple years, and I'm so angry at myself for just discovering this place now!  I haven't been to Germany, but Wvrst served up the BEST brat that I've ever had.  Not even close.  Starting with the bun, absolute perfection!  Maybe the best delivery mechanism for food that I've ever consumed (mechanisms include: buns, bread, hoagies, rolls, etc).  I shouldn't have been, but I was shocked at how perfect the bun was for the bratwurst.  The brat needs no explanation--perfectly cooked, beautiful in every way.  It was topped perfectly (I'd keep it simple with maybe onions and kraut, forget the jalepenos), with a choice of fine mustards provided at the table.  And to top it off.....duck fat fries with some purely Canadian maple rosemary sauce!    Really great food, really trendy vibe....highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We went to WVRST just last Friday after work with a few friends.  It was my first time at WVRST and one of my friends suggested we go there early to beat the crowd... Man was he rite.  Located conveniently on 1.5 floor (not exactly the second floor but you do have to climb a few steps) at King/Porter (next to LEE) you cannot miss this place.  The decor reminds me of GUU and WAGAMAMA (UK) 1/2 service--You do have to line up at the cashier to place your order and the food will be served to you when ready.  Back to the food..there're only 2 choices: CURRY SAUCE or BUN.  With the curry sauce, the sausage will be sliced topped w/ their signature curry/tomato sauce served w/ bread on the side.  With the bun...well, it's just a bun...   Along with the shallow 2 choices came a variety of meat and the options are endless.  (they also serve game meats like duck and venison and rabbit and they don't suggest you mix game with curry)  there're also 2 types of fries.. regular or duck fat!  I ordered both to see the difference and the result... not much.  the duck i find has more flavor to it and not as crispy as regular but after the different types of sauces and ketchup that comes w/ the fries... you really can't taste any difference.  Overall impression... WVRST is a good pre-party dinner/drink place on a Friday nite and prices are not overly expensive but be sure to get there early on weekends.  PS -  I'd suggest putting the curry sauce on the side.  As great as the curry sauce is...if you pour the entire sauce on the sausage... you will not taste the sausage.  PS2 -  If you're a beer  drinker (who isn't?) order the 1 litre mug... lining up again (although they have a bar that serves alcohol) is just a Biatch  PS3 -  Although not mandatory, a $5 tip is greatly appreciated by the staff."}
{"text":"The meat here is delicious!  We loved the chorizo and chicken with artichoke and basil.  The meat was super moist and the tomato curry sauce was perfect!  We also ordered the black bean sausage, which paled in comparison because it was so dry.  Under the tomato curry sauce it was fine, but I wouldn't order it again.  The duck fat fries were also fantastic.  They were so rich and perfectly crisp.  We ordered the sweet chili and wvrst dips, but they looked and tasted the same.  Overall it was a terrific meal and a place to remember.  The prices were right. Also fantastic for gluten-free/Celiac people!"}
{"text":"Great Food and Great Beer!  The restaurant itself looks like a beer hall and the steins are an awesome plus!  My recommendation is the dirty frys, a Schneider and Brothers beer and a BratWvrst!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Friendly servers and counter folk. Dirty Duck Fries were the best! Seated at long picnic tables. Might be noisey for some but we (4) had a great time. The flight of ciders was a unique idea and very tasty.  Finish off the meal with the soft ice cream.  Perfect night!  Thank you."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with a friend from the states with only one request from her: I want to eat Canadian food.   So yeah this place doesn't look Canadian but it has some great stuff so I figured why not. I love that the interior looks like a giant German Oktoberfest hall. All the tables are communal so you are encouraged to be social. The atmosphere is very friendly and bright. It's mainly a beer scene but their sausages are delish.   I ordered a pheasant sausage (apple and sundried tomato) with sweet peppers and sauerkraut, all for $9.75. I also got duck fat fries (5.75) and smoked gouda (4.75) on top. I was allowed one dip so I chose chives and roasted garlic. Total with tax was ~$22 but it was delicious.   The pheasant was steaming hot so be careful! It had a light gamey flavour and the texture was not too tough to chew. Very flavourful indeed. The sausage could be served in a white bun (which I got) or with curry.   The fries were delicious but SUPER salty, and it might be a ruse to get you to try their beer. I had to buy water from a convenience store after. Anyway, they were a little burnt but otherwise very good and potatoey. My friend said she never saw such thick fries (and she's American) and was happily surprised. She couldn't finish her regular fries. I managed to finish all mine.   I would definitely come back again to try their other game sausages. And their fries, but I'll bring my own water next time."}
{"text":"Tasty stuff. We tried a bunch of sausages, and I was most impressed by the chorizo, elk, and kangaroo options. The tomato curry sauce made for a great dipping sauce.  Nice beer selection as well. While others went for the giant mug of german beer, I opted for a nice glass of a high percentaged Bellwood Brewery IPA.  All in all, a cool place but at $7 a sausage the bill can add up quickly if you go with a hungry group. Even with that in mind, when it comes to sausages and beer, this place is as good as it gets so earns the 5 star review."}
{"text":"2nd time here in a really long time and the food was quite good; their service could use a lift.  We got the wild boar and kangaroo game meats and a large duck fat fries to share.    Food: 3/5, let's start with the boat: it had a sweet taste and went well with sauerkraut and jalapeños.  The kangaroo was good too but the peppers and onion were too mushy and did not go too well with it.  The fries were good overall but could use a bit less toppings and more fries instead.  Service: 2/5, the workers here seem really upset in the face as no one is smiling or have the service feel to them.  There were no problems but I just got a weird vibe in both the face and tone.    Ambience: 3/5, pretty cool decor but I've never been a fan of backless seating.  Cool music though.  Price: 2.5/5, about $20ish per person for a fancy hotdog.  It's good but could be considered pricy for what it is."}
{"text":"We stopped in around 5pm on a Sunday in July and the place was pretty dead (for which we were glad, since we had been told that there is often a long wait to get one's food when this place is busy).     We ordered a couple of sausages (aka wursts) from the food cashier, and then went over to the bar and ordered a set of 6 tasters from their large selection of tasty craft beers.  My wife had the Wvrst Original --- a vegan sausage .  She was stoked that they had 3 vegan and 1 vegetarian sausages from which to choose from.  She enjoyed the one she got . I got the Calabrese --- pork and chili paste.  I think this was the best sausage I have ever had.   The bread and fixings on it were really nice as well.  Great beers, a cool atmosphere, nice servers, and an amazingly good Calabrese sausage was probably enough to get 5 stars.   Having 3 vegan options for my wife at a sausage place, which by all means could have chosen to have zero vegan options, ensured a 5-star rating. :)"}
{"text":"WVRST is the best sausage-fest in Toronto!   This bustling cafe offers a fine selection of meats in tube form, from your standard pork mixes to more exotic offerings like pheasant and kangaroo. My favorite is the wild boar, which is juicy and flavored with mushrooms; however, the traditional bratwurst (a mix of veal and pork, flavored with wine) is a close second. You can get your sausage served in a toasty roll, or do as the Germans do and enjoy it sliced and slathered in curry ketchup.   For those who have partaken in the awesomeness that is Hot Doug's in Chicago, the food is similar (down to the french fries cooked in all-that-is-holy duck fat -- which I highly recommend), but at Wvrst the decor is strictly King Street classy. The main drawback is that it's ridiculously noisy during peak times. You have to shout just to be heard, and chances are you'll leave with a hoarse voice. And service is s-l-o-o-o-w when it's busy. But the people that work there so friendly you'll forget about the 30 minute wait for your wiener (beer works wonders in making time pass quickly).   Despite the sore spots, Wvrst is still probably one of the best places to sample a sausage in the T-dot.  Note: Author takes no responsibility for any possible pun-itive damage to you, the reader, that was caused by the appearance of double entendre in this review, whether real or imagined."}
{"text":"Yes! What a cool spot!   The sausage selection is extremely cool (I'm literally drooling, thinking about them), the beer selection is also extremely cool (never been to a place that has a giant pipe cleaning schedule posted), the German communal dining feel is also cool, and this place is, well, you guessed it - very cool :)  I'm definitely coming back, to try other sausages (tried 2 different ones)."}
{"text":"Could be a 4 but overpriced everything runs rampant. Beer is way overpriced compared to other local establishments, but they do play great music and the wursts are good, altho some not great. Fun place when entertaining or celebrating with friends, but not a local spot for all the time."}
{"text":"A confirmed carnivore, I could do a lot worse but not much better than WVRST.  In the city where everything is a short walk away, we arrived just before dinner time on Friday, an opportune time to get my grub on during one of the happiest days and times of the week.  The selection of meat was broad and I settled on Wild Board, Currywurst style.  Duckfat fries and a salad were also ordered by my party.  Beer selection was wide and included ciders and  non-alcoholic beer.  Both the atmosphere and the food were enjoyable and were made for each other.  Although the interior furnishings lean towards minimalist and functional in the IKEA tradition, the atmosphere is pure German beer-hall.  In other words, boisterous, friendly and beer-fueled.    I had a great time and I'm glad I made a meal here one of the goals of my vacation."}
{"text":"Amazeballs.  Part German drinking hall, part glossy prison turned club this place is the Real Deal Holyfield.  It's only been open a few weeks, but there was a fair sized crowd and uber knowledgeable (and attractive) staff. The atmosphere is laid back yet cosmopolitan and the background music made me want to throw my beer on the floor and do a Hip Hop inspired polka across the communal tables.   A decent beer list and mountains of meaty goodness make this one sausage party you won't want to miss.  For condiment whores like myself, they have multiple types of Mustard and a plethora of house made dipping sauces, so go ahead and order a large helping of Duck Fat fries (my roommate and I almost clawed each other eyes out for the remaining scraps and I don't even like fries or duck).  And for those who prefer to not eat animals they have 2 really tasty meat free options too, so everyone's a winner, well except maybe the duck."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. A very relaxing spot to enjoy some microbrews with a friendly staff who will walk you through the order.  Fun dinner experience. Great for just hanging out or a chill date."}
{"text":"The gem of king st w, I'd say. Very cool place that reminds of a place where hipsters would go to gather. The lights remind me of distillery district and it's always cool to see communal tables.   Order first and then sit, and your order will magically appear. The food comes in old school trays. Extensive menu of different hot dogs you can get, with all kinds of interesting meat I'd didn't even know were legal to eat here. Kangaroo, elk, bison, rabbit etc. I'd love to go back and try more of the game sausages. I got the kangaroo with currywvrst (which isn't recommended, but I really wanted to try the tomato curry) - it doesn't come in a hot dog style, but more chopped up with a piece of country bread. Kangaroo definitely didn't taste like regular meat, but I don't know what to compare it to since I don't know how kangaroo is supposed to taste like. Very interesting though. Wvrst also has vegan options with black bean and tofu. We also ordered the duck fat fries with wasabi miso mayo and buttermilk ranch sauce, which were both delicious. The duck fat fries were pretty good but the duck fat taste is only evident in SOME of the fries.   As our meal ended, I decided to get the salted rosemary ice cream with sprinkled duck fat bits. Boyfriend tried to share with me but I made him order his own because there is no way I'm sharing. This truly blew my mind! Sweet and salty ice cream.. holy shit. There's nothing better. Also, the duck fat bits gave a nice salty and crunchy taste to it and it was definitely the perfect topping.   Deliciouso. I'd definitely come back!! Anyone 'game'? ;)"}
{"text":"Don't understand why this place has any popularity. To be honest, hot dogs off a street booth tastes way better!!"}
{"text":"I've been here on many occasions and it has never disappointed me.    I may have liked it less other times but that's because the menu is extensive enough for me to try something new almost every time so I blame that more on my palette.  Although this place is rather large and can probably seat over 100 people, it does tend to be busy on Friday nights and weekends.  As far as the sausages, which is what this place is known for, it's probably the best in town. I also love the bun they use which I believe they get from a place on College called Golden Wheat. After going here, I find it hard to buy anything from anywhere else even though it will be cheaper.  Their fries are really tasty as well especially those cooked in duck fat and they give you a pretty healthy portion for what you pay for.  If you're a microbrewery beer connoisseur, you're in for a treat as they have an extensive selection of draft and bottled varieties.   Going back to my visits... almost every time, I have introduced the place to someone and their views on sausage are changed forever (veggie version included)!  I'd suggest you give it a try if you haven't already..."}
{"text":"Just so much good!  Great food, Amazing and unique beer selection, super helpful and engaged staff, can't say enough good things!"}
{"text":"Great service! Perfect for newcomer! The duck fat fries is must-get! County cider co. And 5 paddles are great!"}
{"text":"If Wvrst has a failing, it's that their choice of doing one thing exceptionally well will inevitably result in them not being able to please everyone.  Listen, if you don't love sausage and beer, don't bother going.  I'm rather surprised to see so many people complaining about price, but there does seem to be a common theme.  Yes, some of their beers are pricy... but I can only assume it's because they're offering boring choices like PBR, Beau's and Stiegl* at higher price points to subsidise the reasonably priced microbrews and rare-ish imports they have on tap.  If you are ordering PBR, guess what:  you deserve to be charged entirely too much money for your ridiculous hipster affectation.    (*  I actually quite like Beau's, but it's a very safe choice amongst quite a few inspired, lesser-known beers that you should be trying instead.)  As for the sausages being overpriced, c'mon, really?  $6 is too much for a gourmet sausage?  When McDonald's is charging what now, $7 for a horrible not-burger with a side of nasty-fries?  A street-meat dog is what, $4? I am flabbergasted that I can get sausage of this quality in Toronto for a mere $6.    Anyway, enough of that, here's some thoughts:  *  Boerwors is good, wild boar is very good, and Bison is out-of-this-world good.  The spicing and flavour is well layered through the meat, with little bursts of awesome laced throughout.  *  The kangaroo I had was a dude -- it tasted of that powdered Italian seasoning your grandma uses... I can't help but wonder if it was a mistake, so I'm not judging them on the misfire.  This time.  *  French fries, as many have said, are excellent.  We had 'em \"dirty\".  Only complaint would be that the jalapeno was cut too chunky for our liking.  *  The cafeteria style ordering and table delivery is refreshing and fun.  The runners are incredibly helpful, knowledgeable, fast and, as a consequence, well deserving of your tips despite what Bryan G. absurdly suggests.  *  The bartenders are the best I've experienced thus far in Toronto.  Seamlessly efficient, on the ball, personable, genuine, generous and, in turn, appreciative.    *  The handshakes.  Yep.  The handshakes.  I received handshakes from a runner, both bartenders, the door man, and three random, friendly patrons.  I mistook the door man for a helpful patron, at first, and suspect he's likely much more than the title I've given him (I hope I am not doing him a disservice -- he was a true gentleman).  In an era of hands off, disaffected douche bags and barely-there service, I cannot express how much I appreciate the hands-on approach of Wvrst.  To say I loved Wvrst is an understatement.  They've provided one of the best experiences I've had out in this city.  Great sausage, amazing beer list (subsidised by the masses!), top-tier service, and genuine class.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love the salted maple rosemary ice cream. Not sure what was so special about the duck fat fries though..."}
{"text":"Wvrst was my choice for Birthday celebrations this year after reading all about it this summer from my fellow Yelpers Martin W, Matthew H, etc.   We had a large group and made a reservation which sort of worked, they printed out really cool signs and saved our seats for like 15 minutes then plucked the signs back up while half of the party was in line buying sausages and tried to squeeze other people in on top of our jackets.  And our friends that were a few minutes late... couldn't come since they were at capacity so they had to wish me happy birthday by phone.    The line took forever but the staff at front were super friendly and great with recommendations.  It took so long to bring our food I almost forgot we ordered, luckily I ate a pulled pork sandwich before I came.  The Kangaroo sausage was excellent and the duck fat fries were good (though I've had better incarnations).  The bar staff was also super friendly, smiling and wishing me a happy birthday.    I know it's the cool thing to do to screw over people who don't drink beer b/c it's a German beer place but I'm gluten intolerant and charging me $48 for 4 tiny juice glasses of shitty wine is not what I consider an acceptable move.    Aside from the tables there's a small open area that's kind of an impromptu dance area and it was a lot of fun meeting some interesting people mingling around."}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place! My friend came from NYC and wanted a place that was flexible enough for her friends to come at various times, and Wvrst was incredibly accommodating.   Food - Duck sausage with onions and peppers, dirty duck fat fries Drink - flight of beers (6 samples) and some more beer Ambiance - lively, a bit loud, fun.   I highly recommend the duck sausage with onions and peppers. It was soft and flavourful! The Dirty Duck Fat Fries were fries topped with onions and peppers (so, kinda the same as the sausage) but also with some jalapenos and sauce. It was good, but the flavours were the same as my own sausage so it didn't wow me. There were 3 types of mustards though, which was really fun.   The flight of beers was also fun - getting to try different ones, and then ordering your favourite if you're inclined. They also have ciders as a gluten-free option. In fact, this place is pretty good for non-gluten-eaters!"}
{"text":"Sausages, fries, and alcohol. You can never go wrong with that combination! Without a doubt the food is good here at Wvrst, but the finer details make this a solid three stars, as opposed to four.  The concept is great here; you order, get your number, and the food comes to you. Or you can go to the bar area for drinks. Table seating arrangement is communal seating, so it can get quite cozy with your neighbors. Menu is also very impressive with tons of sausages ranging from more unique meats like kangaroo to your standard selections. There are also tons of beer and alcohol to choose from, which is perfect with this kind of meal.   Went with normal selections in bratwurst and Oktoberfest sausages. One in curry style and the other in a bun, with an order of the infamous duck fat fries.   Sausages were nice and simple tasting. Not a whole lot going on, good amount of meat, not too fatty. Proportions are all right. Grilled well. I really enjoyed the currywvrst. Those of that are not familiar, should know that this is tomato based. So it's like ketchup with curry powder, it's not curry curry. It's sweet and tangy with the fragrant-ness of the curry. I had this in Germany and would say it's authentic. Fries are also great, but could be a tad more crispy and were dark tasting (due to being cooked in duck fat). It's like borderline burned in a totally OK way. Wvrst flavored dipping sauce didn't do much, it's like some kind of chipotle with other spices. Mayo is really strong here.  I really do like the environment here; it's like a cafeteria, it's open concept but the music is utterly being blasted overhead and everyone is talking so loud as a result - you can't even hold a conversation or eat in peace."}
{"text":"Love the German feel. The vegetarian options are really good. Really happy to find a place with some German culture. It is expensive, but totally worth the price. I had the black bean \"sausage,\" fries with honey dip, and a Munich Spaten. Very hap! Nice hours too"}
{"text":"I had a really hard time coming up with a star rating for this place. I think I'll just have to do a pros and cons list for this place:  Pros - great atmosphere - the music was fun, they threw in the odd German beer drinking song for good measure too - very good food - sausages were great and the sauce for the currywurst was the best I've had on this side of the Atlantic and almost as good as my favourite spot in Germany - friendly staff - despite being run off their feet, the staff were always friendly upbeat  Cons - prices - despite the quality of the food, I found it very difficult to pay nearly $40 for currywurst, fries and beer. Mind you, I'm used to having this in Germany where I would have paid less than 10 Euro for the exact same thing. - wait times - we waited nearly an hour to get and and then over 40 minutes for our food - noise - to go with just one other person is a bit silly. The music is so loud that you can't talk to the person on the other side of the table.  So, after all of this, I'm giving it 3 stars. I'd go back again with a group or when I get homesick for Germany, but I won't be a regular. It is, however, something fun and unique for Toronto and far less pretentious than Biermarkt across the street."}
{"text":"My favorite place we ate at in Toronto. Incredible food and even more incredible service.  In regards to the latter comment, our server, after learning we were first time visitors, took time to come to our table and write out a list of bars to visit and music venues to check out while we were in town. We all shared a sample of Jelly King, too. It was such a wonderful gesture!   For food, I got the Oktoberfest (with onions, Gouda, giardiniera) along with duck fat fries, and tons of dipping sauces (Jerk and Mushroom truffle were the best) It was such a great meal!  I will be coming back to Wvrst next time I visit! Guaranteed!!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars - I've been coming here since it opened and always liked it because it's the only German beer hall I know in the city and the beer selection is awesome! But I haven't eaten there in a very long time. Probably since it first opened. Last night I went and had the elk sausage on a bun ,  venison sausage on a bun and some pork one as a currywvrst..  And I must say,  it's the best sausage I've ever had. I didn't realize how good it was when I first tried it or it got way better since then. Elk and venison with sauerkraut and onions is legendary. Match that with a mad Tom IPA cask beer and you're in some version of German heaven. Would be 5 stars but all they do is sausage and fries so I feel 4.5 is better than any other place could ever get that only does sausage,  fries and beer."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim on Friday night and had a great time!  Very hopping place with a great atmosphere.   Order food and beer at the side and then go find a table, leaving your number on it. Beer can also be ordered from the bar as well while you wait for your food to be delivered.  I selected a chicken/artichoke sausage with jalepenos and sauerkraut on the side. My BF picked the spicy Calabrese sausage with jalepenos and sweet peppers. We also ordered a side of duck fat fries to share, choosing the maple rosemary dipping sauce.  The sausages came piping hot and were delicious! Loved the bottles of various mustards left at the tables to add to the sausages. Beer was cold and a great accompaniment to the food.  Very tasty, will return!"}
{"text":"Bratwurst in a bun: good. Bratwurst in currywurst: very good. Duck fat fries: awesome. Beer selection: good but would like to see more Germans on tap. Prices: reasonable. Complaints: none. Would visit again: yes."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more. Having lived in Germany I had really high hopes and expectation for a good bratwurst, fries and mayo.   The large open room and beer hall look with communal tables are great. However the I found the lighting in there way too dark for a casual place. They have lots of beer selection which is great and the food came pretty fast. It was a bit confusing the first time as their was no one to answer our questions and how the ordering system worked.  I had the simple curry wurst with a pork sausage with duck fat fries. I was disappointed, the portion felt very small for the price. The tomato curry sauce came in a small container on the side for dipping, and it just didn't feel and taste the same as the ones in Germany. The fries and mayo were ok, not amazing either, dare i say over-hyped. Maybe I've just been spoiled by the real deal."}
{"text":"Huge selection of game sausages for those that are adventurous and also a wide selection of regular ones for those not as bold. It was so hard to choose! I am definitely coming back to try more. We ended up getting the Kangaroo sausage and the Elk sausage with a side of dirty duck fat fries.   There were two options for sausages, either get it on a white bun with toppings or as a currywvrst. It was recommended that for game sausages to get it on a bun with your choice of toppings so that's what we did (we got sauerkraut and sauteed jalapenos). They were both really good but I enjoyed the kangaroo more. The elk sausage was a bit too soft for me. The dirty duck fat fries were also really good and would highly recommend. Definitely coming back to try the other game sausages they have!"}
{"text":"I love my lamb merguez. And when I can actually eat that at a restaurant without a pork casing, xtra points! Phenomenally simple sausage in a perfect bun with sauerkraut and sautéed onions- awesome. Dirty vege fries- there HAS to be crack in the sauce they put in the fries. Last time I enjoyed street meat ( as all hotdogs are to me) was never- will definately be regularly going back here. Clean foods, clean tables, simple menu, vast space. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I don't know if Wvrst is supposed to mean WORST or FIRST, but it should definitely be the latter. Totally worth making the trip. I know peeps here are going crazy on those duck fat fries, but the regular fries are crazy good. The chive dip is mind blowing. MIND BLOWING!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a red meat-free meal, so this might not be representative. I gave them the benefit of the doubt that others are better and gave 4 stars.  Chicken-turkey wurst was very good - moist, flavorful. Vegan original - not much flavor and very dry Vegan black bean - more flavorful but still dry  Cilantro-jalapeno sauce was good. Not a huge fan of the green peppercorn sauce, but it basically just tastes like green peppercorn. Truffle mushroom was flavorful but can hide the flavor of the actual food.   Dirty fries - the tomato curry sauce in it is amazing - wish there was more of that and just a bit less of the peppers/onions.  Overall, I like the idea, the variety, and most of the execution. It is difficult to have a moist vegan sausage, but they could do better there."}
{"text":"We got 2 sausages (Berkshire and guinea hen), cider, beer, regular salad and wild duck fries - the only thing not amazing was the salad. Highly recommended, probably one of the best sausages I ever had (if not the best).  Also, they have an almost infinite amont of beers and ciders."}
{"text":"Came to Toronto from DC and wanted some food and good beer late at night. This place is amazing. Ordered the Oktoberfest with sauerkraut and duck fat fries, hubs got boerewors with pretzels and everything was delicious!! Will recommend to friends who come to visit and we will be back when we are in Toronto again."}
{"text":"Slightly on the pricer side but worth the money. Since it was my first time here I went simple on my order and got the traditional Italian sausage, on a toasted fresh bun, with sweet sautéed onions and sautéed jalapeños. It came out to be around $9 and some change which is why I say it was kind of pricey since this is all I paid for only one sausage. But it was delicious! The sausage was full of flavor while the onions added a sweet touch and the jalapeños have it a kick. While I didn't order any fries my friends did and they tasted great too. If you get a sausage and some fries your guaranteed to be stuffed. The atmosphere is nice, almost like a backyard cookout but inside. Complimentary water also available at the front, coming out of a cute jug. I would come back, just wish the prices were lower."}
{"text":"Giving out 5 stars for best sausage in town.  i had the DUCK sausage maple and foie gras as menu said...the taste is very rich and I could really taste the foie gras."}
{"text":"Wvrst was pretty awesome. So fugging delicious, I would eat here 3x a week if I could. It was the best currywurst (actually the only currywurst) I've had outside of Europe. ($9) I wish I was hungrier so I could've gotten dessert.  I ordered a $17 stein. Which was excessive and was only available in some generic brand of beer which I obviously now forget because that was over a litre of beer ago. They've got long tables and it looks like a beer hall, good beer selections, lots of ciders, great food and sides. Would definitely recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from friends.  Wvrst specializes on offering sausages and beer.  The space is cafeteria-style.  When you walk in, it's a very loud and casual environment.  You have to line up to order, but they give you a number and bring you your food.  If you don't know what you want to drink, go up to the bar.  The bartenders are so friendly and offer samples and suggestions.  The sausages are good to great, as some are hit and miss.  I had the rabbit and Kangaroo - both which are good.  My favourite toppings are sauteed onions and peppers.  The duck fat fries are good, but not amazing.  If you get large, you can share with a couple of friends, as the helping is more than enough.  The currywvrst is also recommended.  Sausages are around the $10 and have a large beer list that include organic and local options.  Here's the food menu: http://wvrst.com/wvrst-food-menu.pdf"}
{"text":"It was super bumpin' even on a Wednesday night. I went to the bar and grabbed a couple of beers and a flight of ciders (6 for $14). The bartenders were attentive and kind, the venue is open concept so it does get loud but not as.. loud? If that makes any sense. The string light and big bench tables adds a nice patio-esque ambience and the duck fries are to die for! Oh, and you can also sample any beer/cider on tap which is great. Would return again to try the hotdogs next!"}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Lunch Specialty: German-style Sausage Hall Menu items: Bison, Wild Boar and Venison Sausages with Duck Fat Fries  Who is in for a sausage party? Well, the kind of party that involves food, that is. Before we begin, let me educate you on the pronunciation of this place - read \"Verst\". And its exact English translation is non other than sausage (figures). This recently opened spot in the heart of King West has been successfully luring in lunch crowds. With its sausage hall concept, breadth of sausage styles and flavours and an impressive local and imported beer menu; Wvrst has quickly become a favourite in the area and the Friday lunch go-to place for most of us.  Their dedication to the core product, sausages; its one to admire. All sausages are freshly made on the premises and cooked when ordered. When you arrive at Wvrst, you right away notice a large line up of people (mostly men...I did say it was a sausage party) staring at the menu, asking the staff for advice and at times drinking beer while waiting in line. Because this is a sausage hall, once your food is ordered, you are given a number which then lets the waiters know which table to bring the food to. One thing you will notice is that because the line-ups are long, the waiters are extremely diligent in cleaning up the tables, so don't feel like they are rushing you, they are just doing their job and are very pleasant.  Now, lets talk about the product. From the list, my favourite is the Venison style sausage. Given that its flavour is more on the smokey, nutty and hearty side, it makes it a great pairing with just about any topping. You can choose 2 out of 4 toppings - Caramelized Onions, Sauerkraut, Sweet Peppers and Sautéed Jalapeños. The roll used to wrap these juicy meats around is something worth mentioning, being on the rather soft side, this roll is lightly sweet with a hint of sourdough style bread, a great choice. Note to reader: you can also order a whole wheat roll and choice of veggie or chicken sausage options.  Another one of Wvrst's hits is their Duck Fat Fries. Fried in duck fat as opposed to regular oil, the fries tend to be softer and buttery, while maintaining a great consistency on the surface. How this is done? A two step frying process. Double-dipping is what I would name this frying method. The outcome? Buttery and flavourful french fries.  But the goodness does not end here, on top of having great tasting fries, Wvrst offers you a selection of dipping sauces. My favourite, and one that I can not live without, the Mojito sauce. Dip your fries in it or add it to your sausage party, either way you in are in for a heck of a tasty treat.  Until next time Foodies!  Buen Provecho, Viviana."}
{"text":"I found out about this place on Anthony Bourdain's - The Layover. The idea of a german sausage hall really intrigued me and when I heard about the fries cooked in duck fat it was a slam dunk that I had to go. Now basically any time i'm in that area of Toronto, i MUST go there. The different types of sausage with amazing flavor profiles is wicked, plus they have a great selection of beers on tap from imports, to craft beers from all across the country. But omg the duck fat fries and the dips that you can get with it..... its making me hungry just TYPING about it, easily my favourite place to eat in the city, hands down. IF you haven't gone there.... you MUST."}
{"text":"I thought that Toronto sausage vending carts were the best.  What could be better?  Easy, Wvrst is better.  The long tables and rustic interior means this is no poser place--its the place to get a serious protein pipe, and the sides to match.  I had to spend a bit of time assessing the menu.  So many good choices, and only one lunch today.  I went for the Chorizo, smothered in carmelized onions and sauerkraut.  Instead of the typical soft bun, this sausage is served in a bun with a great chew, partly slotted so the sausage and toppings stay inside.  The onions and sauerkraut were a tough choice since there is a variety of toppings available,  I was tempted to add the grilled jalapeños as well, but you gotta stop somewhere.  Stop at Wvrst!"}
{"text":"Pretty chill vibe, love the design of the restaurant. There are communal tables, so you might have to sit next to people you don't know. But if that's okay with you, then great! I also arrived when the restaurant just opened for the day, so not sure how busy it can get during peak hours.  Very very interesting selection of food you can choose from. If you're one to explore different kinds of food, then this is a great place to start. I'm not one to explore, so I played it safe and got the Italian and Danger Dog.   The quality of the food was a bit above average. Maybe it's not something you will crave and dream about a couple days later, but it was tasty and definitely satisfied my hunger. What I did enjoy was the soft service ice cream. We got the salted maple rosemary soft serve and it was very flavorful and very hard to not stop eating.   Overall, would recommend if you're in the area. If you're one to try different and interesting types of food, then I would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Love the casual atmosphere and the unique food. I did not try the craft beer but enjoyed the duck fries,and had a bite of the kangaroo,bison and elk! Bison was my favorite and I loved the maple rosemary dipping sauce!! I would def return and try some more stuff!! If you get a chance to check out the amazing bakery underneath its a wonderful combo!"}
{"text":"If you like sausage then this place is for you! Very exotic different sausages. I got the Kangaroo sausage. You can pick from a variety of sausages and add your normal toppings for a sausage (onions, peppers, jalapeños). (How many times can someone say sausage in a 4 sentences.) This is a great lunch spot or snack place. Don't go here for dinner, you won't be filled up. They have a solid selection of craft beers. Decent place overall, would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"I ordered: Duck fat fries, Kangaroo sausage, **Salted Maple Rosemary Ice Cream** (plz get this)  (0.5/1) Price vs portion  (2/2) Taste + food presentation Salted Maple Rosemary Ice Cream - SO GOOOD - Creamy, unique taste  Duck fat fries - Well-cooked, seasoned, firm-texture fries - Spicy veggies topping - Not mind-blowing but probably as good as fries can get  Kangaroo sausage - Not mind-blowing but better than average sausage - Go very well with the variety of sauces - Good with fries  - Food served on clean meta land wooden trays  (1/1)  ambiance + customer service - Awesome looking beer hall - Highly aesthetic and very clean for a bar setting - Friendly waiters  (0.5/1) Wow! - everything come together for a nice food experience ~ not \"wow\" enough for full point"}
{"text":"Really good. Beer selection was great and the options for sausage / toppings is very unique."}
{"text":"Super fun place to hang out with friends, afterwork get together or fun lunch spot. Food is great!! Lots of places to sit and chat and drink!!"}
{"text":"Taps are awesome. Sat at a communal table and hated it. People were rather rude about it and that comes with the neighbourhood. I obviously went back but that doesn't mean that I enjoyed the experience enough."}
{"text":"I dig the concept of this place. It's basically a big, open space on King West with big tables, big beer steins, and big hotdogs that can be as fancy as you want it to be. The food, I'll say, is only decent though.  Wvrst is usually jam-packed with people on weekends and tends to be on the very loud side of the noise spectrum. It has a European ambience, which is something that you don't see every day in Toronto.  I'd give it a try with your good friends and see where the night takes you afterwards!"}
{"text":"If you want to try some exotic game (I had kangaroo) and drink some good brews (I had a smoky-flavoured churck-key) then this is your spot!"}
{"text":"This is my first time going to a place that mainly sells sausage and beer, it was really interesting getting to try exotic meat.   I ordered kangaroo sausage and duck(foie gras) sausage. Kangaroo meat sort of tasted like chicken sausage, the duck sausage taste interesting, it wasn't tender, it was soft and flavorful. My bf ordered a beer, he said it tasted pretty good.   It took awhile for us to get our food, and by the time we got it, the line was down the store. Their seating area is like a cafeteria, so u might have to share tables with strangers at a busy time.   Overall pretty interesting experience, would want to try their duck fries next time!"}
{"text":"Ye olde bier and sausage hall. That pretty much sums it up. Things I like about this place include the duck fat fries, the oversized glasses of beer and the sausages (hotdogs) are pretty damn fine. What I will say is that it can be a pain in the ass to get in there, long line ups and they only hold your reservation for a limited time and if one of your party are late they just have to wait in line and get in when there is room. Room = their capacity, not whether there is room in the venue. Often there will be loads of room just not compared to the capcity. Depending on the line waiting could be 30-60min which sucks. Worth a visit just probably not great for large groups unless youre booking it all out all night."}
{"text":"Holy sweet baby jesus.  What is this place? First you have some of the best craft beer known to man second you have a metric sh*t ton of meat? INCREDIBLE. I visited here with a very good friend, we were swiftly lost in the amazing bouquet and aura of the building, it was essentially Disney but with meat and beer. So it was basically my dads house, but with way more love. We cherished our time at WRVST. After a few bites of my sausage I decided that this was it, I started to remove the cyanide capsule from my tooth to end it all, I could finally die happy. The next thing that happened was nothing short of amazing, duck fat fries were delivered to our table and the ghost of the duck whose fat it came from was flying around my head, he stopped on my shoulder and whispered into my ear. That magic duck told me the meaning of life. I promptly started to cry, tears streaming down my face I devoured those duck fat fries in honor to my new web-footed god.   I will never forget you Antonio the Duck, I love you. Onionringlover69"}
{"text":"A modern day beer hall in Toronto. It a cafeteria style restaurant, with some of the most bad ass sausage selection. I would definitely say to get the Guinea Fowl, Kangaroo and the Bratwurst Currywurst. They're packed full of flavour and where else are you going to eat a Kangaroo in Toronto?   They have a great beer selection on tap and whisky on tap. Yes, Whisky on tap! I'll looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"German sausage and beer hall. It's a solid spot for a carnivore, with a large selection of different sausages, some gamier than others. They have communal style tables, so it might be a bit overwhelming and intimidating for some folks. You order at the counter, and they bring over your drinks and food after a while. You get a choice of 2 toppings and I loved their sauerkraut. Currywurst style is interesting, but I preferred the hotdog style a little more mainly because of the sauerkraut. We got there at 11:30pm, but the place was still half-full and still bustling. Solid price point for a slightly different meal, super interesting and definitely well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night and was surprised and it wasn't more busy.  Had a tough time picking what to order, there were so many options! I ended up getting the elk currywurst. Caution : I don't recommend getting the game meats currywurst style. The menu warns everyone against it but I thought I would try to be daring #regrets.  I had the hot dog during my previous visit and thought it was much better ratio of carbs and meat. (FYI- Got the kangaroo hot dog last time and liked it a lot more).  The maple rosemary with duck bits ice cream is a must try! Really enjoyed the contrast of the creamy and crunchy texture, the cold ice cream and the warm fries bits and the sweet and herby flavor. I would honestly come back just for this.   Ambiance wise, I loved the big red wall and the coat hangers are a nice touch especially in the winter.  You have to get up and line up near the front to order. The lined moved quite slow but the food came out fast."}
{"text":"Tons of beers on tap, and an amazing variety of sausages. Definitely going back to try more!"}
{"text":"I travel to Toronto about once a month for work and stay in the Entertainment District. I've been meaning to write this review for awhile, because WVRST is one of the best places I've discovered in the area. I've probably been here 20 times. Why do I come back? The best sausage I may have ever had (mind you I live in the sausage capital of N America, Chicago).   Try the Kranjska with grilled onions and jalapeños and add the deli mustard. The crunchy bun along with the smoky sausage and the savory sweet/hot onions, peppers and mustard make for a fantastic combo. The fries are great too-get the tomato curry if you like spice (which clearly I do). The staff is great, especially Pat, who is stereotypically Canadian nice and super knowledgeable about local Canadian craft beer.   This is one of the three or four places I MUST visit when I'm in town. Did I mention that the design/decor is, cool, contemporary, and communal?  The WVRST is the best."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband who is German, from Munich. A real Bavarian. Expectations were high so perhaps we were already set up for a mixed experience.   As far as the place itself goes, it gets the German beer hall vibe down pact. The long communal tables easily lends itself to easy mingling with whoever is sharing the table with you. Two thumbs up, even from the Bavarian.   The beer selection is extensive. Like huge with a good selection of craft beers and German imported beer as well. My husband was excited to order a Schneider Weiss beer which looked great but unfortunately had a bitter aftertaste. It kind of tasted like you could taste the keg? It was weird. Maybe the lines got mixed up or weren't  cleaned properly? I don't know, but it definitely had a weird metal like after taste. I ordered a flight which I really enjoyed. My favourite beer was the Weiheinstephaner. I think it is one of the best beers I have ever had.   For food, I had the pheasant sausage and he had the bratwurst, currywurst style. They were ok. Nothing earth shattering but pretty ok. The duck fat fries were also ok.   Overall, it wasn't bad. It's an interesting experience and I would go back again.   My husband on the other hand was disappointed with his beer and not impressed with the food. He said the sausages from the street vendors are more flavourful and way cheaper. He has a point and how can you argue with a Bavarian about beer and sausages?   Oh well. I guess we won't be coming back here for date night but I will for sure come back again with friends."}
{"text":"[BOTTOM LINE] I've never felt so overwhelmed by so many sausage options (perhaps in some Berlin restaurants, so that's 100% a compliment to Wvrst here). You will absolutely find something you love here -- and if you hate sausage, there are some killer duck fat fries.  [THE SPACE] Great cafeteria/beer garden vibe that's excellent for large groups and families alike. There are a series of high and low tables throughout the place, with a bar on either side (although one of the bars was closed when we were eating there for lunch). There's also a little nook for bigger parties -- not sure if you had to reserve that spot.   [THE FOOD] /MEAT/ There are so many sausages. They're broken up into types: game (FOWL! ELK! RABBIT!), traditional (PORK! BEEF! VEAL!), vegetarian/vegan (CHICKPEA! LENTIL!), poultry (CHICKEN! TURKEY!), and you can get it on a toasted bun or as currywurst (sliced, with bread and tomato curry ketchup).   For 2 people, we got two sausages as currywurst -- you can double the portions, if you're feeling extra peckish. Also, the bread that comes with it is AMAZING. We asked for more just to sop up the sauce.  /FRIES/ Get the large duck fat fries -- you won't regret it. They're piping hot, so juicy and fatty, and come with your selection of dipping sauces (we went for the chive and roasted garlic aioli -- delicious, and also made my breath stink with happiness).  /PICKLED/ We got a platter of pickled veggies -- I wish they sold them in two (they either come in 1, 3, or 6). I liked the carrots and daikon a lot, which were super sour and spicy. If you're not that hungry, I'd pass on this though.  /SALAD/ In a fit of guilt I also ordered a small salad...which was delicious, fresh, and enormous, even for a regular.   Overall, a great place for both small and big meals. Come here at any time of the day, because there's never a wrong time for sausage and fries."}
{"text":"Was visiting Toronto for the week, and this was the only place that my friend insisted we go. The one-two punch of sausage and beer is always effective, but Wvrst was a model archetype. A nice variety of sausages (including a few I haven't had before, like kangaroo and rabbit), good beer selection, and an ambiance evoking some cross between a German beer hall and a trendy hipster bar.  Only minor knock: the french fries. Next time, I'd skip the fries and instead double up on sausage."}
{"text":"Wvrst is the best! Best is the WVRST!  Wvrst is what you get when you smash together a German beer hall with young King Street West yuppie condo chic: a large casually hip sausage cafeteria lined with rows of communal tables, often populated every night by foodies and work-hard-play-hard young professionals. Order food at the cashier, take your assigned number to where you want to sit, enjoy and repeat. You'll get the hang of it quickly enough.  And of course cannot forget about the bar. You want beer? They got some! Lots and lots of them! More kinds of beer than I have fingers and toes times three! A lot of craft brews from around here and elsewhere, rare beers and stuff from all over the world. Beer bière bier! Pricey, sure. But their impressively overloaded array of taps on the wall makes Wvrst one of the most interesting bars I have ever seen.  (Not into alcohol? Okay, there's complementary self-serve water at the other end of the cashier counter. Good to know.)  By the way, you hungry? Of course you are. Question is, are you hungry for sausage? Mmm, sausage...  Their menu is a sausage fest in itself, because that's what it's all about here. There are some veggie sausage options ($7), but the most intriguing is their game meats offerings. Whose urban curiosity isn't tickled by such choices like bison, rabbit, kangaroo and wild boar, all it should be noted at $9. All of them comes prepared with special ingredients. Bison with blueberries and maple syrup is an unexplainable wonder. The kangaroo is more on the spicy side than gamey. Nonetheless an interesting choice if you're game for telling your friends you ate kangaroo--unless I suppose you are an Aussie fan who is witnessing your team get slaughtered in World Cup football (Go Deutschland!).  As is their currywurst, their dirty duck fat fries is a must-try. It is a colossal mess of spicy peppers, onions and sauces piled on top of fries that have been blessed by a vat of duck fat, and it will own your mouthwatering mouth with no mercy. If jalapenos aren't your thing, their non-spicy \"clean\" duck fat fries is just as merciless. The only thing that is missing is some cheese curds, as honestly I think they should start serving this stuff in poutine form.  Food comes rather quick, and service is never something to complain about. The busyness however is. If you are like me and don't like thick crowds, lineups and nightclub-like methods of entry (when it's packed, there's a doorman to control access), come in before the evening gets warm and you won't have put up with any of that. The early afternoon period is a great time to have a peaceful family meal here, or get some stuff done on a laptop, or even have a whole row of tables to yourself. For those more in a party mood, Wvrst hosts regular themed nights, and the projector goes on to beam in Leafs games or big international sporting tournaments.   What's the Wvrst that can happen in this lovely trendy, unpretentious downtown place?   {TTC: nehmen den Straßenbahn 504 bis Portland(ia) Street.}"}
{"text":"One of my goto places on King/Bath area when Im craving gourmet sausages and good Euro beer. Great place, definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review without having eaten anything. There seems to be no table service here. Customers line up to order, instead of enjoying the company of their friends at a table. Doing a job people are normally paid to do. (I've had time to download the Yelp app and write this review in the time I've spent in line.) It's loud, hot, crowded and confusing in here. You order food and drinks yourself from two separate bars. This is the most aggressively unpleasant restaurant experience I've ever had. 2 stars on the assumption that the food is good, because how else could this clusterfvck still be in business if it weren't."}
{"text":"This is my second review of Wvrst. The first visit I wasn't really impressed but this time!!! Yum! I got the bratwurst sausage with duck fat fries. The combination of both is drool worthy.  I also tried boylan's ginger ale for the first time and I was impressed. I've tried other boylan's flavours before but I think I have a new fav. The service is a bit slower than I expected but then again as one of my friends say, it's better for it to take longer than to get food poisoning lol. The food here really is delicious, it's not cheap but if you're looking for quality sausages you've come to the right place.  I'll definitely visit again. A+"}
{"text":"Wvrst is pretty much Toronto version of Wurstküche in Los Angeles - a German bar with an exotic selection of sausages and banquet style tables. What do I mean by \"exotic\"? Guineafowl, pheasant, duck, venison, merguez, bison, wild boar, elk, rabbit, and kangaroo (you heard it right - Kangaskhan ... I mean kingaroo). There are also gluten-free, vegan, and traditional sausages available. To order, you first select a meat and follow by either picking two toppings on a toasted bun (sweet sauteed onions, sauerkraut, sauteed jalapenos, sweet peppers, or giardiniera - extra CAD $2.25) OR selecting the currywurst style (sliced sausage served with country bread and tomato curry sauce). Once you place your order, just grab your number and the staff will come find your table.  Parking: I don't really want to know how much I have paid for public parking during my stay in Toronto ... I had to pay CAD $15 (Friday and Saturday from 6 PM to 6 AM) at the Indigo parking lot (75 Portland Street M5V 2M9 Toronto Ontario CA) and it is just a block away from the bar.  ***  Kangaroo (fine herbs; sweet pepper and jalapeno on a toasted bun, CAD $9.75): Sausage tasted somewhat plain, but at least I like kangaroo better than veal.  ***  Overall a 3.5-star, but bump up to 4-star due to the fun and socializing vibes."}
{"text":"L'endroit est canon : une espèce de loft de 300m2 décoré avec gout et style, un bijoux. Le concept est assez simple : on y sert des hot dog, mais on propose 30 saucisses différentes  (dont deux végé).  Les frites sont excellentes.  De nombreuses bières au choix.  Et en plus pas très cher pour un endroit trendy dans Toronto, c'est plutot cool!"}
{"text":"Wvrst is a pretty interesting spot to grab a bit and chill with your friends.  Located on King W, this restaurant does a good time like few can.  Now of course all the jokes and puns can be made about it being a sausage fest..and well it's true..lol.  Everywhere you look it's sausage time!  The menu is broken up into parts - choose your meat (duck, bison, pheasant, elk, kangaroo, rabbit, there is even vegetarian/vegan options etc) and then choose your side if you want.  Drinks are ordered at the bar to the side, the meal is ordered at the back of the restaurant.  I decided to try the elk - but done currywurst style.  I'm not a big fan of bread/buns so this was a great option for me.  You get your sausage (minus bun) and then some curry on the side to eat it with.  The curry is more tomato based than curry based but still quite good.   The elk itself was beautifully cooked - juicy and light on flavor (meaning the taste of the meat shone through nicely - it didn't feel heavy at all).  As a side my friend and I shared the duck fat fries (get the small order - it's still a good size portion).  It comes with a sauce on it and red peppers on it.  Because of the toppings/sauce the fries ended up being quite soggy.  This was the disappointment of the meal.  While they sound good I don't think I would order this again.  The service was good - order at the back, they give you a number to put on the table and bring your food when ready.   The space is bigger than it seems - long communal tables in the middle and one large table in front and of course seats at the bar.  I'll definitely return to get my sausage on again."}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars bordering on 5, Wvrst is a new addition to the King west lineup and thank god we finally have a place like this in Toronto!  Toronto is infamously known for it's lack of good German food and while I would err on calling this place \"German\", Wvrst is certainly adding a bit more to Toronto's vocabulary. Dressed with long communal tables, this hall of sorts can fit a crap ton of people and the way the sound echo's I can imagine will be thunderous come Oktoberfest.   Wvrst serves essentially one thing... and that is sausage. Glorious sausage (no homo - and not that there's anything wrong with that). I've given a go at both their \"normal\" sausages and their currywvrst and if you're not having the currywvrst here you're wasting your time. The regular sausages are no different than many of the street sausages you can get but get the \"game\" sausages on currwvrst and this plain ol' sausage just becomes magical!  From duck to rabbit to guinnea fowl, Wvrst has quite the interesting selection and what turns it up the notch is the rather authentic Belgian fries (fried in duck fat - yes please!). The dipping sauces (especially the Wvrst sauce) are amazing as well.  And what of the price? Very reasonable! ~$8-9 for a sausage and $3-4 for a healthy portion of fries, you cannot go wrong with a quick meal here. The only thing that disappointed me was the rather high price of beer here. For a rather quick meal and drinking hall that Wvrst seems to be, the $8 Tecate type beers was a bit steep.   But I'll keep coming back... *drool* Oh yes I will"}
{"text":"Wvrst is a big sausage beer cafeteria. It's casual and the food and drink are great. You place your order up at the front, take a seat (all communal), and wait for your order to be delivered to you. There's also a separate bar if you want to order more booze.   I wasn't daring enough to order the kangaroo sausage so I went with the duck sausage on a bun. The duck sausage was flavorful and the bun was fluffy and slightly toasted. You can add two toppings for free (additional toppings come with a charge) and I choose the sautéed bell peppers and the onions. The sautéed onions were almost like a jam which I felt I could top on anything.   I also had an order of the dirty duck fries = Fries fried in duck fat, topped with sautéed bell peppers, jalapeños and more of those amazing onions, and Wvrst special sauce which was spicy and had hints of curry flavor. I could definitely taste the richness in the fries from then duck fat."}
{"text":"I'm solidly in the 2.5 stars category on this place, but Yelp doesn't seem to allow that.  I just don't get the appeal of Wvrst. I like sausage, I like beer, it should be a match made in heaven! I went once on a Monday where there was no draught beer, which was really disappointing - Wvrst, you have a social media profile. I follow you. Why don't you tweet that there's no draught to people (like me) who make decisions based on the quality of the beer offerings? Monday is discount beer night, the people deserve to know.  The sausage was overcooked a bit and while the fries were good, they weren't awesome. The dipping sauces were fun to try but none really stuck out to me. We had to ask repeatedly for sausage condiments because we didn't want to snag them from another group and make things awkward - isn't that why the servers are there?  The service was reasonable aside from the condiments, but I found it a bit slow to order at the cash. I'm glad I've never come here on a really busy night because I think I would turn around and leave. I hate long lines.  Wvrst was featured on \"Suits,\" though, which makes it a win for fans of the show!"}
{"text":"Don't think of this as a hot dog restaurant... think of it as an establishment with one of a kind meats that you may not be able to find elsewhere, in a sausage casing, served in a hot dog bun, with the option of jalapenos, peppers and sauerkraut at no charge!  I don't always get to see my good friend who's away at school so when he decided to meet me for lunch, I wanted to go somewhere unique. Thinking that this place had CROCODILE, I mispoke and actually meant kangaroo. Thinking to half splurge on one exotic meat, I was told why not to go all out - how often would you come back?  I have to agree to that one.  I was sooo surprised at how big the space is - restaurants nowadays have such narrow dining areas that I felt like 2 restaurants can fit into this space.  There are long communal picnic tables seating... a lot. and about 4 - 5 high top wooden tables, sitting another 8 - 10 each.   The way it works is that you put your order in at the front, they give you a number, and you wait. if a huge line up comes in at once, the empty space would make a long queue. Luckily, we had no wait.  Our choice of meat: 1. PHEASANT 2. KANGAROO with all the fixings.. and a small fries with one dipping sauce - we chose the house WVRST - which is similar to a spicy chipotle mayo. There is a huge case showing the different sausages available for the day, so if you are not convinced by the menu, just go see the real thing for yourself.  Our HDs were cut in half so we could each try a bit of the interesting meats. The pheasant was very flavourful with the herbs that were included. It definitely tasted different, but I am not sure if it lived up to the actual bird as I've never tasted it before. None the less, I'm glad I tried it. The kangaroo was a little tougher, more gamey, but also very tasty. It got super spicy at the end but it was evident that each sausage had it's interesting tastes and textures. I hate it when I'm told that I'm eating two different things, but they both either taste exactly the same, or tastes like chicken!  The ladies came by to make sure we were enjoying our meal, which is nice because it is essentially like a gourmet cafeteria. If it wasn't so cold or I wasn't working, I would've ordered a pitcher of beer like everyone else. Seems like they have some good alcohol selections (and non alcoholic sodas too).  This place is truly an experience... and at $9 a gourmet hot dog, it's worth trying ONCE. I have to say Japa Dog is still the most amazing tasting hot dog experience ever, but if you like things like fowl, boar, rabbit, and so on, then drop in."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken/turkey sausage on a bun. You can really taste the quality of their meat and ingredients. Great meal and service overall."}
{"text":"This has always been my go to place for quick bite. I love the atmosphere , it's very casual. Great for coming with friends to grab a drink and some snacks. It's usually quite crowded on weekends and it is hard to find a seat after placing your order.   My favorites are the game sausages. Plus i love the duck fat fries with the wrvst dipping sauce. Service tends to be slow when it is busy so do expect a wait to get your food. Overall it's always a good time at wrvst and I highly recommend to those who never been here."}
{"text":"Great sausages and some good sides. Most recently I had the bison with a side of sauerkraut and fries. The sausage was very good and the sauerkraut tasty. Fries are average. If you get a sausage that goes well with mustard, their mustard is very tasty.   This place also has a good setup in terms of beer and this definitely makes it a good place for German food in a city that is a bit lacking in this department. Overall a great place to go for the first time, and a good place to come back to, especially late night when you feel like getting some good food in before a night out."}
{"text":"I don't know how to say this without feeling dirty, but I'm usually not much of a sausage girl. Thus I entered this establishment with slight hesitation. However I was pleasantly surprised not only by the diverse offerings, which included a number of vegan options, but also by the decor. It has a true Oktoberfest vibe meshed with cafeteria seating and a unique but practical ordering system.   I opted for the turkey/chicken with sautéed onions, sweet peppers and garlic aioli. Omg those sautéed onions were the bomb, a term I swear I don't use lightly. The bun was also stupidly good and the sausage itself was lean and tasty. This place is right up my alley: hormone free, no filler, only good stuff. A great option for people who like to know what they're eating.     A 4 for being way more awesome than I had imagined. I can't wait to bring my bf here!"}
{"text":"I'm impressed with the variety of dogs and beer... The Dirty Duck Fries were delicious and quite the serving... you can probably share them...  I had the wild boar, tea infused sausage with sautéed onions and sauerkraut... delicious... can't wait to go back and try the next one on the list... :) The flight beer (6 samplers) was ok... next time i'll probably pick one of the pints instead... i'm not much of a beer guy so i can't tell you if it was good but i wasn't crazy about it... but i think it's a good value..."}
{"text":"I think I am in love! I had the bratwurst  sausage and duck fat fries with the chipotle dipping sauce. It was absolutely satisfying - this is a sausage I can eat every day!  Everyone in my table loved their food too. One girl commented that the regular fries were saltier than the duck fat fries - so something to consider when ordering.  In terms of variety of sausages, they have vegan, traditional, poultry and game! Next time I want to try a game one but I have no clue what elk/bison/rabbit/kangaroo/etc would taste like! It will doubtlessly be a fun adventure choosing new meat.  The place has long communal tables - similar to what a beer hall must look like. It some ways, it reminded me of the lobster suppers of PEI. Leave your inhibitions at home and smile to the stranger sitting next to you!"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this place for a dinner with a small group. I had my birthday party there and it was a bit much for them to handle. BUT I emailed afterwards to let them know and the manage promptly called me, and had me back for a complimentary dinner. The food and service were excellent - consider it all forgiven! It gets pretty busy on a weekend or late at night - it becomes more of a bar than a restaurant. But if you go during the week or early enough in the evening on a weekend - you'll have a great time!"}
{"text":"Pros:  Variety Quality meat  Sauces  DUCK FRIES are the best (not real duck, just potato) Lots of seating  Social place, very fun  Great for small birthday badges  Turkey sausage the best  Exotic choices Fun Staff Beer  Apple cider - the amber coloured one (sorry can't remember name)  The beer sampler (worth trying)  Cons:  Loud at times Very exciting  Exotic choices (intimidating) NOT vegan or vegetarian recommend unless eating fries. They may have veggie sausage but...  kangaroo sausage... made me sick  Busy at night Wait In line to order  Summary: A great place to get together with friends and enjoy beer + a couple sausages. The duck fries, a beer, plus 2 sausages was enough to fill my partner's stomach who can eat way more than me. I have gone here 2-3 times and imagine myself going at least 2 more times this year."}
{"text":"An interesting place. With community tables, a very large selection of sausages, and a good selection of beer on tap (I've been told all barmen are trained in the best way to pour each beer, as well as which glasses to use), this place is a nice gem in Toronto. Luckily a local took me there as I wouldn't have noticed the place from the outside. The night we were there it wasn't too full - but I've been told it can get very popular over the weekends.  If you don't mind sharing your table and want to adventure your tastebuds with some kangaroo sausage and some local craft beer, I'd definitely recommend heading over!"}
{"text":"Enough sausage to fill any man...uh...  Anyways, Wvrst is a cool bar/restaurant that serves up good libations with a whole menu filled with sausage. And not just any normal brats either. They have a variety of game meats, which is what drew me in. Where else can you eat kangaroo, venison, or duck sausage??  Coming with a friend of mine, she had no idea what this place entailed. So I surprised her with some kangaroo sausage in a bun with grilled onions, and also tried the regular bratwurst, currywurst style. You have the option of sticking your sausage into a warm toasted bun, or to have it served currywurst style which is just your sausage of choice cut up and served with sliced country bread and a tomato curry sauce.   The kangaroo sausage is something I've never dreamed about eating. But seeing as how I wouldn't mind eating every animal possible (maybe not humans...maybe), I knew I had to give it a shot. The meat itself is rather tough but not gamey in flavor at all. Similar to pork in taste and texture and honesty, probably couldn't tell the difference between them. Being encased in sausage may not be the real way to encapsulate that true \"kangaroo flavor\", but it was still good with the bite of the slightly grilled onions on a toasted bun.   The bratwurst, served currywurst style, was pretty good. The brat had a sharp bite to it and I loved the curry sauce. Rich tomato-y taste with a thick texture. I'm not sure why they call it curry because I could not taste any hint of curry (coriander, cumin, or anything of that sort). Portion was small though, and it really leaves you wanting more, especially for the $8 price tag that it garners.  Overall, it's a good place to come for beers and sausage, but if you were as hungry as we were, it wasn't the right place to grab dinner. You'll have to spend a lot in order to get full, but if you're looking to sample some odd grub at a place that looks like a giant indoor picnic hall, you need to stop by here."}
{"text":"The place is one of my favourite bars in Toronto.  Wvrst is a bavarian style pub with long bench tables, tons of beer and a large selection of sausages that is definitely going to please the different preferences in your group of friends.  The sausages come in bun and currywvrst format.  I've never ordered the currywvrst, but it's supposed to be a plate of sausage covered in a curry sauce.  In terms of sausages, they have a ton.  Everything from your classic bratwursts and chorizo sausages to some different ones like boar and kangaroo.  It takes a couple trips back to Wvrst to actually try them all but it makes it easier if you decide to share.  I personally really like the boar sausage as well as the classic bratwurst. You can't really go wrong with these.  I've found that most of the fowl sausage a little dry, but I did like some of the other game sausages like the elk and the kangaroo.  In terms of beer, they have a bunch of german beers on tap as well as a bunch in bottles from around the world.  True to its bavarian roots, Wvrst serves beer in 1/2 litre steins as well.  They're quite large and heavy so you get a bonus bicep workout while drinking it.  The place is completely an open hall, so it does get kind of loud, but I guess that's part of the fun."}
{"text":"Yay! I finally got to give this place a try a few weeks ago. The inside definitely looks just like as the pictures show it, with that lively beer hall type atmosphere. Luckily it wasn't super busy on a Tuesday evening so there was enough room to move around when going to place our orders. The Wvrsts in a hotdog bun would fill you up more than order them just by themselves with their curry sauce. I'm not sure if I had the duck-fat fries or just the normal fries but it sure tastes good together with my Venison Wvrst in a bun. I think the wvrst in a bun order come with one complimentary dipping sauce and I picked the Sweet Chili Mayo which was great for dipping the bun in, but the winning condiment was definitely the horseradish mustard, man I just couldn't stop putting it on every bite of my sausage and bun. I just loved the punch that it gave everytime it went in my mouth. All-in-all it's a pretty neat place to hang out over some comforting German sausages and a good chat."}
{"text":"very loud, wish I could give half stars, solid 3.5 but not a 4.  sausage was good beer was okay...just very pretentious and unnecessarily loud...put up some sound absorbtion."}
{"text":"I love the big picnic table set up.  It's great for groups.  Also a great set up with kind of a fancy fast food place.  And of course, better with booze.    Not too pricey for unique tasting sausages.  I love the variety of meats you can get though I personally wasn't a a big fan of the spice/flavour pairings, but that's just me.  Some good vegetarian/vegan options as well.  Everyone seems to love duck fat fries but I'm not a big fan.  They were somewhat underwhelming to me.  Just plain old fries.  The thing I do like though is the delicious dipping sauces that I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just did a meetup with about 70 American and German expats at WVRST! We had an awesome time! Everyone loved all the different kinds of sausages (my elk was delicious), and the duck fat fries had them swooning. There was also much discussion of how amazing the beer selection is and how there were many beers on tap that you can't get anywhere else in Toronto. (Try the Church-Key Peat-Smoked Scotch Ale. Ahhhmmm yum yummmm noommmm yummm. Sooo good!) Food and drink aside, you've gotta love the atmosphere in here. It's cool, yet friendly and open and inviting. The communal tables encourage you to get to know your neighbors, and there always seems to be lots of beautiful people to watch. The lighting is excellent. This is the perfect place for a casual evening with good people, good food, and good beer. What could be better than that?!"}
{"text":"Best sausage Ive ever had (lamb) and a great selection of beers."}
{"text":"This is definitely the place to go if you want to try a variety of beers, ciders, wine, and sausages!! I was surprised at the extensive collection of local brews! The place is super casual. Reminded me of a cafeteria at school. When you get in, you basically seat yourself. The waiters will bring you menus once you are seated. You go to the back to pay for food and drinks or to the bar for drinks, and they will give you a number and bring your food and drinks to you. The food took about 15 mins to arrive.  There are a variety of sausages. We tried the duck with foie gras sausage (really good), rabbit (very gamey. Didn't like it very much), bacon wrapped sausage (comes in pieces. Pretty good), and the duck fries (a large portion but kinda soggy).   We had a bottle of cider and tried the tart and funky cider flight. The name definitely fit. It was funky alright!   I liked wvrst n will go again to try other things on the menu. The price is definitely affordable.  I give it a 3/5 because it didn't stand out to me as a must go place. I think if you like beer and want to do a causal hang out then this is a place for you. The line was long on a Friday, but it moved relatively quickly."}
{"text":"I was interested in checking this place out, since I frequent the Wurst Beer Hall in Calgary, AB. I've been in so many beer halls the last year and a bit, I kinda new what to expect. A wall of craft beers, an open kitchen and long tables to sit with strangers. It was pretty basic, but looked a little cheap to me, but I'm no real judge of that.  However, the staff was pretty quick and nice, the variety of beer is always nice and this was the first place outside of Germany I got to have Currywurst, which I really, really liked. The duck fat fries were also tasty. I liked food wrappers and trays too. Weird, but it was something that stood out.  I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Two words Dirty Duck! The fries here are just mind blowing, of course, why won't they be since they are deep fried in duck fat!! They are so delicious and crispy and yes they do not need much seasoning. They also have these amazing dipping sauces. I have tried the garlic and chive, maple/rosemary, chipotle and black pepper/onion. All were fantastic!   Let's not forget the other half the meal. The sausages here are so juicy, I am getting cravings just thinking about them. I have tried the game meats Kangaroo, Rabbit and Venison. I liked Kangaroo the best with a topping of caramelized onions and sweet peppers. You can get a raspberry lemonade to go with it if you are looking for a sweet fizzy drink. I think I have said enough about the food. The service here always very efficient and friendly. I am in love with this place... can't wait to be back for my next wvrst!"}
{"text":"Well, thanks to Wvrst! I finally got to taste rabbit and kangaroo.    Aside from the hype of the random meat available, this place is pretty neat.  The ambience of the dangling lights, the communal table setting.  It's a very chill place to have hot dogs at.  There are a variety of beer, but I don't drink alcohol so I wouldn't know how that goes.  The hot dog itself, it was alright.  The rabbit was juicy, very subtle.  If you're not that adventurous with your food, rabbit is a safe choice.  Kangaroo is more gamey, but not as strong as bison.  I say this because bison really caught me off guard.  If I would go back again, I'd go with the rabbit.    You have a list of sauces to choose from, that was cool.  You also don't have to have it hot dog style, you can try the curry-wvsrt, in which they slice it up for you and have sauce on top.  We had the wvrst sauce and rosemary for our fries.  It was tasty, but not too strong, so you can dip the entire fry and not feel overwhelmed.  I don't really know why the duck fat is a \"must try!\".  It's fries.  It was tasty, but I wouldn't say it's awmygard good.    I recommend this place to people who would like those different meat.  I find it a bit overpriced if you're just going to get a beef dog, because I can't imagine it having any wow factor.  My wow factor was I ate kangaroo, aside from that, the taste, sauces or dips weren't memorable for me.  I spent over $10 for one hot dog...no drinks...no fries yet.  It's still worth checking out."}
{"text":"Perhaps my favorite meal in visiting Toronto.  Both my friend and I loved our selections.  If you are a fan of German food or would just like a pretty good bang for your buck for a nice lunch-this is it!"}
{"text":"We tried the duck sausage and rabbit sausage. Both were very juicy and rich with flavour. Also tried the dirty duck fries, they were not bad but I think I would be satisfied with the regular duck fries. They also have great mustards here.  Love the environment, but better for summer because there's nowhere to put your jacket in the winter"}
{"text":"Bright inside. Went during the day. The use of garland lights brightened the interior. Credit cards are accepted. You have to order at the register then are given a number to place on the table, as the food is delivered to you when ready. Enjoyed the \"dirty fries- peppers, jalapeños & sauteed onions topped with the WVRST special sauce, along with curry bread. Enjoyed the chorizo as it is my favorite in general. The duck sausage was okay, my opinion. Mostly long tables are present, which are perfect for groups. Definitely resembles a german-style beer hall with a hipster vibe. Do recommend."}
{"text":"Great beer, incredible sausages, beer hall style communal seating, just a great fun environment."}
{"text":"Regular fries, not duck fat. More potato taste. Beer. Many. Too many. Not a problem. Sausage: Kaas if you want a juicy dog.  Boar is good, not gamey, hints of herbs.  Great bartenders   Nice spot for a birthday party"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! It was a Saturday night and we wanted a place close to Uniun to pre-game. They have so many different beers and ciders to choose from and so many on tap! I ended up drinking a cider all night because it was so good. Shannon and Sam took care of us so very well. We sat at the bar and they were so attentive to us even though so many people were coming going from the bar. They chatted with us about the establishment, the nuances of the beers, places around Toronto, a ton of things! It was nice to have a communal atmosphere that Wvrst offers. They have communal tables where you can sit anywhere and cozy up to a new buddy that night. The atmosphere was lively and you know the people are friendly.   I highly recommend going here. If beer isn't your thing then definitely try out the food. They didn't skimp on that either! The different kinds of fries you can have with all different types of dips. Best type of food you can pair with your beer. Whenever we come back to Toronto, we are definitely keeping this on our list of to dos."}
{"text":"Wvrst!! Ahh, I could wax poetic about this place. We first tried to come to wvrst to catch the Germany v Mexico match, but it was fully at capacity with tons of fans, so we came back later for lunch, which I'm super glad we did!   The atmosphere is based on a German beer hall, so expect wide communal tables, benches and a DIY service atmosphere - there's no table service here (they do drop your food off) and you order your food and drinks at the bar/ kitchen respectively. I would say this place is the best with a group - we went with three people and I think it would be even better with more.   They have a really interesting selection of sausages - our group tried the Merguez, Oktoberfest and Bison sausages. Our ranking was the folllwing: Oktoberfest, Bison & Merguez, with the suprise stand out being the bison! There is a nice simple selection of toppings including onion, sweet pepper and sauerkraut, along with ketchup and three types of mustard at the tables. We also split  some pretzels (which can be purchased singly or in a platter of 3) which came with an intense nose clearing spicy dijon mustard, and a large side of duck fat fries (which comes with your choice of two dipping sauces: we had kimchi mayo and sweet chili)   Wvrst has an excellent menu selection for the adventurous eater, or someone who just wants a classic German wurst experience - and with a 3-page beer list and an AWESOME selection of cider, I can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"If you wanna eat the best sausage in Toronto, you should try Wvrst. The food was great, too many options for the sausage in all kind. Also, they have excellent beers. The interior of the bar is so cool. I like the wooden benches and lighting is interesting. But remember you have to share your table with the others and that makes the environment so friendly. The prices are reasonable. I had great night there."}
{"text":"Really? Only 3.5 stars people?  Huh... This place is usually where I take uptown folks who need some downtown exposure because it's really what Toronto should be about - simple food with some subtle craziness, good booze selection, and a good buzz/crowd.    For those that don't read the interweb articles, Wvrst is nestled in the middle of the lounge/club district along King - which, by virtue of what it serves and how it serves it, makes it an interesting diamond in the rough.  When you go inside, it can be a bit intimidating, especially if it's a Saturday night - as you have to order yourself (left side for booze and sausage, straight ahead for booze only).  The crowd is not the usual group you'd see on their way to Cube down the street, or across at Jacobs - it's got some nice diversity: so while you'll spot the Bay St. yuppies, you'll also see a group of College kids.  Once other thing - despite it being a sausage bar, there always seem to be a lot of women.  Last time I was there I noticed a woman in the corner just casually eating a dog and downing a beer.  Good for you!  Highlights?  Duck fat fries for sure, bison, kangaroo, wild boar.  Don't even bother with the traditional sausages - it's like ordering a milk in a bar - you know they can do it, but why don't you just get it from the corner store instead and stop wasting their time?  One suggestion.... how about some really crazy Canadian sausages? e.g. moose, beaver, seal... anyone? anyone?"}
{"text":"I'm becoming more of a fan of farm to table establishments to which this certainly fits the bill, but here is a bit different in the sense that the menu is based on that principle applied to sausage related food and aperitifs. And a very, very extensive beer menu.  When you walk up the stairs to this mid-level dining room, you'll immediately notice the high-quality, dense wood assembled bench/pic nic seating and tables. It's like a mess hall but much nicer and with way better quality food. There is a wide variety of different sausages of course (you may have guessed from the name :D). This is not your frozen meat section at Safeway, this isn't even the counter st your favorite butcher shop, this is made-in-house homemade not from a supplier legit you won't find it anywhere else sausages, and the quality is very freakin' good! They let you choose everything from how its dressed, to the bun to sides and how it's cooked, and then you choose the drink to go along with it. For those who need to drive afterwards, there's a good supply of Italian soda and flavored waters and juices on hand, and for those who's palate is in need of some fresh suds, the aforementioned beer list is there for your continued enjoyment. There's not much to complain about in regards to the beer, the only thing I would warn newcomers of is that scattered throughout the list are some rare and imported selections which can go as high as $40-80, if memory serves correctly. Should you not be careful, you may order one by accident and be very surprised when the bill arrives (although I am fairly certain the staff would advise you of such a thing happening should you do so accidentally).  Food is served pretty quickly, staff is friendly. The clientele ranges from Queen West hipsters, to 20 something aspiring models and Bay Street types. This tells you something: No matter who you are, they all flock here for the food!  Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I've been going to WVRST ever since it opened; more frequently since I introduced my mom to the place this past summer.  (She LOVES it!). I typically go on a weekend afternoon for lunch, so I never deal with the craziness that other reviewers have described.  Although I am not a vegetarian, I generally go for vegetarian sausages as meat ones can be a little much for me.  I LOVE the black bean sausage at WVRST!  I get it on a bun with either sauerkraut or onions (depending on my mood) and jalapeños.  Spicy and awesome.  I have never had the duck fat fries, but the regular fries are amazing.  I love all the dipping sauce options!  I recently discovered that WVRST does takeout, which is perhaps the best news ever.  A great, quick option for when you're on your way home and starving!  I just finished my \"usual\", this time at home, and I'm already thinking about picking it up again for dinner tomorrow!  ***UPDATE***   As mentioned, my mom loves Wvrst, and we tend to go for lunch whenever she is in town.  We now have a tagalong - my infant son - and the staff at WVRST are incredibly helpful on this front.  I just call a few minutes before arriving, and they send somebody down to help me get the stroller up the stairs.  And they are obviously equally as helpful when it comes time for us to leave.  (And of course, they are happy to provide a high chair while we are there.)  My husband and I typically avoid restaurants which are inaccessible anymore - it's just too much effort - but WVRST makes continuing to visit easy."}
{"text":"Came here because the candyland was boring as heck at 11pm. This place is cool and hip. Lots of Communal seating and i think it works for the vibe of this resto/ bar. We got the beer sampler and it was great. It's just a really great place to chill. If i live here in Toronto, i would pick this place to hangout with friends."}
{"text":"I have been to pretty much all the restaurants in Toronto and this is probably the worst (how ironic) one with the poorest customer services. We had a large party for reservation at 7:00pm and I arrived at 7:30pm (bad traffic on a Friday) and was denied entrance by a bouncer:\" we are at capacity.\". After lining up for 15 minutes and I saw people walking out, I asked again, and yet was denied again :\"sorry you are only allowed 30 min grace period from your reservation even thought the other 19 ppl are all seated.\" Now it is 8:20pm and I am still waiting. If I could, I would have avoided at all causes. You have a choice, so do not go there as a large party especially you have ppl commuting!!!! Avoid at all causes."}
{"text":"WVRST is cool and hipster. Once you get into the restaurant, it's clear that the business knows their decor. The lights were beautifully strung and the communal seating welcomes large and small parties alike. Kinda wish there were some ping pong tables to complete the look.   The food merely met our expectations. The buns were good, the sausages were good, the fries were good, but nothing was super spectacular about it all. Would maybe come back if I needed a simple gourmet hot dog fix, but it's nothing too special. I didn't have enough of the menu items to form a solid overall opinion, but I wish I had tried the duck fat fries instead of the normal dirty ones. I love bell peppers, but I feel like they used too much of it here. Still good, though."}
{"text":"If you love sausage and you are open to experimenting, this is absolutely the best place to satisfy both. They do have regular dogs and/or sausage but they also have different game sausage like elk, kangaroo, bison, and the list goes on. The duck fat fries are bad for the thighs but wonderful in your tummy."}
{"text":"Good food but not nearly enough seating. The food is really good to be honest but the fries were lacklustre. The food comes quick none the less we had to pretty much fight for the spot."}
{"text":"Well worth the long walk!  I was recommended this place by a friend in Europe.  After a 4 or 5 mile walk I was ready for some cold beverages and hot food.  I walked in during the middle of the day and the place was empty.  I was unsure If I sat down and ordered or went to the counter to order.  Once I figured it our the staff was great and made a couple recommendations on the food and beverages and I was loving it!  The choices are plentiful and the staff certainly helped with my selection.  Very unique atmosphere with picnic tables.  The food was warm, portions are good and the prices are reasonable.    Oh yeah the fries are great too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We loved the sausages. I got the heritage pork with the curry sauce and loved it. Amazing healthy spot with high quality foods. They have wild meats like bison, elk, wild boar, pasture raised pork. Amazing fermented veggies and huge beer selection if you're into that - also cool atmosphere with communal tables. A little noisy but that's part of the ambiance I believe. Super reasonably priced. Also, the organic green salad was absolutely incredible. So glad to have stumbled upon this spot!"}
{"text":"Great social place with amazing food and good selection of beer with clean lines (unlike other draft places around town).  Game sausages are my favorite, and the duck-fat fries.  Try the Wvrst special dip with the duck fries - mmmmmm, good.   Lots of different beer choices and liter-ful mugs that will satiate your European beer craving.  Social seating on long benches (no individual tables) filters out the snobs and the social invalids, so everyone has a great time! Be ready for some elbow brushing and hanging out with total strangers sitting next to you (awesome!)!  The only reason why I cut off one star is because I wasn't impressed by their hot-dog like sausage and the curry-wurst preparation."}
{"text":"I have only been here twice but really enjoyed my meal both times. The sausage itself is super filling but its hard to resist the duck fat fries!"}
{"text":"This was the wvrst lunch I've ever had!  Sorry, had to get my pun in there like everyone else.  I came in on a Saturday afternoon to find the place fairly quiet. I didn't know how things worked so I just pulled up to a bench and waited. A staff member came over and explained that you have to order at the counter and they bring your food out to you.  After perusing the menu I took Sarah L.'s suggestion and went with the Curry Wvrst. I also went with the staff member's recco on lamb for the type of wvrst. I piled on some duck fat fries and topped it off with a pint of Weihstephaner.  While I was waiting for my meal someone came over who identified himself as a photographer for the Toronto Star. He was doing a story on the restaurant and asked if I would move over to the next bench so he could include me in some of his shots. I gladly obliged.  After a short wait my lunch arrived. The meal was delicious. I definitely recommend the curry. It was tomato-based which went well with the wvrst and the fries. The fries come with a dipping sauce so my choice naturally was the Wvrst sauce. It had a nice tang to it but wasn't as spicy as I would have liked.   Overall a really great experience."}
{"text":"OMG I feel like I need to move closer to this place just to go more often.  We had the duck dirty fries,  Tamworth sausage and the elk sausage,  as well as a flight of beer.  Can't go wrong with any of those choices.  I don't remember the last time I tasted anything as good as those fries.  I lived in Germany for awhile as a child and those fries brought me right back.  I'm still thinking about them,  can't wait to go back!   We went there on the family day weekend Sunday.  It was busy but not packed (almost all the seats were taken but there was enough movement that no one was really waiting for a seat). Great service.  We were greeted as we walked in and the waiter explained to us how it works.  You order up front and then they bring you your food.  Casual atmosphere but I loved the vibe.  Seriously, must try and I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Basically a cafeteria for a premium sausages with craft beer on tap.  Yup - it's easy to predict I would like this joint.  I had the duck sausage \"on a toasted fresh bun\" -- or most commonly known as a fucken' hot dog.  Come on, Wvrst -- there's no shame in calling it what it is.  Duck sausage was a no-brainer - whenever I'm presented with a menu choice and 'foie gras' is one of the options, it usually doesn't matter what else is available.  It's cruel and shamelessly decadent - you need to come up with a 'shark fin sausage' before I will order something else.  The duck sausage had a nice snap and was predictably rich.  I was advised by the cashier to just get sautéed onions for toppings as to not overpower the foie gras and that was the right move.  Not bad for $9.  I got the Dirty Duck Fries as well (peppers, jalapenos, sautéed onions and heavily doused with sauce).  Can't give a fair assessment on the duck fat fries as the toppings were overpowering.  I like the dirty fries, but it is very rich - my tablemate didn't enjoy it at all.  Luckily, my tastebuds can take a pounding.  Based on the duck sausage alone -- it would be 3-stars.  Compared to Hot Doug's (the pinnacle of all hot dog joints), this joint would be 2-stars.  Stack Wvrst's duck sausage against Hot Doug's foie gras dog... and Wvrst would be beat like it owed Hot Doug money.  But -- an extra star to Wvrst for the fine craft brew selection.  Sausages, fine craft beer and a decent patio?  Yup - will be back."}
{"text":"Great place for something a little out of the ordinary! I would highly recommend the kangaroo or wild boar hot dogs! Line getting in was a little long but totally worth it! I would go back!"}
{"text":"Kangaroo sausages?  Yes please.  Surprisingly not that gamey and had a perfect blend of spices.  My friend and I also ordered the duck confit fries which were quite good -- but I'm not 100% sure what the difference is between the normal fries and the duck confit (perhaps I would have to try both at the same time to see the difference.   As for my friend, he ordered the lamb.  It was pretty good, but I preferred the kangaroo instead.    In regards to whether one should order the currywurst or on a toasted fresh roll?  I would say to order the food on a toasted fresh roll if you're hungry; I felt like it wasn't enough just getting the currywurst.  Also, beer selection is great!  I was craving for a good European beer, and they had it at Wvrst (my friend got a Stiegl, and I had myself a Gosser -- reminded me of my short vacation in Europe during May).  For a place that doesn't have waiter-service, their service is amazing (does that even make sense?).  There were people coming by every now and then just to check up on us and to see if everything was fine.  I would definitely recommend this place for a nice snack and a drink if you're out on King West.  Not only this!  It's a non-swanky place to go to within the King West area -- which is needed.  I feel like that area has way too many restaurants that are a tad on the expensive side with them looking down on you when you're walking in.  Decor, like everybody else said, are communal tables - Oktoberfest style.  The funny thing is that it slightly reminded me of Guu with the incandescent lights placed on the top.  Would definitely come back here for another beer."}
{"text":"This place had so much going for it, but I was incredibly let down by the food. It's at King and Portland, the liveliest part of Toronto on Friday and Saturday nights due to the abundance of bars and clubs in the area. The setup inside is great. Picnic tables lined up sort of communal style, so lots of space for big groups. There are also some tables at the front of the shop for smaller groups. Their menu has lots of choices in terms of sausages and beers. I'm a pescatarian so I had a vegan black bean sausage, and I also ordered the fresh pretzel. The restaurant requires you order up at the counter and they give you a number to bring back to the table; so not a traditional sit-down style. I was super excited to try the black bean sausage, but the flavour was not good and it was actually kind of spicy, as well as unusually chewy. The only flavour I got was from the onions, ketchup, and mustard I had smothered the sausage in. I enjoy St. Yve's veggie dogs that I get from the grocery store more than I did this one.  The pretzel is not Auntie Anne style--it is way smaller, just a circle shape, and comes with mustard that does NOT make it taste better. It is pretty hard, not crunchy and then soft like you get with good pretzels. We also had a variety of beers, which are all foreign beers I think? because I didn't recognize any of the ones on the menu. We ordered three different kinds of beer and I didn't like the flavour of any, which is probably just bad luck because the list is soooo expansive that there are bound to be at least a couple good ones. The sausages are a bit pricey at $9-$10. Pretzel was an okay price at $3.25, and fries range from around $4-14 depending on if you get dips and toppings on them. Anyways, I feel like I just ordered all the wrong things when I visited this place. Maybe I'll come back if I start eating meat again?"}
{"text":"Duck fat fries.  Duck fat fries.  Duck fat fries.  Duck fat fries.  Gimmie more duck fat fries.  Sausage.  Beer.  Woo!"}
{"text":"I came here for a friends birthday on a Saturday night in May.  The atmosphere is casual and fun with cafeteria style shared tables and you have to line to place an order. We had to take turns lining up, in order to save our table...so we spent too much time away from each other!  The sausages and duck frites were nothing special.  I did enjoy the drink selection.  I would not recommend coming here for a meal because it's not worth the hassle of waiting 20 minutes in line for an average tasting sausage."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to Wvrst and I think they have something unique going on in the city with their Bavarian inspired sausages and beer hall. The decor (red tiled wall, wooden floors and tables and chic lighting) creates a casual yet trendy vibe. I've brought many a visitor or friend here and they have been impressed with the fact that they could get an elk, bison or kangaroo sausage and the dirty fries. They also have a good craft beer selection on draft.  The place is accessible for vegans, vegetarians and those who are gluten free. Vego/vegans have a few sausage options to choose from. Whenever I order one of the vegan sausages the cashier is quick to point out that the bun and sauerkraut are not vegan (props that the staff have good knowledge of the product). One of them told me that the sauerkraut was not vegan because it was cooked in beer. Now I'm confused, care to elaborate? Beer itself is often/usually vegan unless animal products are used in the filtration process. If you went to the trouble of offering vegan sausages why would you not also use a vegan beer for your sauerkraut? I'm sure it is the most commonly requested filling. Same for the buns which are buttered. I'd simply also offer non buttered buns. Not that I'm vegan myself but if you are going a little bit of the way you may as well go the whole way. (It's like pumpkin soup in pubs that is made with chicken stock...why?) Now for you gluten free and vegan folk you have the option of a currywurst. That is the sausage sans bun with a curry sauce. And there is also gluten free beer available.  Favourite things: - mediterranean or chickpea sausage with sauerkraut and onion. I find the blackbean one is pretty dry. - dirty vegetarian fries. Def a small size because that is already so large. They also have dirty duck fat fries for all you carnivores. - pretty good customer service even when it is busy  Some (constructive) criticisms: - I find the drinks kind of pricey so I don't often drink here - Having only one person on the cash register when it is really busy. On Friday or Saturday night you might have 20+ people in the queue to order and it tends to take ages because all questions about the menu are directed to the person on cash. - The unusual management of the place's capacity by bouncers on busy nights. Sometimes you are forced to wait outside on the stairs for two people to come out and then when you get in there it isn't that busy. Or you have a reservation for 10 and 9 people are there. When the 10th person arrives they have to wait outside in line because the place is \"full.\" I mean, really? So weird and not very smooth. Their bouncers kind of remind me of those at the Lakeview Diner at 4am. I will say one thing though: they are fair. If you are waiting in the line they won't let any random person waltz in and push in front of you."}
{"text":"Awesome chill vibe. A little over priced for cheese add on on the hot dog. Love the open seating and beer hall aspect. Great mingling spot."}
{"text":"Came here for a casual dinner on a Sunday night around 7pm--no wait and plenty of room to sit (I've heard it's pretty busy most evenings so Sunday seems like as good time to go!). I had:  -Chicken/Turkey Jalapeno Sausage -Duck Fat Fries with Wvrst Sauce  The Chicken/Turkey Sausage I would give 3 stars because it had a lot less flavor than I expected and was fairly dry. It was not a juicy as my friend's who got a pork sausage. The roll got pretty soggy by the time I finished it too.  The Duck Fat Fries get 5 stars, SO good. Really tasty with just the right amount of crunchy, salty goodness. Didn't really need the sauce because they were so good, but the sauce was good too  Awesome beer/cider list! I would come back here for fries and beer/cider and maybe try one of the other sausages"}
{"text":"Came to Wvrst on a Friday evening with one friend around 9:00PM. Waited in line outside to get in, and there were many other people behind us when we were admitted, so it seems they get pretty busy. I had never been here before so I wasn't aware of the 'seating arrangements' of this particular establishment. Basically, there are a few long, communal tables and some smaller tables off to the side. You grab your menu and find a seat. Sounds simple enough, but when the place is packed to capacity (and they count heads, they don't look to see if there's an actual spot for your party), good luck. I think we got lucky because there was only two of us, but we still had to hunt around for awhile. Not a fan.  Next order of business is deciding what you want. You then have to leave someone behind to guard your seats and go up to the counter to order your own food. They give you a table marker so your food can be delivered when it's ready. We ordered the bison, duck and wild boar sausages on buns with sweet sauteed onions and sauerkraut, and then a large order of the duck fat fries to share with chili tomato jam and chipotle as our dipping sauces. Somehow the guy that served us at the counter ended up charging us for an extra order of dirty fries, which I don't know how he managed because neither of us even mentioned them. We only realized after our food had been delivered to us that something was amiss. Not wanting to cause a scene, we decided to let the extra $8 addition to our bill slide. Beyond that, none of the staff encountered at this visit were particularly friendly at all. Lame.  As for the food, all three sausages were fantastic, the bison and duck being on the sweeter side and the wild boar more savoury. Out of the three, I'd say the bison was best. We ordered the fries because I had read that they were supposed to be great, their website even reminds you that 'WVRST has won Now Magazine's Best Fries in Toronto award - three years in a row.' I can't see why. They were soggy and lame, my mind is blown by how this could be a fact. Even the dirty fries we didn't ask for were pretty lame. We only ate about half of them. The chili tomato jam was good, chipotle was boring, neither were very spicy at all, even though they are advertised as such.  The quality of the sausages are what saved this meal and the fact that I want to try the elk and kangaroo options are pretty much the only reason why I'll be back."}
{"text":"The variety of sausages makes this place really successful, especially when you go with a large group, you can try one another's sausages--wait, what?   For this space, it's a little battlezone where you've got to claim a spot as soon as you see one available. It gets pretty packed so I'd recommend making reservations if you're going with a huge group. Good vibes, great food selection, however a tad loud for conversation."}
{"text":"1.) I have never written a review for a restaurant before, even though I am constantly trying new places. 2.) I don't even like sausages, at all. 3.) I'm a vegetarian. But even with all of those things considered, I am in LOVE with this place. The atmosphere is great, and makes you feel like you are intimately dining even though the tables are shared. Ordering is so smooth, the vegetarian options are impeccable, and everything is very reasonably priced. I am not from the Toronto area, and I have just been searching for a simple place with good food, a bar with interesting variety, without breaking the bank. I am already planning on going back for lunch tomorrow (lol)!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening around 6pm and while a good number of the tables were reserved we were able to find a spot for 2 people. The place is open with long benches rather than small tables. It was quite loud so it may be difficult to have a conversation with someone who is sitting across the table. We shared the danger dog currywurst style and the lamb on a hot dog as well as large belgian fries with 2 sauces. The curry sauce was quite mild compared to some of the other available sauces but delicious nonetheless. They also have a very large selection of beer."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night, I do understand get all the hype.  The place was very crowded, and just wayyy too loud. The tables are long mess-hall type shared tables. So when the (very drunk) group next to us got rowdy, we had to suffer through the mini-earthquakes as they pounded the table and yell-taked to each other.  In fact, everyone kind of has to yell-talk given the level of drunkenness in a condensed area.  They do have a good beer selection though. Sausages were quite nice, but limited other food options. Again - I don't get the hype.  Maybe I just came at the wrong time, and not at the right level of drunk. Definitely the right vibe for the 2nd or 3rd bar of the night, or coming back from a club."}
{"text":"I found this place one yelp and the reviews has not disappointed me. The food was great. Sad that I didn't dine in because my husband and I were super tired from touristy stuff. We ordered carryout, the two of us ordered $50 bucks worth of food. The pheasant, kangaroo, and duck brocks. It was delish... I love the duck, my fave. Wish they have this in Chicago. The duck fat fries were so good too... everything was great, the service was good. The atmosphere inside look so comfy and nice... really wish we would've dined in."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for a while as they had game sausages. This past weekend, I finally got to try it. We ordered the Kangaroo ($9.75), Elk ($9.75), and of course the Duck Fat Fries (large, $8.25).   We chose to top both the hotdogs with sauerkraut and sautéed onions. The onions could have been cooked longer for a softer texture. I personally preferred the taste of the elk over the kangaroo. I was really excited to try the fries and while they had a great texture, I found them to be too salty.   The interior was nice, with a cool atmosphere but a bit loud. It's a nice place to grab a drink, food and hang out with friends."}
{"text":"I had the Oktoberfest sausage and duck fat fries,  with the peppercorn and Parmesan sauce.   The fries and dip were very tasty !   I really enjoyed them.  The sausages was alright.   My friend got the danger sausage and it looked very good,  next time that is the one ai will go for.      So limited menu but very tasty fries and the sausages are not bad..."}
{"text":"This place is an all-round good time. Nice place to hang out and chill, comfort food on the menu, and you can just have a few drinks too. And I don't even care much for hot dogs/sausages personally. It's not an easy place to show up at with a large group - seating is along these long communal tables. It can get a bit hectic as time as people try to hunt for seats. Otherwise, the place has a nice bit of charm with the dangling ceiling lights. Staff are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Omg I don't know how they did it but they somehow made this place even better than before. Some amazing additions = 1) salted maple rosemary soft serve ice cream. Holy shit wtf is this other than pure bliss in a paper cup?!? It oddly but awesomely tastes like Indian ice cream (kulfi) but that is part of the magic. 2) raclette. It's amazing. Just get it on everything. My favourite sausage this time around was the bison. So lean, so flavourful. The line up is there for a reason people!!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and unique hot dogs. It's like a cafeteria style setting where everyone sits at the long benches. It can get quite loud there but it's a pretty fun place to hang with friends. They serve a lot of different types of sausages (gamey meats and traditional meats), perfect for the adventurous or just the people who love an old fashion hot dog. I tried the kangaroo sausage with duck fat fries and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Note that this is a review of their vegetarian dishes only.   I went to Wvrst with some friends, we've been wanting to try it for a while. I wouldn't normally go to a sausage restaurant as I'm vegetarian, but my interest was piqued after viewing their menu and seeing that they, in fact, had a few vegetarian options that looked interesting.   It's easy for a restaurant like this to shrug off vegetarians, so I appreciate the fact that they didn't. It's also easy for a place like this to have a \"token\" vegetairan dish that isn't really well thought through (i.e. a salad or something else that's not fitting with the restaurant's theme). This isn't the case here.   I shared both of the vegetarian sausages on the menu (italian and paprika kielbasa) both ways. You can select any of their sausages and have it either as \"curry wvrst\" or on a bun. We had the italian as curry wvrst and the kilebasa on a bun. We also got the dirty vegetarian fries. Oh, and beer, we also had beer.   The curry wvrst was good, but not great. I'm not sold on the way they served it: a cut up fried sausage with a small dipping bowl of curry sauce and a slice of toast.   The sausage on a bun was great. You get to select two of four toppings (caramalized onions, sautéed jalapeños, saurkraut and sautéed sweet peppers). The bun was delicious, the sausage was very well done and the toppings added a perfect amount of flavour to accent the deliciousness of the kielbasa. I would order this again, definitely.  The dirty vegetarian fries were also pretty good. They were fries topped with caramelized onions, sautéed peppers and perhaps something like the curry sauce. The forks they came with were annoying - little wooden prongs like you would get at a chip stand. The forks were cute, but not very functional, and they're wasteful when a regular fork would be preferred. The large size was too big for two, but I don't know how small the small is.   Dipping sauces are good, I had the wvrst house sauce and black pepper sauce. I would only get one next time since they were good, but not great. And a little pricey at $1 each (for what amounts to be about 2 tablespoons of mayonaise).   The beer selection was also very very good. The beer was a bit pricey, but they have unique brews that you can't find many other places.   Atmosphere was a bit loud, but the design is great. It's reminiscent of a German beer garten that you would find at Oktoberfest. There is a large table in the corner for parties that is more private.   Oh, and a note to vegans: The vegetarian sausages are both vegan, but the bun isn't (it has eggs in it). Everything else vegetarian is vegan except for the mayonaise or yogurt based dipping sauces.   And, all their sausages (including the vegetarian ones) are made by them, not a third party supplier.   I would definitely recommend this place as something you should check out."}
{"text":"I'm gonna keep this short and simple and just say that if anyone who is interested in trying this place, definitely should! The decor and set up of this place was really cool and although the food is pretty simple it was very delicious and filling! It was so hard to choose which meat I wanted to get because there was just so many options but I got the guinea hen with the curry sauce and loved every bite. The curry sauce wasn't the curry I expected (it was I think a tomato based kinda tangy curry sauce) which went with the guinea hen very nicely.   I don't remember what kind of meat my friend got but she got it in the sandwich and also loved it. We also shared some duck fat fries which were tasty, especially the jerk sauce that we chose for it!! Overall had a really positive experience and possibly might come back if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"Wvrst - how do I love thee, let me count the ways!  Come here if you love sausages, traveled in Central Europe and totally miss a good Currywurst.  Come here if you are a HUGE fan of craft beer, love Bar Volo, the Rhino, and you will love their beer selection, as well as their crafty tap set-up.  Come here if you are usually classy, but it's a Thursday night and you need to escape the prudes with a bender on KiWe.  Come here if you are so healthy you run marathons, but need a good dose of duck fat fries with extra dipping sauce on the side.   I can't remember how many times I've been to Wvrst on zero notice and had a great night. It may have been a day that ends in Y. The beer manager knows his stuff. On a lucky day you can get a taps takeover of Dieu du Ciel, Sawdust City, and many more.   As for the sausages, try everything. I highly recommend the duck, bison and rabbit. For dipping sauces, maple/rosemary reigns supreme.   This place is so uniquely Toronto that whenever I take out of town guests here, especially Europeans, they want to spend endless hours inside."}
{"text":"Had a bratwurst currywurst style with double meat. Portions are tiny. Tasty though, but not 'oooooh' tasty. Was ridiculously overpriced, especially since it's all self serve. Typical King street markup. Great beer selection, but better off going somewhere else for it."}
{"text":"Love eating funky animal meat? If you do, this place is for you!  They have all sort of animal sausages such as bison, elk, wild boar, rabbit, kangaroo etc...    So basically, you choose a sausage then a style (on a bun or currywvrst).  If you choose to have it on a bun, you can choose two toppings (sweet sautéed onions, sauerkraut, sautéed jalapeños, sweet peppers).   Ive never had elk before and my friend was raving how good this meat was so I decided to give it a shot.  I had elk on a bun with sweet peppers and sweet sautéed onions.  The elk tasted kinda fatty.  I had a taste of my friend's bison and I enjoyed that so much more.     I also ordered duck fat fries, which came with a dipping sauce.  My friend ordered the dirty fries (jalapeños, sweet peppers and sauteed onions topped with WVRST special sauce).  He was complaining how there were so much veggies/toppings and didn't have much of the actual fries.  I ended up sharing some of my fries.  I must say duck fat fries tastes AHMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Game meats, Sausages AND beer?!? OOoohhh YEAAAHHH!!  But please pronounce it correctly.  It's \"verst\", not \"worst\" (drives me insane!).  Came here a while back, but still remember it like it was yesterday.  Located in the hip and happening King St. West of downtown Toronto, it undoubtedly carries the loud and fun atmosphere... especially on a Friday night.  It was packed and difficult to find a table.  There is no host, and is a semi self-served restaurant, where you order at the counter/bar and a server will bring you the food and drinks.  You can choose to sit at the high tops by the window, or at the long communal tables in the middle.   We just walked up to the glass meat fridge to take a look at all the different wursts this place has to offer.  I was super excited!  After a billion years of INdecision-making, I finally ordered at the counter beside the the sausages:  Kangaroo Wurst w/ fine herbs: $9 (3/5 stars) It was very good.  I got a side order of the curry wurst sauce, which is a tomato curry for dipping ($4).  The sauce itself was mediocre- very strong tomato flavour with a hint of  curry powder maybe.  Definitely way over-priced especially if you consider that it came in a small little plastic container.  Venison w/ dijon & red pepper: $9 (3/5 stars) Had this on a toasted bun.  It tasted good, but it needed some kind of sauce.. like mayo or ketchup or something.  Because you share the condiments with other people at the table, we had to go to the next table to grab some.  Nothing too spectacular.  Duck Fat Fries: $6.50 (5/5 stars) This was probably the hi-bite of the night!  Who doesn't like duck fat anything?!?!  But what made this ultra delicious was the side of maple rosemary dipping sauce ($1) to go with it!  It's 4am, and I'm craving fries now...Mmmm.  I wish the sauce came in a bigger portion though.  Beers: (5/5 stars) There was a German beer that I really wanted to try (forgot the name), but they didn't have it! But overall, a pretty decent selection.  Service: (2/5 stars) I understand it was busy, but they did nothing but bring me food and checked up on us once (sort of).  I wanted to ask for something, and they just whizzed by giving me no chance.    This place was very loud on a Friday night, and was almost impossible to have a conversation across the table without having to yell.  Most of the people here are for the beer and grabbing a bite, as oppose to having dinner.  I've also noticed one of the giant tables were reserved for a party coming in, so I guess they do resos.    The food is okay, but I'd definitley come back.  I'm dying to try to duck sausage, which is supposedly the best one!  Which one is your fave?"}
{"text":"I don't know. I wanted to love this place. It advertised everything that I love, especially pork and beer. The ratings were good. I'm not an Ambience person normally, because I prefer to find good Street Food. However if I was to judge it, I would say overall it was like kind of dark and dim, not like a German beer garden outside in the spring summer or fall. I ordered the rabbit sausage, with red peppers, it was okay, not nothing I would go back for or anyting, but I can appreciate Artesian sentiments. And there might have been better sausage there but I don't know, it just didn't thrill me the way I expected it to. And if you are planning on drinking beer there, I hope you have a hefty balance left on your credit card, because that definitely was not cheap by no means. Maybe I'm just not a hipster, so....WVRST. I was disappointed. I think your intentions were Noble. Good luck to you."}
{"text":"though it's expensive i did enjoy my time here it's very unique  german beer hall vibe communal bench seating style be prepped to mingle  their menu features varieties of wurst meats plus famed duck fat fries  i ordered merguez, a lamb and harissa wurst with flavours that burst  quite small for the price maybe three-quarters the size of street meat hot dogs  impressive tap list to pair with the sausages  and please the beer fans"}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying Wvrst, ironically right after binging at Taste of Toronto and it did not disappoint. Ordered the Oktoberfest sausage which is a combination of pork, beef and sage and it was juicy and full of flavour. It might seem like the sausage is a bit oily but that helps to enhance the taste. Since it was our first time, we weren't daring enough to try any of the game sausages but I think I'll try kangaroo or rabbit next time.   We also ordered the duck fat fries which were nice and crispy and complimented the sausage well. They have such an extensive menu that there's always something new to choose from. Although we were full and unable to try their soft serve, I'm looking forward to trying the salted maple with duck fat fry bits on our next visit."}
{"text":"LOVE the duck fat fries  You almost cannot go wrong with any sausage you pick  A massive beer selection  Great staff and great ambience"}
{"text":"Why haven't I written up a review for this yet?  Pick your game - Duck? Bison? Elk? KANGAROO?? WVRST sure has a ton of intriguing meats and sausage stuffings to offer. I think it takes a bit of variety each time you go, to really understand how the different flavours match up against each other, so.. be sure to bring friends!  The set up is pretty neat - open communal benches line the majority of the restaurant, with some high-top tables over by the windows and a sweet group area to have a party. The place fills up quick in the evening and if you're too late, you gotta wait for people to leave before you're admitted in. What is this.. a club?  On my most recent endeavour there, I had the DUCK (maple/foie gras) on a bun. It definitely had a rich rich flavour to it. Our group had a nice assortment of dishes - all on the BUN though (the other option is a currywurst style but I think it is less filling that way..).  My criticism here will only be about the setup and order method. The 'go-up-to-the-cash-to-order' system pretty much forces someone in your party to line up for a long time to put in your table's orders. It also makes splitting the bill a little awkward.   Anyways - come in and check it out. I recommend a small-to-medium size group between 2-5. Any more than that, and you'll be hard pressed to find seating during peak days/hours.   Bier On!"}
{"text":"This place gets really busy and often has a line out the door despite being pretty big. I can't say it's that surprising though, as they have great food and good beer. I usually get the Berkshire sausage on a bun and it's delicious. My friends and I did a comparison of the regular fries and the duck fat fries, and we all (well, the non vegetarians, anyway) agreed that the duck fat fries are better. I've also had the dirty duck fat fries which are delicious (be prepared for the spicy jalapeños). I usually get cider when I'm there (they have a few different options), but they have a really great list of beers.   Prices for booze are average, however I think that the prices for food are very reasonable. Communal tables which I think is fun when everyone's drinking (it can get a little rowdy). I'd probably give this place closer to 4.25 stars. Staff are very friendly and I've only ever had good experiences with service."}
{"text":"We came across this place on instagram and then saw that the yelp looked good so we headed there at an off-ish time to ensure we wouldn't have to wait. A bunch of tables were reserved for a party but we sat right away (2 of us around 4-5 pm). Food was on point. The people at the counter were friendly and helpful, as we wanted to order everything but they helped us make some decisions. We each got a beer flight and ordered 3 sausages and dirty duck fat fries between the 2 of us. we were definitely full but also finished it all eating super leisurely as the place was pretty empty until about 7. Ice cream was underwhelming, could've skipped it."}
{"text":"I don't know how I almost forgot these guys, one of my top 5 favourite places to eat on a recent work trip.  The lunch lineups are long--too long, as it wasn't that there were that many people but too many options to choose from.  Choose your bun, the type of sausage, your toppings...so it's a good minute or two before cashier takes the next order.  Luckily, our client took us out, and did all the ordering.  As long as it wasn't too wild, i know it sounds boring, but I was really impressed by the seating arrangement and decor.   Lots of sharing tables.  This is a massive place, and a great date nite once I say, you're on 3rd base ;)"}
{"text":"Great place! Such a reach variety of bear and sausages! That is impressive! I have celebrated my birthday there. While there is only one private table if you book it in advance, it is really good to get together with friends and family! I would recommend to anyone for food and drinks!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Really captured the German beer hall feel! It gets busy, even on weekdays.   The whole thing is set up so that you order your food at drink before you grab a seat with a number they've given you. They tables are banquet style so that everyone sets next to everyone. They have a wide variety of sausages to choose from (I have yet to have a bad one), and the duck fat fries with the different dips are DELICIOUS! The beer selection is also quite big with rotating taps and bottle available as well.    Service is friendly and fast! Everything (a sausage, fries, and beer all come out to about 30$). The atmosphere is really what you come for, it's open, bustling and a great place to sit and talk (and people watch).   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. The service is.....wait for it....the wvurst (too easy). If you're ok with aloof wait staff and way too many staff constantly circulating looking to clear your glassware and plates (like literally every five minutes) go for it."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times, ever since they opened really. I've always enjoyed their diverse sausage selection and their ever improving beer list. I've happy that they've done so well. However, I'm less than happy about this recent visit. My friend and I got there on a Wednesday evening. There was a section that blocked off for a large party. My friend and I managed to get seats as we had one more friend that was joining us. We ordered beer and food while waiting for him.   However, when our friend was at the door he was denied entry by the bouncer, because apparently they are expecting a large party that would push the head count over so he wouldn't let our friend on. My friend tried to reason with him, saying that we've already ordered food, not to no avail. So we tried to tell them to cancel the food order, but they can't do that either. So our friend had to wait until there were people leaving before he was allowed in.   The food and service were fine once we were inside, but that left a bitter taste in our mouth. It would've been better to know when we first walked in, or if they had a better system to let us know."}
{"text":"This is a specialty place . It serves variety of fresh , juicy sausages on a bun of choice and sauce of choice . The bar has a huge beer collection .   Love the ambience , especially the ceiling lights . Great for groups.   Bench style seating .Slightly noisy during peak weekend hours."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good take on a German beer hall. Although the atmosphere is much more sophisticated then what you would find in germany. You also wouldn't find duck fat fried French fries and kangaroo sausage. This place is great to take a bunch of people Helen you want something different then an ordinary pub."}
{"text":"This place is stellar. Great sausage, *amazing* fries. Nearly everything on the menu (except the obvious beer) can be done gluten-free rather easily, and nothing with gluten gets fried in the fryer. The staff is awesome and extremely helpful about answering questions.  If you're gluten-free, get the sausage curried instead of with a bun. You're not missing out -- the curry is excellent.  Order the duck fat fries, too. I didn't know I was missing anything from my life until I tried these.  Good cider selection.  Maybe don't go here if you're vegetarian. I didn't check for veg options, but my guess is there aren't a ton."}
{"text":"Deciding to try out this spot upon arriving to Toronto turned out to be a great choice. They have a great environment with very pleasant and helpful employees. I got an extremely well crafted and full of flavor black bean sausage (vegan) on a toasted bun topped off with sautéed onions and sweet peppers with a side of sauerkraut. The fries and tomato chili paste nearly stole the show though. Perfectly fried and home made cuts of fries. Overall a more than pleasant dinner."}
{"text":"This place is all hype. Not sure what I was expecting really, since i've had currywurst in Berlin and wasn't impressed there. Ketchup with some curry powder thrown in.. revolutionary! The worst part is how expensive it is. You pay like $6 for that.  And its just a small sliced up sausage with the ketchup drizzled on, accompanied by an anemic toasted rye bread slice. The duck fat fries were meh. nothing special.  On the positive side they do have a decent beer selection. It includes most of the german wheat beer exports you'de expect (Weihenstephaner, Hacker-Pschorr, etc) and some good local brews like Beau's. But again, expensive. I think I paid $7.25 for my beer. A bit steep.  I will say this place would probably be fun around Octoberfest. They've got the picnic tables, its a huge space, and the good beer. We'll see if they stay in business long enough for that :P"}
{"text":"I have never, ever loved fries any more than I have loved the duck-fat fries from WVRST. We ordered those to share, with the raclette cheese and chive + garlic dips, as well as a Tamworth pork sausage and a Berkshire pork sausage.   PROS:  *Huge selection of sausages and beverages (unfortunately I do not drink beer and cannot speak on that portion of the experience) *Has game options for the adventurous (e.g., kangaroo, pheasant, elk) *I cannot rave any more than I already do about the duck fat fries *Communal ambiance making it basically a hipster cafeteria, with a few hushed away tables for those who want more intimacy  CONS:  There is nothing bad I can say about WVRST. Trying out the duck fat fries was the closest I have ever come to experiencing a god. A large order of fries can easily be tucked away by two people and comes with two dips. The chive + garlic dip only accentuated the flavour of the fries, sending me away in a savoury bliss. The sausages come with options such as sweet peppers and sauerkraut, which can be ordered hot or cold. The cold sauerkraut was milder than expected, which was great because it added a bite to the texture of the sausage. There is an interesting sign on the middle of the ceiling, saying, \"don't be afraid to meet someone new!\", referring to the communal seating. Who knows if you'll find your next beau at WVRST?  Overall, I would definitely, definitely return."}
{"text":"The duck fat fries were succluent it melts in your mouth  The sausage is phenomenal lamb merguez it is phenomenal  I highly recommend this place you can meet new people they have a very open concept  Definitely coming back again"}
{"text":"Good food but bad for severe allergy / food intolerance sufferers. I have celiac gluten intolerance as well as dairy and egg allergies. I was advised that if my allergies were severe I would be fine if they prepped the sausage I was advised we safe in a separate pan. Was fine the night of eating but now am doubled over with stomach cramps and nausea.  No thanks."}
{"text":"I really loved this place, it's a really unique restaurant that has meats normally not served in other places like kangaroo, elk and more, it's a huge cafeteria hall that has benches and it's a self serve place with quite a variety of beer...we got the bison sausage which was really juicy and sweet since they marinated it In blueberry and maple sauce, the other sausage was wild boar which is a bit more salty but still good, u get ur choice of toppings like onions, sweet peppers and 2 more I forgot.....we got the duck fat fries which honestly to me didnt taste like anything special compared to regular fries but their dipping sauce was amazing, got the sweet chili and chives and garlic  Will definiety come back to this place"}
{"text":"Awesome food. This place is great for a real German style restaurant experience. Feels like Oktoberfest without polka. Bratwurst is great and plentiful. Many different kinds of meat available including kangaroo if you feel adventurous. Not much more to say, you won't be disappointed. Tip though if you are not picky about beer, side bar is much less expensive than ordering from the full beer list at the counter."}
{"text":"If you want to enjoy a great wurst with killer fries and wide selection of beers. This is your place"}
{"text":"The entrance to Wvrst looks more like an upscale nightclub than a sausage bar - you go up a set of stairs towards a large, tiled W, so it's a surprise when you open the door to see bright Christmas lights on the ceiling and long, egalitarian wooden tables for seating - it resembles more of a European hostel cafeteria than a classy bar that serves exotic meats.  It's pretty hard to tell which plaid-garmented, mustachioed hipster male actually works at the bar and which one is simply enjoying some bison sausage. After my experience there, I still really can't tell, except that our server was the one taking our orders.   As far as I can tell, you seat yourself. Our server was very informative - we were here for the 5$ Monday beer specials, and we weren't sure what to try. If you're not sure, or new to beer, they're very generous about letting you sample them before you buy.   Service was very prompt - our server was awesome and very helpful with our questions. Of course, we were there on a Monday night and the restaurant was pretty empty.  So many exotic meats - we got the kangaroo sausage. Very robust flavors, very meaty texture - quite similar to a very lean pork. Delicious and worth a try - we got it currywurst style, even if the menu advised against it. The curry was delicious - complemented the sausage but did not overpower it.  Awesome experience, would absolutely recommend. So glad I went!"}
{"text":"Great selection of sausage and their sauce is flavorful and well spicy. Great selection of beer too. I like their interior. It's a good place if you want to have a quick food and a few drinks with your friends."}
{"text":"Amazing assortment of unique sausages, sauces, sides, and drinks.  Great atmosphere.  Nice place to go and hang out with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Pros: - great service - very generous w/napkins!  So we went in and walked right up to the counter to order...other people were given menus and sat at the tables before going up to the counter. After ordering, you get a #, sit down, and they'll bring food out to you. There are 4 sauces on the tables (1 ketchup, 3 kinds of mustard, I think) for you to put on top of your hot dog, too.  We tried: - guinea fowl: hot dog w/cheddar/asparagus.. we thought it was meh, but it's prolly just personal preference - duck: maple/foie gras.. the bf didn't think it tasted sweet, but I tasted the maple, and it threw it off for me (I don't like sweet & savory combined).  - danger dog: bacon wrapped hot dog.. this is what I ordered bc I'm not an adventurous eater, and I was very pleased with my hot dog! - the buns the hot dogs came on was reeeeally good, but there was a lot more bread than sausage, IMO. You also get to put stuff on your hot dogs (we opted for sauteed sweet onions). - large duck fat fries: disappointing :( ours came out soggy, and I didn't taste the duck fat flavor (we ordered our fries with...) - wvrst original dipping sauce: this tasted like diluted sriracha, so we wouldn't really rec it - chipotle (mayo based) dipping sauce: soo good, and they gave us a pretty generous portion, too! - weinhenstephan beer  Overall, it was just okay. I was excited to come bc the bf likes hot dogs + beer, but I think we thought it was just average. Don't get me wrong - it's a pretty cool place, great environment, awesome service, but I think it was just a matter of our personal preferences."}
{"text":"I want to give them 10-billion stars for the duck-fat fries alone.  17 kinds of ground animal, a multitude of delicious craft beers (and even PBR, which is $10 for a litre) and the fries... the fries!  THE FRIES!  I only wish the beverage re-ordering process were easier than going back into the queue.   First visit: Rabbit Second visit: bison Third visit: venison Fourth visit: I think I'll try the 'roo.  (yes, the kangaroo)  I live so close!  They have fulfilled all of my tube-steak hopes and dreams."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 10+ and was able to get lunch reservations. You order and pay first then they bring the food to the table. They have a wide selection of beer which is great. The staff is very knowledgable about the different sausages they have. I ended up ordering the wild boar (mushroom and tea). We also got duck fat fries with raclette melted cheese on top. The cheese gets cold fast so if you're not going to consume the fries right away, it's going to get hard and not very appetizing. I wish we just got the plain duck fries. The fries dipping sauces we chose included maple Rosemary, truffle mushroom mayo (the best one), and sweet chilli. All tasty."}
{"text":"I have never seen so many different variety of hot dogs. The atmosphere was south western but a very young crowd which gave it a pub type feeling. Great place after hours! The setting of the place is very rustic and has a very welcoming vibe. I had gone there with a few friends and I had the duck fat fries and it really did taste different from other places I have been able to try. They're open pretty late and the turnaround time after ordering is pretty quick!!"}
{"text":"During our trip to Toronto, my boyfriend and I tried a lot of restaurants and were disappointed. But this gem right here--- OHMEHGERDDDD! This place makes my top 10 list of favorite restaurants ever!  I have this thing where I like to try unusual foods every vacation. I was scrolling through Yelp and saw that this restaurant had kangaroo sausage and said to myself, \"this is it!\" As soon as we walked in, I heard some JT playing and I was sold. Wvrst has a very chill vibe, with picnic-style tables and benches in the center of the place. It wasn't crowded at all, lightly filled. My bf and I were very overdressed, as we planned on going to a lounge after, but I didn't care.. I just wanted to eat!  We walked up to the counter and a very nice man greeted us. He could tell we hadn't been there before so he gave us a rundown of the menu. From the different types of sausages and  toppings to the fries and sauce options, I had a really hard time deciding. 10 minutes later, I finally decided on the Kangaroo with sweet sauteed onions and jalapenos. My bf chose the wild boar with sauerkraut. We got the duck fat fries to share with the tzatziki and honey dill sauces. Next it was onto the drinks. My bf loves beer and so did the man taking our order so they had a 5 minute convo about what the best beers were. I'm not much of a beer drinker so I just asked for a cider that tasted like Angry Orchard. Once our complete order was placed, we found a bench and waited for it to be brought out to us. Not long after we sat down, the man who just took our order came over to sit with us and we had great conversation. I really love the friendliness of Canadians.  About 15 minutes later, our food comes out and it looks and smells absolutely amazing! As soon as I took a bite out of my sausage, I melted into my seat OMG it was so good! The saltiness and spiciness of the sausage in combination with the tzatziki on the fries and the cider... It really was a flavor-gasm in my mouth. My bf and I couldn't stop smiling at each other because we were in food heaven. We need a Wvrst in the States ASAP!"}
{"text":"Great Beer Hall that serves game meat sausages and fantastic duck fat fries. Extremely filling with your choice of two dips if you buy a large. I had their wvrst sauce and rosemary/maple along with a kangaroo sausage."}
{"text":"Not many places have bourbon and jäger on tap, this place does.  Their sausages: are all natural, no fillers or organs, no by-products, not mechanically separated meat, and no growth hormones. And you can definitely taste it, this had to be the best sausage I've ever had. It tasted so good.   Also got the duck fries which were amazing. I have a weakness for everything condiment and dipping sauce, and we got two dipping sauces and ask our server for his two favorites, so we got Maple/Rosemary (sweet) and Chipotle (spicy w/ Sriracha) and they were amazing, and at that point icing on the cake.  Would go back anytime looking for some lunch around downtown Toronto, dinner, or after dinner drinks."}
{"text":"Was REALLY excited to visit this place, as I fell in love with the German beer halls I visited in Munich (long communal wooden tables, \"mas\" sized beers and plenty of sausage!) Visited for the first time during Euro 2012 (to cheer for Deutschland of course!)  WHEN YOU FIRST ARRIVE: You order at the front counter, then given a numbered sign to sit at your table. The staff will bring your food to you. And to clarify to the few complaining about the service: if you want to re-order, go up to the front to re-order food YOURSELF, or go to the side bar to pick up beer or wine. The wait staff are obviously willing to help you out, but they're mostly there to bring food and clear away dishes. The staff are friendly and work hard, so kindly remember to leave a tip at the front register.  FOOD: I ordered the traditional bratwvrst while my boyfriend had wild boar. The buns were fresh and perfectly toasted, but I found the sausage to be a bit dry, even with caramelized onions heaped on top (adding some table mustard helped.) I will perhaps try the saucier currywurst version the next time.)  Also had the plain fries which were hand-cut, plentiful and delicious, even more so with the choices of 2 dipping sauces. I've heard amazing things about the duck fat fries (which some said are \"heavy\" tasting, but nothing like you've had before.)  FACILITIES: I'm not a huge beer drinker, but my boyfriend was impressed that the bar had a posted schedule as to when the beer taps were last cleaned (which is more often than most places.) Plenty of wooden tables around, including a few cozy spots in the back, and a few in a newly opened patio.   They have a giant projection screen that pulls down at the front (blocking the kitchen view) - the placement is a bit awkward and I had a bit of trouble seeing over people's heads to watch the Euro, but I do realize that this isn't a sport bar (thankfully) so I shouldn't complain.  The bathrooms were clean, modern and tidy, and was surprised/amused to see the stalls built similarly to the ones in Munich (concrete enclosed walls, with thick doors. So soundproof, that you could drop a proverbial bomb in there, and no one would be the wiser!)"}
{"text":"Sausages are great, they're delicious when you're hungry or want a casual bite but even more delicious after you've had a few drinks in your system. When I heard of Wvrst and their variety of sausages, I had to try it. Walking up the stairs of Wvrst I was expecting a 'dine in for a few minutes or so to finish your sausage and go' type of restaurant but I was wrong. It's a cute place with tables and benches that reminded me of middle school lunchrooms but 10X cuter with christmas lights and hanging light bulbs. There was a bar where you can order your drinks and a cash to order your food which also had a display window where you can see the variety of sausages they had. Having never tried this, I ordered the kangaroo sausage topped with sauteed jalapenos and side order duck fat fries. The buttered toasted bun was a heavenly combination with the sausage which didn't taste distinctly different, it actually tasted very similar to a polish sausage and perhaps a little more sweet but the spicy jalapenos really put the sausage together perfectly. The duck fat fries was delicious, definitely not your average fry, when I took a bite, the fry was crispy (just how I like them) and I can taste a very light aroma of duck which was exactly everything I imagined it would be. After coming here, I don't know if I could ever really enjoy street meat anymore!"}
{"text":"I love Wvrst because there's not many restaurants like it in town. They have different kinds of sausages available, so you have plenty of options. I got one of the popular ones (German kind or something), and it didn't disappoint. The duck fat frites were a bit underwhelming, but since the main focus was the sausage for me, I didn't really care that much. Great atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"WVRST, pronounced verst, is a really cool giant indoor picnic hall. It was loud, fun, and boisterous. I love it.  The menu is simple and is everything sausage, but oh wait ... it's vegetarian friendly, too! Heaven. They have everything, 7 traditional beef/pork/lamb/veal ($6), 4 vegetarian ($7), 3 chicken/turkey ($7), and 9 game options including elk, duck, rabbit, and kangaroo ($9). The sausages are served either currywurst style, or on a roll. These are paired with over 30 beers ($6-$11), and regular French fries, or duck fat fries sprinkled with Maldon sea salt ($4.50-$6.50).  My party of 15 ordered everything. Everything! The standouts were the chorizo currywurst style, the guinea fowl, and the dirty duck fat fries (peppers, jalepenos, and sauteed onions topped with a WVRST special sauce).  I shamelessly ate more than half the portion and would have ordered more if I wasn't trying to stay reasonably classy in front of my friends. I was impressed with the choice of not one, but two unique dipping sauces included with the fries, a homage to traditional Belgian style frites with mayo dip. The maple/rosemary and chipotle were our favourite, sweet with a hint of rosemary while the chiptole sauce was creamy, smokey with a hot bite.  Even though I don't drink, I know this place has an excellent beer menu. Just like any self-respecting Munich beer hall, WVRST is as much about food as it is about beer. From local Toronto brews like Augusta Ale and Denison's, to European and Japanese imports, the sixteen different craft brews on tap and seventeen different bottles and cans are sure to please Toronto's serious beer connoisseurs. Staff come by to check on drinks, but I still would have preferred a regular wait service set-up more typical of a beer hall. With sausages and fries being the only two menu options, the range of combination between meats, toppings, and dipping sauces is impressive along side the styled decor and friendly staff. And most importantly, they are some mighty fine sausages.   Hours - 11:30 - 11:00, Thursday until 12pm and Friday/Saturday until 1:00pm Parking - street parking  Note: On weekends, it gets very busy, so if they reach capacity, you will still have to line up and wait, even if your group is already inside with reservations. If you have reservations, they can only guarantee entry if the entire party is present at the time of entry."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dinner at WVRST.  Our friend has celiac disease and thus, we are in search for gluten free options.  She and her fiancé chose WVRST.  Almost all of the food on the menu is gluten free with the exception of the rolls.  Ask the servers for more specifics.    We loved the atmosphere - great music greeted us as we hiked up the flight of stairs to enter the restaurant.  The space has a hip, modern, community feel.  I love the community tables too.  Food wise, they specialize in sausages, fries and accompaniments to both.  They probably won't like this description but I would describe it as high end hot dog/sausage spot.  I took a picture of the food menu so you can get an idea of their offerings.  Unfortunately, I was pretty full before walking in the door.  All I can vouch for was the duck fat fries.  My husband and I agree that the dipping sauces were phenomenal.  Between the four of us, we ordered two large fry orders and six different dipping sauces.  We really liked all of the sauces we tried - ranch, wvrst, and the jalapeño/cilantro were my favorite.  We also had a chili tomato, maple Rosemary (friends compared that to honey mustard) and a garlic sauce too.  All good and loved the serving bowls for them - reminded me of mini honey pots and Winnie the Pooh.    My friends ordered three different sausages - wild boar, venison and a pork blend.  The boys really enjoyed their beers.  The cider collection was also on point.  We didn't have enough room for dessert - maple Rosemary ice cream but, we saw quite a few tables enjoying it.  Definitely satisfied by WVRST.  Great food, great concept, great dipping sauces, great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Was really impressed by the variety of sausages that were traditional, vegan, and unconventional."}
{"text":"10 dollars for a sausage?! Are you kidding me? 9 dollars for fries?! That's crazy!! The quality of the food is darn good I'll give you that! Top quality. The sausage is the best I've ever had in my entire life in terms of the richness of the meat, and the freshness plus flavour. And the fries are fried in duck fat so it brings it a unique feel and makes them quite tasty. The staff are very friendly and polite. The environment is also very trendy. It's definitely worth trying out especially that it's not everyday you see a restaurant specialize in sausages. But after ordering drinks, be prepared to spend 30-50 bucks per visit per person."}
{"text":"My only 5 star food experience in Toronto.  Quality sausages served on a soft grilled bun, served with duck fat fries and a cold beer. The space is really nice too.   Would definitely recommend for tourists as a \"must eat\" when in Toronto."}
{"text":"If they only sold the sausages, I'd give them 4 stars. But the dirty duck fries are pretty fabulous, and it's a great space perfect for birthdays, going away parties or a large gathering with friends. They have a lot of different beers on tap, and they serve the kind of food you'll want to eat with those beers.  My girlfriend and I both got a sausage on a bun. I was tempted by the game meats, but I thought I'd try one of their cheaper offerings first before I went all in. The buns they use are great. Lovely consistency and love how they are toasted. You get two toppings for free out of (sauteed onions, sauerkraut, jalapeños, and sweet peppers). Mustard and ketchup is at the table. You can also get the sausage without a bun with curry sauce. (They do not recommend the game meats this way).  The best part of the meal was the dirty duck fries. They are fries done in duck fat so they are extra crisp, and they are loaded with all the toppings you could get on your sausage on a bun, plus the curry sauce. A reviewer said they should add cheese and make it a poutine.... But I'd be against that. It already has richness from the duck fat, and a nice acidity. Cheese would just turn it into a hot mess and would make the fries soggier. They really have something with these fries.  I'd totally go back and take all my friends there. Staff was great, food was da bomb and affordable. Can't wait to go back and try a different sausage and pound back some beers."}
{"text":"My wife and I were on vacation in Toronto and my wife found this place on Yelp and thought I would love it. She was SO RIGHT! It is a couple mile walk from the CN tower so you can work off the calories getting there.  You enter and the place is pretty expansive for a small 2nd floor establishment. Lots of long tables and my wife and I found a high table by the window. I ordered a kangaroo brat with sauerkraut and sauteed jalapenos.  I also got the IPA they recommended, (They have a great selection of beers on tap, probably 5 IPAs)  The clientele is a lot like Toronto, pretty young and kind of hipster like.  The food came about about 8 minutes later while I enjoyed my IPA and conversation. The kangaroo was very lean and the bun just wasn't a crummy white bun, this was a freshly baked roll and just added a ton to the meal. The spices were perfect for the bouncing marsupial. The toppings were done to perfection and every bite I reminded her how awesome she was for finding this place.  It was such an awesome experience and the service was perfect! Such a great place!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a casual place after work to grab a bite with some friends or coworkers, Wvrst is your place. Ordering is done up front, and you dine in a beer hall with long tables and benches.   There are many different sausages - I've tried Pheasant, Bison, and Kangaroo. All three are good. Bison is a good one to try if it's your first time and not looking to be too adventurous. Top it off with Sautéed Jalapeños and Sweet Peppers/or Onions and you've got yourself a fine sausage.   I also recommend the Dirty Fires. This is essentially a large plate of fries with peppers, jalapeños, and onions along with a special gravy, sweet-like sauce. You also get your choice of 2 dips. It's very heavy so you can definitely share along 2 or 3 people.   Their ice cream is also pretty good. You can get Duck Fry Bits added on (they're alright, you're not missing out if you don't add).   Wvrst can get pretty loud inside during peak hours which sometimes makes it hard to hear table chat. I recommend going off hours (early dinner or mid afternoon on a weekend) to enjoy it most!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this place just because the location is great and the restaurant itself is set out very well. The last time I came here was for a friends birthday of around 15 people and they were able to reserve a corner for us to have kind of a semi-private party.   I ordered the duck fat fries (delicious) and the Oktoberfest sausage with Saurkraut. The fancy hot dogs they make are, of course, a wee bit overpriced for a hot dog. But, they actually use very authentic ingredients for their meat and toppings, so it is worth to have a fancy hot dog now and again. I also really enjoyed that the place has ciders and beers and sample sizes of them. It makes it much more fun to sit around eat and drink with friends on an evening.  Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I unexpectedly visited this place today with a good friend of mine who said I had to try the sausage and the beer. I couldn't say no!   The beer selection was great, from tap to bottle or can. What was even better was the sausage selection and preparation. We decided on sharing the Octoberfest sausage with fries and everything was delicious. The bun was fresh, as was the toppings and most importantly the sausage was large, flavourful, cooked to perfection, and delicious!   I'll definitely be back very soon!!"}
{"text":"Yummy sausages of the most interesting kinds.  Awesome fries too! However, I couldn't really tell the difference between the regular and duck fat fries although I didn't try them side-by-side to come to a definitive conclusion. Highly recommend Wvrst if you're a sausage lover or even if you are just hungry and happen to be on King Street - LOL!"}
{"text":"Really fun place to go with friends, and great food/beer!   Really awesome selection of beer and great sausages!  Also highly recommend the duck fat fries!!"}
{"text":"Veru chill and casual place. Great for groups. Various types of sausage: duck, kangaroo, wild boar, rabbit and more typical ones too. Duck sausage was good with marinara sauce. Though we couldnt taste much of a difference w the duck fat fries, the dipping sauces were delicious and all made in house. Loved the truffle sauce which had lots of flavor. Wasabi miso was tasty though couldnt taste the miso.  Rosemary and maple was sweet but a little bland. Ask for a sample if you're not sure what to get."}
{"text":"Really fun atmosphere. Feels like optoberfest with the lighting and seating.  Amazing list of beers. Really fun to try new ones every time you go.  Food is decent but the duck and foie sausage is by far my favourite. I have a hard time ordering anything else."}
{"text":"After Gord and I saw a movie, we walked to Wvrst on King Street W for supper.  It's the first time I've been there ... Gord's been a couple times.  There was hardly anyone when we got there about 5pm but it filled up rather quickly.  The layout is quite simple ... rows of long communal tables and chairs and seats at the bar.  It was quite busy. People would leave and be replaced with others.  They have a lot of interesting beers, both on tap and in a bottle. I had a couple Beau's Lug Tread Lagered Ale.  You have to go order your own supper at a separate counter and pay for it there. There is quite a choice of sausages ... traditional like beef, pork and chicken, to game like duck, wild boar, rabbit and kangaroo.  I ordered a Kranjska sausage (pork and garlic) in a bun ... it was $6. Gord ordered a duck sausage (maple and fois gras) sausage and onions in a bun ... it was $9. So sausages aren't cheap. We split an order of large fries ... we had curried dipping sauce (which I liked) and black pepper and onion dipper sauce (which I didn't like). At $5.50 for fries, they aren't cheap either.  My sausage was good ... really juicy.  Gord said his was okay, not great. He liked mine better.  They give everyone a couple raffle tickets. At 6:30pm, they give away a couple tickets for the Maple Leafs' hockey game ... alas, we didn't win.  I liked it there and would go back. My big complaint is that it's really LOUD there. Gord and I were sitting across from each other and we had to practically yell at each other to talk."}
{"text":"I probably just made a bad choice with my sausage (kangaroo) because it didn't taste that great. The dirty duck fries also weren't as amazing as the reviews say it is.  I may come back in the future just because they have so many different game sausages."}
{"text":"Wiener lovers rejoice! sausages in all different mixtures are overloaded onto this menu. I'll admit I was a little overwhelmed and couldn't really decide, so I ended up getting the basic Italian and the cider flight.   I'm not the biggest fan of German style foods, (they're normally too heavy for my stomach) but for what it's worth the food was good. I got the Italian sausage on the white roll with cheese. Like I said I'm not the biggest sausage fan, but the Clark of the link was good and the cheese really added to the overall sandwich (hotdog?) vibe.   The duck fat fries were basic in their own right, but the real star of the show was the sauce. Man, I could've drank the stuff. They had a list of about 19 different sauces to choose from, but I went to with the garlic dill, because I'm one of those freaky pickle lovers. It was amazing.   The beer list was too much too read, and the pricing system was confusing so we went with the cider flights, which were attentively priced and all super yummy."}
{"text":"I was shopping at Living Lighting with my husband, and after finding the perfect pair of simple, modern sconces we left the store hungry and in search of dinner. Wvrst was right across the street so we decided to try it. BEST DECISION OF THE WEEK! Being somewhat antisocial (boo us), we avoided the long communal tables and plopped ourselves at the bar. The staff were extremely friendly and explained how to order and the menu options to us. I ordered the Oktoberfest sausage with sauerkraut and jalapeños. My husband ordered the Italian sausage. We split an order of duck fat fries. We each ordered a pint of German beer (shame on me but I can't remember what it was). It doesn't matter. Everything was delicious. Everything. Especially the fries, which I still dream about. It's one of those meals where you get halfway through and think \"omg I just COULDN'T eat another bite!!!\" and then you finish everything and undo the top button on your pants before waddling out. Don't feel ashamed. Everyone else is undoing their pants too! Next time I'm wearing stretchy pants."}
{"text":"The duck hotdog was okay. First bite was good, but then after that its just like any other sausage. Came in at 12, and there were 3 parties ahead of me in line, after I ordered there was a line of about 25 people.   Enjoy that they have a huge variety of beer and three types of mustard on the table for you."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place and thought why not after reading the menu.. interesting.  Well no disappointments here.. the food was awesome fun and the beers.. different which made this place a certain come back for sure.  Love it"}
{"text":"Good: The Oktoberfest-style bench seating makes for a pretty fun atmosphere and the Leafs game was on (without sound). It's pretty dang loud however, so it's helpful to sit next to friends rather than across from them. On the weekend, the \"background\" music negates conversation altogether, and the douchebag factor is exponentially higher.   Better: The draft selection is most excellent! But pricey. Available in litre steins for the manliest of men.   Best: Lots of different sausages, including some vegan options. It's certainly not a vegetarian's pick by any means, but it's nice that one can tag along with meatetarian friends without starving. The currywurst was lamely one-dimensional, but the wild boar sausage with sauerkraut and jalapenos was \"gamey and flavourful\" as per the boyf. Fries and dipping sauces were yummy as well.   Dollars: Two dawgs, some fries and a beer each set us back forty bucks.   Stay tuned for the upcoming taste-test showdown: Wvrst Italian sausage vs. Classic Toronto streetmeat..."}
{"text":"Their Sausages are out of this world! Plus love the beer menu!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's not just the standard pork/beef sausages, you also have the option of trying elk/bison/rabbit/kangaroo, and other game meats. I always walk out of here pleased. Also, get the duck fat fries.  Service is really quick and it's surprisingly clean for a place this busy. The wait can be long if you go in at a busy time but I've never been unlucky enough to wait longer than  a minute."}
{"text":"Stopped in at Wvrst (pronounced \"verst\" so you don't embarrass yourself) on my first official outing as a newly minted resident of Canada.   If I had been feeling homesick for Chicago, Wvrst would have cured that hunger and then some. The location is very reminiscent of Chicago's trendy northside bar scene -- exposed beams and ductwork, tiled brick, wood floors, a wall of taps -- the whole shebang. The setup inside is mainly long German Bierstube-style communal tables with bar-seating and some taller pub tables in the back. It was pretty empty inside when we popped in for lunch, but I can easily see this place being packed after work or on weekend nights.   Having no concept of what Wvrst was when we walked in, their extensive menu of sausages, house-made sides, and craft beers was a welcome sight.   We tried a tasting-sampler of a handful of their draft beers (they have 24), and did a little light reading of their beer list -- which is pretty extensive to say the least. The whole staff is also trained on their beer selections, so it was a great advantage to have a conversation with a waiter that could actually speak beereaze with us and not just repeat the menu description back to us.     As for the sausage, we went for the venison and original vegan paired with fries and three dipping sauces (maple-rosemary, chipotle, and the truffle-mushroom mayo). The sausages were full of flavor and even the vegan sausage was somehow juicy. I don't know how they managed that, but I'm a fan.   Our quick lunch ended up being a little pricier than we anticipated, but there were no regrets at our table. We've already talked about going back with some friends, so they're doing something right. They'll also accept reservations for parties of 10 or more, so we don't have to worry about splitting up our group if we feel like eating our combined weight in sausages on a busy night.    Guten Appetit!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Went there last night (Saturday at around 6pm) I haven't been there in a while, and the service was beyond exceptional (the guy at the front was probably the most professional and friendliest person), as far as the food, perfect all the way. Definitely great, also very accommodating for young children."}
{"text":"An awesome layout of long bench tables - perfect for making friends with strangers.   From a variety of sausages, to duck fat fries, to yummy circle pretzels and three pages of different drinks to order -- I honestly wanted to order the entire menu (which is rare for me!) I'm not even a sausage person compared to my spouse and I still couldn't help but want to try half the options listed.   I will be back!~"}
{"text":"It can get loud but that's all part of the ambience. The food is fantastic and they have a great beer selection. The duck wurst and duck fat fries are amazing. The staff are really friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"$40 for two beers and two hot dogs? i dont think so! i'd have my italian sausage street dog over these \"gourmet\" sausages any day.."}
{"text":"I\"m giving this place a 3 star while my husband gives it 5 stars. Why? because I don't like sausages/hotdogs and I don't drink beer. Hubby doesn't do the brew either, but he loves his meats.   I had the vegetraian meatless dog made of chick peas etc and it was excellent. Really good! But HUGE!  Hubby and a few others tried the Venison, Lamb, Kangaroo, Duck ones. They all loved it. The brews are supposed to be great. I liked my Coke just fine!   Best part are the fries. They come friend regular or in duck fat.Thick belgian cut ones. And then topped with your choice of chilies, sweet pepeprs, onions etc. We ordered duck and non duck (coudlnt taste the difference). They're HUGE and  come in a 8x10 baking tray!   The jalapenos/chillies are really really spicy, so beware!"}
{"text":"I can here a few days ago with a group of friends around dinner time on a friday evening. While this venue typically doesn't require a reservation since it's quite big and the eating area is setup as rows of picnic tables we so happened to come at a particularly busy time and had to wait 20 minutes before being let it. After struggling to find seating for 4 people for a few minutes we finally were able to grab a spot. We then had to line up to order food as the wait staff does not come to take your order. My partner and I ordered the dirty fries and vegitarian and chicken sausages. The meal came out fairly quickly. Unfortunately we were brought the wrong order originally but that was fixed quickly and without hesitation. The food portion sizes are on the small side especially for the price and may not be filling if you just order one item (depending on your appetite).  Overall this place as a great environment, very lively and the food is decent and unique. It can however get crowded and getting into your seat can be very akward. I would come back but on a less busy night.  Come here if you just want a fun place to grab a bite with a buddy. Not your typical restaurant."}
{"text":"It's like bar cafe restaurants, good decoration and relax environment. We ordered danger dog (hot dog wrapped by bacon)as in curry wvrst which is tomato curry dipping source; wild boar dog with melted Swiss Raclette cheese; duck fat fires+truffle mushroom mayo which is amazing!  You don't need waiting long time, and food will be served very quickly.  I am quite sure next drop by will in this week!  Absolutely thumbs up and 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Essentially an expensive hot dog. Still excellent food though, and the duck fat fries are great. Would recommend the normal duck fries instead of the dirty ones, as the sauce softens the fries. The duck fat is used to make the fries crunchier, and the sauce has the opposite effect.   Kangaroo meat is good, and I think you should at least try it once. Overall, would come again.  Also, a large selection of beer."}
{"text":"I tried the kangoroo sausage which was nice but nothing special. The duck fried fries sre delicious, especially with their special sauces, the mushroom mayonnaise is terrific! But the ice cream... the vanilla rose - pistachio twist, brrr, tastes like soap. My friends also tried it and they had the same opinion. That was disgusting."}
{"text":"My friends brought me here a few years ago during my first visit to Toronto. The are many different kinds of sausages and I wanted to try them all! I forgot what I had but remembered that everything we ordered tasted really good. The dirty duck fries were also very good. Will return!"}
{"text":"I've popped into to this place a couple of times. Good casual vibe and a great selection of sausages. I recommend the duck sausage.  Do find the place overpriced for the food you get but it is really tasty. They also have a large selection of beers"}
{"text":"My go-to on King St downtown with an amazing array of sausages including wild boar, rabbit, etc...which are all amazing. The duck fat fries are probably the best in the city. Selection of beer is always changing and pairs well with whatever you might order for food. Communal seatings makes for a great experience as well."}
{"text":"I guess the term \"meat market\" would be appropriate here. In a good way! All I'm saying is that I mouthed the phrase \"how you doin\" across the bar and it worked! (and it was a BAD hair day too. No make up...you get the picture).   VIBE  1. I'm not 24 anymore so to wait in line as a solo for 20 minutes to get into a beer hall? Come on.  2. It wasn't that balls to the wall. They played the hockey game in here and it's a good boisterous loud energy.  Exactly what you think a Toronto version of a beer hall would be. Conservatively rip-roaring.  3. I really like the subway tiled walls and the font displaying Wvrst. Smart!  4. It's a great set up: communal blonde wood tables, a place to order the sausage in the back and a bar on the side. Plus, smaller tables for smaller parties if you don't like the long table vibe. Smart design!  5. It's very late twenties here. I like it! There are a few cuties here too. It's great if you are in a group. I wouldn't come on a date here, however. Unless you want your date to leave you!   I ATE/DRANK I was fed pilsner. You can also get some mighty steins. It's pretty cool.  I was also hungry, so I had the traditional bratwurst. It was good! The bun was fresh and toasty and they don't skimp on the sausage. It's a good deal for about $6-7.  I was eating someone else's fries. I wish I got them! The sauces to go with the fries were tempting! Though I did wish they had sauces for the wurst. That's just me though.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  I'll have to come back for the curry wurst and more fries. If only to satisfy a good friend of mine in Berlin.  Group date?"}
{"text":"Beer and sausages, you can't go wrong! They have duck fat fries and experts who help you pair your meat with your beer. They even have beer on cast. Try beers that you usually don't drink, trust the staff they will not steer you wrong. Urthel Hopit and saw dust city's American wheat is a must try."}
{"text":"when the sausage craving hits, I make a beeline to wvrst.  everything is good here -- sausages, non-sausage dishes, beers, service and décor.  i like sausages, but I'm not sausage crazy.  if I was, this place would be an easy 5 stars."}
{"text":"How awesome is it to see a restaurant packed to the brim on a Monday night? I love Toronto for that reason - a weekday night shouldn't be wasted at home. Guys - the food is amazing here. There are tons of sausages for everyone (game meat, normal meat, vegetarian!), and top it with anything you'd like. I'm not going to tell you what to do here because honestly - everything looked and smelled amazing - I don't think you can go wrong here.  The price is right as well - an order of duck fat fries to share and two dogs on a bun = ~$24. I'm not a big fan of beer, but for those beer aficionados - there seemed to be a lot on tap.   If you're looking for a quick, cheap meal - Wvrst will leave you happy and full."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Wurst:  -The sausages are some of the best I've had *Bison is my favourite -Currywurst vs. bun option is nice for a gluten free/bread hater crowd -DUCK FAT FRIES!!! *yes, it's worth spending the extra buck for this option -Dipping sauces for fries are amazing & some of them totally unique -Nice selection of actual German beer that is otherwise missing in these parts  Additionally, the atmosphere is super fun - decor is the closest to a hip NY spot I've seen in Toronto, the music is better than most places in the city and the staff are friendly & chill.  The only reason I'm not giving it a 5th star is because it's so bloody loud in there when they're packed you can't have a conversation with the people you're sitting with. Some acoustic treatment on the ceiling would help this greatly."}
{"text":"Not the best place for picky eaters or vegans, but the concept is amazing as is their beer selection. One of few places in the city to get some proper aged beer if you can afford to splurge."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. The value is questionable and the ambiance is very, very loud.  The good: - The sausages are outstanding - The kraut is very good - The duck fat fries are outstanding - The regular fries are good - There is a very very large beer selection  The bad: - The beer selection is vast but much too expensive. $9 Stiegl? No thanks.  There are a few local beers that were reasonably priced at $6.5/$7 but generally the beer prices were exorbitant.  - The beer selection is vast but there weren't TOO many things I was actually interested in on the list. - The large portion of fries/duck fries for $5.5/$6.5 were small compared to the price (but excellent). - We tried 4 dips with our two orders of fries (maple rosemary, wvrst, chipolte and garam masala) and no one liked any of them (actually, 1/4 people liked the wvrst and 1/4 liked the chipolte). - The order process was confusing.  I'm unclear if you can get beer from the sausage counter or not.  I got beer from the bar and food from the food counter and it was sort of a pain since the bar didn't really have any semblance of a line.  - It is VERY loud; this is probably by design [in the style of open beer hall] but I wouldn't really count this as a positive - the night we were there there weren't any obnoxiously loud parties or people but if there had been, they would have carried throughout the entire open room and it would be very annoying.  Overall, I would be happy to eat here again but I still think the prices for the fries and beer are too high."}
{"text":"Sausage/beer hall! You get a wide variety of sausages to choose from (kangaroo, wild boar, venison, bison etc) along with a huge list of beer. Iv had the wild boar and bison wuth duck frites. Delicious! The biggest problem (which is also a testament to their popularity) is that it can get packed really fast! Maybe as a date it would be fine but a party of 4+ it would be challenging to find a table next to each other."}
{"text":"HOLY HELL!  My friend was visiting from Germany and seriously missing German food so I ended up finding this place here on Yelp and we went during our American/Canadian road trip I was taking her on. I was thrilled to see that they had vegan options for the brats and even the dirty fries. I got the tofu and sweet basil brat with jalepenos and rosemary garlic mayo with vegetarian dirty fries and a pumpkin beer from Great Lakes Brewing! Absolutely delicious and seasoned perfectly. My friend got a pork brat and the duck fat fries and really loved it. Can't wait to go here again next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"We had the elk and pheasant sausages with the duck fat fries and everything was delicious! Really cool atmosphere. Beers are very pricey though so we didn't end up getting any"}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place, from the food to the atmosphere. I have to admit, I was initially put off by the beer hall-style seating (aka long benches). It took a while to find enough space for three people and we had to ask a small group to make some room on their bench so we could squeeze in - needless to say they did not look happy. But by the end of our meal we got some great travel advice from the couple beside us who overhead the Mr and I talking about our next trip, and that made the experience more friendly and homey.  I ordered the beef and coriander sausage as currywurst, with a side of dirty duck fries and a glass of Dieu du Ciel. The beer selection is on point - I love seeing Quebec craft brews on a menu, and the selection of local and European beers was excellent. The sausage was divine - exceptionally flavorful even under all of that currywurst sauce. The sauce was subtly sweet, a bit on the salty side, with a mild curry flavour - very pleasing. The duck fat fries were outstanding - so good, in fact, that the group beside us ordered their own serving after smelling our fries and seeing us wolf them down. I would go back just for those fries...who am I kidding, I would try every sausage on that menu too :D"}
{"text":"Wvrst is the BEST! We got here right before the after work rush so the place was mostly empty. We sat at the bar so we could look at the large beer selection and the rest of the place was filled with long hall tables. We went with a flight to try a few things and ordered some bratwurst. The food and beer were all amazing. Lots of stuff we had never seen before. The staff were awesome and knowledgable. Once the placed filled up, and it did quickly it was a cool vibe."}
{"text":"Wow! We stumbled across this place while in Toronto from Rochester, NY. We loved it! We loved the vibe, the menu, the concept, and the prices. We sat at the bar, where we could order drinks and food right from the bar. I got the chicken, artichoke, basil sausage and my husband got the venison sausage. Both were great, well presented, and so well priced. We split an order of the duck fat frites which were great as well. Our total bill including 2 dinners and drinks was less than $50 which is amazing in Toronto. The atmosphere is great - like a modern, German beer hall. We will definitely be returning. This place is a great find!"}
{"text":"Good food, nice selection of beer, not bad at all.  I was pleasantly surprised by the food and drink here considering the type of neighbourhood it's in. The crowd was still a very King west type, but the laid back environment helped to dissipate any residual pretentiousness carried in from the office.   Ordering is easy, you go up to the counter and make your choices (sausage, toppings, sides + sauces, drinks) and take a number to put on your table so someone can bring your order over. The food was great! I had the wild boar, and my dinner mate had a classic Italian. My sausage was super tasty, but the Italian was pretty typical. I had a taste of his, and he of mine, and we both agreed that the wild boar was the winner. The Italian met the mark, but we were a little disappointed because we expected a really exceptional sausage. But an Italian sausage is an Italian sausage. We also shared an order of duck fat fries, which were a little soft and soggy (which is how I like them!) but didn't wow either of us. The dipping sauce was good (forget which one we had) and there were plenty of fun choices to suit your whim. Plenty of beers on tap for all sorts of beer drinkers, including the giant oversized glass which took the 2 of us to finish. We wondered why his beer cost more than his food! And then we found out when the server hauled it over to our table...  It's not a place I would frequent given its location, but I'd definitely come back if someone suggested it for dinner. WVRST only gets 3 stars because I don't think it quite beat the above average mark for me, but it was a positive experience. A 3.5 at best. A great solid meal for a very good price."}
{"text":"I've been twice and will be back again, the variety of sausages are pretty awesome and require multiple visits.   Aside from the sausages though the real winner is their duck fat fried fries. They are the icing on the cake and are worthy of a visit all on their own, you pair them with one of the many dips and you're golden.   They also have quite a variety of beer more then I could even begin to list."}
{"text":"Well after running with my sister in the summer heat, we needed food. She had mentioned Wurst to me a couple times before and I told her that it was just around the corner. I brought it up on my phone and mentioned to her that the dessert is salted maple rosemary ice cream. Well that sealed the deal. This is one of the reasons she runs...the guilt free ice cream follow up. For, it's beer...and Wurst's tap list is pretty good and they boast a pretty nice bottle list too. They even post on their web page when they last cleaned their lines. Very nice.  Of course, those two things are bonuses, because you come to Wurst for the sausages. I really wanted to have a staple like Oktoberfest or Bratwurst, but my sister asked me if I had ever had kangaroo. Well, no I hadn't, and thus my choice was made. Add to that some duck fat fries and a Mill Street 100th Meridian and I was set. The kangaroo was an interesting meat to choose and it was accented with herbs, but it wasn't too distinctive. It was nice and it tasted lean, but I can't say much about it other than it probably needed those herbs. The duck fat fries were pretty damn awesome (get these!!!) and the beer was decent.  I wanted draft and that was the best on offer. If I wasn't driving, I have been jumping into the bottles next. They have some standout breweries like Cantillon, Founders, DDC, Evil Twin, Mikkeller, Trou, and Freigeist. They're also doing casks, and starting in January 2016, bringing out the beers they've been cellaring.  There's still tons left for me to come back for; guinea fowl with cheddar/asparagus, duck with maple/fois gras, wild boar with mushroom/tea, and elk with cumin/porcini all look like standouts on the game menu. The traditional sausages all look pretty damn tasty too and they now have heritage breeds (Tamworth and Berkshire) which would be interesting to try. Another thing that really excites me is that they offer a currywurst sausage too.  If you have room, they also offer and interesting soft serve ice cream which seems to be a Toronto staple now, but they kick it up a bit by offering duck fat fry bits as a topping."}
{"text":"Duck fat fries. Get it, don't hesitate.   The sausages are pretty good with lots of sauteed onions if youre into that. A little bit pricey but it's a good place to grab some food if you're craving dogs. And don't want the typical streetmeat (but who would ever say no to that!)."}
{"text":"It has all kind of sausages and beers from all around the world. Opens till very late. Def a good place if you like sausages and beers"}
{"text":"Hmm. Had higher expectations for this place. Came here sans-reservation Thursday night with four girlfriends. There was a tiny lineup at the door and they told us twenty minutes, but it ended up being around just three or so. Sweet. Walk in to see beautiful string lights imitating the night sky and rows of long picnic benches. Busy, busy - this place is packed. Lack of seating for 5.   Communal seating is not my favourite style. I will try to avoid busy hours or go with a small group if that's the case. I go to eat to speak with my friends, not strangers. Certainly an efficient structure for business and I'd imagine it appeals to some for the 'trendy' factor. But not so fun. A staff member was able to usher some groups around so there was space and we squeezed in. Lots of uncomfortable bumping and elbow action. Lack of room to hang our coats and bags (this would work better on a summer day) and the scarce existing coat hangers were overflowing. I had to balance my long winter jacket in my lap and place my bag in the cramped space underneath me. Despite this, the place still looked pretty neat. Organized chaos is how I'd describe it. Works, though. Atmosphere was pretty top notch, excluding the squish and inconvenience.   What else I don't like: self service. Good that they bring the food to you. But lining up cafeteria style to give your order? Not my thing. Also the entire process feels a lot longer. The line up was long too, close to ten minutes if not more.  Ah, now the food. I split the $24 Barese wvrst for two (pork, herbs, garlic, cheese?) with a friend. It was average. Meat was slightly a bit too fatty for us, a little greasy. I enjoyed it, but it was getting a bit too fragrant and strong at the end and we couldn't finish it. It's a decent size for two small eaters or one heavy eater. Food took fifteen minutes to come out. I wish I had picked game on a bun.  We were able to choose one side with it, which I was under the mistaken idea that we could order fries. They meant one side for the meat: pickled vegetables etc - so we got the sauerkraut. Nothing special. The country bread was not up to par. The crust was almost inedible and super hard, but it had soft middles - generally pretty plain in taste. Tried the dirty fries with the tamarind sauce - it was decent, I suppose the tamarind gave it an interesting kick but it wasn't really my thing. Overall, food was generally disappointing. Value was okay, but not for the dish I ordered.  Trendy and pretty insides, but I'm not in a rush to go back."}
{"text":"Very mediocre. The atmosphere is charming but the sausage was dry and fairly boring.(not to mention charred in certain spots). The fries were fine but nothing mind blowing. This place is another part of the King Street Curse, where location gets you patrons."}
{"text":"A gazillion sausages and beer... what more can you ask for? Great spot for after work drinks.. Definitely a Yuppy hotspot. Usually go for a Duck Fat Fries, extra dirty! Skip the bread and do their curry wurst if you want to change it up. Great craft beers on tap with lines that are cleaned regularly! Got some good barley wines and local bottles available too. Call ahead though for seats - Place gets cray."}
{"text":"Cool spot to munch on some sausage dogs and drink beer. They had a good amount of beer on tap. My brother ordered duck fat fries and they were delicious. I ordered chicken sausage and it was good too. I was too afraid to try a different type of meat I've never have eaten before just in case my stomach couldn't handle it. This spot could be nice for a date or a night out with friends. It could probably get crowded and loud but when we visited it was almost empty and quiet."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, great drinks.  Communal seating, order at the cashier and grab a seat with your number, they will come and serve you your food and drinks. Or you can go to the bar to grab one yourself. The bison sausage was delicious and they have a great selection of beers."}
{"text":"Came here with a beer friend I have in the area. He feels that this is one of best places to come to downtown and I would have to agree.  The sausage selection is simply out of this world and their beer selection is top notch for the area.  It wasn't too busy when we went so we got to sit at the bar and enjoy some good beers and sausage. If I am back in the area I am definitely stopping by."}
{"text":"I arrived at Wvrst around 1PM on a Tuesday and it was kinda empty. The atmosphere was very cozy and unique, the stylish decor and seating gave the place a more interesting and cool vibe.   The two main factors of why I came to Wvrst are its \"Game\" variety of meats and award-winning Duck Fat Fries.   I enjoy trying new things, so I tried Kangaroo with sweet sautéed onions. From what I heard, Kangaroo meat is dry and it actually was dry when I tasted it. Although, it was still a decent-tasting hot dog.   Would I go for another round of Kangaroo? Probably not. I kinda chose Kangaroo because it seemed really unique to eat and the fact that I could now say I ate Kangaroo.  The Duck Fat Fries tasted pretty good, but I expected the taste to be more outstanding due to its award-winning status.   I would most likely come back due to its atmosphere and to try its other unique meats, possibly Duck.   Also, it feels nice that I ate at a place where a scene from Suits was shot."}
{"text":"I'm a little late to this sausage party with my review, but  here goes... Typically, I'm not one to indulge in the carnal sins of sausage, but seeing that I'd planned an event involving the beefy visuals of the film Magic Mike, it only made sense to finish said event with face time involving real hot meat!   WVRST is a beer and sausage drink-a-teria for lack of a better description.  It's three or four looong rows of picnic table style communal tables.  You place your order at the front desk where the uncooked sausages are on display in a showcase and you take a number sit back down at your table and wait for the staff to bring it up to you.  My hubby was dissappointed that the girls working here weren't wearing those ridiculous Tyrolean outfits  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmGjaqi74qo  but I'll say the girls at WVRST aren't at all bad looking.  Truthfully, I am not a fan of sausage or hotdogs as I don't consume pork.  I was initially pegged to order the veggie dog, but upon seeing and savouring the aroma of Chris P's artichoke/chicken decided to order that instead and it was the best sausage I've had!!! Nicely seasoned and neither too hard (and charred) or too limp!  The bun that encases the weiner is soft and pleasantly chewy,and the sauteed saurkraut and peppers was the perfect accompaniment to the meat package.  Thanks to Kris, Johnny, and Chris for letting us dip into, if not ravage their decadent duck fat fry reserves, fries do taste better when they are Bogarted off someone else of course!  Good to know: For those who are squeamish at the thought of pork and game, WVRST also serves vegetarian sausages which are tofu based and uses bread  instead of casing to solidify it's \"sausage-esque\" shape.  Also if you're not a beer drinker WVRST has a selection of refined sodas from Boylan and Belvoir fruit farms.  Big up to whomever puts together the musical playlist here as I had an earful of welcome proper oldschool  rap tunes from the likes of EPMD and Eric B & Rakim to chill with, while I enjoyed my sausage.  A big thank-you to all those who showed up to get a banger in the mouth and special thanks to WVRST staffer Stephanie for reserving the sexy corner table for our 'Sausage Party\" and I will definitely be returning here to update on the veggie banger."}
{"text":"I love the communal tables. Yes, communal tables so you'll probably have to sit next to a stranger but you could make a new friend.   I got the bison sausage and I was pleasantly surprised at how flavorful it was. It was a toss up because bison is lean and when not cooked right it can become tough. This was really good. I topped my sausage with onions and peppers then smothered it in spicy mustard and went to town. I was very happy. Of course we ordered Duck Fries to share and they were good. I think normally they're great but we went in the evening and I think the oil needed to be changed. The fries weren't golden, but rather a dark brown almost black color. They were still good but we didn't finish them.  The beer selection was good and they have wines for those that opt to pair wine with sausage. The service was also good. Pretty chill place."}
{"text":"After 533 reviews I'm sure you're expected to see something different at this point right?  Well...probably not, I think I'm going to say the same thing that just about 500 other people have said about this place so go ahead and skip this...I'll wait....  k, we good?   The beer was really good I ordered a cider that I can't remember the name of because I ended up going somewhere else after this place because everything was out of my price range. But I can recall some things after getting so wasted from the night before to tell you that they have big giant sign that tells you when they clean the beer lines and even date it in big font so you can see how clean they are!.......... NO COMMA'S IN THAT PARAGRAPH FOLKS! Try and do it all in one breath hahahah  My girlfriend ended up getting \"The OKTOBERFEST\" which is the pretty much standard for \"I don't want to try something I'm not going to like so I'll keep it safe and eat something that relates closest to a hotdog in the microwave\" sausage. She also got a beer called \"Granite\" to help wash the taste of the German motherland down her gullet.  Overall (from what I remember) we had a great time, the place was clean, the service really fast, the staff were really nice and informative and the atmosphere was fun. The only downside is the prices of everything, but considering they are in the downtown core of Toronto I can kinda understand, The beer they have isn't exactly sold at the corner LCBO too. At the end of the day what can I say I'm a cheep drunk folks and this kinda place just isn't for my kinda people, but if you're visiting the city make good bread working for...lets say... Kevin O'Leary or something then this place is for you! or just bald men...Look at the photo section it's pictures of yummy food yes but it's all bald men, with newsies hats hahaha.  Cheers homies"}
{"text":"Lots of beer selection and sausage selection. Some pretty unique ones. Would definitely recommend trying it out.   Found a new favourite beer. I'm sure there is something there for everyone. Had the wild boar and the duck fat Fries were delish.   Don't think I would crave for this place though."}
{"text":"It was the best of times, it was the wvrst of times...  Stopped into WVRST for a late lunch on a Friday afternoon.  I was immediately impressed by the decor - bright red subway tiles, long communal tables and benches, romantic strung light bulbs.  We placed our order with the cashier:  - Currywvrst style Boerewors ($6) - Kangaroo sausage on whole wheat bun with carmelized onions and saurkraut ($9) - Large order of duck fat fries (maple/rosemary and garlic chive dips) ($6.50) - Cherry soda  We grabbed a table by the window and soon our order was brought to us.  The currywvrst was really just one sausage sliced, with curry flavor tomato sauce on top and came with one piece of bread on the side.  I didn't know what to do with the bread, so I folded it in half and made a little sausage sammy with it.  The kangaroo sausage was more impressive...the bun was large, soft and fresh tasting.  It was stuffed with the onions and saurkraut leaving no room for condiments, not that it needed it.  The large order of duck fat fries was almost too big for two people, albeit very delicious.  I would consider getting the small portion next time.  The garlic chive dip was by far better than the maple rosemary.  I just didn't care for that combination.  Had a look at their beer menu and although an impressive selection, a tad on the expensive side with pints between $7 to $10.  Our meal totaled $30 including taxes and tips for our order delivery guy."}
{"text":"A whole lotta sausage.  A whole lotta beer.  Little to none service.  Oktoberfest table set-up with dim lighting.  Eat Game meat, it's delicious- Wild Boar is my fave.  Dirty Duck Fries... no. Duck Fries with Wvrst Sauce? Hells yes,   Would I come back? Yes.   oh if you are H-angry prepare to spend some money.   Beer selection good, Cider selection... pommies versus thornbury. I can live without both."}
{"text":"Excellent craft beer bar with highly knowledgeable staff and excellent bites.  Tried the pre-set flight that consisted of two IPAs, one kolsch, a gose and two I can't recall.  all wonderfull w/ their own taste profile.  We shared some duck fat fries w/ two sauces and just loved our time sitting up at the bar.  Prices seemed reasonable for the area and the place was packed on a tuesday night.  Thankfully because of the large open space, it wasn't hard finding a spot here.  Crowd seems mid 20s-mid 30s young professionals.  Look forward to going back again to try the sausage."}
{"text":"A long line did not result in a lengthy wait! While the line went all the way down the stairs, we were hungry and determined to relive our first and only WVRST experience from two years ago - and we did! With an old friend in tow, we accepted seats at a VERY bumping bar and tried some drinks and ordered our sausages! I went for the Vegan Original while my comrades went for the Oktoberfest and the Bratwvrst. I got mine with onions and sauerkraut and slathered some ketchup on it (am I monster? Maybe.) and hugged by that toasted white bun it was OHSOGOOD. The place was super loud and full of Saturday night pre-party people, but we had a delicious and hunger-depressing time nonetheless. Would continue to return and recommend."}
{"text":"I was here a few years back. It was one of the first places to do communal tables and the cafeteria style ordering system was a great take on casual dining. Was super impressed with the variety and seasoning of the sausages. I'd give it a revisit for sure."}
{"text":"At first I didn't want to eat here because I'm like gross pork and eewww kangaroo! But then I realized they have chicken sausages which are actually pretty fantastic and tasty - also the fries are really tasty and both the dog and the fries have great topping options.  Oh and there are like 7 billion beers to choose from, so yeah, it's a good place to check out."}
{"text":"If you love sausage and beer, this is the place to be. I found the prices reasonable, the uniqueness and variation of the game sausage menu great.  I had the kangaroo - very light and lean. I loved the 'fine herbs' in the sausage.  Unfamiliar with the beer choices, i asked what would run along my tastes - and their suggestion was right on the money. The washrooms were clean, the lighting was great, and it reminds me of the German beer halls I have been to.  It was a great experience. Service was great."}
{"text":"There has to be a bad line or joke here about a sausage party?  ... am I the only one? Okee then.  So Wvrst is every carnivore & beer lover dream.  Really.  A cool beer hall that has an overwhelming choice of beer and cider(we're talking easily 40+ of different types not including all the crazy bottle offering) PLUS at least 20+ options of sausages.  And I haven't even mentioned the side options either.  I've been in a few beer halls around the world and I was surprised to see this in Toronto... it's has a modern and hip edge but the focus isnt only the aesthetics.  It does bring the goods on flavour too.  A note to all... dont expect your own space, its allll communal tables and in true beer hall style, that's a good thing.  They did have probably 5 large sections just for big parties that reserved ahead of time (aka. bachelor parties or birthdays).   The menu for drinks is huge... I almost feel it's overwhelming.  They do offer flights for beer and cider.  Go for it... take my word for it and discover a brand new favourite.  Worse case I guess you could get stuck with something like raspberry beer.  The nice thing is that their flight cost is not obscene and I think its a great value. As for the food menu, you want to sink your teeth into everything if you're the type to carve meat of all kinds.  They dont just do the safe typical meats of chicken, beef, or pork.  Ohhh they do things like venison, kangaroo, bison, wild boar, and even VEGAN!  On top of all that choice, you go after some vegetables (cause I always do that... order vegetables at a meat focused place), DUCK fat fries (amen to that), and pickles!    Elk Sausage - With game meats, you never know how it is till its right in front of you.  This one was not gamey at all... no stink or tough chewiness.  The cumin flavour was nice with elk meat.  Though it was dry, flavour was quite good.  4/5   Wild Boar Sausage - Another game meat option and this one wasn't as flavourful as the Elk.  It tasted like pork with a bit more umami.  Compared to the Elk, this wasnt as dry but it wasn't as tasty.  3.5/5  Dirty Duck Fries - I love great crispy duck fries ever since I had them in UK.  So finding a great version in Toronto would be amazing.  I would say the toppings of onions, peppers, and jalapeno, and the wvrst sauce was nice but the fries didnt stand out as crispy or well seasoned.  It was a solid option but not quite the ones Ive had in the UK.  3.5/5  Small Salad - For a side salad, this is a great option and for once, a really reasonable price.  I know i know... who orders salad at a bierhalle ... I DO and I'll do it again.  I liked how it was dressed ... not too much and had a good balance of acidity.  4/5  Pickles - we got the cauliflower, garlic dill, and chili carrots.  This is a good selection that breaks out of the norm for most places.  I wouldnt necessarily pick up the same items again but I would definitely try other ones 4/5  Pumpkin Spice Soft serve - They jumped the bandwagon on it and though I didnt find a lot of spice to it, I did find it had a definite pumpkin taste to it.  It wasn't icy but it was fairly creamy.  3.5/5  Overall, I loved the atmosphere and I think it would be a great spot for a group to just hang out while enjoying some very good food.  Definitely try the game meats! you'll be surprised how tasty they really are!"}
{"text":"This is a solid place for fancy hot dog cravings - tasty, fast, and reasonably priced. Most recently I was pleasantly surprised by their service for a large team lunch. Typically you order at the counter and then find a spot in the communal seating, which is concerning when you're a large group of 20 in a popular restaurant. Thankfully when we called ahead, the staff reserved the large square table in the corner for us!   My fav combo: - Wild Boar Sausage: The mushrooms/tea give it an earthy, savoury taste and the meat itself is juicy and filling, but not heavy.  - Duck Fat Fries: soooo worth the upgrade and lovely with the black pepper or chipotle mayo  It can get a bit cramped and loud sometimes but it's part of the \"lively beer hall\" vibe that they're going for, so I enjoy it for what it is."}
{"text":"I have yet to eat here, but I have gone drinking here.  It's awesome.  It's also fairly unique. It's very clean inside with huge family style seating arrangements.  Coat racks line the walls which helps add to the atmosphere that this is just a really chill place.  Lots of different beer options.  All of which I enjoyed.  Next time I go, I'm eating."}
{"text":"Ahhhhh....Die Entdeckung der Currywurst (\"The Discovery of the Currywurst\") German street food at it's finest.   If you're not familiar with the dish \"currywurst\" then you probably have never been to Germany. Currywurst is to Germany as poutine is to Quebec. Simply put, it's a large bratwurst sliced up thinly and topped with a curry-ketchup sauce.  Wvrst, newly opened on King Street West, is the first place I have seen currywurst on a menu anywhere outside of Deutschland. It's reasonably priced too! (Between $6-$9 depending on what kind of meat you choose). It comes served with a few small slices of fresh bread.  If you don't want currywurst, you can order your sausage on a large kaiser roll with choice of toppings instead.  This place has EIGHTEEN kinds of sausage to choose from. Amazing. I tried the wurst made with chicken and chili peppers. Next time I will try some of the game meat varieties.   Food was extremely tasty and portion was adequate. The currywurst with a side of fries came to $11.50 or so after tax. Not bad at all. Chipotle ketchup dipping sauce was decent.  As others mentioned, the beer here is pricey. But since I wasn't drinking beer, I can hardly complain about it. The food was not overpriced.  The interior of Wrvst is spacious and modern. Staff was extremely attentive, we had happy people checking up on us frequently.  So get yourself to Wvrst!! Mach schnell !!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the open space and beer hall vibe with the communal tables. All of you nay-sayers to communal tables can suck it. Service was friendly and knowledgeable. I asked for recommendations for both game sausage and beer pairing and got some good advice.  For our first vist we tried two of the game sausages, wild boar and pheasant, a large dirty duck fries and two very delicious beers. It wasn't entirely worth it for the price (~$50), the game sausage entices you into thinking you'll get this exotic experience or something. Nah, it just tastes like sausage. Seriously, save your dollars and get a regular sausage.  Dirty duck fries were delicious, the large can feed four as a side. Get a small if it's the two of you.  Wvrst has a great selection of beer and I think the prices truly reflect what you get on this front. If I go back, I'd get a regular sausage currywurst style and a beer. Maybe a small duck fries if I'm really starved.  As for vibe, I wish we went on a weekday night rather than a weekend lunch because some parents don't know how to reign in their damn children. Are babysitters expensive in the GTA? Otherwise it was fairly quite before the bad parents came in. This experience was out of the hands of the staff, so my rating doesn't reflect it."}
{"text":"So many sausages. So many beers. So much good.   Everything is delicious, so we got a sampler and split everything. I'm not joking: everything is delicious. The raclette cheese was surprisingly (and delightfully!) strong, but oh so tasty. I love that there's a variety of game sausages alongside the usual fare. It's not just the German wursts, either--there's a little bit of everything.   The fries are amazing. The sausages are amazing. The sauces are...yes. The seating area can be a little loud, but otherwise, it's clean and bright and did I mention the sausages and beer? Because the sausages and beer are important.   Go. Stuff your face. Meat in delicious tube form. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This is great for younger crowd maybe not the best option for kids, cafeteria style seating. You walk up order and then have a seat and they'll bring you your wvrsts! Food was delicious!!!!! And we had one of their ice creams, I forgot the flavor I think maybe toasted coconut and it was phenomenal!! They also have a slew of beers on tap!"}
{"text":"I ate a very delicious and filling sausage here with Vivek S and was pleased with my experience.  There wasn't a line up when we ordered but it was a slow process because of all of the options available in terms of type of sausage and beer (they have a large selection of both). I just asked the friendly and cute waitress what was good and went with her recommendations. I got an order of duck fat fries with two very delicious dipping sauces as well.  The venue is really cool with huge ass wooden tables and benches in a big rectangular room. I guess this is what a sausage house looks like in Germany. I did find the service a tad slow considering it wasn't really that busy when I was there but the food was so yummy that it was forgiveable.  I would love to bring some friends here to check it out again. Not fancy eating but quite yummy."}
{"text":"I came to Wvrst after watching the Toronto episode of \"The Layover\" by Anthony Bourdain. As an avid traveler, one of my priorities is to hit up the best local area restaurants to get a taste of the city and I have to cater to professional opinion by renowned travelers such as Mr. Bourdain (great show if you've never seen it before).  That brought me to this location and boy am I jealous that there isn't a Wvrst in my hometown. Shaped like a German Beer hall with long picnic-style benches, Wvrst offers a very open space seating environment that is great with two or ten people. The beer selection that I saw behind the counter were fantastic for a restaurant of this size, getting a flight is recommended for you picky drinkers.  The real draw to this place however is the extensive selection of exotic and gamey sausages. I wish I could have came here multiple times to try them all, but instead I had to settle for three unique ones: Kangaroo, Wild Boar and Elk. With the Elk in particular, I also indulged on the Raclette cheese offering, which I've never had before. I would not recommend, not that it was bad, but it is really more about the aesthetic than the flavor when it comes with the cheese wheel. Anyways back to the meat: my favorite by far and surprising was the Wild Boar, I thought it would be extremely gamey, but actually it was quite delicious, very meaty and steak like, since it is wild I'm sure it was cooked well done for food safety purposes, which I thought really enhanced the flavor. I enjoyed Kangaroo the least as it had this poor chalky flavor that I wasn't too much of a fan of. Oh well, can't win them all. The Elk was delicious too, but did not stand out as much as the Boar. If I had to come back again (and hopefully I will get a chance to in the future) I definitely want to try the Rabbit or the Duck. Again, can't stress enough how jealous there isn't a place like this near me (I may have to take it in my own hands to open one)"}
{"text":"one of the best hotdogs i've had. bun is unique and very tasty. duck fat fries are also great. interior is very trendy and nice"}
{"text":"Plain and simple, love love love this place!  1) Best fries in Toronto. I know fries can be a very personal thing, but if you like crispy, tasty and fries with some oomph, well I'd like you to tell me a better place for such.  Beer Bistro used to be my go-to fries craving place.  This has replaced it. 2) Sausage fest! Enough said.  We tried the artisan ones, and the wild board. Tasty tasty both on a bun and served cut up with the sauce. 3) Beers! Galore!  C'mon what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Cool environment but expensive drinks. Fun night out just for the decor and something funky casual and different The self serve element is blah considering tips etc"}
{"text":"Okay, so I`m still not bold enough to try the kangaroo or rabbit, but impressed with the range of MEAT selections they have here. Pair these charred links of meat with a great selection of dipping sauces (like roasted garlic chipotle, wasabi, parm chive etc.), a sampler of beer, and the crispiest fries I`ve had in a long time, and WVRST is the place for me!  Again, I played it safe and just went with a Calabrese Pork on a bun - since I`m a fan of sour and spice, I added sauerkraut and sauteed jalapenos. You can also get the sausages on a plate with garlic bread . Beer samplers come with descriptions, which is always nice...Again, fries so crisp I had absolutely no choice but to have two orders.  Place is already very popular, and quite packed on the weekends, but will definitely be back when in the area."}
{"text":"When I watched all the suits come out of this restaurant, I was a bit worried. Am I underdressed? I was a bit relieved when I got in and saw that the tables were all benches and you order and pay at the front like regular fast food.  I got the Calabrese sausage ($6) in currywurst style (sliced and drenched in curry tomato sauce with a teeny tiny slice of toast). The sausage was a little dry, and I had way better currywurst sauce in Germany. This was too acidic and not flavouful enough.  Beyond that the service was good, people are friendly, the bar on the side and the ambiance is probably what makes this restaurant succeed. Dark inside with Christmas looking lights and loud music--everyone is good looking and happy. The bar on the side is the icing of this King West Vibe.  Maybe next time I come I'll try something less safe."}
{"text":"I went here on Wed night with a group from work. Loved the fun energetic atmosphere - music was at right level so you have to yell. Part of our group tried a variety of the more interesting game sausages:  Bison - nice sweet flavour from maple and blueberry. If you didn't tell me it was bison, I probably would notice which also tells you it isn't very gamely.  Denison - stronger game flavour (which I enjoy) with nice peppery flavour.   Wild boar - best of three so far. Earthly mushroom flavour with a tea infusion. Very juicy and balanced taste.  Duck - wow - talk about melt in mouth flavour from foie gras! A bit more crumbly compared to others but still good.  We also tried some of the curry sause - goes great with meat. Plus duck fat fries were a hit. I would suggest trying some of their spicier sauces.  In all, great place and food. Food is a bit pricier eg $9 for game sausage but loved the place. For big groups, grab the big square table!"}
{"text":"If you like good food and drinks, then this place is for you, It gets crowded and the communal picnic tables get a little awkward, so I recommend finding a seat at the bar."}
{"text":"Really liked the set-up and vibe of this place. It's like a beer hall with long, communal benches. It also has that wall of red subway-esque tiles that I keep seeing on instagram.  So I got the wild boar sausage on a bun with sauerkraut and raclette cheese (the cheese was an extra $4. was it worth it? cheese is always worth it), paired with duck fat fries with the maple/rosemary sauce. Everything was drool-worthy but just a tad too salty... still, would come here again."}
{"text":"We had the rabbit sausage, wheat beer, dirty fries and soft serve. $9 for a game sausage is somewhat pricey, and even then it seemed to not have the right seasoning to bring out any flavour. The ambience was okay, nothing great. Even with community tables it doesn't feel social but then that says something about Toronto, not the restaurant. The staff was pleasant and courteous.  This would have been a 3-star review had the duck fat not been bad. The oil or fat used to make the fries, and I believe even the fat bits on the ice cream, both had an odour like it had been re-used too many times. The two of us that ate it, felt sick throughout the day and I vomited that night and then felt better."}
{"text":"Decent and pretty uncomplicated menu.  Fine beer list.  Nice staff.  This place is more hipster than waxed mustaches and suspenders.  They have a bad habit of allowing most of the place to be reserved and since they seat you in long tables it becomes annoying to ask in to a mostly Empty place only to find there's almost nowhere to sit."}
{"text":"Great place to try something new with less conventional meats.   You order at the register and they bring the food to you. There is a self serve water station.   Boyfriend and I got the Kangaroo and Venison hot dogs ($10 each) accompanied with large serving of duck fat fries ($8) which are a must; an indulgence and unlike any other fries I have tried. Hot dogs can be customized with toppings such as sauerkraut and jalapeños and duck fat fries come with your choice of dipping sauce.   Great food, great atmosphere. (Note that music is a little loud and the beer hall type seating is more suited for large groups.)"}
{"text":"This is seriously as good as it gets for a modern day German Beer Hall.  Anthony Bourdain even said it was better than what you normally think of in terms of beer halls and after experiencing it first hand, I completely agree.    They have a wide variety of both beers and sausages, as well as ciders too, and all of their offerings are top notch.  The beers come in a large variety and they let you get a small sample beforehand to make sure it is one that you will like.  As for the sausages, you unfortunately can't sample each one, as much as I would have liked to, but you can choose from a large variety of game meats (elk, wild boar, venison, etc) or traditional sausages too and each one is mixed with a special blend of herbs and spices.  Then you need to get some of their fries too, so you can try one of their amazing sauces, like the signature wvrst sauce, which is a personal favorite.  You can also get the fries covered in wvrst sauce and topped with grilled onions and peppers too.  the only food/drink complaint that I would have is that I wished that the pretzels were a little bigger, but that is because I only wanted to eat more of them!  Also, as a tip for large groups, you should make your reservation well in advance because the tables fill up very quickly."}
{"text":"Visited on a Wednesday evening, great atmosphere, friendly and efficiently well run. Great food (had the rabbit sausage), service and although it was pretty busy it didn't feel annoyingly so. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"I was on a business trip to Toronto when I met with a couple of ladies from my home town who recommended a visit to this place. I had nothing better to do, so I took them up on it and made the trek across town to check it out. The atmosphere, if I had to give it a name, would be \"fast casual cafeteria dining\". It's not a negative description, I think: seating was exclusively bench provided by long bench tables that spanned the entire length of the loft space. Unusual, but not at all unpleasant. The lighting was warm and dim, the air comfortable and full of meaty aromas.  I had the danger dog, basically a majority beef sausage wrapped in bacon and covered in sauerkraut and sautéd onions. The char around the sausage itself was a little much for me, to be honest (thus the 4-star rating), but still a very decent gnosh. Very flavorful.  The real star of my lunch platter was the fries cooked in duck fat. They had a distinctive flavor on their own, but paired with the truffle dipping sauce, they were AMAZING. Easily some of the best fries I've ever had. The portion size was actually quite decent, too.  The beer selection was pretty nice as well with all sorts of styles, foreign and local, to satisfy the discerning beer drinker. I washed my sausage and fries down with a German witbier that had a nice floral kick to it. Very nice indeed.  The prices can be a little high, but then again, this isn't exactly a corner hotdog spot. Though I ordered a sausage, their meat selection is actually fairly large. If it grazes, they probably blaze it. Next time I'm in town, I hope to try their fabled bison burgers. Yes, they have bison here. That alone should give you a reason to stop by."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good - especially the fries with the cool selection of dipping sauces (loveee my fries and sauce). The sausages were all pretty good too - nothing outstanding but what you expect from a sausage.   Don't like that its communal seating + seat yourself. Too rammed and squished and you end up knocking elbows with your neighbour so not a comfortable meal at all. Kind just want to get in and out and if that's what I'm looking for I would rather a fast food joint or street meat...  Beer selection pretty good and prices are on the high end but not too bad."}
{"text":"WVRST is literally a sausage fest. After walking up the stairs and peering into the place, I was overwhelmed by how spacious and massive it looks. The sign says it can hold 145 persons. That's a lot of sausage being stuffed in one place.  Ordering here is straightforward. Read the menu, pick your sausage, a side if you want, a beverage etc. and then pay your bill. You get a number and you place it where you are seated. The staff are polite, helpful, and chilled out. If you're the type of diner who needs seclusion and privacy while seated, you probably won't find it here unless they aren't busy.  Must-try items: Duck Fat Fries  The turkey-chicken sausage tasted just like I imagined, it was absolutely delicious. You get 2 free toppings so I chose sweet onions and sweet peppers. I'll try other toppings and meats in the future. It was my first time ever trying duck fat fries and it was strangely delicious. The meal was fun to wait for and eat. I'd like to return here with some friends to experience Wvrst when it's busier with more ambience, probably in the later afternoon on a weekend. Based on first impressions, WVRST is the best."}
{"text":"I like the trendy beer hall style seating and decor. Sausages are prepared in a currywurst style (cut up and smothered in a curry tomato sauce) or on a bun.   Sausages are made from pretty much all the animals on Noah's Ark (Elk, Kangaroo, Rabbit you name it). The hyped up duck fat fries were not that special. I found them a bit more buttery than regular fries but I was not all that impressed by them.   Portion size of the sausage is pretty measly, especially if you pick currywurst. The beer selection is pretty awesome but not cheap."}
{"text":"Being South African, I like a good boerewors; while they serve something called boerewors, it is not at all actual boerewors. I believe it's just typical Canadian sausage. If you want to try actual boerewors, there are at least 3 places that will deliver to you in the GTA.  Besides the inauthentic sausages, one can expect a lengthy beer menu, absolutely stocked with beer $20+.  It should be noted, this is fundamentally an ok place. The food is good, beer, good selection, and service quite reasonable. The problem is that if you claim to be a beer/sausage place, you should at least serve the sausages you have on the menu and serve beer around at most, above average prices.  A restaurant for mostly well off suckers."}
{"text":"Great for food and for a wide selection of unique beers. The duck fat fries are to die for. The venue is located upstairs and it's very hip with their large and long tables, making the place feel like a German beer hall. Order your food at the back and your beers off to the right side. Come with a few friends or 30 friends, you'll all fit nicely. Bonus: The restrooms are clean too. Their beer and fries are da bomb!"}
{"text":"Animal kingdom debauchery vegetarian nightmare try fries with duck fat and jalapeno / cilantro dip"}
{"text":"How did I work in downtown Toronto and never tried this. This is a gem. So you go at the counter and order there and they give you a number and bring the food to your table. I ordered the mediterranean sausage (Yes,vegetrian) with sweet onions and jalapenos toppings. It was yummilicious. Some of my friends ordered the chicken one and some beef and everybody was in awe of the food. The next big thing is their Dirty Duck Fat Fries.Guys,if you go there and even if you are not hungry,please order this. I was literally in heaven when I ate this and I could not stop myself. The servers and cashiers were very nice and helpful too. One of my friend wanted to change to dirty duck fat fries (after seeing our reactions) after she already got her food.They were so nice and did it without any hesitation which we highly appreciated and did not even charge her extra. DEFINITELY going there again."}
{"text":"Selection of beer and sausages are outstanding and the most creative I have seen. Wvrst offers traditional sausages, vegetarian, chicken, and \"Game\". Traditional sausages...to someone like me who does not fancy sausages often also looked like creative sausages - which is what \"Game\" sausages are.   I had the duck sausuage on a fresh toasted bun with jalapenos and onions. Size was average, not very large, not too small. Also ordered a small duck fat fries on the side...which was HUGE for a \"small\" size. The fries were similar to Five Guys' fries (which uses peanut oil). I am a huge duck fan but did not see the hype with duck fat fries. I would prefer the peanut oil fries anyday.   Beer selections were extensive - did not make out any of the names except for one of the micro brewers form California. They have selections from Canada, USA, Japan (might have missed some).  Servers were friendly and helpful if its your first time. Definitely would come back to try kangaroo or rabbit sausage."}
{"text":"Holy moly where there a ton of different options. I decided to ball out since I knew I'd only have the opportunity to go once before I left town. Food was delicious, but I don't know if that was all the duck fat talking.  I ordered the Duck sausage, paired it with a small duck fat fries, and also got a beer. This ran be nearly $30 with tax I believe. Don't shy away just because of this though, but keep it in mind! Personally, I want to come back and try at least four more different types of sausages, and some dirty fries. The fries plus sausage combo is filling, so don't worry about needing to get more food.  Inside, it kind of feels like a cafeteria in terms of there being long connected tables that you can sit down and eat at with your friends. When you order, you're given a number stand and the food will be delivered to wherever you decide to sit. Only reason I docked it one star was because it felt a little pricey, and that's coming from someone living in SF.  Totally coming back the next time I'm in the city though, that's for sure."}
{"text":"How can I resist a Sausage Feast?!   Wvrst has all these selections that can make a female that wants to try out everything on the menu feel so lost!   So I just go with the first thing in the menu... traditional? Bowerewors? How to pronounce that? Currywvrst? Curry and tomato sauce with my sausage sounded good? Great for sharing since it was all chopped up into bite size pieces.. but will my yelp friend share with me?  Game? I am always Game... but Rabbit... will it taste like rabbit? or just taste like chicken? how about Kangaroo? Oh Duck with Foie Gras! Why am I eating Wild Boar that's taste kind of like pork??   Fries in Duck Fat?! Smokey delicious Belgian Fries.. and all these choice of dipping sauces?? Rosemary and Maple sounded great.. Yelp Friend whatever, you decide!   For the Beer... 16 drafts!! and 16 in bottles!! Some German and Belgium beers that I would love to try... PBR brought back memories since that's my father's choice of beer.. oh but I want to support the local breweries too.... My Grand River Galt Knife Lager really hit the spot on this hot 30C+ afternoon!  So I thought sausages are simple food... Wvrst changed everything...  And so many beers to try... They should definitely have a beer tasting offering... Do you hear me!! I want to TASTE everything!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and the concept is unique. We've been here countless times and our only complaint is perhaps the noise level (and that's because it's busy). The service is great. It's also a family type of place in the afternoon/early evening- there's a variety of clientele. There's usually a line to get in and I am pleased to say that no cutting is allowed- it makes me want to come back again and again."}
{"text":"Came here based on Anthony Bourdains the layover. Sat at the bar which apparently isn't heard of. Bartender was awesome gave us great suggestions about Toronto and was so knowable about the beer.  He also let us taste ones that were questionable. Duck fat fries are a must and they have like a dozen dipping choices."}
{"text":"Above-average sausages; great fries; solid draft beer selection."}
{"text":"Not a bad layout, lots of room for large groups (10+). The place was a bit loud but tolerable. The Bison sausage was pretty good, but caution adding jalapeños - pretty hot!   They've got a pretty cool concept \"sampler\" of 6 different beers in small glasses. Not a drinker anymore, but I love the idea (speaking as a former drinker hah)."}
{"text":"4 of my girlfriends and I found ourselves here on a Friday evening because we were craving some meat... and in particular, sausages. It's a very chill kind of place, kind of set up like a cafeteria with long tables and benches, so what you are supposed to do is place your order at the counter and then pay, after which servers will bring your food to your seat. They have a very interesting menu, with lots of exotic meats: kangaroo, guinea fowl, pheasant, wild boar, rabbit, bison, elk, duck with foie gras, etc. It's a carnivore's dream come true! I ended up getting a kangaroo sausage which has fine herbs in it and topped off my order with sweet peppers and sauteed onions. TBH some of the other sausages (i.e. duck with foie gras, maple and blueberry infused bison) sounded more appealing to me, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try kangaroo meat. ... I thought it was okay, it definitely tasted different from like beef or pork or chicken so it was kind of an interesting experience, but it wasn't like a standout sausage for me. It was also $9, and quite honestly I would have been just as happy with my $3 street meat - but that's just me.  This would also be a beer lover's paradise, because they have sooo many unique beer options on tap. I had a Paulaner for $8, which is a German lager. You know it's legit when your German friend gives it his seal of approval, as they are quite particular about their beers over there.  My friends and I also split a small order of the duck fat fries and the dirty duck fries, which comes topped with jalapenos, peppers, onions and WVRST special sauce, which kind of tastes like curry. The sauce on the dirty duck fries was too spicy for me, so I didn't eat too much of it. I quite liked the duck fat fries though - the duck fat really does make them more fragrant, and they are salted quite a lot but I still enjoyed them.  This is a pretty cool place to chill with your friends after work or something, because the environment is just so casual and laid back. I will say that the setup can be a bit confusing for a first timer though. The guy working at the front was not that helpful at first - he told two of my friends who arrived first that he couldn't seat us until our whole group was present, then made two of us who arrived later wait out in the corridor even though our friends were inside. Then he tried to direct us to a table who had just gotten up to go and place their orders, which resulted in us standing around awkwardly and all confused. Other than that minor struggle, everything else was cool though. Sausages and beers on a Friday night, what else could a girl ask for? I wouldn't mind coming back to try some other sausages."}
{"text":"Great hot dogs  love the pickled apps. It's fast and friendly. Usually pretty busy. Great beer selection"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our visit here.  Lazy Sunday dinner out and stopped in here.  The veggie sausage option didn't stack up to the meat but the fries were very tasty!  Lots of beers to chose from and Biylans for non alcoholic fan."}
{"text":"Always helpful happy staff here. Great draft beer list and a splendid place to enjoy an indoor lit picnic when its winter in canada. Stopped by Monday afternoon and it was not really busy. Duck fat fries with dipping sauces and mayonnaise are worth going here for, but luckily everything else is amazing here too."}
{"text":"Definitely found a new favorite spot to visit whenever in Toronto! .Wish we had this place in london ontario! . Absolutely love the atmosphere! . Definitely has a German beer hall feel to it! . A great selection of sausage!.Love the game meat! .I had the kangaroo sausage and it was amazing!  Best sausage ever! .The duck fat fries were perfect! .Service is super friendly! .The craft beer choices are awesome! .Was like a kid in a candy store! .My favorite was from the bellwoods brewery! .Can't wait to return! Definitely 10 out of 10! .Highly recommend trying them!"}
{"text":"This is one of those spots I take friends when they're visiting. I understand not everyone is obsessed with duck fat fries, but there are plenty of other options. Like really out there options.  Having so many options (wurst + fries + dipping sauces) is either going to be super exciting or stress you out.  It's a great spot for groups, since the seating is long tables and everyone orders food and drinks separately. No hassles with sorting out bills at the end of the night.  It can be a bit much (and a bit loud) when it's crowded. Off-peak is key to the optimal experience here."}
{"text":"Fantastic idea for a bar/ restaurant!  You can either walk up to the counter to order, be seated and have them bring it, or sit at the bar for service there.  The menu is mainly all different kinds of sausages, ranging from pork, to veggie, to rabbit.  Different types of fries and several different sides round it off, with a nice selection of beer on tap.  I can see it getting mobbed on  a weekend night, but fortunately during the middle of a weekend day it wasn't bad.  Big open area, not at all intimate.  Lots of wood, nice vibe, very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"It's funny, I thought already reviewed this place as it is one of my favorite places for after work beers and a simple meal.  The beer garden theme is great, and makes for a very lively, fun and social environment. They have a great selection of beers, many on tap and PBRs by the liter for a great price (they serve Anchor Steam beer, though not on tap, which is hard to find here), and even better selection of brats. They have about 20 different kinds of bratwursts, with a good selection of game and exotic meats (and a couple veggie options). You have choice of having it served in a bun or chopped up with curry sauce with a side of toast (Curry Wvrst). Both are good, but the bun is more satisfying as the bun is a really good artisan-type bread. You could order your wvrst with a side of fries which you have it fried in duck fat or served dirty style (with curry sauce and grilled onions and peppers), or both. As much as I love duck and the succulent fat of it, I didn't find much difference of the duck fries over their regular fries. However my favorite is their dirty fries. Their curry sauce is very tasty -- it was a little sweet, a little spicy and tangy.   I tried the rabbit which was nice, the Turkish lamb with Harissa which was okay, but my favorite was the duck with maple and foie gras. You do get little hits of rich buttery foie gras which is so good.  Having a Wvst alone makes a decent snack, but for a meal I suggest ordering a side of the dirty fries. And definitely have it with a couple pints."}
{"text":"Very expense for a regular hot dog. Nothing special in my opinion, very crowded, too noisy."}
{"text":"This place is set up exactly like a German beer hall. You'll know what I mean if you've ever been to Munich around 10pm except this place is much less crowded & bunched up!  In order to be properly served here you have to order first, then go take a seat or just go straight to the bar where they'll be able to do everything for you.  Definitely the best sausages in Toronto and everyone is super friendly.  All attentive and efficient to expedite how quickly you get your order.    Everything tastes \"good\" at wvrst and it's definitely a fun experience trying out all the different meats on their menu (trying out a few won't get you fill). If you're looking for a drink, there are plenty of options too. To be honest, nothing has really stood out to me and even though I've tried four or five different meats, I can't remember any of them being that distinct.  Pretty sure I tried the Kangaroo though haha.  The atmosphere is very chill and casual. Long, shared benches, and great natural light from outside during the day!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING - do you know how difficult it is to find a place in the winter that does veggie dogs? Boy was I thankful when I found this place!  First off, the entire atmosphere is super outgoing and friendly - the seating is all picnic benches to encourage people to sit with others they don't know to interact with others (I'll admit, I'm pretty shy, so I didn't do that) but the hot dog (or, rather the veggie dog) was so good! They have an ENDLESS amount of toppings (whether you like the traditional ketchup/mustard/relish, or if you're an onions/cheese/sauerkraut kinda guy), as well as buns and dogs. The reason why it's only 4 stars instead of 5 is because me and my partner were a little underwhelmed by our alcohol choices, but next time we'll be sure to just try another one instead."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for my birthday dinner. Had a party of 25 but they were super accommodating with the space and reservation. I thought the reservation service was also very easy to deal with as they send you a pdf that you can send to all your friends to let them know the reservation details.    The atmosphere at Wrvst was awesome -- bar on one side, food ordering station at the next wall over. It made the ordering process a lot easier, instead of having the regular hassle of someone taking all the orders and going back to the kitchen. However, with that also comes the line up during busy times.. which took almost 15 minutes for some people to order and another 15 to get their food.   However, the sausages and beer were a delectable combination! I had the bravrust and shared with someone who had the venison. Both were super scrumptious and went well with the dirty duck fries they had there. Everyone else really enjoyed the sausages too. Be aware, the japalenos are fresh and super spicy. It definitely has a kick but a bit too much for my liking.   If I wasn't in such a rush to get my dinner party in and out by 1 1/2 hours, I would have definitely given this place a 5 star. It has a really chill and loud atmosphere.. the Leafs game was on in the background which a lot of the people in my party enjoyed.   Definitely a great place to host a large party if you are looking to have some fun and to enjoy some sausages!"}
{"text":"If you have a love for hotdogs and different kinds of meat like kangaroo then this is the place to be.  You can have bison, elk, rabbit and more.  Also their duck fat fries are the bomb dipped in honey rosemary dip which was also quite delish.  Great place for food, beer and hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"First of all, reading some of the other reviews that rated it lower because they don't like sausages, you make me want to facepalm. It's called WVRST, practically wurst... which means sausage. That's like going to a sushi restaurant and rating it not so good because you don't like sushi. It just doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  So far I've been here twice now. I love the novelty of it. It's got a pretty interesting array of game meat sausages so if you're one of those people who have a meat bucket list (like I do), this place is perfect to scratch some of those weirder meats off your list.   It has a pub chiq atmosphere with communal tables and lively environment. If you're looking for a romantic private dinner, this is definitely not the place. When it gets packed it can get pretty rowdy and loud. In fact, the first time I went, there was an actual bouncer at the door letting people in and out to manage the space inside because it was so packed (this was during the late evening). If you go during the earlier times of the day it's much quieter.  Service is nice and friendly and helpful. If you ask them they can help you choose a beer pairing for your sausage that will compliment it nicely. They have a really nice beer list. I'm not a big beer fan so I opted for the cider. I have to give props to the bartender who was super friendly and upbeat!  For sausages that I have tried:  Wild Boar - I was excited to taste this because I've always been told wild boar is the king of the game meats. It was pleasant and had a mild sweet taste compared to other gamier meats. If you don't like a strong gamey taste, this would be a good pick.  Kangaroo - This was very gamey and quite lean. I personally love gamey meats so this was very nice for me. It is well spiced too.  Elk - By far my favorite. The cumin in the seasoning just sets this sausage off so well. It is more gamey than the Wild Boar but not intensely so. It also has this mild hint of mushroom taste that I found interesting.  The Duck Fat Fries: I don't know if there is any taste difference between these and their regular fries but they are some really really really damn good fries. I recommend the garlic and chives dipping sauce or you can do it the Belgium way and just get the plain mayo. I found the salting to be a little inconsistent on them as the second time I ordered these, they were really salty. Still very good despite that.  This isn't a restaurant I will go to regularly, but it's novelty is definitely great to share with friends who want to eat a little on the adventurous side."}
{"text":"Tried getting in one night but it was super busy so had to try again. Second time we came it wasn't as busy. Tried the kangaroo, boar and elk. The kangaroo tastes a bit bloody, not too sure how else to describe it. The elk was probably my favorite. Also tried the Rosemary ice cream with duck fat fries. Initially it tasted good, but the taste of Rosemary became too much. Duck fat fries weren't anything special, they actually tastes a bit overcooked. Seating is like picnic benches lived across the room. Interesting experience though!"}
{"text":"UPDATE:   Reading the menu, apparently the wvrst sauce is mayonnaise based, which was not on my dirty fries. I feel like the kitchen made a mistake and added tomato jam to my dirty fries. Mistakes happen, but its really turned me off this place.   Original:   Awesome concept. This is where it gets points. I had a chorizo which was decent. If you're gonna do a place that sells just sausages, that sausage better be amazing. This was just okay. I also had the dirty fries, these sounded amazing on the menu however when presented they were a bit underwhelming and had a curry sauce on it. Curry is really polarizing and I for one am not a fan. It may be specified somewhere on the menu but they should really put that wvrst sauce = curry!  Overall I'd give this place another shot but I'd stay away from the curry fries and try something other than the chorizo."}
{"text":"Great beer and wide range of sausages. I love the modern beer hall look they have going on. The food is mediocre but just a good place for casual place to hang out. The best part was the service here was top notch from the servers to the bouncer himself."}
{"text":"We had heard good things about this place and decided to check it out for a small going away dinner. We were greeted by friendly and knowledgeable staff who gave us the run down of how the place worked and all the options. The restaurant was really clean and everything looked well taken care of.  Between the 5 of us we sampled a good number of the sausages (I had the Calabrese) and none of us had any complaints. Though I would agree with some of the other reviews that the portion sizes were slightly disappointing. From the fridge at the front it looked as though the sausages would have been a bit larger.  The beer selection was pretty good, but also expensive with the average price being around $15.   Overall we had a really nice night. We were there for over 2 hours and never felt pressured to leave. The only complaint we really had was the music kept getting louder and louder throughout the night making it difficult to hear the person right across the table.  Can't wait to go back and try something else!"}
{"text":"Very good Sausages... I would say the street vendor sausages are a few steps behind but I say in the ballpark. This isn't a knock, the sausages from there vendors are extremely good already."}
{"text":"Now....I love sausage, I love a little adventure and don't need fancy tablecloths.....but I really love sausages the most.  I'm a senior, probably the oldest in the room, but I thoroughly enjoyed it!!!   So the music was a little loud, (my wife thought) but it's a fun place, lots of great beers and ciders, many you don't see in other places.  We went there for my birthday and even the marshmallow ice cream was great.....I'll be back even if it isn't my birthday!!!   They are among the great bbq places we now have in Toronto!!   Tables are easier to get during the week and there's parking in the building next door......try it, you'll love it....I may see you there!!!"}
{"text":"Their duck fat french fries were great. However, they're obviously Belgian fries and not french fries.  The service was decent - It probably took a little over 10 minutes for me to get my sausage, but I saw some people who had ordered after me get their food first.  Wvrst reminded me of a place in Downtown Los Angeles. I'm not sure which establishment was up first, but the concept was exactly the same. In any case, regardless of which came first, both were good."}
{"text":"WVRST is the type of place I would visit frequently if I were a local. The place is set up like a German Beer Hall with community tables and has an impressive selection of craft beers including numerous local options on tap and aged bottles. The restaurant also serves a large variety of sausages from unusual options like Elk and Kangaroo to more traditional options like Pork and Beef. I tried the Elk Sausage and Duck Fat Fries. The Elk Sausage was filling and full of flavor! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. My only criticism is the sausage was a little burnt. The duck fat fries were addictive and a must order if you visit. The side of Maple/Rosemary dipping sauce was very flavorful and the perfect compliment to the fries. Being a tourist, I had to sample a number of the local beers and WVRST offered the perfect opportunity to do so. All the beers I sampled were delicious! Overall, WVRST is a must visit for craft beer or sausage lovers."}
{"text":"I generally don't like sausages, with the exception of gourmet ones.WVRST is a newly opened gourmet sausage and beer eatery on King West, a fairly new concept in the city. Although I'm not crazy about beer, I was quite excited to try it out.  The menu was very simple, and the sausage are served two ways: currywvrst style and on a bun. Of course I had to try both! For the bun, I opted for turkey/chicken sausage with sautéed jalapeños and caramelized onion. I modified my concoction into a hot dog by adding ketchup and grainy mustard. However, I wasn't overly impressed by the sausage. It had decent flavours, but the texture was too dry. The toppings were very tasty though, but I wanted more on my bun.    For the currywvrst, we chose spicy Italian with pork and chili flakes. For me, I preferred the sausage on a bun, and again I found the sausage here overly dry. It was served with two pieces of rye bread, which I didn't enjoy nearly as much as the bun. The overall texture was tough and chewy.   In addition to the two sausage dishes, we also got a small order of plain fry Belgian-style fries with maple rosemary dip. The fries were actually my favouite part of the meal and the maple rosemary dip was quite addictive. That said, I think it is pretty hard to mess up fries too badly.   Overall, I think WVRST didn't live up to the hype. I was intrigued by the sausage/beer hall concept, but I wasn't overly impressed by the gourmet sausages. Both of my selections were overly dry and didn't wow me with flavours. Perhaps I should have ventured out to try one of the game sausages, but nevertheless, it wasn't remarkable enough for me to come back."}
{"text":"A fantastic spot with a lot of friends - just make reservations. It is exceptionally busy Friday and Saturday nights.  Its as close to a German beer hall as we have in Toronto with long tables and great craft beer.  Get a flight to try some of the broad selection they have on offer.  The sausages are also really fantastic - my favourite is the Chorizo but they have a broad selection including a decent vegetarian option.  Like a beer hall, no one comes to serve your table.  You have to go order and then they will bring the food to you."}
{"text":"A great place to start your evening or even a place to have a late meal and hang out with friends.  The size of the beers are unreal and the food is great. The ordering structure is something to get used you and the tables are usually crowded.   Make sure you give yourself lots of time, but its well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure Wvrst has the best fries in Toronto. They're crispy and have this rich, almost buttery taste. The dipping sauces are fantastic too, my favourites are maple rosemary and black pepper onion. Their beer selection is amazing.  Unfortunately their sausages are ok but don't hold up the the fries and beer. I've tried all three of their veggies sausages and they were pretty dry. My girlfriend had a few of the meat sausages and she wasn't all that blown away either.  There are no tables here, just very long benches that span the entire room. This isn't the best place for quiet conversion for that reason but it's probably really great for groups. Depending on when you come expect long lines and difficulty finding a seat.  All in all I love this place and come fairly often! The fries are really worth a special trip."}
{"text":"Overall impression: A casual and modern hipster joint with delicious sausages and a large selection of craft beer.   This cafeteria style restaurant is impressive. Althoguh it's cafeteria style, the staff does an excellent job making you feel comfortable. I'm not sure if there are many places in Toronto that serves exotic meats and duck fat fries, but Wvrst does! The food here is delicious and caters towards meat eaters  and a selection for vegans and vegetarians as well. They also have a huge selection of craft beer for all those crafty beer enthusiasts.   The pricing is also affordable for quality crafted food! I definitely have become a fan of Wvrst and will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere! Food is unreal! Duck fat fries are out of this world. A must try!!!"}
{"text":"So far I've tried kangaroo, rabbit, bison, and most recently elk sausage hotdog. So far my favorite has been elk because it was very flavorful, lean, and tender. Second would be either bison or kangaroo. A MUST have is their duck fat fries! They also have an lot of beers to choose from but since I don't drink, I just get the root bear.   Service is quite fast even on a busy Friday night. If you're into the bar scene and ambiance, it's a great place to eat. But if you can't stand the loud music, then just eat quickly and leave.   Overall, nice experience but somewhat pricey."}
{"text":"A cornucopia of dudes with moustaches (Happy Movember, friends!), sausages and giant beer steins made this place super loveable, with a dash of annoying, this time around.   Guess what? I like kangaroo meat. Who knew! If it's a fancy meat, they have in sausage form. Their duck fat fries are also good. Everything in duck fat. All of the time.   PEPPER'S PISSED: About how they handle reservations. If someone is over 30 minutes late they have to wait outside? Be treated like a walk-in? Even if most of the party is inside already? This is a big city with busy people and we're spending money drinking and eating there all night. If it's about turnover, guess what? We're not leaving until the whole party sits and eats together... so.... you're actually making the whole thing slower. YA HEAR?!  Wowza! I was really pissed there. But again, mmmm sausage.  21/30"}
{"text":"Great Casual Atmosphere, good Beer Selection, and most importantly the food is out of this world.  Can't go wrong with just about any sausage and Duck fat Fries are a must!"}
{"text":"Location: King Street West, Toronto,  Items Ordered: Guinea Fowl, Cheddar/Asparagus ($9), Bison, Blueberry/Maple ($9), Dirty Duck Fat Fries, Large ($7.5)  I'm a big fan of this joint! Excellent variety of international sausages paired with a delicious selection of craft and international beers. You can tell the owner really put a lot of thought into marrying the right beers to the right meats.     I had the Guinea Fowl (Cheddar/Asparagus) with sauteed jalapenos and onions. Perfect! My friend had the Bison (Blueberry/Maple) which was equally as good. The duck fat fries were a great add on. And in our case, La Trappe beers were the right beverage to wash it down with.     Quality beers and fresh, juicy sausages, who could be sad.     Plus, the atmosphere matches the food well. A large industrial looking warehouse, long, communal, wooden tables and benches ohh, and a display case showcasing the meats in its raw state is a great touch. Well not for the weak-hearted.    I usually bring out of town meat-eaters here who always leave beyond satisfied."}
{"text":"I was VERY skeptical about this place until a friend suggested it who had often been for lunch. It's not healthy, so if you're trying to eat well, stay away. Definitely worth a visit though I would not come often (a bit expensive for a sausage and so fatty). The sausages with toppings were yummy, as were the duck fat fries (told you it was bad for you) and they have an unadvertised great selection of beer! The bartender was awesome and very knowledgeable about all the draft he had. All in all a fun night."}
{"text":"I met some friends here last weekend, there was a line up outside taking 15 minutes to get in. Pros: ambiance, variety of sausages and beers. Cons: over priced, slow service, confusing drink menu."}
{"text":"i've been to this one of a kind resturant multiple times, i've personally only ever had the \"game meats\" which had been extremely tasty and flavorful. the duck fat fries are to die for. they have over 30 different beers on tap...including a cider and a \"homebrewed\" beer as well. i absolutely love this place and i am glad it exsists. it can get kind of pricy fairly quick, but the quality in the food is worth the price BAR NONE  the only compliant i have against this place is do not go their on a hockey night...you will be waiting outside, reguardless of a reservation or not. excellent atmosphere, excellent dining arrangements  just don't dance on the tables!  LOL!"}
{"text":"Another Hipster Haven totally worthy of 5 stars!  My BF & I love trying new things, and their kangaroo and wild boar sausages did not disappoint! Even the vegan sausages were very good.  And the fries! OMG THE FRIES - with duck fat or without, equally amazing. And the very very best part of Wvurst - the sauces! OMG THE SAUCES! I am a self-declared condiment fiend and easily would have ordered one of each had my more reasonable BF not reminded me that they charge for extra sauce.  Boo. Either way, my faves to date are the maple/rosemary (to die!!), wvurst, buttermilk ranch, bacon mayo, and jalepeno/cilantro yogurt sauce. I know that's like half the menu, but sorry, not sorry.  I've been here twice, and depending on who your with (and their ability to share), I would highly recommend getting one sausage currywurst style, one on a bun and an order of fries to share - it's a good amount of food for two people without being overboard. And splurge on an extra sauce because you're going to have a terrible time choosing only one!   I love the beer hall, free-for-all seating - it makes it all a little more adventurous since you're in close proximity to your neighbors, but you might have difficulty finding a table, as it gets quite busy. Lastly, the bar staff is very knowledgeable (like, certified, knowledgeable) about their beer selection, which is nice when you're having difficulty deciding what goes best with some of their more bizarre sausage combos!"}
{"text":"Having spent 4 days in Munich in 2010 I was desperately wishing for a German Bierhall in Toronto. When Wvrst opened in 2011 I was ecstatic. I've been there about 5 times since June 2011. Having recently become a vegetarian I was very happy to find 2 kinds of veggie sausages on the menu which I ordered a double portion currywurst (curried ketchup) style with pomme frites, amazing. I also ordered a mass (litre stein) of Pabst Blue Ribbon for $10. At the time the only beer you could get in litres was Pabst, since then they've made some of the Premium German and Craft beers they have also available in the steins. Something manly about doing a bicep curl every time you have a swig of beer. The ambience itself is kind of old school German Bierhall large open room with big long communal tables, but with a modern twist, not as rustic, still awesome. There is usually good music playing, it varies but I've heard Classic Rock, Alternative, hip hop. A great place to drink beer with friends as it can accomodate really large groups.The staff were super friendly, hip but not a bunch of doofuses. I like the communal element as in Germany if the place is busy you must split a table with your neighbors which I could see being the basis for a lot of fun interactions."}
{"text":"Talking to people who know their beers is becoming harder to find.  Not at Wvrst!   Every question I had was answered, and suggestions were always spot on from the staff working there.   Their beer menu is extensive, and includes a reserve store of some unique albeit pricey beers.   They also have a great tap selection of local, German, Quebec beers.     This place is a typical German sausage joint - self-service.   They will bring you the food when it is ready though.  We went with some local Torontonian friends, so they showed us the ropes.  I had the Dutch Kaas sausage (pork filled with cheese) and it was incredible.  We also shared the fries with EVERYTHING on them - jalapenos, peppers, caramelized onions, duck fat, and wvrst sauce - these were sooo tasty.  Great visit, will return."}
{"text":"WVRST is still my favourite bar (maybe \"one of\" my favourites. Easily top 3), it's been 2.5 years since my last review. And Kathy H here has since visited quite a lot of bars in Toronto! (and other cities! not Markham, my home, as they don't have any bars... not really)  Firstly - kangaroo, bison, boar, pheasant, elk sausages - chorizo, ocktoberfest, italian sausages - the cheapest is the $6 all beef/bacon sausage called \"Danger Dog\" There's more on the menu. just as an FYI I've had all of these above ;) so you're right, I have been returning here. A lot.  I've had them served on a bun, like a hot-dog, I usually go with onions and/or peppers (two free toppings) and I've had the sausages cut up into bite-sized pieces and drenched in tomato curry sauce (currywvrst)  I can die here.  Fries are delicious with the duck-fat. Sometimes they put too little, sometimes soaked. Dirty Duck version is peppers, jalapeños and onions with lots of WVRST specialty sauce. This is tasty, and I'd order if you think fries are a little boring. It's sort of like a deluxe WVRST-style poutine (without cheese, without gravy).  \"Small\" is actually a generous portion of fries. One person eats a Small (without sausage) and can get full.  Dipping sauces are made in-house, comes free with your order. Or +$1 to add another. Chipotle has always been my favourite. The fries plus currywvrst are also surprisingly delicious. Sweet Chili is nice too. Never really liked the Wasabi Miso.  Beer selection is fantastic!! I love the German wheat beer, second last on the LEFT menu. Whatever that is. I can never pronounce it right.  Do I live next to here now? oh yes. seriously. I even brought my macbook and studied here (alone) because they have free wifi."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Great selection of interesting meats and even better selection of beers!  The duck fat fries are amazing and my favourite sausage is the wild boar, although the danger dog is great as a curry wurst too.  I have been here many times and always had a great experience and found it easy to find a seat.  I noticed a few people complaining about the noise pollution but in my opinion that adds to the authentic beer hall experience that you would find in Munich!"}
{"text":"My husband ate a kangaroo sausage. Kangaroo! Freaked me the f&ck out but I certainly respect his adventurous appetite. Anyhow, the bartenders were awesome, the selection was crazy-pants, and the scene was unpretentious but definitely hip. Will definitely be back next time we're in town...I understand he has some elk to experience."}
