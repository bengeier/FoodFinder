{"text":"I saw this food truck at Ryerson with a line up and was curious to try it. I was greatly disappointed with the quality of the food. The beef brisket sandwich was very dry and tasteless. I did not even taste any horseradish mayo on the sandwich and there was so little horseradish mayo that it wasn't even noticeable either. 

For the price for the sandwich it's better to get something else because it was not filling and it took long to make it for something poorly done."}
{"text":"I saw the signs on my way in to work today that the food truck was in Liberty Village and the anticipation was building all morning.

I love a good brisket sandwhich, but alas this was in the bottom couple that I've ever had. Bread was burnt and weird textured, meat was tough and lacked smokey flavour, and the horseradish mayo was underwhelming. The portion size was also pretty small for $11, as you can go into many brick and mortars and get a much larger sandwich for about the same.

I appreciate the art of smoking, and the challenges of doing this in a food truck environment, and I did enjoy the 100 sauces they had to spice it up, but unfortunately only 2 stars from me.

I just finished it about 10 minutes ago and I'm hungry."}
{"text":"This truck was parked outside City Hall last week and usually I see long line ups for this truck, so I figured I should try it (thankfully the cooler weather meant a shorter line). 

The girl behind me enthusiastically recommended the Po Boy sandwich and it was delicious and simple. The meat was juicy and delightfully greasy, which definitely made the meat taste really rich. Admittedly, I didn't taste too much of the horseradish mayo, but it was all delicious nonetheless. Thank goodness I'm not a vegetarian!"}
{"text":"This is the \"cool kid\" of food trucks. I don't 100% know if that's good or not, but I think it is. Loud music and lots of laughter and smiles from the staff (in the midst of long lines and heat) were nice, but maybe they could cut down on the jokes just a tad and reduce the wait for food post-order from 20 minutes to 10? This is fast food without the \"fast.\" And for 13 dollars, this sh*t better be good, and those odd ingredients (Root beer smoked beans? Mango jalapeno patron sauce?) better not be a gimmick to mask mediocre food...

They weren't. This place is pretty solid!  The brisket was smoky and a bit sweet, juicy and not too fatty. It was served on a foccacia-type bun - non-traditional as someone may have remarked early, but I don't feel like I needed something heavier on this hot day. The sauce I chose was delicious. The slaw was colourful though a little sweet, and the beans...I'd give them a \"good\" as well, plus a point for uniqueness. That little cornbread circle was yummmmmy. I got my sandwich without cheese, but I don't think I missed much by avoiding those Kraft shavings (and I noticed that they are also using Dempster's bread for Grilled Cheese?)

Pricey, but not bad value for what you get - certainly a nice-sized portion.

Best ever? Probably not. Good? yes.

3.5 stars...rounding up to 4 because they are the cool kid."}
{"text":"I tried the pulled pork bun.  There are lots of pork in it, much more than my expectation.  It comes with no sauce.  In front of the truck there are so many to choose from.  May be a good way to spend time to go through the sauces while waiting.  Some of the pulled pork are dried.  Basically it is still yummy.  Next time I have to put much more sauce on the pork."}
{"text":"This is fast become one of my favourite restaurants. If you're a meat lover and enjoy barbecue, then this is the place for you. The food is absolutely delicious, the price is reasonable and the staff, very friendly. A must visit - you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Soooooo overpriced. Takes forever for food to come out (the restaurant even acknowledges this on its website). Brisket super dry. Sides are also mah. Seating super uncomfortable. Only upside, very friendly staff. Would not go back or try other locations."}
{"text":"Overall great experience. We showed up late as the kitchen was about to close, but they were very accommodating and the service was excellent. The beef ribs were gigantic - delicious seasoning and cooked to perfection. Would highly recommend the mac and cheese on the side. Good beer selection, reasonable price and the staff really made the experience for us!"}
{"text":"Only had the back ribs... best we ever had, super meaty, tender, sauces were great esp. black and blue one. Service was super attentive and prompt. Prices are good considering the quality. Cocktails not in my budget but the list looked nice. Casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is one of the better tasting food trucks around town.  Their pulled pork meat is is tender, moist and seasoned well.  The signature pulled pork sandwich is huge!  The Brisket Po Boy is also very tasty, with the same pulled pork topped with cheese and sauce that gives it another unique tastes from the signature pork sandwich.  On top of the tasty meals, this food truck accepts credit cards!!"}
{"text":"The service here is excellent as we patiently received a lot of help and explanation as new and first-time customers.  The food was a bit a mixed bag.  We got an assorted platter and there were some high and low points.  The beef brisket was definitely a high point as it was amazingly tender and tasty.  It was probably the finest beef brisket I'd ever tasted. 
 The beef rib though was way too fatty and a little on the tough side.  The loin back ribs were better but too sweet for my personal taste.  

As for the sides, the ember grilled vegetables were amazing as was the purple slaw (the vinegary taste helps cut through the richness of the meat).  Both the cajun chips and duck fat fries were fine but there was way too much of both of them and the cajun chips were a little overcooked.  

We also received a variety of sauces.  I took a strong dislike to the bbq sauce while the blueberry sauce and habanero sauce were pretty forgettable.  However, the honey dijon sauce was absolutely incredible!  I think we ended up using half of the bottle that we had available to us.

Overall, the good points outweigh the not so good ones.  At least next time, I'll know what I'll order.  And watching some of the other customers around us, it's clear that they have a lot of interesting stuff on their menu besides their smoked meats so I hope to be back and work my way down the menu."}
{"text":"This was one of the more disappointing food truck experiences I've had. I ordered the Brisket Po Boy for $11 I think, and I don't think I quite got my money's worth in terms of food quality. The brisket was tough, and I didn't really enjoy the rub that was used to marinate the meat and lacked the smoky flavour of a bbq. This is kind of surprising cause I thought brisket was supposed to be one of their signature items. Overall, although the portion was quite satisfying and was enough to make me full, I can order from other food trucks and leave feeling satisfied by both quality AND quantity for less than $10. Sadly, I came to the realization that not all food from a food truck would be like those seen on the Food Network. Sigh."}
{"text":"My experience here is always worthwhile. I'm a big fan of the variety of meat they smoke and you can't go wrong with any of them. I've never tried the back ribs because the side ribs are so meaty I've never felt the need to try anything else. All of thier sides are very delicious. If you have 4 or more people the kitchen sink fries are a great start to share with the entire table. The down stairs areas has a cool vibe to it. They have a wide variety of sauces, I would have liked to try out the Alabama White but they didn't have any prepared at the time. The menu is quite different than the other location you have to pay for all of the sides instead of it coming with your selection of meats.

As with the Queen east location you can collect loyalty points toward free appetizers and discounts off your total bill. 

The is the best BBQ in the city and they are consistent as the other great location. 

I would love to see VIP events for people that have a certain amount of points and perhaps a wider dessert menu.

I am truly a loyal fan and I always try to convince family and friends to have dinner here."}
{"text":"Great service, our server Sarah was amazing. I couldn't ask for a better server, she was energetic and made sure we enjoyed everything we tasted. She explained all the hints of flavour in the different sauces. You get to try them all. Hogfather is my fave. We are going back for the Walter White. Great local find."}
{"text":"Booked a table via opentable asked for a quiet table in the corner. On arriving, woman who sat us clearly didn't care put us in the most ridiculous seat in the middle of the restaurant in front of the meat smoker room and the bar, we asked to move although the one we moved to wasn't much better. 
Where we ended up sitting was actually right next to the bar where all the servers were walking up and down the floor. We were at our table for about 10 mins and was quite clear we were ready to order and could see all the staff were either standing around talking, eating or looking right through us. It must have been 10+ different staff that walked right past us a ton of times, despite us looking directly at them we were clearly being ignored so got up and left. Despite others who arrived after being attended straight away. I'm not a mug and they would expect to pay them a minimum 15% tip for that kind of 'service'. Sneakily cancelled our initial reservation to avoid the poor review on other websites as well."}
{"text":"I am not a huge connoisseur of Carolina style pulled pork and have only made it about a half dozen times myself.  However, I was really underwhelmed with the pulled pork sandwich from Hogtown.  Pulled pork (especially Carolina style) should be tender and full of flavor/tangy - it wasn't.  The pork was VERY dry, hard and lacking flavor - even after I added ~2 tbsps of the Hogtown Spicy BBQ Sauce.  C'mon guys - it is harder to make a bad pulled pork sandwich than it is to make a good one.  Which tells me, that the pork I ordered today is likely several days old.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"A mobile smokery... interesting concept (though with the CO2 emissions from the truck and the smoke that's produced from 16+ hrs of smoking, it may not be the greenest thing out there :) ). I'm a huge BBQ fan and love food trucks, so you can imagine my excitement here.

Hogtown smoke recently opened up and made a trip up to Markham (yes, far, far away) for an event over the weekend and I had the chance to try their beef brisket sandwich. 

While the sandwich was good, I'll have to admit I've had better. And for $13 a pop, it's pricey; especially when Caplansky's Truck was serving up a good brisket sandwich of their own for $7 two trucks down. 

The portions were small, but my biggest complaint is actually the bread they used. A square focaccia looking holey-bread, it was bland with a weird texture. It didn't contribute anything to the sandwich; if anything it took away from the meat itself.  I would have much preferred a different type of bread, even a regular old burger bun would have been better.  Or maybe try toasting up that cardboard.

The horseradish sauce and BBQ sauces were good, and after discarding the bread I enjoyed the meat itself which was moist (though small portioned for $13). 

The small sides of beans were pretty good, but the coleslaw was average.

Other sites seem to indicate that they're typically at Queen and Jarvis, though I'd think torontofoodtrucks.ca/ will have them listed soon and they're on twitter: https://twitter.com/#!/hogtownsmoke for more updates

The food truck craze is in full flight all around North America, and I love the fact that it's coming to Toronto as well, but just 'cause food trucks are a novelty here in TO doesn't mean you get an automatic thumbs up - you need some good grub and reasonable prices (how a sandwich at a food truck can cost more than a gourmet sandwich at a brick and mortar is beyond me), and sadly, Hogtown Smoke doesn't provide either."}
{"text":"Manager turned away a seated table of 6 without even taking the courtesy to talk to us despite the fact we were there 30 minutes before the kitchen was supposed to close. Keep in mind we had already sat down for 5-10 minutes and were given menus and ready to order. They had a see through glass window to the kitchen and the cooks gave us angry stares as we sat there like we had offended them by wanting to eat at their restaurant?

Guys listen if you don't want new customers change your hours or just say your closed. The funny thing is if he had just came up and talked to us like a human being we would have been totally understanding but instead he told the waitress to kick us out like 10 feet of the table completely within earshot. The whole experience was so dramatically rude it bordered on comedic. 

Our waitress was super nice though despite her incompetent manager. Kudos to her!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service,  super chill atmosphere.  I will be back every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The beef brisket and pulled pork are really good, they were soft.  Also the chicken wings were really well done, crispy skin.  The potato chips are spicy too."}
{"text":"After walking up and down the row of food trucks at the CNE, S and I came to a consensus to try the ever so tempting grilled cheese sandwich with pulled pork, peppers and carmelized onions. At a price of $9, it was definitely pricey but we thought it would be worth it, given the line up the truck had (all the other ones looked pretty stale), and seeing the sandwiches come out really did smell and look hearty.

The guys on the truck were super friendly, and open to letting us take photos of them with the giant pork they were planning to shred to pieces. They have been on numerous TV shows and were prepping for their next big gig the next day so I'm sure they did not want to disappoint the visitors there that day either.

After about 10 minutes of waiting, we got our sandwich and parked on a bench, excited to dive into our sandwich..... What looked and smelled out of this world did not deliver on the taste. The cheese was too overpowering and the spread of pulled pork was not consistent, let alone, was a very small portion of pork throughout. With the peppers and carmelized onions, there was too much stuff happening and not enough delivery of pork goodness.

Deeply saddened, we felt a little ripped off, especially with all the bacon'ed and large food items in the CNE food building selling at a lesser cost, and a bigger portion.

Guess the big hype of the food trucks is really taking over!"}
{"text":"Ordered the jack'd up grilled cheese sandwich with French fries and my husband ordered the beef brisket. Everything came out pretty quick, but in all fairness there weren't too many people there at the time we went in. The grilled cheese was really good, the challah bread was perfectly crispy, there was a lot of pulled pork added, I couldn't taste the 3 cheeses but I could see the ooey gooey cheese. The hogtown mother bbq sauce (mild) was very tasty with my grilled cheese. The brisket was good, but wasn't the best that I have had unfortunately. My husband did enjoy the hogtown Father bbq sauce, he said it added an extra kick (it was the spicier bbq sauce compared to the mother). The cajun chips that came with the brisket were good, I didn't really taste the Cajun spice and the French fries were just okay, a little dry to be honest. I would like to go back and try their regular menu and order some fried chicken for next time."}
{"text":"Ummm I don't know, I felt bad giving them 3 stars since it's more like 3.5 so let us round up!.... I got two pounds of poutine, with pulled pork and 4 cheeses and gravy. They weren't salty surprisingly, I find gravy is usually too salty even for me. The fries were aaaamazing - crispy and delicious and perfectly copperish/golden. The cheese was ok, nothing special. I wasn't that impressed with the pork - but i'm not a huge pork fan unless my dad makes it so maybe i'm biased? Anyway, it was sort of dry for my taste, but overall it make for a pretty delicious poutine!

There was sooo much pork on it, i'm pretty sure 1lb is the fries+cheese and the other is pork.... half and half."}
{"text":"Pulled pork was very good, probably the best we've had. Excellent selection of sauces which were made in-house. You can watch the smoker in action through the glass door. Good atmosphere. Fair price. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I am in town for a conference and was craving some good barbecue and saw Hogtown Smoke on Yelp so I walked over from the convention center. 

Walking in I was instantly comfortable in this historic building married with the vintage industrial decor of the restaurant. Within seconds of walking through the door I was greeted by our server who took us to our seats and took our drink order. 

Scanning the room you will notice the large windows allowing you to see the huge smoker and wood fired grill.  I really enjoy a restaurant that is proud enough of their product that they celebrate its preparation in this way. 

In my head I'm thinking if the food delivers as well as the environment this place is going to be a home run.  The first thing we ordered were some wings and soon our server returned with a small tray of wings. I don't know how else to say it other than these are probably the best wings I have ever had.  They were piping hot, flawlessly seasoned, crispy skin and moist on the inside. If your looking for some drown in sauce, boring old wings you won't find them here!  The seasoning and smokey flavor was spot on. No sauce, no batter just meat done right. 

With the wings being a great start I ordered brisket, pulled pork and sausage.  When it arrived I knew we were in a place that knows their craft.  The brisket was melt in your mouth delicious, the fat rendered to perfection, most and flavorful. The pulled pork, smoky and moist!  

As for the sausage, absolutely flawless. The seasoning, texture and taste simply sublime. This my friends is a superior product prepared to perfection!

Oh and while we were enjoying our mains, we ordered another pound of wings! 

One other thing to mention, they have a wonderful selection of sauces on the table that will satisfy whatever style you may be craving but I would suggest you use them sparingly or not at all. When you have proteins so well prepared they easily stand alone. 

It's going to be hard to head back to California when this conference is over but hopefully I'll have a chance to visit again before I leave."}
{"text":"Night two, round three of the TIFF food trucks.

I wrapped up my shenanigans in front of Bloor Cinema with the Brisket Po Boy. I can't say I've tried enough Po Boy sandwiches to really compare but being what they are this one was pretty straightforward. It was simple yet effective. The rich smoked flavour in the meat shone through the bun like the sun breaking through the clouds after a rain storm. Also, there was cheese, and a nice amount of it, and it was good.

Great job."}
{"text":"Maybe picking what could prove to be the hottest day of the year wasn't the best choice lunch breaks to trek across the city's cement core in search of pork satisfaction.  But whatever, I wanted smoked meat and I was determined to get it.  Once we got down to Front and Bay, today's locale for foodtruckery, Hogtown Smoke was competing with Per Se for my business.  Hogtown had a large group lingering either waiting in line to order or to pick up their grub.  I went with the numbers because I had in fact gone down there for Hogtown and despite my mounting hunger, I was willing to wait.  

I got the Sliders three ways: pulled pork, brisket and patron infused chicken (with slaw, beans and cornbread).  I'm not entirely sure how long it took to get my order but standing out on the pavement with the roar of the generators, heavy construction across the street, with the sun beating down on my sweaty back, it seemed like a really long time... somewhere in the vicinity of 15-20 minutes which seemed unreasonable.  

Once I dug in (in the cool embrace of air conditioning) I was pleased though.  The chicken was really flavourful, especially with the mango patron bbq sauce, the pork was good but seemed a little dry, I don't think I put enough sauce on it.  The brisket, with the slaw on the sandwich was solid.  However, none of the three blew me away.  Were my expectations too high? I would have preferred something more \"bready\" in the bun department, the francese roll seemed like a mismatch in texture.  The purple coleslaw was tangy and crunchy but wasn't a huge stand out but when is it ever?  The little muffin of cornbread was nice, I took to dunking bits of it in bbq sauce.  The beans were awesome!  I'd go back with a soup bowl in hand to partake in those again.  

There was definitely no Barque, or Phil's BBQ quality going on here, but I think they may still be trying to figure out their formula.  Mobile food has unique challenges, I'm sure, and since the trend is still developing here, I'll be patient, and be a supportive customer when these folks truck into my parts of town.  I might be more inclined to go with the shorter line though, as I've been learning that a long line doesn't necessarily mean a quality experience.  Sheep no more!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, the decor and the atmosphere was great but the food was a disappointment. Ordered the St Louis Ribs, brisket and turkey. The ribs and brisket were very dry, and the sauces provided didn't help. The brisket was probably the worst I have ever had, the pieces I was given were just devoid of fat and actually tough to chew. The only redeeming things on my platter were the chips and the smoked turkey. I am unlikely to return."}
{"text":"Great brisket. Burnt ends were nice and re-caramelized in a blueberry sauce. Ribs were tasty but could have been more tender. 

Rustic atmosphere on the pack patio that was really Texas. Cocktails and service were so-so."}
{"text":"I give this place the same review Randy Carlyle gave goaltender James Reimer a few years back. 

I thought it was OK, you know? Just OK. 

Best thing was the cornbread muffins with bourbon butter side dish. Everything else was just ok.  Well ok, overpriced too.  Very nice atmosphere though. Sadly, could not take the ambiance of the dining room home with me and crap it out the next day. 

Better off paying $50 bucks a person at Copacabana."}
{"text":"Hogtown Smoke is a food truck servicing the GTA that does various BBQ sandwiches (pulled pork, brisket, chicken). The plus of this truck, is that when you order a meal it comes with a little piece of corn bread, baked beans and coleslaw. With all of these extra add ons you will definitely walk away feeling full. (and this is a problem I have had with some food trucks).

The cons is when it comes to taste, and overall enjoyment. While I liked the cornbread, I did not quite like the BBQ. When I was there I got the slider sampler, so I got sliders for all three kinds of their BBQ sandwiches. The problem with all three sliders was that they were too dry. They have some homemade sauces that you can add on to your sandwich, but you would need to add a lot of the sauce for it to really compensate for the dryness."}
{"text":"Solid truck, definitely one of the better in the city, slightly inconsistent with the BBQ options, sometimes are better then other times, take your chances, but I would recommend you give it a try, when its good... its damn good."}
{"text":"We went for dinner on Friday evening ... we ordered a half rack of baby back ribs, a half pound of beef brisket and a quarter pound of pulled pork for a taste. Served with chips/fries and we also ordered a side of mac & cheese to try.

The ribs were very good, the brisket excellent, the pork OK. They don't sauce the meat - they bring you a caddy with 5 sauce options + ketchup. Loved the black & blue, the carolina yellow was delish, the hog mother and hog father were good. Chips & fries are quite good. Mac & cheese was tasty but a bit on the dry side for our taste.

The place is busy. We sat in the room on the \"side\" and it was annoying when they turned on the sound for the Raptors game - don't mind watching it but didn't want to listen to the game & accompanying commercials."}
{"text":"Cool spot with a Southern smokehouse/saloon vibe. Nice addition to the Old Toronto neighborhood of St Lawrence where establishments can get a little stuffy and overdone, this casual but cool atmosphere is a welcome change. Some interesting bourbons, local brews and lots of barbecue make it shine.

The barbeque is spot on too. Went straight to the smoker for meat by the lb, and it was quite a meal. The pulled pork is tender and juicy - but make sure you hit it with a squirt of that mustard-based BBQ sauce. The back ribs weremeaty and moist, and the brisket is melt in your mouth. I seriously doubt there's anything that comes out of those smokers that wouldn't blow you away. I can't wait to come back for the pig head tacos and smoked short ribs."}
{"text":"My husband is crazy for BBQ brisket and pulled pork, so when I found out about this truck being close to his office, I decided to surprise him with some of the items from this truck for lunch.

1. Beef Brisket Sandwich, which is supposed to be their speciality, was dry, tough and very thickly cut.  The flavour was only just ok.  The dark bun - intolerable.

2. Pulled pork sandwich, again flavour was just ok, and a better bun, but still not great..

3. 1/3 rack of rib special.  Weird mix of spices that overpowered the ribs and smoke flavour.  Didn't finish these.  Beans that came with it had an odd taste, was it the root beer?  


At $10 each, the prices were fair, but not for the quality of food, and the line ups are crazy.  

For now we will stick with Lou Dawgs, which is quite good, especially the juicy beef brisket, as well as convenient being close by and fast.

I admit, watching Food Truck shows on the Food Network had us eager to try some food truck eats, but this experience was a definite miss."}
{"text":"Great place for a drink and some 'cue. Went when they had some live music in the basement, it was that perfect level of \"loud enough to bop your head to but not loud enough so you have to scream at your friend.\" Get the burnt ends and wash it down with Wild Turkey (or something top shelf if you want, I'm not your mom) and live life to the fullest."}
{"text":"I finished a Two Pounds of Poutine ($8) - 3 Cheese & Curds, Pulled Pork and Gravy all by myself.

It was that good... Everything the way I like it, especially with the gravy not being over salty.. but it might not be a good thing for some other people?

Really 2 lbs?I ate the whole thing  all by myself... at least no one was watching!"}
{"text":"The smells from their BBQ meats brought me to their truck. I couldn't help but buy one of their pulled porks sandwiches. Meat was amazing. Loved their mild sauce that they offered. Def pulled everything together. As far as price, I would have to say that the burger is a little expensive considering they are serving me food on a truck. No rent, silverware, or a lot of service (other than taking my order and handing it to me through their side window). It was great to try it out but i dont plan on making the extra effort to find them."}
{"text":"This food truck is a hit with me. Here is why.

We had a work function where Hogtown catered. As someone who has visited BBQ in Texas, I can safely say this has become my number 2 spot for best bbq in Toronto. FYI there isn't a number 3. 

I didn't see the prices, but when you have some pretty good bbq, cost really doesn't matter (re: smoking meats for endless hours, knowledge of good wood to use, offset smoker etc.) I ordered the brisket, but here is the trick, don't get it in a sandwich, just the meat. The brisket had a delicious crust (no cayenne, A+), however it was a bit dry on the edges. The middle was moist and flavourful if you got some. Nice and light smoke flavour, it could use more, but it's all in the art.

The cornbread was kinda whatever, more like mini corn muffins, purple slaw had little to no flavour and the root beer beans were way too sweet for my taste. I really think they should drop the sandwiches and just get a side of white wonder bread and meat, texas style. A pickle too. 


 4 stars for bbq in toronto, however in the grand scheme of world bbq it would've been a 3/5."}
{"text":"This restaurant is polluting the neighbourhood in which it rests.  The constant spewing of particulate containing smoke into the atmosphere and the noxious smell of burning wood makes it impossible for tenants of the adjacent buildings to open their windows.  Despite many requests, the management refuses to install the filters needed to reduce the immense health hazards that they are causing.  If you care about the environment, this is not a place to patronize."}
{"text":"ok, this restaurant deserves more than 5 stars!! how come it doesn't have 5 stars I wonder!!
The ribs was awesome, the chicken wings was awesome, the brisket was awesome.
the waitress was super kind and helpful. Definitely will go again and 100% recommend it!"}
{"text":"The scent of smoky wood got me even before stepping into the restaurant.  If you love southern BBQ, you will love this mild scent.

We came during weekday lunch so it was quite empty.  I got the \"Jack'd up grilled cheese\" and \"bacon wrapped onion rings\" to share.  

First off, the grilled cheese \"samiche\" hit all the right notes of the palette.  Every bite was full of tender pork, gooey soft cheese and a slight sweet note of Hogmother sauce.  This sandwich is to die for.  

The bacon wrapped onion rings however was a disappointment.  Batter too thick and overly salty.  It was intimidating to even finish one donut sized onion ring.

Overall, pulled pork samiche was very good. I would come back to try their other meats.  Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Tried the fried chicken special on Friday night. Crispy, juicy and very tasty and served in a bucket as a nice touch. Ample, tasty sides and a good price. Looking forward to coming back to try the BBQ dishes."}
