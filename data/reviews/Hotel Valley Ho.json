{"text":"Expected a better \"resort\" experience.
Check-in was poor. Our keys were not coded properly, and we had to return to the fron desk to have them re-keyed. Turns out our card packet, which said \"1211\", should have said \"1213\".
Non-valet parking virtually non-existent.
Bartenders could not make simple drinks: a requested Boodles martini was made with Bombay gin instead; an Irish coffee was made, twice, with Bailey's, not black coffee with Jameson's and whip cream, even after we told our waiter how it should be made.
Zuzu food presentation was poor: Short ribs were tough and dry, plopped on to grits with roasted (as in, burned) vegetables.
Only saving grace was Liz and poolside service, which is all we really wanted. So, not a disaster, just a disappointment."}
{"text":"BED BUGS


Liar liar liar !!!!!!!!
I was checked out of the hotel when I called so how could I refuse entry.

I can still tell you where spider webs are In the room that I guarantee you missed.

What about the food and how bad my service was.  I walked out the first night and complained to zac at the front said well let me send you to a restaurant that you will get treated correctly...

I thought I would give Zuzu a second chance. Mainly because i was hungry and did not want to drive.  So that day i spoke to a hostess and sat on the patio not bar like before where I got no service as staff walked past and hung out chatting with the girls  at the coctail service station about the night before.
The service was decent but here it the review of the food:
The chicken matchsticks were burnt over cooked and dry And looked like the oil had not been changed in weeks.  The beef stroganoff pasta was soft meaning over cooked and the sauce was watery and flavorless and technically the beef was the wrong type for a stroganoff. 

I can keep going on about bad things at the hotel but I think enough said!

What a punk you are also as if you have all my info why did you or someone not call me back after I hung up the first time.  Then you see my review and lie and still don't call me back.

Where is any customer service!!!

You have my number on file and I left it on the assistant to the gm voice mail as no one was in the office to answer my call on a Thursday at 4pm.  

What type of operation are you people running or should i say not running.

If you had done your job correctly and called me and tried to correct and explain your side then maybe I would have changed my opinion of the hotel and altered my previous comments to reflect a more positive customer experience.  
Instead you don't call and lie to try and defend my comments and make me stand by my previous statements of I WILL NEVER STAY AT OR RECOMMEND ANY PROPERTY RUN BY YOUR GROUP AND WILL INFORM ALL TRAVELERS OF MY EXPERIENCE THERE!"}
{"text":"A small group of us stayed at the Valley Ho for just one night for a friends birthday and I absolutly loved this hotel!! We stayed in one of the tower rooms and I just loved the decor. The room was big, had a small sitting area and the balcony. The bed (we had a King) was very comfy, although I am not a fan of feather pillows. The bathroom was awesome and had the biggest, deepest tub I've ever had in a hotel...2 people fit easily (wink, wink)! Our room was immaculately clean...I don't believe I've ever had a hotel room, especially the bathroom be so clean! 

The only drawback for me was the pool and the reason I didn't give 5 stars. Not that it is the hotel's fault, but if the 20 year old Jersey Shore crowd is your thing, then you will love it. I however am a very fun loving 40 year old, and after about 1.5 hours at that pool I was ready to leave. Drunk 20 somethings making fools of themselves=not good...on the plus side it was some dang good people watching! The pool itself is small (consider when it was built) and with that many people lathered up with sunscreen, well you can imagine what the water looked like. Decent prices for drinks though, if you stick with their specials.

The bar was a fun place to hang out at before we went out that night, we did not try the restaurant, but have heard it is very good. 

I would stay here again for sure for a girls weekend or special occasion!"}
{"text":"Put quite plainly, you will never be a better you outside of the Valley Ho. Between the accomodations, the service and the staff, you will never, ever feel better than you do here. And that goes for dogs, too. Even in 120 degree heat (it is a dry heat), you will never be complete until you've experienced the Valley Ho. So, skip the Scientology and the Primal Scream therapy and be the best you you can be."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Valley Ho again; same deal as last year...post-conference at another Phoenix property that I rightly savaged elsewhere. This visit to the HO had me experience encounters with many more of the property's extraordinary staff including Judy, the concierge's concierge and with the attentive but not obsequious pool staff. Textbook service all around which I understand it attributable in part to the low turnover in staff since the hotel reopened.

Though I am not one, but from judging by the books people were reading poolside,  this is the perfect Bobo hangout (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobos_in_Paradise) . 

For me the elegance of the hotel comes from its simplicity and let's all agree that \" simplicity marks the end of a process of refining, while complexity marks a primitive stage\""}
{"text":"Great property! ... Excellent Service.  Fun pool area.  Good food.  Retro furniture.  You really cannot go wrong here.  We stayed mid-week so there were no crowds or loud guests. I would choose this over the high-end resorts any day."}
{"text":"My time at Hotel Valley Ho's spa has been my favorite spa experience thus far. All of the staff were very welcoming, and created a calm and relaxing environment. They were all very accommodating and was not short of making sure our visit was well worth it. I received a facial treatment that I truly recommend! My esthetician was Liz, and she did a tremendous job at not only performing for my skincare needs, but also taking the time to get to know me and made me feel comfortable. My mom was also pleased with her massage with Wesley, and highly praised him for his great service. I guarantee that anyone that is planning to visit the spa at Hotel Valley Ho will definitely not regret it, and will continuously want to return again!"}
{"text":"Stayed here on our wedding night and we enjoyed ourselves. They even gave us complimentary chocolate dipped strawberries. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"2nd stay at the hotel; less impressed with the 2nd visit so far.  Beyond the front desk, the staff is generally rude.  Waited 15 mins for drinks at the pool as people drunkenly cut in the \"line\".  Then i was told they were closed after being told 3 times they would be right with me.  5 people behind the bar took 15 minutes to handle one guy that wanted 6 shots.  From the moment we arrived at the pool, the staff was less than friendly... I live 5 mins away and this is my staycation... not the place for anyone looking to be treated well.

An amendment to the previous:  You know that feeling of something crawling on you at night... turns out to be nothing... Well, to my surprise there were bugs in the bed.  Three roaches scurrying about in the bathroom when I woke up.  Otherwise the room was clean.  Expect to pay for everything, including parking... it's the same cost to park yourself.  This isn't San Francisco so I don't understand the cost.  I could have Uber'd for less.  Sometimes you'd just like things upfront, not additional costs before you walk in the door.  

In addition, the hotel allowed my payment information to be transmitted and viewed unencrypted.  So, now I get to sit and hope someone doesn't use my personal/payment information.  Hooray... what a staycation!"}
{"text":"What an escape! I have \"staycationed\" here a few times; the reasonable summer rates, always-friendly service and impeccably clean + comfy rooms make for the perfect getaway.

I typically book a treatment at the spa during my stays for maximum relaxation. Although there aren't many amenities, they have great monthly and weekday specials and all of the therapists are gracious and professional. Book a Lomi Lomi massage for a completely blissful experience!

Spend your day poolside for an energetic vibe along with attentive servers who always keep your ice water full or queue up cocktails and bites. The bar/lounge at ZuZu is the perfect place to unwind and socialize before heading out to one (or two...or three!) of the sea of amazing restaurants and bars nearby. And if you've melted into your heavenly bed, order room service to put yourself in total vacation bum mode...you won't wanna leave the Valley Ho!"}
{"text":"The Valley Ho only got a star because the Bell Staff and wait staff were over and beyond. Besides that they should be embarrassed. 

Let me start off by saying, we were there to celebrate a wedding. They spent $20K plus on a wedding that was completely disorganized and they should be ashamed at how many people they pissed off from the lack of caring on certain issues to the hypersensitive on things that shouldn't even matter. 

Suggestion, if you are wanting to have a good time at all in Scottsdale don't count on the Ho. We were gonna have some drinks after the wedding at 10p in our room with some of the guests since we got the Tower Suite with has a full kitchen and lots of sitting room and such. Well before we even got to our room we got a complaint, says the report the next day, I don't know how that can happen when no one is in the room. Hmm, oh maybe it was the bachelor party that was going on down the hallway that was in no connection with us. So when security made it up to the room the \"2nd\" time we had one more chance or the cops we getting called.  So we get everyone but 2 people down stairs, those 2 people were sleeping, so there was no noise, and here comes security again saying we are being loud. That is when we got super pissed. Everyone is downstairs but two people sleeping, how is this loud. Words were exchanged and we all went downstairs. 

My boyfriend then tries to talk to hotel management about the situation and they don't wanna hear it. There is a \"no party\" clause that we were told about?!?  First off, we didn't know about that & secondly when did the Ho become a place you can't part at? 

At the end of the day, save you money and don't give the Ho. Just Uber home and sleep in your own bed...

Jesse... We were at no point during our stay told about the no partying clause until after security came. At check in all there was was the passing off of the keys to the room and that's it. We understand that you are a hotel. But let it be known that a place that offers vodka sodas by the pitcher and is known as the \"party\" hotel by all AZ natives, maybe you should reassess your image.  

Secondly, you should give second thoughts to whom you have in place as your wedding planner. There were multiple complaints. This is not the first wedding disaster I have heard about that has happened at your establishment."}
{"text":"I had happily stayed at the Valley Ho in the past and went back thinking it's a no brainer. Only difference, the season. In the summer time this is a pretty much a frat house. So, if you plan to join the \"dudes\" in asserting your dominance by \"whooooing\" from the balconies, go ahead. If you're on a business or relaxing trip and even remotely plan of having any quiet time at all, avoid. Yes I did complain. Yes I was changed rooms. Zero difference."}
{"text":"As a frequent traveler, I couldn't stand to see the inside of one more mid-level Marriot/Hilton hotel.  Valley Ho is a perfect breakaway.  

Two blocks from quaint downtown Scottsdale, it bridges all of the gaps between business travelers, young folks looking to party, and the family on vacation.  I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for the night to celebrate the anniversary of our first date.  We arrived on a lazy Sunday afternoon (mid July) and pulled up to the lobby desk in the back, I told the valet we were just checking in and he directed us to pull up a few feet, but leave the keys for him.  Check-in was smooth, they offered to take our bags to the room for us (we just had one, so I declined).  They gave us a map of the property and showed us where we were, where to park and of course our room location.  We pulled around to the Trader Vic's lot, there is an entrance to the hotel grounds back there and our room was just a few short steps away.

We had the \"Studio Guest Room\" which was identical to the pictures.  It is very spacious and while some may find having a bathtub in the middle of the room is a bit odd, we thoroughly enjoyed it, and it wasn't in our way at all (BTW: the tub holds two people just fine, and has romantic mood lighting).  The bed was very comfortable, although the extending platform around it caught my shins a few times.  We thought the decor was just perfect: just retro enough without going overboard.

The back patio of our room looked into a grass courtyard between the buildings with a fountain at the back.  Although we didn't use the patio (very hot, humid in July here), we noticed that it had a large curtain that could be pulled around for additional privacy.  Very nice touch.

We went to ZuZu for dinner and had a wonderful meal with great service.  My wife and I split a order of beef stroganoff, which had tasty chunks of sirloin (rather than ground beef) and lots of mushrooms.  We also shared the mac-n-cheese (creamy and delicious) and the onion rings (shoestring with sriracha dipping sauce).  When I mentioned to the server that we were celebrating one of our many anniversaries, she comped us and hooked us up with a to-go bag for our dessert.  (At check-in we received a coupon for complimentary dessert w/dinner, but the sever wouldn't take it, so we'll come back some other time and use it).

There were 10 or so people in and around the pool, but there was no music and the crowd was not loud at all.  As we were checking out our room and opened our back curtains a group of \"bros\" were walking by in swimsuits and carrying coolers, figured they were in a room near us, so I was anticipating some \"hootin and holler'in\" but we didn't hear a peep.  Well, check that... we awoke around 1am because of a very large thunderstorm moving thru the area, but I doubt Valley Ho will give me a room credit for \"acts of God\"! 

We very much enjoyed our stay and will definitely come back again!  The room rate was very good, especially considering it's a boutique hotel in downtown Scottsdale (and without a resort fee).

NOTES: Didn't use the internet, TV or mini-bar, although we made our own martinis and did use the supplied martini glasses from the bar."}
{"text":"Just checked out of the Valley Ho and didn't realize how the environment and decor took me out of Phoenix! The vibe at this place is so chill and laid back! The hotel was built in the late 1950's and was beautifully refurbished. It has a very Mad Men feel but a lot of the furnishings are more current so it rarely felt theme-y. The landscaping is very lush and tropical, lots of birds of paradise, hibiscus and palm trees. 

I'm a local and booked the same day through Hotels Tonight and for just a little over a hundred bucks got a SWEET pool view room! The furnishings are very mid century modern, of course, but opening the curtains to the private patio complete with a chaise lounge with room for two to cuddle up on was just awesome. They have great deep bathtubs and glowing blue mood lighting in the room. The pools weren't too busy into the evening so it was private enough to swim and have some moments with the boyfriend. 

I had a chance to check out their restaurant, Cafe Zuzu, when we had dinner with some friends. I highly recommend the slow roasted pork ribs, they were so tender, served with very smooth and simple buttery grits. The location is great, a little set back from Scottsdale road but very easy to walk to the bars and shops in Old Town, and if even Fashion Square if you're so inclined. I'll definitely be paying a return visit or four!"}
{"text":"What happened to my favorite hotel in the valley? It used to have such an upscale retro look and feel - full of color and energy. I just saw the lobby renovation and it's so dark! It's now all black and navy leather with dark wood and dark carpet and black walls. I felt like I needed a headlamp to read the menu at the bar and restaurant. I remember the 60s and 70s - it was full of color splashed over white. Previous reviews compare this to a Mad Men set, but if you google pictures of the set, you will see offices and houses full of colorful decor - not black and navy leather. Such a let down. Very sad. Stay at the pool or in your room - the lobby, bar and restaurant are morose now."}
{"text":"Perfect stay. Desk staff, restaurant and spa staff are all amazing, really friendly, helpful and accommodating, and seem to genuinely want you to be happy. Delicious food at ZuZu. Pool scene is fun and happy, even in sweltering July heat. Complimentary Red Flower soap, lotion, bath gel, shampoo and conditioner are fantastic. Don't hesitate to book this place."}
{"text":"Great, authentic mid-century hotel. This hotel had wide variety of room service options to indulge like red velvet waffles, as well as seasonal vegetable entrees that were both sublime and affordable. Having a patio with a lounger on a green courtyard was a nice touch. The fitness facilities and spacious and up to date with clean modern equipment. During my stay, I had one security issue. Upon returning to my room after a day at work, the door to my hotel room was open ajar. After I went inside I discovered the sliding back door was also unlocked. The maids did not close and lock the doors after their service. Nothing was missing but when I reported to the hotel, the desk staff showed little concern."}
{"text":"This hotel exceeded all of my expectations! You will be treated by friendly staff, the concierge has hook ups all over the state for anything you can think of, the rooms are very comfortable and well appointed, and the pool is the best in Scottsdale! HVH is a block away from all of Old Town Scottsdale. Kevin and Kheri took care of us by the pool by day and a number of other staff took care of us in the ZuZu lounge by night. They will even set up a private SUV to pick you up or drop you off at the airport for a flat $30 fee! If you're looking for an experience second to none, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"The Valley Ho was the hotel for our October wedding and it couldn't have been a better experience. 

Since all of our guests were from out of town, we wanted to make sure everyone had a fun, relaxing, more-vacation-less-wedding experience and VH delivered. With roughly 100-something guests staying over a three-day weekend, the staff and management were responsive, well organized and understanding. We got married at another location (though if you're planning a wedding, VH has several great locations on property you should think about! Just a little too small for our event) and VH was very helpful in suggesting transportation companies and keeping the bar open for us when we got back. And most importantly, our guests LOVED it and had a great time. A few have already gone back to AZ and stayed at VH.

I've also been a repeat guest over the years and never had a bad time. Rooms are great (very up to date, VH is good about renovating the property before it feels old and tired), ZuZu food is awesome and the indoor/outdoor bar area is perfect. Pool area is busy and very social during the day, but quiet at night so noise isn't an issue. And it's walking distance to the downtown Scottsdale bars. I know, no one walks in Scottsdale...but you could if you stayed at the Ho..."}
{"text":"Service was quite slow at the restaurant, and in general the front desk staff wasn't very cheery. I will say that the pool/bar staff was excellent.  The most inconvenient part of our stay was that our 2207 suite was advertised to accommodate 4, however, there is only one bed. We got the single roll away but that meant one person needed to sleep on the couch.  When I approached the front desk staff about this issue he stated, \"yeah, we get that a lot. There's nothing I can do to help.\" If this is happening quite a bit, maybe the advertising for the room should state that it only sleeps 2 and not 4. This was very frustrating. Overall I would stay again, but be leery of wording regarding the rooms."}
{"text":"My wife and I took a nice drive up to Scottsdale AZ to attend the Chihuly Glass Art Exhibit at the Scottsdale Botanical Gardens, WOW incredible a definite must see...Anyway on to the Hotel...

We choose to stay at the Valley Ho after reading a wonderful review in Sunset Magazine.  Much to our surprise it exceeded our expectations.

The hotel was a beautiful Retro style but totally modernized after a major remodel.  The staff was very helpful and very nice.  Our room was very clean and fabulous, the beds were very comfortable and the HD Plasma was nice too to watch the Masters on : ) . 

The Grounds were well manicured with beautiful flowers and seating areas all around to enjoy the fountains.

We ate at the local restaurants, ZUZU and Trader Vic's.  ZUZU was great for breakfast, their spanish Omlette was incredible and the service was top notch.  Trader Vic's was a fun restaurant and I enjoyed the Chefs Special which was a wonderful Striped Marlin that was flown in fresh from Hawaii.

Overall we had a Fabulous time at the HO and we will definitely be back to indulge once again.  I will definitely recommend this to Friends and Family."}
{"text":"Best hotel...always a great time!  Thanks Rob & Pete."}
{"text":"The room was comfortable and clean. It kind of has a retro feel to it. Pretty good for a one night stay."}
{"text":"My favorite hotel in Scottsdale. Style, flair, and a location you can't beat. It's completely unique to anything you would stay in- definitely worth a visit. Great rates to boot."}
{"text":"The Valley Ho is absolutely amazing! I stayed there this past weekend, for the first time, and loved everything about it. The room was ADORABLE, super clean and the bed was insanely comfortable. The pool was a blast, with amazing service! I can't wait to come back, soon!"}
{"text":"the valley ho - yea, the ho of the valley. 

who says you can't turn a ho into a housewife? this ho went through such an awesome transition from seedy motel (which once was a great motel in it's hey-day, the 50s-60s) to ultra modern hipster hotel.

my boyf and i stayed there for 1 night for new years eve and we had such a great experience. the room was ultra modern and 60s mod at the same time. it felt like i was in a sea-green and blue-green spaceship in the 60s. i felt like the rat pack was hanging out in the enclosed courtyard pool area, smoking lucky strikes and ordering up mai thais. the set-up is still reminiscent of a motel (outdoor stairwells, all rooms in a circle around a courtyard and a detached main lobby/restaurant/other hotel stuff), but with nicer rooms. the lobby is very old and modern phoenix at the same time. the lobby bar is a great hangout and the outdoor area that has a fireplace and some tables and couches is great for chilly desert nights.

ho it up in the valley...this place is classy not trashy."}
{"text":"This hotel is so much fun. I live not even a mile away and it was the perfect stay-cation. The rooms are a perfect size, beds are incredibly comfortable. My favorite part was the pool and pool bar. There is a DJ on the weekends which made the whole experience that much better. Also, the hotel is Dog friendly which made it really convenient for us so we didn't have to board him. Once we checked in the brought us a dog blanket, bowl, treats, doggy bags and a toy. I would recommend anyone to stay here."}
{"text":"We visited the Valley Ho this past weekend for a bachelor party planning to take advantage of the \"hip\" pool scene and enjoy a nice weekend among friends.  When our group arrived, we loaded our luggage as well as a hefty amount of adult beverages onto a luggage cart and made our way to the rooms.  I'd like to point out that there were 14 bigger guys on this trip and we were planning to stay for 3 days.  

We did not try to cram into rooms and had reserved 4 standard 2 double bed rooms along with a large suite.  No later than 15 minutes after checking in there was a knock at the door by the 5'6\" head of security Mike that has an obvious small mans complex.  When we asked if we had already been too loud and received a noise complaint he responded politely with a \"No, we just noticed you gentlemen brought a large amount of alcohol with you and we wanted to remind you of our no party policy\".  While we did have a large amount of booze on board it was for 14 people for 3 days!  Good start to the trip and great first impression.

We brushed Mike off, had a couple of cocktails and headed down to the pool.  It was a Friday afternoon so there were a fair amount of people but not overly crowded.  They have daily drink specials including buckets of beer so for a \"trendy\" hotel drinks were definitely reasonable.  There were several groups of people tossing a nerf football across the pool to each other and the crowd was having a good time with it.  That is, until Mike decided to show up, cell phone and maglite attached to his belt at the hip.  He made a nice \"hey I'm open\" gesture with his arms making everyone think he wanted to join in the fun.  Maybe he wasn't on such a power trip after all and we had misread him?  Unfortunately, we were wrong and when someone tossed him the ball he promptly took it away like an 8th grade bully.  He didn't seem to mind all of the boos from the crowd as I am sure he is used to them by now.  We made the best of the rest of the afternoon and went on to enjoy our evening out in Scottsdale.

The Saturday pool party we had heard about was what we were really looking forward to since we had heard it was one of the new hot spots in town.  When we arrived at the pool we see a security line set up like it was a Vegas night club.  Looked promising until we see our friend Mike working the door.  None of us realized prior to the trip that only hotel guests were allowed in.  This is the first time I have heard of this and one of the reasons The W down the street is a much better option.

We had reserved a cabana and the service staff all day was awesome.  This review is in no way a reflection on them but simply management and security.  
When we had finally settled into the cabana area we notice that there is coincidentally a security guard posted just outside of it on the corner.  Sweet.  Thanks Mike.

I am not going to try and pretend that the group of guys we were with was this quiet bunch of friends looking for a relaxing day at the pool.  We had come for the \"Hottest Day Party In Scottsdale\" we had read about and they also try to advertise.  Several of the friends in the group get extremely rowdy but in a fun way that always gets the crowd going and laughing as well.  After the first hour the crowd had been won over and everyone was having a good time.

Our cabana had come with a bunch of pool toys including a blow up beach ball.  That ended up in the pool for about 2 minutes until good old Mike could scamper over, take it away from some other patrons and remove it from the party.  Why the hell did you give it to us in the first place then?  Once again the boos from the crowd didn't seem to phase him.  On at least 5 occasions there were moments with other groups that also drew the same types of reactions.

We made the best of the day, despite the fact that the DJ sucked, and all started to head back up to the room.  Our next wonderful experience occurred when we were making the 30 foot walk from the poolside door of the lobby to the elevators.  Halfway through we hear a screeching voice screaming at 2 people in our group to put their shirts on.  At this point of the day we definitely responded with some smart ass comment as we had had enough.  I told the woman manager that this was the worst hotel experience I had ever had and her response was \"then why don't you stay somewhere else next time\".  No problem there.

The only positives are that the rooms were nice, the staff at the pool other than security was awesome.  The rooms with two beds have full beds so if you plan on having 2 people in 1 it is not going to be comfortable.

Other than the room and the staff, Mike sucked, management sucked, pool party and DJ sucked.  Luckily the group we went out there with can make anywhere we are at a good time or we would have been even more disappointed.

Have fun."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our 3-night stay here during the weekend of the PGA golf tournament. The rooms were expensive but we didn't know that it was the golf weekend - we were there for a girls weekend. Bummer that it wasn't warmer, but all the staff we encountered here, particularly the front desk and valet, were really great.  The bartender and waitress in the restaurant, not super great. The beds were not the most comfortable, but we really liked our basic room, cleanliness and the food at the restaurant. We had a dinner and breakfast at ZuZu and both were very good.

Also noteworthy, was Judy at the activities/concierge desk. She was very helpful and nice. Small touches like being delivered ice water at the pool and free bottled water from the valet make you feel like they are not nickle-and-dimeing you every step of the way. They also had some good deals on spa services but unfortunately our schedule didn't allow us to get in. But the staff there was very nice also. I'd definitely stay here again. 

One more thing... I feel like I want to mention again how great the valet staff was. They really stood out for me. They were always friendly and seemed willing to go out of their way to be personable and helpful, without being stuffy."}
{"text":"Hi Yelpers!

I love the HVH! Went there 5 years ago, after a miserable Boston winter. Skip ahead to the sci-fi-esque horrible winter of 2015, I fled to Scottsdale in the 1st week of April. Bliss!

I arrived as a total burnout and left refreshed. This is why:

1) Valley Ho has the customer service thing elevated to a science.

2) Archie at the front desk rocked. I was charmed by Danielle at ZuZu. The restaurant manager is fantastic, classy and very personable. (Plus she has relatives in Boston!)

3) Pool staff rock. I asked for a killer Margarita, and was not disappointed.

Taking one of Arnold's lines: I'll be back!!

Valley Ho rocks!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding from the minute I walked in to the minute I left. Entire staff friendly..Rooms was large and I loved the 60s decor. I had a pool view on 5th floor and it wasnt until I opened my balcony door that I noticed the poolside dj..great soundproofing..had the mussels and grilled cheese that were both really good..Especially lived the barstaff. They created such a welcoming atmosphere that it brought the bar patrons together. .altough I went there alone, I felt like I was hanging out with a group of long lost friends..great proximity to Old Town shopping and eats..also loved the hair and skin products...cant wait to go back..."}

{"text":"The pool at the Vally Ho is great! Awesome atmosphere and excellent service. The music and DJ Pbody were perfect. I celebrated my birthday there and I will always remember what a fun time we had. Thank you Hotel Valley Ho!"}
{"text":"Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood got hitched here.  I used to come here when I was in high school and it was outdated and uncool.  We would go to the bar and the cocktail waitress would wear an orange brownish shade of panty hose and brings us watered down house vodka mixed with Tang for happy hour. We also used to steal the TP to decorate our friends house's.  Now it is cool again when they remodeled and it's a cool twist of retro and modern."}
{"text":"Stayed here the second weekend in March with my 2 adult daughters.  I was in Scottsdale for a conference at the hotel & my daughters planned to go to the Cactus League spring training games.  

First, the good.  Basically, we loved this hotel.  It's a beautiful, architecturally unique property with gorgeous palm trees, flowers and interesting landscaping.  The rooms are lovely.  Our first room faced an unattractive parking lot & the front desk immediately moved us to a prettier room when I politely requested a change.  The desk staff is friendly, efficient and a lot of fun.  Kudos front desk.

The pool is fabulous although our experience was probably better because the weather was beautiful but the crowd pretty light.  I'm guessing it may be a different experience when all the chairs are full.  But the pool is lovely, food/bar service terrific.  We loved our lizard day sunning by the pool.

Rooms are really nice.  Spacious, airy, great amenities, super bathroom.  Room service was prompt and food delicious.

We also loved the Zuzu restaurant & bar.  The hotel's concierge was kind of the opposite of friendly/helpful, so we didn't really find any Scottsdale restaurants or bars that we liked better than Zuzu.  So we hung out there.  A lot.  Zuzu's menu is simple but varied with really well-prepared food.  The wait staff and bartenders are young, friendly, funny & talented.  The weekend of our stay, the hotel was busy with my conference people, a couple of bachelorette parties and lots of spring training baseball fans.  Everyone hung around the Zuzu bar all evening.  It was pleasantly noisy, fun experience.

My only criticism other than the grumpy concierge was the spa.  It is beyond horrible.  Really, really awful.  My daughters live in another city & mani/pedis are one of our favorite girlie routines whenever we get together.  The spa only does one mani/pedi at a time.  What?  What fun is a mani/pedi all by yourself? I should have known better but it was downhill from there.  First, the mani/pedi is \"dry.\"  OK, Arizona is dry.  Really dry.  Nothing feels better than a warm bubblebath for your toes.  Why would anyone want a dry mani/pedi? I've never had a \"professional\" dry mani/pedi.  Never again.  Basically, it's a lady putting nail polish on dirty hands & feet.  Disgusting.  There's  a limited color selection & the spa is so dark it wasn't until I got outside that I saw I'd picked a polish with sparkles.  Also, the wax lady is vocal about not being \"comfortable\" doing bikini waxes.  What?  Oh, and there's the mandatory 20% gratuity.  Shameful.  There were multiple bachelorette parties at the hotel when I was there -- why would you not have a decent nail service and an aesthetician who doesn't recoil at the idea of a bikini wax?  The whole \"spa experience\" was gross, overpriced and not guest-friendly."}
{"text":"I LOVE this hotel. I've stayed here at least 3 times for work meetings. 

Each time I've stayed in a 2 bed room. I find the rooms very spacious, CLEAN, and unique compared to any hotel I've stayed in. There is a little backyard bit with chairs and an ashtray to enjoy the outdoors. It's almost like your own little resort. 
The bathroom made my jaw DROP--the shower is separate from the bath, and to this day I still dream about the bathtub. Its a nice big soaker. Make sure to stop off at the local LUSH to grab some goodies to use in the bath ;)
The sink is one of those neat-o stand out ones and there are all the luxuries you need like cotton pads and q-tips. Oh, how I love the simple things!
In the room itself it has a desk and chair, and a vanity area with a full-room length mirror as well as a make-up mirror. It's every girly-girls DREAM for getting ready at. I can spread out all my make-up and hair tools!

The staff are all friendly and helpful wherever you go in the hotel.

The meeting rooms are fabulous and air-conditioned. There are lots of different venues and nooks and crannies which make the type of work meetings we have super special and creative.

The food is fabulous and inexpensive--a real treat compared to most hotels. I've only ordered room service a couple times and it was usually pretty quick and downright delicious.

The ONLY reason I couldn't give this place a 5 star rating was the first time I stayed there an employee/or employees (I never got the full story) stole my credit card info and luckily my bank noticed obscure charges and cancelled my card immediately (and inconveniently as I was just about to make a trip into the US and had no USD only my credit card)

You'd think that'd be reason enough to never want to go back but this hotel is just that awesome I go back anyway! I can't wait to book a vacation here sometime.

I highly, highly recommend Hotel Valley Ho!"}
{"text":"really nice facility room service is amazing food is delicious, whats left to say???"}
{"text":"Beautiful hotel! My husband and I checked in after our wedding and the concierge upgraded us to an amazing suite. The staff was courteous, professional, and friendly. We also enjoyed a couples massage at the VH Spa. It was exceptional. Very clean and beautiful facilities. We can't wait to visit Hotel Valley Ho again!"}
{"text":"Mr. B and I stayed here over the weekend to celebrate is 21st Burt-day again (hee hee). We had such a blast! The 50's deco is absolutely gorgeous. I opted for their 10th Anniversary Special which included a room upgrade for a measly $10 (score), 2 complimentary drinks, and a $10 resort credit to use as we pleased. (Yes, we used it at the bar!). Upon arrival the staff was extremely pleasant. From the valets when we drove up to the guy who checked us in. Nothing but smiles and courteous service. 5 stars for the service.

Our room, was so awesome! We had a studio room that was the perfect size. The tub in the center of the room was the best feature (I've asked for one just like it at home), which we THOROUGHLY enjoyed. The room accommodations were quite spacious. If you have the option, select an upgrade. 

For a Sunday the pool was full but not overly packed, which we definitely appreciated. We were able to grab two chairs close to the pool steps and still take a dip without feeling crowded. The service at the pool was good as well. We were going out to dinner, which we didn't want to spoil, so we opted for chips with queso, salsa and guacamole. Surprisingly, the guac was very tasty. It wreaked of freshness and the right amount of everything that makes a good guac (5 stars ZuZu!). The salsa was decent, could've used a tad bit of salt, but it was devoured all the same. The queso was great as well. It had a mixture of black olives, and either green chiles or jalapenos (they weren't spicy so, we couldn't tell). Nonetheless it was still good. I enjoyed 2 Blackberry Mules (damn tasty) while Mr. B. had a Cadillac Rita (their house name I'm unsure at the moment) and one of their specialty drinks of the day. So, 4 drinks and an appetizer cost me all of $17 (remember, I had 2 comp drinks and a $10 resort credit. SCORE!). 5 Stars for the food and beverage hook-up.

The overall experience of the hotel was great! It was clean, beautiful and the staff was courteous and friendly, which made us feel very welcome. We will DEFINITELY come back for another stay-cation. Perhaps we'll try out the Tower (insert double air fist here)."}
{"text":"My wife and I went over to Phoenix for a get-away weekend.  We could not get a room and the more traditional resort names (Hyatt, Hilton, etc.).  I saw the reviews for Valley Ho so we decided to go for it.  We reserved the Cabana King room for two nights.  Great room, fun and different decor, terrific service at the pool.   The waitresses are very attentive and helpful.  Our gal at the pool became our concierge for restaurants and places to go.  The pool has plenty of chairs, towels and even had a live band Friday evening.  

The location to Old Scottsdale made for a great morning walk for breakfast or coffee and central to all of Scottsdale.  I used the gym facility as well, great equipment and plenty of towels and headphones.

This classic old hotel has been updated without losing its nostalgia and still offering a modern level of service.  

We will definitely stay there again."}
{"text":"I found the staff to be friendly & helpful. But the rest of the hotel was like a Holiday Inn with 1950's decor. Nothing really special or fun. I will say my room was large & comfortable. But my biggest COMPLAINT is the VERY VERY loud band playing for the Battle of the Burgers event. This VERY loud annoying band played until just after 9:30 in a THURSDAY night. I'm no fuddy duddy. But I booked this $350+ a night room because I expected a nice place to rest & relax. I didn't expect a fraternity party. I won't stay here again."}
{"text":"Very Hip Hotel and Comfortable ~ Amazing location ~Great Staff all is good at the Valley HO !!!"}
{"text":"When we have guests visit we always recommend the Valley Ho. It's a great spot in old town Scottsdale, walking distance from delicious restaurants and shops. Their pool scene can be more of a \"party\" on Saturdays but they have a smaller pool to escape the scene if you want to relax. Love the restaurant / bar as well. If you're having brunch at the restaurant - get the grapefruit! It's wonderful!"}
{"text":"Loved it! We just spent 3 nights at Valley Ho and had a wonderful time. The hotel has everything you need without being fussy - and its location to old town Scottsdale cannot be beat. We have stayed in luxury hotels all over the world, and found Valley Ho to be quaint and loved the retro décor. If you are looking for a Four Seasons experience then this may not be the place for you, but if you are hoping to simply get away, hang out in the sun and get great (and inexpensive) drinks poolside then this will be perfect. Think of it more as a funky-retro boutique than a swanky luxury resort. It has all of the cool factor without any of the stuffiness."}
{"text":"I was guest at this hotel during the summer.  I have to say that the pool is a great place to relax, if it is not a Saturday during the summer.  I am not into pool clubs, and this place is filled with the typical Scottsdale clubbers that I was hoping to avoid.  Sunday was a better choice for relaxing by the pool.

The hotel first put us in a room that was not in the main tower.  This was a bad choice, because they had a party/wedding or something  directly below us and we could not sleep.  I have to give the hotel credit though, they almost instantly switched us when we called and complained.  Good customer service.  

The decor was better in the main tower.  More modern, spacious, and updated.  If I stay here again, I will only stay in the main tower.  Overall, a great place to stay.  Convenient to shops, restaurants, and everything one would want."}
{"text":"This is a great hotel to stay in if you want to enjoy an intown vaca and basically use the killer pool. It has a funky vibe with retro decor and the rooms are pretty spacious. Plus you're walking distance or a very cheap cab ride away from some of Scottsdale's hottest clubs.

We spent a recent Saturday night here just to spend a leisurely weekend afternoon lying by the pool. Young and beautiful people were kicking back with frozen cocktails and enjoying the outside digs. There's also several cabanas you can rent if you want to throw down some extra money and have a shaded area. You'll be surprised by how many people stay here just to use the pool!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Valley Ho 3 years ago for my hubby's birthday, when I saw a special they were running back in May I knew I had to book a room for his birthday this year. I booked a studio room, which is a bit larger than the signature room & also has an amazing bathtub. I discovered that they allow dogs, so we had to bring our lil maltese Angel with us! Upon entering our room I noticed a doggy bowl with food & water & lil pink bags to pick up her you know what, I thought that was a nice touch. We had dinner reservations, but not for another couple hours, so we ordered some food. From Cafe ZuZu we got the grilled cheese that came with house made chips, onion rings & 2 cokes. The grilled cheese was yummy, as were the chips. The onion rings were more like onion strings & not something I'd order again. Total (including a 20% tip) was about $27, not too bad for room service. The beds & pillows are so comfy, as are the over sized robes! We love the retro feel with some modern twists, such as the sink & lighting fixtures. The shower & tub are great & big enough for 2 (or 3 if you're into that). The bathroom amenities are nice too, red flower brand. The flat screen tvs are nice as well with free (?) wi-fi. The balconies are nice & big too with a padded lounge chair & small table with 2 chairs. I have had dinner twice at Trader Vic's in the past & enjoyed it. I would like to try out their spa next time. I look forward to future staycations at the Ho!"}
{"text":"The valley ho is actually a nice place to stay but when planning a wedding here make sure u clear up everything with management"}
{"text":"Had better service at motel 6. Advised front desk of drunk patrons kicking my tires while awaiting valet with my toddler.  Front said \"I'm sorry to hear\", then walked away. Dirty towels and bed linen did me in... going back Motel 6 on next visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this hotel twice now. Our first time here was amazing! I loved it so much that when he had to come to the area again for business I immediately booked a room at Hotel Valley Ho. When we arrived we where given a room with a pool view (as requested) but it did not have a tub (main reason for coming back). I called the front desk and they immediately moved us to another room that had a tub, and a partial view of the pool. I was happy! Then I went to use the tub. I filled it part of the way and got in. After a few seconds the water became freezing cold and then would go scolding hot. This continued for several minutes on and off till I finally had to shut the water off. I contacted the front desk and they said they would have someone come look at it and fix it. Thinking this issue was only a tub problem I used the shower instead and had the same thing. As far as I know no one ever came to look into the problem. We stayed here 4 nights Monday-Friday. Everything else was really nice and everyone was very accommodating but I was very disappointed that I could not use the tub like I had hoped and I feared getting in the shower."}
{"text":"Pros: quick check in, big room, great bathroom, very clean, really good breakfast and service at ZuZu

Cons: small beds (haven't stayed in a room with two doubles in a long time, the size of the room easily could have accommodated two queens), having to wait for a pool chair on Saturday at 4pm, being required to purchase tickets to the pool party on Sunday even though we were registered guests of the hotel.  

Overall, the hotel is really clean and in fantastic condition for how old the buildings are. The decor is a perfect combination of retro and modern and service was good.  However, the pool experience was extremely disappointing and completely took away from the stay.  If I'm looking for a one day party, I'll know where to go, but if I'm looking for a staycation with ample pool time, I'll go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Very nice, clean, and warm hotel. Staff was friendly and offered complementary water bottles to guest. Judy the concierge was knowledgable about the area providing different suggestions. The hotel has a upscale motel feel to it though as the rooms are outside away from the dining, fitness center, and front lobby. Our room had an enclosed balcony on the other side of our room, perfect for lounging for a bit in the sun. Would recommend staying here."}
{"text":"This was a great place when Marsha worked her. New management is ruining the vibe. Marsha embodied the feel of the era, but now just power hungry management."}
{"text":"I've stayed at the Ho a couple times and it never fails to exceed my expectations.

This past time I brought my dog with me and it was like a staycation for him as well. Walking the grassy grounds, getting spoiled with treats from the concierge and sun bathing on the patio was just what we needed to relax. 

I love booking a weekend with friends because whether it's a trip to get ice or a pop-in/pop-out of Zuzu I always spot someone I know and feel like a million bucks.

Their boutique gym is also unexpectedly tranquil. Great view and there's a mini studio space to stretch, do yoga or jump rope. 

Next time I definitely want to cruise around Old Town on their beach cruisers (or bring my own bike!) as well as hit up the rooftop patio.

The Valley Ho can do no wrong in my mind."}
{"text":"Update from Last Review: Customer Service at Valley Ho continues to astonish me. The staff is unable to own up to their shortcomings, and instead of correcting it, they blame the paying customer. 

I was planning on continuing to enjoy the bar and food from Valley Ho after having a bad night there, but after the arrogant responses from Jessie T, I plan on never coming back. 

Sorry Valley Ho, we're breaking up. For good."}
{"text":"I've never stayed at Valley Ho but ZuZu's is a great place for happy hour.  You can sit outside with a view of the 50's style pool area or inside, all are decorated from the 50's era.  Happy Hour:  everything is $3:00 and the prime rib sandwiches and yummy artisan grilled cheese sandwiches with pear are enough to fill you up.  There's a wide variety of drinks to choose from and the blackberry gin Bramble and the hot & dirty martini were really good.   I suggest valet parking."}
{"text":"I had a GREAT experience at the Hotel Valley Ho for one night.  The food was good, the atmosphere was fun and the room was very tranquil.  I am hoping to get a chance to go back soon."}
{"text":"Dog owners rejoice!!!  The Hotel Valley Ho welcomes dogs of any size!  Yes, I said ANY size!  

We were visiting the Scottsdale area for the holidays, and typically, we put our German Shepherd in overnight boarding but we couldn't resist her sad doe eyes just staring at us while we were packing.  So, my search for dog-friendly hotels began, and let me tell you, there are not many hotels in the Scottsdale area that accept dogs, let alone large dogs.  

The Mrs. previously stayed at the Hotel Valley Ho and recalled seeing some dogs roaming around the lobby so I checked out the website and a tab detailing how pets are welcome.  I didn't see any size restrictions, but just to make sure I called up the Ho and asked if our Shepherd could stay in our room...to which the rep said \"sure, no problem.\"  Bingo!  And BTW, they do not charge you an extra fee to bring your pooch with you...

Curiously enough...the Hotel Valley Ho was offering the same discounted rates as Expedia so I just booked directly through their site, which was easy to use. 

If you've ever seen that movie 'Blast From the Past,' this place is reminiscent of the 50's era.  Kinda kitchy, but well done.  Check in was a breeze and they upgraded us to a King studio room at no extra charge which was a welcome surprise.  Both the valet and busboy were prompt and friendly.  We were put on the 1st floor of one of the outer wings which was a little trek from the lobby, but well worth it since that wing was surrounded by lush grassy areas and was close to the rear self-parking lot.  BTW, valet parking is ($16 incl. tax), but self-parking is free and spaces were pretty abundant during our stay.  

The King Studio is a large open room...long counter on the left side of the wall, flat screen TV, an oval tub sitting by itself off to the right leading into an open bathroom with segregated toilet and shower, a very comfortable lounge chair, and a small table with a desk chair.  Toiletries were by Red Flower.  The back of the room is exposed to a large sliding glass door which opens up to a large patio with a table, chairs and lounge chair.  Like I said, perfect for us since the patio opened up to a large grassy area making our Shepherd's bathroom breaks a relative breeze.  The design/decor is 50's style with unusual colors that seem to work with the theme of the Ho.  The room was spacious enough for the two of us and our large Shepherd and it never felt cramped.   Room temp is controlled by a digital thermostat.  Room also had a Melita(?) coffee maker which actually made some pretty damn good coffee using those Melita coffee pods.   

The bed was very comfortable and tended toward the softer side in support.  There are 4 king size pillows that stacked perfectly for head/neck support.  Oddly enough, there was no sheet in between the duvet and the mattress sheet, but it appears they change out the duvet cover for every new guest.  Ours looked/smelled freshly laundered and had nice crisp pleats on it.  

Surprisingly, their room service from the hotel's restaurant ZuZu was a real treat.  We ordered a late night snack upon arrival and breakfast on most of our days, and unlike most hotels, they promptly delivered ALL of our room service meals within 20 minutes of ordering.  Wow!  So, everything was still hot/warm and fresh.  

The grilled chicken breast and vegetables were outstanding.  The chicken was nicely grilled, but still moist and tender, and the assortment of roasted vegetables was surprisingly diverse and tasty.  The breakfast egg white omelet was filled with broccolini, caramelized onions and roasted tomatoes and was surprisingly delicious.  The omelet was accompanied with an assortment of sliced cantaloupe, pineapple and honeydew.  They charge a 20% service charge which includes tip which is pretty standard. 

Housekeeping was prompt and always left extra towels and toiletries upon request.  Also, on Christmas Eve, they left a plate of soft Gingerbread cookies in our room...nice touch.  

Not for nothing and ignore this if you don't own a dog...but we brought our own poo bags for our Shepherd since we religiously pick up after our dog, but the hotel provides poo bags at no cost upon request.  So, I wonder why some hotel guests with dogs still felt the need to let their dogs sh*t on the Hotel Valley Ho's pristine grass (which is really hard to keep in AZ heat) and not pick it up.  Lazy folks who don't pick up after their dogs are just friggin savages!  This hotel is kind enough to take dogs of any size and it's douche-bags like you that will ruin it for everyone else.  PICK UP AFTER YOUR FRIGGIN DOG! 

Anyways, the one notable flaw of our stay was that the bed was on a platform frame and the green cloth covering the frame was dirty/stained (from shoe marks?) pretty much all the way around.  

Solid 4.5 stars.  Docked a half a star for the dirty bed frame, but we will definitely stay at the Ho again with our Sheph"}
{"text":"1st rate in every sence.  If you love art deco, you'll love the Valley Ho.  The property has the grace, elegance and ambiance of a bygone era....  Add great hospitality and you have Hotel Valley Ho!  Not just a hotel, it's an experience......"}
{"text":"LOVE this hotel! 
From location, beautiful rooms, amenities, decor and ambiance, to service and comfort. Walking distance to countless restaurants, shops and galleries. A few minutes drive from the nightlife district. Friendly staff, decent food at the restaurant, great gym and of course the pool! Not super busy when we went in July 2014 but that might be the season - so if you're looking for an everyday party place in the summer, this is not it (not sure about other times of the year). But if you're looking for a great hotel to relax in, this is it!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for style at a reasonable price, the Valley Ho is it!  Yes, you can stay at a chain hotel with perfectly decent rooms nearby for less.  You can also stay at a one of the big Scottsdale resorts for A LOT more. 

Check in/out is nice and efficient, and the valet guys are super helpful, even if you don't have a car.  The beds are comfortable, and the bathtub in my room was deep enough that I probably could have dove into it.  The only thing missing (unless I somehow didn't see it) was a full length mirror.  Valley Ho powers that be, please add one before I come back to visit next year. :)

The hotel is also within walking distance of many good restaurants, coffee shops, etc., if you want to venture outside of the hotel to eat.  There's also a Circle K just across the parking lot, that came in handy for the occasional soda/candy bar craving (and for one of my friends who inadvertently forgot to pack ALL his toiletries).  If you don't mind a little longer walk, Scottsdale Fashion Square is just a couple of miles away.  The hotel's location is convenient to so much that you really don't need to rent a car if you're coming for a business conference at the Valley Ho."}
{"text":"So rooms have been renovated with a shopping spree at IKEA. They are neat and clean, however, not a fan of the sliding doors for the bathroom. Seems the rooms closer to Trader Vics are slightly larger than the ones closer to the pool. 

The hotel restaurant provides huge portions and great service. 

The pool is the center piece of this place literally and figuratively. The pool  itself is nothing spectacular. They try to make a pseudo vegas environment. DJ comes in the afternoon and lots of alcohol is served. The people (characters?) are what makes this place unique. I felt like I was in the middle of an open casting call for the next cast of the Jersey Shore. 

Also, we rented a cabana for the sole purpose of having shade. The roof was hooked up so their were gaps and they wouldn't let us close the curtain for shade. I wouldn't recommend shelling out $500 for one of these. 

They also get a bit nazi with their bracelets and pool entrance on the weekends. The side entrances are tied shut (I'm thinking this is a hazard). There are always at least three people at the front entrance. You must wear a bracelet just to walk around the pool and a second one for the cabana. Why two? If I have a cabana bracelet doesn't that mean I'm allowed into the pool area?

Apparently, the hotel does not like outside cabs. They have a deal going with a car service. So you are forced to spend about 25% more than you would with a cab. I'm guessing that 25% is going back to the hotel."}
{"text":"This was by far, the weirdest, hippest, coolest, trendiest hotel I've stayed at in awhile. The rooms are decked out like I Dream of Jeanie's bottle or an episode of The Twilight Zone. You can feel the history here. Staff was great, food was great, view from the roof was great, pool looked great, all in all - pretty great. 

So why only three stars? Because the wi-fi was TERRIBLE!!!!! I couldn't login when I got there or even the next morning, and then when I was able to get connected, it was SLOW and I got kicked off the wi-fi all the time! I depend on the internet to do my job, so this was a big deal for me. If you're here on vacation, no big deal. But I found it very very frustrating. 

Internet junkies be warned - this may not be the hotel for you.

-------------

Update: after posting this review, the manager reached out to me to find out exactly what kinds of problems I had with the wi-fi while I was there and seems very interested to fix the issue.  I'm impressed and adding another star to my review."}
{"text":"What a great hotel.  Totally unique and the customer service is top notch.  ZuZu has some great food choices as well.  With live music on Friday, DJ on Saturday, build your own Bloody Mary bar on Sunday, and bar service at the pool, there is no need to leave the grounds once you arrive.  If you've never been, you're missing out!!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriends did a stay cation here over Memorial Day weekend and had a blast!  We took advantage of the Sunday Spa special for $99 dollars. What aGREAT deal but even better was the quality of the service at this spa. This is A MUST go spa!  I thought I got lucky to have such a good massage therapist, which doesn't happen so often at resort, but when me and the girls met for our \"complimentary\" champagne in the lounge everyone RAVED about the skill set of their therapist. This was THE BEST massage I have ever received!  You must ask for Wesley or Whisley ( not 100% on the name) but really, it sounds like all of them are top notch. I was impressed and we will be back soon to experience this amazing spa again. I would have never guessed for Valley Ho to have such a great spa, but they knock it out of the park in this area!"}
{"text":"Superb experience. From the polite, attentive, and courteous welcome from Mike, lovely help from the front desk, and then a beautiful quiet room with pool view. We stayed in 4 hotels in four days on this trip, each requesting a crib for our baby. The Hotel Valley Ho was the only one to give us baby supplies, too. Above and beyond service. I'd definitely look forward to staying here again."}
{"text":"I have always loved the Valley hotel property.  As a local Scottsdale event planner, I have booked countless meetings and guest rooms.  Over the past 5 years I have spent well over $100,000.  I had scheduled a spa day for my best friend and I for her birthday.  After I pulled into the parking lot spot, my vehicle was hit by one of their landscapers racing by in his cart.  The driver tried to pass on my passenger door side and clipped it with his cart, continued to drive dragging my door and causing over $4,000 in damage.  Not only did we miss our spa appointments, but I was stuck there to handle everything on my own with the police, the landscaper that didn't speak English and a security guard who didn't say a word.  No one at the hotel offered any assistance and they are now REFUSING to pay for the damages, even after I have a detailed police report from the scene.  This is certainly not the kind of customer service I was expecting from a 4 star property.  I certainly wouldn't be getting this type of service from any of their competitors down the street.  From this point on, I will never book another meeting, send another customer, or recommend this hotel to anyone.  I hope this $4,000 dispute was worth all of this business to them."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Valley Ho to attend Giants spring training games and we had a great time!  Highly recommend the hotel and staff.  The hotel is located nearby Main Street where you can walk to all the restaurants in a very safe area of Scottsdale.  You have to check in with the Ace the Concierge - she knows exactly what you should see and where you should go!  Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"a very cool joint. warm, friendly staff. solid food + beverage.  great feel, location and overall hospitality. i'll be back!"}
{"text":"We stayed here for a couple of nights and I was very impressed. This hotel has great style and they take it back old school with revamped midcentury modern furnishings. The rooms were nice and we loved the huge tub in the room--but this would be a little awkward if you are sharing a room with someone you are not too comfortable with because there is only a curtain separating the room and the bathroom. However, you could book a different room with more privacy. The balcony/patio is great as well which overlooks the pristine grounds which at times felt a little like Hawaii.. I will say the customer service is also the best we have experienced in a long time. Everyone is so friendly --it was wonderful! I would definitely book this hotel again. Oh and the scent they use after they clean your room is the best!"}
{"text":"Got more than what I asked for from the Valley Ho. Came for a weekend to enjoy Giants spring training and a bachelor party. The suite we had provided ample space and supplies for a preparty in the hotel room. 

The pool was nice everyday, and the staff was incredibly friendly. 

The hotel was centrally located in the middle of scottsdale. So we were a quick golf cart ride away from any bar or restaurant we wanted to visit. We were also walking distance from Scottsdale stadium. 

The bell staff was incredibly helpful and the housekeeping was extremely efficient.

The room service was awesome. We got back from being at the bars all night and essentially ordered everything on the menu. Everyone liked their meal. I had the burger and a side of sweet potato fries and both were excellent. 

5 stars for the valley ho"}
{"text":"Great retro hotel! Room rates are nothing to get excited about but the pool party is! Usually a line to get in, DJ in full force, full bar and food. You most likely need to know someone staying at the hotel if you're a local and want to get in."}
{"text":"I have been coming to VH every year for a weekend around my birthday for the past ten years. This year I was informed upon arrival that there's an $18 fee to park in their open parking lots.  Now I'm sure this looked like a golden opportunity for profit, but I feel it's a real hit to custom service.  Which, to that point, I feel with each passing year the focus to custom service is less and less here.   I'm sure they do a lot of business with locals during the summer like myself and I'm sure others have noticed.  This year, I will look to spend less each day I'm here in spite of the silly parking fee.  The hotel itself is awesome...I love the architecture and the history.  But like the hotel, the excellent custom service is part of its past.  I think my group will move the birthday weekend next year to a different resort.

{"text":"Design heaven.  You will feel like a rock star.  The design, friendliness, and sun will simultaneously soak into your soul and totally compensate for the fact that for some reason your are in Scottsdale, Arizona and you will be HAPPY!"}
{"text":"I drive my ass all the way from So Cal to partake in my buddies bachelor party with the HQ at the Valley Ho in Scottsdale. Pleasantly surprised with the decor, this place looks like what used to be a run down 60's motel / hotel that was rejuvenated by the folks who design the W hotels.

I will keep this short & sweet. The room that I crashed in was pretty awesome, huge wrap around deck. The pool was fun though the hotel has a immense emphahsis on security, almost to a fault. I get the feeling that something happened there because they check your room number so many times.

All in all it was a great time, we played hard out there and had a good environment to do it in."}
{"text":"Came here recently with the wife for a 3 day stay.  My wife was in town for business so I spent the majority of my days at the pool.  Our room was modern, mad men chic style with cool stand alone bath tub and glass door shower.  The only thing I didnt like about the room is that the bed has a 5 inch thick comforter blanket on it and thats it.  So basically you had to sleep with this sub arctic approved comforter over you, causing sweating and discomfort within 10 minutes, or nothing at all, because there was no sheet under it.  I called the front desk and they informed me that this was \"the style\" of the bed.  So let me get this straight, your hotel lies in one of the hottest climates in the country, and you basically force your guests to sleep with a comforter that would keep my grandma warm in an Alaskan igloo?  How about you provide a bed sheet so i can put it over me and sleep like a normal human being?  I digress.  I had breakfast a few times at the Zuzu cafe near the lobby, the food was awesome and the service was great.  The pool area was nice and quiet because we were there mid-week, the pool servers were friendly and not overbearing like at some hotels.  Had to bring my ipod though because they basically play the same top 40 songs on a loop all day.  I understand music is subjective, but at least vary the songs so your guests dont have to hear the exact same songs played every day.  Overall a great experience though and I would definitely come back here next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend Cannes here Saturday since our flight and cruise to Cuba got cancelled due to hurricane Irma this is our favorite place here in Scottsdale. Judy the concierge is always attentive and great. Travis is a great bartender at the inside bar and glad u have him he is attentive and goes above and beyond. The staff is amazing and is making our stay very enjoyable. Few names that I want to mention matt and Steve at the pool are great and it's a pleasure to be talking to them. We be here for 4 more days so I will get more names."}
{"text":"My daughter in law picked this place via yelp reviews and gotta say Loved the rooms and the service. Only two issues. I stayed near poolside and the band was loud and not so good. Lot of
20+ party people in the pool being 20+ which kept us from
taking the kids into the pool. Much quieter and low key after
dark."}
{"text":"I liked The Ho, but I think I'm a wee bit older than their target demographic.  The dance party at the pool on Saturday was a little too Daytona Beach for my taste, but Sunday's more laid-back island vibe was more my speed.  If you can afford to rent a cabana, do.  It's nice to have a shaded place to return to when the sun gets too hot, and the Miami Vices (half strawberry daiquiri and half pina colada) go to your head.

The food at all the restaurants was good, but not stellar.  And maybe I'm just used to Chicago portions, but I remember looking at the plate thinking, \"Where's the rest?\"

The rooms themselves were quite nice, with a mid-century modern feel.  The linens were soft, and the Red Flower Icelandic Moonflower toiletries smelled lovely.  BTW, you'd better like the scent because it is everywhere in The Ho -- including hand wash in the bathrooms at the pool and the restaurants. 

I have two complaints about the beds at The Ho. The first is that they are too small for two people who aren't snuggling.  If you're sleeping in the same bed as a friend, you'll need to switch positions in tandem.  The second is that they're a bit too soft.  At first they feel delightful, but after sleeping on them a few nights you'll want more support.

All in all, if you're 20something and single, this is a great place to stay."}
{"text":"Great location (walking distance to downtown restaurants).  Great midcentury decor and ambiance!  Beautiful landscaped grounds.  The restaurant had consistently excellent food and service.  Two pools: One for \"partying\" and a beautiful \"serenity pool\" away from the noise.  Rooms are beautifully appointed, clean.  Also pet friendly. Great hotel for an extended vacation, you feel like you are in a very special place!"}
{"text":"Stayed here on a business trip Mon 7/11 thru Thurs 7/14 and my experience was great! I researched other reviews before I decided on staying at this hotel since it appeared to be a party spot on the weekends. I called to make my reservation (instead of on line) and was assured that it would be quiet during the week. During the first night I heard a few people talking next door but not too late, other than that it was nice and peaceful the entire stay. I had a standard room and it was huge, decorated beautifully and I love the decor. Was looking for a different hotel with some character and this one definitely did not disappoint! I liked that every room has a balcony and a nice comfy lounge chair to enjoy outside. The mini bar was fully stocked. Beds were really comfy, and plenty of space for me to do work in the evenings. My only complaint (which was minor) was that I had a view of the empty dirt lot across the street which wasn't very pretty. It seemed like there weren't very many people staying at the hotel and I would have liked a room with courtyard view but by the time I got settled in my room, didn't feel like being moved. The bar and lounge area is comfy and there were lots of business travelers so it was a great environment. Ate dinner at the bar one night while I watched the baseball all star game on one of the flat screen tv's and food was really good. Service was excellent and staff really friendly. Valets were quick and service was excellent. I never had to wait for than 5 minutes for my car. My only regret is that I didn't have time to use the workout center but looked like nice equipment and it overlooked the pool through big glass windows. Location was excellent for me, it's within minutes of the 101 freeway. 

Overall great experience and I am planning to come back to this hotel on vacation with my husband. This is my spot to stay for all my business trips to AZ!"}
{"text":"Adorable. Huge bathroom and balcony. Pool is a bit of a scene - don't love the music streaming up from it. But that's ok. Really cute kitchy place."}
{"text":"I didn't stay at Valley Ho, but came here for a pool party that the DJ invited us to. It was so much fun!!!! I felt like I was taken back to the 60s. The drinks were good, the music was excellent, and it was a fun environment. A sand storm started rolling in so they had to stop the party a little early, but it was still a great time."}
{"text":"The staff here is wonderful!  I especially appreciated the pool staff as they were energetic and helpful.  The food here is so much better then one typically gets at hotels.  Even the buffets for conference meals were outstanding.  It is clean, updated and close to everything.  This is not a great place to go if you want views, as the mountains aren't visible from most areas.  They also have a mediocre spa.  The convenience and the beautiful landscaping made up for that.  I'd go five stars if they had a better spa."}
{"text":"What up Mad Men throwback! All of the details of this place are perfect! The lobby and lounge are great spaces to relax and travel back in time. There are two pools- one with a bumping party atmosphere and the other with a chill and relax by the pool vibe.  Both are necessary in my life so I was glad that both options were available.  The rooms have all the modern accommodations necessary for a 21st century gal, while sill rocking the mid 20th century vibe.  The bar area filled up and emptied out as various groups met for predrinks and then went about the city. The restaurant the next morning had rough service and only so-so food, but the hotel itself was great!"}
{"text":"I got married here at the rooftop of this renovated hotel and it was an unbelievable experience. I'll preface my review by saying that I'm extremely fortunate that my in-laws paid for our wedding (this place isn't cheap). The 360 degree view of the valley and Camelback Mountain on the roof was perfect for an Arizona wedding. Our reception was right downstairs. The wedding dinner prepared was lobster and seafood pasta and prime rib, and it was by far the best food served at a wedding that I've ever had. We had open bar at the wedding and the drinks were not watered down and well prepared. The rooms are a little too contemporary for my taste, but the suite we stayed in was cool. 

Aside from our wedding, I'll add a couple of notes. The pool is some good fun and was filled with pretty folks. Cafe ZuZu in the hotel is okay, but not worth the price. If you are coming from out of town and you are young and heading to the Scottsdale clubs this is a premier place."}
{"text":"Following a recent upgrade to the rooms, this is well worth the $169 per night I paid in October. A large open plan room, modern blue lighting, a neatly tucked away but spacious bathroom, and a huge bedroom that flows onto a cute little balcony big enough for a lounger and a table.

With the very reasonable restaurant Cafe Zuzu downstairs and the popular bar next to it, plus the frequently busy pool for people watchers, this is definitely an entertaining place to stay. Well worth the price!"}
{"text":"Stayed here multiple times for business, decided to spend a vacation weekend here.  Nothing worked out well.  Requested early check in (arrived in AZ at 9:00 AM) did not get into the room until almost 4:00 PM.  Yeah, I know its their \"policy\" that check in time is not guaranteed until 4:00 PM, but the kicker was that once we got into the room there were hairs all over the pillow on the bed. Disgusting.  So they hadn't bothered to change the sheets.  We had a cabana room because we thought it would be fun to be close to the pool, but what they don't tell you is that on Saturdays because of the obnoxious and crazy loud \"pool party,\" the access gate that is supposed to be available for the cabana room is locked down and inaccessible.  So no point in paying extra for the cabana room.  Real disappointment."}
{"text":"We loved our stay here! The front desk agent was so friendly and professional. Above and beyond in customer service all over this resort. The pool was a fun, lively atmosphere. Our room was clean and comfortable. We can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Yes management called and apologized for the miss happenings. We appreciated that very much."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm even giving one star is for the excellent Bell desk staff and the solid bartenders who worked the wedding reception.  The pool staff was very friendly as well.  They understand taking care of people.  It's unfortunate that the \"management team\", front desk and security staff need some remedial courses on how to treat guests.
A couple examples of how the wedding day started.  The maid of honor went to the trouble the afternoon before to confirm if we could check in earlier than 4:00PM for the bride's suite and the two story tower suite we had reserved.  The wedding was to start at 4:00 PM, so a number of us planned on arriving at the Valley Ho to enjoy some lunch at the property for a couple of hours and then get ready for the wedding.  They didn't have the bridal suite ready, so they put the bride and bridal party in one of the smallest resort rooms I've ever been in.  Mistake 1. We show up a little before 1:00PM and are told, sorry the tower suite isn't ready, and we'll expedite its cleanup. OK, so literally over two hours later, around 3:00 they finally have the room ready.  Keep in mind we have a wedding that starts in less than an hour now.  Ridiculous. Mistake 2.
I'm not going to beat a dead horse on what ensued the rest of the evening, up to and including security chomping at the bit to throw us out, and seemingly disappointed that I had cleared out the room per their earlier request, when they returned a second time. I'm *sure* the crack security team didn't confuse us with the raging bachelorette party going on three doors down from our room. You can read through other guest's feedback if you'd like more of the gory details.
I was pretty excited to stay at a place that has been a part of Scottsdale history.  I was looking forward to a great weekend.  Despite the management and security team's best efforts to be a wet blanket, the wedding still happened and we're all glad for that.
I suspect if you want a nice, quiet weekend experience alone or with one other person, in a mid-century motif property, that the Ho will be a nice fit.  Just make sure you're tucked in by 9:00PM.
If you want to have any kind of an event or group function here, I would certainly look at the many other options the valley has to offer.
Jessie T., save your canned response.  If you have something original and meaningful to say, by all means."}
{"text":"Man oh man. Ask and you shall receive. The place is an absolute delight. Have stayed here many times and will continue to. Great deals are the way to go. Every room is worth it. Hosted my 29 and 1/2 birthday party here. Upgraded room, complimentary drinks and food with personalized card. Make a connection with the staff and see great things come your way. Eat and much food as possible. The chicken quesadilla ordered from room service is my favorite quesadilla of all time. Book your stay in AZ here. Do it. Enjoy a boutique hotel that makes everyone feel like a celebrity."}
{"text":"I booked a business event here a few months ago and wanted to make sure I got my review in. The decor hits you right off with its old school glamour; this isn't your everyday cookie cutter I-could-be-in-California-I-could-be-in-Montana hotel. Honestly, I was extremely wary to book here (the name is called \"ho\" and it's got big pool parties.. not exactly business oriented) but my people were thrilled. Because it's NOT your normal hotel! The HVH has really mastered the line between funky and professional. 

Check in: A breeze! Enough small talk to make me feel welcome but was still FAST. As the crew checked in a small lined formed but it went quickly. 

Rooms: Plenty of counter and drawer space (so much counter space!), although the bathtub in the middle is just weird to me. I was not a fan. I don't take baths in hotels (ew) so I was more worried that I would trip over it at night. It does add a different vibe to the room though! The hotel soaps used are SUPER scented. It just permeates the room. Ground floor rooms like mine open up to open walkways. I kept my curtains C.L.O.S.E.D the whole time because um. Creepy. Bed and pillows, ridic squishy and comfy. The bathroom area CAN be closed off via curtain for privacy which was nice. Great water pressure, no issue with hot water. Doors tend to slam close rather than gently shut.. so those late night arrivals from other rooms were a minor annoyance. 

Staff: So accommodating! Barely wanted, but when I did they provided. Always someone at the front desk, always helpful. Contract process was a breeze (Shout out to Abigail B! thank you!). A slight mixup as they booked our room to be used after our meeting ended but we didn't know and went over. While we scrambled to get out they accommodated their other booking somewhere else. Some places would have tried to make us feel guilty - they rolled with it and made it work. 

Patio: extra awesome. Fire pit, comfy seats

Food: We didn't order from the restaurant but did cater the meeting. Surprise, I had an unknown vegetarian in the group... bigger surprise, the Hotel had the catered food prepped with a vegi option. I was able to shout out \"there is a vegi option if you'd like!\" and point to it and look like a hero -- thanks guys!  (and it all tasted good too!)

Bar: We may or may not have spent an exorbitant amount of money here. Quick service and good drinks. absolutely nothing to complain about!

Basically this place was so much fun for my business oriented group I have completely changed around my priorities when searching out hotels for our future events. More fun and less stuffy!"}
{"text":"I recently stayed at the Valley Ho for a conference being held on-site. My experience was really nice, everything from the food to the retro style room to the poolside atmosphere.  Cafe ZuZu has an assorted lunch selection and Trader Vic was only a short on-site walk where I enjoyed their happy hour. The front desk, catering and valet staff were helpful and provided outstanding service to all the guests.  When scheduling future company events I will definitely keep the Valley Ho in mind."}
{"text":"It was my first time in Scottsdale and they won my heart. Not only will I return back to this city, I will return back to this hotel.
Valley Ho has a modern contemporary feel to it. The second you get there you are welcomed with a friendly staff with a smile on their face. I had a pool view room. The room was so spacious and up to standards for cleanliness, the balcony was huge, and room service was speedy!
The only thing that might need a little more improvement on is the music by the pool. I did go in the beginning of March, so the better music might not have started till Spring/Summer starts. Wasn't horrible, but I would prefer something more. Besides that, everything else was wonderful! Can't wait to come back for spring training next year. Thank you for a great stay!"}
{"text":"My old man and I booked a staycation here, and it was OK, but there were some things that could have been improved.

The good:
-The room looked great! Sweet decor, nice bathroom, cool lighting, very clean.
-Room price was reasonable
-Walking distance to breakfast/cafes/fun stuff to do

The not so good:
-They nickel-and-dime you for everything. Some hotels at this price range will give you a couple of free bottles of water in your room, but this place puts in a couple that cost $4 if you drink them.
-The overnight parking fee is extortion. There's no other option. And who is going to stay here without a car? Phoenix/Scottsdale is not that kind of place. Plus you have to have a valet get it for you every single time you want to leave. There's no self-park option.
-The pool seems like it is designed to be a party destination for drunk frat boys. It is crowded with drunk people behaving obnoxiously all afternoon, plus there's a DJ blasting loud music all day. That's great if you're that type of person, but if you want to enjoy a nap in your room, or go for a relaxing swim, forget it. The pool was nice at night, though.
-We even had paramedics taking a very ill person out of a party in a room near ours one night - probably drank himself to near death. That's the sort of guest you can expect to encounter here.

I can't complain too much, because I suppose the hotel is not aimed at customers like us, but we chose to stay there anyway. Definitely going to choose something else next time."}
{"text":"Fabulous experience in the king tower suite!  The most \"me\" hotel ever- when can I move in?

Started with my girls by the pool around 1:30.  Was able to check in at this super early time- very grateful!

We were immediately wowed by the room- from the full kitchen, awesome decoration, wide patio, bathroom, shower you name it.

The pool service was great- a gal & gentleman bringing us waters and menus right as we get there.  Several groups of guys at the pool this Saturday and couples.  At the pool we has piña colada, lava flow, and fresh berry mojito.  The staff was friendly & treated me to a complimentary birthday drink!

We spent a few hours in the room- great view of the sunset. Several cool chairs and couches, scrabble, martini shaker, fur throw blanket and details to make it seem like your staying in a chicly vintage downtown loft.

The shower takes forever to get warm.  Really nice touch adding a loofah- and the sphere hand soap.  The bed was low slung and comfortable with fluffy pillows.  Automatic sunscreens provided a nice late sleep-in."}
{"text":"This swanky mini-oasis feels more like a private island retreat than a hotel in the desert. The well-apportioned retro rooms are both practical and indulgent. Our first floor room has a sliding door that opens onto a patio right in front of the pool and hot tub. There, you can relax with twenty of your best friends, have a BBQ, or drink at the open air bar. This is more like South Beach than the American West, and I love it. 

The whole place has a relaxed party vibe. (Someone initially told me it was a swinger hotel, and the in-room cocktail shaker/privacy curtains on the patio make me believe it, but nobody's actually hit on me, so...?) Staff are friendly; the cafe serves fresh, tasty food. The gym is also pretty nice--ear buds, towels, iced lemon water and fresh apples complement modern, clean machines. 

Hotel Valley Ho's location near downtown Scottsdale also doesn't hurt. But really, I could stay here all day and lounge by the pool and drink mai tais. There's not much reason to leave this place if you don't have to. Definitely one of my favorite hotels in the West."}
{"text":"I stayed at this hotel because I waited too long to book a hotel during Spring Training. I was in Scottsdale to visit a friend showing her art at the art Expo. The Hotel Valley Ho was a treat. The hotel was like being in Palm Springs with the color palette and the 1950s type architecture. The room was so beautiful with a balcony over looking a courtyard with a running fountain and a blue lit bathroom. The bathtub was so deep I had to take a bath with the bath salts they provided. The room was spacious and completely updated. Anything I asked for was delivered to my room in five minutes. 

I had a massage at the spa and while it wasn't the best massage I ever had, it was really relaxing and professional. 

My experience at the Hotel Valley Ho was wonderful and relaxing.  I recommend it."}
{"text":"Prob the worst experience ever... checked my car and carried my luggage - 3 bags in heels the length of the property never finding my room in the 5000 suite. Lug everything back to the check in to the giggles of the check in girl... 

Now sitting in the lounge ignored? I must have BO or is it just because I'm by myself. 

Worst experience ever!"}
{"text":"Skip the chain hotels and hit this place for a unique stay. Awesome refurb of a nifty motel with some really sweet rooms. Simple lobby, but fantastic service all around. You'll be hard-pressed to find something this neat-o anyplace given the history of this place. 

I had setup a corporate event here, using conference rooms and the pool area for drinks and dinner. Everything was great, with a truly retro feel on the food/drinks/cocktails.

P.S. This place may cost you, but surprise! You're in Scottsdale, fool!"}
{"text":"Buyer beware. 

I had stayed here before through a corporate booking, and had gotten a great room that opened on to a nice courtyard. Since that visit, I had been looking forward to staying here again, as Scottsdale is a hub for my corporation, and my team and I meet here about 4 times a year. 

This time, here for pleasure with friends, I spotted a deal on Hotels.com, which the ValleyHo gladly matched (upon verification) saving me about $20/night. And that's where the good news ends, and the trouble begins...

As soon as we checked in, the staff referenced the Hotels.com price and they gave us a room on the street (complete with traffic noise) in a building as far afield from the main building as they could find. The room was down a dark interior cooridor, and rougher around the edges than I had remembered, with a broken coffee maker, noisy air-conditioner, and faded decor. One might suspect that we landed in this far-flung room because the hotel was full, but alas, it was half empty and we still got shafted on the room. 

We stayed for breakfast (which was good) and a quick dip in the pool (crowded by 10a, but then again it is the desert) and then checked out. At the tail end of our stay, we traded in the ValleyHo for the Hilton, and were treated better for it. Sad to say goodbye to one of the 'hipper' hotels in Scottsdale, but I will unless they upgrade their service."}
{"text":"I stayed here when it was still being renovated.  It was a throwback to the 60's era.  My room was spacious and comfortable, they spared no expense. The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Needless to say the service was top notch."}
{"text":"Had a bunch of out of town visitors recently and we decided to live it up a little and got rooms at the Valley Ho.  I was so impressed with the rooms we had.  They put us all next to each other on the second floor by the pool.  The terraces were ENORMOUS.  The bed was so comfortable I never wanted to get out of it.  Very cool mid-century modern hip place.  Had drinks and appetizers in the bar and really enjoyed ourselves.  I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Spent the weekend with my daughter and we had a fantastic time. The amenities are great, service was great and all the staff are friendly and helpful. Our meals at Cafe Zuzu were fantastic!! The pool was fun and very comfortable. Our room was perfect. I love the mid-century feel. I definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Unless you like hanging out a Frat House, this place is not for you. There were fights in the hallway, drunk people yelling all night long, doors slamming starting at 10:00 pm until 3:00-4:00 am. We complained to the management only for them to shrug their shoulders as if to say, yes we hear this all of the time. The \"maid\" service does not even begin to clean your room until 5:00 pm, so we could not even get into our room to get ready for dinner.  Unless you are age 18-21, this is not the hotel for you. The Firesky Hotel, Sanctuary Resort even the Hilton hotel in Scottsdale are far better."}
{"text":"I stayed here for work and it was fab.  I arrived early in the day, and since the rest of my party was coming in on another flight that got delayed, I was kind of early and kind of bored.

Not only did the hotel allow me to check in early, but the desk staff was polite and friendly.  I like when people open doors for me.

My room was at the other end of the complex, and once I got to my room the keys didn't work.  After lugging my bags (purse + suitcase + laptop bag), this was not ideal.  They were apologetic and gave me another key, which was nice.

I had a few hours to kill, so naturally I got in bed with my laptop (not like that) and got some work done.  I was really impressed with how soft the beds were.  Usually nothing beats my stupidly expensive mattress at home, but this one rivaled my own.

The hotel has a very retro/modern appeal, and the rooms are beautiful.  I had a small deck with a lounge chair outside, and if it weren't so hot for my Minneapolis skin, it would have been lovely.  I lasted about 2 minutes out there.

Room service is a little pricey.  On business trips you have to pay for your lunch only, and a Caesar salad with diet Coke cost $20.  Blah.  Otherwise I was happy.  The room was neat and quiet, and, as I said, service was great too.

I don't think I'll end up in Scottsdale ever again (but never say never!), but I'd consider staying here on my own if that serendipitous event occurred."}
{"text":"I have stayed at Hotel Valley Ho for five years running every March.  It is the best destination in Scottsdale hands down.  From the excellent food and cocktails at the pool to the amazing burgers at Zuzu, you cannot go wrong here.  Excellent gym and spa to boot!  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Valley Ho Hotel love your mid century groove. Sweet room. Though a little pricey for summertime Phx, Az rates. Get over yourself..."}
{"text":"I LOVE this hotel. Have stayed twice in the past year for work, but have managed to eat quite a few meals there and a couple of quick dips in the pool, all of which was superb. Have also used the fitness center most days--excellent. The whole place is beautifully restored with the perfect mix of mid-century style and contemporary comfort, and spotlessly clean. Every person I interacted with was friendly and helpful. The rooms are beautiful, peaceful and spacious."}
{"text":"As a valley resident, I've never stayed at the Valley Ho (but definitely would do a stay-cation if I ever got time off!), but I've been to several of their events, hung out at the pool and even met with the wedding planner, who is wonderful. 

Going to the Valley Ho makes me feel like I've been transported to Hollywood in the 1960s. It is delightfully vintage in a clean, colorful and coordinated way without losing even a hint of modern luxury. 

Last Saturday, the pool was the perfect place to spend a scorching day, lounging on the bright yellow towels on lounge chairs while servers delivered ice cold water with lemon without you ever even requesting it. Coors Light girls would give out free samples as well as Svedka girls giving samples of delicious smoothies. The DJ was playing great music and everyone was having fun; but I never got that grossed out feeling I sometimes get at pools where people are drinking. 

I love everything about Hotel Valley Ho, but the one other thing I *have* to mention is the outdoor events venue on top of the main hotel building. The view is absolutely breathtaking (especially of Camelback), and it is set up very nice. I hope I get invited to an event that's held there one day!!"}
{"text":"DON'T get a Cabana at the pool here. Not worth the $300 (doesn't include bottle service) and any drinks you buy is extra. Which I was okay with actually. However,  the door guy is a complete Nazi!  My friend had to get a room to get into the pool area (another 100 bucks) Older people, a few ladies for hire, \"interesting\" crowd to say the least. I'll take my future  business to El Santo or Maia."}
{"text":"Love this place. Second time here so we booked a room in the tower. First time we had a beautiful room that had a patio but was near the pool so we had to deal with quite a bit of noise. This time it was incredibly quiet. The rooms are decorated in a hip and quirky way, but are comfortable and appointed well. 
Besides the proximity to everything and the great pool area the staff service is unparalleled. Every step of the way the staff was friendly, helpful and efficient."}
{"text":"Apparently it's been thoroughly renovated as a 1956-built hotel where the Hollywood elite hung out.  I can see this.  It's retro Mad Men heaven!  Very tastefully appointed form the lobby, lounge to the rooms.  Great mid century mod design and furnishings.  The rooms are all like suites.  Large, comfortable, well decorated, convenient and with every amenity you could need.  Great space, awesome bathrooms and just a great environment.  I wish my stay hadn't been for business and thus, so short.  I'd definitely come back just to hang out there!

Also, the food at their restaurant ZuZu was great as well!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  The pool is a lot smaller than what the pictures show.  The nice thing is that they give you complimentary water as you sit on your chair.  The grounds are constantly in use by weddings or events.  All the workers there are pretty good looking, just not so outgoing or friendly.  The room is nice, we paid extra for a patio only to find a boring lounge chair and table outside.  

The front desk is very unhelpful.  If you ask to get your bill early or put a note on your room, they just tell you to ask again later."}
{"text":"This is the most beautiful hotel property I've ever satayed at. Ever.

I recently booked a huge room for one of my best friends bachelor party. It was 2 stories, had 2 balconies, 2 bathrooms and one nice big bed. Word of warning, even though the room is huge, it is not designed to sleep more than 2. Why someone would need so much space is beyond me, it was as big as my house I rent out in Gilbert. That didn't matter for our one night stay since we were there to party!  

There were a few things that stood out to me about the Hotel Valley Ho that I wanted to point out in my review. The décor. The pool. The service. 

The décor:
This place makes retro so sexy. It was pretty awesome to see a retro styled fridge but the fridge being high end and modern behind it's façade. Every bit of detail was planned out in this hotel to transport you to an era of a simpler time, but with class. Glasses, curtains, lobby, pool bar, hallways, all well thought out but not so out there that it takes away from your stay.

The pool:
If Vegas is too far, the Valley Ho can feed your pool fix. Tons of lounge chairs encircle the pool. Valley Ho pool staff do a great job making sure your drink is never empty. The bar area is also a great place to hang out. You can catch a game on the TV's or sit at a table under some misters. They also blast top 40 music throughout the pool area to give it that party feel. 

The service:
You pay for what you get. I thoroughly enjoyed being called Mr this and Mr that.  Even though we were loud all night and were partying on the balcony causing security to come up 3 times, I never felt like they were considering thought less of us as a guest because we were the loud group of the night. Plus they really took care of me with an early check in and giving me a call when the room was ready and giving me a pool key to lounge at the pool early on.

Overall I had such a great experience I think I will rent another room to do another party this summer with friends. Thanks Valley Ho!"}
{"text":"This hotel was built in the 50's I believe. They spent $80 million on renovations in 2005, and keeping with the roots of the building, went with beautiful mid-century furniture and decor.  Lovely.

The pool is centrally located within the 6-wing complex and cabanas are nice.  We didn't stay to enjoy their famous pool parties but I'm sure it's a good time.  

ZuZu's is pretty cool for a late night hang out, though they are also open for breakfast.  Food and cocktails pretty much served all day.

My room was in wing 6 facing 68th Street. The room itself was nice but it was noisy with all the traffic and neighbors failing to turn off their alarms.  If you have heavy luggage don't stay on the 2nd floor - I didn't see an elevator...unless I just completely missed it.

Location of the hotel is great, right at the end if Main and a short walk from great shopping, restaurants and bars.

Customer service was meh.

Overall I would probably stay here again although a vendor originally booked this hotel for us.  Pretty cool spot."}
{"text":"I liked this hotel overall. There was a little room for improvement. 
The pros:  
great pool with good vibe, good eye candy and good drinks. So if your single, ready to mingle and enjoy laying out, check this place out.
The spa was also above average, I had a fairly decent massage. The room is nice, and trader vics was superb!

The cons. This place is as old as Hugh heffners balls, yes yes yes, it's well maintained but its from the 70's and looks like an ugly old motel from outside,
Also, some of the staff was complaining about how bad management was, I found this unprofessional and it just doesn't look good when staff isn't happy. 
My tip is to check out the website, I bought some package deal for 2 nights, 2 drinks upon arrival, a nice dinner at trader vics,  free breakfast both days and 2 massages at the spa.
I forget the exact cost, but it saves lots of money."}
{"text":"Such a special place...
A wonderful contemporary hotel that maintains the continuity of its mid century modern esthetics. 
Great historical story that is palpable in every nook and cranny of the architecture. 
The grounds are meticulously manicured.  
The decor and finishes Dwell worthy. 
Amenities that challenge any chain hotel; most of which are complimentary. 
And a staff that mirrors the above!
Hotel Valley Ho is hands down one of my favorite hotels!! 
Annnnnnnd it's dog friendly."}
{"text":"This hotel gets it right.  It is clean, well-appointed, and the staff is amazing.  Loved the modernized retro theme.  My room was perfect.  The bed was comfy.  My pet peeve about hotels is the lack of attention to shower cleanliness.  There was no scum or mold in my shower.  :)  The restaurant staff is kind, and the food is super yummy.  I would stay here if I were to visit Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"Pretty funky hotel! Very happy to stay here for work as I was able to enjoy the big, cozy and chic room, plus the various amenities onsite during my off time.

There's a great spa, a cute bar/restaurant and not just one, but two fantastic swimming pools!

There were minor noise issues in my room in the very middle of the night, but the folks at the front desk were extremely polite when I called in at 3am to let them know that there was considerable noise coming from the room above me. Even with earplugs I wear for travel I could hear what sounded like furniture being dragged across the floor. Though one has to expect some level of noise in hotels when traveling, I appreciated that my call was taken seriously and that they hopped into action to investigate asap.

Everything from the linens to the soaps and the huge soaker tub made my stay absolutely awesome. The grounds were kept neat, the hallways were clean, and my room was spotless.

Huge bonus points for: A full length mirror, a bathrobe, a blowdryer, and free WIFI. When traveling these are things I look for first in a hotel and Valley Ho came through and knocked it out of the park. Of all of the hotels I've stayed in on various trips to PHX, this is hands down the one I'll recommend to friends and keep at the top of my list."}
{"text":"Great place.

I've stayed here a few times and each time it was great. The lobby is impressive, the bar flows nicely into the diner/eating area. The rooms are large with great decoration, definitely trends on the modern side. They have created a vibe that is unique to this hotel and is carried out through the entire experience. 

The location is great, you can ride the trolley for free to most of the Scottsdale entertainment. Of course you can drive/taxi too."}
{"text":"Great hotel with cool retro vibe but all of the modern amenities you'd expect from a $400/night hotel. The room (503) was nice although not over the top. Some very cool artwork and lighting features including artwork on the ceiling. The bathroom was nice with excellent bathroom supplies. Breakfast was top notch at ZuZu- I highly recommend the vegetable and goat cheese omelet.  Staff was both pleasant and helpful throughout and location near arts district Old Town was perfect for dining drinking and entertainment options. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"We have stayed at Hotel Valley Ho 2 times now--last time was a luxury stay, this time was a budget stay. Both times were great and definitely worth the value of the cost of the hotel and the amenities on the property!

I will say that the summer pool area has become a bit of a nightclub scene, so if you are into that you will really enjoy staying here on the weekends. If you are not into that, request a room as far away from the pool as possible (because the music is bumping and you can definitely hear that bass from your hotel room if you are near the main pool next to the lobby). 

The staff at Hotel Valley Ho is wonderful, and the property is well-maintained. The first time we stayed it was in a suite close to the top floor and we had a kitchen and living room. This time around, we stayed in the \"motel\" style section and had a spacious king bed with an open-air tub. Both rooms were beautifully decorated and clean, and definitely worth the price you pay for each of them! 

What you can expect from the billing--if you are using a debit card, they take all the funds like most hotels do when you put your card down for incidentals. But expect that they will put all of the funds back onto your card the next day, and will take multiple days to resolve the correct charges. Not something that bothered me this time around, but just wanted to throw that out there in case anyone was thinking of staying here with a debit card (just to keep in mind and know that ahead of time so you can manage your funds according)."}
{"text":"Wonderfully beautiful hotel.   50s Hawaiian feel done with modern touches in Arizona.   We booked our trip last minute (the morning of) and had absolutely no issues .   Our room was clean , large , and funky in a good way.  The view from our room was of the street but we can't complain.   The pool and service at the pool is extraordinary!   The two bartenders were very attentive , friendly , offered up ideas of where we could go to eat and drink in the area, and most importantly kept not only our drinks full but our waters as well.

We would recommend this hotel to anyone.   

Love it"}
{"text":"nice property. i stayed in a signature king in building 5 --great decor, comfortable bed. the one truly objectionable thing about this place is the bubble-gum scented cleaning product used seemingly everywhere in the hotel. inescapable, it must be vacuumed into the carpets. seriously? headache & sore throat inducing & it smells like BUBBLE GUM. spare your cleaning staff & your guests & use something green."}
{"text":"First thing I should say is I am pretty hard to impress when it comes to hotels. Being from Las Vegas, we have some of the best hotels and the most reasonable prices in the country. So I am often let down when staying traveling with small rooms, outdated setup, or just not exactly the view or whatever they claimed when booking the room. So for me to say this was impressive, is saying a lot.

I booked a two-night stay in a Tower Suite. The room was fantastic and was better than advertised. The room made you feel like you were in a resort in Hawaii or some tropical paradise (better than my room in Hawaii as a matter of fact). It was a great setup with a full kitchen and layout meant to host some outdoor sun bathing and enjoying of the weather on the decent sized patio. It overlooks the pool and was all in all the nicest room I have stayed in outside of Las Vegas ever. So that is saying something. Staff was very nice and the valets were spot on and quick. Desk staff was very nice and got me checked in quickly with little fuss. Plenty of places to eat in the area, and you can always grab one of the taxi golf carts to drive you anywhere in the area. That was a nice added bonus to doing a little bar hopping and not having to trek too far on foot.
I will be back and this will be my place to stay when I am in the PHX area."}
{"text":"Anything I write will not do justice to this awesome, awesome hotel. I've stayed here a good dozen or so times over the past three years and it's always fantastic. I love all the rooms. If you can get a suite, you're an extra lucky duck, but even the basic rooms are adorable with phenomenal bathrooms.

The bar and restaurant is also great, with fantastic appetizers, wonderful specialty cocktails, and fun rat pack music. Breakfast is better than most restaurants, forget about comparing it to standard hotel fare.

The location is also good, with plenty of shopping, restaurants and bars within easy walking distance.

This place is not within my normal price range at all, but it is worth every penny and I would never stay anywhere else in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I stayed here for a work trip. I was pleasantly surprised!  This place has an updated modern motif with a 60's flair. The service was great from the time I checked in until I departed."}
{"text":"The pool service/bar staff was unparalleled in their easy going hospitality- local or visitor should come stop by the Valley Ho and have a drink by the pool.  Special mention to bartenders Josh and Roger and towel boy Michael- thanks for the excellent experience!"}
{"text":"(This review is not of the actual Hotel, but the New years Eve event they hosted)

An encomium to Valley Ho. 

OK, so it was New Years Eve and I found myself at the Hotel Valley Ho, and I thought it was amazing. People was super nicely dressed (statistically, there's always a few douchy outliers) and looking hot. This was the little older Scottsdale crowd that is OK with a $100 ticket to get in (includes open bar) and they act the part. People were very friendly, and stayed classy (yet again this is an average) throughout the night until the wee hours - when the elegance of the behaved has announced their retreat, and leave room for the belligerent fools as it should be.

Ambiance.
Very classy event Valley Ho - very classy indeed. Makes me want to come for the other events like Halloween and.. I don't know, but this will stay on my mind for a while. But what made my whole evening was the ambiance, that cut through the forced swanky wannabe-wealthy, and really gave room for an experience that felt exclusive, chic and smart. 

Eats&Drinks.
Did I mention open bar? With that said one would expect lines, but there was no long wait for anything. I really enjoyed it. There was food too, but I didn't partake in that at all. Ohyeah, another thing of the open bar.. decent liquor choices as well such as Ketel1 and Bombay Sapphire. One cannot complain here. Not one bit. 

Improvements.(?) 
Well, the photographers they had could have covered the backdrop for an hour or two, that would been really cool. But I guess asking the people lounging around to take pictures of yourself works too.. just not as well.

In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed the whole shenanigan.. and I will frequent your hotel again.
Stay classy Valley Ho."}
{"text":"Friendly staff.
Noise isolation in rooms can use some improvement. 
The facility can nicely accommodate large groups. 
Rooms are clean. And restaurant serves good food."}
{"text":"Hotel Valley Ho has been one of my favorite places to visit in Scottsdale. We have been coming here for 10 years and love it every time. Last weekend I hosted a spa day and dinner at \"Zuzu's\".  Everything was so perfect. We had the amazing popovers as an appetizer, enjoyed  the best scallops ever, short ribs(just like mom's), squash ravioli. The special moment was when Chef Tony Huerta came to our table to see how everything tasted. He was so down to earth and friendly. Knowing how important this evening was for me, he sent out the most perfect two desserts I have ever tasted. My guests said he could definitely be on \"TOP CHEF\". There were figs and cheese and lots of splendid flavors. I guess our palates were elevated. The entire wait staff made it a great celebration that we can remember always."}
{"text":"A comfortable, kitschy spot to lay your head!

I really enjoyed my stay at Valley Ho. Despite the amusing name, it's a fun, vintage styled spot to stay. Checking in was a breeze, and we were directed to our room - the layout of the hotel is pretty bizarre, we had to walk quite a windy path to get to our building.

Our room had two double beds which felt quite small - next time I'll opt for the king room! But the room was clean and comfortable, with mood lighting over the bath which would have been perfect had I had time for one!

The shower had good pressure, and the bath products smelled good. The cleaners did a good job each day, which was great as I had long work days and it was lovely to come back to a clean and neat room (I won't say tidy as I don't think I have that gene!)

The rooms were very nicely renovated and I had the chance to see one of the king rooms which have a bathtub in the middle - SO awesome! Like I said, next time I'm getting that room for sure!

My only complaint was the tv channels - no food network?? There was very little to watch - neither my boyfriend nor I found a channel we were happy with.

Overall I had a great experience at Valley Ho and I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Had a great stay recently. The staff couldn't have been friendlier, from the moment I drove up until I drove away. Enjoyed the pool too, which is huge. However, the main attraction for me is the '50s ambience. I even heard Elvis tunes permeating the lobby while I was checking in. A few months ago, I came across a 1960s-era photo of the place. I went to Google Street View to see what it looks like now, expecting to see some EconoLodge-Ramada-Travelodge eyesore. I was surprised to see how original it looks, only freshened up a bit, clean, and vibrant. I'll be back."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.

Awesomely swanky, but the maid service folks need to relax.

Loved my stay here. Stylish rooms (though mine overlooked construction), good food/drinks, friendly staff, great location... 

BUT, I was annoyed enough to comment on the incessant door knocking on the morning of my check out. I asked for late check out and put the \"do not disturb\" sign up. Still, I had to fend off knock-knocking hotel staff no less than 8 times between 8:30am -12:30. Even had a maid enter while I was undressed and scurry away after I yelled \"Don't come in!\"

So, to the fine folks of The Valley Ho: don't bother providing \"Do not disturb/Clean room\" signs if they are just going to be ignored. The place is too cool for that to leave a bad taste in my traveling mouth.

Otherwise, stay here."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff, fun, clean rooms, nice workout room. Terrific food at ZUZU. Very cool."}
{"text":"We recently stayed at Hotel Valley Ho for my sister's bachelorette party. The hotel is adorable! The hotel rooms are pretty spacious and are well decorated. The hotel offers a couple of different dining options - pool side, room service, and Zuzu's. They also have a couple of different pool options: one noisier option with live music and one quieter, more relaxing option. Drink and food service at the pool is pretty good - our waitress frequently checked in and made sure our water glasses were always full. We were able to try out the pool side food service as well as the room service when we had a Spa Day. The food is pretty good and the service is excellent. The spa was amazing - we were a group of five girls and among the five of us, we tried: massages, facials, wraps, and reflexology. We also took advantage of the gym - the gym offers a bunch of cardio machines - treadmills, ellipticals, and bikes, and a variety of weight lifting machines as well. The hotel is also conveniently located in downtown Scottsdale with several restaurants, stores, and sights located within walking distance. It was the perfect place to stay for a Bachelorette."}
{"text":"In 1985, Dr. Emmett Brown invented time travel, and then in 2005, MSR Properties, with a little inspiration from Dr. Brown's time traveling ways, invented a Time Machine in the form of Hotel Valley Ho.

\"1.21 gigawatts!\"

So, if you're going to build a time machine with style, why not build it into a hotel? It's a genius idea. And if you still don't believe me when I say that this hotel is a time machine, just take one step inside in lobby. You'll immediately feel the clock reversing back to the 50s. It's a valley vintage twist on Back to the Future. A clever combination of 50s style with a new age flair. 

The 50s decade is my favorite. I totally want to go back and live during that time. But I'd also like to throw in some updated elements, and Hotel Valley Ho does it all. What an excellent time machine!

When I'm at the Valley Ho, my concept of time goes out the window. That's how relaxed I am. The rooms are exceptionally comfortable and spacious. Things are simple yet exciting. Time moves slower here.

Matt and I always reserve a basic room - with soft teal, grass green, vibrant orange and snazzy reddish 50s decor and a heavenly cozy yet exceptionally large king bed covered in fun accent pillows. The bathroom contains a large shower and tons of counter space, as two people can get ready together side by side. Plenty of mirrors, spotless clean amenities and it's spacious, too! I've even enjoyed sitting out on the room's balcony while downing a bottle or two of champagne, especially when it's nice outside. For the price, it's a steal. Plus, make sure to check their Web site as there's always a special going on. 

You can even find an updated Scottsdale version of the 1950s pin up girls here, just visit the pool scene and you'll see what I mean. The pool is hopping, well, during the spring/summer months at least. On the weekends they have a DJ, so it gets a little rowdy. They post the OH Pool Bar & Cabana rental info on their Web site too. 

We've also rented a cabana twice, and it's 100% worth it. I stand firm in my belief that it's the best cabana deal around. The drink specials at the pool are fantastic, and the service is superior. With every cabana rental you get your choice of 3 free awesome amenities, like a fruit, veggie or hummus platter, deck of playing cards, Fiji waters... it's a nice bonus. With the refreshing misters, the luxurious lounge chairs, shaded sanctuary and prime pool access, the cabanas are a must do. 

In the future, all hotels will have 5-star worthy customer service... that is if Valley Ho's staff is any indication. In today's world, most hotels have really lost that personalized touch, and they make you feel like one of many. Not Hotel Valley Ho, I always feel important here. From the front desk, to the bartenders, to the room service, it's all top notch. I've been here on multiple staycations have never had a bad experience. 

I imagine that the two Hollywood darlings of the fifties, Audrey and Marilyn, would love a place like the Valley Ho. Especially since it encompasses the style and swank of a glamorous 50s hot spot. This hotel romanticizes the 50s by striking a balance between a sophisticated yet youthful atmosphere. Celebrities of the past and present have graced this hotel with their presence, and I expect this trend to continue into the future. It's a special place, and unlike any other hotel I've been to.

Anyone considering a trip to the Valley of the Sun must check out this hotel. If not only for the sole fact that it also doubles as a time machine! \"1.21 gigawatts!\""}
{"text":"Ladies and Gentle PLEASE don't waste your time here..ROTTEN service and pretentious staff at the lobby bar.   I don't mind paying higher prices for good service and atmosphere, I refuse to do that with a bartender and staff that refuse to acknowledge and service the customer in a courteous manner.

I waited 15 minutes to be acknowledged by the bartender then he just looked at us and went down to the end of the bar and started cleaning glasses.  Valley HOLE is off my lists of places to go and take guests and coworkers!"}
{"text":"I love this hotel.  I had been admiring from afar and had it on my \"want to stay there\" list.  It exceeded all of my expectations.  (Except Saturdays).  Most reviews told of the \"Don Draper\" décor and feel.  So true!  I, too, was hoping to see him sitting at the bar or by the pool. The rooms were spacious and clean and definitely had the hotel theme going.  I highly suggest, if you get opportunity as we did, to watch the sunset from the rooftop. Amazing!  

Now, Saturdays.......

If you have young children you probably do not want to stay on a Saturday.  The pool is open to registered hotel guests only and there is a huge party!  The party is great but turns into a sexfest as the day progesses.  It then leads to late night hotel room parties (that kept us up).  It would be super fun if that is your thing but it gets quite spicy. Drinking, sun and couples fun!  ;)

Sundays, needless to say are quiet.............

The staff was super helpful and accommodating, the valet guys were great - always sending you off with a cold bottle of water and calling you by name.  

This hotel was everything I hoped it would be and more and I will definitely return!  

Love the Ho!"}
{"text":"Had a great staycation here a few weeks ago. Really love the rooms and the quality of the features inside. The original room we were put in was pool side but had a view of a road so for $30 more we upgraded to a view of the main pool and it was well worth it. Great vibe and a very relaxed feel. Very solid construction and no noise from rooms beside us. The pool must have been salt water because there was no nasty chlorine smell, it was lovely.

My only complaint was that I asked the parking attendant about the parking situation, if  I could self park and if there was free parking and he said I could self park but the parking was $18 a a night. As I was checking out I heard a guy checking people in tell them they could park on the street just outside the property for free. I would have appreciated knowing that from the valet attendant. He seemed a bit rude when I explained I wanted to self park my car. 

Other than that, what a great hotel and property. I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Let me give you the low-down on this jazzy place. First: the folks who work there are totally non-judgmental. Doesn't matter how you dress or what you look like; they treat everyone who comes with respect and a positive attitude. That goes a long way with a working person like myself who doesn't try too hard to impress and often gets judged for not 'dressing the part' of success. When I travel it is often with juicers, boxes of veggies, a multitude of dogs or even collectibles. I really appreciate their fair treatment of each of us who stayed at this great location. Really super management model.
The place was beautiful to be in and at, clean and uplifting. The colors, textures, even the sunlight coming through the sheers and room dividers brought a smile to our faces. The grounds are well maintained, the people who work at the front desk, restaurants and even the maids are all polite and caring to each who need them. I couldn't ask for a nicer stay and will be sure to return only next time with a bunch of friends in tow to enjoy the suites. 
Thanks so much for taking care of us! You ROCK Valley Ho!"}
{"text":"I have to say even with its few minor faults - 
I absolutely LOVE this hotel!!!! 

My boyfriend and I stayed in a lovely big suite for my birthday last August (we even brought our dogs!!) 
- the room was AMAZING !!!! 
So fun!!! 

Down side being:
The food isn't exceptional (they don't really cater to my food allergies) and over all the bar staff /drinks are just 'meh' 'ok' !! 

The location is great (close to old town etc)

The decor/ style/ ambiance of the hotel is my favorite!! ...

I kind of feel like I am in an episode of 'Mad Men' lol !!! 

Recommend !!!"}
{"text":"When I think of historic Scottsdale I think of the Hotel Valley Ho. This is a classic that has been updated to fit into the modern world. For those not from here, this hotel reminds me of the The Standard in Downtown LA.. Whether you come here for a stay during Spring Training, for drinks in the lobby bar or on the roof, or even for poolside yoga, this is a great place to visit. Great service and a cool vibe in a classic art-deco style building. Plus, its close enough to the bar district that if necessary, you could stumble back.

All in all, the Valley Ho is a gem in the City of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I come here every year for our anniversary. The rooms are extremely unique and clean. We love the Saturday pool party. Rates can be expensive but it's worth it for our one night stay we do every year."}
{"text":"I have been to this hotel many times. Sometimes just for a facial or massage at their spa, sometimes just for brunch, and sometimes for a staycation. The customer service is always amazing. If you haven't had brunch at ZuZu, do it! I love the pool during the summer. It's not as crazy as the other old town spots (which i like), but the music is till good and drinks are delish! The spa has weekday specials of 50% off too!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS OASIS! It is like a paradise in the desert!
As a native to the valley, I've often heard of the Valley Ho, but never stayed there. I joined a modern architecture group that holds events here annually and decided to stay after this year's event. 
The staff is amazing, kind and welcoming, but also very quiet! The valet service was so great and friendly. 
And the hotel itself is worth just experiencing. The minute you drive under the signature neon sign you are greeted with a friendly wave by the valet and instantly transported to another world. 
Once you walk into the lobby you can see the guests lounging and hanging out, it's never empty, but never overwhelming. You feel like you're going to run into a friend and have the time of your life.
As you're guided to your room by the bell boy, he gives you a brief history of the hotel, explaining the modern architecture and the spirit of the Valley Ho. 
This hotel honors an era long past and keeps that spirit alive and well. 
We highly recommend this experience! And cannot wait until our next stay!"}
{"text":"Awesome hotel with great amenities a really cool pool area and mostly attentive staff. I love the Frank Loyd Wright decor with the added modern amenities. The pool was quiet and very enjoyable on my stay - Wed/Thu. We had an attentive pool server on Wednesday (5/24). A young lady that not only made sure we were well accommodated with whatever we wished, but also directed us to an amazing restaurant nearby - the House Brasserie. On Thursday (5/25) we had a different pool server who was very friendly, but seemed a little overwhelmed. We had a massage at the spa and found that to be very nice. I do wish the spa area had a hot tub and steam room. It did have a sauna...but it's Scottsdale. I could just step outside for hot and dry air. The staff at the spa were great! We did have breakfast at ZuZu, the restaurant and found that to be pretty good. The Belgian waffle with housemade cherry butter was delicious!

Overall...I had a great stay at Hotel Valley Ho and would definitely recommend it and come back. I can imagine, weekends and holidays here get pretty wild poolside. But...on my stay at least...it was quite peaceful."}
{"text":"Love this hotel! Very retro vibe ! The rooms are a great size, we stayed in the executive suite for a weekend for our anniversary and it's like a 1 bedroom 1 and half bath condo.. our kids were able to come for a night and comfortably all sleep. 
The bathtub-was amazing, could easily fit 4! Our patio was 1200sf and had awesome furniture to lounge on! 

ZuZu restaurant never disappoints, although they did take my fav meal off the menu lol 
Atmosphere, awesome.. spa, awesome, staff for the most part always awesome except the gentleman that checked us in that Friday, not much of a personality and I have a huge personality, and also own a business where customer service is important so maybe that makes me notice when people aren't that friendly, but I have to say the girl I first had for room service, was simply amazing! I can't remember her name now, kicking myself but she had glasses if that helps. An absolute gem with the best customer service skills! She helped me with a few things I could have called the front desk about!! We chatted, I'm very friendly lol, and omg she is just a doll! 
They are a pet friendly hotel so I had my maltipoos with us and the hotel is very accommodating for dogs, the grounds are beautiful, as are the pools. We literally live across the street in the Arcadia neighborhood but it's nice to have somewhere to staycation at close to home, I always forget things! 
The bellman Blake was so helpful and very nice as well and it was a good weekend all around. We stay here often so that also says something"}
{"text":"Awesome architecture.
Good location:  walk to old town Scottsdale.
Food at ZuZu was quite good.

But...
Parking valet staff was pushy, rude, and outright lied about the availability of self parking -- makes a really bad first impression.
Found trash on the floor in the room.  Otherwise, room looked clean, but makes me wonder how clean it really was."}
{"text":"What a great property. Only had been to the bar years ago after the renovation, finally had a chance to stay in a Studio room this weekend. I was over the moon after this stay.

I was looking for a nice weekend treat for me an my girlfriend. Vegas was tempting, but the drive eats up time I just don't have, and I don't gamble. For about the same as a discounted room at the Mirage and fuel expenses, I was able to get a gorgeous suite at the Valley Ho. 

Very fast, friendly check in. No lines, no bullshit resort fees and a personable guy behind the counter. Never get that in Vegas...

Decor is startlingly unique. In a sea of cookie cutter mega resorts, a nice spin on hip, 1960's American style is a welcome change of pace. The details are like no other hotel I've stayed in, and the grounds are well landscaped and immaculate. It's quite humbling to think this place has seen patrons for 55 years. 

Studio Suite is super cool. Clean, good sized and hip. Tub in the center of the room was very, very cool, and was very useful. Good bed, good linens, great shower. Dug the little patio and the large sliding glass doors were awesome on a cool fall morning. Good colors, too. Only a few gripes; the bed side lamps are unusable with their super bright, nasty color temperature CFLs. Thankfully, there's lots of other mood lighting available. Also, the ceiling was starting to look a bit worse for wear, with some sagging at the joints and some water stains. Flat roofs always leak, though. In room music system ala Hard Rock would be a great addition, since TV is for the birds.  

Location is unbeatable. A short walk to anything in Old Town, Fashion Square, nightclub block, etc. But far enough away from the bars that it's quiet at night. Found a great new restaurant (The House) on Main St. that I would have never stumbled across otherwise. Probably the only worthwhile, walkable district in Phoenix that never disappoints, and this hotel takes advantage of it. 

I will absolutely be back. Makes a great in town escape. Just wish I would have tried it out sooner!"}
{"text":"Valley Ho was 100% out of my comfort zone, but a welcome change. It was a little too \"MTV Spring Break\" on Saturday at the main pool, but Sunday was a perfect mix of people watching and pool lays. 

The rooms were clean and spacious, the decor was fun. I loved hearing about the history of the hotel from some of the pool guests. 

We rented a cabana on Sunday and Sasha, our host, killed it! She was great in all ways. I honestly feel like our experience wouldn't have felt complete without her. She was so so so so kind and made us feel taken care of. Also, I'd just love to have her as a friend, you've got a winner on staff. 

Tip for guests: there's tons of free parking around HVH! You don't have to pay the $18/night for valet. I was pleasantly surprised by this & saved a ton of cash. Valet was great during the horrific storm though :)"}

really cool but, durning my check out there was one guy at the front desk that was an individual that needs a bit of customer development training.

I did have room service and again no complaints (Cheese burger & twice fried fries).

Very clean hotel!!"}
{"text":"Show up after a long flight and their front desk computer system crashed the rude woman behind the counter told me 10 minutes to an hour.  No I'm so sorry sir, how about a coupon to go have a cocktail. Just go to hell go away great customer service. 

Place has a 1950,/60,s vibe in place of luxury and efficiency would never come here again"}
{"text":"Was very excited to stay at this mid century modern hotel. Boy was I sadly mistaken really quickly. Upon getting in the room there was a soaking wet pillow case on the bed, that was from the prior guest. I was looking forward in relaxing by the small pool to find out someone had booked a 1 year olds birthday party. Lets just say for it being a resort and a place to go to relax, this is not the place. The pool was so loud from screaming kids and jumping and splashing. Figure some alcohol by the pool would help, but after asking two staff members for help, and then told we had to use a phone to order by the pool was a little displeasing since they market themselves as an upscale resort. Lets just say this place is the worst and would not stay here again."}
{"text":"The Valley Ho is an experience.  A friend and I stayed here a few weeks ago, and I could not have been happier with our stay.  Our room was clean, had a feel that was a mixture between vintage and modern, and I loved the balcony that was attached to the room.  Our room was facing the pool, which made it convenient for the pool party on Saturday, as well.  

The pool party added an extra dimension of fun to the hotel.  There was music, drinking, and mingling by the pool, and my friends and I were able to hang out and have a good time.  They have buckets of beer for $16, but all the rest of the pool drinks seemed pricey.  And while two guests are free for each room, every other guest is $25 dollars.  Depending how much you want to drink, the prices can definitely add up.  

I would stay here again, but only if I'm able to spend a day hanging out by the pool/enjoying the hotel.  There are cheaper options in the area if you're only planning on sleeping at a hotel."}
{"text":"i received a call back from Shaun the director of guest operations,who was very professional
and concerned about my stay. He explained the upcoming renovations to the tower suites,that will certainly take care of the issues I spoke about.It was a pleasure to have someone so courteous and really cared about our stay at the Valley Ho.So we will definitely
returning .Thanks"}
{"text":"Best place Ive ever stayed in Scottsdale as far as fun, location, service, cleanliness, value...try it and you wont stay anywhere else!"}
{"text":"We stayed here for Labor Day weekend. Overall it was great experience. The architecture and the room layout was very nice, it felt like Don Draper from Mad Men was staying in the next door :) The grounds of Valley Ho are  green and nicely landscaped.  My favorite part was the fact that it's a pet friendly hotel (they even give you a food bowl and doggie bags- nice touch) so we could bring our pup with us which was awesome. We also enjoyed 2 pools and the restaurant which had great breakfast and drinks. It is located in a walking distance from all the shops and galleries and within a short drive from the mall, so it hits a variety of point. The staff was friendly as well. I would come back here and recommend it. The only thing I would've changed is make the in room water bottles free, everything else was good."}
{"text":"First hotel that I had an unpleasant stay at. My \"upgraded\" and expensive room overlooking the pool was noisy and had noisy neighbors. Poor soundproofing. After I was moved, the next room had a smell and some of the utilities were busted. For the price I was paying, it seemed ridiculous.

It was clean, the ZuZu restaurant was good, there was Hotel Valley Ho style, and all staff was friendly, but I wouldn't recommend staying there more than a couple nights at most. Same goes for Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This hotel is a gem! I was excited to stay here because of the esthetic. It is so adorable on line and even better in person. If I could give it a 10 Star I would! 
FIRST.. the people who work here are so friendly and went above and beyond every step of the way.
SECOND.. it's immaculate. So clean. Beautiful grounds. The lobby was gorgeous. The room was huge and comfortable. 
It is close enough to shopping and restaurants. We stayed on Easter weekend. Woke up to colorful plastic eggs all over the property! So cool! Loved this so much."}
{"text":"I just had my second Spa appointment and I must say, it gets better and better each time! The staff is so friendly, the waiting room always so clean and the service is extraordinary! Everyone should partake in what the Spa has to offer!"}
{"text":"Great hotel.  Except I was told that the San Francisco Giants stay there during Spring Training.  Other than that it was good."}
{"text":"We have stayed here many weekends to get away from the kids and whenever we have company in town we recommend the Valley Ho.  The rooms are beautifully decorated and clean.  The pools is a fun party place, not really a family pool but a tiny pool with refreshing cocktails, a DJ and private cabanas.  We've had our rooms run from $99 to $300 dollars depending on the season and what you are looking for.  If you're a couple or a single person wanting a fun time near old town,  this is your place !"}
{"text":"\"Hey Giambi, I've got money on you this year!\"

What kind of place kicks out 10 grown men from dinner that they've already ordered for being too obnoxious?  I mean we're hotel guests for Christ's sake.  Isn't it normal for a group of people to each have well over 10 drinks before the sun sets and then want to go have a classy dinner at a nice hotel?  Well apparently it's not ok to be piss drunk, cat call at women and stand up and yell stuff at the Oakland A's as they exited their team dinner, at least not at the Valley Ho.

In all seriousness we're lucky they didn't kick us out of the entire hotel.  I'll give Valley Ho 2 stars for that and nothing more.  Majorly overpriced for Scottsdale, the rooms seem futuristic in a cheap way and nothing stood out to me as cool.  The pool area is nice but what pool isn't nice in mid-March when you're coming from 50 degree weather?  It's obvious this place used to be a Best Western or some other cheap chain, you can dress a place up but the layout screams 2 star resort.  The best part of the stay was seeing the look on the hostess' face when we all showed up at the restaurant for breakfast after being kicked out the night before.  Get those bloody mary's ready bitch.  

If they cut your group off of drinking while dining at the Valley Ho I'd suggest not bypassing the waitress and ordering straight from the bar, it'll get you 86'd faster than trying to dry hump your date in an 8th grade dance."}
{"text":"I was a skeptic at first, thinking that this place was luring people in with it's glossy exterior only to fall short when it comes to actual quality. I was wrong. The Valley Ho is not only fun to utilize as a word-play, it's also a fantastic hotel. 

I will start with the things I didn't like...because there are only a couple and they are relatively minor. 
#1 The in-room coffee. It's by far, THE WORST coffee I've ever had. I've had better cups of instant coffee. The V-Ho is trying real hard on this and I give them an A for effort. But whoever was in charge of selecting the coffee system cares a lot more about appearance and, I'd venture to guess, is not even a recreational coffee drinker. This \"thing\" makes a cup of coffee that looks like sewar water and tastes like dasani. 
Please, V-Ho, I beg of you to re-think your in-room coffee system. 

#2 Smoking at the pool. Yes, the pool is a scene, but I'm really not into having cigarette and cigar smoke wafting in my face all day. 

#3 There is no #3. But I wasn't really crazy about the town of Scottsdale itself. Yes, in March the weather is perfect. But the town is a you-could-be-anywhere town. All the chain restaurants. It feels a little like Disneyland, with everything setup for the tourists. Unless you're here to by art, there's nothing that you will find interesting about this place. After 1 day of looking around, I was content just to hang out and eat at the hotel.

This hotel has great rooms, the beds are superior with delicate, soft linens, a mattress that is both soft & firm, an amazing tub in the middle of the room, ample balcony space, great tv with ipod hookup, and they even brought a DVD player into my room so I could watch movies. 

They also don't nickel & dime you like other hotels: wireless is free and using the gym at the spa (which is pretty good) is free. I like these little touches.

The layout of the rooms is great, you wouldn't think a tub in the middle of the room would work but it does. There's a curtain for privacy if you want it. 

Lastly, the hotel staff were great. Helpful and friendly but not in that \"I am here to be your servant\" kind of way. Maybe it's just me, but they actually seemed genuine. And even if that's an act, I rather liked it."}
{"text":"Such an awesome boutique style hotel... 

I booked my companies National Sales Meeting here and everything was fantastic. The guest rooms, the meeting space, the banquet food during the meetings, the hotel restaurant - Cafe ZuZu, the restaurant behind the hotel - Trader Vics, the accommodating staff, the pool area and jacuzzi and how could I forget cleanliness. Everything here met and exceeded my expectations. 

Noni , the National Sales Manager assisted me with setting up the guest rooms, meeting spaces, catering needs etc. We may have been a headache to her for all the last minute changes we had but she was so patient and very pleasant to work with at all times. The meeting space was great, the room was always setup as we planned; snacks and lunch were always ready on time. 

The hotel room sizes were great, especially for two people sharing a room. The long counter space and large mirrors are especially great for two women sharing a room. Lots of counter space for lots of cosmetics, haha. Great patio attached to the room. Large bathroom again, plenty of counter space and not only does this bathroom have a large tub, but it also has a separate stand up shower and the toilet is in its own little room. Clean, clean, clean and the soaps and moisturizers left out for guest smell fantastic, I think its lavender? 

Cafe Zuzu is always the place to be whether its inside for breakfast... or enjoying a drink at the inside bar or outside on the patio enjoying lunch in the sun. Great food all around. I had the best banana pancakes there for breakfast, the entire time I ate them I had that Jack Johnson song stuck in my head. 

Unfortunately the weather was not nice enough for us to enjoy the pool or cabanas, but some coworkers and I did take some time to enjoy the jacuzzi's and relax. 

The hotel overall impressed my coworkers and I. I definitely plan to go back on my own time to the Valley Ho to vacation."}
{"text":"Great hotel!  One of the most unique hotels I've stayed at.  Great rooms, beds, decor, spa, pool, and property.  Very well manicured and cared-for.  All the staff very very helpful and friendly.  Great massage by Rebecka and facial by Liz!  I hope to come back soon."}
{"text":"I'm almost embarrassed to tell people where I'm staying based on the horrible name, but it's one of my favorite hotels when visiting Phoenix for work.

They take good care of their guests. In fact, when I arrived this time they informed me they had upgraded me to a lovely room with a huge bathtub in the middle of the room. Ah- if only I had time for baths on work trips (or baths at all!). 

I've stayed at The Valley Ho enough times to know that my directionally challenged self will get lost trying to find a room outside. Instead I asked them to instead find a nice room in the tower.  Forget the fancy bathtub (although a shower would be nice!).I just wanted a close room that was clean and somewhat spacious. And I got just that for the little time I actually spent in the room. I probably spent more time getting work done in the lounge. Speaking of, the tomato burrata salad was pretty tasty.

If I was headed to Phoenix for vacation I'd likely stay elsewhere (Montelucia* has proved to be a good option for this in the past), but will continue to visit \"The Ho\" for work travel.

{"text":"The Jetson's meets Sinatra.  Mid-century motel totally remodeled into a modern resort featuring a great pool, classy spa and both an on-site bar/grill and a Trader Vick's in the parking lot.

Walking distance to downtown Scottsdale (literally starts across the street), and the eateries and nightlife.  If you're headed to Scottsdale for Spring Training or a get away weekend you'll be pleasantly surprised,  Not cheap, but a great value.  This place rocks during Spring training so book ahead.

Try the suites on the end of the original two story motel.  the wrap around deck is very relaxing after a busy day in the desert.  The tower is condo'd, so if you want a full kitchen, etc, request that.  The landscaping alone is worth a walk about."}
{"text":"Love the mid-century modern,I know the staff isn't super flexible....however they are being very cooperative about my rehearsal  dinner. 
I guess I'll see how much I love it after this dinner, but my one and only stay there was perfectly acceptable."}
{"text":"The restaurant was decorated perfectly if you enjoy Mad Men - we loved it, they did not miss a detail!  The two bedroom suites two full beds, for four women we were pretty uncomfortable that we would smash into our bed mate in such a small bed.  Dinner at hotel was lovely and pool setting had a nice glow in the evening, would stay again."}
{"text":"My mom and I decided to stay at the Valley Ho while we were in town for a quick trip to AZ for a birthday party. We loved our hotel room and overall we had great experience. I called to see if they had any extra blankets and guest services said they would check and have someone drop it off or call us back to let us know. 

I used my card to hold the reservation however, my mom was the person paying the bill. I checked in without my mom and the next day I was informed I need to submit full payment for the room asap. My mom was paying but wasn't going to be around Scottsdale until later that evening...we were there for a bday party so, they ran my card for partial payment (after telling me they couldn't and wouldn't do this because payment had to be submitted in full). When we arrived later that evening we were locked out of our room and had to go to the front desk to submit full payment. The partial payment is still pending on my account  2 days later. 

Other than that, the room was spacious and I loved the soaking tub, separate shower and large vanity so there was plenty of space to get ready. We didn't really get to check out the amenities because we weren't in our hotel too much however, we stopped by the pool on our last day and it was busy but not too crowded. The music was great and the waitresses were very friendly. Perfect location...close to airport,short drive to Fashion Square and walking distance to boutiques and restaurants."}
{"text":"They have NO extra dog fee. The set up is like a motel so you don't have to walk your dog through the lobby. They do restrict dogs from the common area and from being unattended in the room. Be aware that your dog may bark when hearing outside noises. We didn't get a chance to enjoy the facilities as this was a quick stop on a longer trip. We were able to bring our pittie and labradoodle in from the parking lot without a problem."}
{"text":"I live across the street, and have visited Hotel Valley Ho for breakfast, brunch, and dinner more times than I'd like to admit. One perk about living at The Standard is that you can also order room service to the apartments. The most recent visit was last night, 2/1/2018 and was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had in my life. The M.A.L.T (music, attitude, lights, temperature) was spot on, and our server, Alex went above and beyond. We ordered the Tartare, Oysters, Scallops, and Short Ribs and I can hole-heartedly say that every dish exceeded my expectations. Even the General Manager stopped at our table to introduce herself, and you could feel that the customer service here is genuine. We received a complimentary snack of 2 Rockefeller oysters, which I've never had and LOVED THEM! The special of the night was Chilean Sea Bass was by far the best I've ever had from coast to coast. I cannot say enough about the quality of food and service and will recommend dining here to everyone and anyone I know."}
{"text":"I'm one of the producers of Arizona Cocktail Week and we've hosted our event here for four years in a row and we wouldn't think of moving it anywhere else!  The staff is very accommodating, the rooms are retro-hip (some even have a tub in the middle of the room) and Cafe Zuzu has an AMAZING breakfast.  Go for the California Eggs Benedict!  I have it every time I stay there.

It's also only about 10-15 minutes from the airport and right in Old Town Scottsdale - super convenient."}
{"text":"I kept hoping I would run into Don Draper.  

No.  I'm serious.  Where was he?  

Even though I had no luck finding my Mad Man, I still had a great two night stay at the Valley Ho.  This retro style (mid-century modern style) takes you back to a time where The Jetsons were the future and motor inns were the norm.  However, the decor has the millennial twist to it so you don't feel like you're staying at with the Bradys.  

My room was fantastic, comfy bed (not so comfy pillows), great patio and awesome bathroom.  I loved the tub, even though I didn't get a chance to actually use it.  It looked pretty, 'nuff said.  

I also loved the pool and adjacent hot tub.  Even though I was out there with girlfriends, I think my most favorite part of the trip was just hanging out by the pool, listening to some tunes and drinking John Daly's.  Mmmm....Laying out, with people splashing in the pool and the hotel in the background....if you squint just right you may get your Don Draper apparition.  Or so I hoped I would, with the help of my friend, John Daly.
  
Also, poolside bar service was amazing.  Our waitress was great and I loved that servers constantly came around just making sure you had water to stay hydrated.  

So why four stars?  A couple of bratty gripes actually.  Roomie saw a bug in the bathroom.  Yea, I get it.  Its Arizona and all, but I don't want bugs in my trendy hotel room.  Also, housekeeping came super late, like after 5pm late.  We actually asked a the front desk if that was normal.  Lastly, despite really liking the food at Zuzu, the service was disgrace.  Otherwise, I really enjoyed my stay here.  I'm not sure when I will return to Scottsdale, but if I do, I know where I'm staying!"}
{"text":"We checked in early on a saturday. The rooms and common areas are nice with pretty interiors. The rooms are spacious and quiet. The pool is nice and they were attentive with their service. Some things we were not crazy about included a 5:55 am wake up call that we did not request. Also the maid entered our room without knocking. These were both on the first day. Our stay would have been better if not for these events which typically do not happen when we travel. The other good things are that the hotel is in a good location with lots of restaurants and things to do nearby. Might stay here again."}
{"text":"Out of all the retro - but restored - throwback, boutique-ey hotels I've ever stayed at, Hotel Valley Ho is one of the cutest, more cozier stays. This mid-century modern hotel features rooms with open patios with direct access to the pool, Red Flower bath products, massive counter space in the restroom and the bedroom, a deep, plunging tub and shower (some, in the middle of the room http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hotel-valley-ho-scottsdale?select=-cUKl1xqRVx3dPcoDOQTAA#zwtvQtPIDeJ9ab2cZTLBXg) which is totes baller style, platform beds ... I was in heaven. 

To top it off, there are two pools, a spa, a restaurant/cafe, gym, bar, fire pits, and a few hotel activities, like Thursday night yoga at the pool hosted by Lululemon. (I partook in that and it was amazing.)"}
{"text":"Had a lovely one-night staycation here as a weekday couple's retreat. The room was huge, extremely clean and there were all kinds of little touches that made the atmosphere very posh.  Great decorations, we loved the separate shower stall, bathtub, and toilet stall area with \"mood\" lighting, lots of counter space, and great-sized private patio area with a huge lounger for two.  

Since it was summer and a weekday, the property was very private, we felt the pool was ours for the taking! GIANT pool area, well maintained, clean, and beautiful.  The jacuzzi definitely could have been hotter in temperature, but that was our only complaint.  We didn't try the restaurant, but the bar had a great atmosphere too!  All the staff were friendly and helpful, it was easy to get a complimentary late check-out, and overall a professional experience. 

Conveniently located to everything in Old Town Scottsdale, this place is a def new fave, especially since I found a Kayak deal which made my overnight here only $90!  Thanks for a great staycation!"}
{"text":"Love cafe ZuZu!!!! Its a very comfortable and chill setting to be in either at the bar, cafe or outside by the pool!!!"}
{"text":"Stayed here with my sister the night before she got married - and what a perfect place it was! Not only did they accommodate a super late check-in, they sent up chocolate covered strawberries when they heard my sis was getting married.  We stayed in an enormous suite (for about $400/night) complete with wrap around patio that was perfect for the bridal party to get ready in - all 10 of us! Pricey but worth it! While we didn't partake, the pool was pretty and looked like a ton of fun. It was a perfect beginning to my sister's wonderful wedding day!"}
{"text":"This is the coolest hotel in Scottsdale.  Retro, big rooms, fun pool, great lobby to hangout in.  It's right in Old Town, so lots to do, great restaurants and bars in walking distance.  If you get a room in the tower, ask to face the pool, and the cabana king rooms are definitely worth the extra price."}
{"text":"Valley Ho although a nice boutique hotel their customer service is the WORST.

We had a very small private event in a suite and from the moment we checked in they were on a rant to evict us.

We didn't have blaring music or crazy antics and were bothered my management twice. They actually took measures to evict us and call the police for a private event. 

NEVER AGAIN will I, my associates or any of theirs will step foot there again.  Be forewarned ALCOHOL is not allowed in Private suites. 
I guess the mini bar has a high profit margin!"}
{"text":"Don't forget, even if you are not staying at the hotel you are welcome to get a pass and use the pool.. Ahh a nice place to catch some rays in the heated pool and a fun place to people watch."}
{"text":"Holy douche bag central!  It's places like these is the reason why I don't frequent Scottsdale too often.  It's full of douche bags.  The hotel is a trendy hotel and people like to be seen at trendy places.  I try to avoid them, but in this case I had no choice.  The rooms are really nice, but definitely not worth the price.  I mean it's Scottsdale people, not a mega metropolis where you can get these room rates.  Try to avoid the pool at all costs because it is full of meat heads and girls who are gold diggers.  But if that's your sort of thing have at it, because I don't want it!"}
{"text":"Considering the price and city, this hotel totally deserves 5 stars for it's interesting styling and great design choices. The exterior of the hotel rooms has a retro feeling, while the interiors are furnished with modern furniture and decorations. The extra large tub (cornered by 2 frosted glass walls) even has a mood light shining down on it. You probably won't find another hotel this chic in all of Arizona.

If I ever come back to the Phoenix area again, I will be sure to book at this hotel again. It gets my highest recommendation.

Price Tip: Smartphone users should use the HotelTonight App, which will run last minute deals for this hotel."}
{"text":"The quick review: this place is a party hotel.  Do not come here if you expect a relaxing, peaceful experience.

The more detailed review:
After staying at the Four Seasons for four nights, we wanted to stay somewhere new and a bit closer to the airport on Saturday night for our 6:30am flight on Sunday morning.  I checked up on this place on the Tablet website, and Hotel Valley Ho seemed right up our alley: chic, fun, and different with excellent styling.  We expected a lovely, peaceful ending to our anniversary trip to Scottsdale.  Unfortunately, lovely and peaceful are the polar opposites of what we experienced during our stay.  I am a fairly diligent vacation planner and sought out places with a reasonably calm vibe, so you can imagine my surprise when my husband and I walked in to see a pool party straight out of Can't Hardly Wait.  We were a bit stunned but hoped that things would eventually settle down because we couldn't cancel at that point.

Our bellman, James, was very helpful and explained the history of the hotel as we proceeded up to our room (\"with a great view of the pool party!\" said the man at check-in) in the new tower.  The hotel has a very, very interesting story.  James' help was seriously the highlight of our stay.  When we stepped into our room, he pulled open the curtains to reveal the zoo down below and said that usually the gathering is much bigger.  I originally thought I would head down and make a decent attempt at enjoying the party, but a quick aerial view of the pool showed that the pool was nearly full, almost every chair was occupied, and finding two chairs together would likely be a waste of time.  The music from the pool could be heard clearly through our closed balcony door and curtains in our room.  I understand that I am a bit more conservative than a typical 28-year-old, but honestly, this was simply too much for me.   We were told that we wouldn't be able to switch to a room that would block out the music from the DJ, so my husband and I simply left the hotel to drive around the city for awhile and wait for the party to end.

Fast-forwarding eight hours, we returned to a packed lobby, bar, and restaurant.  The sound in the lobby was definitely booming.  We shared an elevator with several loud, rowdy guests  (that were, surprisingly, old enough to be my parents)  that all left on the \"party floor!!!!!!!\" below us.  We arrived back at our room around 11:00 to find that the pool party was moved next door.  The volume of their music was outrageous and we had to call the front desk to beg them to send someone up after our neighbors wouldn't answer their door.  I didn't even try to do anything about the loud door-slamming and yelling in the hallway at various times at night.  It wasn't worth the effort to address.

Because I now know that I could have done a better job checking out the hotel online, I can't justify giving my experience less than three stars, but I do feel that my experience was less than \"a-ok.\"  I'm very disappointed that I stayed here and I can't recommend this hotel if you're seeking anything quieter than a frat party.  It's just not . . . civilized.

A few other notes:
--Valet parking is apparently the only option for guests (or, at least, that's what we were told when we arrived).  This is a charge of $14 per day.
--A business center with complimentary internet access and printing is available.
--The styling in the hotel is, indeed, beautiful.
--The spa prices seem to be very reasonable.
--The beds are exceptionally comfortable!
--The service from James was wonderful."}
{"text":"Stayed here NYE 2007. Our room was large and I loved the bright colors and funky decor. But the big bathtub was the best part. I needed to soak for awhile after a long night of partying. The bed was really comfortable too, but I pretty much could have passed out anywhere at that point. The balcony was also large and overlooked the pool, and had some great lounge chairs, but I wish it was more private. A sail doesn't do much to give you some privacy from your neighbors.  

Room service was also great the next morning when I needed some water, 7-up and toast to help my hangover."}
{"text":"My wife and I had the privilege of staying here last weekend for a staycation. I have to say it was the best one we have had yet. The hotel was AMAZING!!!! And the staff went above and beyond. To give you an example my phone was almost dead when we arrived and I forgot my charger. The women working the front desk noticed and offered to charge it for me while I took my bags to my room. And the pool, wow it was great. Cheap drinks and plenty of place to lounge unlike many other pools in the area. Thanks again Valley Ho for making last weekend one to remember. Can't wait till next time."}
{"text":"LOOOOOOVE Valley Ho!  Love the vibe - the mid-century modern decor, large rooms, spacious bathrooms and balconies with loungers!  I even loved the provided bath products (and I almost never use the stuff the hotel provides).  I loved them so much I bought some fromt he spa to take home!  We had the best service too - from valet to front desk to pool staff - everyone was just superb!  I would absolutely return and recommend this place to friends and family!  

Location is great too - walkable to great shops and restaurants!"}
{"text":"We were married here one year ago. Do not get married here. 
Here were just a couple of the disappointments. there were more, i promise. It was very disorganized.  We had a lot of rain and had ro move from the rooftop. Dawn, our wedding planner, said she was coordinating all this. Not true. My husband didn't even know what area we were getting married in and went to the rooftop! Dawn had not been there to help, to guide or even update him on the change!! Umm. .. He was the groom and needed to know!! There was no coordination by our so-called wedding planner. My girls did not know when to go. It was so incredibly disorganized.  The second major disappointment was about the shrimp cocktail hors d'ouvre. We were VERY VERY VERY clear that we wanted one shrimp cocktail served in a shot glass ... one per guest... instead they serve just watered down ceviche. When we approached dawn .... as I saw the ceviche go by, I asked her to please change it to the shrimp cocktail that we discussed. Dawn said that she would. 10 minutes later I checked again (as we try to get pictures done) and it was still the wrong order. After the wedding we call Dawn on several occasions  to discuss. Brace yourself... she said too bad; I guess everybody must have been happy because they ate it. HELLO?! WE were not happy!  This was our wedding and we did not want to serve ceviche in a shot glass and have people shoot it back!!! We wanted to serve a shrimp cocktail in a shot glass hanging off the side which we were very very very clear about. Dawn said that she would refund the shrimp cocktail; she never did.  My husband called her again; she never responded. I called her again; she never responded. On the 4th attempt she said I'll send you guys a voucher for a free night stay during the summer. Well that voucher never came and we've been married over a year!! I would steer clear if you want a very elegant wedding done just the way you want. It is still so upsetting a year later. Bottom line: It wasn't cheap and wasn't done right."}
{"text":"Stayed here for a week last year and had a blast. Very fun vibe, great bars, party pool, fun decor. Guest service was top notch. 

I recommend the poolside suites. Great patios to hang out and drink and have a good time. 

Only downside was that my key had to be replaced a dozen times. They are easily de-magnetized."}
{"text":"Overall we had a pretty good stay. we stayed 4 nights. we got a deal, and payed 600 for our stay. our room was prepaid. only 3 stars because at check in the $100 per day hold was not explained which ultimately put a $400 hold on my debit card, and caused my account to overdraft twice from automatic payments that were preset to come out of my account. another reasons for the three stars is the fact that the room service food was not good at all, however the hotel restaurant zuzu had great food, we ate there twice. overall the stay was good, apart from those two mishaps. this was our first time in arizona, we did not bring bug spray, it's definitely a must, as we were bitten several times by mosquitos, which is obviously not the hotel's fault, just thought this tip was worth mentioning. also the room was huge, located on the first floor by the pool, the patio have access to the pool, very convenient.

**Update**
I appreciate the hotel's response and have supplied them with requested information about room service. 

I realized that I forgot to mention something that we did find bothersome during our stay. In the threshold of the room entrance there are several bugs nested around the light. We saw this same situation on the overhead lighting right  outside of the building, which is understandable, but to deal with having to speed in and out of the room to ensure the bugs dont get us or get into the room was a bit annoying, especially since our room opened up to a hallway indoors as opposed to some of the rooms where the entrance opened up to right outside, where the bug thing would be more understandable. 

*Not trying to bash the hotel, just wanted to bring it to their attention, because if we noticed, future guests wil notice as well.*

It was overall still a good stay."}
{"text":"This review is for the VHSpa. We booked our annual holiday spa day for three of us with three treatments each.
We knew the spa was under construction so they weren't operating in their usual room, instead we had hotel rooms for our treatment rooms and our lounge area. The technicians maneuvered is easily and we didn't miss the spa area.
First I had the coffee berry facial. Liz was amazing and worked her magic on my problematic skin with ease.
Next was the relaxation massage with Kerry, seriously one of the best massages I've ever had.
Finally a pedicure with Caty, I actually fell asleep I was so relaxed.
I feel pampered and ready for the holiday!"}
{"text":"Fantastic hotel, best service experimcez lo location is great with ring walking distance to art galleries, restaurants,  and shops. Very cool pool experience and food and beverages options. 

I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a unique experience."}
{"text":"Hotel has great decor and friendly service. Rooms are clean and spacious. 

Pool area can get crowded. Good for bachelorette parties.

When we stayed there there was a live band playing."}
{"text":"Totally dug the50's feel here!
Massage--best I ever had.  It was with Rebecca.  She's tiny but mighty.  At first I thought it wasn't going to be very good, but, one minute after that thought and I realized she was intuitive, skilled and strong.  Amazing experience.  
Spa facilities otherwise are good, not amazing.
The pool was a fun experience though with friendly servers, tasty specials, comfortable chairs, options of shade from umbrellas, lively music and complimentary floats for the pool.  
Such a fun place!"}
{"text":"Outside of the name which a friend mentioned was appropo (shut it!) this place totally rocks! Decked out in '50's Andrew Lloyd Wright-esque decor, the staff is very customer service focused. The comfy bed, sweet smelling amenities, awesome pool area and price make this place a must-stay next time I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Great spot! Stood there a second time around and had a great time! We will continue to use the Valley Ho as our go to staycation spot!"}
{"text":"Do you like mid century modern? Do you love friendly staff? Then this is the place for you!

Pool, bar, spa, restaurant and hotel staff are young, friendly and accommodating. Always a smile and a good word. Too many ways they went above and beyond to accommodate our requests. They like to have fun along with their guests.  Really appreciate that. 

The room was clean and modern and spacious. Nice touches abound- comfy beds and lounge chairs and bath salts. They thought of everything. I wish there was a mini fridge for non minibar items but all was expected. 

Had a massage. It was great. 

Ate the food. It was great. Good drinks. 

Sahsha at the pool was a lifesaver! Kept me in sav blanc. 

We'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Loved this hotel.  Great staff.  The pool staff very accommodating.  The bar staff is exceptional - the bar supervisor was amazing.  The room was small but functional.  Very nice joint."}
{"text":"\"it's just so cool\" is all i kept saying. 

my girlfriend and I (yes lesbians) went here for a great mini vaca for my birthday weekend. we arrived friday night to a FULL Zuzu bar, which was entertaining. the crowd seemed to be having a great time.

i told my gf that all i wanted, was a  hotel with a steam room...this hotel has that and more. and i will add, this was the best steam room i have ever been in. the steam was so foggy i couldn't see across the little room.

i clean houses for a living. these were/are the cleanest rooms i have ever seen. EVER. the shower doors are glass, and i couldn't find ONE water spot. the beds are fabulous, and you can even purchase the pillows. 

we were in bldg 6, first floor with a walk out patio. i enjoyed the 2 seating options; table with two chairs and a chase lounger thing.

we had decided prior to arriving that we were going to be pool side most of saturday afternoon. most other reviews talk about how great the people watching is...

saturday poolside at the valley ho is the best people watching i think i have ever had. purely delicious bodies. beautiful people. all shapes and sizes. the dj kept many people dancing...and the waitstaff kept everyone hydrated. even down to the water glasses. it was just a great mix of visual stimulation.

drinks at the pool are mixed well, and worth the $10. beers were moderately priced...and everything could be charged to the room. bonus.

the room service, as many reviews also say...was a bit pricey. that's why we walked down to the daily dose saturday am. breakfast, lunch dinner all day!

the spa products that are in the spa bath area are amazing. the scent was delicious, and the face soap rocked. 

parking...there is valet for $14 a night. boo. a small limited self parking lot is available."}
{"text":"I was here the last night of my road trip and it certainly did not disappoint. 

Wonderfully comfortable bed, huge window and sliding doors that led to a balcony, bathtub in the middle of the room, fantastic pool area, retro awesome furniture. It's like being in Arizona's version of a Vegas resort or being on the set of Blow before things turned sour for Depp's character.

Check out is at noon -- plenty of time to enjoy the pool before leaving this slice of paradise behind."}
{"text":"Front desk staff was friendly and provided information about how to get to my room. The stay was unpleasant, considering that the AC unit was fairly ineffective. Further, construction next to the hotel is loud. Woke up earlier than necessary because of the construction noise. Ate at Cafe Zuzu and was disappointed by the wait staff, who made me feel as if taking my order and delivering my meal was a burden. (No absurd requests made, ordered from the menu as listed). Server did not give me the option to pay for my meal, instead charged to hotel stay invoice. Afterward, I received a large bill for my hotel stay. Wish the front desk would have explained that they place a hold on your credit card (maybe it's listed somewhere on the paper describing check out times). However, front desk staff just said to initial and sign. If explained, this would have spared the time discussing with the accountant regarding the large bill. Overall, not place I'd recommended to stay. However, the hotel design is appealing..."}
{"text":"My wife, 1 year old daughter, and I stayed at the Hotel Valley Ho for spring break. It turned out to be a great decision! We had picked the hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews. We were pleasantly surprised to also find out that it is a 4 diamond AAA hotel as well. 

We were most pleased with the location and the facilities. With a 1 year old we needed to be close to convenience shops, grocery, etc. and that was definitely the case. It was also great to be able to take walks in Old Town Scottsdale. We also were able to take the short 5 minute drive to Camelback Mountain for a hike. 

We definitely wanted to experience all the hotel had to offer, and the pool, spa, and restaurant did not disappoint. The pool and hot tubs were at good temperatures. The poolside bar and service was nice and inexpensive. Our massages were also at a great price thanks to a weekday promotion. The restaurant also had a weekday happy hour which we took advantage of twice during our stay with $3 drinks and $5 appetizers that were delicious. 

It seems that the hotel also draws a nice, diverse crowd. We saw couples, small families, larger families, and the facilities were not too crowded. We were nervous about the noise level with our little one, but that totally turned out to be a non-factor. She was able to get all of her naps in and sleep well through the night.

The room itself was fantastic! The bed was comfortable. The shower had great pressure and temperature. The lighting was perfect. The balcony was serene. We loved our room!

We really only had a few small complaints with our stay. Our breakfast room service came 30 minutes early one day. However, I did change it half way through the order, so I am sure they just wrote the first time down and forgot to change it. Also, one night I turned the A/C down to a cooler temp, and I don't know if that caused it, but we had a wet spot on the carpet underneath the A/C the next morning. Actually, the most annoying thing was that all of the in-room refrigerators were taken and we had to continually get ice to keep milk for our baby cold. 

Overall, we loved our stay at the Hotel Valley Ho, and would love to go back! It is definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"I think the best way to describe this place is that it is a \"grower not a shower\"! 
Staying for 3 nights in May for our anniversary was a fun choice for adventure, location & affordability! 
The highlights are: 
The walkable distance to tons of local down town fun,
the friendly staff, the delicious Bath Amenities, the passable pool w great lounge chair service, 
and the 24 hour room service that takes less than 30 mins on average... 
The part that fails to impress is the fact that the entire set up is basically a Motel 7 if run by the Jetsons! 
The grounds are lush enough and we were lucky to not overpay too much (thanks to Expedia) to stay in a spot (5201) where we could only barely view the parking lot and had what some might consider a semi-private balcony on the second floor, baring that there are people on the walkway entering and exiting their rooms across the way who can see you at all times... 
We gather maybe the Tower rooms facing the Mountain would be the most fun but while we requested \"the tallest floor possible\" this was apparently not an option (although it was listed as cheaper than what we paid for our second floor motel set up) Lame sauce!
Yes, the bath tub w mood lighting in our room was a plus and yes, the TV sucks but who cares?!?
 Also the Valet parking was such a cluster-F when we pulled in at 6pm on Thurs that we ended up self parking at the Sands lot and having the bellhop help us in w our luggage from there and it was a great choice so we had easy access to our vehicle all weekend w/out the hassle of the valet kids and the $15 a day fee...
So our general consensus was that this was a fun place to stay but there is little-to-no luxury to be had, so if you don't come expecting any you won't be let down!"}
{"text":"About a month and a half ago, I was scouring Orbitz, Travelocity, Hotels.com and just about every other travel site around trying to find a sweet deal on airfare and hotel to a little city called Phoenix. A few options popped up and they all sounded fairly cool, but then I saw it, my destiny, my path and the ONLY hotel for me, yep, the VALLEY HO!

Having grown up in the San Fernando Valley and having been called a Ho a few times in my life, what better place to stay right? I mean, hey, talk about feeling at home, hehe. When I perused their website it looked really 50's mod with some loungey and groovy shagaliscious features and while that is soooo not my style, I figured, what the hell, live a little and try something new or at least new with a retro twist. 

Once I arrived, I instantly felt the need to work my hair into a sassy bouffant, clearly I didn't, but the desire was definitely there. I then toured the grounds and tried to find my \"wing,\" yes this hotel is so big it has wings. Sweet. I then found my room and opened up the door and I think I just checked into my Dad's wardrobe in the 70's.

My Dad was an Ad cat you see. Advertising was his game and flashy suits and a gold caddie was his MO. (No, my Dad wasn't a pimp) Now sitting in this room I am surrounded by turquoise walls, gold curtains and a lime green headboard. It's awesome and sooo groovy. The bathroom is a trip too. It's like Star Trek meets Austin Powers meets, um, the color aqua blue. It's got a HUGE bathtub (yay!), weird doors that look like they are from outer space and a big bowl sink to splash your face in.

The bed is SOOOO awesome too. A huge cabana king and the bed you wanna be a HO in!!! Any takers? C'mon, the room's on me!! hehe. Yeah, this hotel pretty much rocks and I would highly recommend staying here for a nifty little adventure while out of town...or even in town...nooner anyone?

As for the room service, the mac n cheese is awesome, as is the grilled cheese AND they have Red Stripe, which is just automatic cool points right there. The wifi is FREEE (why can't more hotels do that?!) and the staff is courteous, friendly and just plain grand.

Thanks for making this Valley HO at HOme here! You guys rock!"}
{"text":"My first time staying here. Just got a nice make over. Rooms are big, clean, and very stylish. I loved the bathroom and the large patio on the ground floor with the extra large chase lounge. 

The lobby bar is great (albeit drinks are a bit $$) and surprisingly a great place to meet people. They also have a great grilled cheese sandwich! 

Hotel staff was excellent. They have valet parking, but save yourself $14 and use the self park. It is not that bad. The location of the hotel is great is easy access to all of downtown Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I loved every aspect of my recent stay at HVH! Is it weird that I had the Jetson's theme song stuck in my head most of the trip? From the moment you pull up, you feel like you're inside someone's idea of the future. From the mid-century furniture to the color palette, you're inside a Sirkian melodrama for sure. 

Until, that is, you arrive in your nicely appointed room and see the updated rooms with huge soaking tubs, glass showers, a veritable wall of mirrors and a nice flat screen. In my room, the patio doors opened onto a veranda with nice outdoor furniture, and provided a healthy dose of Scottsdale sunshine right inside my room. 

Well-stocked minibar and snacks, and a wonderful in-room dining menu rounded out a perfect stay. Every interaction I had with any member of the staff here was tops, and the pool areas are gorgeous. A lively outdoor patio bar scene made me feel like I was right in the middle of something really fun, and the in-room continental breakfast I had on my last morning was worth every penny."}
{"text":"An absolute pleasure to work with the banquets and event team. Extremely accommodating, friendly, timely, and helpful.  As a marketing and events  coordinator, my job is stressful and to have the help from working with this hotel, took a huge weight off my shoulders. Excellent food, awesome staff,  gorgeous rooms...I cannot say enough about this place! We will be back and you should come too!! Ask to work with Lee and Josh :-)"}
{"text":"Spent a week here for a conference.  Rooms are great, but would have liked a frig.  Be aware that the second story can only be reached by stairs,if you have bags to carry.  Fantastic mid century design and great tunes piped in the lobby and restaurant.  Food and service terrific.  Great staff.  I would like to spend more time here."}
{"text":"Great hotel, and well deserving of just about all the praise it's received, both for the decor and the incredible value. Sadly, I can't give them five stars because they wouldn't let me check out at 1pm instead of noon. Never mind the fact that they never once cleaned my room before 4 pm.

That's the kind of pettiness that puts a bad taste in your mouth after a perfectly good stay."}
{"text":"The reason I'm writing an update to this review is now I've experienced a the workout room and the king suite. If you have the opportunity to get a king suite, just do it. Huge closets, full kitchen, giant patio, & a washer and dryer are some of the reasons you definitely need to splurge."}
{"text":"We were happy to have arrived at the hotel at 10 am and still be able to check into our room. We were in room 1101, right by the entrance and on ground level which proved very nice being so close to the pool. Our room was nice and cool, clean and welcoming when we arrived and it was even nicer to be able to request a DVD player and mini fridge. The mini fridge that was already there was stocked fully with delicious alcohols and treats, but we didn't imbibe, knowing the cost would be great if we started popping those mini bottles. 

We wandered out to the pool (Sunday) and it was semi busy and sunbathed for a short while. The rest of the week it was nice and calm without too many people, we were glad we decided to go during the week because we've heard it gets rowdy on weekends with the DJ, which would be great if Brooke and I weren't such hermit nerds. 
The drinks were decent enough at the pool bar, and the waitstaff were very helpful and attentive. Ice water was provided frequently and freely (thank goodness!) and the towels were abundant. The pool was a bit dirty with bottle caps at the bottom of it and bugs floating about, but what can you do. 

We did have a leak from our shower that dripped into the bathroom area, but we didn't want to move rooms just because we liked the location so we put up with sopping it up with towels. I was a bit disappointed with the leak though. The shampoos and condioners smelled delicious and house keeping did a nice job of making our beds fresh and clean, so that helped make up for the wet bathroom floor. The tub was spacious and we only noticed one bug in the room the entire time, which is pretty good I suppose. I don't know what the insect life is like in Arizona usually.

Overall, we were happy with our stay at Valley Ho. I'm not sure if it's quite my  \"scene\" in general and I would definitely stay away on weekends and busy Summer nights if you like something a bit calmer, but it was a great vacation and Valley Ho helped make that happen."}
{"text":"Style over substance.  It's beautiful, but I had many issues with the room - including an uncomfortable bed.   The management did try to make it right and I appreciate it, but I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"My family stayed here this past summer while visiting me and had a great time.  It is a little pricey but it really is a beautiful property and they take good care of their guests.  The pool is a nightmare in the daytime as it is filled with Scottsdale's finest (most obnoxious) rich kids, but other than that it is a fun place.  The restaurants are nice and the staff is very friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Fabulous hotel, restaurant and spa. If you are into midcentury, retro design you will  appreciate the decor at this place. The spa has some great deals on Wed and Thursday nights- $60 for a 60 minute massage! And the therapists are all great! Locals looking for a good spa experience without the pricetag should check it out."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed here for a weekend and it's amazing. The hotel feels like a resort and you could easily spend a day or two doing nothing but eating and drinking at the wonderful bar and restaurant ZuZu's and hanging out by the pool. It's also walking distance to old town Scottdale. The staff is lovely and our room was very relaxing. WIll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I got in late, around 11:30 and so the front desk girl was (I guess) tired and cranky. She stuck me in a far away room and up stairs (I had 3 large pieces of luggage to reorganize since I'm on a long roadtrip. The restaurant is advertised on yelp as open till midnight, it's not (closes at 10 pm). I called to ask for a closer room and she said they were full. Funny the parking lot is empty. And my \"hip suite\" is facing a parking lot with a view of trucking containers. I posted a photo. The only redeeming quality is kind of cool decor."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Valley Ho last week.  We had a King room in the Tower with a view of the pool.  Everything was terrific (room, food, friendly staff and good service).  We ordered room service our first night after a long day of travel.  The filet mignon was of high quality and comparable to anything you'd find in a fine steakhouse.  The hotel is also walkable to most everything. 

We plan to stay at the Valley Ho again next year."}
{"text":"The Valley Ho hits all the right buttons with me. I love the retro/vintage feel, the immaculate grounds, the great lobby, and the surprisingly good Cafe ZuZu inside.

I've stayed in enough blah-dee-blah hotels around the country that when something has its own personality and soul, it's a welcome and refreshing change. I spent a few nights here in a comfortable room with a comfy bed. There was enough room to stretch out, and the bathroom--a glass surrounded pod that extended into the room--had a bonus separate tub and shower.

Speaking of the tub, I went to turn on the lights on day 2 of my stay, and saw that one switch had \"mood\" written above it. I didn't recognize that brand of switch plate, and I flipped the switch. On comes this swanky colored light over the bathtub. Oh....MOOD.

The hotel is spread out around the pool area. Each door enters from the outside, but it's all covered and it's not too frequent that it's going to be raining anyway.

Housekeeping was very thorough, the staff was very accommodating and friendly. Rates were reasonable--more than you'd pay for a quick in-and-out chain but definitely a value for the experience.

A couple of things to mention. First, I hate valet parking. It's not you, it's me. The valets were super efficient and speedy, but it's the whole concept that drives me batty. The other thing to consider, is that because of the long walkways that pass all the doors, sometimes rowdy people come back to their room late and get a little noisy. If you're one of the last rooms, you don't hear much of it, but when you're closer to the lobby you hear them go by more frequently.

Overall, I was totally impressed. Great touches without being cheesy and going overboard. Modern in its efficiencies but swanky and sexy in its throwback."}
{"text":"I am on the last day of a three day seminar at this lovely retro 50's styled Hotel. The conference rooms Soho 1&2 were standard fare full service from a pleasant staff. I don't know what the cost of that end was but it was high quality and likely expensive. The restaurant ZUZU was Moderately expensive but VERY Tasty! The bread was AWSOME Lightly salted sorta like a pretzel ... Hot and soft reminiscent of Hawaiian Sweet bread. Ohhh Yeah! Although I didn't stay in the hotel It was a great hotel Im sure. Thats All Folks!"}
{"text":"I just returned from a trip to Scottsdale and staying at Hotel Valley Ho. 

Have a seat, get a drink and get comfy. This is going to be a doozy. 

I picked up my rental car & headed to Hotel Valley Ho. The entrance to the hotel is off the main road & actually 'behind' it. Kinda strange but I thought maybe it was an \"AZ\" thing. I pull up to check-in and I'm told that it's valet parking ($14/day) if I want to leave my car to go check-in. I ask where I should park if I want to self-park. I am told that it's next door in the Trader Vic's parking lot. 

So I turn the car around and go park 'next door'. Let me say that it is NOT close and there are no sidewalks! So you end up walking on the road as you can't push your luggage through the grass. 

So after I walk back to the front of the hotel to check-in, the first thing I encounter is a group of drunken girls in bikinis hooting & hollering at the valet staff. They are having some sort of flirtatious interaction and I thought \"What did I get myself info?\"

I check-in without too much trouble & I head up to the 6th floor to my room. The room seems nice enough although I found a little odd at first that some of my light switches didn't appear to 'do' anything. I leave to meet a gf for dinner so I don't bother to try to figure out what's going on. 

We head to dinner & arrive back to the hotel around 9pm. It is now dark in Scottsdale as the sun has set. I had to walk to the hotel from the Trader Vic's parking lot (in the dark, on the street since there is no sidewalk). I did not feel safe AT ALL and there is not great lighting along the walk back to the hotel. 

I retreat to my room and think that maybe I'll take a bath since the tub is so large and deep. That is one thing that is 'good' about the hotel is the bathroom is nice & over-sized. 

I now realize that my lights aren't working since the room is so dark. It's quite strange as there's no reason why it shouldn't be. I proceed to mess with all the switches in the room and still can't turn on anything but the entry way lights. 

I call the front desk to ask for assistance. The girl tells me she'll send maintenance up. 20 mins go by - nothing. Shocker. I call again and am rudely told that she'll try again to call maintenance. A gentlemen finally shows up but I hear him knocking next door. I open my door and ask him if he means to come to my room. 

He tells me that he has to go next door to check the circuit breaker. Sure enough, somehow the lights in MY room got turned off because of the circuit breaker. Why would you check someone into a room and have it have bad light switches?

Another odd side note: There was no hotel directory in the room. You know, the one that tells you when the pool's open, what they offer in the hotel. But they had plenty of books & magazines for you to read. So I kept having to call the front desk if I had a question. 

I had purchased wifi ($9.99 for 1MB or $14.99 for 3MB) and it was incredibly slow. It was to be 24 hours for that fee. I had a business meeting for half the day and I returned around 8pm. When I attempted to re-connect to the wifi, it wasn't working. 

Now I'm a tech savvy girl, it was clear the router was down & needed a reboot. When I called the front desk (again), I was told that they'd have to send the IT guy up as 'they can't troubleshoot'. 

So after a long sweaty workout in their \"24 hour gym\", I had to sit and wait for the IT guy to come to my room. It was the same guy who had been the maintenance guy. He watches me try to connect to the wifi and it fail. And then his solution was to have me wire in via USB. 

It worked after a few attempts but what's the point of wifi if you're going to have to wire in? 

Then in the morning, I was going to check my email before I flew out and found that the \"24 hour internet service\" I paid for apparently reset at midnight. So instead of having a real '24 hour' clock, I had a 15 hour clock. That is ridiculous to charge $14.99 for internet that didn't work half the time and then timed out earlier than it should have. 

The pool was nice although I never got to spend any time 'in' it. I tried to catch some sun before I had to head out for the day. It was absolutely dead. Quiet. When I returned home at 4pm and debated the pool, it was full of douches. They had opened up a bar and DJ booth and the music was clear all the way up to my 6th floor closed door patio. 

I can see why some reviewers have said the scene is all about eye candy. 

I also had breakfast in Cafe Zuzu one morning and the waitress was horrible. (I'll write a separate review about that). 

Overall, the hotel had potential to be nice but they lost it all in the lack of service and the \"I don't care\" attitude. 

If you don't want to be in hospitality, then don't. But don't punish those who travel for the fact that you are miserable. It also was quite steep (over $200/night) and don't feel it offered anything worthy of that. 

I'll never make an appearance again."}
{"text":"A party hotel decorated by Ikea.

Like Ikea, the hotel is a bit of a maze - the entrance is around the back and you have to navigate around the hotel grounds to locate your retro bungalow. Despite this, it's a comfy stay with a fun atmosphere!

Guests, especially those visiting Arizona, should understand that the Valley Ho is a destination for the party crowd on the sunny and dry weekends when Phoenicians are looking for refreshing libations.  You'll find this group at the pool where security is tight in an attempt to keep the pool restricted to guests (at no avail).

Be prepared to socialize and stay up late with the many local attractions.  While it's not the best idea to walk from the hotel, a cab ride will quickly whisk you to Old Town Scottsdale.

I definitely recommend this as a fun spot to stay.  If you're looking for peace and quiet, this is not your hotel.  Enjoy a little free-spirited fun at the Valley Ho."}
{"text":"Beautiful Mid Century modern hotel. 2nd time here. Clean and beautiful. Great customer service!!!   This hotel rocks!!!  #eastmesakaraterocks"}
{"text":"Apparently upwards of $70 million dollars was spent a few years back to restore this venerable property back to its mid-century grandeur.  This hotel oozes retro cool and it's easily the most interesting hotel I've stayed at for a very long time.  Where else could you find a 60's style aluminum Christmas tree and open fireplace in the lobby?

The rooms are good sized and feature a king size platform bed and black leather chaise lounge.  The bed was a bit too soft for my taste, something my back did not appreciate.  The sliding glass doors, which open wide to create a great breezeway (vital in the warmer months) leads out to spacious balcony lounge.  Although the view from this particular room was that of an empty lot, the space itself is great and has decent privacy.  In a nod the the Mad Men-esque nature of this hotel, there is a martini mixing station next to the TV.  Fully stocked mini bar, single serving coffee machine and flat screen TV round out the in-room amenities. 

The bathroom features separate shower and bath, the latter being wide and deep which is perfect for me (I'm 6'2\").  Although there isn't a door to the bathroom area (the toilet, however, has a pocket door), frosted glass separating the rooms offers some level privacy.  The rooms here (particularly the ones with the Phillipe Starck bathtub literally in the middle) are not designed for people who are bashful.

Although a bit chilly while I was there, I did hang out at the pool for a bit.  It's an expansive area with two hot tubs and a waterfall \"grotto\".  There is also a poolside bar serving all the usual suspects.  The Mai Tai was overly sweet (go to Trader Vic's for a correctly made one), but the John Daly (think Arnold Palmer--lemonade and iced tea--spiked with vodka) is fantastic.

I did not eat at Cafe ZuZu, but the menu looked interesting and there seemed to be quite a few people there at both breakfast and lunch.

Valet parking is a bit of a ripoff at $14 per night.  You are better served either finding street parking on Main or using the the lot near the on-property Trader Vic's.

If I ever find myself in the greater Phoenix area, I will definitely come back to the Valley Ho."}
{"text":"Yes, the Valley Ho is as retro cool as ever. And a good thing, too, since I had to convince my boyfriend to stay here.

He, like Donald S., loved how we felt we'd stepped out of the WABAC Machine into the 1960s--only I'm not sure if he thought he was Sherman or Mr. Peabody.

Service was smooth from the moment the valets opened our doors, at registration, and as we were shown to our room in one of the outer buildings. The studio guest room was crazy cool, with a Philippe Starck bathtub in the center and a martini-making station prepped for cocktail hour. I especially enjoyed the private patio that overlooked a peaceful greenspace surrounded by orange trees and tropical plants, and I spent a lot of time lounging on the double chaise.

For a holiday weekend, the property was surprisingly quiet, so my boyfriend and I spent a lot of time soaking in the atmosphere and relaxing in our room. When our friends visited, we explored the rest of the property, including the spa, gym, and, of most importance to him, the lounge. There are several seating areas, including by the fireplace off the lobby; the small, sunny courtyard near the entrance; and the lounge proper, with the bar. All are great places to hang out with friends and have a drink while listening to Frank crooning in the background.

Overall we loved our stay and rolled with a few minor issues. There were some lackadaisical gaffes made by housekeeping, but we also loved how quick the front desk was in removing an overcharge for valet service without question. But, having stayed here when there were more guests, I know this place can get a little rowdy, even though it wasn't our experience this time. However, on the Saturday night we were there, we were kept up by the live music carrying over from Trader Vic's just across the parking lot. If you are sensitive to noise at all, you should probably ask for an upper-floor room (rooms are not carpeted) and think about staying in the main building.

Too soon, after a wonderful Sunday brunch outdoors at the hotel's Cafe ZuZu, it was time to go. \"Sherman--umm, Kevin--let us tally-ho from the Valley Ho. Next stop: North Scottsdale.\""}
{"text":"I was recently hosting a business meeting in town and needed to find a hotel for a few clients.  I selected the Valley Ho because of the location and atmosphere.  I've stayed there myself before and thought it would be a good choice.  
Overall, I was very disappointed with the Valley Ho and their staff this time.  Lots of issues, followed by apologies, and then no resolution to the issues.  Ranging from reservations, to charging the right credit card, to the restaurant and the staff.  To cap it all off, their email to solicit feedback took me to their own website, and the link to provide feedback didn't work!!
Disappointing..."}
{"text":"Wow this was a pampered weekend. I would recommend going to this place just for fun. I went with my wife for a weekend of...hmmm... and loved it.. so different and new and fresh. Staff is nice, rooms are clean, bathrooms are gorgeous...

a little pricey but you DO get what you pay for

loved it

Have fun"}
{"text":"Besides the spa being a bad experience with their front desk staff ... The hotel itself is FAB!!! 

Excellent, polished customer service from curbside in! 

Clean, open spaced, clever modern design. I didn't realize it's actually only two floors. The larger building is privately owned. 

Great pool...Awesome location... 

5 stars!"}
{"text":"This retro hotel is amazing. The staff at the hotel and cafe ZuZu are friendly and very helpful. The GM Heather is constantly checking to make sure everything is wonderful! The pool and staff are very attentive! It's now my home in Scottsdale! Patrick is an amazing restaurant manager and Virg rocks the bar!"}
{"text":"Our non-profit nursing organization, Arizona Perianesthesia Nurses' Assoc. (AzPANA) just held our summer conference at the Hotel Valley Ho on June 3-4, 2011.  I received nothing but positive feedback from our membership!  The staff was fantastic and anticipated our needs before we asked.  The meeting rooms were comfortable.  I was especially impressed by the accommodations--the retro decor was upbeat and different and the room was spotless as if I was the first one to stay there!  We will definitely use this facility again!"}
{"text":"The customer service was amazing. This hotel is the best in Scottsdale. Very Retro with updated rooms, great pool and restaurants. I stayed here with my sisters bachelorette party and it was truly a weekend to be remembered."}
{"text":"what is it with me and pricey phoenix hotels? i swear i don't just give out fives willy nilly or do i have any particular adoration for phoenix.  (sorry phx.) 

I went to the Valley Ho on an amazing business trip that involved rock stars and the Oakland Athletics, which happen to be my favorite team. it was downright magical. 

the decor was fantastic, the rooms were huge, with huge tubs, a poolside patio and a comfy chaise lounge. the flatscreen TV had an iPod doc! yaaaaay! (why don't more hotels do this?) 

the pool was phenomenal. i sat around for days on couches drinking bloody mary's and frozen drinks. the lobby bar had a deadly but wonderful drink called the stardust. 

The trader vic's attached isn't so hot, but i generally liked all the food i got from the pool bar and the restaurant ZuZus. (room service too- they make their own english muffins!!!)

If i'm comparing it to the royal palms, the other phoenix resort i raved about, it's tough. Royal Palms is better for chilling and families; Valley Ho is better for singles. Royal Palms is your wedding; Valley Ho the bachelorette party. Valley Ho had better food and more style, but Royal Palms had a bit more to it and better service. Really, you can't go wrong with either. 

What is it about Phoenix hotels??? all i know is i am no longer groaning when i'm sent on a business trip there!"}
{"text":"My only complaint about the Hotel Valley Ho is that I spent just a single night there.

There are a lot of reasons to love this mid-century modern boutique hotel in downtown Scottsdale, here are a few of mine:

GYM The gym's open 24/7, perfect if you find yourself jet-lagged and in need of a run at 05:00AM. They stock the gym with spa water, towels and ear buds so you need only bring yourself.

RED FLOWER BATH AMENITIES I've loved this New York brand since I first discovered it at the Harmony Hotel in Costa Rica so I was excited to see that my room was stocked with their Icelandic moonflower scented soap, shampoo, conditioner and body wash.

BATHTUB After a 05:00AM run it's super nice to settle into a big bathtub (especially a fancy oval one designed by Philippe Starck) for a soak. My room came equipped with a huge tub in the middle of the room and from the moment I spotted it, I couldn't wait to jump in.

PARKING ATTENDANTS In the morning, as I waited for Gabi to fetch me, the parking attendants were super sweet and offered me water (which you should drink a lot of when in the dry desert). As I always say, it's the little things. . . 

If my travels ever take me back to the Phoenix area, I am definitely staying here."}
{"text":"A quiet but poppin' and trendy 5 star hotel. Interiors are modern and really well done. Everything about the Valley Ho is astounding and will probably blow your d*ck off. I f****** love this hotel and recommend it whenever I get the chance. It's a really swank place to have a vacation, stay cation or business stay (if you're swank enough)."}
{"text":"I love the Ho!!

This place reminds me of the Flinstones movie. I love the art deco feel, the pool party was fun. The room was adorable and the staff was great. All in all, the room was affordable and the style was kitchy and fun."}
{"text":"PJ, Anna, Travis and Lo are why I come here so much! Best in service and class, all around. Love Cafe ZuZu and the OH pool as well. Try the turkey BLT and Sonoran burger when your here and sit it at the bar! Total 60's throwback with a very modern feel."}
{"text":"Stayed here for the first time over Memorial Day weekend for my birthday. Love the swanky vibes of the place. The staff was was nice and willing to help with whatever we needed. Would definitely recommend this hotel to others."}
{"text":"Stayed there 3 nights as I was in Scottsdale for business.

1st issue: Parking situation. No easy way to park your car and go inside for registration. You have to valet park which sets you back $14. The only other way is to park at Trader Vic's down the street and drag all your luggage which in 120 deg weather is not the most pleasant thing to do.

Once you get passed this first hurdle, the inside is pretty nice looking, the rooms have cool colors, lighting etc no complaints there.

2nd issue: Internet will set you back $15 a day for a slow ass 3Mb which feels more like 128k and doesn't work half the time. Total rip-off!

3rd issue: PARTY HOTEL. Ok now this is annoying as hell! This place is actually NOT a hotel but a wannabe dance club. If you're in town for any sort of serious business, AVOID this place like the plague!! 
I was in town for a big network implementation and working from 8am til 11pm every day and let me you one thing: as soon as I got to the hotel you have nasty disgusting jungle/rap/boom boom wannabe music blasting (you can hear it a mile away) until midnight. After that while you're trying to relax and get some sleep, you have all the frat morons completely wasted screaming \"yo mofo this and yo mofo that\" until 2am every friggin' night which gets to be really effin annoying. Could not get one decent night of sleep while I was there. 

So in short if you're a frat boy or a hoop player in town to party and try to pickup on some slutty white girls this place is for you. If you're in town for business and need to get a good night of sleep without hearing \"mofo\" until 4am stay away."}
{"text":"When Valley Ho let Tim Brophy go the front desk dropped to zero customer service and they need to fire the current ladies that work at the front desk on the weekends. They are liars, rude, will rip you off, dishonest and horrible customer service! We had the worst experience possible a few weeks ago with the ladies at the front desk they lied to us right in our face like we are stupid and threw the room keys at us! So bad we will never go back to Valley Ho ever again. It's to bad because the property and rooms are beautiful and the pool and the pool staff are the best!! The pool is dynamic and the current DJ is fabulous and the rooms are beautiful. Those idiot ladies working the weekends are the losers as we are now going to Platinum Card Rated Saguaro Resort where the customer service is #1 A rated the front desk staff are nice and honest! Peace Out Losers!"}
{"text":"Going to the Valley Ho is like stepping into the coolest time warp imaginable.  Their attention to detail, the service and the sweet lounge music made this by far, the coolest hotel I have ever stayed in.  The room we had over looked the pool, was clean, well-sized and everything in it was super comfy. We happened to stay at a time where there were lots of business meetings going on, but that didn't seem to stop anybody from having a good time.  We missed out on Happy Hour, but everyone kept telling us how much fun it was and what great deals they had on drinks.  We did grab breakfast one morning at the hotel and it was fantastic.  Fresh-squeezed orange juice and stuffed french toast is never a bad way to start your day.
We tried taking pictures but they didn't do the hotel justice.  We just ended up getting the postcards.  :)"}
{"text":"I just want to update to say that since my review was posted i was contacted by someone at the Valley Ho who apologized for the misunderstanding and internal miscommunication about the pool guest policy and refunded my credit card the $25 extra guest charge, which posted to my card today.

I was incredibly surprised and impressed at this above and beyond showing of good faith on their behalf that I added a star to the review and will definitely consider going back.  Just wanted to make sure that was noted."}
{"text":"3.5 star if you don't include the restaurant ZuZu (if you do it's a 2.5). I don't typically stay at 250$ a night hotels so I am not weighing my rating based on the fact that I thought it wasn't worth 250$ a night (maybe similar priced hotels are equal to this one). I stayed here for business for 2 nights. What I liked: Nice beds, nice pillows, LCD TV, large bath, stand up shower with tall shower head (I'm 6'1\" so I am used to bending over to wash my hair), the setup was nice and everything was clean. The gym looked amazing (too bad I packed light and didn't bring my work out gear :( )What I didn't like: No cover sheets (only one for the mattress) so you only had a down comforter and I woke up sweaty a couple times. I ended up taking off the down comforter cover and using that. The room service took about 30-45 minutes for a burger (is that normal? Seemed long especially since the burger wasn't too impressive). The internet is HORRIBLY slow (50KBs max, just remembered that and almost wanted to knock down a star for it :P), but free. I kinda wished I could have payed for faster service. 

I didn't factor in the restaurant but it is total junk. The food tasted like Denny's but 2x the cost. First night it took forever for our food to come. My burger from room service (same kitchen staff) was bland. The room service menu had entrees that the restaurant didn't (The server explained because they change their menu's at different rates). You could order from either at the restaurant but it made it confusing in the restaurant since the room service seemed to have a bigger menu. The last day we opted for Jack in the Box breakfast over their breakfast, and I'm not particularly fond of Jack in the Box. 

Wouldn't mind staying there again for work but I wouldn't chose it personally (maybe at 100-150$ a night)"}
{"text":"Scottsdale, in Native American, translates to \"Land of fake boobs and day spas.\" You can find both at Hotel Valley Ho. But this review is only for the spa...

If you're looking for a expansive, over-the-top spa, complete with 4 dipping pools, 3 jacuzzis, 2 saunas, and an acre locker room, this isn't the place for you. But if you're looking for a low-key spa with friendly attendants, clean facilities, and a great deal then you should check this out this place.

Facilties: a smallish locker room, 2 showers, 2 full-bathrooms with vanity area, a steamroom, and waiting room. With any treatment of 1 hour or more, you get full access to the fitness room. Complimentary shampoo, conditioner, facewash, lotions are available in the locker room, along with disposable brushes, combs, and razors. While you wait, enjoy some lemon water or Forte tea.

Services: Massages, body treatments, and facials. I opted for the 90-minute Lomi Lomi which included a body scrub and massage.

Value: Comparable to other spas in the Valley. However, they currently have a coupon on their website that gives you $25 off any 60- or 90-minute treatment. They also accept Spa Finder certificates ($100 certificates available at Costco for $80). Combine these things and you can enjoy the 90-minutes of heaven for $160, (20% tip included).

Valet parking available ($12 for overnight guests, free for visitors)."}
{"text":"Picked this hotel because it was within walking distance of Old Scottsdale andpretty much easy access to anything else we wanted to get to.  The rooms are interesting because they aren't like your typical hotel room.  

Platform bed with a duvet but no top sheet, a long counter to put things on and one set of drawers to stow your stuff.  The closet has just a pull curtain on it but a safe and iron and ironing board (seriously? ironing clothes in all that heat????) And the bathrooms have this smoked glass on a sliding door as well as around the shower.

Ok if you like casting shadows but what the hey!  The shower is nice and big and the water pressure and temperature are great.  Just no place to prop your leg if you wish to shave.  If you get a room with a shower and tub the shower is smaller but that tub is great for soaking a weary body after a hike.  The patios and balconies are awesome because you have a table with chairs as well as this can fit two chaise lounger for sitting out and catching some rays or just chilling.

My only complaints were that there seemed to be only one ice machine and it was near the pool and on a weekend that was very busy they had part of the parking lot that was next to our building blocked off for some mustang and motorcycle storage/event.  Not cool for when you come back in late and have to park on the street!  

When we come back to Scottsdale we will keep this place high on our list of possible stays."}
{"text":"Hip hotel with very friendly staff.

Large pool that I'm sure is packed during warmer months. Be sure to request a room that doesn't face the pool to avoid the noise late into the night of people socializing in the hot tub.

Trader Vics restaurant, home of the mai-tai- is affiliated with the hotel and they made us a dinner reservation to celebrate a special event. Though the place was dead on a Friday night (seasonal resort), the joyful staff made up for the lack of vibe and the food was amazing!

The spa and gym are way above average. I had the gym all to myself one morning and they have new workout equipment to \"get it done!\" It also faces the pool so you can stare off at the bikini bods while burning those mai-tais on the treadmill!

It's also walking distance into old town Scottsdale and a 5 minute drive the the enormous Fashion Square mall!"}
{"text":"Valley Ho Pool hates fun and is in the midst of an identity crisis. More specifically they hate inflatable beach balls and phallic symbols, dancing, and bachelor/bachelorette parties. By \"they\" I mean, Valley Ho Pool security.

So why, you might ask yourself, would they would boast on their website that their pool was rated the Best Party Resort Pool if they don't actually allow fun to happen? That's precisely the question we asked them when we were kicked out of the pool along with two other bachelor/bachelorette parties in April. 

We were kicked out because its a \"family pool\". Lets see, what family pool has spectacular bar service, a DJ blasting party music, 20 and 30 somethings mingling and having a good time, and exceptional poolside bar service?  It was seriously NOT a family environment and I would have judged the crap out of anyone who brought their kids. 

We were kicked out because my friend had a bachelorette tiara with a veil and they said \"no decorations\". 

We were kicked out after spending thousands between the three parties who all had multiple cabanas and tons of food and alcohol. 

We were kicked out for dancing. No seriously security told people to stop dancing at one point.

They took someone's beach ball away. I guess beach balls are too crazy for the pool. haha

We were kicked out for hanging out with each other. Again, they seriously told us to stop hanging out together. haha ridiculous!

We were kicked out for a completely harmless ring toss set, and a really hilarious huge blow up penis.. haha okay maybe that was too much but it was hilarious to watch the group who brought it get into even more trouble and really funny to see how uncomfortable the security guards were. 

Anyway, my point is, the Valley Ho is a really awesome pool but it just doesn't want to be a party pool. Don't let the decor, the coolness, the music, or the alcohol fool you. They want you to be tame, and not that fun, so you might look into partying elsewhere, or else you risk their security guards shutting your fun down. 

Overall Experience at the pool which is the basis for this review: 2 stars
Drinks: 4 stars
Waitress: 5 stars --- Our waitress was awesome and super cool and thought the security was being super lame.
DJ: 3 stars
Food: 3 stars
Security: 1 star
Hotel rooms: 4 stars"}
{"text":"There is a meeting room in the back that I believe is called the Sands. It has parking and is a great space. We used it for a board retreat and I highly recommend it. It is modern. The AC worked great and I wasn't frozen out like I typically am. Restroom was lovely and had great soap and lotion. We catered from the hotel and the food was very good. They also did a happy hour reception for us with a generous pour of pinot noir and many tasty treats.  Seriously, this is a find if you need a space to hold a meeting. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Now I know why just about everyone I know that is visiting Old Town Scottsdale goes to the fun clubs and fun hotels and it appears that Hotel Valley HO is chasing away people faster than they are attracting them.  It's rather obvious business isn't good and the staff and service is why.  I would look at the W or Andaz  or a number of other places that don't have an attitude.  I was told, \"a hotel is for sleeping.\"  Is that right?  A Motel 6 is for sleeping and that's what the front desk is turning it into.  

We picked the Ho because they had a suite available.  I picked it and paid for it through hotels.com, where I am a Gold Member.  We were celebrating my wife's birthday and her recent cancer recovery.  We had a handful of friends come by to celebrate with us.  Never does it state it's policy on bringing alcohol, not purchased from them, to the room in any 
Expedia on-line booking site.  This is the so called resort that started the \"pool party\" and was known for years (and maybe they still are) for looking the other way as prostitutes walked the property and club.  They apparently saw that we were bringing liquor in with us.  About five minutes after we got to the room this young gal with black hair cut short in the back and with a  nasty and sour personality came banging on our door.

She said, \"this isn't a party hotel, hotels are for sleeping.  Didn't you read the policy when signing in?\"  She was meaning of course the paper that they put it front of you at check-in and say, \"initial here, and here and sign at the bottom.\"  She said \"you aren't allowed to have a party or get-together in our rooms. \"  Telling me this as she nods her head up and down like she's scolding a little kid.  I have been in 5 star resorts all over the world.  I've never been treated so rudely, ever.  I said we were celebrating this weekend some really great news.  She said, \"Only 4 people are aloud in your room, consider this your first warning.\"  Warning from what?  We just got to the room.  By the way this was a $400 a night suite and it's not that great.  A couple hours later she came banging on the door again and said someone complained of noise and we had to immediately leave the property.  Which was bull-*hit because we weren't blaring music, we weren't talking loud, we were having adult conversation, we were not playing beer pong and doing beer bongs.  She set out from the beginning that she didn't like my answers and was out to get us from the start.  That's the kind of sour personality, the first person your guests meet, that you have.  I will never go to the Valley Ho again and I wouldn't recommend it for any of my business associates, suppliers or anyone else."}
{"text":"My coworker and I wanted a quick weekend getaway so we booked a two night stay at Hotel Valley Ho. WHAT AN AMAZING HOTEL! From the moment I saw the website, I knew this hotel would be just what we needed. From the second we stepped out of the cab, it was a blissfully relaxing experience. I love all things retro and they spared no expense in creating the perfect mid-century, retro getaway. The staff is incredibly accommodating and helpful, and when we checked in a few hours early, they held our bags and allowed us to lay by the pool until our room was ready. 

We stayed Saturday through Monday, and were pleasantly surprised to find that they host a pool party on Saturday afternoons. We jumped right into the fun, ordering pitchers of drinks and mingling with other young vacationers. There were so many large groups celebrating birthdays, bachelorettes, etc. It was a super vibe, vivacious vibe. The pool area is gorgeous and clean, with enough lounge chairs for most people. They also have cabanas that you can rent for a larger group. 

Our room was bigger and better than we could have hoped for (at a very decent price!). We two large beds, a balcony, and a huge bathroom. It was so nice to have room for all of our unnecessary clothes and shoes that we packed. Our room was located in Wing 6, away from the main pool, so it was always quiet. 

The only time we left the pool area was to eat. The restaurant/bar Zuzu offered a wide variety of tasty food. On Sunday morning we indulged in the \"make your own\" Bloody Mary bar (so fun!). We were also able to order food poolside, although the options were limited. 

I honestly can't put into words how relaxing and fun my stay at Hotel Valley Ho was. It was one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had, and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. I plan on finding an excuse to stay there again in the near future."}
{"text":"CLEAN, BEAUTIFUL, QUIET and VERY FRIENDLY. I rarely give hotels high ratings, as there is always something significant that does not live up to my expectations, but the Valley Ho deserves this excellent review. 
We stayed in the Suite on the 6th wing for about $300 a night. B
The new renovations are of high quality fixtures, bathrooms, bedding, TV and flooring.  Even the sliding doors onto the balcony completely block out any sounds outside, even when staying near the pool with screaming children nearby.  
The staff is very friendly and do their best to address your concerns to your satisfaction.  There are pleasant people all throughout the property. 
Staying in hotels is rarely memorable to me as most of them fall short.  Most are not worth going back to.  I have a high threshold for good ratings on hotel reviews.  The Valley Ho certainly is one to return to."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this hotel.  This was my second time visiting and our expectations were exceeded in some areas. The front desk manager, RJ, was super helpful and very nice. The pool scene was fun and perfect for our bachelorette party activities! It's pretty loud once the DJ gets going, so I'm glad we stayed on the other side of the hotel or afternoon napping would have been impossible! The food at the restaurant was pretty good, especially the potatoes, and the waitress was super nice. She even swapped out my side of fruit when it came out all melons (not my favorite). The one complaint I had was with housekeeping. They didn't vacuum or replace dirty glasses, but instead just wiped them out (ew).  They rectified this by bringing us new stemware when we called to explain the situation. Over all, I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Stayed at the valley ho last weekend. Absolutely loved the property and rooms. The service was great as well. I will definitely stay there again.

{"text":"Hey Valley Ho, you have lots of history and the largest balconies of any hotel in your class. I had a great stay, but what's with the bartenders in the lobby bar?  Three of them walked past me without acknowledging my presence. After several minutes (it seemed like forever) I enjoyed a wonderful Arizona craft beer on tap. Maybe I caught them on a bad night?"}
{"text":"I LOVE this hotel so much. Total 70s vibe, tons of color, crazy furniture, great lobby, great pool, delicious room service, and great location. The room we stayed in had everything, it was like a little studio apartment. It had a kitchen, living room, wrap around patio, view of the pool, big screen tv that swivelled, comfy big bed, random books, boardgames, various mood lighting, washing machine & dryer (such a plus when you're traveling!!!), great shower, clean bathroom, dual sinks, separated toilet, but NO BATHTUB.

Such a great place to hangout and relax. We didn't have a lot of time here, but from what we did see, its totally \"groovy.\"

Didn't eat at their \"diner\" area towards the back, but we did have the room service, and all was tasty. There's a little sitting area before you approach the diner, and its so cozy and comfy - the sun hits right where its located. So nice....

Its far from fancy, and they get a thumbs up for being super creative with their decor. Lots of \"Hollywood\" history at this hotel, but far from any \"tabloid\" history - thankfully. :) 

We'll be back!

P.S. 
Do you remember Orange Julius? Well, they have something similar, called, \"HO-J!\" So fun and delicious...frothy orange juice, basically. Don't forget to order their tasty onion rings & truffle grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Retro-Fabulous. This was my second stay at the Valley Ho in the past year. I'm very satisfied with the large rooms, nice patios, good menu and lovely spa products (Iclandic Moon Flower!). 

I also thought the service was great. I love that they've managed to transform the ultra dated architecture into a hip place with throw-back charm."}
{"text":"Sometimes, I wish I could transport myself back to the 50's. Women were women. Men were men. Drinking vodka martini's at 2 pm was acceptable. 

I was able to go back in time while staying at the Hotel Valley Ho in Old Town Scottsdale. They took an old Howard Johnson, and completely revamped it with a great, 1950's theme. Totally retro chic. 

Rooms were very comfortable and well designed. I loved the mood lighting in the bathroom! The staff was extremely polite and accommodating...from the front desk to the room service. 

We didn't get to experience the pool, since Arizona was in a cold snap while we visited, but it looked nice, albeit, a bit small. The bar was great. I was actually quite impressed with the wine list, and the bartenders were very attentive. Room service was a little on the weak side, but that's really my only complaint.

So, the next time I'm in Arizona, and have a hankerin' for a cool, retro vibe, I will definitely book with the Hotel Valley Ho!"}
{"text":"Just finished a 2 day stay-cation at this hotel for a girls trip - we had a fantastic time! 

Staff: The gentlemen at the valet were quick and polite; we spent much of our time at the pool and every person was sweet and attentive. We were given an amenity at check in of a fresh fruit plate that was nice, unexpected touch. 

Room: everything as advertised. We were close to the pool, and had a lovely patio that was next to a grassy area with a fountain. Despite it being a holiday weekend, the room was very soundproof! There was definitely a difference from when we opened the back door versus when it was closed. 

Pool: Clean! Even when it was busy the staff was constantly checking in regarding drinks and refilling waters. Plenty of towels and it never felt overcrowded. At one point they ran out of a vodka that there was a special on; our server was sweet enough to help recommend an off menu drink so we could still enjoy the special. 

We did not try any food or spa services during this stay.

I was hesitant to try a stay-cation but I was not disappointed!! The price was fantastic and we were thoroughly relaxed by the end of the trip. We will return again!"}
{"text":"Talked to a financial controller (Chris) who, after discussing with Operations Management, refunded the charge. This should've been done and without multiple calls. However, Chris was very understanding."}
{"text":"I chose the Hotel Valley ho as our hotel for 3 nights during the time we got married. I wasn't able to use any other facilities other than the room itself and the pool, so this review reflects that. I chose a king cabana room, since I would be having my bridesmaids over to get ready, it was nice to have the added outdoor space so the room wouldn't be so crowded. I was disappointed that the room was not actually open to the pool - as it seemed to have been described on the website. We couldn't even go from our room to the pool via the patio because there was no way for us to lock to sliding door, so it almost seemed pointless in that aspect. While it was nice to lounge on our private patio, it was open to foot traffic between our rooms and the pool and it often felt awkward as many people walked through.

One of the main reasons I chose this hotel was the décor - we used some of the space for our wedding photos and was quite pleased with how they turned out!

Other than that, the room itself was beautiful and comfortable. We ordered room service twice, and each meal we had was delicious and fairly priced. The pool was nice and relaxing once we actually got there, and love that they have themed sessions, including live DJ sessions.

Overall, we enjoyed our time here, but if I were to stay again I wouldn't get a cabana king for the sole fact that it's a bit misleading."}
{"text":"I got married here a few years ago and I still hear about how great it was. I agree! Five star service all the way. We were married on the roof and had champagne and hors d' oeuvres there, then the reception downstairs, in a ballroom that had break-away doors, open to the spacious patio. Outside they had a bar and comfy couches for people to lounge and talk. Inside they arranged food stations instead of a buffet or a sit down dinner. This way there were no lines and people could custom order. There was a carving station with prime rib, a seafood station with tiger shrimp and scallops, then a pasta and salad bar station as well. The best wedding food I have ever had! The wedding coordinator Melanie was so great to work with, it was the least stressful thing I booked. If I could afford it I think I would book this place again, just to have another great party that I could have time to actually enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great spot... Spitting distance to the art district and old town. The property is immaculate.... Mid century modern design... My fav. The room is spacious and comfortable. Feels like old Hollywood/sunset Blvd.... A place u'd find the rat pack hanging out in the lounge."}
{"text":"The rooms are pretty small and furniture is kinda IKEAesque but the bathrooms are really nice and so are the grounds. It is an excellent central location too. 
Didn't get to ZuZu but it looks really nice. Pleasantly surprised by this hotel. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Everyone loves the 'Ho.  And why wouldnt we?  Past reviews say it all...

Valley Ho is a total scene.  If youre not comfortable with yourself, dont dare to venture here, youre bound to be slitting your wrists before happy hour.  Its my own insecurity that gives this place 4 of 5 stars I'm sure...  Beautiful people line this trendy pool--many Scottsdale residents in for birthday pool parties and a close-to-the-bar room to stumble home to.  

Rooms are spacious and modern, flat screen TVs, bold colors, very shiek.  We got food from whatever bar is at the hotel but were too drunk to remember eating or paying for it so I wont review that aspect.  Just know that munchies are available, plus drinks, although I'm not sure why you wouldnt bring your own.  A room poolside is definitely the way to go.  

Crunch out a few situps and jog over to the Valley Ho...hundreds of Ho-goers each weekend cant be wrong."}
{"text":"(This review is based on an informal walking tour of the property.  I did not spend the night or rent a hotel room.)

If you are a fan of the 50's, Frank Sinatra or George Jetson, Scottsdale has a hidden jewel for you.  While visiting the region a friend told me that he wanted to visit a hotel he had heard of.  Soon we were pulling up to valet and leaving the 21st century to venture back to a bygone era.

Hotel Valley Ho is a boutique hotel that made me remember my childhood.  From the furniture to the brick sided walls (with no windows on the entry side) it was a nostalgic walking tour that is sure to bring a smile to your face if you're over 40.  Located within walking distance of the myriad of Scottsdale shops it's a great location if you're looking for a hotel in the area. 

The property is pristine, clean and well taken care of.  What makes it different is the 1950's architecture that starts with the actual buildings and pervades every aspect of the hotel from the pool furniture, fireplaces, light fixtures to the art work and landscaping.  However, it's incorrect to get the impression that the property smells of forty year old cigars.  Everything is new and clean with modern tech and proper lighting.  I have included over 15 photos from my visit.

If you're tired of the Holiday Inn Express experience and looking for something different, definitely give the Valley Ho a shot.  I plan on staying here in the future and will update my review to reflect the actual accommodations."}
{"text":"Absolutly great hotel. I'm from nearby Tempe and I still stay here a few times a year. I get the suite with the tub and me and my girl have a great staycation. Summer time is my favorite. Pool is average. Best part is that its considered a adult hotel. No effen screaming kids in the pool. I highly recommend this hotel"}
{"text":"Stayed here one night while traveling to Phoenix for business.  What a cool hotel!  I've never stayed anywhere like this.

I didn't experience the 50's personally, but this place has really kept and captured that essence.  (And yes, it's been renovated.  This place was built in the 50's but it's not run down or anything like that.)

The room was nice, the pool looked great (never got to go...), the service was impeccable, the food at Zuzu was very good.  Old town Scottsdale is right around the corner, with great restaurants and bars.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Our favorite place away from home. We barely leave the hotel! We travel constantly for work and fun but we keep finding ourselves here. We love the King Tower Suite and are currently planning our 20 year anniversary there in October. It's relaxing and in a perfect location to go out! Great restaurants and entertainment."}
{"text":"nice, large rooms.  Great pool and helpful staff."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this property.  I've lived in northern Arizona for almost 30 years and stayed at scores of Scottsdale resorts over the years.  How this place was off my radar is beyond me.  I basically stumbled upon it while searching for something different and reasonable for a weekend getaway with my wife.

True to form, the Valley Ho is like stepping back in time - the 60's to be exact - mid century excitement, colors and glitz.  ZuZu's and the lounge are spectacular - both are electric and offer excellent people watching opportunities.   The people in attendance were well dressed for the most part, a pleasant departure from the typical flip flop tube top crowd.

Our room with 2 double beds (least expensive) was equally delightful - same deco, very clean and well appointed save for a coffee maker which is fine without.  It was quiet, comfortable and conveniently located near the quiet pool area.  We also had a semi private patio beyond the large dual sliding glass doors featuring a double wide upholstered chaise lounge.  Nice touch.

The main pool can get crowded as others have noted, even on a Sunday when you would expect more check outs than check ins.  My only gripe was the condition of the pool water which was very murky from crowds of sweaty, sun screened guests trying to stay cool in the oppressive Arizona summer heat.  The pool water was also very warm which I am sure doesn't help the water quality.

We eventually moved over to the very quiet and crystal clear alternate pool which is basically a lap pool with a round wading pool featuring a sparkling shooting fountain in the middle.  It was very relaxing and peaceful.  The main pool is pretty electric and noisy.  We were surprised at how many young people were guest here because there are so many modern trendy resorts around.

My wife and I can't wait to return here soon and hope for many more pleasant stays at this wonderful property."}
{"text":"this is a nice hotel that's located in a good spot in scottsdale as it is right by a stop for the free trolley which is decent but has some interesting drivers but i digress.  the lobby and the rest of interior has a very ultra contemporary feel to it.  the rooms are cool and the bathrooms are unique.  the pool area is really nice and the i don't if it was that particular day or not but the temperature was perfect.  the water was a bit salty but that's all good."}
{"text":"This place is \"GREAT\" it is the perfect getaway spot for a romantic weekend

The Valley Ho has all of the amenities that anyone could ask for, beautiful Pool and Jacuzzi which is surrounded by cabanas.

I am definitely looking forward to a longer stay next time."}
{"text":"Have you ever seen people on the rooftop of the Valley Ho? Wonder what it's like up there? Last night, I finally got to experience life up high and it's everything I imagined and more. The rooftop patio at the Valley Ho is everything you would think it is and more. The 360 degree views of the Valley at night are spectacular and there's enough room to have a good size party. It's now on my list to have my own party there one day."}
{"text":"Had a stay-cation for just a night on July 3rd.  Rented a cabana for the pool the next day.  Enjoyed our time except when the bill came for the cabana. I had a coupon for $20 off a cabana rental that was given to us at check in.  Pool manager came over and said we couldn't use it because they already had half off for the holiday special, which I had no idea we even got.  It was only $20 so not a big deal BUT I don't like when companies don't own their own mistakes and make it the customers problem.  If the coupon can't be used during your stay day, then don't hand them out at check in with absolutely no disclaimer on it, either.  Just irritating that they wouldn't own their own $20 mistake.  Also still waiting for the $200 hold to be released in addition to the random $53 added in that hold/charge...not sure what that was for.  Valet was $18."}
{"text":"The Hotel Valley Ho staff treats their guests like gold. I bought my boyfriend a \"Hotel Valley Ho\" t-shirt at the gift shop and needed to exchange for a different size before our early morning flight (before the store opened.)  RJ at the front desk made sure I got the correct size before we checked out.  It is hard to find people who work that hard just to make sure their guests leave happy."}
{"text":"Celebrated girlfriends birthday, last weeekend 7/14/12-7/16/12from making reservations to our stay, its defiantly is the place to be Our room was  perfect. I love the decor! .Molly who helped with reservation to Pete with pool and cabana.We enjoyed the restaurant and bar James, Kate,Ted ,Shawn and Holli, thanks so much for making it feel like we were in your home and welcome celebrating my girlfriends birthday, she was the ONLY ONE! .
We will be back !!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the coolest hotel I've stayed at in a long time.  My wife and I took a getaway for a couple of days after Christmas and loved every minute of it. 

The bed is The Most Comfortable Bed I Have Ever Slept In.  If you ask, they will give you the code to the bed and you can call and order your own.  The pillows, which are amazing, are sold in the Spa boutique, as are the duvets and duvet covers.

Everything is really clean and modern feeling, with cool retro decor everywhere.  This is not a La Quinta with funky chairs - this is a mid-century modern hotel through and through.  

Staff are very friendly and helpful.  

Happy hour at ZuZu's was great - delicious appetizers and good drinks.  When one app took a while the server took the charge off our bill without even asking us, which was nice of her.  

Negatives (minor): The shower head is the rainfall-type so it is hard to get shampoo out of your hair.  It feels nice, but I like some water pressure.  

Also, when you first pull up to the front door the super friendly valet will take your car and park it underground, but beware, the parking is $14 a night and there is a free, good-sized parking lot on the side of the hotel.  The valet won't tell you there are free options and we only found the free lot after exploring a bit.  It is on right side of the driveway as you approach the hotel.  There were lots of empty spaces when we were there.  I moved the car and told the front desk and they didn't charge us anything.  

Overall, an excellent hotel."}
{"text":"Great service and quality food. Got proposed to on the roof!!! Beautiful views of all of Phoenix!! Lounge has a very cool and laid back vibe.... everything from wings to filet mignon!!!"}
{"text":"we ended up here at the sunday pool party after a bike pub ride. i felt like i should be on reality tv. i should've done some bench presses, arm curls and gotten a new tattoo (and tan and teeth whitening and designer t-shirt and coifed hair and necklace bling and big sunglasses) before coming here. 

no, it was fun. of course it was full of rowdy and raw drunk biker folks so it wasn't as pretentious as i was expecting. although i did ask the bartender for a glass of water and he seemed a bit miffed that i wasn't buying another drink yet. 

the pool is very cool and the grounds surrounding the pool are very lush and tropical. the dj was playing some awesome music causing many a folk to break out in spontaneous white man dance moves. the free towels were great so we wouldn't have to be the only ghettos with our wal-mart towels. 

although the pool is nice, i was a bit skeptical about getting in with 100 or so other drunks seeing as how a pool with drunks only invites peeing to be had. but i'm sure usually, the water is clean.

if we were more swank, i'd love to come back. hit me up Kim K!"}
{"text":"Valley Ho is a gem located on the western edge of Old Town Scottsdale. The hotel was built in the 50's and has a cool vibe to it. Once inside, you will notice that they left the interior as it was when it opened, down to the couches, chairs, lights and even the fireplace. Find a table, get a chair and order one of their many fine cocktails. Then \"transport \" back in time and enjoy. 
While there we only had time for a cocktail before we had to go. The Bourbon Smash drink I had was excellent.
We plan to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Much better than I expected!  It's like the Jetsons moved to Sweden!  Updated and friendly.  Spa was just ok.  But restaurant is the bomb!"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated 25 years together and this was a first \"stay-cation\"  we have done......I always thought that term was cheesy........ until I tried it...... and liked it.
No drive time, has the full escape feel with the room, spa and pool.

We took a summer deal spectacular savings and got a room with a mountain view for $99 we loved it.  Love the retro feel and the full size fridge BONUS! Cold brews for the hubby and all my favorite foods made it an even sweeter for savings.

A big Nope.....to opening the tasty treats they provide (actually the prices for the food and candy they provide were not bad) what can I say I camp so......I'm frugal.  Would  recommend any Phoenician this place for a......can't say it......urrggg \"stay-cation\"."}
{"text":"My wife and I stayed here one night and we loved it. We stayed in the 'King Cabana' room. The design of the rooms and bathroom were awesome. The flat panel TVs were a nice touch, the beds were comfortable. The bathroom had a nice shower and a separate big tub to take a nice bath in. It is in a great location close to downtown Scottsdale and the mall. It is worth a stay if you are coming from out of town or if you taking a 'stay-cation'."}
{"text":"September 7, 2017 Honor Brewery Company did a keg tapping event to honor SSG. Darren Decker, my deceased husband. The event was amazing and Ryan, I believe a hotel manager, helped facilitate  my friends and family there for the event. This place was awesome! They did such a wonderful job to show how honored they were to be there for the event, and every staff member was  not only friendly, but they expressed to me and my family their graditude for his service and sacrifice. Please go visit Hotwl Vally Ho. And the retro look of the place adds to the  appeal."}
{"text":"Very fun and hip hotel. I had a great time, loved the bathtub in the living area. Pool was amazing (along with the drinks) and the food was good too! I stayed two nights and would recommend it. I would not suggest it if you're looking for a quiet get away as it seems to be popular with the younger crowd."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Drove up from Tucson for 4th of July weekend with some friends visiting from the east coast. We all loved it. The rooms were clean and spacious, the main pool was way too party-time for us but the second pool was relaxing and calm, and the history of the hotel was interesting and right up our alley. Also, loved that they provide Red Flower products in the rooms - an amazing vegan and cruelty-free line of  luxury beauty products. 

With all of those amazing attributes, the main thing that stood out for all of us was the service - fantastic staff. Everyone from the front desk to the bartenders to housekeepers were always smiling, always helpful, and just downright lovely. 

My only teeny tiny miniscule critique is that I wish Zuzu offered more vegan options. We tried the hummus on our first night as a snack and it was great but there weren't any entrée options that we could eat. We ended up going off property for every meal for 3 days, which wasn't the worst because there are so many great vegan restaurants in Phoenix but it would have been nice to have one or two meals in our rooms.  

We definitely plan on returning - this place is a gem!"}
{"text":"If you are looking to party with friends, I'm confident you will be better staying somewhere besides this place.   They have a strict \"no more than 2 people\" in any room so if you have friends over for a drink, forget about it.   They sent 3 \"management\" people to ask 4 people in a room to disperse at 10:00 pm.   They had absolutely zero tact and I cannot believe the rude skills these people possessed.   Save your money and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience at this hotel! Could not recommend more highly and I thought the price was very fair. Would love to go back someday."}
{"text":"I really enjoy meeting my girls in the lobby bar here to kick-off a night out on the town.  The decor is cool retro, the crowd is pretty laid back, and when I'm hungry Cafe ZuZu is a great choice. The crowd here always seems a little more mature than in other parts of old town (or maybe just less drunk) which I appreciate. The drinks are poured well and the ladies room has always been clean. The fireplace and fire pits outside are also cozy when the weather turns cool. 

My two stays here have been very good.  The pool can get crazy at times but I prefer off days when it's quieter.  The day beds are great and don't miss the hummus platter - it's a generous portion and very good!  The front desk staff is helpful and check-in/out is a breeze."}
{"text":"Checked into the hotel late at night and had warm welcoming and was treated like royalty. People smiling and accommodating our needs. We stayed for 4 nights and 5 days. ZUZU breakfast was awesome and great service. Inside the hotel and half patio. The rooms look just the pictures and big and spacious! The pool on the weekdays had a few children but they were not a problem and the weekend especially Saturday was a blast! Beautiful women waitressing the pool side and the pool side food was delicious! Always coming around to
Give you ice cold water bc it was HOT! For sure going back! Wish I never left"}
{"text":"I liked this hotel a lot.   The pool was fun,  rooms were clean,  food was real good.  There is only one area that is horrendous.   That is the front desk.  A couple things happened that seemed like extremely bad business.   

1).   My friend was significantly over charged.   Not sure if that was rectified

2).  I rented a car and the concierge was very nice and accommodating.   I returned the car to the hotel as was the stated procedure.  At the time the concierge was not there and I mentioned to the front desk where the car was in the lot (this was their procedure).    Now the valley Ho has a deal with a local enterprise  rental car company.  I'm sure if I call the main enterprise number, they have no idea about the local procedures of the valley Ho...   The woman at the front desk wanted no part of communicating to the local car place that the car was back in the lot.   The procedure from both enterprise and the hotel at the time of signing the contract stated to alert the hotel when the car was returned to the hotel and they will coordinate with enterprise on that particular time and the pickup.   Front staff could have cared less. 

3).  I requested a late check out from the hotel.   They say on the website that on Sunday's you can check out at 5pm for $50.    It's written right on the site.   So I go to the desk that Sunday and the guy at the front desk tried to shake me down for more money.   First $100.  Then $75 and then when I pointed out the website,  he made the fee what it should be.  $50.   By why hassle me???   This just puts a bad taste in my mouth with this hotel.    Like a scam

Other than that, I really liked everything else.  Food was fresh and good.   Loved the Bloody Mary and mimosa bar.  Loved the vibe, loved the pool party"}
{"text":"I am a business traveler, so I stay in many hotels annually.  This was the WORST hotel I've stayed in for years. 

First, the good part: The staff and the speed of room service were FABULOUS, and the little blue soap they give you is the nicest soap ever.  

Bad parts:  Cigarette burns in the dirty furniture; towels that can double as sandpaper; filthy cottage cheese ceiling; mostly ugly \"trying-too-hard\" decor (although that's personal taste); MOLD in the shower stall; a bathroom tub in the middle of the floor with leaky pipes; toothpaste pre-splattered on the mirror; sloppy paint job over some exposed cinder blocks.

Please note I got this room NOT by choice but through a last-minute reseller whose name is the opposite of \"cold\" plus the word \"wire\".  If I had paid more than a hundred twenty for it I would be livid.  Thank heavens I only had to stay there one night.

When I arrived, a huge loud wedding party was going on.  I asked the front desk to put me in a room far away from them.  How could he have known they'd be having brunch right above my head at the opposite end of the hotel at 8 AM the next morning?

And if you are also a single woman, the walk from the parking lot to your room will be long, dark and slightly scary. Ill lit. Confusing, even with a map.  So carry some pepper spray!

Somebody wrote about the \"Jetson's\" theme.  Yep, that's exactly what it looks like, just as old and just as trying to be futuristic hip."}
{"text":"The Valley Ho really needs to change it's name to \"Mad Men:The Experience\" because everything about this place is meticulously retro-chic and stylish to the max. Seriously come here if you want to channel Don Draper.
An enviable location in Scottsdale with Old Town Scottsdale's plethora of restaurants, bars and clubs at your doorstep. My generously sized Signature Tower room was comfortable and afforded magnificent views of The Valley and true to the rest of the hotel, stylish yet comfortable. The beds are like sleeping you on your own little slice of heaven. The bathroom with separate tub and shower was HUGE and had GREAT amenties (LOVE the Icelandic Moonflower products!) and the shower has a little ledge you can plant your bottom on whilst bathing in case you're a little tipsy and need stabilization.
The pool is a lively, thumping club by day with beautiful people enjoying all varieties of adult beverages. The pool closes at sunset so the crowd has just enough time to shower, change and then head to Old Town for the evening. The bar and lounge are a fun place to hang out and grab a bite and enjoy some cocktails all in the mid-century atmosphere.
The Valley Ho is a destination unto itself and attracts a youthful crowd in a stylish atmosphere that's not too pretentious. Definitely a one-of-a-kind experience for those who are sick and tired of drab accommodations with no personality."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale for business and stayed at Valley Ho for three nights. The room was very clean, the property was well maintained, design elements are great, and my check-in/check-out experiences were quick and easy. I'll definitely stay here again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Mid-century modern architecture with just the right amount of current updates - what's not to love? 

The only thing that could make the lobby, with its groovy lounges and fireplace that makes me nostalgic for my old Preway, more hip would be if they had handed us a cocktail at check-in. We stayed in a king room just off the pool, which featured a huge floating tub in the center of the room and a small patio. The decor features bright accents and retro furnishings, but you'll also find modern updates like USB outlets for charging your devices.There was a lively weekend pool scene, but it didn't disturb my peace and quiet. 

The location is within walking distance of a lot of good restaurants/shops/galleries, and the hotel bar has a cool see-and-be-seen vibe. Guests ran the entire age gamut but I did notice a lot of bachelorette and girlfriend-getaway groups. Would absolutely stay here again."}
{"text":"The hotel was adorable and charming.  Our room was great.  One of the nicest rooms I've ever stayed in.

That being said...

No free wifi.  Sorry, but that's tacky and petty.

We also had a slight plumbing problem.  Apparently when we were out to brunch, the maid reported it and did not inform us of her intention to resolve it.  Later, as we were napping (in our underwear), the maintenance guy unexpectedly entered our room twice to take a look.  Hours after the issue was resolved, the maid unexpectedly entered our room to \"fix the plumbing\" even though it had already been fixed.  3 unexpected visits within a few hours."}
{"text":"I've been a guest of the hotel and the restaurant many times.  This is a great place for a relaxed, retro experience."}
{"text":"Loved my room and everything was clean. I ordered room service twice and have to say the quality was good and price was decent. Every plant based meal was delicious and I'm so happy they have a menu to cater to my diet.
Great pool and enjoyed laying out on my private balcony.  Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Had fun. Nice appeal, pool was fun when not crowded. The bell man there was very friendly and informative... Go Tanner! And the other vallet man that took our car and greeted us was exceptionally nice to bad we forgot his name. Room was decent tub was fun and loaded with drinks getting charged or not who cares we had them when it was past 2 so yes big plus. Will come back and try it once more to decide if it will be our spot!!"}
{"text":"Best best best time !! We come here every 4th of July! The party by the pool is so much fun and service is fantastic! We love our chic modern room. Last time we were here we were upgraded to the most gorgeous suite I've ever been to. This place is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Went for Thanksgiving- it was great! 
I just moved here prior and it was a good way for my husband and I to have a Thanksgiving just the two of us. 
Food was great and the service was quick. 
Manager was friendly. Cool mid century vibe!"}
{"text":"I was originally attracted to this hotel based on its location within walking distance of many restaurants and shopping in Scottsdale. I settled for it because they do not charge a resort fee (a sneaky fee many properties in the area add to the price upon check-in, usually ranging from $10-30 on top of the advertised price, taxes, and fees). I was looking for a fun place with good food and weekend pool parties. I was hoping for a younger vibe (late 20s-30s), but also quiet at night. Hotel Valley Ho had everything I was looking for and more. The service was great when we arrived, the staff at the door helped us with our bags and opened the door for us on our way to the front desk. We were able to check in early (around 12:30pm) at no extra charge. The lobby and bar were gorgeous with plenty of comfortable seating. 

Most of my stay was absolutely great, with friendly service and amenities consistent with the price and hotel class. I have a few minor complaints, however. 

First, it was wonderful that we were helped getting our bags out of the car and treated with complimentary bottles of water and having the front doors opened for us. After check-in though, we were not helped with our bags and we had to open a heavy door (it was a pull, not a push) to get to the area where our room was located. Also, it was only one floor up, but it was inconvenient to not have an elevator or help with our bags going up the stairs to the 2nd level (especially in 100+ degree heat). I personally didn't even notice, but my fellow traveler felt annoyed so I felt it was worth mentioning. 

The room was very clean and the amount of towels and toiletries was generous. I wish that we were given two robes since we had two people in our room. We were provided two bars of soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, cotton swabs, round cotton pads, a shower cap, and bath salts (there was a soaking tub separate from the shower- a luxurious extra in the cheapest room level). I forgot my toothbrush and the front desk sent someone up with a toothbrush and cute tiny toothpaste very quickly after I called. There was a good amount of counter space and plenty of mirrors. Our toilet was a little funny, the flush handle was janky and it looked like the top didn't fit right? It worked though. The daybed on our balcony looked a little stained so that was a turnoff. 

The OH Pool was excellent, service went above and beyond, even if you didn't order drinks they would bring water and move umbrellas for you to get shade. It did get crowded during the party on Saturday and I thought it was supposed to be for hotel guests only but talking to some people it seemed like there were a lot of local college kids who weren't staying at the hotel which was a pet peeve for me. I could not find any signage for the Ohasis pool and when we asked the bartender he said \"Oh, it's just a lap pool\" but we wanted to check it out anyway. We went around in the late afternoon and there were cups littered all over and the menu said a $4 delivery charge would be added to any orders. 

I also couldn't find my way to the fitness center, I just ended up wandering up the stairs and past some offices to find it. It felt like I wasn't allowed to be up there. 

All in all, a wonderful stay and I would be happy to stay again. The tropical mojito at the pool was so good and the food at Zuzu was amazing!"}
{"text":"Maybe I've been watching too much AMC but Hotel Valley Ho made me feel like I was in an episode of Mad Men...and that's a good thing!

I was here for a couple of nights attending a work conference. I arrived a bit early before check-in  so I went for a quick bite inside the hotel restaurant. Although the burger was a bit on the pricy side, the ZuZu burger and fries were very tasty and started my experience at Hotel Valley Ho on the right foot.

After eating and strolling by the  surprising awesome pool scene, I checked into my room. The cool/hip rooms had a mix of modern amenities with throwback colors. There was a huge, deep tub I took advantage of on the first night. The separate stand-up shower was also spacious and very nice. The 2 queen bed were comfy and everything felt/appeared to be clean and well maintained.

For one of the conference mixers we were able to use the balcony terrace just before sunset. The views of the mountains and dessert were amazing with tons of photo ops. When it finally became dark the outdoor space was well lit and our conference patrons enjoyed drinks made by the friendly bartenders. The space was well kept and really worked well for our function. 

After a couple days at Hotel Valley Ho it was time to check out. Overall I had a great experience. From amenities to the friendly staff to the great retro design, Hotel Valley Ho really made the conference a great success. Not sure when I'll ever be back to Scottsdale but I'll have to come up with some excuse just so I can stay here again."}
{"text":"Such a cool property, tucked in the middle of Scottsdale.  It is amazing how they have preserved the mid-century modern feel, yet made it modern and comfortable for guests.  The staff is extremely helpful and nice.  Great people watching at the pool on Saturdays."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place, I have stayed a couple times and always have a blast! Very pricey in the spring training season but the weather is great. Local Restraunt's are unbelievable and everything is in walking distance. The concierge is great and always made sure the restraunt's took special care of us so you might want to talk to her! The only recommendation I can say is upgrade the beds, for the price you should get a bed to die for!"}
{"text":"Oh Valley Ho, you make me swoon. 

Your valet and concierge are very professional and nice. I don't get called Mr. often, but when I do, it's at Valley Ho. They are super helpful and pleasant. They add to the paradise of staying at the Ho. 

The lounge area at the entrance is also very nice. There is an outdoor seating area where you can hang by a fire. I took advantage of this multiple times. Valley has an amazing little bar/lounge area that is pretty swanky. Great for staying up late and hanging out but still being a 3 minute walk from your hotel bed. 

Staying here was so relaxing and comforting. Valley Ho's rooms are the perfect balance of boutique-trendy and luxury. They are very spacious, clean, and relaxing. 

My room had a pretty awesome bathroom. There was a bathtub and a shower (that were separate). I managed to find time to hang out in that bathtub...well worth it. The entire bathroom is rounded off with clouded glass. You can turn on blue ambiance lighting that makes the bathroom glow--pretty classy. 

I can't wait to go back to Valley Ho!"}
{"text":"It's time for an update as I recently had a sleep over / staycation at HVH, and I definitely need to bump up my previous review to five fabulous stars!

I spent the night here with one of my best friends, and we had an incredible time... not only was our room insane in a good way (full disclosure: we did get upgraded, so thank you to the powers that be for that), but the staff went above and beyond to treat us like VIPs.  The amenities were awesome too...

We spent some time at the spa and ate a couple of meals at Cafe ZuZu too... I also used the fitness room for a quick workout the next morning.  All of the above exceeded our expectations.  The only thing we didn't take advantage of was either of the beautiful pools.  (There will have to be a next time for that!)  Regardless, I can now see first hand why my colleagues that come to Arizona always request to stay at the Valley Ho.

If you're looking to stay at a really amazing hotel and you like the hip, retro vibe, you definitely can't go wrong at the Hotel Valley Ho!

Pro pampering tip: check out the VH spa specials... we took advantage of a Sunday Spa Party Package and each received 90 minutes of spa bliss (facial and foot reflexology) + a glass of wine for only $99 (regular price $190).

Whether I visit again as a guest or just visiting, I can't wait to return!"}

Today, it's a fun, funky, stylishly decorated hotel. Good location, excellent service, with great restaurants. I'd definitely recommend the Ho!"}

Who gave you that information?  I

{"text":"Dip me in honey and feed me to the lesbians.... at the fabulous hotel, of course....

Love the decor.
Adore the rooms.
Grateful for the simplistic gym.
Yummm-4-days....

Yaassss... I'm a fan."}
{"text":"What a great hotel in Phoenix!  It's got that fun 70's retro vibe. It makes a business trip feel not so business-y to stay here. Great lounge area, both inside and out. Delicious food at the restaurant, Zuzu. The room I was in was a beautiful suite complete with living room and kitchen. I would definitely recommend staying here if you are in town!"}
{"text":"Nice clean hotel but way to loud!. I stayed there for a month and never got a good night sleep. If it's not the dogs barking, are the people being loud in their balconies  or the self shutting doors that make a very loud noise every time someone goes into their room. Very annoying"}
{"text":"Two days? Too short! The Valley Ho is torture for the business traveler, and heaven for the leisure guest. With so many pools, sunny balconies in each room, a lively bar, and a glorious onslaught of mid-century furniture, it's the kind of place you want to stay and admire all day. 

Rooms are spacious with SO much counter space, and thoughtful design details like a rolling table & chair you can move around the room wherever you want to work (though, you should really be by the pool).  My bathroom had a big tub and mood lighting, along with Red Flower toiletries that smell like happiness. There's free wifi, fancy magazines, and a robe in each room. This room was bigger than most studios I've lived in, very luxurious.  

Valley Ho's claim to fame is the \"Mad Men\" vibe, and the photos will tell you all you need to know. From the funky architecture that they've embraced and made cool, to the retro furniture you're tempted to squeeze into your suitcase and take home, it feels like being on a 60s movie set, with nary a trace of boring corporate hotel knick-knacks. Staff was chill and friendly, though valet parking is the only option.

Boutiquey at it's best!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite hotels. All things being even (location, price, etc.), you can't beat this hotel. The customer service is excellent, they supplied us with a bowl and food for our dog. It's quiet and clean. Above all, it's got a great modern design."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Great vibe, I love how they have a relaxation pool and a party pool. It's laid out like it's own small village, and the staff are super nice and always seem happy to help with anything. Went to the spa and got a facial and reflexology and both were splendid! They were at 100% because of the WM Golf tournament here but the hotel seemed nice and quiet, not at all crazy and busy which was amazing. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Fun trendy hotel near Old Town Scottsdale! 

I purchased the Stay2Play package for the summer.  This included a $30 voucher for anything at the hotel, two free drinks, a free dessert, an amenity (they brought some fruit, espresso beans and pecans).  The package was just $139.  There were also discounts on the spa, but I didn't use this. 

The parking is free in a lot, or valet. 

The location is right near Old Town Scottsdale. You could walk to numerous places in Scottsdale or drive for a couple minutes.  

The room itself was trendy, clean and modern/retro.  The major complaint I have is that the A/C never cooled down. I woke up numerous times very sweaty and uncomfortable. I didn't feel like calling for service at 1:30 AM though.  The room included a stand up shower and a nice, deep tub.  Robe and smell-good toiletries included.  

The pool is like a big party pool with couples, bros, and ladies' nights all over. The servers at the pool are attentive and bring people ice water. One can order food and drinks at the pool. The music on Sunday afternoon was a fun mix of modern alternative and rap.  The next morning (Monday) was more like crappy top 40.  

The fitness center was one of the better hotel fitness rooms I've seen! This included two step mills, a spin class grade bike, several recumbent bikes, treadmills, plenty of weights, a Pilates reformer, and more!  Ice water, towels, and apples were included in the fitness center.  Headphones were also provided if you forget yours.  

The restaurant - Zuzu - is super tasty. I loved the meal there (that is a separate review)."}
{"text":"I have a standard rating system I use because I try to be fair, objective, consistent & sober when writing reviews (& I'm a geek at heart...).  For Valley Ho, I didn't even bother - it's 5/5 for me.

Firstly, thanks to some vehicle challenges, our stay stretched on from 1 night to 4 and the staff were absolutely awesome.  They made life easy for us and nothing was a problem.

Secondly, as a lover of Americana (especially travel related) I applaud anyone who makes the effort to preserve, rather than tearing down & throwing up a boring beige box.  We stayed in both their cheaper rooms & one of the nicer ones in the main building.  We were happy with the cleanliness, the service & the decor.

Thirdly the pool area was great and the pool party rocked.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"ok.. so the owner persuaded me to come back and try again and I did. This time we had a different room which came with a bathtub placed in the middle of the room with curtains that could be drawn around it. Very cool. There seemed to be quite a few events going on (wedding, reception, etc) simultaneously but it was still relatively quiet. Nothing like the ridiculousness I had experienced Labor day weekend.  This time it was a completely different vibe..a good vibe. I would definitely stay again and recommend to others..I just recommend you call first to find out what's going on that weekend (ex..pool party)so you know what to expect."}
{"text":"Maybe more a 3.75, but definitely better than a 3. Here are the pros - great rooms on an interesting property that is a walkable distance to Downtown Scottsdale and is much closer to the airport than other Scottsdale hotels. We come to Scottsdale for work meetings held out of hotels, so I have been to three hotels at least now in this manner. This wasn't the supreme loveliness that the other two were (maybe both Hyatts?) but it was a great room and super convenient.

When I arrived, the electricity was out. Some moron plowed into an electric pole and the whole block was out. Can't check in when that's going on, so I grabbed a drink at the bar. Some strawberry thing and it was actually quite good. There's tons of light in the lobby (which is a nice lobby/bar that is updated but still has that retro energy peeking out), so hanging out there was fine. When I got to my room, they had given me an upgrade for the wait and the room was awesome. I was in a building with inside doors (I personally think it's motel sketchiness to not have that, and some of the building are like that with the hallway out in the open like some $45 night motel. Yuck. But my building was good, and outside my patio was the pool and groups of orange trees and lemon trees. Nice view!

Rooms (and patio) are great. Loved the mood lighting over the tub that shines through the frosted glass into the room, slept with it in on every night. Didn't use the tub, but it's big and cool and I wish I could have. Comfy bed, nice decor. The patio has awesome furniture and I couldn't help but take a chance to sit and read on the big lounger. Staff is super friendly and helpful. Food is pretty good (ate each day, as we had them bring in food to meetings). They even brought in chocolate and yogurt covered coffee beans and raisins for the person who booked the rooms (which I stole and ate and LOVED). Seating outside the bar was nice and it was good to sit at night and have some drinks. The ladies I was with really loved the bath products as well, which are available for sale up at the spa

Honestly, the con is just that parts of it feel more motel. Maybe that's the vintage feel, but some buildings don't have the same feel of the others. I can't sweat that since I had a good room, but my coworkers didn't all have that experience."}
{"text":"Hello happy Hotel Valley Ho! My lifelong favorite oasis in sunny Scottsdale, Arizona. The new Tower Suites are incredible and mod Zuzu restaurant never disappoints."}
{"text":"Had an enjoyable time at the Valley Ho.  As others have said, it's right out of Mad Men (but with modern technology,etc), and I happen to think that's a good thing.  Nice to see a hotel doing something different.  It's definitely retro swanky. I didn't get to experience the pool, but it looked new and really inviting.  

I'm mostly leaving a five star review for the amazing attention and help I received from Brad as I was checking out.  He was extremely kind, helpful, and is an asset to your hotel for sure.  Thank you Brad!"}
{"text":"Had our wedding there this month on the rooftop overlooking  camelback moutains The Valley Ho staff provided Superior Service our wedding coordinator Cassidy was the best!!!  She was always available for any of our needs. The day of the wedding went off without a hitch a lot of this was due to Cassidy's proactive planning and superb organizational skills.  The food service and bar staff we're very attentive to all of our guests needs they were always available for whatever we needed. They even notice that my wife didn't get to try some of the dishes available so they packed up to go variety of some for menu items and had it delivered to our room so we can have a snack later."}
{"text":"By far the best designed and themed Hotel I can think of. From Check in to Check out I was given the Valley Ho experience. I didn't leave the resort the entire first day just chilled by the pool and enjoyed scenery. The room is nice and the bed was comfortable. I will be coming back hopefully sooner than later."}
{"text":"If you walk into your hotel room and find a switch labeled \"MOOD\" just push it, no questions asked. 

Although the bed did not begin to rotate, the switch did set off some groovy purple spotlighting that trimmed the tub, and made the room feel jazzy. 

Overall, I loved my stay at Hotel Valley Ho. Despite my travels bringing me into town for work, it was so nice to come home in the evening to a property that made me feel like I was on vacation. Between the always social lounge and restaurant that is lobby adjacent, the two beautiful pools, and the spa on the property, it's not hard to understand why my palm tree adorn stay here felt novel for an East Coast gal. 

My room was also refreshingly spacious - the bathroom as well. It was nice to be able to sprawl out a bit during my three night stay. 

Additionally, pricing was very reasonable all things considered, so you get a little bang for your buck! Looking forward to my return in the future!"}
{"text":"I stayed at the HO for the first time and I loved every minute of it! I felt like every time I entered the hotel I was taken back to another era....the 60s. For some reason the Brady Bunch came to mind; I think it was the 60's modern lines and the use of rock walls, similar to the outside of the Brady Bunch house. Anyone that knows me, knows that I am all about modern design, so its obvious that I would love this place. Who ever remodeled this place really nailed the retro-modern vibe. Bravo!

Next: My room was fabulous! I think my heart skipped a few beats when I opened the door to my room. It was so rad! and HUGE. The amount of counter space was amazing. The bed was massive and super comfy, and I loved that the bathtub was set kind of in the middle of the room. If you're the shy type, fear not! There is a super cool massive curtain that you can release so that it blocks the entire bathtub/bathroom area from the room. Toilet area had its own door, as well as the shower. There was even blue \"mood\" lighting as option over the bath tub area. Too cool! I was solo on this trip, so I didn't make use of the bath tub or the cool mood lighting, but I hope to get the chance to in the future! The room was equipped with all the standard amenities. I wasn't a fan of the product line offered though. The scent gave me a headache, so next time I'll make sure to bring my own soap. Did I mention the room had a huge balcony? Well it did, and it was without question the biggest balcony I've ever had in a hotel. 

(The only downside was that I was in building 5 or 6 and it felt a little disconnected. Plus, I did not know there was no elevator in that building, so carrying all my luggage on my own made it a little difficult, but it's not a deal breaker)

I loved the design, I loved my room, I loved that the fitness center was open 24 hours a day, and I loved the service.

Although I stayed for 3 nights, I didn't dine at Cafe ZuZu, so I'll try to check it out next time. I did enjoy their delicious Espresso though! And it looks like they throw some fun parties out at the pool, and I may have heard about a fabulous  rooftop with fabulous views...which I will be sure to checkout on my next visit.

I look forward to more stays at the Valley Ho!"}
{"text":"We discovered the Hotel Valley Ho in 2007 when we traveled to the Valley of the Sun for an OSU bowl game. We are big fans of mid-century modern architecture, and the 50s and 60s in general. The Valley Ho is an old motor style lodge that was a Ramada for years where lots of celebrities stayed, and was the site of Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner's wedding. There is a lot of old memorabilia from the hotel in the hallway by the hotel spa.

The Valley Ho is a sprawling property with a tower and several other two story wings...the first time you stay you'll want to closely look at your property map or have someone walk you to your room! Everything is completely groovy in keeping with its mid-century roots. Lots of tiki touches are everywhere. There even used to be a Trader Vic's on site, but it closed several years ago. 

In the middle of all this is the round \"O\" pool, which is definitely a \"scene\" pool. I think it is open to non-hotel guests during weekdays and it can definitely get extremely loud, crowded, and if I'm honest - very low rent. Am I a snob? Sometimes I'm a snob. Apologies. I'm not sure why otherwise upscale hotels pursue these types of people for their pools, but alas many of them do. But don't let that scare you off - they have built a quiet pool elsewhere on the grounds with no DJs or bar (though you can still order drinks and food). It was definitely the missing piece this hotel needed, as I LOVE the property but not the Jersey Shore types that sometimes pack the main pool. Although generally if you go to the main pool early it's quiet as I assume these types are still sleeping it off. I really like the O pool but it's nice to have another pool to escape to if Snookie and The Situation start getting too rowdy. I recommend making sure there are no big pool parties planned before booking this property (unless that's your thing), but if you arrive to full-on thumping DJ music and hoards of Kardashian wanna-bes everywhere, do not panic. There are places you can go to escape. 

My favorite place to stay is the tower which overlooks the property. Rooms overlook either the pool or the stunning Arizona desert (go with the desert if you're old and cranky like me). The rooms in the various wings are decorated with lots of blues and greens, and the tower rooms have more earth tones and muted colors - it's like two hotels in one. I really like both the VH Spa and the onsite restaurant Cafe ZuZu. I always try to book a pedicure at the spa. ZuZu serves simple syrup instead of sugar with their tea (which my husband loves), which is just one example of the little unique touches you'll find all over the property. The lobby is spacious and colorful. They have a huge orange tinsel tree at Christmas - groovy, baby! 

One tip - the Valley Ho makes up the beds \"European\" style, so there is no top sheet. If you want a cover, but not a full-on duvet in the 117 degree Scottsdale summer, request a top sheet at check-in. You're welcome!

All in all, I really love this property. It's just so unique and groovy, like stepping back in time. There are always unique corners to explore no matter how many times you've stayed."}
{"text":"I love it when a hotel transports you to somewhere else within its walls regardless if you're in the city, out in the country, or in the arid, dry climate that is Arizona.

Hotel Valley Ho is 1960s-esque, mod vibe without being Austin Powers about it. I loved waiting in the reception area for our crew, feeling oh so hip in front of the fireplace.

The room...amazing. I felt like a mermaid princess. Why a mermaid? The color palette was blues and greens with a deep bathtub just for me! So much counter space for my myriad of products 'cause this girl DOES NOT travel light in the toiletries department. I had an amazing view of the larger pool on my private patio.

The grounds...like I mentioned, an oasis in this arid climate. Flowers everywhere attracting hummingbirds, no joke! Saw it with my own eyes. Two amazing pools. One for more of a scene crowd with tons of seating, cornhole to play, and just sparkling. The other pool is more to yourself and for laps but at night I saw a serious light show that I wish I could've captured!

I didn't get to try the spa or workout area, but did enjoy ZuZu, need to review*

 Though they had great amenities and services within the hotel, it was fairly easy to get out and enjoy Scottsdale walking or short cab rides.

Staff was amazing, and I would love to go back!"}
{"text":"I've never stayed here, but have been here several times for their pool parties and to have breakfast or lunch in their restaurant.  It's a pretty cool place that makes me feel like I'm in a hotel that was designed by a Rockabilly artist.  A quick breakdown of my visits:

+ The employees are really friendly.

+ Parking is tough, especially during pool party season.  I prefer to pay the extra for valet instead of driving in circles around the building trying to find a spot.

+ It's a nice spot for a business lunch or happy hour.  

+ The lobby lounge and bar is inviting and chic.  

+ We like to come here for breakfast during the summer weekends before we head out to the pool for their pool parties.

Return Factor - 70%"}
{"text":"Wow.  If I had to live in a hotel for a few weeks, I think Valley Ho would be my pick. I would love it if there were multiple Valley Ho-style hotels, but I guess that might dilute this place's unique charm. 

The awesome weather during my stay (sun! warmth!) didn't hurt, but I'm such a sucker for their design that I'd probably stay in a similarly designed hotel in Alaska.  Though, a tiki theme in Alaska would seem a little weird, I guess. 

The decor is based on mid-century modern style, since the 50s and 60s were the resort's heyday. With this in mind, the design of everything from the lobby chairs to the lighting is well thought-out -- balancing mid-century style with contemporary convenience (super large soaking tub, flat-screen TV, wifi). 

The decor is a little cartoony at times, but mostly the bright colors just come off as cheerful. A bit of a Technicolor touch is not necessarily a bad thing. There's a great tiki vibe, though sadly, I didn't get the chance to stop into Trader Vic's for a zombie (next time?).

The rooms are extremely spacious, and the beds are a dream -- instant Zzzzs. I love the patios adjoining some of the rooms. It was great to do some work on the laptop while laying back on chaise lounge. I did get a little bit of a vitamin D fix before I had to head back to gray ol' Michigan.  Like Andrea R., I stayed in building 5, but there were enough people around that it didn't really feel at all spooky to me. 

The staff was extremely helpful and kind, and the little Cafe ZuZu was perfect for breakfast and a few meetings. I loved the option of sitting outside underneath a giant orange umbrella. 

I hope that at some point I get to repeat my great experience at Hotel Valley Ho and add in a little trip to tiki-haven Trader Vic's."}
{"text":"I am writing this review for this past weekend. 8 girlfriends and I visited Hotel Valley Ho for the weekend to celebrate one of our friend's bachelorette weekend. 

The so-called negatives:

To begin, we stayed in the Tower Suite, which had one king size bed but was a bit misleading when we booked. There are 8 of us, and even though we knew there would be one bed, the photos online looked as though the chaise and couch could accomodate at least 5 people. It also appears as if there is another chaise, but there was only a small chair not suitable for sleeping. The website boasts that the room accomodates 8. We made it work because we are all close and don't mind sleeping 5 to a bed, but it definitely was not ideal and misleading. 

The pool on Saturday, which was a main reason we booked Valley Ho, is very different than other hotel pools and not in a good way. For one, most that I have been to allow the guest to bring in their own water or beverage and snacks. We were constantly reminded that our outside drinks needed to be finished, even though over half of our group were buying drinks and appetizers from the pool service bar. I understand the liability around this, however the staff was not friendly about it whatsoever. We were told to leave the pool area even though we were polite and obeying their rule, and many of us were ordering drinks. The security staff was downright rude. Terrible customer service. 

Perhaps the most disturbing part of our visit to the pool was that toward the end of the day, much of our group migrated up to the room. Two of us stayed back in the spa area, and left their belongings on the same chairs our group had been sitting at all day. When the two decided to leave, they returned to our area to discover that their belongings were no longer there. Someone at the front desk alerted them that they had been put into lost and found. The pool was not closed, the server that had been serving our group all day had simply dispersed of the items. This is a ridiculous way to treat your guest. The server didn't take the time to look around the pool area to see if the girls were still there - which they were, before deciding for herself to remove the belongings. 

The postives:
In the room, the bathroom was a perfect size and it was really nice to have the full kitchen and huge outdoor patio. The decor was also really stunning and definitely added some spunk to our weekend. Overall this is ideal for groups of friends or a couple who wants to splurge.

Valet staff was excellent - espcially Mike. He accomodated our group with every need.

Cafe ZuZu is great. 

Overall, not the worst experience ever - but we were expecting the same level of customer service that you would get at any other non-chain boutique resort and that just was not there."}
{"text":"We celebrated my 55th by doing it up at the Spa @ Valley Ho hotel and it was the best present I could have given myself!  I was treated like a king by Jennifer who is one of the best Masseuse imaginable and then Barri made my skin glow (& look decades younger!) thanks to her esthetician skillz. My partner in crime had the same experience (his great massage thanks to Kristin). Beyond the very nice and highly skilled team, this spa is great because it's luxe and low key. The fact that you can order from the terrific restaurant (incl adult bevs) seals the deal. Highly recommend Spa Valley Ho when it's time to rejuvenate or just time to forget the outside world. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Might be my favorite hotel anywhere.  Chic, retro decor and an amazing staff, soup to nuts.  Highly recommend the Valley Ho to anyone staying in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"What a joke of a security staff they have here. Everyone thinks they are something special, and their lack of professionalism and bad attitude is a complete letdown for an old establishment. I would NEVER return and suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"Love this place! We stayed here on Valentine's Day. We'd actually booked a room for that night at a different hotel but after a nightmare of them giving us the wrong room, arguing about it with us and then finally getting our money back and getting out of there it was Valley Ho to the rescue! We did wish we could have gotten an Executive Suite, but since there are only two and it was 5pm on Valentine's Day there obviously wasn't much left. Just got the basic King room, but everything here is always nice and clean. We love the property, the grounds are great. We've never stayed in the tower, but we really enjoy the vintage feel of the original buildings. They've done an amazing job with them and this place is kept up so nicely. LOVE the tubs and that they come with bath salts. We ordered room service and the lady who brought our food was incredibly friendly. Food was great. This is a boutique hotel done right and we will continue to come here on our staycations."}
{"text":"OMG, Can't wait to go back! I had one of the rooms with the soaking tub and I wanted to move into my room! Huge rooms, great spa-quality soaps and shampoos, Pod style coffee maker, Mini Bar, Martini shakers! comfortable bed, huge balcony with a double wide chaise, perfect on so many levels, Great Staff, waiters, great breakfasts! Pool, call ahead for spa treatments if staying over a SUday or midweek, they book up quickly! bath robes, great lighting, TV-which I could watch from anywhere in the room or laying in the tub!!! I would only ask for some extra outlets near the desk for laptops etc. so you don't have to get on your hands and knees to find. They did provide a long cord for me whan I asked. I really have no complaints, and for me that's rare, lol"}
{"text":"We were looking for a nice suite to have my husband's 40th birthday party. We called the Vally Ho, and told them what we were looking for, and why. We were shown around to the different suites, and decided to reserve the executive suite for the party. My husband called the hotel to ask about renting heaters for the enormous patio. At least 2 different people knew that we were having a party there with about 30 guests. At the time of check in, we were told that there is a \"no party policy\" and we had to sign a paper stating the same thing. At this point (1 hour before the party was scheduled to start) it was too late to change plans, so we signed it and went to the suite anyway. After having dinner for 22 people in their restaurant, we returned to the suite. At 9:00 on the dot security showed up and told us that someone had compained and that the party was over. 9:00 on a Saturday? Doubtful someone complained that early, but whatever. They \"encouraged\" us to go to their bar (so we could spend more money at their place). We ended up going to old town and had a great time, but we will NEVER stay here again. If they had been up front with us in the first place, we never would have booked a room here. If anyone has seen their executive suite, the ONLY reason to book that room is for a party. This is the most corrupt hotel out there. All they wanted was our money and didn't care about what we had to say. They had several opportunities to tell us about their policy, but chose not to until it was too late. Shame on you Valley Ho. We will be writing reviews on all of your social media sites to encourage people to look elsewhere for places to stay. FYI, Talking Stick resort has great suites, and WON'T kick you out for having a party there. Stay there instead."}
{"text":"Not enough stars for how I feel about this place.

Totally groovy, relaxing and fun! Yes, the DJ party on Saturday is loud, but you can request a room further away and not be bothered by the noise. 

I went to the party on both Saturday and Sunday. It reminded me of a Vegas or LA party, but everyone was having a good time and security was everywhere. They were also checking names to even get into the pool area. 

Bartenders were GREAT! I'm in my early 40s and even had fun. The crowd age varies, but more on the younger side. Made some friends there. Good times.

King studio room was great! So clean. I've actually never seen a room that clean, thanks to Elizabeth Montez.  Loved how it was decorated. The mini-bar and cool bar area tools were a plus. Loved how cold the room was and Red Flower products. I felt like was in a spa all weekend. 

Highly recommend. From the moment you walk in, to the moment you leave, you're treated well and made to feel special and the pricing is right on.

I will be back again."}
{"text":"I called the GM after I did not hear from him. He explained that the person I was dealing with at the front desk was new and that English was his second language so he did not understand what I was saying when I said \"bed bugs\". They said they did have an outside company come in to inspect the room (only after reading my review as the complaint was not documented) and they did not find bed bugs. They however would not share this report with me. They said if I would like to stay again they will make my stay more comfortable in the future. The GM said he would follow up with an e-mail but he never did. Not sure if I would take them up on the offer given the way things were handled. I also got food poisoning from the hotel bar from eating part of a raw burger before returning it. I had to go to urgent care after a week for antibiotics. Overall this place looks good, but all the experiences were bad. Whether or not they have bed bugs is still up in the air, but something definitely bit me multiple times as the photos do not lie."}
{"text":"I really loved this hotel.  If you like the whole rat pack/ vintage theme with a dash of class...this is all you.  Service was great, friendly, accommodating. Valet was awesome...quick, friendly, helpful.  When I stayed there they even had a Bloody Mary do it yourself table set up...do you even know how many different ways you can make a bloody mary...one word for you.. Salami.  It was just great, I was right at home, and the pool is a blast.

The place was clean...which is a must

Café ZuZu was the so cute, food was good, we ate there for breakfast.  My bloody mary from the bar was delicious.  

The bar also had a selection of cigars which was very convenient for my boyfriend.

What can I say...I'm in love...I'm a Valley Ho type of gal"}

{"text":"Amaze balls. 

Stayed here for my brothers 30th birthday and have been dying to go back every since. I love to retro vibes and the rat pack feel. It's classy and has one of the best brunch spots in the area. I had the eggs benny with a bloody on the side. So needed and made perfectly. 
The rooms are pure class and roomy. We have a room that over looked the pool area and loved the outside seating, even though it was 110. 

Please take me back!"}
{"text":"Seamless check-in by a cordial (though not overly friendly) front desk clerk...I arrived in the late evening after a long flight and rental car ordeal. She got the job done, but I really didn't feel all that special or welcomed....she explained none of the little coupon cards she gave me with my room key, and only told me about wifi when I asked.  She did mention that there were stairs...about 20 steps she said (I later counted and there are exactly 20 steps!). She tried to give directions via a paper map to self parking and then walking through outdoor hallways to my building, but of course, I got lost and just winged it...finally made it to my room on the 2nd floor overlooking the pool...nice!

Love the decor and vibe of the whole hotel...it's got the mod, mid-century feel but updated with modern bathrooms and air conditioning (thank goodness).

Positives- love the color accents of orange, turquoise and lime green. Also really liked the \"mood\" light near the bathtub...it made for a great nightlight that wasn't too harsh on sleepy eyes.  Love the balcony overlooking the pool. 
Negatives:Lots of little bugs flying around and landing on the white sheets...probably due to the balcony doors.  The room safe didn't work. There was no fridge, only the fridge with the items to be sold and an ice bucket."}
{"text":"Very interesting decorations. Beds are comfortable I love the fact that they have a huge loud fan over the toilet . Only issue no locks on the bathroom doors and no vending machine . So they try to force you to open those $4 water at night as you battle the heat. Cost of room is pretty high. I am here for a bachelor party and for this price you could get some thing nice in Vegas . I guess it's all location location location with so many things walking distance and mlb players staying here keeps the price high."}
{"text":"I don't have a bad thing to say about the Ho!  :)
We stayed here over Memorial Day weekend and had an absolute blast.  The mid-century modern decor is totally fun, the food/drinks are amazing, service is excellent, and the room was comfy and large with a huge patio.  
I wish I would have known about the rooftop patio before we came - we'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"The rooms are beautiful there, the service is excellent the pools are really nice only two cons!! 
1. The quantity of food at the Zuzu  restaurant is insufficient!!! The food is excellent just not enough for the price 2. 18.00 for parking overnight I have a problem with that!!"}
{"text":"My favorite hotel in Arizona. I love it here. Beautiful and very accommodating."}
{"text":"Boutique hotel with lots of positives.

I've been there several times over the last couple of months. I'm not a glutton for punishment but had business in Phoenix.
Honestly off season is a great time to check out the consistency of  service at resorts and restaurants.

The Valley Ho will not dissapoint.  Service is top notch.  The bedding and in room decor are kitchy without being cheesey. I especially like the Red Flower products and the bedding is verrry comfortable.

No spa or restaurant visit at the hotel for me but the fitness center is nice and the lobby is inviting for just hanging out.

How about complimentary wifi?  Ah, one day all hotels will have complimentary wifi.  Until then, no fifth star for you Valley Ho.

But you're close."}
{"text":"This response from the hotel is a joke. It's just full of pathetic excuses and it's laughable that so many things went wrong at this hotel that have NEVER happened at the hundreds of hotels I have previously stayed at. I'm done wasting my time with these jokers.  I am VERY happy to say that my brother's friend was going to book his wedding at Hotel Valley Ho (they are inviting over 100 people) but I easily talked him out of it after telling him about the horrific \"customer service\" we encountered."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous! Such a cheerful place with hip décor, delicious food and exceptional service. The rooms are impeccable. Every detail is top notch, including fixtures and amenities such as fully stocked mini bar, room service, toiletries, etc. The grounds are pristine- just like a movie set. I stay in first rate hotels every week, and this is my new favorite. I can't wait to return, and I will do so often."}
{"text":"Old Feel in modern day.  Hotel has been restored to the old look and feel and the building takes you back. Such a cool hip vibe.  Like old L.A. Or old Flamingo Las Vegas.  Nice pools to relax at.  Spa treatments are great!  Spa facility is basic."}
{"text":"I have been to the Valley Ho many times and confidently gave them a five star rating in the past. However, my last experience made me question whether I'll ever stay here again. I have waited some time to write this review because I don't want to write it out of resentment. So, here's to hoping I can be as objective as I can.

In past visits, I have witnessed many people having large paries here. Bachelor and bachelorette parties, birthday parties, weddings, and parties just for the fun of it. This hotel has a swanky, modern party flair. So when my husband's 30th birthday came up in February, I thought the Valley Ho would be a perfect place to host it. I called them about a month in advance and let them know that we were going to have his birthday party here and I rented out the most expensive room at the time (Tower Loft Suite, almost $600 with taxes). The person on the other line did not in any way tell me this isn't allowed. During the month leading up to the party, I made invitations, decorations, and spent hundreds of dollars between food and alcohol/mixers for classy drinks. We rented out the largest room to ensure that it would hold our guests (about 20 people) and I was very clear of our intentions when reserving the room. Fast forward to the day of the party. I was so excited because I had put more effort and time into this party than any I've ever hosted. The valets and bellhops were super nice and helpful. If I could still give them 5 stars, I would. However, when we approached the front desk, I was forced to sign a \"no party\" waiver. What. My heart dropped into my stomach and I went into panic mode. Since it was the day of, I was unable to get a refund. So there I was with a $600 room, car full of decorations and food, and according to this waiver, not allowed to have more than 4 people in this huge room at once. The group of friends that we invited are very tame, very respectful people. This wasn't going to be a party where people got trashed and created havoc, so I figured we would be quiet enough that we wouldn't bother our neighbors. You have to understand, I had no other choice here. I couldn't call off the party just hours before it started.

So fast forward to 10PM. Nobody is drunk, nobody is being obnoxious, the music is so quiet we could barely hear it, and everybody is behaving themselves like adults. Literally just mingling and talking with each other while a couple of the guys hung out on the balcony. There were maybe 13 people left at this point (I'm telling you, we're not party animals). Then there is a knock on the door and a man and woman in official uniform tell me I need to kick everyone out but 3 other people. Tears started welling up in my eyes and again, I began to panic. It was 10 PM. In downtown Scottsdale. At a supposed swanky party hotel. I was at a loss for words and was forced to sign another paper that said they'd kick us out if we didn't kick our guests out. They weren't friendly, helpful, or apologetic in any way. They shrugged me off when I asked about the other parties going on throughout the hotel. And then they left. When I went back in the room, I had to deliver the bad news to grown adults (some of which had traveled from over an hour away) that we had to move the party from the room to the bar downstairs (my idea to save face). It was humiliating, although our guests did sympathize with me after explaining the situation. We didn't order much at the bar, as we had unlimited drinks and food in the room and we were all pretty disappointed. The party died out pretty quick after that. Let the record show that not one of our guests went home drunk, and I am confident the outcome would have been the same had we stayed in the room.

It frustrates me because I was not warned that parties weren't allowed when I scheduled the reservation, especially since I told him we were going to have a party. However, I had seen several parties going on on the balconies the night of ours. And parties every other time I have ever stayed here. People were yelling and partying at 3 AM that night next door to us. I felt like the staff treated us like we were having a frat party, when in reality, we were very respectful and chose this particular hotel so we could have an upscale, classy party. That $600 could have easily gone toward a different venue that would have happily allowed us to have a classy party. 

I felt like this experience was so unfair, both to me who had put so much time, thought, effort, and money into it, and for my husband, who only turns 30 once. We were regulars here, but I don't think I'll ever come back after how we were treated."}
{"text":"This place could only be cooler if John Hamm (in all his Mad Man glory) was at the bar buying me delicious drinks. The minute you walk through the front door you are transported back in time. Back to a place where you would imagine ashtrays on the tables, people tanning with baby oil, and Heartbreak Hotel was making its way through the charts. This, my friends, is a thing of simple beauty.

The hotel is celebrating its 60th anniversary this year, having opened in December of 1956. Though it has changed hands several times since then, the vibe remains the same. The hotel has undergone an extensive renovation, yet has remained true to its roots in mid-century minimalism. The rooms are spacious and modern, with furniture that is both functional and cool. So often those two things don't go together, and you get a beautiful chair that bruises you when you sit in it to check your email. The bathtubs are marvelous. They are in the actual room, though there is a divider for those needing or wanting modesty. There is also a separate shower, of course. 

I did not have the opportunity to swim in the pool, but it is circular and is the central focus of the courtyard rooms. They serve food and apparently have the ability to make fancy coffee drinks poolside. I had a great view of it from the workout and spa area where I tried to burn off calories from the strawberry basil martini. The exercise facilities are not large, but have everything you would probably want or need. The spa is cute and has a small but fun store attached.

Finally, I feel the need to include Zuzu, the on site restaurant. The food was excellent, as was the room service. They will bring you hand-crafted cocktails to your room. Lots of them! They don't even seem judgy about it. They have a bloody mary bar/mimosa on the weekends, along with a delicious brunch. 

I would absolutely recommend Valley Ho and would gladly stay here again. It is not a big resort, so if that is what you are looking for maybe check out the Biltmore. It has a similar vibe but more property, etc. I knocked off a star because there was an obnoxious group of groomsmen staying in the rooms around us. They were unbelievably loud, which was a huge bummer because my friend was doing an Ironman in the morning and we really could have used a good night of sleep. The hotel didn't do anything about the noise, and the rooms definitely are not sound proof."}
{"text":"Yesterday my grand-daughter and I used a group-on that I had purchased for massages and use of pools, and exercise facilities.....it could not have been better!  We were treated like royalty, the massages(I had Jennifer, grand-daughter had Kristen) were fantastic....the best thing was how beautifully we were, some places are not as kind to group ons....not here! Thanks V-H, we will be back. Gloria Gardner

p.s. pool side lunch and service were great!"}
{"text":"If I moved away from Phoenix and came back to visit, I would definitely stay at The Ho. 

We stayed here on our wedding night and everything was fabulous. Some of our out-of-town guests also stayed here. We partied in the bar that night, had breakfast in the cafe the next morning, actually I had like five breakfasts that morning, trying to visit with all my guests before they left, every server I experienced was friendly and accommodating. I had the southwest eggs benedict and it was delicious.

We stayed two nights, so I spent both days by the pool, and I AM nice and tan now, thank you for asking. The Ho is within walking distance from Old Town where there are plenty of restaurants to choose from. We were able to come back from dinner and score the jacuzzi all to ourselves.

The grounds are beautifully decorated with flowers and contemporary couches and fountains about. The rooms are modern and funky and stocked with a nice brand of bathroom amenities. The only thing I had a problem with is the room we got faced outward and overlooked a dirt lot, felt like we were in a demilitarized zone when we sat on the balcony, but it did have a lovely lounge chair on it.

Overall we had a fantastic stay, maybe we will be back for our anniversary!"}
{"text":"I loved this hotel. It has great history and was recently remodeled. It's eclectic yet comfortable. The room was huge, the furniture absolutely funky! I stayed in a lot of hotels but have to say this is one of my favorites. 

Keep in mind that you have to give the car to the valley, you can't park yourself. So you should keep your singles for the tips. And you have the daily parking fee of $12 that they never tell you about until you get there. I wasn't excited about having to ask for the car every time on the way out."}
{"text":"The Hotel Valley Ho is a pretty sweet place to stay with a good location in Scottsdale, I've been here a few times and really like it, but it is not without a couple of quirks. 
   My second time here they tried to tell me they were \"valet only\", I knew this was a lie, but just told them I would figure it out, they are also kind of high strung about pool access, but you just need an ID and room key to get in. My only other particular problem is they have no wait staff at the bar area, at least not late, I've never been there before midnight, it's a minor thing but really, I don't want to walk to the bar every time I want a drink or some fries, I've had a hard night. 
   The good news is that the rooms are awesome, I love the modern/retro blend and think the big tubs with \"mood lighting\" and the ridiculous shower heads are amazing. The grounds are beautiful with bright green grass everywhere and the layout and design of most of the hotel are straight out of a Rat Pack how to book. The beds are super comfy and the original buildings have balconies with lounge chairs. 
   Even with some negatives, even with a valet staff that flat out lies to me, even with a fairly high price, I love coming here and look forward to every opportunity. Something about this place is so fantastic to me, if I figure out how to explain it I'll update my review, but with it's close proximity to all things Old Town and minute walk to the great Trader Vics, I hope I have a chance to stay here again soon."}
{"text":"Love this place and I visit every time I am in arizona. Great scene. Great drinks. This time I had their signature burger and it was to die for.  I also had their purple pina colada and it was a delight!! It's a must stop for drinks and food.  The hotel part looks pretty awesome too!!"}
{"text":"I am such a fan! Loved this retro piece of heaven. I've been to some of the most upscale places and modern ones galore. But for a nostalgia lover like me, this place was fantastic. I loved the 50s-60s music playing, the look and feel like you were stepping back in time, the modern touches (bathrooms etc) and the great food at Cafe Zuzu. Will definitely return. What a gem."}
{"text":"Nice little hidden gem nestled into the shell of an old HoJo out in the desert.
Totally swank interior bar/lounge area with a retro vibe.  Plenty of big fireplaces to cuddle around, heat lamps on the outside patio seating, and plenty of other nooks for canoodling.  I liked it a lot.
Way bigger than I had expected with several different room types, including condo residences.
The staff can be super slow to respond and calls may put you in to the endless loop of doom, but overall the sales & catering departments were great to work with and seemed genuinely happy to have the business.  Onsite, the staff was great too.
My meeting is being held in one of the condo units (held empty for such occasions), which is quirky and quite honestly that's why I picked it.  One can only tolerate so many cookie cutter hotel ball or board rooms before one wants to throw oneself out their sealed shut windows.
I would totally stay here myself, and would use them again for meetings."}
{"text":"We had a great stay here. The hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms were well designed with plenty of amenities. We enjoyed having an outdoor patio facing the pool. Also room service was amazing! They were super allergy friendly!! I would highly recommend this hotel."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stayed here for Spring Training in Peoria, AZ. It's about a thirty minute drive from Peoria but I chose to stay here because of the reviews on Yelp and I wanted to stay in a boutique hotel. We were so pleased with our decision to stay at the Hotel Valley Ho.
Right off the bat, we knew it was going to be a pleasant stay because making the reservation w/ Molly was so easy and painless. I was not on hold for too long, I wasn't transferred around, and she was personable and friendly. When we pulled up to the hotel, the first thing I thought was \"wow, these grounds are huge!\" The hotel itself is nicely wide spread but not too much where it's a pain to walk around. It's got a nice park feel to the outside of it so it's more of pleasant stroll to your room, from Café Zuzu or the parking lot or the lobby.
We stayed in the King Studio with the stand along tub, and OMG, I LOVE that room! I want a tub like that in my home one day! It was clean, the colors were nicely coordinated, and the room itself was pretty warm and comfortable. The only downer about the room I would have to say is the bed. I'm not sure if it was the excitement for Spring training or if we just missed our bed at home (we have been traveling for about four days at this point), but my boyfriend and I did not get the best night's sleep that night. This really was not too bad because we got up at 6am and worked out in the gorgeous gym they had. It overlooks the pool and we watched the sun rise as we ran on the treadmills. The gym was clean; they offered sanitized head phones (so convenient, I think) and there were towels on every cardio machine. Also, the lemon water was a nice touch as well.
We did not get a chance to visit the spa but we did peruse spa store and I scored the cutest salmon colored bikini for $10.00 (originally $115.00) so definitely stop in and check out the sale rack at the Spa!
Overall, I cannot wait to come back. We'll be staying here again for next year's spring training! Thank you Hotel Valley Ho!"}
{"text":"Price to performance is pretty stellar. For $110/night I enjoyed a large room with a luxurious bathroom, balcony, and cool retro furnishings. Service was decent, but the W Scottsdale is better on this front. Breakfast at their restaurant was basic but worked. Stylings from the lobby to the furniture in your room is really well done, the hotel has a great boutique-y vibe but without the pretentiousness. The location is good, only minutes from downtown Scottsdale. One snafu while I was there... I sent out some dry cleaning that was supposed to be back by 5:30pm, didn't happen. It was a stressful half hour before they found my stuff (all cleaned, phew!)."}
{"text":"The hotel itself is amazing. i wasn't there before the upgrades but the redesign is perfectly fitting with the architect. The rooms are georgous. 

The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. I need color copies printed and the front desk took care of me. 

It's close to everything in Scottsdale. I walked all over the main streets to restaurants, bars and art galleries. 

However, if you expect to spend time at the pool, be prepared to see what looks like spring break. They allow non-guests to pay a fee to spend the day at the pool and lots of locals take advantage of this. It's loud music, alcohol and definitely not the relaxing vacation i was looking for."}
{"text":"Just checked in today for a mini staycation.  Was SO excited!  Check-in was quick and pleasant.  Room is beautiful but has a VERY heavy smell of cleaning products.  Additionally, it's a cabana room overlooking the pool...or so I thought.  Our view is actually of a walkway, fence, and the back of the pool house.  You can see the tops of the lit palm trees though, which is pretty. Headed to the restaurant for dinner.  Asked for a quiet table.  Was put in a booth next to a party of 12+.  The booths...you cannot slide in them and get comfortable. \"Yes, the faux suede...you kinda stick to it I'm afraid.\" OK.  Ordered one drink and had to leave because this man at the next table in the large party was SCREAMING over everyone and gave both of us an instant migraine! (Not the hotel's fault, of course).  Got back to the room and ordered room service.  An hour later...nothing.  When I called to check on dinner, I was told \"Oh...I'm so sorry.  I forgot to put your order in with the kitchen.  It will be another 30 minutes or so.\"  Had I not called to check on it, the order never would have gone in.  So far, I'm sorry to say, it's been a real disappointment.  :(   UPDATE: Dinner finally arrived and was inedible.  The duck was really dry.  The pasta was underdone and chewy.  The Brussel sprouts were crazy salty.  The soup was all over the rim (they must have been racing to the room since it was so late). No spoon...husband had to slurp it with a straw!  Finally, we both put down our forks and said \"Let's just check out and go home.\"  Upon check out, I was told \"I'm sorry.  I can not refund your stay because you prepaid for today and tomorrow.\"  I said \"I've been here for two hours.\" They offered to upgrade to a suite and she was very nice about it.  But, we were just done and wanted to get out of there.  I'll have to call a manager tomorrow to discuss a refund."}
{"text":"My husband and I can't rave about this place enough. The rooms are beautiful and comfortable. The food is spectacular, the drinks, as well and the service can't be beat. We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"From the moment I drove into valet, the service has been ten stars! All employees very accommodating. SPA deep tissue massage by Wesley!
Lunch in ZuZu scrumptious !  Pool very nice, music very good!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Could be a nice-ish hotel with the design esthetic, but unfortunately it was a pretty odd experience.

Checked in for my fiancées business meeting on a Saturday at 3pm. Pool party raging with bad music and lots of 40 somethings. For hours it went on. And he was giving a presentation for work. Just seemed pretty weird. 

Was nice that it was walking distance to stuff. But returning at night there were some questionable people hanging around and local police. 

Specifically walked across the street to purchase my own water. Got charged for two imaginary bottles anyway! Robbed! Glad I didn't pay for this experience out of my own pocket."}
{"text":"Can I move in? Probably one of the greatest hotel stays to date!! Huge balcony and room, amazing bathroom products, fun pool, ZuZu, gym, spa and the staff is incredible!! Looking forward to my next stay at this amazing hotel."}
{"text":"Rooms are spacious!
Staff is very helpful and flexible!
Food is awesome!
Cocktail price is right!
Location is convenient walking distance from bars and restaurants!
Will come again!"}
{"text":"I was at the OH pool the other day for a promotion. The scene here is kinda insane... They need some better security by the pool. Pros are good drink prices, a lively scene, ample seating, friendly staff, and a decent facility considering the age of the hotel. It's obvious from the building the hotel is older but they do a nice job keeping it renovated. The pool is on the smaller side but nobody is here to swim just drink and party. There were definitely some people having a little too much fun and security could have done a better job monitoring people instead of just standing by the door. Some of the people who were having too much fun were annoying the staff behind the bar and getting in the way. I would attend this pool party if you are looking for a fun crazy time but not if you want to relax. Not saying it's a bad party it's just not for everyone!"}
{"text":"I can't imagine traveling back to Scottsdale and NOT staying at this Hotel. It is stylish, comfortable, immaculately clean and FUN.  I booked this hotel on a 'blind' recommendation and my expectations were more than met.  If you have the option to splurge and you love the pool scene, get a Cabana King right on the first floor with a pool view.  We got great sun all day whether we sat on our private patio or hit the pool, so it was great for a sun-deprived Chicagoan.  Even thought I don't tend to even like hanging out a a pool (not a fan of Vegas), I found this place relaxing, but lively enough to provide good people watching.  If we go back for Spring Training next year, we might try for one of the tower suites to get a different view but would be happy with many room choices."}
{"text":"This place was the best hotel experience I've had in YEARS. Check-in and vallet was helpful, friendly, and their food and coffee suggestions couldn't have been better. The room was GIGANTIC and so well done, beautiful porch, awesome pool. Adding this to my list of places I absolutely need to go back too!

Bathroom was huge and private with a separate shower and tub. Facilities were bet quiet, I'm guessing that it being not peak season helps a bit with this!

Tip - I saw this mentioned before but figured it was worth mentioning again, you can totally park offsite for free if you don't mind a little hike. It'll save you $18/night.

Favorites in town- fourtilfour coffee and Alo Cafe."}
{"text":"I wife and I stayed here in March 2018. We weren't really sure what to expect when we pick the hotel online but it turned out to be a great place! The rooms are beautiful, clean, renovated and with great shower! Our room had a balcony where we sat in the afternoons in the sun it was great. The hotel is close to almost anything you'd want to do in phoenix including Spring training baseball, shopping, the old town area which is just a short walk away and the botanic Garden. We will definitely stay here again on our next visit to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I could live here and be totally happy.  The staff was over the top friendly.  My room was huge, amazing, comfortable and oh-so-cool.  The glassed in bathroom and the blue mood lighting was the best.  Don't forget to check out the spa.  Ummmmm....  Love their signature scent too.  Check their store out online and get some shipped to you.  Thanks to this hotel, I didn't mind staying in a place that got up to 106 by midday!"}
{"text":"I'm having my wedding here so I thought it would be a good idea to check the place out beforehand by staying at the hotel. We had some friends in from out-of-town for July 4th so we stayed that night. We requested an early check-in for noon and went to the pool party which was so packed! There was a DJ playing music for most of the day and it was actually a good time. The food from Cafe ZuZu was so good! Defnitely a good place to stay if you can get a deal on the room!!"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to come here for a multi-day business meeting and loved it.  The room was large and comfortable and mine had a separate (deep!) bathtub and shower.  The first morning I woke up to some construction across the road at 6:30 am.  I called to change my room and got moved to the other side of campus and never heard it again.  

The pool was beautiful, and I loved the cushioned lounge chairs.  Every time I went to lie out, the pool bar guy came by with a glass of ice water.  I was a little disappointed with the temperature in the two hot tubs; both were barely hot and felt like bathwater after a couple of minutes.

I didn't eat at Zuzu's, but I did order the truffled grilled cheese sandwich with homemade fries from the pool menu, and it was soooooo delicious!  

Perhaps my favorite part of my stay were the two activities that accompanied the meeting dinners.  The first night there were a couple of massage chairs set out so that we could get free chair massages as well as hand treatments/massages!  The second night was a casino night with real blackjack/roulette/craps tables (although we didn't play for real money).  I thought it wouldn't be fun playing for fake money, but because it wasn't real, I decided to try the craps table and was able to learn a lot from the dealers."}
{"text":"The decor is not for everybody, I call it Jetson's meet Ian Schrager. Very convenient location for access to Scottsdale or Phoenix. I often walk to the local restaurants that I like (no DUI or photo ticket issues), Trader Vics is just next door if you are into that. Rooms are very roomy and clean. Spa and work out area are great. Very airy with adequate equipment. They run occasional specials for Spa treatments which I have taken advantage of making it very reasonable. Not crazy about the pool area but it is OK and haven't eaten at the hotel restaurant despite staying here several times. FWIW, I prefer the Valley Ho to the near by Kimpton which Yelpers seem to love (The Fire Sky)."}
{"text":"If ELVIS were alive he would LOVE the Valley Ho Hotel! Probably just as much as I do.  This is the ONLY hotel I stay at when I come to ARIZONA."}
{"text":"loved this hotel. So cute and has a great vibe. Service was excellent. We came here for girls weekend away and had a blast. Pretty close to the downtown area."}
{"text":"Love the Ho!! I love pretty much down the road from here and come summer I  do love a staycation son this is a great spot.

The staff is always helpful and courteous. Personally I like the wings away from the pool, it's much more peaceful. (That pools turns uber cheesy on weekends). If you have to be neat the big pool, I'd ask for a 2nd floor room since the room patios can often end up with stumbling drunk people .  ;)

The rooms are spacious, 60s  kitchsy,  great  amenities,  and I personally love the funky colored light bulbs above the crazy deep tub. 

There is a much smaller and quieter pool on grounds too and I love staying back there. 

I do love that they don t have a resort fee (biggest scam of hotels), but the fact that you have to pay for parking kinda sucks.

Be sure to head to Cafe Zuzu for happy hour 3-7 pm. .fantastic food and drink specials ranging from $5-$6"}
{"text":"Pretty decent hotel. Rooms are decent, lap pool was good, staff was pretty friendly. But for me the devils in the details.

They really need to rethink their parking situation.  They charge $15/day $17 when you add the parking tac in.  I stayed 4 nights so that's 60 dollars.  In a part of a city where parking isn't a premium it's a superfluous charge. There needs to be an option for self park. I was out in the morning and in at night and then typically back out for dinner. So that's about 3x a day. Normally if it was complimentary valet or one-time I'd tip 5$ per in/out.  Which is an additional $15 / day. So $120 to park over 4 days is absurd.  Since I was paying $15/day to park I didn't tip.  I felt a little bad because I wanted to but I was already paying $15 / day in a situation where I didn't think it was warranted.  Felt almost like extortion, given there was no other nearby option.

Ok, part two. They only supplied comforters as sheets.  I had to ask for a top sheet for my room. There are two issues with this.
1. Typically Duvets are made of a rougher material (less thread count) than sheets. So it's not as nice against your skin.  
2. Secondly, AZ is hot and in hot places people need more ways to accommodate various levels of body temperatures. Like only sleeping with a lighter top sheet.  In this instance you don't get that option.  You either have the comforter on/off or half off, etc.  Having the top sheet would allow people to have more finer control over their sleeping temperature regulation.

As I said those, these are minor, but are also easy to improve on."}
{"text":"Overall, this is probably the nicest hotel I have ever stayed at, and I want to stay there every time I go to Phoenix in the future.

When I first checked in, I had a little trouble finding my room, because I was distracted by how nice everything looked. I found my room on the second floor overlooking the brand new pool. 

The room was gigantic and it had pretty much every amenity I could want. The bed was huge, a wonderful tv, mood lighting over the bathtub, a private balcony, and so many pillows! 

Every aspect of my stay was beyond what I could have hoped for. Every employee was super nice and extremely helpful. I had a drink during the happy hour and a BLT by the pool. I really can't say enough nice things about this hotel. 

On my final morning, I tried having a massage in their spa. It was my first massage, and I wish I had known how nice they were. As I entered, I was given a tour and a fluffy, soft robe and flip flops. I can't remember what my masseuse's name was, but she was very nice and understanding as I had never had one before. She made sure I felt comfortable and relaxed to get the most out of my massage.

After my massage, I went and had a steam -- another thing I had never tried before. After my steam, I got to hang out pool-side until it was time to catch a cab back to airport. I was sad to see it go."}
{"text":"My fiancé proposed to me here last night and wow what amazing service! The entire staff went above and beyond! Thank you Judy in concierge for letting him sneak this past and help plan the night of my dreams! Thanks to the valet service for when we went to take our car to dinner and the tire was flat for changing our tire for us and even taking care of a ride to and from our evening plans! Room service was absolutely amazing and breakfast in bed was even better! Thank you for such amazing service for the best night of our lives!!!"}
{"text":"Hotel with so much potential but customer service is a major opportunity. Pre-booked adjoining suites for a girls weekend. A little booking snafu led to us needing to change rooms mid stay. Unfortunately, mistakes happen but the hotel wasn't very apologetic or helpful in moving our belongings. 

Rooms overall were great, clean, comfortable beds. Pool was really nice. Get there early when it's warm to secure your pool chairs! The pool staff was very helpful and fun. Food and drink prices were fair and food was pretty tasty. Biggest complaint from pool was unwillingness to accommodate special dietary needs inside the pool. 

Fine experience, but not extraordinary when it comes to service."}
{"text":"Got some extra cash (alot?) and wanna spoil yourself on a long spa weekend? This could be your place. The remodel of the original mid-century motel is really cool. It blends perfectly and seamlessly with the new residential tower, spa, restaurant and gym. 

The poolside service was absolutely top notch. They bring you a plastic tumbler of iced water almost immediately, I guess they know you will want this in the dry desert climate? Nice. They have a full bar poolside and full menu service. Again the service was awesome and the food/drinks were very good. 

Lots of cool shops and restaurants within walking distance. 

See the Valley Ho website for all the details."}
{"text":"Absolutely flawless visit. I'm really pissy about having to go back to reality today. Everything about our staycation here was wonderful. Easiest way to break down our stay is in highlights by category. 

The room: we stayed in the studio king. Loved the walk out patio and double lounger outside. The tub in the center of the room was a super fun bonus (and the water pressure and hot water were impressive!). There was a huge counter and vanity to hold our stuff while we unpacked. As you can guess, the decor was fabulous. Everything was clean and looked recently updated. This is a room you hate to get messy because it looks perfect! I was very impressed by how quiet the room was too - those old brick walls from the 50s block out a lot of sound. Only amenity we missed was a mini fridge. They have a drink cooler with items for sale in the room, but if you want something to store leftovers/your own drinks you need to rent one from the front desk.

Service: everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. At some point we mentioned our staycation was to celebrate a birthday - chocolate covered strawberries were brought to our room upon arrival and we got a treat at breakfast the next day. Both times the staff member had a candle and lighter for the snack, which was so thoughtful.  

Pool: we scouted out both pools and liked them both for different reasons. 
The main pool we visited on Saturday. Valley Ho has a great system in place where guests are checked into the pool and IDed/given 21+ wrists-bands so you don't have to keep pulling your ID out. There were plenty of seats (we wished we had been able to rent a daybed, but they were booked). The pool servers are actually attentive and it was nice to charge items to the room and not worry about cash. Food and drink choices were priced as you would expect for a place like this. Really awesome idea that most of the drinks can be ordered alone or as a pitcher. The DJ was decent and there was a good mix of young couples and families. It was fun but not out of control. 
On Sunday we went to the 'quiet pool'. It was not easy to find but it was certainly quiet. I liked this pool because it had a little wading pool that you can sit in and sunbathe without getting into deep water. But, no bar here.

Food: we ate at Zuzu for breakfast and ordered room service a few times. Room service was a tad slow but the food was warm and delicious. We enjoyed all our meals here, no matter where they came from.

Parking and transport: it's $18 a night to have the valet park your car. It was also super easy to find an Uber and go drinking in old town for a quick $5 ride. The Scottsdale golf carts were zooming around too.

Basically - I recommend Valley Ho to anyone and am going to be eternally sad that I can't afford to live there full time like Eloise at the Plaza."}
{"text":"I enjoy the hotel valley ho. The aesthetics are great and I love their public spaces and especially their service.  That being said for the price paid I expected WAY more from their restaurant and spa.  The rooms are ok bit not good for a roommate situation as there is little privacy.  

The spa SUCKS.  The weekend douche bag clientele isn't that awesome either.  Front desk and bellhops are super awesome and their conference facilities are nice."}
{"text":"Yes, this hotel is really as great as they claim it to be! :) Super modern, hip, and stylish. Friendly customer service. Comfortable beds. Very clean rooms and clean property. Thick brick walls which keep your room very quiet from all of your neighbors! Top of the line amenities! Great workout gym and pool. Upscale experience. We wouldn't think of staying anywhere else when coming to Phoenix. 

I noticed a complaint about the loud partying at the pool... yes, they do throw very loud pool parties during the afternoons, but the parties wrap up many hours before bedtime. So this might actually be a problem if you're looking for an afternoon nap, but would not be a problem for sleeping at night."}
{"text":"Used to stay at the Valley Ho years ago and had the opportunity to stay there again.  The Valley Ho surpassed my expectations.  Loved the look and feel.  Customer service outstanding.  Room was lovely. Pool was fabulous.  Great bar, delicious and reasonable breakfast on the patio.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Had a staycation here recently and it was so much fun! The hotel has great amenities and a great location. The rooms were super clean and modern while still having an amazing mid century feel. Room service wasn't too bad of a price and the pool was awesome. On Sunday's the bar at the pool has a bunch of $6 cocktails to choose from. My waitress kept me hydrated for hours. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My bridesmaids and I spent my bachelorette weekend here by the pool and were so happy. The hotel is clean and beautiful--the mid-century modern design is executed perfectly. The pools were great, with a relaxed but fun vibe and an awesome pool-bar happy hour. 

Down sides: slow service at Zuzu (the restaurant), and teeny beds. We got (or thought we got) a two-queen room and the beds were definitely full-sized. We tried ordering a rollaway but they said they can't do rollaways in the doubles rooms. The spa also left a bit to be desired--pretty small and not very upscale-feeling--but our massages were still pretty good."}
{"text":"Imagine Marilyn Monroe lounging in one of the cabanas, Bogie lighting up a cigarette in the lobby... and then me and my boyfriend on vacation, 50 years later, at the same hotel. 

We got a good car-hotel deal on Orbitz for a three-night stay here and it was totally the right choice. Most of the time, I don't care where I sleep because I'm out and about when on vacation. This time, we were relatively budgeted, but the hotel was a splurge knowing that we would actually be spending time there since we had literally planned nothing except relaxing and eating.

From the outside, it looks as if nothing has changed at the Hotel Valley Ho, but inside, it is all tastefully re-swanked in modern mod design. Everything from the bathrooms to the lobby has a unique character that wouldn't work just anywhere. 

Parking is easy enough on the other side of the building, though the actual rooms are pretty spread out and there are no elevators for the lower level rooms. They seemed to have ample valets if you want to go that route. We didn't try Cafe ZuZu, but the pool was lovely. They provide towels and bring you ice water the minute you sit down. They also have a bunch of fire bowls scattered around the outdoor areas to warm up next to. We had a nice time out there one afternoon/evening. 

The location probably couldn't be better either. I don't know Scottsdale very well, but it seems to be right on the edge of Old Town (on the Art Walk), so it's good for visitors. We explored that area a bit, but it's better for people looking to drop some cash on art and souvenirs. It's also walking distance from 5th street and fashion square, where you can find more restaurants and shops.

Our last night, they were setting up a fashion show in the pool area, and they must host large-scale events like this on a regular basis. We peeked at a beautiful outdoor courtyard and ballroom spaces that looked versatile.

And one more thing---the beds are comfy!"}
{"text":"I love coming here in the summer to the pool. My friend had her birthday here we had a cabana and it was a blast. I've also come to Arizona cocktail week here and I plan to go every year. It's a nice trendy Hotel not too far from Old Town."}
{"text":"So just how great is this hotel?

1. I live about 5 miles south and I've booked 3 long weekends in the next couple months. Locals would call it a staycation, but because of the hotel's stylish rooms, close-to-everything location and top-notch service, it always feels like a dreamy out-of-town vacation.

2. As public relations professional, I'm often asked about my favorite spots to stay in Scottsdale. The Hotel Valley Ho is always my must-book recommendation. In fact, our entire staff stays here as a group a few times a year. 

3. It's the definition of fun, energetic hospitality. Pamper yourself with a bedside dinner, or meet new friends at the pool over cocktails. No matter where you are on the property, an upbeat hotel representative is there to make the stay uh-amazing. 

Always."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous stay ! Beautiful scenery, adult atmosphere , clean big room ! Fast room service. Outside my room was a relaxing garden area. Also a quite pool area for those who really want to relax ."}
{"text":"We coordinated a bachelorette party at the Hotel Valley Ho, and I could not recommend it more highly. We had a large group so we worked with the Group Sales team, and they were extremely efficient, organized, responsive and went above and beyond to make sure our needs were met in advance of our arrival. Once we actually arrived, the rest of the service was just as good. The hotel is very cool and definitely feels like a special destination.  I would highly recommend the Executive Suite if you are looking to do any entertaining during your stay. We used it for our lingerie shower and it was perfect. We rented pool cabanas both days and it made it so nice to have a place in the shade and a guaranteed seat. The staff at the pool were amazing and you never had to wait if you wanted to order another drink or food. The food was great, the atmosphere was fun and the service was top notch in all aspects of the hotel. ZuZu (restaurant) was great too! We will be back! Also - I agree with the other posts that say this is a great place for those in your 30s - it is a place you can have fun and not feel like old ladies! Its a more mature crowd but definitely a fun one!"}
{"text":"DISHONEST STAFF & TWO SEPARATE BUNGLED HOTEL EXPERIENCES

This was our second visit here as the staff bungled the first visit in July so horribly bad that we were offered to come back and stay again. Actually that's not really correct either as when we first stayed there we checked out after only being there for 2 1/2 hours and had paid and not been reimbursed. No call back from management. They sent an e-mail bot \"how was your stay?\" only THEN a manager calls. I told him (Robert) my wife wouldn't be interested in returning. He pleaded and said that he would personally assure a wonderful experience.

When I called to book, Robert did not return 3 calls that I had made requesting the room. Yes 3 calls. I then called the front desk asked the gal to book a room with the voucher tells me she has a room with two beds. I said that doesn't work for my wife and I. She then tells me one king is available but for like $35.00 more. So yes there was one available, they just want to extort some extra $. So I'm thinking, \"This place screwed up badly, begged us to come back and then wants to nickel and dime me for a king bed,\" 

On that note, integrity is very important to me and this hotel has a dishonest staff.  If one thing happens, well meh. 2 things happen its alarming. 3 and 4 things happen, well, I'm pissed off. The pool bartender was nice. I was given 3 rounds of drinks while seated there and he only charged for 1. Yea, I hear folks screaming, \"What are you complaining about?\" Well, it's dishonest and it's stealing. I don't like thieves and didn't ask for free drinks nor did I expect them. I never walk in to Macy's to buy a shirt and expect the clerk to give me a tie and belt for free do I? 

This experience really sucks because I really really wanted to like this place as I have a liking to mid-century kitschy cool design and this place fits that bill. Rooms are retro-eclectic and nice. I hurt my back prior to coming here and was rather annoyed that no one told us that there were no elevators so I had to lug luggage up stairs which irritated me. I understand it's an older building but staff should have said something prior. It is a LONG HAUL  from your room to go get ice. I also went to the restaurant to ask for a spoon as my wife had some Ben & Jerrys and the server was rude. Otherwise we checked out without incidence - I thought. 

My wife comes to me a couple days later and asks me what the $50.00 charge was. So I call the hotel to inquire Kristen told me I was charged for a bottle of Belvedere Vodka. I assured her that we did not drink it. She said it would be refunded. I told her I was disturbed that I was charged for this without asking and asked why and she said, \"Well obviously...somebody as in our minibar department went into your room or it was just a mistaken room number ...or anything could have happened. But we'll get it sorted out for you.\" I said, \"OK Please do\" and guessed that was the end of it.  I also wasn't very satisfied with the \"anything could have happened\" explanation. 

To me this is quite sneaky to charge a customer's credit card in this fashion without consent and explanation. It's not like they don't have my e-mail and/or phone number to inform me of the charge. That's dishonest. My guess would also be an integrity issue again with the Hotel Valley Ho staff for missing liquor. 

I was never reimbursed.  I call back AGAIN 3 weeks later and Brian said that he would take my name and number and call me back with information. The same Brian called me back a half hour later and abruptly asked, \"What was the issue?\" and in a somewhat curt tone. I explained the situation again and told him the charges were supposed to be reversed and weren't. He then said in a snarky fashion, \"Fine, if you didn't take it home with you then I'll reimburse it to your Visa.\" At this point I'm really angry as he said it in tone implying that I might be lying about it. Nice way to treat your customers. 

Well, guess what? Yea, Brian never reversed the charges. Twice they said they would reverse the charges and didn't; feels really dishonest at this point. It's only $50 bucks but to me it's the principle of the continued dishonesty and then having to spend 20 minutes more on the phone with my bank filing a \"charge dispute\" was time consuming and once again irritating. I have much better things to do then waste time with the Hotel Valley Ho's bungling."}
{"text":"I remember once upon a time when this place was the \"Ramada Valley Ho.\" My high school would hold it's \"Sweetheart Prom (Valentine's Day dance)\" here every year because the club that organized that dance didn't have any money and this was the cheapest place around. They were pretty desperate for business. 

I can't remember when the Valley Ho reopened (I wanna say though that my senior year Sweetheart Prom in '99 was pretty close to when the original incarnation of this place shut down), but it's now a swanky hotel, with a certain \"cool\" factor to it. 

Since it's reopened I don't know if I've really had a full Valley Ho experience, but I've experienced several facets of the place, and I've thoroughly enjoyed everything! I stayed there for a night while living in Scottsdale and loved the rooms & service. I've spent time at the pool, which is great for people watching! I went as a plus one to a friend of mine's company party here, which was great (cocktails on the rooftop is awesome!). 

When I was visiting Scottsdale recently I came here for a little bit to sit out by the patio near the pool and enjoyed a cocktail. 

The property is gorgeous & everyone who works here from the bottom, up (not that I know any of the \"ups\") seems nice and committed to great customer service. 

Oh...when we used to hold dances here, we had to call it the \"Ramada Valley INN,\" because my school thought HO sounded inappropriate :)"}
{"text":"BIG FAN!  My first experience in Scottsdale. First day pool party was off the hook :)  People were sooooo nice and very welcoming.  The service was great.  I did order room service and it arrived late so they didn't charge me for it.  Thank you for a fabulous time.  I recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good time.  The ambiance is a throwback to the 70's...super fun!"}
{"text":"As if the name alone doesn't pique your interest, one step inside certainly will do the trick! You know there's an old saying: What happens at the Ho stays at the Ho. Well not really, but if there ever was such a saying it wouldn't apply in this case because I want everyone to know of this hotel's greatness. 

So where to start is the question. I'm not quite sure where to begin. Perhaps with the retro chic hotel room decor? Or the gigantic basin bathtub (with mood lighting) in the center of the room? Or perhaps their dog-friendly accommodations? How about the amazingly comfortable beds? Or the private patio for each lower-level room? Or the swanky pool area with a DJ and full bar? This hotel is a must-stay if you're in the Scottsdale area. And if you are lucky enough to live nearby, a staycation might be in order for some pool relaxation and the restaurant alone. 

Aside from their super hospitable service, they've also got a pretty reasonably-priced and pretty delicious menu. All around, this place is 5-star worthy. From service to ambiance, food and their unique rooms, the Ho isn't short on personality, comfort and style!"}
{"text":"Loved this hotel!  Service was excellent from the bell station through check in and on to the restaurant and pool. Definitely a relaxed vibe surrounded by mid century modern decor. Had a room in the main area that looked out to front entrance. Room was spacious and had that indoor/outdoor feel since the balcony door opened almost all the way across. Loved the location to old town Scottsdale. You're able to walk or ride bikes to so many restaurants and shops. Pool area was also nice. Was worried the DJs would bring a \"Vegas style\" pool party but it was not that intense. Good music and great service out there too. Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Oh BTW, one thing that was totally sick for dinner was the home made Parkerhouse rolls. Seriously? Who does that any more? They were awesome!! Could have eaten 1/2 dozen'"}
{"text":"Hmm, depends on what you're looking for. This is a fun little hotel, but I can only recommend it for short trips. Though they bill themselves as an \"urban resort\", make no mistake that it's just an old courtyard motor inn with a tower tacked on that's been given a nifty retro makeover. If you've seen the TV show \"Mad Men\", it's exactly that kind of vibe.

Room design is spiffy and certainly gets you into that mid-century vibe [save for a spectacularly ugly light fixture hanging from the ceiling]. I chose a tower room since they're a little bigger, but I also got a chance to peek into a cabana room and they looked cool as well. The bathroom in my room was terrific, with the deepest hotel tub I think I've ever seen. There was also a wedge-shaped balcony with retro [natch] webbed chairs and table. If you stay in the tower, you have a choice of pool or Camelback views. Both would be nice, but the Camelback view is also the sunset side.

Food and drink here doesn't offer a lot of variety, but for what it is, it's serviceable. Again, though, I wouldn't want to spend more than a couple of days here unless I really planned on going out frequently. The Trader Vic's across the parking lot is fun kitsch, with deadly rum drinks and a nice bar menu. Café ZuZu in the main lobby has a killer burger and friendly staff. The staff in general is very friendly, but not necessarily polished. I had trouble finding an ice machine in the tower after going up and down the halls, so I called down to the front desk. A bubbly-voiced person told me there was a machine on every floor and \"I hope you find it!\" I later discovered that there was only one machine, and it was on the ground floor. 

The pool is nice, if small. There are plenty of lounge chairs and regular drink/food service. Didn't try the spa, so I can't report on that. There's really not much else in the way of activities unless you walk down into Old Town Scottsdale, which is close by. There is a handy Circle K right at the entrance to the property, which has a pretty extensive beer/wine/liquor/snack selection. 

In all, a very fun place--but I would use it as a short getaway or business-trip home base and save a resort vacation for Biltmore/Phoenician/Boulders, etc."}
{"text":"Really cool Hotel with Retro vibe. Great pool with lively atmosphere but wasn't too crazy for someone in their 40's. Good food at the hotel pool and restaurant. Close to Restaurants and Bars and the Arts District. Good size rooms. Very nice helpful staff (Valet guys, Front desk, Pool Staff, Lounge staff). Just wished we stayed longer as it was a quick trip. Definitely will be back as we've stayed at many places in Scottsdale however this was the most fun and more reasonably priced than some of the bigger resort type places. They also have free parking if you don't want to Valet and Valet is only 18 a day which is reasonable."}
{"text":"Best place to stay in Scottsdale.  Great staff, wonderful facilities, close to it all."}
{"text":"It's a great place in the valley for out of towners or us locals who want a staycation.  Fun retro decor with a nice pool to lounge at plus with Zuzu and Trader Vics you've got two great places to eat onsite and Old Town Scottsdale just blocks away for even more."}
{"text":"Easter weekend relaxation. Pool scene is hopping, here with kids and grandparents. Casual, great weather, amazing food. Cool vibe for sure. Beautiful hotel."}
{"text":"Love the pool and hot tub as I'm a local. Haven't stayed here but come here a lot in the spring and summertime! Love everyone who works here and I love the vibe here, it's so much more lowkey than the W or Maya pool parties, yet it still is SUPER fun with good music, CHEAPER (than W or Maya) drinks and food! Always good times at the Valley Ho!!"}
{"text":"All hotels have their flaws but the good definitely outweighed any bads I found. Of course, the first thing you notice is the decor. It's a fun, funky contemporary spin on the retro era that the hotel was originally built in. I personally really loved it. We had great service all around from checking in to Cafe Zuzu to the concierge and spa & pool staff. Everyone who worked there was really friendly, welcoming and helpful. The rooms were clean & spacious and I enjoyed having a private patio. I also appreciated the hotels efforts to go green. If you stay at the hotel, I suggest walking around the property. It's really quite pretty and we would have missed out had we not taken the tour to get the arts & cultural history of the hotel (Ace our tour guide rocked btw). We ate breakfast daily at Cafe Zuzu, we partook in the spa service (which was amazing- even if you dont book service as a guest you have access to the gym and sauna) and we also had a pool cabana rental. I was very impressed with the hotel and would recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in Scottsdale. It's in a great location- walking distance to Old Town and Downtown Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My husband and I stay at several hotels throughout the valley during the summer months and this is by far our favorite! This was out first time staying here and our entire visit was great. Catherine helped me book our room over the phone and she made sure we had the best room/view at a great price. We showed up Saturday morning around 10:30 and they let us check into our room then, and when I called to see if we could do a late check out on Sunday, they gave us until 1pm without a fee. We had a blast at both pools, both totally different experiences, but that's what was nice about it. The main pool had awesome drink specials ($6 Pina Coladas!) especially for a Saturday. Our room was on the bottom floor right off of the Oasis pool and we were able to walk right out to the water, that was a plus. I honestly think we'll stick to this hotel for the rest of our summer staycations."}
{"text":"Had such a good stay at the Valley Ho! Service is incredible at the pool bar.. Great young vibe. To end off our stay I got a massage at the spa ( awesome weekday specials ) Thank you Jenn for the most incredible massage Iv ever had! If I lived in Scottsdale I'd be here every week!"}
{"text":"I'd give it zero if that was an option.

I've stayed at 2 star hotels with better service. Aging place is not even close to worth the rates they charge. Stay away."}
{"text":"We stayed in their standard room and it was more than we could ask for. We planned for a relaxing staycation and were given exactly that. The room was spacious, the patio was large, and the natural light from the large patio was an added bonus. 

Room service was quick, the food was great, and the restaurant was okay. We got the salmon and the chicken dish. The salmon was good but the chicken has little to no flavor. The serving staff made up for the experience as they were very attentive and friendly.

The pool party was fun and the drinks were really good as well.

The only downfall was our last night there. Around 3am we had someone come banging on our door. He was banging so loudly that we were nervous to open the door and he kept yelling. He eventually started throwing up in front of our room and we figured he obviously had too much to drink. He woke us from our sleep and we couldn't get him away and had to call security."}
{"text":"We recently stayed there as a large group for our wedding. All of our guests loved the atmosphere and there stay. I was very impressed with the staff and the service we received the entire weekend. From the beginning with the planning with there corporate members for a Large room block, to booking a shuttle,  to checking in and out they where amazing. I also recommend the spa , Karen was my therapist and I can say it was one of the best massages I have ever had.  Perfect location especially for our out of town people and over all a great stay!"}
{"text":"I booked my room here based on a recommendation from a Scottish man I met recently in gay bar in Atlanta. None of that is relevant but it was the best piece of advice I received in a long time. 

When I entered my room, I thought I was given the wrong room number. I walked into a very clean, large, king-sized suite with a full kitchen, a huge bathroom, a beautiful patio overlooking the pool, beautiful artwork and even a washer/dryer AND a very nice cheese plate on the marble topped counter in the kitchen area. There was a really nice note for a \"Patty M.\" which is not me but I'm not going to complain that they got my name wrong (and I'm certainly not going to tell them that they put me in someone else's room). I was greeted warmly by the valet and the front desk attendant. The bath products are amazing and the best part is that the rates are really great for this area. Free Wi-Fi tops out my list. If you're here on business, stay at the Ho and hope they put you in the wrong room. I'm completely spoiled."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the Valley Ho! Tori B. had a post reception and stayed here after her wedding. We drank in the bar until closing and the bartenders were awesome, quick to take orders and very friendly. 

I love the open layout of the bar/dining/patio area. We had breakfast here the next morning and the sunlight pouring in the dining area really set the mood for a sunny and beautiful day. 

The food was good. I ordered the bowl of berries (blueberries, blackberries, cherries, raspberries, strawberries) and it was fresh and delicious. I was disappointed in the Croque Madame I ordered, I've had it several places (it is delicious at LGO) and it is one of my favorites. This one was not so good because it was COVERED in béchamel sauce and tasted like stale flour. Not their fault though, it stated it on the menu I just hadn't read it when ordering.

The rooms at the hotel are very spacious; I was impressed over the size of the bathrooms. The décor is very funky and the glass walls opening on to the balconies created the illusion of a lot of space. The complimentary breakfast bar included espresso and the soap and lotions (Red Flower) smelled like organic heaven.

The pool area has great cabanas and the atmosphere was different than many Scottsdale Hotels. There were a bunch of families and 20 somethings, but there weren't a lot of fake boobs/tans ect.. 

The Valley Ho provided a wonderful spot for a greet weekend. I may have to crash it again as the hot weather approaches."}
{"text":"This Boutique Hotel is one of our favorites in Scottsdale. It's clean, the staff is wonderful the food is amazing and the pool parties on a weekend are just what the doctor ordered. We've been coming here for a couple years now and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"My experience at Hotel Valley Ho was exceptional. I didn't stay overnight here but attended my niece's wedding. This hotel has been remodeled and is retro chic. Think \"Frank Sinatra\" era. The location is great as its centrally located in downtown Scottsdale. It's just a short walk from shops and restaurants in Old Town too. 

This wedding took place late February and after the ceremony the celebration started on the rooftop at Hotel Valley Ho. I wasn't sure what to expect but I have to say I was impressed with the set up. It was sunny and warm so there were umbrellas set up for shade and some casual seating (couches and small round tables and chairs) with 2 bars on either end. Simply lovely! With the hotel having 7 floors the views are quit incredible from the top. 

The remainder of the reception and dinner was held in their ballroom. But don't think typical ballroom here. The dinner and dancing area is covered but there are large glass doors that open up to the outside to another bar area. The food was delicious and perfectly prepared (for 150 people). Staff were attentive and this facility seemed like an excellent choice for the occasion."}
{"text":"This is a gorgeous hotel that is poorly managed and the pool staff is a complete joke in terms of customer service. Don't ruin the enjoyment of a fun town with a bad stay here, seriously."}
{"text":"This is a review update to say this place is as good as I remembered it 18 months later.  It has all the things that matter to me, the Valley Ho has: Clean (without the stink of detergents); very well appointed (understated, modern, simple, tasteful); friendly, professional staff (with only a very little snobbish, which I'll forgive since it's so much less than other nice hotels); great location; a pool you actually want to use; a good restaurant (a bit expensive but not outrageous); and pet-friendly to boot (without a lot of hassle -- they trust people to be responsible).  And good value.  I'd love to find places just like this all across the country."}
{"text":"I was only here for Cupcake Love In but the hotel looked beautiful. The space was a little cramped and the bar had this \"great\" deal for $5 of a build your own Bloody Mary bar. It was cool but if you don't have a lot of experience making Bloody Mary's and are probably hung over and just want to drink ie: Me, I would just have them make it. (It costs the same)"}
{"text":"Had a spa massage there.  It was great.  The facility is very nice and they had all the little extras too.  You get use of the pool and fitness center as well.  Great food by the pool and try one of the pitcher drinks.  Very refreshing and they bring lots of extra ice as needed."}
{"text":"We went there for a staycation.  I joined their club as well. They had a big group there so we didn't get the room upgrade. Had to change rooms because of bugs. The restaurant and bar were closed because of an event for the big group so we had to use the crowded lobby to use our drink coupons. The drink I ordered, one of their special drinks, was awful. They did replace it. You should know that parking is $18 per night. 
We had room service for breakfast and my husband's eggs were odd with a strange texture like they had been frozen or something. 
The hotel is very retro with mid-century modern decor. While it looks cool all of the chairs were very uncomfortable for sitting. Bathroom was kind of cool with a deep soaking tub, a separate shower and vessel sink. The bathroom is separated by a glass panel. When one person uses the bathroom during the night the whole room lights up. I tend to judge rooms by their linens. The towels were kind of harsh, not soft and fluffy. Like many higher end hotels, no fridge and never found a hair dryer. Overall this hotel was rather disappointing"}
{"text":"If you absolutely have to be in AZ, then why stay anywhere else besides the Ho? I love this little oasis in Old Town Scottsdale. I can fantasize that I am that girl who seduced Don Draper into coming with her and her band of merry vagabonds to Palm Springs in that one episode of Mad Men...

Needless to stay, I love the decor, and I hear that they put on some pretty cool events throughout the year, though one has not been happening at a time when I am in town. Even if you aren't staying here, just pop in for a drink and be whisked away to another era."}
{"text":"Overall very unhappy with the experience here.

The hotel overall was nice enough, the room size and cleanliness were great, the outdoor decor is very dated but I guess it works.  The pool scene was fun Saturday and relaxing Sunday. 

Now, the overwhelming negative: 
I booked a room for 4 (2 couples) on hotels.com for two nights totaling roughly $360.  We were traveling from DC and stayed in a different hotel for the first two night of our trip.  (Side note: that first hotel charged EXACTLY what I was quoted and pre-paid prior to our stay.)  The website asked only for my name when I booked, as I only used my credit card info.  Upon arriving to Valley Ho the receptionist asked for \"any names of people who might be staying with me who may need assistance during the stay.\"  Uh, sure, I'm obviously standing there with 3 other people--here are their names.  As soon as I provide 3 names the receptionist informs me that there will be a $25 charge per \"extra\" person per night--so $150 total.  Are you kidding me???  I booked a room for 4--it's 2 double beds--no one is \"extra\"!  This was almost a 50% up charge from what I was quoted online which is RIDICULOUS!  Add to that a $13-something per day car parking charge and you've got a total ripoff that would ruin anyone's impression of this place.

Oh, there's more.  We went to the pool both days and ran a tab, which we soon discovered included fraudulent charges!  Whether other people gave our name to steal drinks or the bartender intentionally ran it up--it's completely unacceptable.  I realize it gets busy at the pool bar and that the cocktail waiters coming around have lots of customers, but if we drank buckets of beer all day and there are separate margaritas on our tab that weren't ours we shouldn't have to pay for them!  

Despite loving Scottsdale we won't be back to this hotel.  It wasn't our first stay here but it was just an awful experience due to billing issues and it'll be our last."}
{"text":"I really love this hotel! Here's why:

Local- How rare is it to find a local hotel in your area? Okay well in AZ it's somewhat rare and this one is LOCAL and it's fantastic. Usually those two items don't go together.

Design- I love the retro vibe of the design. It's like stepping back in time but in the best way. It makes me want to wear cat-eye glasses and drink vintage cocktails. I love it! 

Bath Products- Yes, I know. How tacky am I that I'm even bringing this up but c'mon; we all secretly judge hotels by the quality of what they have in the bathroom. These Icelandic wonder potions smell amazing! AND the soap is a sphere. Holy shit! Nothing gives me more satisfaction than rolling that around in my hands as I wash them (it's the small things in life, really). Honestly, when I stayed here with a friend for my birthday we literally had the same fond memory \"SOAP BALLS!\" We recalled, affectionately. 

Customer Service- Every employee I've ever talked to is nice and upbeat. I like that, especially being a local that stays here for fun every now and again. 

The pool- Is awesome. Both of them (I just remembered there are two; one has a cool fountain and the other I've actually sat by). I love lounging out there and just checking out from life for awhile. Man- I need a staycation!"}
{"text":"This hotel was nice, clean, and perfect for our stay. Would stood out to me was how attentive the staff was whether you were ordering food or requesting your room to be cleaned. I would highly recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Whenever my brother is in town he always stays here so when the hubby & I were looking for a place to get away for a night we stayed here. We are the not the party crowd which is why we chose to stay here on a Tuesday after a holiday weekend. Here is my take on Hotel Valley Ho: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.

Good:
1) Gigantic, comfy bed. I slept like a queen.
2) Private balcony with large chaise lounge and sitting area.
3) Outstanding bathroom. The tub is separate from the shower which is and the toliet has a room all to itself.
4) Cool decor both interior and exterior. 

Bad:
1) Bed pillows were too squishy. 
2) Toliet paper/bath tissue was surprisingly rough. I would expect a hotel of this caliber to have a softer tissue.
3) The mini bar and console are fully stocked with an assortment of spirits, but no coffee or tea. Not everyone that stays here drinks his/herself into a stupor.

Ugly:
1) Parking is $15 per day, but you have the option to self park which doesn't cost a thing so I guess that's not really \"ugly\".

Overall, we had a lovely stay at Hotel Valley Ho and look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"The hotel is nice on the inside. It's definitely been upgraded and the room comes with nice amenities and the staff is friendly.  I would definitely say it's very retro chic! Love the colors and the white brick walls with orange curtains and the translucent glass between the beds and the bathroom area! There is definitely a nice vanity area with cool lighting and retro chairs!  I have to say the carpet was wet in certain areas and I saw a dead cockroach in the shower area floor.. There was also a tiny bug on the bed.. But big deal.. The weather is hot so I'm assuming it's hard to keep pests at bay especially on the 1st floor.  There is a tub with \"mood\" lighting and a shower and separate toilet area with a door! Very cute, modern, and retro at the same time.  The pool I wouldn't say is super glamorous but it works and has a ton of chairs.. The lounge area is nice as well as the check-in area."}
{"text":"Valley HO! 

I dig. 

Picture this. A cooler version of the Brady Bunch decides to buy a hotel in Scottsdale. The kids get to decorate the rooms and design the pool. There are cabanas, retro furniture sprawls about, everyone is friendly (I mean for real, like JUMPING to get you stuff) and the beds are like little patches of poofy clouds. 

I stayed in a \"Cabana King,\" which was just splendid. Outdoor seating right by the pool, a bathroom with a separate soaky tub and rain shower, and oh.my.GOD. Did I mention the bed? I NEVER sleep that well in hotels, but this was like a little lullaby. MMM, a good night's rest. PRICELESS. 

The retro vibe is hardly understated. In fact, it's just WAY over the top, but it works well. Every detail is taken into account, nothing is overlooked. Each font, color, piece of furniture, accessory, fixture, paint color, staff member: CHECK PLUS. 

SO, why the 4 stars? Room service is a bit ridiculous (add a 20 percent gratuity, AND the food was not so great. An omelette with burnt bacon and WAY too much soft cheese for a normal person to consume). I'd skip the restaurant. It tries hard, but falls short...

The beds and the pool are where it's at, FO SHO...Valley HO! I'll stay again."}
{"text":"I was a day visitor to the spa and pool, so I can't comment on the rooms. I loved this place! Starting with the valet staff, everyone I encountered were very friendly and efficient. The fitness room looked good, well stocked with good equipment and a view of the outside and it appeared clean. The spa itself is on the smaller side, but every inch was inviting and clean. My massage therapist Jennifer was an experienced pro and gave a really good massage - far above the quality you'd get at a strip mall  (so locals should give this spa a try). Before and after, I was able to enjoy the salt water lap pool - very relaxing. I love the decor of this whole place - totally and originally retro chic.And the second floor hallways are lined with photos of the movie stars that had stayed there in the past, along with vintage memorabilia. Reminded me of the original Sands hotel in Vegas before they put up the Venetian. The public spaces like the front reception, lounge were very inviting and I definitely want to go back with friends for dinner/drinks. I spoke to guests by the pool and they said the rooms were retro but renovated and they were repeat visitors who loved the location (walkable to downtown Scottsdale) and the hotel itself."}
{"text":"Quirky, fun and very dialed in.  I really enjoy this place. Rooms are colorful and comfortable.  Nice bed.  Staff extremely helpful and attentive.  Easy walk to Old Town.  This is my second stay and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Had a great time at the hotel last weekend. The pool staff was great! We received free drinks with our cabana rental. The pool staff also set us up with treats in our room. We will for sure come back here."}
{"text":"Happy 4th of July! 

The girls and I got a room at the Valley Ho this weekend to celebrate our nations birthday. We had more fun then we anticipated. :-) 

First the room was very nice! Perfectly located on the second floor over looking the pool area with a nice patio and clean. We quickly unpacked, had a cocktail and headed to the pool. With hotel pools high on everyone's to-do list every summer I like the Ho 'cuz they don't let the \"riffraff\" in; you have to be a guest of the hotel to frequent the pool on \"party session\" days. The pool isn't huge so this helps to keep the environment fun and not cramped. The pool bar also had some great specials on drinks; $15 buckets of beer (4 Peaks and PBR), $6 fruity cocktails and some appetizer specials. 

Once back to the room it was time to get ready for the night festivities... with four girls you know that more shampoo, towels and robes were a must. Georgeann G. to the rescue, she quickly phones the from desk and in less than 5 minutes there was a knock on the door. So fast! 

Over all we all had a great time. Affordable prices, great location, clean, friendly staff, and great location to start the night party. You can walk to Trader Vic's, Mable's on Main and the Coach House."}
{"text":"Stayed here and enjoyed it. I watched the hotel being built out when my parents lived around the corner. Fun place and great location, right across the street from Tortillas Flats."}
{"text":"hotel valley HO!!

has a 'sands casino' vegas resort- circa mid 60's feel. like u'd see the rat pack sippin martinis in the lounge. vintage/modern flavor so its very hip.. maybe even 'groovy'.

suite is amazing. the fullest decked out kitchen ive seen in manya suites. furniture vintage/modern too.. keeping up with the rest of the resorts ambiance. super clean. fridge and wet bar are stacked! not just dinky airplane bottles.. full bottle of goose, champagne and wines.

hotel staff amazing. room service lightning fast and menu items are very appetizing. definately get the mac-n-cheese with ham added. and the turkey club with extra thick cured bacon.. trader vic's restaurant is part of the hotel if you wanna get fancy with it. go with the braised duck or filet oscar.

the only complaint would be the 110 degree weather this past weekend but im not gonna dock a star for weather they cant control lol. 

directly across the street and walking distance from old town scottesdale, which is the 'it' place to be for nightlife. and the nightlife is pretty awesome. check out stingrays and esp geisha to get the night started right.
 
highly recommend staying here."}
{"text":"The service at the pool was mediocre and after my wife closed out the tab we were charged full price when the website and two different front desk clerks informed us that it was half off Trish and Annie. When my wife went to confront the bartender they fiddled around with the receipt and gave her an itemized one and then informed her the half off doesn't apply to holidays. His words \"ummm yeah so it's Memorial Day so half is doesn't apply on holidays.\" She questioned him again and was just given the same answer. After leaving she called the front desk and spoke with Annie about it who took her name and number down and said the manager would get back to her. We've waited two days thinking maybe since it was the \"holiday\" and they would be busy that we would hear back. But it's clear now that obviously some places in Scottsdale do give it the bad nickname Snobsdale for a reason. Without any care they took the extra money and lied about the half off. No where on the website nor Yelp does it say *half off is excluding holidays*. Needles to say it's really petty that the hotel would need to swindle money, I guess they really need it. We won't stay here or ever recommend anyone to come to their \"events\" since it's seems to be a scam. It's unfortunate because the grounds seemed really nice and so did the pool but service was very poor and also false. Again I would not recommend coming here in fear that you'll be over charged and given average service. There is plenty of other hotel pools here in Arizona that offer far better service and don't lie about their events."}
{"text":"valley ho: easy. accommodating. youthful. clean. updated. relaxing. within walking distance to a variety of restaurants/shops.

zuzu restaurant for breakfast: yummy food/strong coffee. [eggs benedict] 

overall a good pick. mature. great for those of us in our 30's+."}
{"text":"This past weekend I attended a beautiful wedding in Arizona. The wedding was outdoors and Valley Ho was a great place to have it! When you enter the hotel the colors and décor definitely make you feel like you're an a upscale establishment. The wedding venue was next to a pool, but there were no distractions. The setting was beautiful, bride was beautiful, and hotel views were outstanding.

After the reception we headed to the roof top for cocktail hour and what a view!!!! 360 degree view of Scottsdale, the mountains, and the beautiful pools below. After cocktail hour we made our way to the reception room which was also spacious and nicely decorated. 

The staff was wonderful. I wasn't on my A game this time and forgot to bring a pair of flip flops. My friend and I went to the hotel boutique and he open up the store for us and even gave us a discount on our much needed flip flops. It's little expereinces like those that make me really want to stay here again."}
{"text":"This Labor Day my love suprized with sat morn spontaneous getaway, Rooms were big. All around really Layed back. Party time at the pool was an awesome option!  Ordered late night food that was great and arrived Very fast the 24 hr room service (always great. )Sunday morn. Was  build your own Sunday bloody Mary's !!They had  very stocked variety filled mini bar .. , a very friendly staff , LOVED the spacious room with tub in the middle very retro. Convenient location with lots too do all around. Over all was a good experience. I recommend it."}
{"text":"They did a fantastic job renovating this place. It's a great place for a special occasion. My friend had his wedding here... it's a perfect spot. The bar area is neat, but way overpriced. It's a little hoity toity for me as well... if you've got that kind of money, you would probably like it.

The pool area is nice, but frequently crowded with what appears to be Mtv Spring Breakers or models. Actually - crowds depend on time of day/week/month/year... The rooms are quite nice and once they finish construction next door, the views will be good again. I don't like to valet my car, so I'm not a fan of the parking situation. The Ho makes a great backdrop for photo shoots as well. 

I think if you have wealthy family or friends in town, this is one of the better options available. It's also good to meet some friends at the bar if you've got the dough and want to play dress-up. I'm glad they decided to keep it around... I'm kinda upset though that they changed the Valley Ho sign on the corner of 68th and Indian School... after all that work to renovate the place, they finally lose that sign that has been there since I can remember. Pity."}
{"text":"I am in the media business as a photographer and I have just found my new favorite place - I was not sure where to go to celebrate mine and my husband's one year anniversary so my publisher said \"valley ho is where the cool kids go\" I had to laugh because I thought \"is this a joke, could there really be a place with such a name that is romantic?\"   Let me back up and say I am from Minneapolis and knew nothing about this place or the amazing history. Once we pulled up we were greeted by some really amazing valet guys, tip well those boys deserve it for running in the AZ heat. While checking in Marni was amazing and put us in a room she would prefer, so we were upgraded and when we walked into our room my husband was like a kid,  he was so shocked at how amazing the room was but we wanted to explore so we went to trader vic's happy hour and met Raven and many other business owners to network with ... It was an absolute blast. I am sorry to say they are going out of business at the end of July but the valley ho will still be incredible.. 
The pool party was like no other but get to the pool early to get the best spots, the service was incredible and Rocky deserves major props for all his hard work not to mention all the staff at the pool. 
I fell asleep after my day at the pool and missed dinner at Eddie's house and my ride on the bunny cart with my pal Zach so I ordered room service and the woman that delivered it was so amazing and my sandwich was incredible... 
ZuZu was good but I think the lady that served us was not happy we came in so late and never asked if we wanted a drink, I had to order from someone else. The food was amazing and I was happy with my meal... 

Thank you everyone at Valley Ho for an incredible weekend.... We will be back ASAP... 

Oh and please note this is NOT a hotel for kids on weekends - the pool is not the place you want to bring them as it gets wild on Saturday so leave the kiddos at home unless it's a week day...."}
{"text":"Arriving to the front entrance of the Ho, I felt like I was an extra in a Brady Bunch vacation episode. This mid-century modern destination isn't contrived, but I genuinely felt as if I was transported to a different time period, while still maintaining 21st century amenities and luxury. 

From the welcome at the front desk to checking out and grabbing my luggage at the valet stand, my entire stay was five stars and I'm already planning my next trip to Scottsdale, just to spend it all at Valley Ho. 

Spacious rooms are hard to come by in boutique hotels, but not here. I was spread out all over my king suite with plenty of room to spare. The mood lighting in the bathroom actually persuaded me to take a bath (not normally a bath girl, here), and the lovely smelling toiletries caused me to hoard the little bottles each day so that housekeeping would be sure and replenish my stock (guilty!). The king bed itself was what a traveler's dreams are made of. Ample pillows, fluffy duvet, and a mattress made of clouds. 

But oh, that chaise lounge on my balcony overlooking the pool where I posted up with my laptop for a good two hours. Let's just say, if my work sessions weren't mandatory during my trip, no one would have been able to get me to leave my little oasis."}
{"text":"Awesome retro inspired hotel. We stayed here for spring training and would have given it 5 stars but the construction across the street made it very difficult to relax, sleep in, and read on our deck. We did enjoy a cabana and the pool during the day and also had lunch on the patio, which was very good. Service is awesome, it's close to old town, and staff is very friendly. Got a suite overlooking the pool, great space and amenities."}
{"text":"After frequentlng Cafe ZuZu's awesome happy hour many times, I decided to book a staycation over the Labor Day weekend. Every person we encountered on the hotel staff were extremely friendly and gracious, from the valet to the front desk to housekeeping. We love the look and vibe of this retro hotel, and the room we had was gorgeous as well. Very mod and different than the standard old boring room that you tend to get with every other hotel. 

The only thing that initially gave me pause was that upon check-in, we were informed that there was going to be a big pool party on Saturday (YAY), but that this was only for hotel guests (BOO). Anyone attending that was not a guest of the hotel would be charged a $25 admission. This was a bit upsetting, as we'd already invited a few of our local friends to come and lounge around the pool with us on Saturday. However, upon speaking with the front desk about this the next day, they handed us free admission passes for our friends to come to the pool with us, no questions asked. 

I was also pleasantly surprised with how affordable it was to order drinks and food at the pool. I was expecting Vegas-like prices (AKA $14 per cocktail), but was very happy to see that you could order cocktails for $6, and buckets of beer for $15. 

Overall, the look, vibe, price, value and service were all higher than expected, and we'd book another stay at the Hotel Valley Ho no questions asked!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous place this is!  Now I didn't stay at the actual hotel, but the pool is fantastic!  I just moved to Scottsdale from San Diego and I was told that this is a great pool to go to.  I went with a Meetup group a few weeks ago where we had 2 cabanas for our group.

The pool is very clean and there were lots of fun floaties in and around the pool, yes those huge donut and unicorn ones!  The service is great and we got drinks and food very quick!  When I went up to the bar, there was hardly even a line.  Prices are good, about $10 average for a drink and having come from CA, that's pretty darn good!

I was there on a Sunday and the DJ was playing some great jams while everyone partied, relaxed, swam and sunbathed the day away.  Hotel itself seems very nice and good for families, girlfriends and/or business travelers."}
{"text":"Decor is strangely reminiscent of the movie swingers.  Hotel has a 50s motif done tastefully.  Got an awesome rate through the hotel tonight app on my iphone.  My only complaint was that they had a very tiny self parking lot, almost forcing you to pay 14 bucks for the valet unless you want to do street parking.   Room was surprisingly spacious and even had small balcony making it almost perfect if traveling with your dog as we were.  Food and service at the restaurant was decent. If not for the parking, this place definitely deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"Horrible Costumer Service. I am getting married on Sunday the 25th and have been trying for months to get a late check out. (Check out is at 12 and I need to check out at 1:30) They are unwilling to make any accommodations until the day before my wedding. Obviously this is unacceptable. I can't believe that they would go so far as to ruin someone's wedding plans and leave a bad taste in their mouth for an hour and a half. This hotel is not that amazing they're much nicer in the area for the same price. It's really hard for me to believe that  they will be getting enough reservations for Sunday that they absolutely need my room for the additional hour and a half. I'm so disappointed in their way of handling the business. Too bad."}
{"text":"I love the rooms and the modern feel to a classic hotel. The rooms have all the details and feels so retro but updated. I love it. The location is awesome and I love the vibe."}
{"text":"I returned to this gem to meet a friend for lunch at the ZuZu Restaurant.  We met a little after the normal lunch hour, so we were lucky enough to have a relatively quiet meal and to could catch up on what we both have been doing. She's an artist, I'm a writer, so our paths only cross when we can find time from our busy schedules to make it happen. We like to find places to meet where we will be inspired. Hotel Valley Ho is definitely one of those little spots of inspiration in our valley.

We, of course, took the tour with Ace Bailey again. My friend had never been to the Hotel Valley Ho, although she is a long time resident of the Phoenix area. Like so many others, who don't even know this gem exists. 

History always inspires. This was my second tour (and probably not my last!) and I learned and saw nooks and crannies that I missed the first time around. Was I inspired? You bet! I have a short story brewing in my head. Setting? The Hotel Valley Ho, of course.

I know every city has their little islands of history and inspiration . . . but I am sure none that will take you back to a place and time in history like the Hotel Valley Ho does! Do not pass up this opportunity to be inspired!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. It is boutique-y, sweet, contemporary, and a little piece of paradise. 

The pool is fun, the staff is approachable and friendly, and the restaurant, ZuZu rocks. I could live on the granola that they make in-house. 

On the granola topic, the last day of my stay, I had to leave the hotel at 6:30am in order to catch a flight. I woke up at 4:30am to hit that granola up one more time before leaving. That's how good it is. No joke."}
{"text":"REVIEW UPDATE WEEWWW WEEEWWW WEEEWWW (that's my review update siren. 

So happy to have stayed at the Ho this week. When Gabi M told me that Firesky was filled and she was putting me at VHo, I didn't complain (secretly it's my fave place when I'm up in Scottsdale). And my fave place just got better, and just got another star because Jesse rocked my socks off with his awesome response to my review of the spa products. This time around I knew to ask for something a little less redflower, a little less Icelandic. I'm sure a lot of people dig it, not this people, er uh me. Anyway, I loved my room, I loved the option to swap soap, I loved that even though the place was at capacity noise was at a minimum, I loved that even when it cooled down to 60 at night people were still at the pool, it was a big ole love fest. Can't wait for my next trip, hopefully everywhere else will be sold out or Gabi will realize that it's my first choice ;). (In other news I think I have Andrea R convinced that we need to work poolside next-time!)"}
{"text":"Beautiful hotel.  I got a 'DealChicken' deal for a night here and was super excited to check it out.  I am a bit of a hotel freak.  I love checking out new hotels.  I go for the boutique, antique and eclectic hotels, and I really know my way around a hotel room. (Innuendo fully intended for laughs.)

I really, really wanted to like the Valley Ho and happily, I wasn't disappointed.

Some of the highlights:

Awesome mid-century modern decor, with an unexpected pops of color here and there.  It's almost as if you expect to see a reincarnated member of the Rat Pack to come strutting over from the lounge with a Highball in his hand.
  
Beautiful bathrooms with nice finishing touches.  The whole bathroom is walled in with frosted glass walls and a sliding door.  The vanity and sink area was marble with a porcelain bowl sink and featured higher end toiletries, a hair dryer and generous supply of soft fluffy towels.  The toilet was hidden in its own water closet with a sliding door.  The tiled shower had a rain shower head, and the extra large, Kohler soaker tub had a blue mood light placed seductively above it and a handily placed white cotton bathrobe within arms reach.  Very inviting.

The beds were super soft Sealy mattresses and were smartly made with crisp cotton sheets and soft, white down duvets.  The only think I didn't like with the beds was the ill fitting blue suede platforms for the box springs. The platforms weren't spaced tightly enough to the box springs to keep from showing the ugly unfinished part of the platforms.  A very minor detail.  Another thing I didn't care for was the blinding fluorescent light bulb in the bedside lamp.  It was a terrawatt in strength, I'm sure...  (Softer bulb, please?)

The end of the room featured a double, sliding glass patio door and wall to wall black out curtains with sheer drapes that could both be swept back, creating huge passway between the room and the spacious private patio; which had a dual, padded lounge chair and a mid-sized patio table and an view of the well kept patio greenery and fence (first floor room).

The rest of the room was spacious and the only small drawbacks on the look of the room is that the mid sized, flat panel television set is placed on a large counter top in front of a HUGE expanse of stark, white block wall.  It makes the television look lonely and tiny against that huge white wall.  Maybe add some inexpensive, colorful art work on that back wall to jazz it up some?

The minibar is something else and had a lovely stock of hard alcohol, mixers, sodas, snacks and even some Valley Ho themed playing cards and a corkscrew, in case you forgot your own.  The prices seemed reasonable to me, but then I got raped for a $15 bottle of water (that's right $15) at some fancy pants hotel right off the Champs-Élysées in Paris.  (My butt STILL hurts over that.)   

There was also a mini, pod style coffee maker and real half and half creamers in the fridge.  NICE TOUCH...extra star! (But please provide a few more creamers, 4 creamers is not quite enough...)

We ate our dinner at Cafe ZuZu and to be honest, I was underwhelmed about the food.  It was nice, but not worth what they were asking for it.  If it hadn't been for the strong pour on my mojito cocktail (and the 2 free cocktails coupon upon check-in) I would have been a LOT more disappointed in that dinner.  But I do have to say that we were given a complimentary dessert...some kind of a peanut butter mouse frosted in a velvety chocolate ganache and garnished with gold leaf, and it was simply delectable.  No other words to describe it.

We visited the pool after dinner.  It was very nice and completely deserted.  In fact I checked to make sure we weren't entering at the wrong hours since we were all alone, but no, it seems all the drunken pool party types were still out in Scottsdale bars getting hammer faced so they could REALLY party later that night.  We had it all to ourselves!  :)  My ONLY complaint was that the hot tub, which I was so looking forward to, was *just* lukewarm.  Bummer!  We consoled ourselves with a hot bubble bath for two, so the evening still ended well...  ;)

After we tucked in for the night I never heard a peep from the other guests, the walls are sound proof and I loved that.  Also, we didn't have some squeaky voiced house keeper banging on our door at the crack of 8:30 the next morning (I was hung over, okay??) saying \"Housekeeping!  I clean your room?\"  That is my biggest hotel-related pet peeve.

The front desk checked us out efficiently and pleasantly the next morning.  We misplaced our valet ticket but it was no problem, they called valet and asked for our car to be brought up anyway.  The valet attendants were very friendly and had our car ready to go within 3 minutes.  

We pulled away and I was just a little sad...  It was such a nice stay I was sad it was already over.   We have to go back again soon!"}
{"text":"First time staying at the Valley Ho but it will not be my last!  The staff  we encountered throughout our entire staff were so friendly, personable, down to earth, and over the top helpful!   Luis at check in, our room service both at dinner and breakfast, Valerie in the spa give the WORLDS GREATEST MASSAGE!  She suggested the marble stone upgrade for my face and it was heavenly!  I can't wait to go back!  The spa facilities were a bit disappointing as there aren't many amenities or areas to relax.  But the massage made up for it!  Satin sheets, warm robe after, marble stone, it was amazing.  Our room was gorgeous, spacious, modern and filled with amenities!  We had room 3101 right outside was a fountain so we had our doors open most of the stay.  We ordered the burrata appetizer, bacon burger, shrimp cocktail, cheesecake and for breakfast the Arizona omelet was amazing!  At the bar the seasonal mule was delicious too!  Highly recommend the entire experience at the Hotel Valley Ho & Spa!"}
{"text":"I've only been to hotel valley ho twice and both times were to use the pool with a friend staying at the hotel. The pool area is great, lots of chairs, and the service is pretty good! I wish there was a bit more to do at the pool but overall it's a very nice place to hang out when staying in PHX!"}
{"text":"Very nice retro like ambiance. Beautiful at night too. Very clean rooms and pretty quiet considering the younger to middle-aged crowd. Pool party until 6pm looks like alot of fun too. 

Only gripes are having to carry luggage up a flights of stairs to a second floor room in AZ summer or paying someone to do it for you. Room wasn't ready even though I checked in an hour after the 4 pm check in time. Parking overnight is $15. Guess all hotels are doing this. Otherwise very helpful and kind staff. Beautiful place. Takes you back in time too."}
{"text":"My Sister from Another Mister, Vicky T. already did justice to the myriad of ways we can play with this name so I won't add to it.  My friends from the SBC were here over the weekend and some of them stayed here so we got to hang out for a bit. This review is not based on price or the service from the hotel but rather the decor and ambience.   I LOVE the decor here!!  It FEELS like the 1950s/1960s.  I swear I have a picture of my parents in a place just like this.  I pulled into the parking lot but it was not clear where to park so I asked the valet.  He said I would park around the back for $5.  I parked on the street since there was tons of space there. There is a beautiful lawn area in front of the hotel and, upon walking into the lobby, the theme is apparent.  My friends and I hung out in the bar for a bit and had a nice cool drink.  The bartender and waitress were friendly and helpful.   Later we went to check out the spa, which was nice, and the women on dutry there were very helpful.  They asked us if we wanted tea and then put some in a to go cup for one of our friends.  The gift/spa shop had some nice souveniers, pricey like most any hotel, but nice none the less. Next was the room my friends stayed is....wow...very nice, spacious, flat screen TV and a nice big bathtub and shower.  The only think I'm not sure I really like was that the tub/shower/sink area was not enclosed with a door.  It had a curtain that went around it to separate it from the bedroom.  All I could think of was getting water all over the floor.  But I digress.....   This room was a garden view and it was really lovely.  The grounds are well kept and seemed very peaceful.  I would like to go back and try Cafe ZuZu since we had seen Chef Sean Currid
earlier at the Farm Sessions.  I thought his dishes were really great. 
The round pool was very clean and inviting and there were plenty of tables, chairs, and chaises to lounge on.  There is an outdoor bar as well as a kiosk for towels.  The location is another great feature of this hotel.  It is a short walk to Scottsdale's Old Town.  Would I stay here....yes for sure.  And I think Frank and Dean might have stayed here too.  Nicely done Valley Ho."}
{"text":"If you're a local, check out their spa's slow day specials (most often a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday). It's a nice little spa in a great location and the staff was pretty good too!. It doesn't hurt that Trader Vic's is so close by and has tropical happy hour specials for afterwards :)!. Great Staycation location! 
Here's a sample of the newsletter spa specials:

{"text":"I love the Valley Ho! I threw my sister's bachelorette party in Scottsdale and the Valley Ho immediately came to mind. I knew the weather was going to be amazing outside so I was excited to see that they had the Terrace Suite. The Terrace Suite was a swanky, retro style suite with a balcony/terrace that was 850 square feet! It was as big (if not bigger) than the room itself. The Suite was next to the pool and it was the perfect suite for me to set up a candlelit dinner outside. The bathroom was huge, with enough mirror for everyone to get ready and a huge bathtub and shower. The bed was extremely comfortable and the service was amazing. I didn't run into any problems during our stay and the bellboy was very nice and helpful with any baggage that we needed carried up the stairs (they don't have an elevator). We got our nails done on the terrace while we sipped on some Dom Perignon mimosas, it was awesome, just as I planned. They have plenty of parking if you do not wish to valet, which was more conveniant given the location our room was closer to the lot than the front desk. The service was great, they would ask if we needed more towel every day (which we did), so wonderful! I would recommend this Hotel to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my stay here. The entire property is very hip and comfy. The rooms are large with cool decor. The restaurant, Cafe ZuZu, serves great food and drinks. The pool is fabu. And the spa is a the perfect spot to be pampered (even for us guys). The location is also a plus; close to downtown and the arts district. I recommend this hotel and look forward to my next stay.

*The Hotel Valley Ho is a gay-friendly TAG Approved property."}
{"text":"I came here the other day to meet a few people for some drinks and I have to admit, the Ho has definitely kicked it up a notch.  It's right by old town, and they've revamped it to make it hip and trendy.  

The service was great and the drinks were strong.  What more could I ask for?  I didn't get to see any rooms, but the pool area looked really fun and they have a bunch of parties there in the summer, so I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stay in the Tower Suites at Hotel Valley Ho!

These rooms are amazing and you will not regret staying here.  The service was excellent and rooms were immaculately clean and comfortable.  The entire hotel is cool, swanky, and retro with a great vibe.  Absolutely no complaints from the food to service or anything else.  

What an awesome weekend at Hotel Valley Ho.  I will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"Such an eclectic and great hotel. Loved the ambience. Service was superb. Pool area was a fun party spot. 
Blake with Valet went above & beyond with professional courtesy and friendliness 
Front desk staff was always helpful."}
{"text":"Valley Ho, I bow down.

I wasn't really sure what to expect upon arriving at the Ho, but I was already anticipating not liking it as much as I like the Saguaro. Turns out I was wrong.

Valet was super friendly and offered me a bottle of water (which I needed, considering it was basically 200 degrees outside), and the front desk got me checked in right away. The first thing I noticed was the bright colors and modern atmosphere - oh and also ZuZu, which has earned five stars of its own. A nice gentleman grabbed my bag and helped me to my room, which was a bit of a hike around the pool.

There's no other way to say it... my room was mind-blowing. The king size bed was insanely comfortable, there was a personal coffee bar, a martini set, and a mini bar... TONS of counter space, huge mirrors, and the sheer size of the room was impressive in its own right. Let's also not forget the giant bathtub in the middle of the room, with optional blue mood-lighting, and wrap-around curtains if you want some privacy. The bath products were wonderful, the shower's water pressure just right, and I was in heaven for a good three days.

I really love the pool, and can't wait to see the two new ones when I'm back in October. The personal, rent-able cabanas are super fun, and they have a nice pool bar as well. The fitness center gets five big stars, they have yoga in the morning, and I'm going to stop writing now and just say I'm in love with this hotel.

My only gripe was that my room was on a corner, and it was so hot. Regardless of the 60 degrees I had it set on, the temp never went below 74 degrees. Five stars regardless, because the pros seriously outweigh the one con. 

Clearly, I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I am a local and wanted something cool to do for my fiance's birthday and a friend recommended the Valley Ho.
And I am glad she did.
We stayed in the studio guest room, she had a massage at HV Spa and we had dinner at Cafe Zuzu, all of which were wonderful.
Our room was huge, private patio, decent view, comfortable bed and furniture. Not only do you get shampoo, bodywash, the usual, but even Qtips. There are your standard water glasses as well as martini and wine glasses. These little extra touches made it all the more enjoyable and worth the price.
The hotel is one of the coolest that I have ever stayed in. It is in pristine condition, everything is immaculate and sheik, the decor and design is  a perfect combo of retro and modern that compliments the feel of the hotel. The staff is helpful and out of their way friendly.
It is upscale without being pretentious, trendy without being cheesy and an amazing experience that I would recommend to both visitors and locals alike.
The one negative is a $12 parking charge, as other reviewers have mentioned."}
{"text":"Hung out at the pool in a cabana... I love the day but my waitress did not bring me my change when I paid my first tab in cash... BIG MISTAKE seeing as I never said to keep it... a huge pet peeve and something that should never be assumed.

I hope this is not representative of the wait-staff as I love the brunch at Zuzu and would love to return to the pool for a relaxing day! (tip - reserve it on a Sunday)"}
{"text":"\"I keep going to a lot of places and ending up somewhere I've already been.\" - Don Draper (Mad Men, season 3)

As soon as you pull up into Hotel Valley Ho's driveway, you know it's going to be special. Maybe it's the Beach Boys playing in the background or the retro sign lit up against the palm trees. But this ain't your questionable roadside motel.

Had the pleasure of staying at Hotel Valley Ho for a few nights in May. Everything from the king room to a late night dinner at Zuzu (while watching the Mad Men finale) was just my style. I love all things mid century modern and this takes the cake. Even when you're staying for work, it feels like a vacation blast from the past. 

Accommodations were perfect. Bed was big and very comfy. Even had a patio with a small table and chairs that overlooked one of the two pools onsite, perfect for early morning email catch up. Kudos to the expansive counter inside and little stool. We ladies like that extra space for getting pretty No giant tub in the middle of the room, but that's good since I'm a shower gal anyway. Luxe products that I gladly took home at the end of my stay.

Because it was a weeknight, Valley Ho was anything but packed. The one day I was able to take a few hours and lay out, had the whole pool to myself. No wait for an outdoor table for breakfast. Valets run to pick up your vehicle, even when there's no rush. 

The entire visit felt completely nostalgic and carefree. I want to go back right now."}
{"text":"I love the Valley Ho! It's a beautiful property with great rooms, a fantastic pool, an excellent restaurant -- Trader Vic's and a really nice spa. Be sure to stay in the newly re-modeled Loft Suite. It's two stories and it's fantastic! If I was to take a stay-cation, I would be sure to stay at the Valley Ho! And for all you out-of-towner's who want to stay in Old Town Scottsdale and be close to great shopping, restaurants, and nightclubs, the Valley Ho should be at the top of your list!"}
{"text":"If I had traveled with a pack of kids, I might have given Valley Ho a 5+ rating; it was so retro-cool and unique. But as a single traveler hoping for a relaxing resort setting, I have to rate it lower. The noise from the pool DJ started almost as early as the screams of playing children. This, in addition to the less than effective curtains, made it impossible to sleep in. This seems to be a basic requirement of a relaxing vacation. Since the hot tub was a child friendly temperature (warm,not hot), I felt like everything was geared toward young families. Again, if I was with a family, I would be pleased. As a single traveler, I was disappointed.  Cool theme, cool neighborhood, just not a relaxing place to be."}
{"text":"What a great place! In addition to the physical facilities, which have been restored and maintained in their Rat Pack splendor, the staff is so accommodating and professional. I have stayed here several times since discovering the Valley Ho a few years ago, and it never disappoints. The guest rooms are lovely (even the smaller ones, and the suites are spectacular!), the common areas are beautiful, and the food and libations are delicious. From the moment you drive up until the minute you check out, this place is comfortable and delightful - a spot to get away from it all while enjoying all the perks of Scottsdale. A real treasure!"}
{"text":"We stayed here for our honeymoon in October (just getting around to writing this now). Overall, the hotel met my expectations as far as how it was pictured on their website. Very cool and different, which was what we wanted. Due to the time of year, it was in the quieter side, but didn't feel deserted, which worked for us.
The good: everything was clean and you can see the efforts are made to make everything feel up-to-date and convenient. Bed was comfortable and in-room complimentary products were wonderful. Landscaping and pools are beautiful. Interiors of hotel do a good job of balancing the old with the new. Love the nod to their story with historic pictures around the hotel. Conveniently located within walking distance of many restaurants and a convenience store, and the free trolley literally has a stop within 1 minute from the hotel. The food seemed on par with pricing in Scottsdale, and although not particularly memorable, was always very good. The spa experience (massage) was good and a good value. 
What could have been improved: some small details. We had made prior arrangements for a fridge to be in the room(extra fee) and we had to ask for it to brought in when we arrived very late at night. A few things in the room including an outlet in the bathroom and a light did not work. Several of the pool chaises looked \"tired\" and damaged and needed repair or replacing. My parents had called ahead and paid for our stay as a surprise, explaining that it was our honeymoon. This was presented to us at the end of our stay. I was mildly disappointed that, the hotel staff knowing this, didn't put that extra touch (maybe a complimentary split of champagne in our room)? Although there was always a decanter of water with herbs and fresh fruit in the lobby, there was not fresh coffee or tea available anywhere. You had a mini single serve pot in the room, otherwise you had to wait until the restaurant opened at 8 and pay $3 for a cup to go. While hotel staff was always courteous, didn't particularly feel overwhelmed with service until we started tipping the valet guys heavily. 
Overall, a good experience, just needed a few details to make it feel truly memorable."}
{"text":"The hotel was very clean and nice with modern decor. We had brunch at the hotel restaurant one morning and it was really yummy. They also had a \"make your own bloody mary\" bar with anything you could ever possibly want to put in a bloody mary. Good, central location too. If you are looking for a \"scene\" however - I would not stay here. I had heard in the past that the pool was really fun and had a DJ etc, but I went during prime spring training time and the pool was pretty dead."}
{"text":"The Valley Ho is such an awesome place to hang out and people watch.  My favorite spot is by the fireplace in the lobby...check out the flaming crystal rocks...cool.  It's fine to throw ice on them (i was not even drunk).  

The drinks are great and the service is also excellent...a little slow but to be expected when it's super busy.  

They have the best mac and cheese, so be sure order it if you want true comfort food.  My favorite drink is the Stardust.  

I have not been to the spa yet but I am familiar with the products they use and they rock.  I can't wait to try it!"}
{"text":"I've always loved the Ho. It's the epitome of hip. 

Their rooms are scattered around a rather large sized parcel and are all extremely comfortable and designed in very urban chic furniture. The bathrooms are super cool with blue mood lighting and sliding frosted glass doors. They have a restaurant in the lobby which I've never tried, but it looks like pretty standard American fare. The beds are very comfortable, and they feature all new LCD tvs with iPod plug ins."}
{"text":"Want to be treated like royalty? Stay at the Valley Ho. This is the second time in as many years that my wife and I have stayed at the Valley Ho. You are pampered by a staff that truly cares and that's sometimes hard to find in this day and age."}
{"text":"Believe all the good that you read and hear. This resort has few if any equals. We were blown away from the moment we stepped into the lobby. Forget the creepy Mad Man obsessions, this place is the real deal. The restoration is beautiful, the lines, colors, quality of life, service is all TOP SHELF. We stayed in a studio king by the 'adult' (lap) pool from a Sunday to Thursday. Perfect!  We basically had the pool and hotel to ourselves. Room is super spacious, even with a tub in the middle. Downsides - TV is small especially in such a big room, the A/C petered out on the second night and never quite caught up again. And we had bug bites - but I want to be 100% clear - these were from the grass outside NOT the room. So be careful. I recommend a Sun-Thursday stay if you are look for peace and beauty. Sadly enough, this is one of those resorts that caters to the loud, drunk 30-something boozers on the weekends with thumping DJs and lame loungers. As we were leaving, they were changing out furniture in the lobby and I am very sad to say that we may have been some of the last people to see the awesome retro sofas and hairs. I don't care much for the new materials and designs - not staying with the period. Let management know."}
{"text":"The manager at the front desk, Luella, was extremely rude to my husband and I on several occasions during our stay. The rest of the staff was wonderful- Hotel Valley Ho should not have someone like Luella in management who was disrespectful, snappy and did not epitomize the level of customer service one would expect at a nice hotel."}
{"text":"Be your own celebrity. Pour a martini, blare some Sinatra, don some flip-flops, a swimsuit and a robe, and step onto your patio in the Scottsdale sun. Lay out on the barcolounger. Take a dip in the pool. The world is your retro-oyster at the Valley Ho.

The rooms seamlessly balance comfort and luxury with sparse and modern style. The lines of these rooms are sharp and defined, counters uncluttered, space carefully used to convey both a smart and casual feel. My bed sat on the floor and it was a wonderful rest. 

And I loved the small stuff: a New York Times in the main lobby, the attentive manner of the staff, the easily maneuvered layout. This hotel, like Sinatra, has plenty of class, style and sophisticated charm. Not to be missed."}
{"text":"Everyone is so friendly at this hotel. It's super cute and has a 50's mod retro style with modern touches. You can definitely picture old Hollywood stars frolicking around here. Hotel Valley Ho is pretty big and there are many different wings. The beds are comfy and the bathrooms are spacious and they have both a shower and bathtub. They also have a cocktail shaker in case you want to make a martini in the room before you go out or go to bed. 

My favorite part of the Ho is the pool. They have a sick pool party on weekends which result in me wasting at least half the day listening to the DJ spin while dancing in the pool with a Ketel lemonade in my hand and getting periodically sprayed with sunscreen so I don't burn and have a perfect golden tan. This is what I was born to do."}
{"text":"This was now my group of friends second year in a row staying here around this time... Everything was phenomenal from the service to the food and the drinks the pool it was amazing... I checked in and my room was not quite ready they called me and I came down to the desk... They upgraded me to the tower at no charge so to say I was stoked was an understatement. We will not hesitate to visit this hotel every year from now on it was an amazing amazing experience the staff was all friendly and the food was good the breakfast we had was delicious the drinks were a little overpriced at the pool but that's to be expected at a resort especially in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"I have always loved this hotel and after recently discovering their happy hour specials, I love it even more! Three dollar drinks? Yes please! I highly recommend the pomegranate fizz - so delicious that I completely lost track of how many I had! The pool is great, the music is great...I highly recommend heading here after work to unwind one day this summer."}
{"text":"I grew up in Scottsdale and was there last weekend for a wedding, and I had never set foot in the Valley Ho, even though it was a landmark.  We were really pleasantly surprised, especially since the price was so reasonable (we booked on Hotels.com and got a better rate than the hotel had given for the wedding party).  It was fresh, cool, spacious rooms, really nice bathroom, good food in the cafe.  If I were coming for a resort vacation I wouldn't be totally psyched about the pool, which is small, but the lounging area around it was really pleasant.  Great location (if you can stand Old Scottsdale, which I can't) and close to Fashion Square mall which is something of a shopping mecca."}
{"text":"Love this spot! Very retro decor and great menu! The onion rings, fries and steak were perfect! 
Art was well selected and certainly worth looking at! Good pool menu too"}
{"text":"Dear Jesse T,
Thank you for your quick reply.
In response to your comment about the hotel room mix-up.  I was aware that this was the reason the keys weren't working, as I said previously my issue was the lack of concern and initiative on the part of the staff.  If you read closely, I believe I said that having new room keys wasn't a problem, but the fact that no one made any effort to give us our room keys and instead we had to go to the front desk late at night after finding out ours no longer worked, was an issue to me.  I will no longer be staying at your hotel, this is simply advice so you might retain long-term customers in the future. You have a nice hotel, but with that comes clientele that have certain customer service expectations.
In order to help you to check the wifi situation I will tell you we were staying in a room on the first floor to the right of the lobby.  However, I will not tell you what room to \"ensure the proper housekeeper is spoken to\". This is an overall problem and not the responsibility of one person trying to do their job.  In fact, if you assign rooms to certain housekeepers this could in fact be part of the reason it is not a team effort to first clean rooms with a sign on the door... No, it was an overall issue with cleanliness.  My mother pointed out one afternoon that the cigarette butt she had seen the previous evening in the walkway to our room was still there.  We were all a bit disgusted when we came back hours later and it was STILL there, even though there was a cleaning lady nearby.  Perhaps instead of chastising individual employees for a single dirty room there should be an overall standard of cleanliness for the entire hotel by which all employees are judged.  
Lastly, I understood the \"deal\" you were offering, but it was a Monday night and the room was free.  We were agitated and obviously not returning to your hotel.  Even making a slight allowance such as: \"how about if we still have plenty of rooms by tomorrow afternoon I'll give you the extra night\" would have perhaps made us reconsider our negative view on the service at your hotel.  Instead the woman behind the desk very coldly and rudely informed us of the \"rules\" you just stated and then turned away.  My sister lives in Scottsdale and used to recommend your hotel, but after seeing the way her family was treated and knowing how many better options there are, she told us she would never recommend the hotel again.  Yes, you may have lost one room for one night, but you may have gained 20 new visitors to your hotel.  I think a shrewd cost-benefit analysis may have put up with a small loss for a big future gain.  Again, this is all just advice, take it or don't, we most certainly won't be returning to check up on your progress."}
{"text":"A little cold today but the Pool is still nice! Drinks are a little expensive but that is to be expected. Decided to do a mid week 90 min massage and you get full use of the gym, sauna, and pool all day. Great deal for mid week pricing."}
{"text":"Wonderful hotel with a very unique ambiance and old school design. Make sure you request a new tower as it's absolutely exceptional."}
{"text":"Like the 80s group ABC sang \"It's so hip, so hip it hurts\"... But hurt in a good way (you know, like nice, naughty spanking) and not bad hurts like the sound of Lindsay Lohan's voice. Are we clear? I was an Urban Studies/Architecture major in college and I love this whole 50s style meets mid modern meets Scottsdale. From the lobby to the grounds to the pool to our charming, color splashed, glass brick adorned room, this was a major score in the Staycation category. I was initially intimidated by the pool crowd as I noticed NOBODY was actually IN the pool. Just posing around the pool. Were they looking at my pasty white Scandinavian skin? My extremely, freakishly small nipples? Or the Hello Kitty towel I brought from home? Hmmm..fBack to the room....the glass brick divided the room from the shower...and what a fabulous shower. Nice, big, pulsating head. Honestly, I'm not trying to go all pg13 on ya! Bed and bedding were cozy and spotless. A great place to crash after Rickie's headlining collection at Phoenix Fashion Week. The room was at one point spacious enough to accommodate Mr. Gonzales, the stylist, the assistant and anywhere from three to eight models. I was comfy on our fabulous bed with a glass of wine watching it all unravel in front me. Who needs TV? It was very entertaining. And when I needed to escape we had our own private patio. Wait? Wasn't that a B52s song? So Valley Ho...you are hip. But you're also great deal. A great venue. And yes, maybe even, OK, I\"m getting a little vaklempt, a great friend...."}
{"text":"Everything is so beautiful at this Hotel!!  It's got to be designed by a woman because 
the colors and the Bathtubs are what every woman dreams of!!

We also had an amazing dinner in the hotel Restaurant!!  Beef Stroganoff was amazing!!  Don't take this off the menu!!  (we heard you are planning to! :( )
Our favorite restaurant staff are Anna and Alyssa!! These women made us feel so at home and took the best care of us!! Customer Service is everything and these two really hit it out of the park for us!!  Everyone at the bar gave us first class service!!  oxox LOVE THIS PLACE!!"}
{"text":"The Valley Ho is unique and a breath of fresh air compared to other snooty resorts in Scottsdale. Looking around you feel like you have stepped into the 50's but with all modern day amenities. 

The rooms are very bright and large. The bathroom is my favorite with a huge deep tub and sultry blue light. One star is missing as you can see above and that is because the spa. It is very small and gets crowded very easily. They don't have enough chairs for everyone in the lounge and no jacuzzi. I also don't think that mtv playing on a flat screen is very relaxing. 

The Valley Ho has a deep history and they have done an excellent job reviving it!  If you want to have a good time I would choose the Valley Ho!"}
{"text":"Review - The service was great! the reservation dept, the valet, the front desk) were all top notch and it made an amazing evening with my GF. I recommend guest stay at towers and get the 2 level suite.  The bath products smell great, solid view of the pool, high quality bathrobe.   Only recommendation would be do free parking for Arizona residents who staycations.  The room service we ordered came quite fast too."}
{"text":"Way cute retro hotel with an amazing restaurant and great service. Can't wait for my next stay here."}
{"text":"Sherman, set the Wayback machine for 1961, we are going to the Hotel Valley Ho, in a little patch of desert called \"Scottsdale, Arizona\".
It was my birthday this week and my kids were in town to make sure that I continue to get older:)
I did get older, but not by much...and certainly no wiser:)
We stayed at the Valley Ho, so I could celebrate in style (and keep the condo neat and tidy:)
It wasn't so much a \"staycation\", as it was a chance to live a little differently for few days. You don't turn 40 for the first time very often and this seemed like a memorable way to mark the date:)
When we checked in at the Valley Ho, the Chairman (Frank Sinatra) was styling his way through \"Luck be a Lady\" and we thought we had stepped back to a simpler time...a time in which celebrity was worshiped and fawned over, just because they are famous...a time when you could lounge by the pool and day-drink your cares away...a time when just getting yourself to the bar was enough work for one day:)
In short, we stepped squarely into 2009:)
The Valley Ho delivers on the promise of nostalgia for an unremembered past...a mid-century revival of the avocado green, pastel turquoise and rust orange memories that almost none of us share, but that we all long for.
The Valley Ho takes you to the Disney version of 1961 and damn it, I liked it...a lot!
I found myself thoroughly enjoying the suite (the room and the hotel look like the '60's, but with HDTV, iPod plugs, decent tubs, good cell phone reception, double headed showers and really comfortable beds:)
I found myself wishing for the return of fins on my car and car hops on roller skates, along with $.25 a gallon gas and $.25 a gallon Tequila (almost interchangeable for both drinking and fueling purposes:)
Room service, spa, workout facility, restaurant and the pool are all first rate, and the people watching is wonderful...this place has become a destination again!
The pool is a terrific place to give people watching a real workout:) The Oh Bar pours a nice drink and they keep 'em comin!
Lots of eye candy for the guys and girls to ogle and everybody mixing and mingling like there is no tomorrow...and maybe that's true!
Maybe there is no tomorrow at the Valley Ho...When you step through the time warp back to 1961, but get to bring your 2009 stuff with you...the price you pay is getting stuck in the vortex of \"now\"...but at the Valley Ho, \"now\" seems to work:)"}
{"text":"I am getting is all out of my system before I continue with my review 
1. Ho-J (their version of Orange Juice)
2. H2O (HO water) 
3. You can lay your head down on the Valley Ho
4. Shirts/sweatshirts with VALLEY HO in large letters and hotel in smaller letters
5. Valley Ho... is there a Desert Ho? a Suburbia Ho? 
6. Why didn't they name their chapstick Ho-stick? 
7. Tally Ho to the Valley Ho 

I HEART 50s/ anything that is super themed to the max. I am one for if you are going to dedicate to a theme you totally dedicate your establishment 150%... Valley Ho goes for the full 200%. I got a chance to come in here as friends were staying and it is friggin awesome. I LOVE THE TUBS and the FAUCETS...call me weird... it is like stepping into a CB2 (Crate and Barrel's retro line) catalog. The decor in the bar/ ZuZu is all 50s like circles, sofas and it is funky and fun. Large patio spaces if you are on a bottom floor, cool set ups, comfy beds, large flatscreens, decent gym and spa. Bar has extensive beer, wine and hard alcohol/infusion drinks... cigar menu is a plus. 

Pleasantly surprised! If you don't stay here a very cool place to grab some food and bask in its awesomeness."}
{"text":"This is the best hotel I've ever stayed at. Ever. And I've stayed at plenty of nice and random hotels. The rooms are beautiful, the bathrooms are unreal/nice, the lighting in the rooms is pretty, the decor is incredible, the pool is perfect, the restaurants have great happy hour, the parking is free if you find street parking, and it's a quiet place because not that many people have discovered this gem! So let's keep it our little secret. Please?"}
{"text":"The Valley Ho had this incredible 'retro' vibe to it. Upon entering the lobby, we were greeted with the Beach Boys playing in the back ground and vintage chic furniture (with a modern twist). I had rented out the Tower Suite for my best friend's bachelorette party, and was extremely impressed with 1) the full kitchen 2) the size of the bathroom 3) the overall well-appointed room. We were also treated to a complimentary cheese and fruit plate (thank you, Valley Ho)! Very welcoming. I was a HUGEEEEEEEEE fan of the toiletries. the Red Flower Elder Berry scent was RIDICULOUS! Friends of ours had a double room in an older wing of the hotel, and it was a bit dated with concrete brick walls. If you're looking for something more modern, book your stay in the tower! 

I am in training for a competition, and had a need to work out twice a day. I was concerned that I would have to find a nearby gym in-order to do so. That was until I visited the hotel gym. The Valley Ho stakes claim to the BEST hotel gym I have been to, to-date. Pure awesome! There was a yoga room, numerous cardio machines, free weights, kettle bells, machines, and a smith machine! 

The pool area was very cute with the Tiffany blue lounges and yellow towels. My party was excited about the poolside menu's offering of mixed drink pitchers. 

I would say that I am more of a W girl, but was very pleased with my stay at this hotel. The retro feel may not appeal to everyone, but it made for a relaxing weekend away from California."}
{"text":"Starting this out simply (effusive praise to follow): I've stayed at a hell of a lot of hotels and Hotel Valley Ho might very well be my favorite *of all time*. The Mid Century-meets-Millenium  aesthetic, the history (check out the framed old postcards, brochures and souvenirs on the second floor), the friendly service, the endless amenities, the gym (large and well-equipped with a pool view) the *swell* rooms, the lush pool area, the lobby, the bar, the restaurant... oh oh oh, please excuse me as I break out in song, preferably a Monroe number where I'm wearing rosy satin and being carried around the property by a half dozen tuxedo'd gentlemen: \"Hotel Valley Ho is a girl's best friend.\" 

Where shall I start? I'm a gal who yearns for a past she never knew. A past where goils were goils and men were men. A time when a 5pm martini was de riguer and a lady would never in a zillion years wear sweat pants. A time when no one was reminded they needed to party \"responsibly\" and there was no such thing as sexting. Now, I'm not a luddite -more like an early adopter- but I can sure as heck pretend I'm existing in that glorious past when I'm ensconced at the glorious Hotel Valley Ho. 

And yet, there's not a single dated thing here. Modern amenities are subtle enough that they don't interfere, no less eclipse, the vintage vibe. And believe you me, you'll excuse the fact that no one had tubs with mood lighting back in '63 (though it is a subtle nod to the whole bathtub-in-the-kitchen thing that was going on in tenement buildings). And who cares if these luxe king beds didn't exist back then, I sure as hell don't want to be sleeping in a twin to preserve that I Love Lucy aesthetic either. 

I stayed in one of the king suites, which during the summer are available at such an incredibly discounted rate. It's so worth it to get over your fear of desert heat and have a little vacay in Phoenix/Scottsdale. I'm all about off-season vacationing. This way, too, the pool is practically private to you and your friends. By the by, I only swam in it at night as I'm a sun-shunner. I'll have you know it's lovely at night as is the jacuzzi that's right in front of a waterfall. On that note, I applaud the HVH's landscapers. It's tropical without being over bearing and compliments the pool area just beautifully. The pool is equipped with a bar and sweet sitting areas with lounge chairs and some shading if you gotta be out there in the heat of the day.

More on the room before I exceed the word count in this review. It's large and well-appointed with dresser, desk, Eames style furniture (what else would you expect?). There's a well-priced mini bar and snack sitch, but let me just go on a bit about the martini set! I was told back in the day, people would entertain in their rooms at the HVH and this is yet more homage to that time. The other detail I love about the studio rooms is that each comes with a private patio. It might have been 100 degrees at night, but damned if I didn't enjoy a glass of bubbly & room service out there in the pitch dark. Cabana rooms are poolside, but then you don't get that swanky tub in the middle of the room. The bathroom area is a discussion unto itself. and is more like a bathroom suite. I love it! Design geniuses, I tell you.

I suppose, kittens, that I really am going on too much. I'll be back in October and will update with more accolades. Until then, I shall just yearn for The Ho!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The 60s decor is very well done and looks straight out of Home & Garden.  The room was very cute, the attention to detail leaves you feeling that the people who run the Ho really care.  Prices are very reasonable and if you have the HotelsTonight app on the iPhone I noticed a $75 a night deal that can't be beat.    

The Saturday pool party was a bit packed but their are a ton of seats.  Drink prices were reasonable and they had shot girls that made sure you always were supplied with a beverage.  

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Although I was nervous about staying at a \"theme\" hotel- this property does retro RIGHT! They have a great property that offers a nice pool, great bar, and unexpectedly expansive day spa! The rooms are large and well appointed with flat screens, large soaking tubs, separate shower, balconies, and ample desk space. The smaller details (robes, toiletries, and well-stocked mini bar) do not go unnoticed. The service was excellent and the food was good too! It's be nice if there was faster/better FREE wifi, but that's my only complaint. I hope to be back on a personal vaca soon!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot to say in Old Town!  Unlike other resorts you aren't charged a resort fee and other \"staycation\" fees are minimal like $14 valet parking/$5 for non guests for the day instead of $30 like other places.

No matter if you stay in a regular room or a suite I have found that the customer service at the VH is amazing!  I have stayed at other Old Town Resorts and locals who were there to party at the pool were treated better than me (paying $1300 a night for a suite) but that is not the way they do things at the VH.  Everyone is treated like they are a big spender yet you don't have to be one to get a room here.

Their spa services are always amazing and the employees are very attentive.  They offer beach cruiser rentals and help navigating Old Town to make sure you have the best experience.

The part I love best is that their summer pool parties are guests only which means you don't end up spending $300 for a room only to find out you are fighting for a chair with some local idiot who paid $10 to get into the pool.
Other resorts take note, this is how you do it."}
{"text":"Again, as I said my employer purchased one night stay-cations for all of its employees, and I was the lucky first employee. I had the worst time trying to get my $50 gift card from the spa. I tried a total of three times to retrieve it, and my boyfriend also tried once (bec i was so frustrated) to no avail. Finally, 30 minutes before checking out, I was able to get the card in hand. I wrote the review to hopefully prevent the same experience from happening to my co-workers, but unfortunately nearly every single one of us has had an issue picking up the gift cards, and/or the pool closing early. It has been stressful on my poor boss who paid for everything, and the employees, which kind of defeats the purpose of a \"stay-cation\". I encourage your hotel to find a more seamless way to give out the gift cards, even if its just applying a credit to each room. Its been discouraging to each one of us, and makes it hard for us to want to come back."}
{"text":"Work had an event on the rooftop bar.  It was beautiful and the staff was wonderful.  The bartender was wonderful, the passed appetizers (according to the co-workers were wonderful, but I missed them).  

So why 3 stars?  The actual food in the buffet, was not that great.  I would imagine they spent a pretty penny on this event.  But the spread was just really bland food.  The best part was the garlic bread.  The pasta was over-cooked, which I know happens when it sits in warming pans.  The mushroom burger was not good in any way.  The fruit on the fruit tray was bland too.  Unfortunate.  

The hotel itself is swanky and cool and I have enjoyed hanging out at the hotel bar downstairs in the past.  

The warm service and atmosphere saved this review."}
{"text":"My partner and I flew into town to possibly look for a condo or apartment there.  We had called the concierge to find out that they actually sold units at the Valleyho. The day that I was supposed to catch up with the person in charge of this is when everything went down. Come to find out we had been upgraded to a suite which we thought was for the entire stay. I was on my way out to lunch with clients and was tracked him by a manager saying that I needed to be out of my room in 20 minutes.  I had already purchased groceries and ordered room service for breakfast but I ended up not having time to eat. We had asked if we could just pay for the upgrade because normally we wouldn't sleep in a smaller room that they put us up in.  The two of us had hosted several nights of dinners and drinks for clients friends and family and spend tons of money at this resort.  They took off around $150 for the inconvenience.   For this caliber of the hotel and they're amazing staff we just felt slighted and how this was handled.   If we would've been informed that we are only staying in that certain room a few nights this wouldn't of been such a shock.  However we were not home and I had to throw all my groceries out plus room service because the other room had no fridge.   We were recommended this hotel by many patrons who are furious about what happened and how it happened."}
{"text":"If you are a drunk twenty something, this place is for you. Cool throw back hotel...pretty cool rooms..but that would about it. Was pulling in into the self park parking lot upon arrival and was greeted by intoxicated young woman who thought it would be cute to flash me. Really? I am a female who likes men, so seeing her bare a** did nothing for me. Had I not been driving, and had she not taken off running, I probably would have cornered her drunk a** and knocked some sense into her, mom style. Check in went smoothly and room was cool and funky with nice patio area. Too bad it was too hot to enjoy it...or the pool! This hotel caters to the young Scottsdale crowd so their pool party and alcohol sales is where their focus is, obviously.  The pool was packed with \"that\" crowd and the music was blaring. Actually enjoyed the music from the room, so no real issue with that. My issue is that if I wanted to enjoy the pool, I would be in the middle of a bunch of drunk kids.....and would I really get into a pool that was packed with a bunch of people with no room to spare? Nope, sure wouldn't. Drinks in bar WAY overpriced. $11.00 (didn't know until we got our tab) for a a weak malibu and ginger ale? Really? Yes, really. $44.00 (before tip) dollars later, I was over everything cool and funky so off we went to the valet. They have a contract with a sedan service so no cabs. That's fine, so we wait...and wait. While we are \"next\" so are the couple who they decide to give our car to! When I complain, we are told they \"probably\" reserved it! Uh, no they sure didn't.. as I was standing right there when they waltzed out the door and into our car without even having a conversation with the valet as he is leading them into the car! The next car finally came around about 10 minutes later and we had to open our own doors and weren't even acknowledged by the valets. No tip for them, jerks! After a great night out, we returned, climbed into bed...and no top sheet. What? Top sheets are only give upon request, as they do it \"european style\"...well, I am not in Europe...and if I actually believed they washed each duvet cover after each guest, I might be ok with it, but I don't believe it. We called to request a top sheet and they first brought a duvet cover in error, then a torn sheet, and then a good sheet. A good nights sleep at last! The hotel did comp our breakfast for some of the issues we had, so I will give them points for that... but please...spare me the \"Come back and see us in the non summer months!\" I shouldn't  have to come back to experience what I should have had in the first place."}
{"text":"Man, this place has got style and history going for it. It's been refurbished, but righteously, so all those classic mid-century touches (think: clean lines, low-rise, fab colors) still are present and accounted for.

Back in the '50s, this was evidently the \"in\" spot for the well-heeled set. Imagine Bing Crosby and Tony Curtis. Ted Williams and Roy Rogers. Janet Leigh. They were all here in full swing, like something out of a Shag (http://www.shag.com/gallery.html) painting.

When I popped in last night, the place was sadly not in motion (it was a Tuesday night), but you could still get a sense of the vibe. Café Zuzu is their bar, complete with retro booths and counter-style seating, and there's seating by the o-shaped pool. Trader Vic's is also connected to the hotel, and while you might not spot Harry Belafonte (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AjovHGK-TA) hanging around, I can see how the tiki appeal works its way in (I think the Scorpion Bowls and Navy Grogs help with that as well!).

I'm actually staying at the serene Firesky ( which is itself so far fantastic) during my visit to Old Town Scottsdale, but I gotta say, I'm definitely hip to the Ho next time around!"}
{"text":"I had a trip booked for Miami and had to pull it last minute - due to board meeting. A board that I belongs to, a board filled with some of the muckety-mucks of the Valley and the City and everywhere in between. Believe it or not, I do work for a (modest) living, and I didn't want to let my vacation interfere with work. Then this stay came along.

I was taken by surprise with this hotel. It's no Park Hyatt Tokyo, but it's swanky in its own ways. Its mid century Americana modern is what it is known for, but it goes beyond that. It has a post modern sensibility that made this place pop.

Palm trees. A chic pool party scene. Nice drinks served at pool side. Two hot tubs. And finally, a two piece only bathing suit scene like you'd see in Europe. I have a pet peeve with one piece. It felt so great grandma-ish. Years of in and out of Europe made me realize that unless you are age 90 or above, you don't wear 1 piece suit. This pool obviously post no such mandate, it just seems to have more patrons donning two piece. Suits me, I only packed two piece bathing suit.

If lounging by the pool gets too hot, switch over to the balcony, oversized yet private enough to do what you please. 

If being with people seemed too exhausting, there is a quiet pool and a lap pool. Both make wonderful exercise opportunity if you are in need of heeling of a bad knee (which I was). 

The rooms are exceptionally large. A separate shower and soaking tub. Good amenities. No bugs whatsoever. Considering this is a 90 some degree weather, not bad. In the evening, the lush landscape does bring down the heat down a notch. Very comfortable if you leave your balcony door open. 

We arrived amidst a storm up in San Francisco. Only two hours away, in this hotel, we seemed to have been transported to the sunny, yet hurricane free, Miami. Occasionally, while soaking in the tub, I look up, only palm trees, and blue sky. Not one single cloud in the sky. At 9:30 pm I was in bed.  There I laid with eyes closed, every single part of my body relaxed. My mind wandered to Miami mid 90s, where I had been in and out of often, with a man 8 years senior than I, who worked for the U.S. embassy in a Caribbean country. While this was not Miami, this property gives that same kind of vibe, with every piece of the decor done just so to impress. 

I was bewildered and enchanted. I was not seeking nostalgia, but nostalgia found me. Here, I was once again this 22 year old wild eyed girl fallen in love for the first time."}
{"text":"What a neat hotel.   They've totally remodeled this old place and it's like a brand new hotel.  Room was very cozy and had all the amentities you need.  Stylish everything here.  The pool turns into a dance club on the weekends and gets pretty loud.  I enjoyed my stay here.  Next time I want to try the restaurant."}
{"text":"First, I would like to start by saying that I LOVE this hotel. Yep... that's right. I LOVE this hotel. I live down the street, and I frequent this hotel, the pool, and the bar at least once or twice a month during the summer. I also visit the VH Spa at least a few times a year as well, and I am frequently treating my mother/sister/friends to Spa days here for a treat/gift.

So, why the 2 star review? I had a really poor experience this last weekend, and I am utterly disappointed at how management responded. Here is the situation:

As I mentioned, I bring people to the Spa here quite often. I am a Maid-of-Honor in an upcoming wedding, and as a part of the low-key \"Bachelorette Weekend\" I booked Spa services for all the bridesmaids and the bride. This was ~$700 for the services. We also were spending time out at the pool, ordering a few drinks here and there. ~$300 is probably around what we collectively spent at the pool bar. 

We had about an hour and a half to kill before our spa services, so we went to the pool to catch some rays. About 15 minutes before our services, we gathered our items, left our bar tab open and went to head upstairs for our treatments. On the way there is where we had our issue. 

**TO BE CLEAR, there were 5 of us girls. As we grabbed our items to head straight to the spa, 3 of the girls put all their clothes back on over their wet swimsuits, and myself and another girl just put our shorts/skirt back on and were carrying our tops. Myself and the other girl had not seen any signs requesting that shirts be worn at all times in the lobby or else we would have absolutely covered to their request. We were 100% in the wrong here, we just weren't aware of it at this time. We were in no way trying to break any rules or ruffle any feathers. We were simply walking from the pool door to the stairs straight through. 

As we approached the stairs, we were walking past the concierge desk when a lady with short spiky blonde/white/gray (not sure) hair scolded us. She was incredibly rude in her approach to ask us to put our shirts on. When we said \"Sorry, we didn't realize...\" she interrupted and said \"There is a sign that says it RIGHT outside\"..... Okay........ It was clear we didn't SEE the sign, and had we seen it, we would have covered up. We really didn't appreciate being scolded like children. Perhaps the sign needs to be in a more visible place? There are lots of signs around announcing a wedding, perhaps when we were walking in, we assumed the sign by the door was another announcement sign like the one by the pool area? Regardless, we all felt her approach was unnecessarily rude and unacceptable to the situation. 

So we went upstairs and had our services. Jennifer was my masseuse and she was AMAZING. The girls at the spa desk were very helpful and kind as well. Unfortunately, during my treatments, I found it hard to relax because I was very upset and perturbed by the way we were treated. 

After our services concluded and we headed back down to the pool (fully covered), I went to the front desk and asked to speak to a manager. The gentleman at the front desk said he was a manager. When I explained to him that I felt the way I was approached in the situation was unacceptable, he basically reiterated the \"Well, there is a sign posted...\" line and made no effort in finding a balance with me. I kindly and calmly stated back, \"I understand NOW that there is a sign posted. I still have not seen this sign, but I understand that its there, and I recognize that I am in the wrong. I am not denying in anyway that I was in the wrong... but there is a right way and a wrong way to approach a customer, and she chose a very rude, abrasive, and confrontational way of approaching the situation. And THAT is my issue.\" To that he said \"So maybe she needs to soften her approach, and that is a conversation we will have to have with her.\" He did not say this is any comforting manner. Just simply stated that perhaps a conversation with her is in order. No apology for her behavior, nothing. 

I left that conversation feeling about exactly the same as when I started it. Like I never want to return to this hotel. Incredibly bummed at the lack of care and service for the people who frequent their Spa, pool, and bar. Incredibly bummed at their tactless behavior in approaching a customer. To be honest, embarrassed at the way we were verbally and loudly (enough for people around us to hear) attacked by the concierge woman. 

There are plenty of other pools/spas/bars in Old Town Scottsdale that I can frequent. I have always CHOSEN to frequent this one. I have CHOSEN to utilize their Spa and bring family and friends. I have CHOSEN to use their pool (and purchase food and drinks) in their \"down season\" when there is not many people around. I am not someone who comes once a year. I am here year round. I will no longer CHOOSE the Valley Ho. And that is why they are receiving a 2 star review."}
{"text":"I'll keep this one short and sweet for the most part:

Stayed here some time back for a tennis tournament, and was (and still am) a big fan of this property. Our room was large and extremely comfortable-- had a large bathroom and I remember the beds being just SO amazing, topped with great linens, too. Might sound ridiculous, but little details like the blue mood light(s) in the room are quite cool and add to the semi-retro tone. 
I loved the feel of the place as a whole; as Isabella J. said, it's like you are taken back to another era. This is meant in the best way possible, it really was so neat. 
If I'm in Scottsdale again near this area, I'll definitely be checking in."}
{"text":"I stayed at this place for my brother's bachelor party weekend and it was a great alternative to Vegas. The pool area was beautiful and wasn't crawling with douchebags. Other guests nextdoor and by the pool were very nice. The rooms were clean and had spacious balconies. I wasn't a fan of the bathroom setup, though. There wasn't a door to the bathroom or the toilet, just 2 sliders, which didn't allow for much privacy. I can't speak for every room layout, though, because it seemed that there were other room layouts that may have had better features (the room across the courtyard from us has a jacuzzi in the middle of the room ... So jealous). 

The decor is a little retro. There's a lot of turquoise and orange, plus some interesting landscaping choices outside. One of our guys cut his toe open pretty badly on one of the many little metal rods that jutted out from the sidewalls that line the walkways. Beautiful palm trees and orange chaises make you almost feel like you were in Miami for a moment. 

The hotel had golf cart services, which was a nice feature all around Scottsdale, allowing us to get quick rides to and from Whiskey Row and restaurants nearby. Location was a key factor at the Valley Ho. We were able to walk to the bars without it being an inconvenience, and it was right next to a Circle K for basic necessities. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good time during spring break, but I wouldn't recommend it to families. It's a perfect place for the mid-twenties to late thirties crowd who want to enjoy themselves, hear some good music throughout the night, and see some great scenery."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed at the Valley Ho for 2 nights and loved it.  The staff was great.  The property is well cared for. We were there Monday-Wednesday so I can't speak for the weekend crowd but everyone from guests to bartenders and servers were nice and having Fun!
We stayed in a Cabana Suite and grabbed carry out for several meals just because it was so relaxing to sit on the patio with a bottle of wine and eat. 
There is a nice Circle K across the street for snacks, beer...etc. 
They have some decent drink specials at the pool bar on weekdays and a nice Happy Hour at ZuZu (the restaurant on site) so you do not feel like you are getting ripped off every time you order a drink. 
Great place for couples and adults!"}
{"text":"I love the mid-century modern aesthetic so I naturally loved my stay here. 

The hotel is gorgeous, and straight out of a Mad Men episode. The service was great-courteous and beyond attentive. Their system of using text-messages to communicate with guests is oh so convenient. Answers were just a quick text away. I also love that It's walking distance to great food, bars, and galleries. 

I took advantage of their anniversary rate and couldn't have been happier. Such a fun stay for a great reasonable price."}
{"text":"As a business traveler, I find the \"cookie cutter\" hotels can get old fast.  So, it was a delight to stay at Hotel Valley Ho!  The original mid-century architecture, combined with modern renovations and amenities, makes the Valley Ho unique.  The grounds are green and lush - an oasis in the desert.  Rooms are really large and very retro - even had martini glasses and a shaker!  I had breakfast outdoors twice, and the food was terrific. The pool areas are very relaxing with plenty of cozy outdoor furniture. The staff was welcoming and helpful. I'll go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Fun landmark resort from the Rat Pack days that has been restored with a lot of love. Good spa, good bar, good breakfast, good pool, good rooms, and walking distance to the heart of Old Town with a trolley stop right out front. Emphasis is on relaxing and having a good time over some of the more buttoned-down resorts in the area, very good for couples. 

Find an hour to do the architectural tour of the resort, you'll learn a few things. One star off because, as others note, the pool party crowd attracted by the DJ on summer weekends is...uh...not consistent with the rest of the experience. It's a good time to spend the afternoon in town and have a late dinner out to avoid that whole...situation."}
{"text":"Great hotel in a perfect location; nice rooms, fun pool and a very friendly staff.  Go see Travis in the lounge, makes a solid drink and garnishes it with some dry wit."}
{"text":"Great 50's mid century modern place and decor, great employees, I loved the room and pool! It can be expensive, but the night we were there it was 159 for the night, BUT we got a 50 dollar credit at Trader Vic's next door! We love that Trader Vic's and the 50 bucks helped! ZAZZ!"}
{"text":"Oooooh yes, the many memories of the Hotel Valley Ho afternoons by the pool and occasional overnights while living in Scottsdale.  I have that much more appreciation for this place because I stayed there when it was in it's original state, before the remodel which took place in 2005 if I remember correct. Also of note: It was supposedly one of Scottsdale's first premier destinations of the stars that wanted a break from the Hollywood scene in the '50 and '60s. 
 The Ho's restaurant/lounge, Cafe Zuzu is great to enjoy high-end American food, and at night is a cool/chic place to lounge and have a drink.   Definitely has a modern-deco bedrock them to it, which is fresh, and the pool area is large enough to where you don't feel cramped like, say the Mondrian used to feel like. Also of note, is that' it's right in the center of OldTown Scottsdale, so you are within walking distance to many restaurants and clubs, and 5 minute walk to Fashion Square Mall if you want to get your shop on.
Spent my last few days in AZ at the Valley Ho before moving back to San Diego in Feb of 2010 and it was the most memorable experience I've  had at a hotel/pool. We'll just say it involved my best friend and I, and a girl traveling on business that we met poolside. I'll just say that the stand-up marble showers are great!  :]"}
{"text":"My friend and I was recommended by another friend of ours to meet there for drinks and appatizers. What a great choice... While waiting for our friend to show up, we went to the front desk and asked for pool access to check it out. They kindly accepted our request. This is a great place to stay, relax and pamper yourself. They have multiple pools, hot tubs and bungalows with a pool bar, waiteress included. The drinks, food and service was excellent... Be prepared to pay up for all these services, but would make an awesome romantic vacation."}
{"text":"1st thought as we drove up to this hotel, flintstones meets Brady bunch. After a great dinner and great nights sleep at this wonderful place, we were looking for names and brands of amenities to order for our home. Ordered 4 pillows already. Zuzu restaurant was awesome, food and service.... perfect. Room is cool and relaxing. A note to valley ho, the bloody buddy mix , in the fridge, is awesome stuff. Thank you all, we'll be back, often."}
{"text":"Beautifully hotel and great lounge.  Nice place to grab a drink"}
{"text":"This is a really fun hotel that has been designed well and offers plenty of amenities with a friendly staff. The valet was very helpful and easy to deal with upon arrival and checkout. Our bell hop was great: very knowledgeable about the hotel history and layout, and more then willing to help get us completely situated into our room. The design is a throwback, contemporary retro theme that makes you feel like you are kind of in another time or on an island resort. It's fun, and hip, and a little quirky, but it makes you feel equally ready to party or lay around on the numerous loungers at the pool, in your room, or on a balcony. We stayed in the studio king and it was perfect for a couple. It had a ton of space but the privacy is minimal in the room so a group of friends may do better in a suite. The layout and all of the amenities and counter space was incredible, and the stand alone bath tub in the center was a nice touch. I would give the Valley Ho five stars if not for a few small complaints. One, the AC didn't cool the room efficiently enough, two, there wasn't a separate stereo with mp3 hookup (just the TV), and three, the fridge was TINY! Even if I took out the beverages from the mini bar there still wasn't much room and it wasn't very cold. I had to chill the champagne on ice. These caveats are small however, and overall I would recommend this hotel very highly for a comfortable, stylish, and fun stay in a perfect location to enjoy downtown Scottsdale."}
{"text":"How does this place not have all 5 stars? I do not understand. First, the decor is amazing. I love the way they kept the 1950s style. They even play 50s music in the lobby.

The room was incredibly spacious. It seemed like they had thought of everything. Free bath crystals, and mood lighting on the tub..separate vanity area with mirror..bowl sink..toilet in a separate room..separate shower and tub...even a back patio with a reclining chair and table, completely private.

Everyone who works here was friendly. 2 gorgeously landscaped pools. 2 hot tubs. 

I was there for modeling work--my room and travel expenses were paid for. Luckily, I didn't have to work too hard, so I had time to explore the downtown area within walking distance. The hotel is right next to the arts district, and there were tons of shops and restaurants.

I'd live here if I could!"}
{"text":"Lovely hotel with a hip vibe. Love how they styled it. The place is happening! I think they have great service! The restaurants are good and the pool is the best."}
{"text":"I travel a lot for business and a friend suggested here and it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had in my 25 years of traveling. So many things were a nightmare! I'm in town on business and pleasure with my dogs and this hotel is supposed to be dog friendly. I called to see if I could get early check in and they said yes at 2. So I came at 2. They said it wasn't ready which was fine I figured I would sit in the bar and have a drink. I asked the front desk guy named Ty I could sit in the bar area not once but twice he said yes. So I sat in the bar area I got served a drink about three employees came over and patted the dogs not one person said you can't have dogs here and then a woman came up to me and told me I couldn't have the dogs in the bar and I was put outside and she was extremely rude when she could've been nice. I went outside with the dogs and I had to move again and sit in the heat for two hours till Room was ready. Then the next day I was going to stay again and I was treated SO rudely by Luella I decided to go elsewhere. The only amazing people at this hotel are the waitress Courtney and Kate. The valet and bell desk men Tim, Jeremy, Alex, Keith. Literally everyone else you could tell they hated their jobs they hated their lives and they wanted to take their misery out on everybody else don't stay at this hotel if you're trying to go on vacation I'll just make your time worse! Oh and the hotel decided to hold a $2000 charge on one of my card that won't be released for seven business days that they never forgot to mention and they couldn't give me the reason why!"}
{"text":"I had my Bachelorette party here and it was amazing the staff was wonderful and made sure we all were well taken care of. The food was fabulous. Sat morning we headed over to the pool we had a VIP section and the staff again was awesome even being as busy as they were I felt like we were the only people there! All my girl loved the place I just can't say enough it's so modern yet still has a 50's feel to it can't wait to go again and enjoy my birthday there at the end of the month!!"}
{"text":"This has become my favorite \"Staycation\" resort.  It's so cute, comfy, and beautifully designed.   I LOVE the botanical amenities.   It's close to everything and has a great vibe.  My out-of-town friends love it as well.  Stay in the tower if you can."}
{"text":"I had a fabulous stay here. I tried to book the Firesky but it was sold out, so a co-worker suggested the Valley Ho. I had no idea it was a palace of retro funkiness. Nish said it was a Shag painting come to life, and I couldn't agree more. I had a moonlight swim, a waffle at the breakfast bar, and an all-around swank time. It was swell!"}
{"text":"Another stylish and swanky hotel in Scottsdale. Easy to find, you have to valet your car. Bye, bye independence. Hello $20 tip. 

The lobby is beyond prestige. You walk in and instantly feel 20 points hipper. Too bad nobody you know is there to see you. 

The rooms are lovely and modern with the best smelling shampoo and soap - ever. 

You think you hit the jackpot. Only, after dinner (we ate at the nearby Trader Vic's - yum!) and too-many-drinks, you stumble back to your room to pass out. Only there's a party next door that intends to keep you awake the entire night. 

So, you step outside on the patio and listen to their conversation. You are only slightly amused, although you are ever-so reminded that you are beat and in dire need of Z's. Too bad Party Boy and his Peeps have no shame in keeping you awake with them. 

Exhausted, you finally fade into slumber around dawn. The bed is comfy; you don't want to leave it. But, alas, you must due to an evil thing called Check Out. On your way, you grab the sweet smellin' shower goods. Damnit, you should grab the TV and coffee maker, too. It's the least the hotel owes you for putting you next to the loudest hotel guests ever. 

Oh well. Life goes on, and you never have to go back. That, my friend, is called independence."}
{"text":"Stepping into the Hotel Valley Ho, I was immediately reminded of one of my favorite things: Mad Men. It's chic. It's retro. It's gorgeous!

I can just picture Don Draper stopping by the lounge for a stiff drink, or Joan and Roger slipping away into one of the 60's styled rooms for a little rendezvous. I half-expected to see Betty sulking by the pool while her kids splished and splashed in the massive thing.

We stayed just one night as we were in town for a wedding, and I found myself not wanting to leave the room! In fact, we actually left the shindig a little early so we could come back, make cocktails and watch bad tv. It was splendid.

I only have two complaints about the room: the toiletries smelled bad and for some reason, our bathtub drain was broken. Of course, smell is preference and I'm certain that had we been staying for more than one night and actually complained that the tub would have been taken care of. The customer service was great!

Another note: Valet parking is $14 per night (and again, the customer service is wonderful), but you CAN park on Main Street which is just a short walk away. 

I will definitely stay at the Valley Ho again, but next time I'll remember to bring my own lotion and a wiggle skirt."}
{"text":"Totally overpriced a nd over hyped. Much better hotels for cheaper in same area. Old hotel just remodeled I would choose another."}
{"text":"Let me start with the good parts:

Nanci from the pool was great, some of the best service I have EVER gotten.  Lindsay from the restaurant was awesome.  Even though I spilled my champagne Lindsay still, with a smile got me another one faster than the first.  The bellman Mike was awesome and accommodating.  Everything we needed he got within an instant.  

Here is why it's unlikely I will ever be back:

The hotel had a lavish perception but cheap approach.  They claim to be \"pet friendly\" but watch out, if your dog barks because of insanely out of control noise in the hallway between other rooms then you're going to get multiple calls at breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Not only that, they actually told me to come back to my room and try to calm them down.  Fine, we did this a few times.  The first time they were barking was because of housekeeping going up and down the hallway with those noisy carts that sound like a tornados approaching.  

The next few times I got a call was because of the bigots between rooms on each side of mine making noise in the hallway as they left the doors to two different rooms wide open.  They were screaming, laughing, joking and cussing like a bunch of high school kids.  Naturally my dogs would react to this level of noise by barking.  I call them bigots because we heard and saw the rhetoric when me and my friends were all hanging in the cabana most of the day, they were making comments, and some of them even stopped everything, turned towards my cabana and just looked like they have never seen two men give each other the slightest bit of affection ever.  Later that night I'm getting calls at dinner because of a \"noise complaint\" from the dogs.  They didn't even BOTHER to go to my room to see on each side of the room was the real noise CAUSING them to bark.   

My disappointment is stemmed from the blatant disregard this hotel had in investigating the matter before calling me multiple times, interrupting my meals and really putting a damper on my ability to enjoy this place.  I won't be back since it emanates bigotry and that seems to be why the \"complaints\" about my dogs even started.  If someone has a problem with our lifestyle well that's just too bad.  If the hotel won't do more to promote tolerance and diversity, then guess what, this is the kind of irrefutable madness people can and will do to kill a good time.  

Hotel Valley Ho is on my blacklist and it would really take a lot of convincing to even re-consider it again in the future."}
{"text":"Attention Mid-Century Modern fans, fanatics, and the like.  Yes, this includes me.  I hosted my husband's surprise birthday party here and the service, the hospitality, the food, just everything was excellent.  From the beginning from submitting the RFP to the very end: the catering team, (special shout out to Allison) made every step of the way painless and enjoyable.  We hosted our party at the OHasis Pool.  We hired outside live music which was not a problem for the hotel and the hotel provided the power hook up next to the pool for the music entertainment with no issues.  Food options were set out beautifully for self-serve and were all high quality and with beautiful presentation.  Certainly wedding or reception-grade if you are researching that option.  This hotel truly is a gift for the mid-century modern lover since the furnishings and décor all represent the classic styles with a new perspective.  We hired a Frank Sinatra impersonator for entertainment and that really made the evening just have that extra pop!  Do book your next event there and the best is most certainly yet to come!"}
{"text":"First room they gave me smelled strongly of musty wet towels and chlorine.  When I got in to my new room, there was a cockroach on the vanity.  The AC made a squeaky ticking sound that made it impossible to sleep.  Here's the kicker.  Woke up to about a dozen little WORMS all over the floor, some still alive.  Disgusting.  They offered me free breakfast.  After some more discussion they comped the room.  On a positive note, I love the mid century aesthetic."}
{"text":"I love this hotel-great atmosphere and friendly/professional staff. The rooms are amazing-I love the contemporary/nostalgic 1950's design. The restaurant/bar are excellent along with the pool, spa. The list goes on. This is a great place for a romantic getaway or a getaway with friends."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time at Hotel Valley Ho! From the room to the pool to the restaurant to the excellent customer service, it was a perfect choice and experience!"}
{"text":"Went there for a wedding and we were not allowed to celebrate after to ceremony. Over $30K spent with such poor treatment. Do not go here, especially with any events."}
{"text":"Cool boutique spot hidden amongst the old town of Scottsdale, Arizona.  Poolside DJ and a pool where you never see anyone leave to go to the restroom????? But the drinks sure floooooooow (Petri Dish with heavy Chlorination)  the resort is hip minus the hipster and cool in a hot setting."}
{"text":"As noted in my prior review from over a year ago, when we returned to Scottsdale, we stayed at the Valley Ho. We were there over Thanksgiving and got an incredible deal as the hotel was offering a free night after paying for three. We stayed in a second floor king suite overlooking the pool. Again, the room was great - comfy bed/bedding and love the separate shower and tub. The extra large balcony had a table with chairs and an oversized comfy lounger for soaking in some sun. 

We noticed a great daily offering at the Spa for reduced massages and decided to take advantage. The spa experience was on par with other resorts we have tried in the valley. But the best part of the spa/fitness facility is the gym. Great, great, great hotel gym. Lots of cardio options and you can get a decent lifting session in too. 

Cafe Zu Zu on the property offers great options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The service is great. We popped in for lunch on Thanksgiving and requested an item not listed on the special menu but from the regular lunch menu - no problem! They delivered without any attitude about it (try to spicy chicken salad salad!!) We also had Thanksgiving dinner - and for $27 were pleased with our decision. The ingredients and food quality are always excellent. Lots of flavor and time spent on preparation. Make time for happy hour - $3 martinis! 

We got to enjoy the pool throughout our stay and the guys taking care of us were great. We had water as soon as we sat down every time - including when we were just popping in for a quick hot tub soak. 

Another great advantage of this hotel is it's prime location. We walked to Fashion Square and many restaurants in Old Town. We also found a local high school with great tennis courts (short drive away). 

Another great experience at this hotel will keep us coming back. No complaints!"}
{"text":"We have a hotel reservation coming up.  It's 8:40pm right now. I just tried to call them with a question about our reservation and it goes to voice mail. No option to hold

Just voice mail!!

I'm amazed at a top hotel in Scottsdale that charges $300+ a night doesn't have the staff to take phone calls.   

I mean they are losing out on new reservations too. 

Why not have an 3rd party answering service that can handle calls. 

I tried 3 different numbers, and all go to the same voice mail."}
{"text":"The hotel has a cool vibe. Service is very good, especially at the pool. If you are used to a luxury vacation, however, this isn't the place. Our stay was great and our Tower Suite room was spacious and clean. The location is excellent as you can walk into old scottsdale. The on site restaurant, Zuzu, is very good. Overall, we enjoyed our stay but just a little less upscale than we are used to (and a little less upscale than I would have thought from the promotional video). If you are up for a fun weekend away with friends, then this is the place. If you are looking to be pampered in a romantic setting, then probably not the best choice."}
{"text":"The room was great.  No problem there, however, this is a party hotel.  They encourage it with their local activities as well as providing guest services.  It was very crowded and loud.  We had to get up at 4 in the morning, open the slider door to the courtyard and suggest that some people still up and talking loud in the courtyard to please be quiet.  Fortunately, they did and the situation did not escalate, but we were awakened at least 3 times during the night for noise.  So, if you want to party, it's a great place, but for others, it can be less peaceful."}
{"text":"I had a facial with Melissa at the spa and she was FABULOUS! Best facial I have ever had. She was very thorough, gentle, and kept a relaxing environment yet talked enough to make it fun! I have chronically chapped lips and she introduced me to a great lip product to help. If and when I return to the spa, I will absolutely request her."}
{"text":"what a wonderful gem the valley ho is.  built in the 50's this landmark was a work in progress for several years till it finally reopened in december '05. they say the remodel was 18 months, but i could have sworn this place was downtrodden for years before the remodel. but anyways, the place is hot now.

if the valley ho was in Phoenix i could see myself here often, but being in scottsdale and me being a proud cenpho spokesperson, i don't know how often i will be tempted by the awesome decor and styling of this retro redux boutique hotel. 

i took the time to walk around the grounds and check out the architecture and groundskeeping. everything was beautiful. i didn't want to just write a review on an awesome saturday at the pool and gloss over the appearance of the hotel as a whole..this place is spectacular. 

so the reason i was at the Valley Ho? well if was a friends birthday and she was throwing a big bash with her friend Luis. sort of a double birthday thing. a couple rooms had been acquired and two cabanas by the pool.  we stocked up one of the rooms with drinks and spent the whole day lounging by the pool. which was beautiful. people watching was fun, there was several scottsdale perverts with cameras on hand taking pictures of the younger women in bathing suits, and then there was the flock of women who had been \"left\" at the valley ho as their rich businessmen husbands were out traveling or doing business...

the cabana next to us had a lovely group of women out from Orange County for their friends bachelorette party. very happy group of people to be next to. and made great neighbors for the day

the pool staff was somewhat attentive, but competent and made sure the cabanas were serviced and people were happy. the pool bar was affordable and busy without too long of a delay on getting drinks.


the rooms of the hotel have a real modern retro feel from the large bathrooms with color changing frosted glass to the cabinetry and furniture. one of the rooms had a spectacular patio view of the pool and i was able to grab a picture of it lit up against the darkness of the night. i sat out on the patio for a good hour just enjoying the night sky and randomly viewable stars in the sky. great experience over all. definitely memorable and i doubt i will forget it any time soon."}
{"text":"This is definitely my go to spot when it comes to staycations. Hotel Valley Ho has a vibe unlike any other and I enjoy being able to unwind here after a long stressful week. They have multiple pools, AMAZING happy hour at Cafe Zuzu and the most trendy events year-round. The cherry on top is that they're PET FRIENDLY!!! I never have to worry about finding a sitter for my dog as he comes with me, and sometimes enjoys the staycation more than I do."}
