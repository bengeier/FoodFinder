{"text":"T bone steak special on fridays is my absolute favorite!! Tastes amazing along with a baked potatoe and salad. Brandi our waitress was very attentive as well."}
{"text":"We have been going to the rib crib in all its locations and names for the last 35 years! The sauce isn't the usual sweet sauce of most rib places but a great hearty thick beefy sauce! Would recommend the chicken and extra quart of sauce and takeout not eat in."}
{"text":"Ribs were cooked perfect. They didnt fall right off they had a little pull just like they should. Only complaint the sauce. I hate tomato based sauce next time bringing my own."}
{"text":"Really nice staff but worst ribs I've ever had! Chevy meat, flavorless thick tomato sauce for the ribs.. Didn't even taste like BBQ. I should have just grabbed little Ceasars $5 pizza instead of wasting $20 on half a slab, fries and a coke."}
{"text":"If you are allergic to smoke, this is a SMOKING establishment (as in cigarettes).  Food was good and portions large.  Ordered the prime rib sub and pulled pork sandwich both were good and large.  Fresh cut fries were well cooked.  I would have given this a 3 1/2 if available but can't go to 4 star, we were un-aware this facility permitted cigarette smoking  and there was not a separate room to escape the smoke."}
{"text":"We always order chicken salads. They are the absolute best around! Pulled pork is also delicious!! Never had a bad meal!"}
