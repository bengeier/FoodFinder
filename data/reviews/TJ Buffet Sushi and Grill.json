{"text":"Wow just wow!  Awesome Chinese Buffett. So glad there is one back in the North Hills. The food was amazing and the place is clean. Reminds me of good buffets from long ago. There is a sushi selection but if you want a giant selection of sushi I would go elsewhere (well, I wouldn't but you can). Great buffet! Good selection and the quality to match. The reviews posted below 4 stars really must have been expecting some yuppy sushi joint."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Actually still here eating for lunch. Everything is fresh, delicious. This is the best food this location has ever put out. I think this location has been a dozen different Asian places in the past 10 years. This one is finally a winner."}
{"text":"This was without a doubt the worst chinese food I have ever eaten. I am certainly not looking for great quality when I eat chinese food, especially at a buffet, but I found much of this food to be inedible. They claim to have a large selection of food but unless you like seafood and various dumplings, the pickings are slim. Most of the food that I had was over-cooked, didn't look appetizing, and didn't look or taste fresh. The green beans, sesame chicken, fried rice, and crab legs were incredibly over-cooked. The crab rangoons (normally a favorite of mine) tasted like they only had cream cheese in them. The chicken teriyaki was on the mushy side. The chow mein tasted like it had toilet bowl cleaner in it (that is immediatly what popped into my head when I tried it and I can figure out what ingredient would make it taste like that). I didn't try the grill or the sushi but my husband said the sushi was decent (where my second star came from). On thebplus side, the sercice was good, it appeared clean, and the food and dining areas were spacious. I would not reccommend this restaurant and I will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"I've been here several times afterwards and have to say that the quality isn't as nice. Several dishes have been removed, a lot of favorites are no longer present. I haven't seen eel since. While their sesame chicken is often crunchy and warm, most other items are just lukewarm, specifically the broccoli. I'm mostly disappointed that they've stopped serving a lot of dishes people enjoyed. That being said, I'm sure if they had more options set out they could justify the higher prices that they want to put out"}
{"text":"The sushi selection was slim to none. Food was not cooked. Tokyo-the place before there was way better. For a sushi lover like myself this place was highly disappointing. If you're looking for a sushi buffet do NOT go here."}
{"text":"I was extremely sad to see Tokyo Sushi close but was happy again when I saw a new buffet would be taking it's place.

I stopped by for lunch the week they opened and I can say that the price for the buffet was very reasonably priced ($7.99 I believe). I was promptly seated and a server was at my table immediately. I was however surprised when she told me they did not have hot green tea...

The selection was that of a normal Chinese/Japanese buffet with 1 or 2 items that allow them to also consider themselves Mongolian. One of these items was a hunk of meat, which I believe was ham. The other was some type of bbq which I did not partake in. 

The food was good but nothing to go home and brag about. I also took into consideration that it was their first week being open so they may have a few kinks to work out. 

All in all the service was excellent, the food was ok and the price was outstanding so how can you really complain? I will give this place another go around once they have been open for a while and update my review if anything has changed."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on a Monday. I've been wanting to try this place for a while since they have all you can eat sushi (their was also some confusing previously online wether or not it was still open). 

Upon arrival we were immediately seated and the waitress took our drinks. Then you can hit the buffet, but they don't tell you that lol. So we waited for a little then went. 

Since it was slow, the food was a little cold (bourbon chicken and general tsos). When I went for a second plate they had fresh food out so I got more. Decent sushi selection but it was all unlabeled so you have to guess what kind you're eating, not a big deal if you eat sushi a lot. 

The bill for me and my gf was less than $21. Pretty cheap for a buffet! All and all I wouldn't make a special trip here but if I was nearby and hungry I'd stop in again."}
{"text":"The best food and service. We mentioned it was my sons birthday they sang him happy birthday and brought him a cake. I highly recommend this to eat!"}
{"text":"Save yourself, your children and your loved ones.  If you have a dog, stay home and eat dog s*#t.  Seriously.  The \"sushi\" here literally looked like sushi someone s*#t out and put on a platter.  Even the two suspicious men making them were LOLing the whole time, probably mumbling \"hahah these f_ck#?s think this is sushi, I put my poo in here.\"  

Don't eat here. SERIOUSLY DONT DO IT!!

Worst food experience of my life."}
{"text":"I am a regular, but i was highly disappointed today. As I approached the front door, an Asian woman held her hand up and blurted out \"CROSED!\"

That is not the proper way to greet and apologize to a loyal patron.

\"I am sorry, sir, but we are closed.\" - that works

Put a sign up. Don't hide behind broken English and tell me to take my business elsewhere.

I am not racist. I am Asian myself.

Politeness is key."}
{"text":"I'd say this place is about par for the course as far as Chinese buffets go. It's got all your standard offerings and a selection of sushi. The food was ok. The crab Rangoon had a bit too much cream cheese rather than seafood filling, but it wasn't terrible. The sesame chicken just tasted like breaded chicken with a bland Asian sauce on it and a few sesame seeds, but again wasn't terrible. The egg roll was halfway decent, but not very crispy, as I feel egg rolls should be. The egg drop soup was ok, but didn't have enough egg. It tasted like broth with a few pieces of egg in it. The sushi was ok, but kind of bland. The only thing I got that I really didn't like was the cheesy potato; the potato itself had a weird taste and didn't even taste like a potato, and the topping on it just tasted kind of weird, like it didn't belong on top of a baked potato. I do have to say, however, that the staff I've encountered in the two times I've been here were polite to me; they were attentive and receptive to my needs as a customer. Overall, I'd say that the food isn't outstanding, but it's ok enough to come back every now and again if you get a craving for Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times now. The first time was really good. Everything was hot and tasted good. The second time wasn't that great, but I blamed it on being a weeknight dinner. The third time was a Saturday dinner, and it was pretty terrible, everything tasted bland but it was mostly hot for some items. Thinking that nothing could be worse than my previous time, I figured I'd give this another shot. Mind you, this is in a span of a two month period, I enjoy my Chinese buffets. I was wrong. It was the same scenario as the last time. Saturday dinner, food needs replenished, food that was available was cold despite being under heat. I had crunchy white rice, soggy bread, barely chewable chicken, and near tasteless everything else. I'm not expecting the world from a Chinese buffet but you could at least keep the food hot. Considering this place is new, you'd think that they would at least do that."}
{"text":"This is definitely different from the last restaurant that occupued this space. The food isn't really impressive but it's ok and I would return. The prices are decent and the food was kept hot. Even if you want to stay away from the buffet, you can have them make your own healthy stir fry. For $10 a person, you can feed and army and leave feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"Great food! Overall much better than the place that was here prior the food is very fresh and tasty go to one of the best Chinese buffets in Pittsburgh for sure! But yes it is still a Chinese buffet no they are not giving out filet mignon but very good!"}
{"text":"If you are hoping for the old Tokyo sushi., you will be very very disappointed.  They have a limited choices for sushi and mostly is made from artificial crab.  Rest of the food is average Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"Great selection and delicious food for the price. Fresh and tasty sushi, delicious asian and American food. Made to order hibachi and tasty desserts. friendly service and clean restaurant"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see this place opened I couldn't wait to go.  With dreams of rows and rows of sushi in my head I went with my trusty sidekick, my sushi loving sister.  We both loved the sushi place that was here before and were heartbroken when it just closed suddenly so we might've build this place up in our heads that it would be like that and with sushi in their name surely it would be our new sushi place, right? Yeah so it was a big letdown when we get there and see a teeny little section for the sushi :-( 

With our dreams crushed, I couldn't fully enjoy how good the Chinese food, that was well represented, actually was.  I might have to give it another shot.

A super plus - they had the delicious sugar donuts here - which I highly recommend to get with a scoop of ice cream.  

So if you're looking for a good variety of hot and delicious Chinese food and a big selection of ice cream (yum!) and desserts than this is the place for you.  If you're looking for rows and rows of delicious sushi - you will be disappointed.  

We went for lunch and the price was so reasonable for the buffet - the soda is where they make their money - it was almost half of what we paid for our lunch buffet.  Staff was nice though and it was clean and nicely decorated in there with lots of seating."}
{"text":"Was running errands on McKnight Road, and decided to give this place a go. Used to be Tokyo Sushi buffet. They've changed the format a bit - not centered on Sushi, though they do have a selection of I'd say about 10 different rolls. They still have the make-your-own stir fry area, and have a great selection of Chinese items. I was here on a Thursday about noon and it was PACKED. Everything seemed to be hot and the staff worked feverishly to keep the dishes replenished and the tables neat and old dishes cleared. It's not gourmet food, but there's plenty of variety and everything tastes decent. They could do a better job of labeling dishes, but that's a small quibble. The staff was pleasant, and the price can not be beat. I don't go to a place like this for American food, but they had an assortment of that too. I personally would rather they replaced boring American food, which I'm certain other places could do much better, with some other more exotic Asian dishes, but that's just me. I'm sure over time they'll figure what works and what doesn't."}
{"text":"I went in here a little wary from the other comments. Like they said the sushi wasn't fabulous. But oh Lord the Chinese food is yummy! The beef and broccoli was perfect and that is my favorite choice, the sweet and sour chicken was crunchy and delicious. For dessert there were the usual options at most buffets: some assortment of ice cream and sweets. But the Chinese donuts were made perfectly! Definitely would go back!"}
{"text":"I went to Tokyo Sushi before, I feel that at TJ Buffet Sushi and Grill, they definitely made the interior a lot cleaner and new.
The food was so bomb, especially the calm and shrimp.
The sushi was okay but all their other stuff is really good!
Not too salty, not too sweet.
The waiters were pretty nice too."}
{"text":"This brand new sushi restaurant and buffet just opened a few days ago. My family and I stopped in for dinner tonight.  
This location is tuckedin right next to the Best Buy on McKnight Rd. The parking lot is clean and spacious.  
The decor is lovely and the restaurant is huge. The customer service was awesome very fast in drink and clean up. We were asked of we were enjoying everything, which we were
The food was simply splendid. There was a nice lady refreshing all the stations and bringing out more food constantly.  Everything was hot and fresh and tasted amazing. The sushi was the best part through. The man making it was so skilled and fast it was so fun to watch him work. The sushi rice was fresh and not gummy or dense tasting and the fish melted away like butter. In the rolls the vegetables were crunchy and delicious.  
All on all I am so impressed with this restaurant and we will definitely be returning anytime we are on McKnight Rd."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this buffet for awhile ever since it's opened under a new management and I finally got to come here for dinner with my big family on a Sunday evening and to my surprise, they weren't too busy at all. So they got our tables ready really quickly (we had 15 people + no reservation). 

All the food during my visit was so yummy and fresh. A lot of the buffets here in Pittsburgh doesn't have the cajun crawfish so when I saw that they have it here, that's another bonus point! 

Overall with the prices and the food selection here, it's not bad at all. I might come back some other time for lunch!"}
{"text":"Yelp thinks 3 stars is A-ok.  I think it's more like eh-ok. If you're coming here expecting sushi buffet of old you will be deeply disappointed.  This is ya basic Chinese / sushi/ hibachi buffet.  They have a little bit of everything. The rice is actually quite good but there is little variety and LOTS of cucumber filler.  They also have classic dishes like Mac and Cheese and potato skins.  I'm not quite sure what hard boiled eggs and olives are doing next to the pudding but the grilled squid was excellent. 

It was clean and all the food was served at the correct temperature.  Probably not going back by choice."}
{"text":"10-17-17 Edit- TJ Buffet has reworked their dinner. They've upgraded the quality and also raised the prices. So the former $10.99 Sunday dinner is now $17.99, but it now includes crab legs and other goodies. I'm adding a star for the better dinner quality. I don't know if they upgraded lunch enough to deserve more stars but the last lunch noted below was pretty bad.
--------------
9-5-17 Edit- I visited recently for lunch and was sorely disappointed. Although I've had pretty good meals for weekend dinners, lunch was pretty bad. The staff all seemed to be daydreaming and wishing they were somewhere else. Two waitresses were braiding each other's hair and the waiter was playing with his phone and the manager was reading by the cash register, but meanwhile nobody was properly running the place. There were a number of dirty plates at the buffet station and a number of empty trays that hadn't been filled for a while. Waitresses didn't come to refill water or take plates away unless you interrupt their hair-braiding and  ask them to come over. I won't go for lunch again, and I'll think twice about dinner if they're going to let their standards slip.

6-7-17 review
I was a fan of the Tokyo Sushi Buffet that was here before, and this place is NOT nearly as good for sushi. I first visited TJ Buffet just after they opened in April. Yuck, I turned around and left after seeing only a couple kinds of lousy looking sushi made with chopped mashed fish.

But TJ's has been steadily improving since then, especially for weekend dinner, so I suggest giving them a chance. They had clams and oysters on the half shell and cold shrimp, all of which were fresh. They had cold mussels too, but they were covered with a yucky slimy sweet sauce. They also had hot roast beef, hot crayfish, hot small clams in black bean sauce that was quite tasty. Chinese style ribs, chicken wings, Oh, and a couple \"genuine\" types of sushi, including tuna, salmon and octopus. Their sushi maker isn't very skilled; the sushi were misshapen and had finger dents, but the fish was pretty good.

All in all it is only about 75% as good as Tokyo Sushi Buffet was, but then again, it's only 75% of the price. I'm also glad to escape the lousy \"christian music\" soundtrack that Hokkaido buffet has been playing lately."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves typical Chinese buffet food and just a little sushi. The food tasted OK. Price was reasonable. Waitresses asked if we wanted drink refills. The table was clean."}
{"text":"The closest point of comparison for this place is probably Hokkaido, since there aren't many other Asian and seafood buffets around. This probably has fewer options overall--Hokkaido has more in terms of cooked options, sushi, and even things like dim sum. But for the price point of $12 for a dinner buffet, which comes with all the seafood options, this is a pretty good deal. You have to know what to get though--some options like the steak or the grilled fish were dry and tough, while others like the cold shrimp and oysters were fairly fresh and flavorful. The sushi options were fairly limited and not too impressive. Again, they have a lot of the usual General Tso's, broccoli beef, and all those things for Americanized Chinese cravings, and they also have a decent dessert, salad, and fruit bar. Some of the cakes were apparently made in-house, but they were not so good. I would stick with the fresh fruits and maybe ice cream for post-dinner sweets."}
{"text":"I've tried this buffet twice and both times were very disappointing. 

The food does not taste fresh, even at peak Saturday lunch hours. The seasoning and sauces are pretty bland, and the meats are chewy and stringy. Appetizers were alright, but more soggy than crispy. Even the soups--which are usually good anywhere-- are somehow not good. I have not tried the sushi or hibachi. The buffet area is large, but there is very little on it that looks remotely appetizing: I stuck to the soup/app table and Chinese table. 

Also, I was surprised to see an employee remove an old tray of beef and broccoli, and proceed to put the broccoli with the chicken and broccoli! It's one thing to mix old and new of the same dish, but the mixing of meats could be an issue for many customers.  I am really not one to immediately say that a restaurant made me ill, but my friend and I both felt unwell after eating there. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Wow. Nasty. Stay far, far away. They have like five trays of sushi and they are all terrible. The other Chinese food was very poor as well."}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews but I drove from sewickley to this TJs. I was REALLY excited and super craving some delicious Chinese buffet. My absolute favorite place to eat is the TJs at the mills so I was eager to try this one out. 
     Awful. I sat there regretting every mile I drove to get there. It has NO qualities of the TJs at the mills. Even the rice sucked. How do you screw up rice?? It was just overall bad and I can't say I enjoyed a single bite."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a Chinese buffet in the area, but was disappointed in this one. The building is nice and the place is really clean, but it's brand new so that's to be expected. I was there just after 11am so the food was fresh. Selection is typical Chinese buffet fare, nothing special. \"Sushi\" is again, typical Chinese buffet type sushi and not worth wasting valuable stomach space on. My biggest complaint is that the food is probably the most bland and absolutely tasteless that I've ever had. Seriously. It's as if they're catering to the taste buds of toddlers and senior citizens. Just very, very bland and blah. I wouldn't recommend TJ's, nor would I go back."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awful. Let me say it again - this place is absolutely awful. No need for tons of explanation marks. First of all, the selection is a joke. Cheap imitation crab in anything with 'crab' in it, pizza...pizza at a sushi buffet, the smallest selection of crappy sushi I have ever seen...ever. Giant Eagle has a better selection and that is not hyperbole. The sushi 'chef' was talking on the phone with an ear bud the entire time we were there. The rolls reflected the total lack of interest and concern. This is NOT a sushi buffet. Sushi is an after thought. Wait staff lethargic and depressed (I would be too). Back to selection, mostly cheap slop - crappy meat drowning in non-descript sauces, pizza, frozen fries, tasteless clams, shrimp in shell on ice with zero seasoning, sad looking cakes, random fruit...I could go on, but I won't. I will never come back here. Terrible selection. Depressed and disinterested staff. Way better options. Golden Corral is a wiser five-star choice. I predict this place will be done in one to two years."}
{"text":"The restaurant is attractive, comfortable, and spacious.  Everything I sampled was good.  I was surprisingly pleased with the fried zucchini and sponge cake, the latter of which was in liquid and was extremely moist.  The price is a bargain at $7.99 for lunch Mondays through Saturdays, which includes appetizers, entrees, side dishes, including many American favorites, fresh fruit and desserts.  Two items that are important to me were not available: egg foo young and mixed vegetables, thus my favorite Chinese dish, tofu, was only present in small amounts in the hot and sour soup.  I may or may not return, but I have no serious complaints.  I enjoyed my bargain meal."}
{"text":"Used to be a Tokyo Sushi buffet reorganized as TJ's. The restaurant seems to be recently renovated. It is fairly clean and spacious. The food is your stereotypical Chinese American food, but were some Chinese offerings such as steamed fish, crab and clams. 

2.5/5 rounded up."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with coworkers a couple days after the grand opening.

I was very excited to see that this place opened up, especially after the amazing sushi buffet that was in the building before had closed down.  

The only thing good that this place has going for it is that the price is cheap.  I was extremely disappointed with the food quality and variety here.  

First, I will start out with the sushi.  With having Sushi in its name, I was excited to go here and was expecting to see a nice selection to choose from.  This was the first disappointment.  They did not have a big selection of sushi at all and you were limited on your options.  I tried a few different kinds and I was not impressed at all.

They did have a lot of options to choose from on the buffet, however, which was nice.   The food lacked flavor and was very poorly made, in my opinion.

You get what you pay for.  And for $7.99 for the lunch buffet, I guess I shouldn't be too disappointed.  I really wanted to like TJ Buffet.  I hope that the quality gets better in the future.  I would much rather go get sushi or Chinese food at a different establishment, and all of my coworkers felt the same way.   I hope to give it a second chance sometime in the distant future and hope that the quality improves greatly.

TJ Buffet Sushi and Grill ranks in the bottom tier of the Chinese buffets that I have eaten at."}
{"text":"Usually, when it comes to Asian food, the options are Good, Cheap, and Buffet... Pick 2.  TJs does a good job managing all three.  While their sushi selection is often very limited, the buffet and Mongolian BBQ makes up for it.

I was a huge fan of the sushi buffet that was in this restaurant previously, and while not as high quality, for the price, TJs really delivers."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a Sunday for brunch shortly before noon. We were seated promptly & the restaurant was not yet busy. This was my first visit since this buffet opened under new ownership. I had a selection of sushi, dim sum and traditional Chinese dishes. All the food during my visit was hot & fresh. The sushi was fresh & tasty for being a buffet, they had maybe 6 or so different types of rolls. They had 4 soups, I had hot & sour, my husband had wonton. Since it was Sunday the price was $13.99, which I think is still reasonable for an all you eat buffet. Lunch is cheaper. They offered spare ribs, crab legs, oysters on the half shell, many Chinese dishes & then the usual smattering of American & kids fare like Mac & cheese, pizza, mashed potatoes, beef. They also have a salad bar. They have dip your own ice cream & assorted Chinese desserts & jellos etc. My husband & I both liked all the food we ate & would return if we were in the area and hell bent on stuffing our faces."}
{"text":"Fairly newly opened in a space that was similar.  I had a good dinner experience & will return.
There was a nice selection of \"raw bar\" items -  oysters, mussels & shrimp.  There were four soups, though I didn't try any (egg drop, won ton, hot & sour + another).  There was also a few salad vegetables available.

The buffet was extensive - too many things to list.  I definitely had some string beans and cooked salmon.  The spinach & cheese had too much cheese for my liking, which was my minor complaint.  There was a sushi table, but I'm not a sushi eater.  My main course was a plate of freshly-prepared stir-fry that included items I selected from among meats/fish, vegetables, starches & sauces.  If I hadn't eaten so much raw shrimp & oysters, I'd have double-dipped the stir-fry.

For dessert, I had fresh cantaloupe & pineapple + ice cream (from among 6 flavors).  There were some pastries, but I didn't try any.  A refillable soft drink cost under $2, and not served buffet style; the server brings that + clears the plates.

The price was low for what can be had there.  The food is by no means spectacular, but it's certainly decent enough.  For those who want a gourmet meal, this probably isn't your spot."}
{"text":"If you love your self and the person(s) you are with, I urge you not to take them here. My friends and I have made a few mistakes in our lives and this is certainly one of them. We ate there Wednesday night (it's now Friday as I am writing this) and some of the people in our party still had stomach aches until this morning. The food looked good, but it wasn't. EVERYTHING had a sweet taste to it and nothing was a few degrees above room temp, so there's no telling how long it had been there. The sushi selection looked rough, but I noticed a few brave souls trying it out. Hopefully, they didn't get sick like all of us did. Service was ok, nothing really stood out. I don't think any of us will be returning."}
