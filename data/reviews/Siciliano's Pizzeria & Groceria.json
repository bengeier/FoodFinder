{"text":"The nicest two people live and work there and they make going in there the best part of my day. During my sports season I would walk there from school sit and get a hoagie, which is absolutely AMAZING, while I watched the walking dead with the one owner they are so generous and kind and make it such a happy atmosphere the good is amazing and priced so fairly that all the kids who go to Deer lakes stop in I'm gonna miss this place when I go to college"}
{"text":"Good place to get a bite for lunch.  I'm a big fan of their bacon dressing for their salads. They even warm it up for you on a good day.  They also offer a $5 lunch, which is a half a hoagie, chips, and a can off pop.  Clutch for when you forget your lunch on a work day!"}
{"text":"I was late getting out of work.....do not live in the area...knew their would be chance they would be out of 15 meatballs...especiallyv15 min before close buy the lady and gentleman smiled...greeted me warmly and went in the back to see if they had some...then then spent the extra time to make 2 meatball subs for me when they easily could have said sorry we are closing.   You don't find that kind of service any more.   This place is a gem."}
