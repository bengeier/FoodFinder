{"text":"I like to get the strawberry julius here about twice month - it has been consistently good every time.  When they are busy the line still moves quickly."}
{"text":"If you're going for ice cream or a Julius .. you are probably ok ... but in my view .. not the place to grab a quick lunch.  Ordered BLT ... and the meat tasted old.  All food selections are pretty unhealthy.  No salad to substitute for chips... as with McDonald's, Wendy's, Arby's, or Chick Filet.   Pretty sub-par sandwich.  Nothing to get excited about ... and as long as I don't get sick .. I guess I'm ok ... just not going back.  For the money ... Chipotle is probably a better, fresher, and healthier choice (depending upon what you choose) .. in the San Tan mall ...or even Paradise Bakery."}
{"text":"We were not able to find the location and when we called the, \"manager in charge\" told us she didn't know where she was located at hung up the phone. Several call backs later we were told they were they were located near different stores where they were not at.  Finally, we asked asked for a General Manager, only to be told he is out of town. There is no-one else to speak to besides the 16 year old acting manager who doesn't know where she is located at. Would not recommend this location if you want good customer service!!"}
{"text":"It has been a LONG TIME since I've enjoyed a DQ treat! I ordered a Heath bar Blizzard in size small. It was delicious! Took me back 13 years when I use to frequent a nearby DQ in Texas.  Customer service at this corner suite at the mall was nice. It wasn't busy and the 2 workers were attentive and patient with the 4 of us (me, my 2 girls, and one of their friends).  The place was clean and the worker was helpful in directing us to the nearest bathroom (about 20 steps away).  Only surprise: the size small was too much! All of us struggled to finish passed half way. We should have ordered the mini. Now we know why it's on the menu.   I paid $3.80 each. Sounds pricey until you start eating it. We definitely feel like we got our money's worth. Plus, the size small, when they fill it, towers over the top about 1-2 inches!  I can't promise I'll frequent this place (I mean, I DO have a waistline to consider), but I definitely recommend it.  One more piece of advice, eat it outside. We about froze our tails off until we got smart and sat outside. DQ Blizzard + 103 degrees = \"It's nice outside. Let's hang out!\""}
{"text":"Manager is the kindest man! Very friendly and helpful staff! Highly recommend this location!!"}
{"text":"Love the deal for ice cream cones and that is what I have tried so far. I will come back to try food items."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly greeted us coming in  I had the strawberry cheesecake blizzard and my cousin had the oreo blizzard i will definitely return to this location"}
{"text":"their custom cake dept is great! dont understand why they dont have chocolate sprinkles available?!"}
{"text":"My husband and I got one cookie dough blizzard and one role blizzard. Previously we had a couple nice blizzards here but this second time was awful. There were hardly any topping (not as bad as the worst blizzard ever at the other Gilbert Rd. but 2nd worst)... The drive through line was looooong and sloooow. And ultimately not worth the wait. So far one hit and one miss. Unfortunatley for us that (including Gilbert Rd) DQ as a whole is more miss than hit and no more DQ for us..."}
{"text":"When I saw the girl wipe her nose with the back of her hand in the middle of making blizzards, I should have left immediately.  Of course I stayed and ordered a sundae and two pretzel sticks. My sundae had hair in it. The same girl that was making blizzards also made my sundae. I told the kid I ordered it from about the hair in my sundae. He seemed annoyed that I was upset about it. He replaced it with another sundae. He never asked me if I wanted him to replace my sundae, but assumed I did. I then told him that I didn't want a replacement, I wanted a refund! Again, he assumed I wanted a refund for my sundae.  Do you think I want to eat food from a place that serves its food with hair in it?! Long story short, it took a really long time to get a refund for my entire order because they can't reverse a debit and don't have any change to make refunds. If you want delicious desserts without hair and friendly employees to help you, go to Frost! Stay away from this pathetic place."}
{"text":"5pm on a Monday, 2 young girls working with zero smiling, zero eye contact, not kind at all. Very slow moving, acting like they hate life! Ordered a large pina colada regular and it has zero flavor. So the whole trip was a waste."}
{"text":"Seriously got rid of the chocolate ice cream because it wasn't selling!?? What a joke! Everyone knows the chocolate and the vanilla/chocolate twist are staples at DQ. Someone clearly cannot order product correctly if you're losing money over chocolate ice cream."}
{"text":"Brand spanking new in April and spotlessly clean.  Perky and helpful employees and they even have coconut to make my favorite blizzard (Hawaiin!).  Good drive thru access and a couple outdoor tables.  Let's hope they keep the dedication fresh."}
{"text":"Never fill the cups all the way up and unless you ask for extra toppings you get hardly any. Don't waste your time! Drive the extra distance to a different DQ!!"}
