{"text":"Best in Pittsburgh hands down. Pumpernickel raisin rolls are my favorite, the ciabatta is awesome...salt sticks too. They have just about anything you could think of and it's always bakes fresh that morning."}
{"text":"Vietnamese people LOVE french baguettes. It has something to do with French occupation resulting in my older relatives knowing how to speak French and eating my curry with bread. (Grammar-wise, why are all my relatives eating my curry? I refuse to fix the previous sentence.)

I went on a journey through Pittsburgh in search of a good baguette. Of course, being a student, my first destinations were Giant Eagle, Whole Foods, and Trader Joes. After I finished sobbing with swollen gums, curled up at the bottom of my bathtub, I was determined to not give up. Then I found the outdoor bread stand at Strip District, Allegro, and BreadWorks Bakery. All three make fantastic bread and specialize in their own things, but the award for best baguette goes to BreadWorks Bakery. For now... DUN DUN DUN.

So of course, with every bakery, there is the option of buying and eating right away. But there is also the option for half-baked baguettes at BreadWorks, where the bread is not fully finished and you finish the rest of the baking yourself. Now, if you hear yourself saying, \"Why would I do the rest of the job for them?\" I don't want to be your friend. Who would not want freshly baked bread at home? Ugh, who are you? Anyways, I buy a bag of those, put it in my freezer, then finish it off in the oven whenever I need my baguette fix. (Seriously, I love this bread. My girlfriend is worried about my waistline).

So what makes a good baguette? It has to be crunchy and thin on the outside, but delicate, light, and soft on the inside. You don't fight the bread when you eat it (and it shouldn't win, for that matter... your poor gums after sub-par bread); instead, it should break and tear easily. The bread here has those qualities.

The rest of the breads are good. There are tons of varieties. The mini rolls are adorable. And I LOVE BREAD.

Besides the delicious bread, this stuff is also cheap, so huge bonus of awesomeness right there."}
{"text":"The bread here is some of the best I've ever had, and that is coming from a bread aficionado.  The prices seem fair as well, although I quite dislike that they take cash only."}
{"text":"What can I say? If you like bread, you HAVE to visit their store. And once you do, it'll become a regular thing! The bread is baked to perfection and is simply delicious!  Particular favorites are:

* Specialty Focacia's (different every day)
* Asiago Mini Crocodile (perfect amount of cheesiness)
* Rustic Walnut  Raisin (great toasted for breakfast)
* Raisin Grain and Pumpernickel Raisin Rolls (I can't stop eating them)
* Sour #2 (Get it sliced or slice it yourself for FANTASTIC sandwiches)

The store is open until 6pm during the week and starts marking down what's left on the shelves at 5:30pm. But go earlier or even order ahead for the best selection! They also have weekend hours, but I've not been to the store on the weekend myself.

Oh, and what they don't sell before closing? They donate to local food banks so even the poor can sometimes have a taste of ambrosia!

WARNING: The retail store only takes cash, so plan ahead!"}
{"text":"If anybody remember barsottis bakery that used to make great salt stick ,well bread works has the recipe try them they r great"}
{"text":"Best bread, rolls, buns, salt sticks and focaccia crusts in Pittsburgh.  The counter ladies are always super nice and helpful and I love going to this place.  Their brioche buns are fantastic, but get there early cause they ALWAYS sell out.  CASH ONLY..."}
{"text":"Going to the store is highly addictive. And bring a kid with you, they will give them bread! Great place."}
{"text":"Great local business. Great local bread. Great low prices. I go there as often as I can and I'm never disappointed. It's worth having to wait in line when they first open each morning."}
{"text":"Fabulous bread! I've been coming here for the longest time, I'm never disappointed. They are consistently good. 

To my surprise ony most recent trip, I see that they now take credit cards with a minimum $10 order.

I've tried everything in the store,  and I suggest you do, too. Everything is made from high quality ingredients and traditional practices. 

If you shop a half hour before closing,  there's a 50% discount. Make sure you take a number at the door, the line gets long at closing."}
{"text":"I can't believe these guys have been around since 1979, and I only heard of them recently because a caterer I hired used Breadworks. This is some of the best bread in town! And, such a variety, too! I make a detour on my way home about once a week to get something special (and it's all special).

Their knot rolls are particularly fabulous. I highly recommend them if you're having friends for dinner. They'll worship you after eating these little gems.

I am also very partial to their rye, pumpernickel, and marble rye. All fantastic! I can't wait to try everything they make.

And, it's not expensive at all. It costs less than the factory-produced bread you get at the grocery store."}
{"text":"No frills, no fake smiling employees, just REALLY GREAT BREAD. Fresh, authentic, all natural ingredients and very good prices. I regularly buy 2 baguettes here for a $1.25 or $1.50. Lots of rolls, breadsticks, rye, wheat and focaccia. It's a small store at the bakery, prices are a lot lower than at Wholey's or somewhere else in the city. Many restaurants use breadworks. Great stuff."}
{"text":"The BreadWorks bakery is the best! It's not a \"bakery\" of the type that makes cupcakes, this is bread-only. It's serious bread, with artisan loaves of sourdough, rye, pumpernickel, French and so forth. They'll slice the softer ones like pumpernickel on request but not a hard-crusted bread such as sourdough. I've had great breads in San Francisco, NYC, Paris, Montreal and other major urban centers, this is the only place in Pittsburgh that is up to those standards. It's very similar quality-wise to Iggy's in Cambridge MA if you're familiar with that."}
{"text":"Why have I not been getting bread from BreadWorks my entire life?  I have never actually been inside BreadWorks, but tons of Pittsburgh restaurants use their bread.  So finally, my parents stopped in with a 50% off coupon last weekend to try some different things.  And since I am poor thanks to graduate school, they shared.

First, we tried an assortment of rolls. If you are a fan on Max's Allegheny Tavern, this is where they order their rolls from!  My personal favorite was the pumpernickel raisin roll.  

However, the real winner of this trip was the pepperoni and cheese focaccia style bread they picked up. It was served in a pizza box, and probably about 8 to 10 inches in diameter. This bread was amazing. It was packed with pepperoni and amazing cheese.  Then, there was baked cheese all over the top layer of the bread.  It was one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. I savored every last bite.

My parents walked out with all of this for under $4 so it would normally be around $8.  What a steal!  I just wish BreadWorks was a bit more convenient to my house, but it is so good that I am willing to travel!"}
{"text":"STOP right now ...if you live in Pittsburgh and you love good bread
do not buy packaged supermarket bread until you go to breadworks ...because you might never buy packaged stuff again
ok so here is the lowdown 
they sell bread and only bread no pies cakes cupcakes etc
they sell bread 
rolls of all sorts yeah how about 2.40 for eight rolls?
baguettes yeah how about 1.40 a loaf? and its SO GOOD 
loafs of sourdough, asiago & ryes 
foccacia 
and more bread
right before Thanksgiving you could order up pumpkin bread oh it was so good
and its all so good and fresh 
easy parking they have their own lot
everyone there is very friendly and will gladly wait while you peruse their wares 
the other day I was making my family sloppy Joe and I realized I had no rolls ...a quick drive to the breadworks for nice fresh slider rolls and I was good to go
ahh its a long story but a few months ago Chris the real estate guy from Brighton Heights(he knows everything about this area)  told me you MUST go to Breadworks and get their salt sticks and yes he is right they are so good too
this is why I moved to Pittsburgh(so much good food) and I only live about 10 min away 
but really the Breadworks is worth a drive from almost anywhere.
I always knew they were a cash only but recently I saw a sign says 10 dollar minimum on a card
because of their awesome prices if you leave with 10 dollars worth of their bread you will have a months worth."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Breadworks. It's about a mile from my front door, so I visit there about once a week to stock up. Since discovering this place I haven't bought bread at any other store or bakery. First, it smells AMAZING when you walk in the very tiny storefront. Depending on the day of the week and time of day, this place gets crowded! The best time to go is right when they open at 6:30 am, it's the only way to assure that they haven't run out of your favorites. This happens often, especially with the whole wheat, which is downright incredible. They have everything from smaller hard rolls, sourdough and salt sticks, baguettes, larger loaves of pretty much every kind of bread you can think of. They even have featured breads daily, such as raisin walnut and cheddar focaccia. And the best part is, it's CHEAP!! Crazy cheap! Only negative is the employees are not thrilled to be there as a whole, most seem almost annoyed most of the time, especially if you don't know what you want immediately upon walking in the door. It's a small price to pay to get in on the Breadworks action!"}
{"text":"Great bread and excellent customer service!

We went in wanting bread to take back home with us, but we didn't know what kind to get. We decided to get a couple of rolls and one of the ladies let us have three full size rolls just as samples. I ate the raisin rye right away and it was excellent, I'm sure it would be even better toasted.

I'd definitely buy my bread here if we lived in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Will keep it short and sweet.  I refuse to bring any other bread into my house except Breadworks.  It is 100% worth the trip to the bakery or one of their distributors (shout out to Penn Mac for carrying it).  Getting a min-ciabatta or mini-french baguette with some jamon and manchego cheese takes me right back to Spain while still being here in Pittsburgh.

Also my go to for rolls for holidays like Christmas and Easter.  So simple to just pick them up fresh, toss them in the oven for a few minutes to warm them up before the holiday meal, and they are good to go. Honestly not worth the time making from scratch yourself given the quality Breadworks puts out there and they simply slaughter anything you will find in a Giant Eagle, Walmart, Aldis, or other grocery store bakery.

A hidden secret that they make but you will only see if you go to the bakery is their potato rolls.  They are a must try! 

Truly fresh-made bread without preservatives and are truly supporting a Pittsburgh born and bred business."}
{"text":"Incredible bread here!  They don't use preservatives so you better make sure you eat it up fast or have room in the freezer. They have a large selection of breads. The daily rotation of Focaccia is something worth checking out. I think Monday is pepperoni focaccia day"}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed Breadworks yet?!  Shame on me. 

I love coming here for fresh bread--the only down side is that I feed two people, and most of the loaves that they sell are for at least four people, so I end up eating at least two servings of bread with dinner.  Can't fault them for that, though...

They have french loaves, breadsticks, specialty focaccias...and I am just addicted to their  salt sticks.  SO GOOD!

They are cash only, but you don't need much, because I have never spent more than $5 here.  (Yes, you read that correctly.  The bread is AMAZING and at least half off from what you'd pay in the strip for the same loaf.) 

If you're anywhere close, make sure you try it!"}
{"text":"Amazing bread. We make trips to BreadWorks part of our weekly rituals. Seven-grain is a fav. Good Tuscan, raisin, focaccia. And the baguettes are the best in town. Some of us are addicted to the salt sticks. There's a discount for seniors and half-priced everything at 5:30. We adore this establishment!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't have a lot of space to stand in & is cash only. Other than that, I really enjoy it. The prices are beyond reasonable for fresh baked bread. The woman running the front counter gave me 2 samples of bread with my purchase which I thought was very nice. I will definitely be back to try their foccaccia because it looked very delicious."}
{"text":"Bread works is really good and you can get really good rooks you should go there it is in Pittsburgh PA"}
{"text":"If you want the best bread around then go too Breadworks it is definitely worth the trip.
My wife has brought home stuff from them many times, But I have recently gone 2 times myself.
The Italian bread is amazing as well as the salt sticks and onion sticks both which are totally amazing.
The prices are amazingly low and a really great bargain.
The staff are really nice and super friendly.
I cant wait to go again, Now that I am writing the review I am getting hungry I think i am going to head over soon.
They have plenty of parking and again prices are great.
The only recommendation is get there early as they are so popular they run out of stuff early.
I highly recommend Breadworks and like I said I definitely will be going over and over again"}
{"text":"We didn't order directly from them, so I'm not ranking any lower than three stars.

HOWEVER, our wedding catering sourced their bread from Breadworks and it was quite unimpressive.  In fact, many of our guests identified it as the one thing they would have changed about our meal...

Not sure if it was because our reception was on a Saturday and maybe the hotel only takes deliveries on weekdays or something, but it just wasn't fresh-tasting and certainly wasn't on-par with say, Mancini's."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love good, well baked bread? Bread Works is very good bread in dozens of varieties. I'm partial to their old fashioned salt sticks with caraway seeds, a long time Pittsburgh tradition. Great dinner rolls, loaves, sausage rolls, and lots of other items. This place also delivers to local restaurants, so you've probably had their products and not known."}
{"text":"I'm still a fan but something is starting to change here and not for the better. The last two times I've bought from here I've been a little disappointed. I got some hoagy rolls that were dense and tasted flat, I've had better from Sam's club. Today I stopped and asked for some Rustic Italian and what I got was a regular Italian loaf and it was only so-so. It was only slightly better than any other place that bakes it's own Italian like Shop n save. Maybe the store clerk gave me the wrong bread and I hope so because I have loved this place for years and I hope they aren't just making for the restaurant trade now."}
{"text":"I can't believe that in all the years that I've lived in Brighton Heights that I've never been to the Breadworks! I remember my grandmother going there every week when was a child. They have such a fantastic selection of freshly baked breads at reasonable prices. You will more than likely leave with more bread than you planned! We got the marble rye which was buy one get one free (BONUS!), and a loaf of Italian bread as well.  The bread is delicious and very fresh.  We devoured almost an entire loaf of the marble rye in less than 2 days!  

This place has the best bread that I've tasted in a long time and we will definitely go back.  I can't wait to try their focaccia next!  It's worth the visit whether you live nearby or across town.  Highly recommend!"}
