{"text":"Decided to have lunch here a few times because it is fairly convenient for us. Dark for my taste but makes watching golf nicer. All 3 times we ate here the service was decent however if you are served by the owner himself it is much faster and more attentive to your needs. Burgers are delicious, fries were chunky and fresh and I especially like Cevapi (Bosnian Specialty). I will go back :)"}
{"text":"I love what the new owners have done to the place. It looks like a whole new place. The service was great and the food was yummy! Everyone that I went with (me +5 others) all ordered food and everyone really enjoyed what they ordered. Good times had by all."}
{"text":"Worst experience at a pub.  I ordered a steak sandwich and a drink. 20 min later - no food. I order another drink and 15 minutes later I'm promised the food is coming up soon.  15 minutes later I'm promised five minutes. Foolishly I order a third drink and when it's nearly finished I'm told the food is being \"plated\". It's almost an hour since I arrived and I tell the waitress to bring the bill.   She insists that food will only a few minutes.  I'm in no mood for food anymore and say I'm leaving.   I'm left having another 5 minutes and a sorry looking meal is delivered. I tell the waitress in leaving and once again request the bill.   The waitress starts negotiating a free drink but tell her too late I'm leaving.  I paid for the drinks AND the meal I didn't eat and left. * steal sand on special $12 and three Strongbow total bill $$42.00.   The bill was wrong but I was going to.      ape s%!t  so I just aid and left.   I will NEVER return and I'm telling everyone about my crappy experience.  I walked over to another nearby pub.   I don't understand why the service was so ridiculously slow.  ** I WILL NEVER RETURN **"}
{"text":"So I've been here a few times and every time I go it seems like of you're not a regular you don't get service as quick!! Somewhat annoying as we are all paying customers and should be granted the same service! As for the food, it's okay."}
{"text":"Was here traveling for one night for work, found this  very clean neighborhood sports bar. Incredible food specials .22 cent wings and $1 pierogies! Your dollar will go a long way here."}
{"text":"I like this place good music good atmosphere... Best bar in the area... Great service!! I'll come back!!"}
{"text":"I hear a lot of people saying it wasn't that nice in there before the renovations.  I never saw it then, but I can tell you that I like it now.  Looks like a Sports Lounge should look.  Other than the fact that the owner introduced himself to me and it has a warm vibe...  the food was beyond my expectation.

Specifically, they have a meal called something like \"Captains Healthy\"... something.  It is lean chicken breast, cooked broccoli, and sweet potatoes.  Since I am heavily in to fitness, I found this meal option to be PERFECT!  (I just add an extra chicken breast)

I now have a place where I can go with my friends for the game and while they drink and eat their wings... I can stay in check with my healthy diet :)

LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"I finally returned for some food and beverages with friends.  Service was just as good, but the server was new and she was a real keener.  I had the chicken quesadilla, which was very hot, hefty and full of delicious, oozing cheese.  My spouse had the lasagna which looked really good but he noted there wasn't enough cheese.  I think the prices are reasonable.  

The Calgary Flames game was on and unfortunately the volume was cranked, so we had to yell at each other across the table.  Apparently the overall volume was fine before the game started.  Karaoke was set up and ready to go, which is part of the Friday night agenda.  Once the DJ'd music started, it was also very loud.  Not that I'm old, but screaming at your friends just from being in a pub atmosphere is a bit of a turn off for me.  I haven't been to Captain's enough to know if this is normal for a weekend, so I'll give it another shot later and likely make a point of checking out the karaoke.  It might be a fun time and the place was busy."}
{"text":"First time here since the Reno.  Like the new garage doors on the West side. On a sunny summer day it's nice almost like a patio.  

Food is great.  Lots of pub stuff and healthy veggie treats.  Good pizza and open Sunday nights."}
{"text":"I only ever went here for the 9cent wings, and even at that they're tiny wings with little to no sauce on them.. but I guess you get what you pay for lol . the waitresses are rude and I don't think they were ever properly trained, espcially the one that shows her lower back tattoo. and to top it off, My drink had someones lipstick mark on it from someone else using it before me or something.. 

If I could I'd put zero out of five."}
{"text":"great service! great specials! juke box is always on point! friendly neighborhood dive bar. love it here."}
