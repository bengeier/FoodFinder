{"text":"Hidden gem. Located in the food court of the Lawrence Square shopping centre (a discount mall just south of yorkdale). This non-franchise eatery serves Greek/Mediterranean food at a value second to none. The chicken and pork souvlaki are very tasty. 2 types of potatoes - lemon and roasted garlic with paprika - both fantastic. The owner's homemade salad dressing is very nice as well. His homemade burger is made with a special recipe and also tastes great. Most of the menu items are homemade except for the gyros and the fish filet. 
Jack and his wife are very welcoming and they are proud of their work. Service from all the staff is excellent. Good healthy food for a great price."}
{"text":"Best option for food in the Lawrence Square food court, by far!  Generous portions, reasonable prices and always very tasty.  The owner has been running this place for over 15 years and has very loyal clientele in the area.  I work nearby and stop by frequently and will continue to do so."}

Give it a try when you are in Lawrence Square. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly tasty for a food court take away. I had a chicken souvlaki dinner and it was around $6.50. It had chicken, rice, two types of potatoes, salad, tzatziki, and pita. The salad was fine, lots of tomatoes and I don't like tomatoes so I ate around them, sadly they stole all the feta in their nasty tomato trenches. The rice wasn't any different than what you'd get at \"real\" Greek restaurants. The yellow potatoes were really flavorful. The roasted potato was disgusting. It had vile flavours I couldn't identify and although it was well browned and wrinkly as if it were cooked the inside was raw. It was probably the worst thing I've ever eaten in my life but luckily it was a very small part of the meal. The chicken was delicious but dried out. It had been sitting around way too long. I wish they'd left it on the skewers, it's more fun to eat it that way, but it was skewer-less and thrown on top of the rice. The pita was fresh and the tzatziki was perfectly garlicky. 

I'd go back for a cheap, quick lunch but don't think it's like what you'd get on the Danforth."}
