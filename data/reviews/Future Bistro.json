{"text":"Anyone remember when Future Bakery was big business? It had multiple locations around Toronto, and it was focused heavily on the food and culture of its Ukrainian ownership. While the Annex location is still kicking strong and remains a popular beacon for starving U of T students, the others, except for the tiny St. Lawrence Market outlet and a baking factory in the city's Westend, have all but disappeared. All that remains is a lone, ceramic Ukrainian Easter egg sitting high up on a shelf in the Annex location. But time moves on I suppose, and there's a reason that despite the others all going under, the Annex location is still packed at almost all hours of the day.

Future is cheap. Straight up, that's probably one of the predominant reasons they're so busy, but it's not as if you're getting some reheated crappy food for your money. They make some pretty good stuff. (Right off the bat, I'd like to point out that there is a food outlet right in the back of this place, and I think they sublease it to sell food in there, but I am including it in this review, despite that they might be two different places.) Most notably, you can grab a pretty good breakfast there, especially on a Sunday morning. Sundays in the Annex are deadsville; everything is closed until the early-afternoon, so if you live in the area or you happen to find yourself there because you thought everything would be open, this is a great place to grab a pleasant morning breakfast or a greasy hangover cure.

Future has some seriously amazing cakes, and if that's your thing, then you should know that Future is probably one of the best values for cake in the city. Besides having a killer selection of top quality cakes, they all sell for about 5 bucks a cut. There are a whole ton of different kinds too, ranging from fruit pies and caramel-based cakes to cheesecakes and heavy-chocolate tortes. Although I don't find their coffee particularly spectacular, they do have it available, and it's still a pretty natural choice to go with the cake, despite being nothing-more-than-average.

Once the warmer months hit, Future place has got a pretty spectacular patio too.  Busy, big, and perfect for people watching, it's easily the 2nd best patio spot in the Annex. It covers the whole side of Future's corner building, and it's an ideal place for cold pints.

Future pretty much accommodates everyone. Early morning breakfast, late night after the bar, mid-week meeting spot, in-between-classes study hole; no matter what you're using it for, chances are that Future will be able to offer you something. So despite the fact that the Ukrainian aspect is no longer really existing here--or at least not being a visible existence--it hasn't slowed this place down at all. Most likely, people haven't even noticed the lack of Ukrainianess. And while purely for nostalgic reasons, I find that a bit on the disappointing side, as long as every time I go in there I can be reminded of Future's past by that lone Uki Easter egg, I'll make due, and I'll being eating cake."}
{"text":"First time going because my friend said it was cute. Loved the service and their cake selection is huge!!!!"}
{"text":"Future's has delicious cakes! I love the cheesecakes the most. Although a little on the expensive side, it's totally worth it.  Make sure you get the punch card to earn your way up to a free slice. If you're looking for something to just satisfy a craving they have little tiny pieces left over they sell at a discounted price. The other baked goods are quite expensive so I never get one of those. 

Ive never dined in or ordered anything off the menu but lots of my friends have recommended it to me. This place is always busy and probably one of the most popular places in the Annex."}
{"text":"I admit it. I am addicted to the Dutch Apple Crumble Pie. There, I've said it. 

Going for a big slab of cake at Future Bakery on a Sunday afternoon (actually, it doesn't really matter what day it is) has to be one of my favourite Toronto experiences. Although I've always just had warm crumble with cream, I can speak on behalf of my friends (who are a little bit more experimental than I) to confirm that all the other cakes are pretty amazing too. 

The studenty atmosphere makes it all very laid-back and means you can happily take your time, without feeling like you have to rush. 

I have to say, I have tried eating their regular dinner/lunch food and it's not good. Although if you're after big portions at cheap prices then you could do worse."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Future's for over three years now, ever since I came to Toronto. Whenever I need my cake fix, this is my go-to. Great cakes, good beer, and a good atmosphere. But really great cakes."}
{"text":"I always return to this place after my friend took me here 6 years ago for sandwich and cheesecake. Their slices of cakes are so big we had to share our blueberry cheesecake. A very fine collection of cakes. I used to brag about this to my friends all the time. I always had a tough time picking which one I wanted the most. It's sort of like being at Cheesecake Factory, but the cakes were better.

This time when I went back, I was surprised that they had smaller, leftover slices for $2 each. Just perfect for me. The bad news was that their chocolate mousse cake was nothing compared to any of their cheesecakes. 

Also, when I ventured downstairs to their restroom, I was quite terrified. Do NOT use their restaurant."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5
Service: 3/5
Cleanliness: 3.5/5
Price: $$

I have a confession to make. I love cake. During my undergrad days, I ate a slice of cake a day. It was my food that allowed me to destress and its delicious taste in my mouth was so addicting. I can proudly admit that I was a regular at Future Bistro over the 5 years I was in Toronto because I was one of those who got their card stamped for every slice of cake that was ordered.

My ultimate favourite cake is the Red velvet, but here at Future Bistro, I tend to gravitate towards cakes that I had never tried before. It's better if you go with a few friends or as a group, then you can try many different cakes at once. :P The service at the bistro seems like it can be a little improved; it does get quite busy during peak hours and many things are self serve (cutlery for example).

The bistro offers over a dozen different kinds of cakes for you to choose from, not including its pies and other baked goods. I haven't heard one complain about how bad a cake tasted here so I think it's quite safe to go out of your comfort zone and try one that you had never tried before. I tend to gravitate towards cakes that have caramel in them while I'm here.

The Super Caramel Crunch is my ultimate favourite at Future Bistro. It is layers of caramel and whipped cream which I absolutely love. Some might think it's a tad bit too sweet, but I beg to differ. It's the perfect amount of sweetness for me and I can (sometimes) finish this thing before you get to take a bite. It's quite light and fluffy compared to other denser cakes, so if you're a bit too full from that dinner you just had or want something less filling, this might be a good choice.

If you go to U of T, chances are you have probably walked past this bistro many times. The bistro opens their windows for the summer and has a great patio outside for you to enjoy. Not only do they serve great desserts, the bistro has great tapas and drinks to share with your friends as well! It really is a great place to end your night whether you get something sweet or savoury (or both). I would highly recommend you to visit if you love cake like me or want to end your night at a nice bistro with lots of locals!"}
{"text":"I wanted to find a good place to do some work on a sunny Sunday afternoon and I hadn't intended on coming here because there was no free wifi. But, there was space and the menu was student-budget friendly.

I only ordered a regular cup of coffee and a cheese scone. The scone was big but not particularly cheesy. The coffee wasn't particularly aromatic but you get refills for $1. They also have a special discount for students.

But if you're not the kind of person who can work in noisy places, I suggest you go somewhere else. 

I'd recommend this place if you want a place for brunch. It was 4:00PM  in the afternoon and the place was packed with people still ordering eggs and toast. 

Cheap and lively, I see this place as being dependable but it's not the best cafe for studying.

Apparently their cakes are to die for but, as a miserly student, I didn't have the stomach to dish out $6 for cake."}
{"text":"Crepes: good but the toppings are a bit too sweet for my taste but the texture of the actual crepe is good. 

Cheesecake: always so tasty and always want another but my food morals keep me in check. I mostly order the strawberry cheesecake but have taken to ordering the cheesecake only in the winter because the cakes are too soft/warm in the summer because of lack of refrigeration"}
{"text":"Great patio and service but quality of food is not good. Hollandaise is not tasty and cold. Peameal is undercooked and muffins untoasted. Cmaaaaan"}
{"text":"First and last time here I'm afraid. Poached eggs were cold! We sent them back and they were replaced with warm ones but of course the rest of the food was allowed to get cold in the meantime."}
{"text":"Come here for cake, the end. Yesterday I inserted a giant slice of strawberry shortcake into my face and it was glorious. Many of the reviews here talk about coming for breakfast or other meals, and I just keep thinking \"No. No. WHAT ARE YOU DOING\". Don't come here for anything other than DELICIOUS CAKE."}
{"text":"The cheesecakes come pre-made from LA Rocca and 2 other places that can be bought at metro for much cheaper. Ther are roaches and rats commonly found in the basement. They hire illegal workers from other countries with no work permit. The pay them 9$/ hr cash.. this business seems like a great place but it supports illegal employment. Which takes away from somebody who is legally able to work so they can save 2$/hr and slave drive them when they don't know their rights. They also commit fruad by making certain employees fill out program papers where they get government assistance...Boycott future bistro...."}
{"text":"Lured in by the promise of All You Can Eat Perogies and cheap, fast eats before a show, we ventured into Future. It was not so great. The perogies and gravy were bland and the salad was limp with over-acidic dressing. We'll be sticking to their cakes and delicious rye breads (from the outlet) from now on."}
{"text":"As a descendent of Ukrainians, the Future Bakery franchise always got under my skin. The food is mediocre (I once had the Future Bakery holopchi, aka cabbage rolls, and they tasted like wet newspaper--never again!), and I wouldn't recommend it as a good introduction to eastern European cuisine.

Their bread (it's supposed to be a bakery, right?) is pretty good. They sell it in other bakeries and specialty food shops, but it's better to get it at the source--the bagged stuff you find around town is a bit bland.

What bugs me about Future is how it's popular with people who have no clue about its ethnic roots, which is why, I suspect, the Future in heavily-Ukrainian Bloor West Village closed down a few years ago. This Future Bakery location is a little better than that one was, but it too always struck me as being a little soulless. It has a greater infusion of downtown/Annex hipsters, which is good in a way, but begs the question: with no distinctive personality, why bother?"}
{"text":"The best chai latte and most amazing cakes in town!  The breakfast is decent, and most of all cheap.  It's a strong student culture place.  Not our favourite by far, but great for the price!"}
{"text":"When I was in high school, before Starbuck's, I went to Future Bakery to meet friends. I mean, that's what you do in high school right? Have coffee and smoke.

Back then you could smoke inside. And Future Bakery was the spot. Large enough that there was always a place to sit, local enough that they'd remember your order if you came more that twice, and a large enough selection that there was something for everyone. Cheese cake, that's my thing and they have plenty here. In the summer, they have a nice side street patio, and it still has that worn in feel of a student joint. Best of all, you can work there for hours, play dominos or study and no one will bother you."}
{"text":"So I have to say this review is based on our experience yesterday. (we have had better ones before)

We were rather disappointed in our late night snack Friday night. We got everything to go, or else I think I would have complained directly to the staff. 

Our Order:
2 slices - cherry cheesecake, and pecan pie
2 drinks - coffee, and hot spiced apple cider

The cherry cheesecake was pretty good. It had a solid rich cheesecake flavour. The 2 stars are for scored solely for it's deliciousness.

However, my hot apple cider was so heavily spiced, I had to throw it out after 2 sips. I normally do like a lot of spice in my food, so for me to say that it's too much, means it was undrinkable!

Their pecan pie somehow ended up with the filling underneath the crust, so it was pecans on top, crust underneath, and a peculiar mince-meat/lumpy textured filling on the bottom. Totally unappetizing. Is this normal, or just a really bad batch? Does anyone know?

Other than the cheesecake, I'm not sure it's even worth the calories to eat it... the nearly $20 price tag is my only motivation to try to eat it.

I might be back, we normally like the atmosphere.. but it will be for something else entirely. I don't think I could stomach trying the same items again."}
{"text":"We love hanging out at this place.  They have a kitchen with cheap but decent food.  They also have a cafe section with a huge selections of cakes and pies.  A strange but fun environment."}
{"text":"The customer service we experienced last night was distractingly poor. The organization of the restaurant (i.e. where to order, why there are two separate counters?) was not very intuitive for the first time customer. Their vegetarian entre options were lackluster. I actually did not enjoy the cabbage roll dinner that I ordered. This place does have a nice ambiance (candle on each table, big windows overlooking the hustle and bustle on Bloor) however this was quickly dampened by the awful customer service. Doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"One of my favourite late-night hangouts in TO.

Cheap beers, lots of comfort food options, and a selection of cakes to die for (one word - caramel crunch).

You'll find me on the awesome patio all summer. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I was with here with a friend & bumped into another friend on the same visit. We shared a Turtle Cheesecake & the friend we met later had a basket of onion rings bigger than my head. As enticingly crispy as they looked, I did not feel like any more food as I had just indulged in a Beef Empanada at Jumbo Empanadas prior to hitting this place up for coffee, desserts & more chatter. 

Impressive array of cakes & cheesecakes... & flavour-infused gourmet coffees. English Toffee was pretty good. Everyone gets French Vanilla & I already know how universally appealing & good it is, so I passed. 

The place was overrun by Asian Visa students because there was a promotion for 20% off all-day breakfasts with student I.D. It's very close to U of T & is a quaint, spacious atmosphere to relax & study in so I guess the congestion was inevitable. 

Very efficiently operated: I noticed that the entrees counter was separated from the desserts & beverages one. If I actually had to eat a full meal here from start to finish, I would likely have to endure both line ups. That would not be fun. I especially liked its proximity to Spadina Station. The exterior Ultramarine or royal blue walls with medium yellow trim/accents make this place easy to track/describe to a friend. I could totally see myself meeting up with people here often in the future."}
{"text":"CAKE! That's all I know about Future Bakery. I met some friends here for coffee and dessert and was blown away by the massive slices. The best part was watching people's eyes light up when their dates came back to the table with the massive pieces. Not that into cake? Well, you're in luck - they also have fruit pies and  double chocolate fudge shortbread cookies. 

FYI, I've never eaten off the menu before, but the other half of the restaurant serves brunch/lunch/dinner and has a fully licensed bar. We sat beside a couple drinking beers and eating a plate full of roasted chicken and mashed potatoes. It seems like a good, casual spot for home cookin'-like food."}
{"text":"QUALITY HAS DROPPED

I've been eating here since the 90s, the quality has dropped since the last 2 years. The cheesecake was frozen and not creamy and decadent like it used to be. The portions have gotten smaller.  They've started doing too many things and instead of doing a few things and doing them well . 

You can eat under $10 here which is pretty good, but doesn't mean the quality has to bad.  

The cheesecake I ate was overpriced for the quality, frozen, thin crust and too small a portion.  It was  supermarket quality."}
{"text":"Future Bakery is one of my favourite places to go in the Annex. It has a great vibe to it - casual, lively with lots of natural light and friendly faces. I love the concept of coffee shop/diner/pub. 

The cakes are delicious with giant sized slices. The food on the bar side is decent but nothing special.

Best things about this place: Orea cake, multiple varities of cheesecake, awesome patio for people watching and beer."}
{"text":"A place like future's is fantastic because it's honest. It is what it is, you get what you pay for. Six dollars for breakfast and it comes with unlimited coffee? You have me. No, you OWN me. 

If there is one thing I know, it's breakfast. They have a hit-the-spot eggs benny that makes my heart melt on a Saturday morning. 

The hilarious part? They know how to poach an egg. I've been to expensive breakfast places that can't poach an egg and I find myself yearning for futures."}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system:
5 stars = Must visit!
4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here.
3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go.
2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary.
1 star = Do not visit!


Future's has one of the best locations in Toronto, so you can't miss when it comes to having a drink on the patio. They have always served a variety of food, ranging from roasted meat, perogies, and mashed potatoes, to cheesecake and tasty desserts. What was once a beatnik-centred clientele has turned somewhat yupster, and the all-night chess games that took up the main room have been replaced by an Annex crowd that longs for sushi and frozen yogurt.

I've been here so many times with friends that 4 stars is the only natural choice, but the quality of the place is mostly deserving of a 3. The prices are average; the food is hearty or sweet - depending on which side of the restaurant you're visiting - but nothing spectacular. It is constantly busy, so do not expect speedy or exceptionally friendly service.

3 stars"}
{"text":"Not too sure what happened to this place. If you order a cake slice, the slices are now incredibly small. It used to be 3x bigger than then the slice they currently serve. They are also leaving their cakes out a lot longer! I've ordered a few slices where the cakes are incredibly dry and not that great to eat. On top of that, they also increased the costs to $5.99. I'm REALLY disappointed. I don't understand why they are skimping out on customers."}
{"text":"Ahh Futures, the classic spot for all of your cake and beer needs.  While I spend a larger amount of time at its sister bar directly attached, Labyrinth, I am still at heart a Future Bakery fan, and I have the cake/coffee punch cards to prove it.

The factor that I love about the place is that they are just so laid back.  If you walk in, plunk down on one of the comfy sofas and chill out with a newspaper, they will leave you alone until you decide to get up and go get a coffee or dessert from the cake bar, or food or beverage from the meal service register.  They will not hound you or ask you to leave.  They know that you'll spend money eventually.

The patio is one of my favorite places to be in the summertime, yes, even after one crazy night a few months ago when that shooting happened (that was fun).  Interestingly enough, the waitstaff went back out and continued serving within minutes of the shooting!  Crazy.  They know that a full patio of people would only wait for their drinks so long, shooting or no!

The cakes are awesome.  I haven't met a slice that I didn't like, the most popular seem to be the oreo cheesecake and the Phantom cake.  I am pretty fond of the carmelita cheescake too.  Maybe because they are all so delicious.  

As far as the food items go I am sad to say but I don't usually eat there unless it's patio season and I must be outside.  For the price, the food isn't all that great.  Out of anything, the breakfasts are usually a safe bet, as is the grilled cheese.  I hate their mashed potatoes as a side dish to anything but the fries are ok.  The poutine is pretty tasty and vegetarian as they use mushroom gravy, which is great when you want something veggie-friendly for yourself or to share with a friend.  The chicken wings and fries combo is also good if you're hanging out over a few pints, although their hot sauce runs pretty mild so order it hot if you normally like medium wings."}
{"text":"I remember the Future Bakery from the days on Queen Street when it was actually a bakery where you went to get bread and rolls, and which then started serving things gradually. Perhaps this biases me because I want it to be more elemental than it has become. 

The cheesecakes for which it has become famous as a late night chill out destination are really overly, cloyingly sweet. However, I don't know any better options around for the cakes and hot chocolate crowd. On the plus side, there are a ton of flavours to choose from and many people do like them!  

They have a really nice patio. The hat-wearing waiter is terrific. 
They serve beer on the patio, including a great lemon tea flavour. 

For a patio snack I ordered the sweet potato fries which came with a tasty chipotle mayo. Personally I found them to be the greasiest fries ever, which is really saying a lot. I could not keep eating them, they were so oily. The reason I ordered them is because most of the menu does not look to be gluten free, and I wanted a snack. It's really too bad that the food is lacking in quality because this place has so much potential. I would never actually come for a meal here. 

All that having been said, it is a great central location to meet friends for coffee or stop for a quick drink."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the location. The coffee urns are disgusting and they clearly have not been cleaned for ages (if ever). These machines need to be cleaned regularly. 

I ended up choosing a different coffee (less disgusting looking but still pretty gross) and it had probably been sitting there for ages because it was barely even warm - my sugar didn't dissolve. 

The chic chip cookie was pretty average and I felt that they are overpriced. If I'm paying these prices I expect better quality.

Also, I felt something sharp when I sat down. On inspection I discovered a screw that had pierced through the chair and was digging into my leg. I told the staff and they said they would inform the manager. Whether they did it not, I will not go back to find out."}
{"text":"This place is great. So far I have only been here twice and I think I'm going to keep coming here. They have a variety of food and come on who doesn't love all day breakfast? 

I don't think there's anything better then getting Eggs Benedict at 8:00 pm on a Wednesday. I feel like you definitely get what you pay for here and in some cases (almost always) get more than what you pay for. It's kind of like the 50 cent hotdogs at Ikea. Overall you've had better but they're 50 cents so they seem a lot more amazing then you would think.

They could have better waiter serves though. Better as in have more waiters. They only had one guy working the patio and one cleaning up. Although he was really sweet/nice, he seemed very distracted. He wouldn't come to us so we always had to call him over. But again if they just got 2 more waiters out there, this could have been avoided.

BTWs if you like and when I say like I really mean LOVE!!!! cheesecake, then this place is for you."}
{"text":"I went here the other day for breakfast after always passing a busy patio on my bike ride home and finally giving in to my curiosity.  Well, I wish I didn't let that cat out of the bag.

I opted for the Eggs Benedict, which for me is a tell-tale way to judge a place that serves breakfast.  It was just awful and I was totally put off by the atmosphere (which might have affected my taste buds more than it should have) but I thought the sauce was too lemony, the spinach too crispy, and the potatoes a little too \"I've been under a hot lamp for the past two hours\"-y.  I will say that the eggs were done well in terms of the right amount of runny yolk, but I really couldn't bring myself to eat more than one half of the meal.

One thing that particularly made my experience less than optimal was that I must have pulled out about 4 forks from the cutlery section before finding one that wasn't covered in opaque grey water droplets or crumbs of food.  

Also, my boyfriend got the veggie lasagna (which was huge and served with two sides) that he seemed to like but it looked lifeless to me.

This being said, I may not have ordered the right dish and had I gotten a beer and an order of french fries, maybe it would have been different.

The cheesecakes did all look amazing, but I will not be back to try them.
The portions are good and the price is right, so maybe suited for a less-discerning eater, but this is one experience I will not repeat."}
{"text":"Been here for six-seven years. Each time it gets worse. The cake is dry and the cookies are stale. They don't throw out their cakes even if it's old (you can see the cake being really dry by the edges) and will try to push it to the next person. If there's a last slice left and no one buys it, they will sell one slice off the new cake, and slide the old slice into the new cake to make people think it's a fresh. I saw this happen. And their hot food taste like microwave food.

Last I visited, there were flies and fruit flies inside the cake displays. And you can see their butter and pecan tarrts were crawling with the critters. It's only popular because it's the only place around tat serve food/dessert and opens late. It's great for hangout since they don't kick you out for sitting too long."}
{"text":"Came here because the patio and the atmosphere looked welcoming. However, once I went up to order, I received the worst service I've ever received in a restaurant. The staff person was rude, condescending, and threw my card and a pen when I asked for one. He forgot to give us what we paid for, and top of that, the kitchen made us the wrong order. We got the chili, the chicken curry, and chicken fingers (in lieu of the requested schnitzel) and they were underwhelming. I give it two stars because everyone else seemed to enjoy the place."}
{"text":"They have a lot of choices. Ordered brownie chocolate cake. Tasteless, stiff, below average. Price is high in respect to their food quality. The staff is indifferent."}
{"text":"Hit & miss depending on what you order. I once had bacon & eggs that weren't very tasty, but the last few times I've been there I have had pancakes and some sandwiches and they were much better than before.

Waiter service is only for the patio I think.

There are a lot of students here so if you like that crowd, you'll enjoy it here. It's common to find people reading or studying here too though the noise level and background music are a bit loud for that."}
{"text":"I was at Future Bistro at the end of August.

Normally, I meet a friend there and have a coffee. Like the patio. The coffee is Ok.

Never had their food before. As I was hungry I ordered Potato pancakes.
They came served with sour cream and tomato slices on the side that were not ripe...
 I started eating and discovered when I was almost finished that pancakes were half cooked.
I pointed this out to the waitress and asked her to pass this on to the chef as someone is going to get sick. 
I was in the restaurant business for some years in the past and know a thing or two about cooking.
It turned out that it was me who got sick.
I had severe food poisoning, with diarrhea that lasted 2 weeks. My back was in a severe spasms for two weeks.
After much pain in the back and stomach and a couple of hundred dollars of medical expenses I am getting better. I have also lost 3 weeks of work at my studio.
I contacted the manager Sumit at the Future bakery by email. His reply was that they never have any complaints about their food. My experience is a bit different.
Over 146 comments on Yelp about the restaurant and many are hardly glowing reviews.
So far no offer was made by the management to reimburse me for my financial losses.

Will avoid eating there like a plague in future!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years, the food is always fantastic and I just love the location and the patio in the summer time definitely one of my favourite spots."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best places to grab cake if you're in the area.  Can't beat the $5 prices and the huge availabilities of different types of cakes, pastries, etc. I always go here after dinner if I'm in the area.  I think they may have a bunch card too (buy 9 get one free) for the slices of cake."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for the last 15 years, and the place has pretty much stayed the same.  The decor  is looking a little dated/worn out, but somehow it works for the place.
However, the most important thing about this place, the food, is fantastic.  Desert selection is dangerously good!  If you like apple pie, they usually have 3 or 4 varieties to choose from, and the portions are generous. 
If you are going there for savory food, breakfast items are good, perogies are delicious, and mashed potatoes and gravy are addictive."}
{"text":"I did not try any of their cakes or desserts even though they looked delicious. I had their eggs benedict (because they didn't have the grilled chicken sandwich in the morning) and it came with fries (something I was not aware of. So the fries I didn't eat because I`m health conscious and would have preferred a substitute and the eggs benedict was the remaining option that I had from their breakfast menu. I would have preferred an egg white option of some sort or a chicken option of something. They do have an extensive menu but not for breakfast. The food was fresh and decently priced but the place lacked décor."}
{"text":"it's a hangout spot for students in the annex mainly. 

you got beer, regular dishes, and desserts all one diner style. 

the food was so-so i was expecting higher quality,  had a schnitzel and a carrot cake for dessert.


the schnitzel was tiny, literally 3cm squared. no less it was over cooked.

carrot cake, yeah sure it was a big slice but it didn't taste too fresh which was a surprise since I had hoped it would be better because people have been raving about the cakes here. 

friendly servers and good hangout spot though.."}
{"text":"Good spot to people watch on the patio on a lazy summer evening with your favorite pitcher and some good company. 

Tried some of the food options and have never really been blown away. Average at best. 

They do have a wide variety of cakes and cookies on hand, cakes are bought from other companies and sold here, not sure if the cookies and other desserts are baked on site. Regardless the cakes are generally fresh, the cookies on the other hand, are never fresh. I have never had a decent cookie from this place. A disappointment to be sure as this is a bakery after all!"}
{"text":"I walked by and saw the patio looked awesome so I bought a coffee inside and took a seat outside. Thirty seconds later the server comes behind me and says, \"Sorry, only reserved seating on the patio\" and then scampers away without even looking at me. Pretty dehumanizing.
 
So I go inside and ask the kitchen people what the deal is, since there are a lot of seats available on the patio The one guy just shrugs helplessly while the girl doesn't make eye contact with me and explains, basically, \"thems the rules.\"

Bad experience and won't be going back again."}
{"text":"Great outdoor seating..Naveem was a great server. Just chilled out with a Radler pitcher"}
{"text":"Future Bakery is a staple dessert place on Bloor street that's perfect to hang out after dinner.  You'll be sure to find something you like in their wide array of desserts.  My current favourite is the Phantom cake - a merigue cake layered with nuts, cream and chocolate.  My 2nd favourite is the strawberry shortcake.

My friends and I love coming here because of the casual, lively atmosphere and  they generally leave you alone. Even though there's a constant flow of people entering, the tables do turn around quickly so that most of the time, you can find a table readily (at least for groups of 5 or under).

They also serve food here, but I've yet to try their hot foods.

Love this place, we need more of these around the city!"}
{"text":"Futures is a great place to relax, have a bite to eat, drinks and tons of dessert options....which is normally why we're there. They have the best Cheescake in the city! Always fresh and very tasty. The white chocolate raspberry is one of our faves. It is always busy with a wide range of ages and lots of action. It is a little noisy at times but has a great vibe."}
{"text":"Like the see-through glass wall from ceiling to floor. 
Great location in the corner on one of the oldest street in Toronto. 
Cozy for an afternoon tea in chilli day.

Strong cafe latte!"}
{"text":"I seriously only come here for cakes and coffee, so that's what my review is about.  Their cakes are great - mostly cheesecakes (15+ different varieties!), some regular cakes and also pies.  They have a few vegan options available, such as banana bread, date squares, almond cookies etc. which are also yummy.  Coffee is okay, not a lot of variety but it's good enough.  Only downside to this place is that students will often camp out here for the refillable coffee and the free WiFi and that can sometimes make it hard to find a seat depending on the time of day and how unlucky you are.  This is my number #1 spot to take a date in the Annex, and if you're in the area and have a craving for something sweet, I suggest you check it out!"}
{"text":"Update: Chicken parm is definitely good, but I've had better. Comes with pretty good mashed potatoes and mostly good mushroom gravy."}
{"text":"I bought the creme brûlée cheesecake. It's delightful. The environment is young and fresh, but has more of a feel for people who are strongly into sensitive topics that are big in the news and involve various types of activism. The guy who helped me order was very quiet and didnt even know what to recommend when I asked what he personally liked. The large and high counter holding the cakes and syrups creates a barrier between the customer and business that felt unwelcoming. I could barely see the guy, and I am 6'2\". Also, they dont take debit, ATM charges $1.75 per withdrawal. Next time, I'll just take the food to go.

The patio looks promising, but indoors I feel somewhat out of place with my MacBook and jeans and dress shirt. If you enjoy Starbucks this environment is quite different despite the name. If you insist on coming here, I would suggest bringing your laptop with a full charge, outlets appear to be scarce."}
{"text":":) Man, it's hard to write reviews sometimes that reflect the place and not just the time I had there. I had a wonderful friend date but I have to toss away our lovely catch-up session and focus! 

Future is quite the cool place. Gotta say, I was a little intimidated at first because it seems like there would be many unwritten rules. But everyone that works there was super friendly so if you have a question, just ask.

Two separate counters makes things a little odd for me. I wanted something from both! What's a girl to do? Went to get the soup of the day first- vegetable. I was quite homey and delicious, coming with two slabs of cold rye bread. The guy that rang me up was kind of pushing it around though making for lots of spillage. 

Then to the other side for coffee and a cookie. The cups they give you are kind of small, is the coffee bottomless? It's self-serve and you can choose from many different types. There's a little station with milk, sugar, etc. I had the chocolate chip and peanut cookie. It was good, but not the best cookie I've ever had. Love the thought of the peanuts though!

All in all, it's a nice and comfy spot. Not always easy to get a table but as the weather gets warmer and warmer that should be less of a problem."}
{"text":"Great patio. Pretty good food. Large servings. Decent selection. Great prices."}
{"text":"Far and wide the worst food I've ever had. Huge disappointment. I've lived in the neighborhood for years and have come here for pitchers occasionally in the past. It's always been passable, cheap beer and mediocre service. Nothing special. Being that nothing else was really open me and an old friend decided to check out the food. Huge mistake. We both ordered the chicken schnitzel, and were both brought unequal portions of charred food. I have never seen food this horribly burnt served In a restaurant, and for good reason. What I thought would be the saving grace, the side dishes, were no better. The mashed potatoes were undercooked and had a really odd undistinguishable flavour and the chickpea salad was straight out of a can. It was completely inedible. To top it off, the waitress was surly, slow, and brought us what were clearly half eaten bar lemons to put on the schnitzel. She seemed to be actively avoiding our table, as she didn't come to check on our meal once. Oh, and we got to pay 36$ For the privilege. Needless to say we will not be going back. 

Seriously,  save yourselves the time, money, and stomach ache."}
{"text":"Never got a chance to try out their cakes due to a racist staff few years ago. Not sure if he still works but this is how it went. 

Me: \"Do you guys do take out?\"
The staff: (scoffs at me.)
Me: \"?? Do you guys do take out?\"
The staff: \"what?\" (scoffs at me)
Me: \"Um.. I'm wondering if you guys do take out..\"
The staff: \"What?\" (as he laughs, ignores and walks off)

Never visited this place since then. 
Honestly, not sure why he acted like a low life. I don't have a strong accent nor do I look like some alien from another planet. But even if I fall in those categories, it doesn't justify his actions. 

I'm quite surprised of their ratings. This was a few years ago so maybe the dude got fired..or maybe, the people that come here are the same kinds."}
{"text":"I remember visiting Future's for breakfast with a friend years back and it was only until recently did I notice they were open late at night. I stopped by to hang out and play some cards last Friday evening and it was a packed house. 

Future's is a nice little hang out joint. The atmosphere is a hipster vibe which is fitting for the Annex. They have a cafeteria style service, two areas, one for food and the second for coffee and desserts. 

Service was prompt, the line moved quickly for coffee. I also noticed on many tables, folks were ordering what looked like sangria! Now, I definitely have to come back. 

If you are in the Annex area, drop by and check it out yourself."}
{"text":"Came here one night when I was in Toronto with my friends. Ordered a cheeseburger and it was honestly the worst burger I've ever had in my entire life. It was so flavorless it was like it had been frozen for years. Highly disappointed and would NEVER come back."}
{"text":"I mostly go for the breakfast fare - french toast, omelettes, and of course their crepes. i strongly recommend their strawberry crepes.

my friends all rave about their oreo cheesecake (or is it oreo cake) and their bailey's irish cream cake (or cheesecake!) my boyfriend tried their white chocolate cake which looked sumptuous. 

self-serve and 10% discount for U of T students (discriminatory?!), it's the best of both worlds - picky patrons do their own thing while they do less work.

great hangout too, and it opens till quite late in the night. good old memories."}
{"text":"Stopped off for some coffee and pastries with my family.  There are 2 ordering stations and we went to the bakery part.  I don't know what the other was.  My cupcake crazed daughter claims the pink cupcake was \"really good\".  Croissant and danish were good but nothing extraordinary.    Coffee was very good.  There are about 8 different flavors to choose from.  I had the one with chocolate.  A little pricey so we were surprised to see lots of students.  Bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great prices and assortment of desserts. Yummy cappuccinos with many milk options. Open late  amazing people watching from open window seats or the patio."}
{"text":"When I was a teenager and first started hanging out in Toronto, away from the suburbs, I would come to Future's. It represented for me a hub, away from home, where bohemian freedom and individuality were alive, not squelched by fear, lethargy and money. It was a place to go and read, have a fine coffee, gaze at the glass case of gourmet cakes, or sample the hot, cheap food at the cafeteria in the back. Sometimes I just got a giant plate of garlic mashed potatoes. Other times, I'd bring a friend and we'd sit and get buzzed on the outdoor patio. It was a great summer destination. I met several people here, and read and wrote a whole lot. This is where I sat and struggled through the first 20 pages of Nietzsche, wondering how it could be true that we were all philosophers by our human nature?! This is where I tried to read, and like, free city arts rags, thinking it would make me a better writer, but never fully succeeded. There always seemed to be too much ego, big words and self-indulgence going on for it to matter much to the rest of us. At any rate, Future's was a place where I was preparing for my future, testing other molds and modes of being, and people- watching to learn how others lived and loved - both with and without much."}
{"text":"My husband and I took the kids here, and we were immediate fans. We were looking for a solid brunch before a day spent wandering around downtown, and we weren't sorry. 

The strawberry crepes were delicious. They're a bit stingy with the syrup but you really don't need much. They're sweet enough on their own. The bacon was a real mix of well done and barely cooked - which worked out well for us, because I like the former and my husband likes the latter. The fries are amazing - my two sons couldn't get enough of them, and I kept stealing them off their plates as well. 

The only complaint was about the coffee - it was very meh. I wish I could find a place with a solid brunch or breakfast that also had AMAZING coffee, but that may be asking for too much. 

Wait staff was attentive, everything was clean, and it's in a fantastic location for people watching. We will definitely be going here again!"}
{"text":"Cheap and decent breakfast! Did not mind at all. The hot chocolate was delicious. I think I'll return for dessert next time-- the cakes look delicious!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, service alright.. And they even have a sign saying \"Tips appreciated\" lol.. I dont know if they underpay the workers or what. they look like they are stressed.. i felt bad so I gave a dollar.

Tried the breakfast, it was alright.. Its a good place just to grab coffee or hangout probably but dont know about an actual meal."}
{"text":"Joined friends for breakfast on Family Day (Monday) at 9:30 am.

Pros:

Good food, choice of organic coffees, nice vibe, warm atmosphere, university student hangout.

Cons:

Overuse of disposable items, i.e. juice in a plastic cup, butter in a single-serve thingy, ketchup in a plastic take-out thingy, all even when eating in.

Neutral, but good to know:

Cafeteria style...no table service."}
{"text":"A renowned polish-owned joint on the corner of a vibrant student community.  Serving affordable dinner plates either in or outdoors.  Great place to drink beer after work and meetup.  Also have a cake corner inside with a fresh variety of sweet delights.  Throughout the day and into the night, packed with people most of the time."}
{"text":"Very busy spot in the Annex. Very cozy vibe, but the queue line is long since there is only one cashier. The slices of cake are pricey, but it's a convenient place that serves dessert and drinks into the wee hours."}
{"text":"Yeah, it works if you need something in a pinch. But the patio is generally over-crowded and under-served, and the wait staff is largely indifferent if not surly and hipster-infected. 

Food is passable, but just that."}
{"text":"As an Annex foreigner, Future was a warm welcome wagon to snack and gossip with my girlfriends. What a great place, with a casual and busy (but homey) atmosphere. Crowded, but just the right amount, we were able to drink tea and pick at one of their many delicious cakes. Tremendous cheese cake selection! The cookies and other sweet treats all looked amazing, as did everything else Future has to offer.

There was some beer drinking / mashed taters and meat eating happening beside us that looked just as appetizing. 

Future seems to offer a cool combination of hot meals, alcoholic beverages, desserts, coffee and tea. And although we stayed inside to avoid the snow, the corner patio and sliding windows would be just great in the summer."}
{"text":"If you're into flavourless cafeteria food you'll love this place. Pretty disappointing after grabbing some breakfast here on the weekend. My gf ordered scrambled eggs and we weren't even sure if they were in fact eggs. Not only were our meals extremely bland, it took forever! You'd think they could turn out a couple of descent egg dishes in under 25 mins... 

On the the next one."}
{"text":"Decent place. My friend and I sat out by the patio on a sunny day which was nice. The sangria pitchers are great but the food was just alright. I ordered a pound of wings and my friend ordered perogies - both were just okay, it was like your typical bar food. 

Wished we had room to try out the dessert- maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Future has a laid-back hipster student vibe to it.  There is an early bird breakfast which starts at 8 AM. For $5.95 pre-tax it gets you only 3 eggs, home fries, toast & bottomless coffee/tea.  

How you order is confusing if you've never been here. As you enter there is a counter to your right and a bar/counter in the back left. For desserts, baked goods & coffee beverages go to the right and food at the back. Once you've ordered find a seat & they will shout out your order at least that's what they did for me when I ordered my breakfast.  It's pretty much self-serve. There may be some table service later for lunch and dinner, not quite sure. 

The breakfast was so far below average--overcooked eggs, mushy home fries & very dry stale toast. It's like a 13 year old was making brekkie or something. Coffee was decent though and so are the store bought desserts. Students mainly come here for the cheap meals and beer...yes, they serve alcohol and have a great big patio to get shit faced with your friends and rave about the awesome crapolla food."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped for a quick bite at Future Bistro last Sat after a boiling hot salsa party at Trinity-St.Paul. We were craving cold beer and Future was right next to our parking spot, so we decided to stop there and have a few drinks. Unfortunately, my husband convinced me to have some food, so we ordered eggplant parmesan and smoked salmon sandwiches. The food was totally inedible, eggplant tasted like rubber and smoked salmon had dark dry edges and looked like it was on somebody else's sandwich before. Mashed potatoes had bluish colour, the only thing I liked food-wise was ciabatta bread (in the sandwiches) and gravy. The beer was fine, but selection was limited. Service was good, the waiter was friendly and almost apologetic for the quality of food, so we ended up leaving a good tip. We will certainly not be back there, next time we are in the area we'll try Poutineville next door."}
{"text":"The Carrot Cake and (red eye) coffee I had was pretty okay (one star for that), but the WIFI is the worst I have ever used in ages. This place is also not a good one to study in; it is really loud. I wanted to finish writing a code, but the internet connection was so slow that I could not even connect to the server."}
{"text":"Your map of regular diners in To should include Future. In among trendier bars and resto's, they still have the $2 student specials like a massive plate of mashed potatoes with gravy that you won't find anywhere else. Basic cafeteria style service where you have to watch everyone else to figure out, but once you get it, chow down and move along.
They even have an AYCE perogie night which is kind of fantastic if you are in the mood for carbs loaded with more carbs. 
The dining area is spacious enough and if you are eating solo it is a great spot to meld into the background scenery (70s style wood) and din. Nobody will judge at Future. 
I had the breakfast which was eggs benny with ham, nothing fancy, just like To personified."}
{"text":"Just wrapped a lunch date at Future's so I thought it would be a good idea to tell y'all how it went while the experience is fresh in my mind.

I love Future's patio. In the summer, it's probably one of my favourite patios in Toronto.

The food is decent, but what is amazing about the food is the variety. Whether you want a chicken dinner, a crepe, pancakes, a salad, a sandwich, dessert or just a speciality coffee, Future Bakery has got it all.

The service is excellent. The people workin' the food are always delightful and they hook you up. My plate was piling over, just the way I like it ;)

The prices are reasonable- I had a gigantic plate of food for $7.

My only complaint about Future's is the cleanliness. The water glasses are never clean and I often see bits of bits on the food I'm eating. Plus people smoke on the patio, which I *hate*."}
{"text":"Combine two of my favourite things (cake and beer) and I'm there with bells on.

The atmosphere inside is warm and casual. It can get a bit crowded depending on the night, but it usually never gets super loud or rowdy. Food coma I guess.  

They have a wide variety of brews on tap. Nothing to write home about, but the standard Ontario team plus some European exports makes me more then happy. The cake options are pretty variable (I went with some sort of heart stopping chocolate number) but they also have other deserts available, but I'd go for the cake.

Not sure if they have it anymore but they used to have these little cards where if you ate 10 pieces of cake, you get the 11th free! Weeeeee!"}
{"text":"Dropped in on my once every five year visit and not much has changed. Still an above ground hole in the Annex and still very busy. Not a place I would go or like to admit I go, and not on any list of any kind I would have. So why 3 stars.... because this place is what it is and it does it well. A great hang out, meeting place and cheap.  Think about it, where would all these people go if this place closed."}
{"text":"Typical student hang-out, able to hang out for long periods of time without anyone rushing you out the door. The cakes are EXCELLENT, the cookies & coffee are just fine but not out of this world (they do have organic and fair trade options, which is nice, it would be great if all options were fair trade & organic but it doesn't appear to be the case).

The best thing about this place is the patio in the summer time and the comfort food they serve (i.e. perogies!). Their food is also nothing to write home about but it's cheap and it does the job, also their beer selection is pretty good! 

Overall it's a good, casual neighbourhood place but not really worth going too far out of your way to check it out."}
{"text":"This was a regular hangout for me when I was a student at UofT often seeking a good breakfast for the morning after. When I joined the workforce and moved out of the neighbourhood I retained fond memories but didn't visit. So while I did know that the other future bakeries were history,I didn't know this one was now the future bistro. 

That, however, might be the only change. Still the best all day breakfast, and could it possibly be the same price I paid in 1993? Tea and coffee that's not fancy but just good. A case full of the most tempting pastries and cakes that probably still beckon the weak-willed out of bed or out of the library for a nibble of something sweet and really good. Besides, you can bring your books and linger; they won't mind. But I hope you don't need quiet to study...

Service continues to be pleasant and friendly. A welcome departure from the common toronto snootypusses. Alas, the servers all look like babies to me now.

I glad I've rediscovered it."}
{"text":"An Annex staple. I've been here a number of times over the years and came for  breakfast here recently. The place is a hybrid cafe / breakfast / greasy spoon kinda place. 

I got the chicken parmesan sandwich with soup on the side. There as some confusion with my order about whether I was allowed to get soup as the side. They tried to charge me for both soup and sides. Misunderstanding on both sides I suppose. 

My partner had her usual order of eggs Benedict. She was not a fan. Bad / weirdly spiced hollondaise that was super runny. She was quite disapointed. 

After all that I'm willing to try Futures again but I would probably recommend sticking to the standards or the pastry."}
{"text":"This spot has a great atmosphere which is causal and fun to be in. In each corner there is something for all crowds. It has the option for drinks , food, dessert and coffee."}
{"text":"When I use to live downtown, I passed by this place several times and never really got around to this place until now. I was greeted by a nice young gentleman and was told to sit anywhere I like. Since it was patio weather I grabbed a seat outside, under some shade. The friendly server ( his hair do reminded me of Goro from Mortal Kombat) came around with water and gave me a couple of minutes to decide what I wanted to order. I couldn't make up my mind but Goro recommended the chicken schnitzel which came with mashed potatoes and a pesto pasta salad. When the food arrived, it looked kind of bland but I dove right in any way and the first thing I tasted was the pasta salad and it was delicious. Then I tried the mashed potatoes and it was a little thicker and less creamy but with the side of mushroom gravy it went down a lot better. Now the chicken schnitzel was nothing special, it tasted like a bigger version of a chicken finger and it was tough to cut through. Goro happened to come by and check on me to see if everything was okay and thats exactly what it was.. Okay. Through out the day, I was getting stomach aches and thats a symptom I get, when food is fried and the oil hasn't been changed in awhile. I prefer coming to Future Bistro for drinks and apps since thats what many of the people were doing but not for a entrée."}
{"text":"Friend and I decided to come here for brunch because the reviews here seem alright. My experience today was bad. The cashier was super impolite, pretty much threw my credit card back at me when she realized I didn't input tips in the POS. I was trying to dig out cash in my purse! if we are going to be technical, why should I give tips for a cashier that just stands there, takes payment and do nothing else for me? The restaurant was a chaos, no server/waiter at all, your name gets called when your food is ready. They yell really loud too, like you're in kindergarten again. 
Though, i can see why some people like this place, it's fairly cheap ($9.95+tax for eggs Benedict), coffee is refillable. 
For me, 100% would not come back to experience the chaos again, not worth it."}
{"text":"I wish I would spend more time on Bloor Street so that I could stop by here more often. (Cause so far I have only been here once.. )
One of my girlfriends introduced me to this cafe when we were looking for a nice place to hang out after we had some sushi down the street.

I really liked Future the second I came through the door.
The interior is inviting with comfortable seating options, but the first thing you see are their cakes and bakery items.

It was after 8pm and they still had about 8 amazing looking cakes on display as well as several different pastries and cookies.
A cake slice is $5 which is a good deal for the size, but we were up for something lighter, so us three girls only got one cookie each.
We also ordered one coffee and two mugs of hot apple cider.
We got everything within a minute. The girl behind the counter was super efficient and nice.

Of course, the coffee was mine and it was nice, however once I smelled (and tasted) my friends' apple cider I wished I had ordered that.
It is amazing.
The cookies were also really yummy.

I really want to go back some time to try one of their cheesecakes.
And to drink some hot apple cider. ;)"}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad, but nothing great. The desserts are all pre-packed and have that weird chemical taste to them.  The cafe acts more like a dispensary of sweets (i.e. nothing is made there). The food is also most likely not made there.  Basically it's like eating at a fast food place, but with way better atmosphere. The place is large and there are plenty of areas to sit (no free wifi). It caters mostly to a student crowd, so there is usually a lot of good chatter and noise going on, which makes for a nice atmosphere. 
This is more of a place to go if you're a student and need to work on a group project and possible chow down some food real quick!"}
{"text":"Although the name of the business clearly states bakery and cafe I see this place as more of a night life patio bar to frequent. I've been here on numerous occasions and had the time of my life. Such an awesome atmosphere. Wish there was more places like it around the city. Well to be fair, there probably are... they just continue to go undiscovered by me thus far.

Prices are good, service... service? What service!? Oh yeah! I forgot this place has close to the worst service I've encountered in Toronto :S But it only deserves to lose one star for it since the rest of the experience makes up for it."}
{"text":"A decent place to hang in the Annex for a super casual drink, coffee or dessert.  Very roomy - double the space with the full-serve patio open in the summer.  It's self-serve indoors.  There are some semi-clean, semi-sketchy couches that are super comfy for groups in the back.  The garage door style open store front is fun for people watching while sipping on a large pitcher of sangria ($18.95 - was more like drinking juice, but still very yummy) with the gal pals.

The dessert counter is overflowing with delicious cake that are wonderful eye-candy.  All that cream really isn't for me though!  I'm not very appreciative of the perogies and other related cafeteria-style, heavy lunch/dinner food either.  I come here for the chill atmosphere mostly.  It's a good place just to casually unwind with a drink in my hand and not have to shout to be heard."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for lunch at around 1:30pm.  The place was busy but not completely full.  This was our first time here and we didn't know that we had to order/pay/pick up from the counter. This restaurant serves a huge variety of food from schnitzel to sausages to burgers and sandwiches.  They also have a variety of beers on tap and in cans for you to choose from!

We ordered a ham & swiss sandwich, homemade borscht soup and the grillwurst sausage entree.  Portions were all very big and it was all tasty.  The soup was amazing and I would highly recommend it!  Prices are definitely high for this very casual restaurant.  The employee behind the counter was helpful and friendly, but nothing over the top.

To end, good food, good service, overpriced."}
{"text":"Good desserts. Decently priced foods.
So far, no sodium overload.
Coffee and tea are not my favorite at the place but they get the job done.
Opens early, closes late.
Great circulation.
Friendly atmosphere. 
And patios! !!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant last summer . Just can't get it out of my mind . Wish they had a place like this near my house .  The food was yummy and the our waitress , Nikki , was outstanding . Met the manager and saw how wonderful she is . Guess we have to go back to Toronto ( from NYC ) , so we can enjoy going to this place."}
{"text":"Great patio and friendly atmosphere in the Annex. The menu has many good choices, healthy options, breakfast all day served, and excellent prices. I ordered the soup of the day combo with the house salad, and my husband ordered sausages, sauerkraut and mashed potatoes, family style dishes and homemade feeling. For dessert they have many pies and cakes, we have the apple pie and it was delicious. A great choice in the neighborhood. Our waitress was super nice.
The washrooms are located downstairs, I have never seen so many flies in a bathroom."}
{"text":"I've eaten here on and off over the years. It's been a first date location many times! ha! Good food, great treats and a great selection of teas and/or booze. Prices are pretty reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Surprised this bar atmosphere had 20 different types of cakes to choose from!!! Tried the crime brûlée cheese cake was so good. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went in for dessert - Poor and slow service. Cakes tend to be good at Future BUT the slices are too think and it's overpriced !"}
{"text":"i love futures.  not for their packed evenings.  or their disgusting washrooms.
but because it is THE spot to be a student in the annex.
come alone with a book or with a group and order an unhealthy amount of cake.
you can spend hours at this student haunt and feel like you're back in university.  good times are definitely to be had here at all hours of the day.

for those of you from vancouver, I call this my \"Toronto Calhoun's\""}
{"text":"I almost feel like Future Bakery should have a separate rating for it's cake. 

The cake is incredible. Huge slice for a relatively affordable price (give or take 6 quid). 

The actual food is mediocre though and the staff is really hard to decide on. One visit they'll be great and the next, pretty snobby. 

One huge no-no for a cafe though is they don't have Wi-Fi. NOT the kind of place you want to go to on your own to try and be productive, but a really nice 'group of friends' or brunch kind of joint."}
{"text":"I just love this place!

breakfast and dinner and lunch food - check!
desserts - check!
patio - check!
couches at the back of the room - check!

the best way to spend a summer day here - with a beer or ice cream at the patio

the best way to spend a winter day here - with a cup of hot chocolate and chocolate fudge cake on a soft couch.

there is such a huge variety of cakes that I still don't know if I tried even 1\20 of the whole offered set. ah yumminess!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, always have enjoyed the desserts. The food is definitely filling, and I love that you get salads with the sandwiches. Pretty decent bang for your buck. Can be tricky to find a seat for more than two though."}
{"text":"This place is famous for their deserts and breakfast.

Their pies are awesome, all berry, sour cherry, pecan, strawberry are all amazing.

They have cheese cake too, not as good as the pie.

They fall on the overprice side of restaurants, sometimes the staff were not very nice to customers."}
{"text":"Food was tasty and cheap,although it took me awhile to figure out you have to go to the counter and order lol. I wanna come back and try the all you can eat pierogies on Wednesdays. I've never seen that before!"}
{"text":"Future Bakery is good place for working professionals like me to get all nostalgic about the university years. Ironically enough I have to go to a place named future bakery to revisit the past.

This rambling cafe is awash with students at all open hours, some studying, others eating, and then some out for sheer fun on a date or with friends. It's a just a relaxing place to crash after class or after a strenous study session at one of UofT's lovely libraries.  The food is a bit iffy here though I do come here for the perogies and mashed potatoes (read: cheap and filling). Also if I'm in a dessert state of mind this is one of my top spots to hit up as they have an excellent selection of cakes and pies: my favourites being the oreo cheesecake or the chocolate banana cake. 

2 1/2 stars for the food
4 stars for the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Came here to catch up with friends. We were here for hours and no one said anything about how long we were hogging a table (WHICH IS AWESOME). We ordered dinner and then dessert and coffee/tea afterwards. When you walk in, it's a bit disorienting because there's two different counters (one in the back-left for food and one to the right with dessert and coffee). The food is delicious and reasonably priced. I had the Chicken Schnitzel with the mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy and chick pea salad. Everything was delicious. I also tried a couple different cakes (a raspberry cheesecake and a chocolate cake). They were both delicious. It's not the fanciest place, but it's all delicious, unpretentious and down-to-earth. It's also super busy and popular as the night goes on, definitely a happening venue!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! I've only had the cakes and cheesecakes here but I have had so many of them and love them all!

I highly recommend this place for celebratory desserts because they are great but too expensive for a regular day"}
{"text":"Pretty good cakes and a good cafe to meet friends or grab a tea. I don't think Futures has wi-fi though which makes it not the best study spot...not to mention it's usually quite loud. But, the cakes are tasty and it's nearby so it's somewhere I'll certainly keep frequenting."}
{"text":"Went here for dessert after supper. The cakes are great and the atmosphere laid-back, comfy, and friendly. A great place to take a date for dessert."}
{"text":"I have seen the future and it works...sort of.

While walking along Bloor at 11:30pm, my wife and I came across restaurant after restaurant, closed.

Nataraj? Closed. Assorted thai places, closed.

Too tired after our flight and airport experience to wander elsewhere, we continued along Bloor and found signs of life.

And behold, a patio filled with people, a bakery with more people and a free table outdoors with our name on it.

That was the easy part-- receiving menus and having our order taken was a lengthy wait.

One other slight irritant came in the form of outdoor smoking. It seemed like everyone at every table was lighting up. Coming from NYC this was a slight surprise and reminded me of the (un)enlightened days when one could smoke in a bar. This isn't really the restaurant's fault but is worth mentioning when describing the environment.

The patio had a relaxed feel to it, as if one could linger there with friends for hours at a time discussing the world's problems.

Once our order was in, the plates came flying out and my stuffed cabbage rolls were on the mark. Filled with rice and ground beef, topped with tomato sauce and housed in cozy cabbage. My wife and I split an order of poutine and this was also a tasty addition to the meal. Portions were hefty and no room was left for dessert.

The most surprising part of the experience was the damage, although it hardly qualifies as damage- $23 for the cabbage rolls, poutine and my wife's knockwurst platter. That's a steal while factoring in the tax too.

To borrow from a popular 80's movie title- I will go \"Back to the Future\"."}
{"text":"If the large breezy patio of Future Bistro tempts you, as it did for me, keep in mind that location might be the only redeeming feature of this place. The cakes are quite dry, food greasy, bland and overpriced for the quality and the tea is cheap grocery store variety sold for a premium. Maybe a good place to have a beer and catch up with a friend, but I'd steer clear of the food next time."}
{"text":"I used to go this cafe a lot when I lived in the Annex and I loved the place. However, I went there earlier this week and was bitterly disappointed. We ordered a pitcher of Sangria that was undrinkable; we literally left 3/4th of it unfinished. It was too sweet and tasted like it was made with some sort of processed fruit juice that comes out of a tetra pack. We also ordered two slices of cake: one blackout and one red velvet cheesecake. While the latter was passable, I basically couldn't even finish the blackout- it was dried out and tasted old and stale. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"THE CAKES WERE AMAZING.
My friend and I had a hard time picking which ones that we wanted to try cuz everything looked 10/10. I went with the bailey's cheesecake and it was $6.50 per slice. I could really taste the strong bailey flavour and it was a great combination together with the cheese. The cake itself was not overwhelmingly sweet but it was kinda dense and heavy. Even though we just each ordered one slice of cheesecake, the girl who served us still took her time and drew a beautiful music note with some chocolate syrup on the plate. I really appreciate these small details.
The place was pretty big with plenty of tables. We came on a bright Saturday afternoon and there were people studying, working and reading in the cafe/bistro. I would definitely want to come back again to try their pistachio cheesecake next time"}
{"text":"Nice place but really disappointed by the rules I shouldn't have to stay inside because I order inside you can make sure I won't go back beside that it's still a nice place but I shouldn't have to choose who I order from to be able have my drink outside"}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop into in the morning if I've found myself getting to work a little too early (it happens), and to just sit down with a book and a cup of coffee and relax.

HUGE portions- definitely for sharing or eating for two or three different meals. The grilled chicken and chicken parm sandwiches are great, they both last at least two meals. I've also had their breakfast (get the french toast, you won't be sorry!) which is served all day. As mentioned by other reviewers, the desserts are great, and the coffee is delicious too.

The patio looks tempting as I walk to work every day, I've never actually had time to sit down and enjoy it, but it seems like a fun crowd. 

The menu is varied and reasonably priced, the wait staff is pretty nice. Food isn't phenomenal, but it's pretty good. It's a good place to stop into if youre feeling famished and want something that'll fill you up.

It's cash only, but there's an ATM inside."}
{"text":"The menu is just varied enough to welcome a bit of adventure (I had a bruschetta omlette, an interesting offering, and at 5pm besides!), and it all seems well done enough. It's not trying to be a high-class restaurant, and as a comfortable patio-centric joint certainly hits the mark. Beer is reasonable (if not cheap), liquor is definitely cheap ($4.75 for rail, $7.50 for a double), and wine is forgettable.

Future's focus really is on coffee and baked goods, which are almost universally excellent.

There isn't much to say, really, it's a solid choice at any time of day. The patio is huge, if crowded and has the occasional douchebag who leans his chair too far back and keeps bumping in to you and never apologizing and ashing his cigar over your bag in the seat beside you...but that might be an isolated incident."}
{"text":"Don't come here expecting good food, don't come here expecting good service. Definitely don't come here expecting reasonable prices.
Come here for a slice of cake and a glass of water and a pretty decent place to hang out for a few hours that is not your typical bar."}
{"text":"my feelings are a bit mixed on this one. 

lots and LOTS of good memories here. great pastry, lots of choices. awesome to bring friends for a chat or go on a date so you can stare at eachother over candle light and share a slice with the same fork. 

problem is they have cockroaches.. or DID at some point. I just don't even go close to the food counter now (dessert counter's on the other side of the room and as i see it... maybe safe). the only time i ordered there, I watched a cockroach crawling across the food counter inches from my plate. ewwww."}
{"text":"I checked out Future Cafe on a weekday evening. My friend recommended the place to me for their large dessert selection. Nothing more needed to be said at that point; I had to go check out this dessert haven.

And I was not disappointed! There are many cakes to choose from! cheesecakes, mousse based, fruit, tiramisu..they were beautiful to look at (my dessert addiction is starting to show!) There was also other dessert options, like cookies, brownies, many other treats. 

My friend and I settled on sharing a slice of raspberry-mango cheesecake. It was a fairly large sized slice. The prices here are so friendly, $5.99 a slice. The cake was delicious, I'm not going to lie and say its the best quality out there, but comparable to something you would have at William's Coffee or Second Cup.

I ordered an apple cider to drink-don't recommend, way over-sweetend. My friend had a peppermint tea, which is hard to review (its a teabag in hot water...can't really go wrong with that combo).

The atmosphere was lively but relaxed. Very casual, lots of room, you just seat yourself. I would feel comfortable spending a couple hours here (which we did) chatting, working on my laptop, just relaxing. 

The best part is this place is open late. 12am weeknights, I think later on the weekend. If you are looking for an alternative to the bar, check this place out.

ps. be sure to pick up a cake and/or coffee card. 9 purchases and the 10th is free! As if this place was not already a bargain :)"}
{"text":"I went here last year to watch a friend play in a band and it was really great - that kind of hip, beatnik U of T hot-spot that smells bad and is filled with really pensive, existential college kids getting drunk and soaking up homegrown tunes. It's definitely a place to get check out if you want to head back down memory lane. 

The drinks are pretty cheap and the music is local and surprisingly good. It's a random crowd in this house sometimes but that's what makes it so much fun. 

For an authentic post-secondary party, Future Bakery is where it's at."}
{"text":"A gorgeous patio, cool evening and awesome colourful exterior has beckoned me in on this cozy stretch of Annex cafes.  

As a BlogTO fan I consulted their top 11 (Why 11 and not 10?) Sangria spots @ http://www.blogto.com/toronto/the_best_sangria_in_toronto/ and Future Bakery came in at #10.  I really hope the higher ranked 9 are better.  This was the worst Sangria I've ever had if it could be indeed called Sangria; I disagree with the classification as such.  I'd like to know if there is any wine in this thing at all; I simply do not believe it.  It looks more like a shitty cocktail from a tourist trap, the triple colour/layer of sugar water and no fruit could not possibly be Sangria.  It's a pitcher of sugar and no flavour.  I heard several other complaints about the same; we left it unfinished.  Disappointing because it seems to be a specialty and highly advertised in chalk.  

I'll be back for the patio, but I'll stick with drinks they can't ruin."}
{"text":"The desserts do not disappoint! Future's cheesecakes are amazing and their Truffle Royale is to die for! Salads were a bit bland. Desserts were pricey. However, the quality of Future's food (especially their cakes!) make up for the prices. Will definitely be coming back again to try out more of their amazing cakes!"}
{"text":"Futures and I have had our ups and downs over the years.  It's been a love-hate-love-hate sort of thing.

We first met in the summer.  Futures has a gorgeous patio.  Always filled with happy people and summery drinks, I found myself enjoying coming here on a regular basis.  Service was slow, but hey, it was a cool spot, and I was willing to overlook some faults in this stage of the relationship.

Eventually came the nachos test.  They were awful.  I can't specifically remember what it was, but I vowed never to mention them in Future's vicinity again, and for years I didn't.  But I thought, hey, why not try breakfast?  Also awful.  The eggs were mediocre.  Nothing else was all that impressive.  0 for 2.  I decided Futures was a place to grab coffee and the occasional beer.

Time passed, and while there with some friends, the topic of food came up.  Chicken fingers.  Why not, I thought.  They were good.  I was surprised.  I actually liked something not in liquid form at Futures.  In time, I came to find other good items on the menu.

The moral here is that Futures has a lot to offer.  Not all of it is up to snuff.  But there are things that are worth coming back for."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon with some friends. Food came out fairly quick, although for some reason my sandwich took longer than the other more complicated orders. The eggplant Parmesan sandwich was good, although a little dry.

The desserts here are incredibly tempting. A great selection of cheesecakes that I found hard to resist. However, the lightness of my wallet helped me endure. I might go back again if asked, but I wouldn't come running. That said, if you want to treat yourself to some delicious sweets, look no further."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Future's since I was a student at UofT. It's a great place to catch up with a couple of friends over food and cake. It works like fast food restaurants, where the menu is hung above the counter. You order & pay and then wait for your food to be ready before you take a seat. Once you're finished, you dump your plates in a small bin to be cleaned. Definitely not the best place to go if you're looking to impress your date with something fancy.

The food overall is good but not mind blowing. It's made pretty quick although I personally believe the price is pretty high. At the same time, the food portion is very generous.

My favourite thing about Future's is the cake selections. Their cake is always worth the price and very fresh. The strawberry cheesecake is AMAZING."}
{"text":"Future is quite possibly one of the best places to hang out in the annex on a chill evening (no not the cold chill - I'm trying to be hip here)! I really like ambience of the cafe and they have a wide variety of decent foods (mostly for brunch - not that bad) and most importantly a large selection of cakes and coffee's. 

They have organic coffee's which is pretty cool and they try to add unique personality to the place with their colourful mugs and plates and decor. 

As soon as patio season hits, make sure you can get a spot at Future as it fills up fast. It is a cafe so there's no table service, just quickly grab a seat before you get your food!

Future isn't anything absolute special or amazing but it has good desserts in a nice place, and that makes for a good time!"}
{"text":"This is a jack of all trades places. Anytime of the day you can get any type of meal.  All day breakfasts, deli, hot meals, bakery, coffee, indoor seating, outdoor seating, coffee, beer, drinks, you name it.

The inside is very cozy and warm and has a comfortable ambiance.

The pancakes are amazing."}
{"text":"Picture yourself on a patio on bloorrrrr, with veal shnitzel treeeeeeees and mashed potato skiiiiiiiiies, suddenly someone is there with varenikas, the hippie chick with mushroom gravy on the side.... 

hmmm.  (dont even ask my why i felt the need...)

the thing that is futures.  its a cafe that is filled with many different folks, lots of university students, bloor street loafers, families and someone who knows a good borscht when they smell one.  I always get the shnitzel.  it is very large, fresh, and heavenly with the mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy.

and if i can, as most people would, ill eat it on the patio.  its a very large one that is covered in total with a huge awning.  maybe you cant even call it that.  maybe its technically a roof.  but its a great corner to people watch; its right in the centre of the spadina and bathurst street strip and very very chill.

ive also munched on desserts, and warmed up to some teas and enjoyed coming over to the cafeteria bar they have with daily specials as an alternative to looking at a menu.  there doesnt seem to be any designation for smokers on the patio so keep that in mind as they can sit anywhere."}
{"text":"I have always loved this place, since my days at U of T back in the 90's.  The go to spot for coffee, pasties and hanging out in the Annex.  Met a friend here last week on Saturday afternoon.  Started off with a hot apple cider, just what i needed on cold afternoon.  For lunch I had chili, she had smoked salmon on bagel with chick pea salad and mashed potato.  Food really good.  I had large piece of decadent chocolate cake for desert.

Funky atmosphere, full of students and Annex residents, great pastries.  A local gem."}
{"text":"We went to Future Bistro, thinking it was Future Bake Shop, hoping to get breakfast and some loaves of bread - and it's not!   It used to be a location for Future Bake shop.  I'll say it again - this is *not* Future Bake Shop.  :-)

Anyway - decided to stay and try breakfast.  Honestly - wish we hadn't.  Despite the great prices for breakfast, I was disappointed.  Everything was cold and tastless.  My feta and spinich omellette had exactly one bit with Feta cheese in it.  My potato wedges looked great - but were cold and stale.  My toast?  Cold...and to add to it, so was the butter, so I couldn't even spread it on the toast.   Coffee was boring and unsatisfying, even the so-called dark roasts.   I left most of my meal and my coffee - wasn't worth eating.   Very disappointed - it's hard to blow breakfast.

Decor is great.  Pastries in display look great.  Guy behind the breakfast bar as wonderful - cheerful and helpful.   But the food was not to my taste.

Would I return:  No.
Would I recommend:  No."}
{"text":"BEST CHEESECAKE. friendly service. the savoury stuff is nice but desserts are the best thing about this place."}
{"text":"Been here a few times - the vibe is pretty cool.  It's pretty hard to pull off a cafe/bar where you can feel equally comfortable drinking coffee or beer.  And you do all-you-can-eat perogies (Thursday night) or just have a piece of cake.

The patio is quite large and do take advantage of the early bird breakfast/brunch specials (before 11AM daily) and it's damned cheap breakfast.

I didn't rate it higher because I ordered a schnitzel which was sadly both small and dry.  Probably shouldn't have ordered it at a place like this - but if it's going to be crap, why have it on the menu?

But still not bad for being all things to all people, really."}
{"text":"The only time I'm here is late at night when I'm hit with a craving for cake. I know there will always be a glass case full of cake and pie waiting for me to choose from, even when all the other dessert places are already long closed. The last time I was here was on a Sat night at around 11pm, after being kicked out of a Gelato shop that was closing. The place was almost full of people just chatting and hanging out, a welcoming relaxed atmosphere to step into.

I got a slice of raspberry lemon cheesecake which completely fulfilled my cake craving.  The counter service was quick and friendly, with part of it being self serve which is nice because you don't have to wait to be seated or to get water or to grab an extra fork to share cake with."}
{"text":"Came here looking for some dessert after a meal near by.

What we ate:
- Bailey's cheese cake (2/5) Just tasted like mascarpone with vanilla flavouring
- Chocolate cake (0/5) Horrible and stale
- Raspberry explosion (3/5) My friends seemed to enjoy this one the most
- Coffee (1/5) Tasted like your typically water down affair. They get 1 star for serving it in actually coffee mugs.

I will not be back. Eek."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to go out for pie and visited Future Bistro after reading all the positive reviews. Quite frankly, I'm disappointed! The reviews were so good but my own experience was quite sour. We ordered 2 slices of apple crumble pie. It was cold! The staff member didn't offer to warm it up for us. It was like a morcel of pie for $6.40. I ordered a lemon tea along with my pie (and she asked if I wanted any honey on the side). The boyfriend ordered a vanilla chai latte. He said the latte was excellent. 

Overall, I'm just bitter that I spent like $13.00 on a tiny, cold slice of pie. What a poor experience :( Who likes cold pie?"}
{"text":"Although I'm no longer a student, anytime I feel nostalgic, I go to Future Cafe and see students stressed out , heads hanging over books and suddenly I no longer feel nostalgic. Instead I sit back and enjoy the paper, one of the cafes massive cookies and a cup of herbal tea.

Situated dead smack in the Annex, this is the quintessential cafe of choice because it's large inside and out (the patio is quite popular come summer), and it serves not only coffee and cookies but real food from a separate section in the back. 

My only complaint is that sometimes tables are hard to come by because people stay for so long, and I have yet to sit at a clean table. But hey, that sort of thing never bothered me when I was a student..."}
{"text":"I don't understand this place's legendary status. The food is disgusting (the eggs are somehow greasy, overcooked, AND and soggy at the same time), they don't even bake the cakes on site, and the service is non-existence. My guess is people keep coming back to reminisce on their time as students, because beyond that there's not much this place has to offer."}
{"text":"Had eggs benedict and beer on a Friday night. Great location and pretty good service, cool vibe. Benedict wasn't exactly hot and fresh, but can't say I was really there for the food. Maybe I'll try the pierogies next time."}
{"text":"What more can I add to the slew of reviews for this place? It's apparent that Future Bakery is one of Toronto's much loved and welcoming institutions.

Back when I was college student and lived in the Annex, I used to visit Future Bakery to enjoy cheap coffee refills, spend a few uninterrupted hours of reading my book or chat with friends. Fast forward a few years and that picture hasn't changed.

Over the years, Toronto has welcome a slew of trendy coffeehouses but I can always rely on Future Bakery for being no-nonsense and dependable. While the food on the menu can get pricey but how can I go wrong with a grilled cheese sandwich or an all-you-can perogies special?

In the summer months, their patio is one of the best in the neighbourhood, always packed and perfectly enjoyed while sipping a nice cold beer. In the winter months, see this place buzzing with patrons wanting a warm beverage to heat their souls."}
{"text":"I've been to this place about a zillion times. It's a really convenient go-to spot if you need a place to hang out around Bloor & Spadina: open late, lots of seats, casual atmosphere (the staff doesn't really seem to care if you hang out indefinitely as long as you behave yourself). I haven't eaten much there, to be honest, but the soup of the day is actually pretty good and of course there's the famous cakes that everyone else here reviews. I find them pretty good and have tried a few different varieties over the years; no disappointments. I enjoy window-shopping the pastry case to see what's new. The coffee is...well, it's ok. But really, my review is more for the ease and the convenience of the place. I'm glad it's there and hope it continues to be for some time."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a chill cafeteria style breakfast spot this is it. Overhead menus hang over the counter where you order, grab a table and wait for your order to be called. Bottomless coffee is available which makes it easy to stay for a while. While I've only gone for breakfast Future has a gigantic desert display and a decent alcoholic beverage menu, making it a quaint destination for drinks and other sweet treats. Will definitely be heading back soon to check out the evening vibe."}
{"text":"My second goto place for a rich and decadent dessert without breaking the bank.   For only $6 a slice plus tax, get the cake or pie you wish for from over 50+ choices!!!   Who needs The Cheesecake Factory?   My go to cake: the light airy and decadently sweet Super Caramel Crunch cake."}
{"text":"I don't want to be THAT reviewer, but honestly, the cake I had tonight was trash garbage. I got a slice of Stawberry shortcake, which tasted awful. The \"white chocolate\" tasted like kids makeup, the cream wasn't much better, and it was more like a weird strawberry jam-jelly situation, instead of fresh strawberries. 

All around just a very poor quality, bad tasting, sad excuse kind of cake. I'm pretty disappointed, and I'm annoyed I spent $6.78 on a slice of trash."}
{"text":"Holy Moses! This food was delicious. We were terrible people and marched in with a group of 20 but they were quick to put us out on the patio and nailed the service. They were so fast. The food was delicious, especially the perogies (pierogies). Gotta love a place that serves mashed potatoes and gravy or can wedges instead of fries!!!"}
{"text":"Had a quick tea from here, not much can go wrong with that. Disappointed that they don't offer wifi for those visiting like myself. The explanation offered was that if they offered wifi people would stay the irony of which was lost on the server since I would have sat down for food had they offered wifi. Funny I can get wifi in Loblaws nowadays but god forbid I had wifi in a cafe that might get me to stay and consumer more. Could really do without the attitude."}
{"text":"What else can be said about futures? well, sure it's loud, lacks sufficient couching, makes subpar coffee, and has no wifi. But somehow it has been a go-to date place for so long.. maybe because its open late enough on a weeknight and is near my house :P

Well it does have some redeeming qualities. It's fantastic for people watching. And they do have a nice patio in the summer. Also, they actually have some half-decent beers on tap.. last time I was there I had most of a pitcher of Sapporo to myself. and I was outside. I was happy."}
{"text":"Solid and affordable 3*** option if you are in the Annex. Have been here a few times and it strikes me as a popular student option for lunch, though the crowd is usually a mixed bag. There are student specials if I recall correctly so bring your ID. 

Personally, I'd stick to the cabbage rolls, schnitzel and perogies. My friend had the smoked salmon and it looked and tasted pretty (below) average. If you have a sweet tooth, there are many cake and cookie options here, although they seem a bit pricey to me. $1.60 for a medium coffee is decent but $2.60 for a stale, day-old oatmeal raisin cookie is not cool.

Also... all-you-can-eat Perogies Wed 5-9pm. The Pole in me is telling me I have to make this happen sooner rather than later!!"}
{"text":"This place is so subpar, but there are people who genuinely like it. Why? I don't get it.

Yes, it's cheap, but there are places that are just as cheap and much better."}
{"text":"We came here as a group of 6 - and the place had plenty of seating, so it is a good place to go to if your in a larger group and they were open late which was also great. We each got a slice of cake and the cakes were pretty good and there are lots of cakes and cheesecakes to choose from. The Truffle and chocolate raspberry cake was everyone's favourite."}
{"text":"I've come here for brunch a number of times and it always a good experience. Seating is comfortable and the atmosphere is very laid back and relaxing. They have beautiful-looking cakes, which I will come back to try. The brunch is quite good and they are very fast too. Coffee is self-serve too, so you can refill as you need! I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Well I've been here a few times over the last couple of years, and it's always crowded. I guess it's kinda cool because it's in a great location. So, how could you go wrong, right? :)

I've never had a real meal here before, so I can't say anything about their food. But the desserts are just average. I've had much better cake before. Still. The vibe is cool, and the people watching is fun. I'll likely come back here again, because beer and desserts are always a good choice."}
{"text":"The best place to go! Wonderful people,decor,coffee.. The one on the Queensway is great start too!!"}
{"text":"The staff are friendly and I like the atmosphere (mainly for students, you'll see tons of textbooks and laptops). The food was decent (I had the jalapeno perogies with fruit salad and mashed potatoes for $11.50). The service is pretty quick (when I was there they did seem a bit understaffed as only one seat was open and many people were ordering food, however the staff did not seem to let this show.
The drinks are also cheap (a 60oz pitcher of sangria for just under $20, doubles are about $6.50) and with a double gin and tonic and the perogies my meal was about $18 with tax, so no complaints.
I haven't tried the desserts but on another evening (perhaps not during dinner/just after dinner) I would like to go back as they look amazing."}
{"text":"I've been going to Futures (yikes) for something like 25 years.   Started when I was just out of uni, needed a homey kind of place to have beer and mashed potatoes, visit with friends, have some cake.  Found it.

It's still a great place to order something (I love that I can have mashed while one friend is having cake, another is having soup, and still another is having beer and toast), relax and talk with friends.   

It's pretty dang casual, though sometimes you can see some fairly important politico types huddled over some paperwork (in their civvies, not suits).  

The mashed potatoes are still fantastic, the patio is a great place to have a beer whether you're 20 or 60+, breakfasts really are quite good (a friend from Philadelphia always has to go there for pancakes on every visit).  

Nothing wrong with the place except for the bathroom, and I don't think there's a good resto restroom within blocks."}
{"text":"Future's is one of my fave spots in Toronto, especially when I was in university. I've been there countless times and have never been disappointed. Patio season is the best to go! I've had items from the all day breakfast (great!), a few cakes (Caramel Crunch is my fave) and my fave meal: the chicken parmesan sandwich. The food is very reasonably priced and they are not cheap with their sides which I appreciated.

Two tips: parking on a weekend night is not the easiest to find in the area. And I believe it's cash only (but they do have a bank machine on-site). Also, it can be quite crowded inside when it's not patio season, but still well worth it. A great spot!"}
{"text":"Come for the cake or the student breakfast special (only because it is cheap, not because it is anything special) but I don't recommend venturing too far into their other offerings. The food is so-so.. absolutely nothing special. The pastries can be dry. But if you want a slice of cake you can't do better!"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm officially declaring this place overrated. I was here a couple of weeks ago and it was such a mission to hunt down a table as most vacated ones had dirty cups and trays strewn about. I don't think this place has actual waiters as you just pick up your food at a counter but they should deal with this pseudo garbage issue. 
I wanted to try one of Futures' much hyped about cheesecakes this time but didn't get a chance to. Here's what went down: I saw an unlabeled oreo cake behind the row of cheesecakes and could not tell if it was a sponge or cheesecake so I asked the server behind the counter, specifically pointing to the aforementioned cake. She said it was a cheesecake so I paid for it and when I got to my table and took the first bite, I could tell it was a plain, stale and extremely sweet sponge cake. I was extremely disappointed and I don't care how good the cheesecakes will potentially taste, I've given up. I guess this is fate telling me that everything about this place is just \"meh\" and that I will be just setting myself up for disappointment in a future visit (no pun intended!)"}
{"text":"Decent spot. Quick and simple service. Great location. I feel like everyone in Toronto should go to this place at least once. 

Almost a rite of passage"}
{"text":"My go-to place for brunch and dessert! It has a cafeteria feel and can get very crowded and crazy. Have a back up plan!

Food-wise: It's inexpensive, especially for breakfast. All you can eat perogies are a good time. Portion sizes for everything are massive. The coffee is good, as well, and there's a selection.

Bakery-wise: The gluten-free baked goods are over-priced and gross. The cakes are a little pricey but many friends swear by them. 

I always get great service. They're very quick at clearing tables and are friendly behind the counter. And they're licensed!"}
{"text":"One of my go to drinking places. Love this place.  

This place is pretty much self served. You order at the counters and wait for it. Then you can sit anywhere you want. 

I come here with my friends to get the sangria. They have the best sangria in town. Well in my opinion. I love it. I always get the red wine sangria but the white wine sangria is ok too. Sometimes we get a pitcher of beer too. Sometimes they have specials. 

They also have a side for cakes, coffee and tea. They have a wide selection of cakes and they are delicious. 

Alcohol and cake who would love that. They also have food too if you get hungry. The foods pretty tasty as well. 

Price wise, relatively cheap."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their chocolate mouse cake was delicious as well as their strawberry cheesecake. I can't stop thinking of all the wonderful cakes and pastries. I can't wait to go back and try their breakfast. Great area, great cafe to grab a cup of coffee and delicious dessert. They also have a nice patio for some beers and a snack. Like I said, I can't wait to back!! Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Bailey's cheese cake was ok....coffee was cold....good for conversation over a late night beer or coffee..."}
{"text":"Great cake. Nice selection of warm drinks (teas, coffees, apples cider, steamed milk with flavours, etc.). Sometimes a bit too loud for conversations when packed with students, but good for studying if you like a lively kind of white noise around you to help you stay on it. I wish they took debit though!"}
{"text":"They have cakes and cider and Amsterdam brew house beers (y) mmmmmm.

Cake + beer mmmmm."}
{"text":"I went for dessert and ordered a slice from one of the many Dufflet cakes. I opted for the simple \"chocolate cake\". I am not that impressed with Dufflet in general and this cake wasn't anything amazing either. The fudge icing would have to be the highlight but I made the mistake of not leaving enough cake for the proper cake to icing ratio. The icing ended up being too sweet (I have a high sweetness threshold) and I couldn't finish. I should have stuck with my preferred banana chocolate cake - everyone should run out and try this if they get the chance. Anyway, the cake slice, while a generous portion, is at the cost of $6.oo a slice! 

Bottom  line:I think this place is best for those just looking for a quick, easy bite."}
{"text":"Déjà vu... 3 years later and I remember why I wasn't impressed on my first visit. Had breakfast this month with my Niece because no other eateries in my area were open early on Sundays. Walk up to the counter and ordered our sausages and 2 eggs with hash browns. We both ordered a beverage with the breakfast. We had to go to another counter to get a mug and prepare our own tea and coffees like in a cafeteria but in a restaurant atmosphere. We tried to have a conversation while a group of 5 adults with a crying baby had a loud repartee. 25 minutes later breakfast was ready for pickup at the counter. Basically 1 sausage -cut in two (not kidding) and 2 eggs and buttered toast with fries. I only finished the sausage and eggs as the fries were less than edible. 

A big disappointment for over $22. I'm never returning to this place again -unless I have a memory laps in 3-6 years."}
{"text":"The fact that Future Bakery is always packed is a testament to how awesome it is. With large assortments of everything from fruit pies to chocolate cakes to cheese cakes and dessert bars to choose from, it's pretty much impossible to not find something you like.

That is, unless, you don't have a sweet tooth. In that case, you're in the wrong line (as there is almost always guaranteed to be one), but fear not, there is still something in store at Future for you. The sometimes overlooked kitchen at the back serves delicious home style food in satisfying portions. I'm a fan of the perogies and lasagna, but pretty much everything on the menu sounds and looks tasty. If you're in the mood for libations, Future even serves beer by the pint and wines by the glass, half litre, and litre. 

Regardless of what it is you're in the mood for though, make sure at least one person in your party is designated to snatch a table. The turn over is quick and pouting doesn't make circling for a table or standing with a plate of food any less frustrating."}
{"text":"A Caféteria like sweet/bakery café and bar with nice restaurant. So what a weird concept that worrks really well together Why? My friends don't drink, they don't like to go out in bar. Which kind of slows the alcohol going in my body. Ok but I want to drink some local beer. So far, make some good discovery, good product!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy mediocre half-assed cooking then this is the place for you! 

Tonight's dish was:

Burnt dry Schnitzel 
Tasteless, flavourless chickpea salad
Lumpy, cold mashed potatoes.

The cutlery was dirty - a perfect pairing for the dumpy atmosphere. The wait staff doesn't care about much of anything and I'm generally confused why this place was so crowded. The food is overpriced and disappointing. 

Very underwhelming. 

Booo."}
{"text":"Future Bistro is the perfect location for solo eaters. I came here alone to get work done and at least half the other customers were doing the same! Internet was fast, but it signed me out every 10 minutes when I was streaming. 

As for the food, I definitely had higher expectations because people on Yelp were raving about it. I ordered the jalapeño cheese pierogies which were spicier than anticipated. I also didn't realize they'd be boiled. It wasn't a horrible food experience, but it was very, very average. Maybe the desserts are tastier?

If I eat by myself in the area again, I will definitely come back... BUT DEFINITELY NOT THE PIEROGIES"}
{"text":"No frills, feel good place. The tables are sticky sometimes. Music can be loud. But crowd and servers are great. I go to this place to relax and eat, not dine, eat. 

Coffe refill is $1. Dessert is just plain awesome. Did I say awesome? 

You'll find university students on budget. That makes this place especial - brings back old memories. 

Hurray to sticky tables."}
{"text":"Ahh, Futures, a real jack-of-all-trades (coffee shop, bakery, cheap breakfast, cafeteria style lunch/dinner food, patio bar) establishment.

I lived a couple floors above this place for 3 years so I was a frequent visitor. 

Here's my summary:

PROs

- huge awesome fresh cake selection
- cheap, greasy breakfast
- big, lively patio. Great for summer days, people watching
- daily specials (all you can eat perogies on Wednesdays, for example)

CONs

- it's self service (cafeteria style line up) indoors. 2 Separate lines - one for hot food, one for coffee/desserts
- the service on the patio is terrible, good luck trying to get drunk or settle your bill
- the bathrooms are disgusting (but then again, Annex bathrooms are all pretty ghetto, for the most part)

Great little place if you're in the neighbourhood. But if you're NOT in the neighbourhood, it's not really worth a trip.

My fav meals - the breakfast special, the apple pancakes, perogies are ok, cabbage rolls are decent too!"}
{"text":"Future has changed quite a lot over the years. As far as I understand, this is the same Future Bakery that used to have an amazing bakery  at Runnymede and Bloor years ago. I used to absolutely love the Runnymede location for bread and sweets, and have some very fond childhood memories of the corner cafe.
Unfortunately, the Annex Future does not deal with too much dough in the literally sense, but they do make up for it with some 20-30 varieties of cakes available at most times. This, and the fact that you can be underage and hang out late at a cool spot, make Future a great spot in the Annex. The other positive quality is the huge patio and reasonably priced beer which could be very appealing in the summer. Add in quality service from a friendly staff, and you have a 4.5* experience for this part of the business.
What brings them down for me is their not-completely-successful venture into foods and drinks... 
Beer availability in afternoon is very variable, and chances are they will already be 'out' of some favourites. Additionally, the food is at best mediocre. If you are really hungry the schnitzel is a decent choice, but the sides that come with the meal will probably not impress.
Another factor that bothered me was the w/c which was more or less horribly disgusting early in the evening! Definitely something to improve on.
Minus this last point, it is understandable that this is meant to be a dessert place, and so overall Future is an A-OK place."}
{"text":"i love it!! so many good and creamy cakes (not for diet, for sure)!! very good and affordable brunch plates and combo, very nice and fun staff."}
{"text":"Went there today for breakfast at 8am. It's nice to actually find a place that's open, running, and settled at that time in the morning- I find the breakfast selection earlier than 11:00 in Toronto pretty weak at times. 

I went to Future after reading some Yelp reviews, and finding myself uncharacteristically hungry on my way to Home Hardware. 

Other yelpers are right, breakfast is relatively cheap, quick, and not bad. I have to say, my poached eggs were cold (I watched the waitress behind the counter take 3 orders while my eggs sat there on the counter) and they were poached a little hard for my liking. Good selection of drip coffees, and the patio was REALLY nice to do the crossword and people watch on/at. The homefries were delish. 

All in all, I will likely go back when I'm up early, and I'm pretty interested in coming back for all you can eat perogie night."}
{"text":"If I ever make a map of Easily Accessible Gross Bathrooms, Future would be #1. I'd give them 4 stars for their easy breakfasts, the dark and cozy cafeteria vibe, and their excellent, excellent looking lardycakes. But they've started saying \"it's that girl again\" every time I beeline from the door to the basement, and that makes me uncomfortable. There are surprisingly few bathrooms between Bathurst and Spadina on Bloor, and every alley has two fifteen years old Doing Something in it."}
{"text":"Popular destination among students and the artsy crowd. It boasts quite a large yet consistently packed patio almost every night in the summer. The bar food options are lacking (worst nachos ever!), however they have a decent enough menu for students to live off. I personally like their perogies and beef stew. They also have quite the delightful dessert menu for folks with the sweet tooth."}
{"text":"I am no expert in the authentic versions of the food served at Future's, but it doesn't really surprise me to hear that it might not be up to snuff.

Regardless, this a great place if you are looking for a full and lively dining room, and a really comfy (especially if you can get a couch) and relaxed atmosphere that will let you hang out from lunch, to dinner to dessert to coffee to drinks, doing or pretending to do or not doing homework the whole time. Uh, I mean, if you wanted to do that.

Yes, I went to U of T, and though I engaged in very little predictable, my-university-specific-behaviour, when it comes to Future's, I do exactly what \"they\" tell me to (\"they\" being whoever make the rules, probably the same people who told my sister and her Ryerson friends to go to the Salad King. Urban Planners, maybe?).

I personally find the food to be pretty tasty and most importantly (when you're trying to read an entire novel in one sitting on their patio) really filling. I often get the chicken parmigiana sandwich, and sometimes can't finish it(!) along with the TWO sides, usually featuring the mashed potatoes and gravy, which I kind of love. I am known for not liking gravy, under most circumstances. 

The desserts- well, anything but the cakes can be a little hit-and-miss. I was dissatisfied recently with a lemon square I bought and then couldn't really eat ('twas a little stale, and too chewy, in a bad way). The cakes are pretty good, though I am pretty fussy with my desserts. I'm sorry to say, but I prefer Dufflet's. But I can't sit with 8 of my friends til 1 am  over there, now can I?"}
{"text":"I have been holding out on reviewing this place because frankly I don't get what all the hoopla is about. When you live in the west end the Annex often becomes middle meeting ground for everyone and somehow this place is always regarded as neutral territory. I am sure if i lived around here I would cut this place a bit more slack (in the form of an additional star) but that's it.. this is not a place I ever see myself recommending to others for food or drink.

Their most redeeming qualities are great desserts and a nice patio... so in the winter this place is nothing more than a cafeteria-style cake bar! Taylor O.'s comment about the Sangria bering terrible was right on par. There was an odd radioactive look and taste to the mixture which made me think their sangria was bought readymade and poured over ice.

I will say that this place is cheap and certainly student friendly but I have yet to be wowed about anything in particular from here."}
{"text":"I like to come here to study sometimes and order a nice tall glass of ice and a bottle of coke. Here's the break down:

The food: really bad. I've eaten here a few times and the food runs on a scale of really bad to mediocre. I made the mistake of ordering poached eggs and they served them in the plate without draining them and my plate was covered in water. Ew. The mashed potatoes and gravy are edible. The desserts are nice and the coffee drinkable. 

The service. No table service, (might be on the patio not sure) it's all cafeteria style. The guys and gals at the counter are ok, not overly friendly. 

The space: big open concept with couches at the back. Good place for kids as the place isn't cramped so they won't be bored silly having to sit still. The patio is also really large and a great spot on bloor.

The result: don't expect much from the food but come for the great space and maybe a dessert."}
{"text":"There was only one person ahead of us in line and yet the service was very slow.  The cake is pre-cut in thin slivers and overpriced. It was the worst cheesecake I have ever tasted and this is supposed to be a dessert specialty café. I would never go back here."}
{"text":"The desserts here aren't so bad, I'm not sure if they're in-house though (can't remember) but they're a bit expensive. The patio is big but the service can use some work. They like to separate the patio patrons and the indoor patrons."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm not as attached to this place because I went to Ryerson. I have many more fond memories at Salad King than I do at this place, and it hasn't really impressed me over the years.

Yes to their cakes and cookies, coffee and hot chocolate.

Yes to their patio, no to their interior which kinda grosses me out.

Yes to the Eggs Benedict, no to the awful homefries that were overly doused in paprika without going near any other spice or flavour.

No to their orange juice that I saw them pour from Tropicana cartons.

And no to the washrooms, where I once found someone's dirty shoes stashed at the edge of the toilet.

But odds are, I'll be back if I'm in the area, if it's just for another delicious hot chocolate."}
{"text":"Man that breakfast was terrible. first time i was here i got the bfast sausages.. not good, so i decided the second time i was here to get bacon instead. how do you mess up bacon? will i be back? yeah probably.. its down the street from me and relatively cheap. who wants to cook when you're hungover??!"}
{"text":"Great all-around café. Warm, student-friendly atmosphere invites you to stay a while. East-facing patio is great a great place for a beer (or two or three) in the summer. Cakes are top notch also; they sell out quickly so grab your favourite slice early in the day.

Obligatory Title Pun: The FUTURE is now!

Menu Readability: Awkwardly placed above counter, but readable.

Need to mention: I've had three first dates at this place and no dice.

What this place teaches me about myself: It's not you, it's me."}
{"text":"I love Future's, because it serves oh so many purposes. Their breakfast is pretty generous and if you take your student card it's something ridiculous like fifty percent off. You can drink, you can eat insane amounts of perogies, you can get a coffee, you can rock the patio. Most importantly though....you can get CAKE. Like insanely good cake of all different kinds and pieces so big you'll want to finish them so badly but just won't be able to. Yeah....I mean it's pretty hard to go to Futures without being tempted by everything on display behind the counter.

I've spent plenty of nights here just talking with friends for hours, so I've got some pretty fond memories. It's a great place to grab a coffee, chill out, and not be rushed or anything. Also good if you want to bring a book and sit by yourself. Only one qualm, which I think somebody also mentioned too. They use cheap, store bought orange juice (which is totally fine...) except they make it look like it's fresh squeezed by pouring it into separate containers and putting it in a little fridge. I was tricked! 

So, if that's my only bad thing to say, then  Future's has pretty much got it going on ."}
{"text":"Easy, relaxing spot to catch up with a friend. Usually, it's an eclectic mix of people from the annex looking to unwind. Service and food is decent. Perogies are good and so are their sweet potato fries, which is hard to mess up. I personally enjoy their selection of cakes though--never been disappointed. This place is comfortable and familiar. I just wish they would invest in WiFi."}
{"text":"Future Bakery is a pretty cool spot for a casual night on the town.  If you like cheesecake, you need to check this place out. The raspberry mango cheesecake is my fave.  With so many other flavours, you'll definitely find one to suit your tastes!   I have always found the service to be quick and polite, and this place has a really great patio in the summer.   Next time, Carrot Cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Ask any of my friends what my most common complaint about Toronto is and they'll say \"Kat's always whining about how she can never find anywhere that's NOT a bar to hang out at after hours, and that all the good cafes close at the absurd hour of 7pm.\" And also \"There aren't enough hot, left-handed, blond-eyebrowed Aquarian men in this city.\"

Seriously, I'm always looking for places to wile away the evening hours, a place that's the equivalent of Rockaberry or Kilo in Montreal, who both specialize in dessert-y things and hot beverages. It's the Eastern European in me surfacing (we love our post-dinner dessert/coffee time).

Future Bakery fits the bill. Although I dearly miss the Bloor West Village location (it's since been replaced by a mediocre restaurant called Sharkey's that never lived up to the popularity of Futures), it's been closed for about 10 years now so I should reallllly build a bridge and get over it. 

The cakes at Future Bakery are ooh la la and more. Each cake is nearly a foot in height and looks almost too decadent to eat. It's really, really hard to decide which cake to buy (you can buy by the slice for about $5, or a whole cake for $40). So my suggestion is to just go back every day until you've tried 'em all, which is sort of what I've been doing this past week. I've had the Dulce De Leche Cheesecake, the Oreo Cheesecake, the Truffle Cheesecake and the Chocolate & Banana Cake. Holy pupshit. Incredible. The chai latte isn't bad, either.

This is a great place to hang out after a show, on a date, while studying (might need headphones though, it gets a bit noisy) or to generally hang out over coffee in a fun environment. Their patio seems to have been shut down this summer. I'm not too sure what happened but there's a petition going around to re-open it.

It's cash or credit only -- no debit.

SIDENOTE: I know the name of this place is \"Future\", but does that mean their website has to follow suit? When you visit the site you're redirected to a subfolder called \"future\" that says \"Coming Soon\". It reminds me of the halcyon days of animated \"Under Construction\" gifs that never, ever turned into anything, where \"Coming Soon\" equalled \"Coming Never.\""}
{"text":"This place always has such a great vibe with great coffee and cakes. I would definitely want to be taken here for a dessert date!! I've also been here for brunch and it's pretty good- my favourites are their nutella crepes and eggs florentine (which come with the best home fries ever)!!"}
{"text":"One of the only place open early, the breakfast what's cheap and bomb, I just got the simple 3 eggs scramble, white toast, bacon and home fries. Everything was cooked right and the potatoes were very spicy how I like! Great early affordable breakfast"}
{"text":"I like the coffee and pastries... which are made off site and delivered fresh.

Beware of the kitchen-food as I saw a huge cockroach crawling on the display glass."}
{"text":"I'm so sorry but I compare future bakeries right bread. To Silverstein's Quivas and bagel world.. There is absolutely no competition for future bakery with the other bakeries that I have mentioned. First of all there's not enough salt and I have had this future bakery bread for three route weeks. No mold has formed. Bagel world kivas or silver stanch the bread would be all green. When Fred gets moldy very quickly that means there's food value in it I am thinking that future bakeries bread will last as long as a Twinkie. I do appreciate their effort into creating a right bread but it just does not cut it"}
{"text":"A great neighborhood bar. The decor isn't particularly inspired, but the bar staff is friendly to a fault, and the food is solid. I had the chicken schnitzel, which while unremarkable, still hit the spot. Tap selection is a bit sparse, but they have a decent variety of bottles beers. Home fries are delicious, and people at my table sparred over the last few. With your meal, you also get to make a salad choice: mixed greens, coleslaw or fruit salad. 

The best part of this place though, is the real sense of camaraderie that seems to exist between all the regulars - it's common to see random patrons approach your table, only to discover that they're friends with someone else in your party. Everyone neighborhood has/needs a place like this. 

Didn't get to try the desserts, but they look fantastic as well. Will probably come back here a few more times before summer's out."}
{"text":"really great place for desserts...the food is decent as well 
a lil bit expensive, but the quality is there
5/5!"}
{"text":"The food is ok - the usual pub fare.  Their cakes and other baked goods are absolutely delicious.  In the summer, their sangriaand beer pitchers are great on their huge patio."}
