{"text":"Taste's omelet bar is a great deal.  $4 for a 4 topping omelet.  Can't stop eating these.  Going to check out the lunch seen soon."}
{"text":"I have to say that Taste has really stepped it up a notch since their renovation. Though I have been a faithful salad goer for years, the other foods available look and taste incredible.  If you get chance to try the jambalaya when it's offered, jump at it! You won't be disappointed! Wow! Great stuff! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I will NEVER patronize Taste Cafe again. I don't think I have ever been treated more rudely anywhere  than what I experienced this morning. I'll never spend another dime at Taste either personally or for business catering. Hope their shoulder shrugging 'who cares' attitude filled staff does well with no customers."}
{"text":"For folk working at the bank this is a quick and dirty lunch. I usually go with the salad whenever the lines are not long. The salad is not your average fare; it is something worth waiting the 15 minutes for!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Taste many times since my initial review, and I haven't really found many dishes that excite me. It's mostly the \"default\" place I go when I'm in my uptown office for lunch.

Today I tried the Grill area, and had a grilled chicken sandwich. It was a fine sandwich, and probably my favorite meal from Taste so far. I will echo what others have said here, the guy working the grill at Taste has a pretty bad attitude. It seems his default expression is a scowl. The look he gave someone when he couldn't hear what they were ordering, was quite rude.

If you can get over his attitude, he does make a fine sandwich. Even if he clearly doesn't make it with \"love\"."}
{"text":"Perfectly adequate but highly inconsistent lunch.  Nice location at BoA and have a fantastic outdoor patio upstairs that is never crowded.

I came in getting the \"Global Cafe\" which is occasionally good.  The burgers aren't bad but are pre-cooked and just re-heated when you order.  

I switched to the sandwich station which has the delicious TMB sandwiches.  That is pulled chicken, mozzarella, tomato, pesto and mixed greens.  Very good, but the sandwiches are pre-made.  Occasionally you will get a toasted TMB that was fresh out of the fridge [where pre-made sandwiches go] with a nice toasted outside and a cold inside.

That is disappointing but you may also come across a small chicken bone, which is even more disappointing in the middle of a frustratingly cold sandwich.  More often than not, the sandwich is very good [with Texas Pete] but like most of their food, suffers from serious inconsistency.

As a sum-up, one of my co-workers got a wrap that was one of the best things they ever ate.  They then purchased the same item throughout the week only to be disappointed every other time.  By no rhyme or reason, the same item may go from great to terrible in only a day."}
{"text":"This place is like a nicer version of a cafeteria with a grill line, sandwich line, pizza/flatbread line, and salad line. They also have soups, breads, snacks, and bottled drinks.

Been here multiple times for both breakfast and lunch and everything has been just ok. Nothing amazing but gets the job done for something fairly quick. I would have to say that breakfasts are a bit tastier than lunches....though I think it might have something to do with the ease of making breakfast! They do have a make your own omelette station, which is awesome!

Today I had a salad. They usually have different types of meat options available that change out every week (some kind of fish, chicken, pork, and tofu). They have a decent amount of toppings as well! So for like $9 or so, you come out with a pretty decent salad. I love their cilantro lime dressing!

I always feel like the staff is very rude. I just got snapped at today for no reason whatsoever. Just chalk it up to them being students, I guess. Regardless, decent spot for a quick meal to go."}
{"text":"I tried Taste for breakfast today.  I love their clean, modern look ,that J&W students prepare the grub for you and that there is a Sprouts-esque place there but I still miss Sprouts. Taste has an omelet bar which also doubles as a breakfast sandwich station and they also offer an omelet of the day or you can create your own. They get brownie points in my book for offering egg white omelets and have a nice selection of add ins. Omelet was good but didn't seem to gel too well together so I think I will stick to making my own at home. While waiting for my omelet, I looked at the prices of their sandwiches and it seemed a little more than I would like to spend for lunch so think this will be a breakfast only place for me when I want a sandwich. Unfortunately since it was right before the holiday and breakfast time, I didn't get the entire Taste experience.

The cashier seemed too involved with her conversation with a random and just sucked her teeth when she told me the price so that turned me off a bit. When you're at work, act professional and do your job, even if you're a college student (younger me is shaking her head at current me for saying this). I did see a sign while walking out that they offer cupcakes now, must check those out!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken sandwich it was SO bland, fries were barely warm. My coworkers said they tried the soup and its good, maybe I'll give it a shot later on, but having so much around to chose from it might take a while."}
{"text":"Located in Founder's Hall on the 3rd Floor. Just opened on Feb. 1st. It's being run by Compass Group and I think the pastry chefs are Johnson and Wales students.

Taste is like a high-end cafeteria. You walk in a pick a line - Pan Asian Bar, Cultural Exhibition (Pasta) Bar, Flatbread Bar, Make Your Own Salad, Dessert Bar. Then there are cooler walls of drinks and chip stands. And also \"Quick Pick\" pre-made sandwiches and salads. There is also a Barista with baked goods and coffee, teas, etc. I believe they also serve breakfast, but I have yet to be there at that time of day.. 

I visited the Pasta Bar. It was very good. I had a choice of penne or spinach gnocchi, chicken, sausage or shrimp, with an array of \"add-ins\" - spinach, sun dried tomatoes, onion, peppers, garlic, zucchini, etc. Then alfredo, pesto or marinara. 

I did penne, chicken, spinach, sun dried tomatoes, zucchini, garlic, and 1/2 alfredo, 1/2 marinara. 

The banana bread pudding - OUT OF THIS WORLD. Thought about it for days afterward.. 

And they had a sample of the tomato/mozzarella flatbread at the door.. MMMMMMMMM!!!!

There is seating near the checkout area and then outside of the doors overlooking Founder's Hall.

The food is quick, very good and I thought incredibly reasonable. It's a great spot for lunch in Uptown. I would definitely recommend a visit."}
{"text":"As others have said ... it's run by J & W students. I think they do a great job! Usually very friendly. The breakfast options are awesome ... an omelette with any fillings you could want ... a breakfast sandwich with the any toppings. Endless options (breakfast wise).  

This is a great place to swing by for lunch. The line can get a little long as most of the food is cooked fresh as you order. Or, you can help yourself to their delicious salad bar. The daily grill item is always a good choice ... their turkey burgers are huge and delicious. I also love that they have different bread options for your burgers/sandwiches. GREAT PRICES! If you get a daily special ... I think it's around $7.99 for sandwich, side and drink!"}
{"text":"Taste is a great week day lunch option. It is run by J&W students. It's cafeteria style but items are served to you. They have different menu items on a regular basis. The entrees I have had were eh. When I go, I go for the salad bar. The offer such a wide selection of proteins, greens, vegetables, dressings, cheeses, and toppings. If you like salad, there is definitely enough for you to make a salad you would enjoy. The line can get really long so try to get in a little before noon if possible."}
{"text":"I sent the following feed back to both Jeffrey Wingate and Thomas Smead at the Compass group. They were both non-responsive...

Every morning for about the past 2.5 yrs, I have purchased breakfast here. Overall, everyone is nice, helpful and courteous. The place is always clean and orderly and the food presentation is very pleasing. Over time, the staff there has changed quite a bit.  There has also been changes in the flow of how orders are taken and prepared. This has helped tremendously in getting in and out more efficiently. I have always raved to colleagues about Taste to the point that my team purchased me a $50 gift card as a gift. For the most part, I have been very pleased with the service.

There is a worker named Hector that assists with the sandwich prep every morning. He has done so for the whole time I have patronized the establishment. From what I have observed, his primary job is to work the sandwich station and to help with any overflow of customers. Initially, it was his job to take the orders of those wanting hot cereals in the morning.  This has now moved to a self serve station. From the beginning, I CONSISTENTLY greeted him each morning with a please and thank you. He never once replied, smiled or returned the gesture.

Early on, I began to notice how he would take his time to assist me. I would approach and he would continue prepping to only stop once another person walked up behind me.  I mentioned this to the current manager sometime back and there was never any real change in his demeanor.  I STILL continued with the same \"Can I please have a small oatmeal, thank you\" day, after day.

Recently, I have come in and his job is to now assist the ala carte customers ( I assume) since I have seen him help many others.  This week and last whenever I walk up, I have waited upwards to 8 minutes in line before someone assists me, only to be ignored by him.  I can tell by the cooks frustration that he should be helping him out. But after today, I have had enough. Two years is really too long... He is rude (to me) and doesn't really appear to like his job. As a  regular customer in this establishment, I am not feeling valued. I am thinking that maybe the managers communication with him was either not effective or ignored. Either way, if this continues, I will no longer make purchases here. This may not matter in the scheme of things, but I did feel the need to voice my opinion."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to get a quick lunch uptown.  The salads are made to order with your choice of greens, protein (including tofu), toppings and dressing.  The price is no higher than the places with the pre-made salads on a shelf but the variety, quantity and quality are far superior.  The salad bar almost always has a line, so you know it's good!  They also have soups, sandwiches, burgers, and a hot plate special.  There are several different stations with a variety of offerings which rotate out specials daily.  In addition they have baked treats and a coffee bar.  A friend I sent over there for a salad bemoaned all the money he has wasted elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love Taste! It's like my official weekday breakfast spot. I mean where else in uptown can you have a made to order egg white omelet with spinach, mushrooms, tomato's, turkey sausage and Parmesan cheese.....cooked in olive oil?? Absolutely nowhere else folks! Yesiree, this is my spot! My only wish would be that they offer salsa as a condiment because I'm tired of having to walk over to Salsarita's to complete my omelet experience:-) They also offer the real deal steel cut oatmeal with your choice of fruit, walnuts, raisins, cranberries, granola, or brown sugar.......talk about cholesterol friendly........man please!  In my honest opinion, for breakfast it just doesn't get any better than this. Yes, I miss Spratt's dearly, but I have a huge crush on Taste right about now. I won't comment on lunch because I've had hit or miss experiences as it changes often. My review would not be complete without recommending the cupcake area for those stressful days....my favorite is the red velvet with a whipped topping.........to die for!  5 stars for breakfast without a doubt!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken tortilla soup ...there was not even a piece of chicken in the $4 cup of soup.  Not worth it.  Coworker had 1/2 turkey sandwhich which I tasted a piece and the bread was dry.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"This place has a very clean and modern feel to it.  I ordered the Caprese sandwich and it was very good, washed it down with a bottle of water.  I ate there and that was fun for people watching.  I would like to try this place again as I am mixed about my review but I can't put my finger on it..."}
{"text":"When Taste opened it was touted as something unusual & had a special relationship with Johnson & Wales. Originally they had a good varying around of unusual specials. Unfortunately it has become more of a routine spot. However, I do love the oatmeal bar for breakfast. There is regular oatmeal & a special option & toppings you put on yourself to get it just right. & oatmeal price is for this is actually cheaper than the instant paper cup oatmeal I had been making at work!"}
{"text":"Very nice looking place with great decor and good looking deserts.

The bad here hugely outweighs the good.... The dude who serves food was ANGRY (rawr) because I didnt know that the special came with rice. Again this dude got angry at the only customer in his place at 1:45 because I didnt know sides came with it. 

Stay away from this joke, who cares if its students they are clowns acting like children."}
{"text":"Somebody pointed us here for lunch.  We walked in and I was impressed by the looks of it-- clean, bright space (if slightly futuristic), variety of fresh-looking food.

In execution, it didn't really live up to appearances.  My corn-chili bisque didn't really taste like vegetables or spice; my turkey club sandwich had big chunks of dry tasteless turkey on big chunks of dry tasteless bread.  I nibbled at it and threw it away."}
{"text":"If you want to have a quick lunch with a fairly acceptable price, it is one of the store I will recommend. Their regular menu has only a few basic HK style options. However, they offer daily special, in term of lunch menu, which is nice if you work in the area and tired of the every other restaurant. Their daily special are usually posted on wechat moment. Sometime they even post short video of how things are made which somewhat make their food more \"special\".

However, in my case, I always don't have a chance to eat until 2-3. By that time, they usually have couple item sold out and ended up with few choices.
example, last time they had egg, which is quite commonly use in sandwich, sold out, so anything contain egg they are unable to offer."}
{"text":"Great food and staff however they are still challenged in having more people behind the grill during breakfast rush. Went in today to give them another chance. 10 people in line, one cook."}
{"text":"I've visited this place several times since moving to the 1BAC building next door.  Since the menu changes so frequently the experience can be really hit or miss.  It's a good idea to check the menu online beforehand, which lists out all the specials/salad toppers/soups etc. for each day that week.  This place is a great option for groups as each person will most likely find something he likes.  Although a bit pricey, the food is high quality and they offer half off pre-prepared foods around 4pm on Fridays.  If you're looking for a quick bite to eat, this is a pretty safe bet."}
{"text":"It has been a few years since I have been back at this place but now that I am working back on this side of Uptown, I went back for breakfast because they had good oatmeal at a good price and some decent toppings.
I am not sure how the rest of the place is because I haven't been back for lunch yet but breakfast was disspointing.
The oatmeal has been moved to self serve, which is perfectly fine. But it is not well monitored. The oatmeal consistency is now waaay to thick. So much so that it's a struggle to get it out of the laddle.
The first time I went, they were out of oatmeal lids so I myself had to rumage underneath the cabinet to find them because no one would come over and help and there were three other customers looking for lids. Today they did not have the larger oatmeal cups and said they were completely out.
I'm not sure if managment changed or if I caught them on back-to-back off days, but it doesn't make me want to rush to come back.
I used to love this place and there is a lot of potential so I hope they step it up."}
{"text":"Just went to Taste for lunch.  Well we will get this out of the way first:  the food is good and fresh.  Everything in there is shiny new and clean and sleek.  However, after getting the soup and sandwich combo with a drink, I am STILL HUNGRY.  And I paid over ten bucks!  The sandwich is a half in the combo - which means MINI, we are talking three bites.  Those three bites were good, however for $5.99 today at Jersey Mikes I would have had a huge sandwich AND chips AND a drink.  So - overall I think they should have toned down the chic-ness and tried to price their food better!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Have not eaten lunch here very much but the couple times I have it has been great. I normally eat breakfast here and we sometimes come 2 or 3 times a week to get it to go. The line can take a little longer than some places but they usually only have 2 people making the orders and they are made right in front of you. If you aren't a patient person don't bother coming it is worth the wait though if you do have to wait a little bit. 

I normally get a croissant with bacon, egg and cheese and its great. The breakfast wrap is amazing as well. The omelet is my favorite item though, you can get whatever you want in it and it is very nice and thick, very filling. The price is great also, I normally spend like 3-4 dollars on breakfast and it is much better than most places. I would definitely try this place out if you never have."}
{"text":"Sleek decor but a bit pricey.  I was very impressed with the food and for good reason, the people working behind the counter are Johnson and Wales students (some of them-not all).  I had a falafel sandwich and chips and can't say a bad thing about it, it was fantastic.  They have a wide selection of food to choose from as well.  You can get a turkey burger prepared immediately all the way to picking up a quick deli sandwich and make a quick getaway.  

The location makes it convenient for me so that's a plus being that it's in the building I sometimes work in.  I don't know that I would go out of my way to dine here though."}
{"text":"This is a great concept. I like variety, especially when one works downtown and eats there every day.  I tried Crispy Asian Chicken Wrap. It was prepared in front of my eyes, tasted fresh and had a reasonable price.

The place is very - Very clean, bordering on Hospital clean, albeit with more colors of the walls. Staff is very nice, prices are acceptable, and variety is great! Too bad it's in Charlotte, NC. Maybe we need a franchise in the Bay Area. Hmm."}
{"text":"Love their breakfast setup and their salad bar is quick and easy. I do. It like the refrigerator taste to ALL of their precooked meats that they add to salads. If I wanted day old cold protein I'd bring my lunch!! So far both the pork and chicken taste funky!! I also don't like having a To go salad tossed in all the dressing!! It's soggy by the time I eat it!"}
{"text":"Instead of a coffee and cake cafe, Taste Cafe is a mini Hong Kong cafe.  It features probably the simplest HK cafe menu possible: 4 types of rice dishes, 4 types of soup noodle, 6 types of sandwiches and 9 types of beverages.  There are 2 breakfast combos and 2 lunch combos.  In addition, there is a blackboard menu in store with a few more lunch noodle/rice/dumplings choices.  I appreciate this concise menu because I can decide what to eat very quickly.  While there are a few tables for dining in, the menu reflects that the cafe targets quick take out.

I ordered a sandwich with coffee breakfast combo.  The white bread (I was not offered choice of bread) was thick and soft, not your basic Wonderbread.  The meat was thin but okay.  The coffee was probably an instant coffee, but it had cream not milk, so it tasted quite good. In all, it was not a gourmet sandwich but a good basic, regular sandwich that you can make at home.  For what it is,  It is priced fairly at $4.50 for the whole combo.

I tried my best but could not find the opening hours posted anywhere.  The store owner may want to improve on this."}
{"text":"Good breakfast spot. They make fresh pancakes, biscuits, omelets, you name it! Demitrius - the cook in the morning gives you a warm welcome with a huge smile. Lunch is 'ah ok'. Long lines and mediocre food - def recommend breakfast!"}
{"text":"So, I've heard about this place from my team.  The key thing here folks keep bringing up about this place is it's run by or staffed by some Johnson & Wales students (cooking / hospitality school in Charlotte).
Located in the center of the city in Founder's Hall (Bank of America) on the 3rd Floor.  It is a bit tricky to find it if you haven't been in that building.

Design, layout, and décor is ultra modern and minimal.  They have several key food areas...food bars where you pick a baseline dish/pasta/sandwich/salad/item, then add onto it as you like based on the extras they have that particular day.  They also stock a good supply of side items.

I had the mixed greens salad with chicken and light dressing....and it was very good....even better than Dean and Deluca's....which is saying something!

FREEBIE ALERT:  They have free water in carry out cups...after you go through the cash register, so save a few bucks and pick it up instead.

The food was served quick, but the plastic container my salad came in was so tightly sealed I had to tear the plastic to get it off....needless to say had I not taken care to do so, it would have exploded all over the place.  

In addition, they have a sweets area that does a special on Tuesday where you get a free cup cake when you buy three.....not sure if that is a hit here, but in Chicago?!?!?!  Look out...they ladies would have loved it up there!

Pricing was in-line, if not a bit more expensive than Dean and Deluca which was disappointing.  Finding good, healthy, and cheap lunch alternatives in the center city continues to be a challenge for me.  At $8 to $9 a day...that adds up to over $2000 annually....ouch!

Finally, they'd gotten 5 stars, but they're trash set up wasn't done very well as they tried to provide several options as it pertains to recycling, but the wording on the cans and how close the landfill trash can and recyclable trash can are together it was just a jumbled mess of trash?????  Add in the armoured car like salad container and they lost one star :^(

But Taste is a winner in my book.  Tucked away as it is, it does serve up some good fresh food."}
{"text":"Its like a vogue version of a cafeteria. Salad counters/ Sandwich counters / burger counters etc etc. very clean, very appetizing, very convenient. 
Food options are decent , salads ,soups, burgers, sandwiches, bowls etc
And yes....they do make a damn good salad!
Would recommend- more for the convenience, cleanliness and quality rather than variety."}
{"text":"While the location is physically close, the pace of service means I can walk over a block and still return with my lunch before I even get to place my order here.  The portions are small and not even remotely standardized.  For example, you may end up with more dressing than leafy green in a salad or more leafy green than meat in a sandwich.  Also, I hate when the fruit salad ends up being all melon plus one or two grapes, not really a fruit salad in my book.  And, yes, as others have noted, I am pretty much hungry again within 10 minutes of eating.  

The staff is incredibly impatient and angry--even when they're the ones who are offering items not on the menu or have many menu items not available without indication (i.e., I ask for it and they exasperatedly tell me it isn't available as if they think every time they told a customer before they were talking to me).  They rarely suggest alternatives (oh, that option isn't available today but we have X weird thing that we did instead, would you like that?), and when they do, the cashiers have no idea how to price them.  

I only come here when work company dictates it and would never choose to patronize this location on my own."}
{"text":"Legit 3 stars in my opinion - wouldn't crave this place but also don't mind coming here once in a while..

Small, very friendly take-out style restaurant with a very simple menu.  Nothing you can't make at home. There kitchen is the same size as the one in a regular condo or home.

Take-out price for a rice noodle with 2 slices of luncheon meat and 1 egg was $6.50. Come out of the kitchen within 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Would like to give this more stars - usually I get either the salad bar or the \"international\" meal from the grill. The food is usually pretty good from the grill - salad is ok. The service/attitude of some of the staff could use some improvement though/ I see comments below echoing the grill cook's demeanor - I went there today and he was pretty rude. Other times I've gone and have been annoyed at the checkout situation, i.e. I'm standing in line on one side behind a person, and as soon as they're finished checking out, I'm told to go to the other side. Food is great, but service isn't always friendly or pleasant."}
{"text":"Convenience is king.  3rd time here now and I'm slowly coming around - you just gotta know what to get.  

This time I got the artisan sandwich - chicken TMB was deliciousness.  Not quite like my downtown LA spot, but pretty close. I highly recommend the TMB, but that should be pretty obv when you see the throng of people waiting for this particular sandwich.

dmo out."}
{"text":"Taste is a great place for breakfast and lunch. They have a rotating menu and action stations that keep things interesting. The staff is friendly and will answer any questions you may have. Because 90% of the items that they sell are made to order the lines can get long, but the food I worth the wait. The only issue that I've had here has been with ordering the same item and having two different chefs prepare it different ways. Regardless of if it was one egg or two on my sandwich, the meal still came out tasty!
I also have a big sweet tooth and love that they have cupcakes and other pastries available. Every Friday after 3 all of these sweet treats are half off!!!"}
{"text":"This place is okay. It's well known for being convenient, but I didn't find the long line at lunch hours to be that convenient. It could be because I usually stand and wait for the daily grill. Ready made sandwiches and salads did look like they were being distributed faster.

Last week, I got a grilled chicken BLT with ranch. It was good. It was messy, but it was good. And the price is right for a fresh food place in the middle of town. But every time I go, I feel like I have to wait extra longer than others and never find a table.

Well, it's taste-y."}
{"text":"Ugh. I so want to give this place 3 stars at least but I just don't think I can. I have come here for breakfast and/or lunch before and it has never really been a bad experience until today. Granted it was my fault for showing up today at 12, but hey...I was stuck at work!! 

I felt for the chef in training. He was alone manning the burger grill with 10 people in line....starving I'm sure. When it was my turn, I was trying to be as polite as possible. I could see his sheer terror and frustration all over his face. Taste should of have a helper at least. My turkey burger was good, but cold. :( I had to reheat it when I got back to work. Last time I got a turkey burger, they've been nice and hot. He ran out of sweet potato fries and again I could see the panic in his face when I asked for them. I simply took the reg fries (my hips will thank me later...) and went on my way. 

This place is hoppin' and poppin' come lunch time. Try to go at 11:30 or after the lunch crowd. Breakfast is yummy and it's less of a mass chaos of people. I think that if they had more helpers come rush hour, this would help!!!"}
{"text":"Everything here is good and fresh!  That can sometimes go a long way for people but for me... I was a little disappointed in the bang for my buck.  Personally, I think lunch is overated and bland.  Sandwiches and Salads galore though.  The problem was the inconsistancy.  I like coming back to a place that I know is going to be good. Additionally, the sandwiches here can hold a candle to the ones at 7th Street Public Market.  

The best part about Taste... The brekfast.  My man makes a mean, but small, omelete that really hits the spot.  I've heard the oatmeal is good, too.  Trust me, stick to breakfast though.

-Ian M."}
{"text":"I met three friends here who work in the buildings around the restaurant.  This was my first experience.  The line was a bit long, but if the food was worth it, then I didn't mind.  I chose a chicken sand which (number 1). It was good, but, the chicken is so finely ground it was very messy to eat. 

The taste was awesome, but I would have loved to see the menu of condiments prior to having the pressure of ordering with a long line behind me.  

The upstairs dining area has a great view!!  When the weather is nice, the patio is awesome as well.  I would recommend this place to anyone not in a big rush.  I also hear they are closing it down for a while to remodel.  

Happy eating!!"}
{"text":"Taste offers a large selection of items, from the salad bar, hot station - which changes daily, to the grill, and a soup and sandwich bar.  In addition to the fresh options there are a few select items for the grab-n-go.  Overall the options are plenty, but after giving it three visits, I can say everything is just ok.  Today I went with the soup and sandwich, a shrimp bisque soup and the chicken mozzarella and tomato sandwich. The soup was hot, but very rich and the sandwich was ok.  Very heay on the bread and the chicken could have been skipped."}
{"text":"I go here a lot of the time for lunch. If you work in Corporate Center, it is so convenient. The selection is pretty varied. You walk into an area that has multiple lines, for you to get different types of food. Grab your food, then there is seating on that floor, upstairs, and outside upstairs. They have several types of pre-pared sandwichs. They heat up, and add toppings. They usually have a hot lunch special. They have a grill for burgers, etc. They have a killer salad bar. They usually have another food bar, which will be themed Indian, or other such. And they have a soup bar. I normally eat lite for lunch and go for the soup, which is always tasty. Love the clam chowder when they have that. They also serve Starbucks coffee and usually have some nice looking cup cakes, though I've never tried them. In the mornings, they have a breakfast, bacon, eggs, etc,., or they will cook up a very good omelet or Egg sandwich. Also a quick place to get into and out of."}
