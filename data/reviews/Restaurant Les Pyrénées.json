{"text":"Went here with high hopes but was highly disappointed. Food was without any character and tasted mediocre. Good ambience and service but sub par food!!"}
{"text":"When we walked by, most other places were packed and this one didn't have many people eating there. So we were a bit leery, but decided to try it anyway because we liked what was on the menu. We were very pleased with the decision. The food was awesome, the service excellent and the prices were quite reasonable."}
{"text":"Very nice dinner for a first in Montreal. 
Tasty food and good wine.
Good service too."}
{"text":"Beware this restaurant is a tourist trap : the menu is beautifully written but the food is more than deceiving. They make constant mistakes. A very pretentious restaurant."}
{"text":"We walked to the Old Town and came across this quaint little restaurant and looks at the menu posted outside.  A waiter came out so we decided to give it a try.

Prix fixe was very reasonable.  I tried the liver and it was nicely done in a balsamic vinegar sauce.  I had a glass of Bourgogne Pinot Noir that was nice.  The dessert was a fancy plate with a desert wine soaked cake center.  Nicely done and great value."}
{"text":"I went here because Gibby's was too busy. It was a quiet, fine dining looking place. The service was fantastic. I ordered the 12hr braised lamb and I thought it was pretty good. My one complaint is the prices are high, but not too much different than the rest of Montreal. I would recommend this place if you can't get in one of the other places like Gibby's. We had a couple of desserts and neither were very good. We also had the tapas appetizer which weren't that great."}
{"text":"Visiting from Miami Florida and ate at this wonderful restaurant today We had the vegetable hamburger, the best I have ever tasted. I have lived in NYC , Los Angeles and Miami so this says a  lot about the food at Les Pyrenees. Too bad this is my last night in Montreal as we certainly  would re- visit this establishment. The service was also very good. This is s real winner, enjoy ."}
{"text":"We had a great time here and the food was great. Portions are small, and it was expensive, but I felt that we got our money's worth because of the beautiful and delicious food, and great service.

My daughter's allergic to milk, so I was afraid we'd have problems with misunderstandings and cross-contamination, but the waitress was really good and spent a lot of time helping us find dishes that she wouldn't be allergic to."}
{"text":"Delicious French/ Spanish food. Fish and pasta's great. The Alberta beef a bit off.  Great ambiance and location was easy to get to from Saint Antoine."}
{"text":"An extra star for their attentiveness to gluten allergy, and for their kindness in working through my halting French. Solid wine selection and recommendation by server. The ingredients had more potential than the execution. I was dining on my own and the main course arrived lukewarm on a hot plate. The cooking could be better, but it was a good, complete meal, in a pleasant, relaxing environment. A family was celebrating a birthday at the next table and the server added a sparkler to the birthday girl's dessert without being asked -- nice  touch."}
{"text":"Great everything! 
Excellent service, awesome food, tasty desserts and a quiet place away from the crowd. Risotto, Salmon, Zarzuela, Catalan Orange Cake, all great flavor, portions and nice presentations! Best meal in Montreal! No doubt a +5 Stars all the way!"}
{"text":"I've never been to a restaurant where so many things went wrong yet the quality and taste of the food made me not give a \"blank\". My goodness, it was the best meal I had in Montreal over the weekend hands down. The cod salad was amazing, the gazpacho (arrived 30 minutes late) was oh so good, and the braised lamb was worth the ridiculous 1 hour wait. The wait staff was warm and friendly and although dinner took probably 1 1/2 hours longer than it should have, that braised lamb was worth it! Please stop by and enjoy! Just make sure you have absolutely nothing to do afterwards or you'll be late! Lol"}
{"text":"Just stop for lunch I was walking thru St. Paul's, the vegetable soup was great, I ordered. Cod in a garlic and pepper sauce cooked beautifully, the service was excellent no delays at all and a smile in the face, totally recommend this spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Came here by accident during new year day.  Had a great time and enjoyed their food.  We shared a side salad with their Seafood Pella.  Great portion for two."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant during my business travel in Montreal this spring. Great Spanish, Catalan and French cuisine. Their cassoulet is probably the best in town, makes you feel like dining in Paris.

Their menu is a bit expensive at first sight but on the other hand their wine list is affordable (several good Rioja starting at 50$). A selection of private import wines."}
{"text":"We went in with high expectations given all the positive reviews, but left pretty underwhelmed. 

We started with the heart of palm and Brie salad, which was okay but there was a bit too much balsamic dressing. We were informed that only two vegetarian main courses were available, so we went with the Mille Feuille. Sadly we found it really really bland but didn't really have any choice as the burger and lasagna were not available when we went at noon.

The orange cake was pretty decent, but didn't make up for the rest.

Our friends who were non-vegetarian had a better experience, but we'd recommend that vegetarians stay away, or at least confirm what menu options are available before they grab a table."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. I loved the seafood pasta, it was cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! It may have been one of the best presented and tasting meals we have had in a long time"}
{"text":"Tres bon repas en table d hotes-
Soupe de potimarron delicieuse- nous avons teste le pave de boeuf ( super) , la blanquette de veau (tres bonne et parfum√©e) et le tartare de saumon (divin )
Au dessert : choux aux fraises et un coulis dz chocolat a tomber -
Super super super"}

Food 4 stars
Service 5 stars
Decor 5 stars"}
{"text":"This place was not too far from our hotel and when we walked by it was crowded.  We were able to get seats near the front.  I ordered leak and celery cream soup.  It had a nice subtle flavor.  My hubby had the mussels $24.95 and I had rabbit $28.95.  The rabbit was very tender and tasty.  Dessert was a chocolate macaroon $10.25, which was about 6 inches wide and quite good.  Total bill with expresso, no wine, came to $67 without taxes.  We had an enjoyable meal, the wait staff was  attentive and service was good."}
{"text":"We were lured in by the waiter, who came out while we perused the posted menu.  It was a slow mid-winter's day.  But we're glad we did!  The service was very sweet and attentive.  The tables with white table clothes, and a comfortable formal/comfortable ambiance.  We ordered their veggie burger, and the penne with veggies, which were both delicious and plentiful.  Not too pricey.  We would go back."}
{"text":"Tourist trap! Don't be fooled like I was!

If you have a lot of money and don't know what to do with it, why don't you just give it to me? I'll make you something! I swear it will be more delicious than what you eat here, and I've never even been to chef school. 

Notable: Place has nice bathrooms with nice-smelling mango hand lotion. Maybe stop in to pee on your way through Old Montreal? 

Unfortunately, that was the only notable thing about this place, other than the way-too-high prices. Oh, we also liked the free baguette w/ olive oil way better than our entrees. Shared some of the house red with my partner, which was fine. We came here because it was all that was open, we were sick of wandering around on a -30 day, and they had some veggie options on the menu.

I would put the food at maybe a 1.5 or 2, but combined with the exorbitant price, it is definitely a 1. My partner had a pasta dish and also rated it as a 'meh', which was unfortunate since I think it was around $30, more expensive than mine. I got some kind of veggies put on top of each other like a leaning tower of pisa, and the smallest little lump of quinoa you ever did see. The side salad, also miniscule, was clearly made with the 'spring mix' you get from a box at the grocery store. It is smart to judge a place based on its salads - if the dish is more than $10, a box salad green mix is completely unacceptable IMO. The veggies - I would argue boring veg fare, as they are in like every single vegetarian dish made by people who do not understand how to do anything interesting with non-meat items - included zucchini, red pepper, and tomato, all of which were saturated in oil as to be almost tasteless. Sat way too heavy in my stomach, and way too little quinoa to help balance out the oil from the veg. Newsflash, just lopping excess oil on something does not make it 'gourmet.' 

Service was fine. I got leftovers in a take-away box but ended up throwing them out. (I NEVER DO THAT.) Couldn't bring myself to eat it. Too icky.

Probably the worst value for dollar I have gotten in a LONG time."}
{"text":"We had lunch special-steak, lamb shank, pork cheek, and the seafood pasta. Everyone is satisfied with the meal! Recommend this'"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner with my friends on Tuesday night. Food is good and customer service is great. Have read some reviews that complaint about price range. But i don' think it was expensive."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant in one of the best streets of the city. The service was also a 10, and the food superb, go for lunch because they have specials at great price. We had the cod and the sea bass and they were amazing..."}
{"text":"We were walking by this restaurant in Vieux Montreal and decided to eat here because the space seemed calm and inviting. We had dinner for two and enjoyed our meal. The staff was distracted but friendly and helpful. They let us taste the wine before deciding even though we were getting wine by the glass. We had salmon tartare which was tasty and came with a small side of cooked vegetables, a little decorative salad and a side dish of tasty French fries. We also had Catalan style vegetables in a vegetarian lasagna which was good but the tomato sauce was a little overwhelming. This also came with a side salad with a nice balsamic vinaigrette. Overall a very nice meal."}
{"text":"While we didn't have a reservation, we were warmly welcomed and seated at a lovely table.  Moreover, while, initially there were just two of us, our party grew to five and the restaurant amiably accommodated us.  The menu is Basque-Catalan and there was a very good selection.  I had a seafood pasta that was absolutely delicious with a very generous selection of shellfish.  The meals of all my fellow diners looked great too and the consensus was that the meals were excellent. All in all, the restaurant offered delicious food, wine, and excellent service. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Les Pyrenees."}
{"text":"Je suis surprise qu'il n'y ait aucun avis en fran√ßais sur Les Pyr√©n√©es!!! 
Je vais aux Pyr√©n√©es depuis des ann√©es et c'est toujours aussi excellent.
Service impeccable et tr√®s professionnel. 
Le menu est tr√®s diversifi√© et il y a quelque chose pour tout le monde! Tout est bon! Je recommande fortement certains items qui sont mes coups de coeur! Dans les entr√©es, la gaspacho est d√©licieuse, l'assiette de tapas √† la Catalane est superbe si vous voulez essayer une plus grande diversit√©.
Dans les plats principaux, les pennes au chorizo sont toujours merveilleux, la paella est incroyable et les mots m'√©chappent quand je pense √† l'agneau brais√© de douze heures. 
Les desserts sont aussi supers!
Bref, allez y et d√©couvrez cette petit perle rare dans le Vieux-port, prenez le temps de d√©guster un super repas."}
{"text":"Came for late lunch. Stumbled upon it completely by accident. Excellent unpretentious very fresh Spanish/French fusion Cousine. Extremely reasonable prices, fantastic service. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Marvelous find in this part of the old town.
Enjoy a large menu selection from Spain and France.All of this with a very nice service from the staff.
I sure will be back."}
{"text":"The entree was great (salad with heart of palm) and the dessert was amazing (orange cake with chocolate sauce)! However, I was not very happy with the main course- as a vegetarian, I chose this restaurant since it has four vegetarian main courses. Unfortunately, there were only 2 options available for lunch, including the lasagna that I wished to try. I ended up with the Mille feuille, which was a quite bland (layers of boiled eggplant mixed with layers of cooked onions and asparagus). On hindsight, I should have checked before we all sat at the table. My friends who were non-vegetarians had much better options and enjoyed their meals. Best to check available options before you eat if you are vegetarian or vegan."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful evening at Les Pyr√©n√©es! The staff were all very helpful and friendly.  The food was delicious - our favourite was the cod. Portions were generous. Also a very kid-friendly restaurant. They provided my toddler with a large colouring book and a big box of crayons. They took his order first and his food came very promptly. We would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"It is a good restaurant. However, it is little bit pricier for what it offers. We had the Cod filet and Past of the day. Cod was amazing. Pasta was ok."}
{"text":"Excellent food! It's a combination of french and spanish (Spain). The portions are quite large, especially for the pasta dishes. The veal pasta and the pasta with muscles were excellent (with white and rose wine respectively). The staff are friendly. Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We just passed by the restaurant and walked in when seeing the photo of paella served in this restaurant. 

Food is excellent and so is the service.
The wine waiter recommended went well with the course we ordered.

We ordered Chorizo and Shrimp Risotto and Paella, with 2 wine on top and the dessert of day, which is a almond and cherry cake.

Will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"We were recommended by our carriage driver loved it must try!!! Portions are small and a bit pricy but enjoyed it."}
{"text":"We had one of the best meals in years here. The restaurant is intimate and cozy. The staff are professional and provide top notch service. It was difficult to choose from the many tempting dishes on the menu. The pan crusted goat cheese with greens and strawberries was a perfect blend of crunchy, creamy, fresh and green and sweet. The vegetarian pasta was full of flavor with tender penne tossed with a sauce of tomatoes, red peppers, edamame, baby zucchini, mushrooms, garlic and more. The serving was 4 times what I could eat and I was starving.  The shrimp and chorizo risotto was divine!  So creamy and full of flavor, another large portion. The child's pasta with tomato sauce was wonderful as well. Fresh French bread, many wines (from a very nice wine list) by the glass, a perfect place for a wonderful meal.  Our only regret was not having room for dessert."}
{"text":"Cozy spot with a charming staff and creative, delicious dishes.   Wife and I shared a paella feast for our main.  Look at that picture!  It was loaded with so much top quality seafood, we could barely finish it.  Perfect balance of flavors.

One minor suggestion to the manager - while the background music is not loud, electronic beat music isn't the right genre for your ambiance."}
{"text":"Very good or pre fix lunch in a cozy space. Service was quick and attentive I had the fish special and my wife had the pork loin with the fruit sauce. Everything was excellent. The wine list had a nice selection of French and Spanish wines. There is also a kids menu."}
{"text":"Very relaxed atmosphere.  We had wine and shared a salad and a plate of ribs.  The ribs weren't too spicy and were pretty lean.  The weather was nice so they had the front windows open.  I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"So, so bad! Do yourself a favor, walk on by. How in the world can one mess-up a simple creme  de broccoli or a salad...

Service : bad (how hard  is it to replace bread?)
Food : bad;
This is the second and last time that I \"eat\" at this \"restaurant\"."}
{"text":"Stopped in here during the Grand Prix Weekend. They had the street roped off and some music playing outside. We wanted a glass of Mumm so we figured we would sit down and have something small before we met friends at dinner elsewhere. We ordered some wine and the Champagne and a dish of risotto. That short 40 min experience was enough to get us to come back the next night for a full dinner. The risotto was amazing and everything else we ordered was amazing too. The service was friendly but a little bit slow at times. This was probably due to the amount of people in the place. Regardless of that, I would come back here anytime, and if you are in the area you should stop in and try it!"}
{"text":"We stayed in a Hotel on Rue Saint Paul We passed by Les Pyrenees a few times.  In the late 70s I travelled  quite a lot to northern Spain so on a whim we gave Les Pyrenees a try. Boy were we disappointed. I had the seafood soup which pureed. Total lack of seasoning or seafood taste. My wife had the scallops which were presented well but lacked any flavor. We finished with the Paella. One beautiful langoustine  which was so over cooked I could not extract the meat from the shell.The rice chorizo and various seafood was extremely greasy.
Way over priced. Only good thing we found sandwich shop next door where we bought fare for our trip home to Toronto. Best baguette and ham I have ever had outside Paris and an incredible staff."}
{"text":"We had dinner here before heading out to the airport. The food was excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed the fish special, mackerel. I requested some changes to the preparation of the dish and they graciously accommodated me. My husband ordered the paella and said it was very good. The staff was great. Would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal. Duck was on point and the sides more than held to it's standard. Quebec cheese plate was a delight. 

The strength of Les Pyrannes is it's staff. So very welcoming from start-to-finish."}
{"text":"La cuisine est bonne et bien pr√©sent√©e. 
CEPENDANT, hormis une serveuse tr√®s agr√©able, nous avons eut √† faire √† un patron, peu souriant et pas r√©ellement poli. 
De plus, nous y avons d√©j√† mang√© 2 fois et toujours le m√™me probl√®me, il y fait tr√®s froid (climatisation tr√®s forte).
En r√©sum√©, de la bonne cuisine mais une ambiance glaciale !"}
{"text":"Staying in old Montreal for two weeks and have eaten at nearly every restaurant surrounding this place (Venti, Bocata and Barroco).  Those restaurants are phenomenal 5 star places that would stand out in Manhattan.  Les Pyrenees however has bland food and poor service and is quite a bit more expensive than the much better restaurants nearby.  Our server really had a bug up her butt for some reason.  It's worth noting that another server, a taller gentleman was very friendly.  He actually ended up getting our check for us and ringing us up.

Also worth noting is that their pasta is clearly store bought.  Not the end of the world, but it was $23 and the night before I had hand made Bucatini with bacon and a rich sauce at Venti for $9."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant and found it to be the best overall dining experience of our trip. Simon, our server, was amazing! I had the pork cheeks....oh, my....so tender and flavorful. I had no idea that pork could be so good! My daughter had the mussel soup. While I have never heard of that, it was incredible. We will definitely visit here again. And if you do, listen to Simon's recommendations. He knows what he is talking about!"}
{"text":"A solid (authentic) four stars.

Great food.  Terrific presentation. Loved the desserts.  Comfortable place in the evening, though the room layout could use some rethinking. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great service, good atmosphere and fantastic cuisine at a fair price.

My girlfriend and I stopped by for an evening meal. We tried the gazpacho, rotini pasta with chicken and chorizo and the lamb shank. All of the dishes were excellent and the lamb shank was especially soft and tasty. Our server constantly kept tabs on our meal and wellbeing and did an excellent job of explaining the menu. The atmosphere was quiet, relaxing and refreshingly breezy; as they keep shops doors and windows open on nice days. Overall a great experience and we wouldn't hesitate to return!"}
{"text":"We came across this place while waling through Vieux Port during the annual Formula 1 Street Festival. We were immediately attracted by the large paella that was cooking outside - it looked too good to pass up!
This place is a bit touristy in an area full of tourist traps, so somewhat elevated prices come with the territory here. The d√©cor is very nice, however, and bathrooms are kept clean even when very busy. Service varies from gruff to friendly, depending on who you get (we managed to get both at the same time!), but it is professional and experienced. The wine list isn't that deep or varied, but it suffices, I guess.
We started with the chorizo and shrimp risotto - delicious! Properly cooked risotto with a perfect balance of saffron and chorizo, with some tasty grilled shrimp as well. Then we had the salmon with romesco sauce - perfectly cooked salmon with enough of the tasty sauce to mop up with the zingy mashed potatoes. I had the paella (it was the reason we came here, after all!) and it would have been fantastic if it hadn't been overcooked. Plenty of seafood - shrimp, scallops, mussels, very tasty chorizo, and chicken, all in a salty but delicious rice base, but sadly overcooked by quite a bit so all the seafood was hard. A shame, really, because it would have been so good ten minutes earlier. We finished with the bunuelos - cream puff donuts with a chocolate sauce - that were appropriately decadent and delicious.
All in all, the experience was really good. They score 4 stars out of five due to the gruff service, weak wine list, and terribly overcooked paella. But I would be willing to give them another go because everything tasted so good!"}
{"text":"Got a steak. Pretty much shoe leather. Maybe they have better stuff but what I had was terrible. I would not go again. Expensive and not good. Avoid."}
{"text":"This is very cozy restaurant.  Service is great and attentive. Complimentary warm baguette is good start. I walked in here by mistake when I was actually planning to go to a restaurant next door but this was a pleasant surprise.  I tried small portion shrimp/chorizo risotto and it was one of the best risotto I've ever tried. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Perfect meal.  Great atmosphere, nice music, and comfortable seats (and the waiter made sure the table is balanced and not wiggly).  Very good and reasonably priced wine, food was priced for the location but was perfect. We had a bottle of Pinot Grigio, the Risotto for appetizer, the Veggie burger and Spanish Mackerel.   We finished with apple, almonds and caramel ice cream that was perfect.  They even treated us to some nice Sherry. Beautiful outing for two."}
{"text":"Charming experience. Wait staff was knowledgeable and provided great recommendations. The salmon special was fantastic. Sit close to the windows, which are open in good weather."}
{"text":"The owner of the restaurant complained after I initially wrote a one sentence review saying this restaurant was bad.

Well, after Yelp HQ said I need to review my choice of words, I am doing that here.

This place took over a half hour to serve us our salads - how long does it take to do that? It was a slow time and there were hardly any customers around. And the server never came around to fill our waters. Napkins weren't provided, and neither were we given knives to spread butter on our bread. The french onion soup was awful - it was way too salty, which basically made it inedible. One good thing was the saffron soup with mussels. That was delicious, but all the bads far outweighed the goods.

Like I said before, this place is bad. Do not go here. There is a legendary and popular place just across the street called Olive and Gourmando's that always has a long line of waiting customers. We initially wanted to go there but opted for Les Pyreness because there was no wait. Well, that's what we get. When there are few people around it's an indication that maybe that place doesn't have good food or service. That was indeed the case.

Go to O+G and I promise you you'll find the wait will have been worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is my favorite lunch spot. The food, the service, the decor - everything is top notch.
The lunch menus are a great value for the money. At this location you can have a starter, a main course and coffee or tea for less than $20. Beautifully presented, fresh, delicious and served to the table.
Really, get a table there and enjoy, instead of waiting in the line for the sandwich on the other side of the street"}
{"text":"If you are a French food fan this is a religious experience. I had the mussel soup followed by the cassoulet.  French food doesn't get any better. Run don't walk."}
{"text":"Amazing service, great food and wine. They're catch of the day was the salmon and oh my gosh, it was great!"}
{"text":"This restaurant, serving basque cuisine on the border of downtown and old Montreal, is very popular among the crowd I find myself with in Montreal.  The food is good, but I had problems getting descriptions of the dishes from our server, and in fact, consensus at our table was that what he brought me probably wasn't what I ordered (but it was good, and I was kinda undecided anyway, so many things sounded good!).

I really don't like the fact that they push the Sangre do Toro on people -- almost every table had it, and despite my protestations that it was a cheap supermarket table wine, our group got a bottle as our first.  When I picked something else as our second, everyone agreed that it was a marked improvement.

The server also suggested the most boring-sounding dishes.  Between the food suggestions and the wine suggestions, I felt a bit like I was in a standard tourist trap.

So the food -- 4 stars;  but the service attitude knocks off at least one.  By all means go if you're in the mood for this cuisine, but make sure you do your own work on selecting food & wine, and be ready to roll your eyes at the tourist treatment."}
{"text":"Had the cod and chorizo, and while the risotto was actually orzo, the dish was delicious...wine was good, service was adequate...nice atmosphere inside.  A bit pricey but in line with similar restaurants in the area.  Overall very enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"HUGE portions, more than one person can eat.  Expensive.  Mediocre quality.  Average service.  Poor ambiance."}
{"text":"First off, they are very lucky that I am strictly rating them on food and disregarding the service. The server was lost, gave us little information about the daily specials and was so quick to say how our party of eleven did not mention that we had a fix menu (which is false, how else would i have received the fix menu by email). They also have a $3/slice for cake cutting fee, insane. 

With that being said, the food made up for the lack of service. We went with the $40/person fix menu and it was a great decision. From the soup, to the eggplant appetizer, to the lamb main course and chocolate with melting center, everything was delicious! The lamb was so tender, literally just melted in my mouth, the stuffed calamari was a huge portion and the cod was so flavourful! 

I've never been a fan of fixed menus because i use to believe that the portions were small and you left still feeling hungry. Well that was definitely not the case here, I was soooo full and so satisfied with our overall meal. I highly suggest Les Pyrenees for a cute date night or a friends dinner. I had a great experience and would recommend!"}
{"text":"Would highly recommend the squid. Nice ambience for summer, with open windows and ceiling fans. $175 for 4 with wine and dessert."}
{"text":"This is the second time we eat at this restaurant. Today we bring family and friends to share the great cuisine of Catalunya Nord prepared by a Chef from Perpiny√†. The first time we found this place, we were attracted, from a few blocks away by the Senyera Catalana (Catalan Flag) we decided to go in and give it a try!
The staff was great, friendly, attentive accomodating and very aware of the \"Gluten Issue\" of our party! 
Any dish will bring the flavors of the Catalan Cuisine from both sides of the border. Paellas, Catch of the day, crema cremada (Cr√®me br√ªl√©e) a medieval dessert originated in Catalunya is a great flavor to round up any dish!

This place is not cheap. But you get what you pay for and it is worth every penny.   The selection of wine is good and have a couple of my favorites of the Catalan Torres Family Wines (Vilafranca del Pened√®s):  Tres Coronas (Ull de Llebre or Tempranillo grape) and Sangre de Toro (Garnatxa y Carinyena grapes) a great table wine to accompany your meets or even fish and seafood! 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance! Great wine list and good recommendations by our server. We bought a bottle and nursed it for a while and never felt like they were ready for us to scoot. They have plenty of vegetation options, if that's your thing:-) I got the veggie burger which was made from spaghetti squash, red bell peppers, olives, etc. For sure different than any burger I've had in the past. It was served with fries (naturally) and mixed greens, which I appreciated."}
{"text":"Ended up here because nearby Venti couldn't accommodate us until 11 pm at 8:30 pm on a Saturday night during busy Grand Prix weekend.   Lucky that we did arrive here.  The staff was amazing- friendly, informative, efficient.  Our wonderful waiter didn't try to oversell us.  I'd keep on suggesting to split things from the menu with my husband, who ordered the paella, but our waiter cautioned me \"Madame, he will not be able to finish!\".  Who else could get away with calling me a Madame without me kicking them in the shins?!  

My brother had flavorful cold melon and mint soup with his prixe fixe.  So good.  Wanted to lick the bowl clean!    Our toddler turned her nose up at the broccoli and leek soup- no worries as the rest of us devoured it.

My husband's colleague stopped by on his way out and recommended the chorizo.  A superb recommendation.  I ordered a half portion of the risotto with chorizo and shrimp, but guess who at most of it?  Our bug.  Luckily, I pressed for a salad even though the waiter thought we were getting too much food.  The waiter was delighted that our bug gobbled up most of the the dishes.  Well, ok, so did we.  The paella was chock full of seafood and she had her first octopus there.  She ate several, making me worry that she might choke on it.  

For dessert, my brother couldn't decide on the included raspberry mousse or an apple cake which would cost more.  Our trusty waiter steered him towards the mousse which was tasty.  I couldn't decide between any of the many choices and got the classic profiterole.  Stuffed with ice cream.  Chocolate sauce.  SOLD.  Hubby got a lemon sorbet, which the bug promptly hogged.  After a tasty dessert wine, we toddled out of Les Pyrenees.  My favourite restaurant of the trip."}
{"text":"I came here as part of an invite. The service was fantastic and the vibes were cool. I tried some tapas, including Spanish omelette, cod fritters, and chorizo stuffed dates. Pretty yummy! My fave bite of the night was the ceviche (amazing), along with the slow-cooked lamb main. 

Unfortunately, the star of the night - the paella - had some overcooked seafood, probably because of the huge quantity they made for the special night. The presentation of the paella was a showstopper for sure, and the flavour of the saffron rice mixing in with the seafood was decadent. 

We ended the night with 2 dessert choices, one featuring strawberries and pink peppercorns, while the other was an orange gateau. To be honest, I disliked both desserts, with the gateau being bland, while the pink peppercorns were so obnoxious, they left a bad taste in my mouth!

I had a wonderful time with great service and presentation but the food was just not for me... The restaurant itself is located in the Old Port and perfect for date night since it's trendy but not too fancy."}
{"text":"Super excellent food in a great atmosphere! Definitely recommend the food here- the French onion soup was excellent as was a shrimp and risotto appetizer I had. Also enjoyed the fish. They also provide a really excellent bread basket with olive oil and balsamic. Cocktails were fairly good and I was impressed that the bartender came over to ask us about our cocktails and inquire about how they could be improved. Apparently, they've just updated their cocktail menu. The atmosphere is cool with a bull painted on the walls and open windows overlooking the street. Tables are a little close together but not too claustrophobic. The main thing that detracted from our meal here was that our waiter was very, very slow. Slow to take our drink orders, our food orders, bring requested items and bring the check. Don't come here if you're in a hurry, but rather if you want to linger over some unique, delicious food."}
{"text":"Terrific space.  Wait staff knows the menu.  Our meal was very well prepared.  We had to wait as they were busy but the wait was worth it.  Beautiful presentation."}
{"text":"Usually relying on reviews and how busy a place looks we were undecided, but the menu was so enticing we opted for this place for lunch. They would have received 5 stars if they could make a decent Bloody Mary. The food however, having the braised beef cheek, was delicious. The wait staff attentive and friendly, and the window seat on the quaint sidewalk is equally entertaining."}
{"text":"Friendly, lively staff combined with a menu that blends traditional and inventive cuisines from the lands where France and Spain meet.  

The quality of the dishes we ordered  ranged from good to exceptional. The scallops served in a Spanish choriso butter cream sauce with slivers of roasted vegetables landed at the upper end of exceptional. I'd go back just for that. 

Bottom line: Good eats, good service, a little loud and a bit more expensive than I'd like makes it 4 stars."}
{"text":"We had an exceptional evening an meal. The staff was very pleasant and cheerful. The food - outstanding. Had the pork cheeks and chorizo pasta. There was a slight delay, which frankly didn't seem like a delay, and without nary a mention a delicious baby green salad arrived.  This restaurant was a great find and we will return next time we land in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! But a little expensive."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here with my family. A friendly and energetic waitstaff was hard at work taking orders, delivering drinks and food, and topping off water glasses. I had the gazpacho and chorizo w/ crevettes (the chorizo was folded into a delicious cheese, red pepper, and rice blend)...they were outstanding. My wife had the soup of the day (carrot) and the hearts of palm salad, which she loved. My two children split a kid's cheeseburger w/ fries. Dessert was a chocolate ice cream w/ strawberries and raspberries.  This wasn't your typical chocolate ice cream...it was better. The front window was wide open, and the fresh air made dinner delicious and invigorating. This was the best meal we had during our three say stay in Montr√©al. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"What is this place?  So Daniel wasn't feeling too well, but we were hungry so we chose this place out of the others on this block because of price and also the lighter fare.  Not going to lie, this place was super empty - as in there might have been only two other tables filled.  We decided to take our time, so that we could enjoy, digest, and hopefully have Daniel feeling better before we headed back to the hotel.  Daniel had a salad which he really liked and I had the creamy veggie soup which was good.  For the main dish, Daniel had some sort of Risotto dish that he liked, but I had the couscous wraps and they were like so amazing.  For dessert, I indulged in profiteroles  which were only okay.  The service was a bit slow, but we were slow - they were definitely not rushing us.  I feel like this place might be a bit underrated, but again, it is in one of the top food areas of Montreal.  Definitely give this place a try if you are there, but understand if you do, it's going to be a long meal."}
{"text":"Pretty solid place, food was good and the lunchtime pricing is slightly high but still acceptable. Definitely try the shrimp and chorizo risotto - though it's not as al dente as my favorite risotto dishes (since this restaurant is more Spanish French after all) the creamy saffron makes for a scrumptious experience. The mackerel was nice and fresh and kept warm in a extremely hot plate (wish they did that in all restaurants) that allowed you to leisurely eat your dish and have the food remain warm, though it didn't 'wow' me as much as the other Montreal restaurants I recently tried. Service was very attentive. Surprised not to see the place fuller at lunch."}
{"text":"While the flavors are here, the portions simply are not.  Disappointing especially given all the amazing options in Montreal. The restaurant next door has much better atmosphere so try that one!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a Sunday lunch: steak and rognon, both well executed, good wine( slightly expensive) , good service, professional but not overbearing, nothing really not to like"}
{"text":"Very fresh, very clean specially the washroom. 
Love the exqueixada. And the cod is unbelievable highly highly recommended !"}
{"text":"Souper  de famille  samedi soir et nous n'avons pas √©t√© d√©√ßu! Le service est sympathique , efficace...et bilingue, √† la grande joie de la visite am√©ricaine!  Mon mari et moi avons beaucoup aim√© la soupe de poisson, la lotte et les rognons. Les enfants ont appr√©ci√©s les p√¢tes au confit de canard.  Le restaurant n'est pas trop bruyant, ce qui est de plus en plus rare de nos jours."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Why? Because...

1. Staff are SUPER friendly - shoutout to Jeremy (our French waiter) 

2. Location is right in the heart of old town Montreal 

3. Food is delicious 

My colleagues and I dropped into the restaurant around 7:30pm with no reservation and they took us right in. The menu has a good variety, including their daily special menu. 

Service was on point too. We started off with a bottle of wine, a starter and then our entrees. The wait staff provided the wrong entree for one of my colleague but within seconds placed in the correct order. He even gave us extra wine to top off our glass (holla!). 

In the end we decided to order the chocolate cake dessert. It originally comes with whipped cream but again, our waiter came to our rescue and happily swapped the whipped cream with vanilla ice cream when we asked. The best surprise was the dessert drinks he gave each of us! 

I cannot express how awesome the service was. Jeremy not only provided excellent service but went above and beyond by taking a boomerang of us (with multiple tries). Such a great experience to kick off my trip!"}
{"text":"We had a lovely dinner here after just discovering it on an evening walk. The wait staff were attentive and friendly. The food was delicious. We had the Spanish style mackerel and the vegetarian pasta. The menu featured Catalan dishes. The wise staff were handily bilingual. Only minus was the TV screen in the corner which seemed out of place in such a nice dining establishment."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times. Delicious and beautiful food. Good wines. Fairly quiet ambiance. Several vegetarian options. They do fish exceptionally well. I eat here every time I visit Montreal."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner. 
Paella:  Flavorful, large portion, overflowing with fresh seafood. 
Vegetables Miller Feuille (vegetarian eggplant dish): yummy, delightful.  Egplants, peppers and polenta. Very tasty. 
Shredded Cod Salad:  This appetizer, so affordable at 9 Canadian dollars, was fantastic. Beautiful too.

Would make a special trip just to come here."}
{"text":"Friendly service and excellent food.

Landed here with a group of friends after Barocco lost my table reservation!

I took the braised pork chick and it was tender and full of flavour! The sauce was so well balanced.

All of my friends were extremely happy with their dish as well.

The two bottles of wine we selected were also excellent.

Will definitely recommend and come back. Price was also very reasonable given the fact that the restaurant is located in the old port."}
{"text":"For the price, I was certainly underwhelmed.  We were a party of four adults and one child and ordered wine, appetizers, entrees and desserts.  We wanted a taste of the tapas, but the waitress said we would need two. The sampling on one plate was more than sufficient.  The celery soup was watery without sufficient flavor. The pasta was over cooked and the sauce, although nice, lacked the warm smokey spiciness from espelette peppers.   The monkfish was nice, but the dishes seemed to be hit or miss.  We sampled five desserts and the presentation on two looked like they wiped off a chocolate dessert and put the next one on.  The creme br√ªl√©e was perfect, the orange cake was acceptable and the mousse was average.  Overall, I would expect better quality at those prices."}
{"text":"I decided to try this restaurant as they have a few vegetarian options.  Its located on Rue St Paul, which is the oldest street in Montreal. The restaurant is well decorated and as we were going through the menu, the waitress came out and welcomed us in.

The service was good and attentive.  I decided to try one of their vegetarian burgers (picture attached).  It was ok.  I should have tried the couscous I feel.  The burger was a bit bland for my taste.  But I like the fact that there are other vegetarian options to try, and not just one that vegetarians are stuck with.

If you are a vegetarian, definitely try out this place. I wasnt too pleased with what I ordered, but I am sure the other entrees would be better."}
{"text":"Bonne d√©couverte en famille avec 2 enfants. Une salade en entr√©e Et pour suivre une paella et b¬úuf de b¬úuf. Les enfants croquettes de poulet Et cheeseburger. Les dessert aussi excellent!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a snowy evening and was greeted by Joey who was eager to served us the mussels we've craving for a few days in Montreal.  Both Joey and the mussels did not disappoint with a flavorful tomato base with green olives.  Frites were crispy but I wished they were the long thin variety, good nonetheless.

The Mahi Mahi Carpaccio was amazing with micro asparagus and a nice delicate vinaigrette on top of two slices of eggplant.  

The four tapas assortment equally great mussels salad, duck confit, seafood mousse was good but slightly bland and a honey cheese.

Enjoyed our first time at Les Pyrenees."}
{"text":"This restaurant caught my eye and my fancy as I was working my way through Old Montreal. I glanced through the broad glass storefront and saw pretty wine glasses sitting on a glossy wooden table with red chairs. A couple of guys were in back setting up, and when saw me peering in they waved. That was it! I knew I wanted a glass of wine there. And I wasn't disappointed. It's a lovely small restaurant with soft lighting and a casual vibe. Our waiter Simon had a little trouble with English but was so friendly that it was endearing. He had a wonderful sense of humor and took care of us very well. The three of us had the sea bass special, scallops, risotto with shrimp and chorizo, and field green salads -- all tasty and beautifully presented. The wine list was thoughtfully curated and we had plenty of help choosing. We even had dessert! The creme br√ªl√©e with orange zest was nice, but we liked even better the bit of almond cake with a swoosh of raspberry jam that came alongside it. The profiteroles with dark chocolate sauce and berries were spectacular -- I would have licked the plate if no one was looking. A sweet dessert wine came gratis. We didn't really care for it, but it was a nice gesture. This was definitely my favorite meal in Montreal. I absolutely loved the place!"}
{"text":"5 stars by far!!! We stopped for lunch while riding our bikes.  We were not dressed as nearly well as the other patrons.  But Edwardo was very welcoming at the front door even with our 2 kids ages 9 and 11.  We felt out of place.  Since we eat fish and vegetarian not many places have lots of choices, but here they had plenty for us choose from.  My kids ordered the eggplant veggie lasagna and the goat cheese cake with veggies.  They loved it.  Our son Justin wanted to eat every meal there.  I had the mussels which was an incredible value. It was beyond a big bowl for $13.95! Edwardo took great care of us and made feel very welcome in our bike gear.  We would totally go back.  They really deserve a five star rating but Yelp likes to keep things real and favor 4 stars over 5 stars.  So I am trying not get this review filtered."}
{"text":"Tourist trap. Be careful guys.

This restaurant is pretty good looking. Trendy architecture, comfy seating. Service was ok.

I had high expectations of the food there based on the previous reviews about this place. I was very disappointed. Italian sausages pasta were overcooked and didn't have a lot of flavour. There is a range of vegetarian options on their menu and I decided to get the v√©g√© burger. The plate / presentation was simple and the burger was just ok. 

You have to expect prices to be higher in Old Port since it's Old Port, but this was way overpriced.

I won't go back there for sure. In a few cases, I give the restaurant a second try, but not this one."}
{"text":"Went to eat here with my boyfriend and we are never that complicated couple but this was an interesting experience. Looks wise, the restaurant is cute but that's all it is. The meal started off ok, we ordered a pitcher of sangria. We then ordered a plate of Catalan style tapas to share. I would give that a 6.5/10, it was decent but overpriced. Following was the seafood paella. It was very disappointing, tasted like it was from an Uncle Benn's microwaveable rice bag. During our meal we changed spots because there was a very loud group next to us, but that's beyond the restaurants control. After we payed, I was waiting outside for my boyfriend and our obnoxious french waiter came to stand at the door and yelled \"leave\". I'm guessing that was because a couple outside asked me if the food was good and I said \"it wasn't that great\". All this to say, just avoid this place. There are so many better places in old Montreal."}
{"text":"Came here early on a quiet Sunday night in late February with my son and wife. Kids menu was excellent! My son loves steak and the kids steak was perfectly done, better than most steaks I've had on adult menus in other restaurants. I had the fish of the day, Spanish mackerel, perfectly done with garlic in the slightly sweet sauce as accompaniment. My wife had the Quebec lamb shank. She's usually a light eater, but she finished the entire main course citing its flavor. Service was commendable, with a very friendly bilingual staff, and very accommodating to our 11 year old. Recommend this place strongly, my son made me promise we would be back."}
{"text":"What a wonderful restaurant.  We stopped by for lunch and ordered three of the lunch specials and a child menu.  The specials came with a small appetizer and coffee included.  The gazpacho,  crispy fish salad,  and child burger were awesome.  Everything was very fresh,  beautifully presented and well seasoned. The staff was child friendly, smiling and helpful - we couldn't have asked for more, especially given the reasonable prices.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was a great find! For kids, the bread was great and the chicken fingers were solid. Great that it had a kids menu. The vegetarian lasagna was delicious as was the goat cheese salad. The portions were generous. We would go again."}
{"text":"Really great food, attention to detail, and great service. Plenty of vegetarian options too!"}
{"text":"My paella was very expensive- and very dry. Glad I could expense the bill. The rice tasted good but I didn't pick paella for rice alone. Mussels were tiny and tough, shrimp and fish very dry. My colleagues were unimpressed but we were all starving so ate what we could. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing. Almost everyone got the catch of the day, which was Salmon...BOMB! I had the pasta which was also really good. Service was great and the ambiance was really nice as well. The waiter even gave us all complementary dessert wine at the end of our meal. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is a fab place! Jeremy our server was the best. Loved the food, service, wine, dessert everything here. 
We ordered Paella, seafood pasta, lamb shank ( awesome)!
They got me the wrong pasta and were so apologetic about it! Got us free wine..! Extra drinks..! Got me the pasta I had ordered in 10 mins! 
Love this place, must visit when are in a mood for Spanish + French foood!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here today, first day in Montreal,   at the suggestion of the concierge at my hotel.
I walked into Old town, which is enjoyable. And did not have a hard time finding the place. The waiters were very kind and did not mind speaking 50/50 French and English with me. ( I am very rusty) I was seated promptly, and received bread, butter and my drink order pretty speedily.
I looked over the menu, and decided to go with the tapas, which I was told included risotto, some stew, a (Spanish) tortilla, and a mini-open faced style tuna salad crostini. the waiter was pretty much correct, except, to my chagrin, the risotto with chorizo ended up being replaced with some sort of extremely unappetizing calamari. Points off for the inaccuracy of the dish description, and the indescribably bad, extremely heavy, overly spiced, strange textured calamari, which turns my stomach to think back on. The stew was fine, a bit tough, but good flavour. The tortilla was a bit over spiced too, actually (think too much liquid smoke) and the sort of \"tuna crostini\" that rounded the dish out seemed to have been sitting out for a bit.
The positive was my $5 \"green salad\" was huge, and the vinaigrette had a lot of interest, not sure what they put in there. It brought out the happy Californian in me to see so many beautiful baby greens. And as I have said, the service was very friendly, and efficient. Strangely, the butter came in little single service plastic tubs, though, which seemed a bit cafeteria style, of such an otherwise trendy spot. Also, The sangria was decent.
I will probably not go back, but that is not entirely the fault of the restaurant, it just seems there are better places around for the price. Would have loved to have tasted the chorizo risotto!"}
{"text":"Very French, very good, very quaint. Located on St. Paul Street (the most quaint area of Montreal) with lovely ambience and lots of pretty people."}
{"text":"Yet another fantastic and decadent meal in old Montreal. We started with an anchovies pie - so different and delicious. I had a perfectly grilled cod fillet on a bed of the yummiest spicy chorizo and sun dried tomatoes on risotto.  My boyfriend had fisherman's stew - which had a ton of seafood in a beautiful broth. We were completely satisfied, and impressed with the originality of each dish.  We also liked how relatively inexpensive the meal was. There was no wait, but it was obvious the rest of the patrons were enjoying their meals also. I am glad we didn't wait in line somewhere else."}
{"text":"Oh come on, this place wasn't so bad! In fact it was pretty good.

I thought all the dishes were tasty, and they all were plenty of food. We picked our own red wine, so we didn't have to get pushed by the waiters to pick crappy wine. My entree was the dish with chicken and Spanish chorizo. It was definitely excellent. 

Our desserts were all huge! I got the creme brulee and it was way too much for me to handle.

I'd recommend this place for anyone looking to get some French food, Pyrenees style."}
{"text":"Sometimes you end up at a place because it is just there. Maybe your blood sugar has dropped so low that even eating a cough drop can make the difference between a sane functioning person and a version of Jack Nicholson with an axe in the movie \"The Shining.\" I wasn't quite at this point, but I was close. We had passed cafe after tourist filled cafe and then we turned a corner and there stood Les Pyrenees, kind of lonely on the street. Being about 2:30pm only two tables were full (not necessarily a good sign) but unless I got at least a glass of wine to tide me over I was about to become very evil. We stepped up to the menu and the Maitre D' swooped (literally) from inside and asked if we would like to come in. I know I was startled and we said \"not yet.\" I quickly scan the menu - tapas, seafood, lamb...I can't focus...let's just go in, I need a piece of bread, quick. We were quickly seated next to the other two tables maybe they should have spread us out more to make the place look busy? (ok, I will stop nit picking). Anyway, the server stopped by our table and asked if we wanted anything to drink. I couldn't get the word \"wine\" out of my mouth fast enough. Sensing my sense of urgency - the glass appeared almost immediately as did the bread. I had some random Sauvignon Blanc - but it was actually good and the bread and butter made me feel normal again. Having been to Spain, I was reluctant to order tapas in this location so I settled on Lamb (braised for 12 hours? I can't remember in my hypoglycemic stupor) and my brother decided on a salade, fish soup and shrimp risotto (as you can see I was so out of wack I didn't even order a salad or appetizer as is the norm for me). The salad was fresh (nothing wilted) and had a nice vinaigrette. The fish soup was also quite good, not too rich, not too salty, perfect temperature. Definitely hit the spot on a sunny afternoon. Now the plat principales were brought to the table and to my delight there was quite a bit of lamb. It was tender and well seasoned. My only complaint was regarding the unintentionally crunchy potatoes - just cooking perhaps 10 more minutes would have taken care of that. They were hidden under the lamb (perhaps where they belonged). The risotto was lovely, smooth, creamy, teaming with shrimp (and most important - not crunchy at all). This turned out to be the best risotto I had on this trip. We watched as they brought desserts to the next table - they both looked so delicious. Sadly, we did not partake in this course (and now I am regretting it!). This meal was solid and I thought the price was right. I like the ambiance of the place and we joked around with the wait staff and I had what I called a life saving experience in here. I had no complaints about the service, the food (except those darned crunchy potatoes) and my overall experience was very positive."}
{"text":"Ich hatte einen frischen gr√ºnen Salat an einer gelungenen Sauce mit angenehmer Essignote. Darauf folgte ein perfekt nach Wunsch gebratenes Steak (das f√ºr den relativ hohen Preis aber zu klein war). Leider war das dazu servierte Kartoffelp√ºree fast kalt und nichts Besonderes. Daf√ºr war die kleine Gem√ºsebeilage wieder top.

Die Bedienung war freundlich und aufmerksam, insgesamt sorgte das Ambiente f√ºr einen tollen Abend."}
{"text":"ok, sorry to skew the ratings on this place, but i had one experience with one dish, and frankly, it was fantastic.  

last summer we visited this place and ordered the mussels.  simply, one of the single best meals i have ever had.  simple.  elegant.  perfectly prepared.  after eating it, it's all i wanted to eat.  i was devastated to reach the bottom of the bowl.  

i know a single review and a single dish does not make or break a restaurant, but the memory of that meal lives on as one of the best i've ever had."}
{"text":"Carlos is the man!
Made us two brushetta (one on the house) 
had couscous with the best sweet potato in cheese sauce!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I've been to many places and honestly I had never have such hard time getting extra bread or balsamic vinegar. I mean we asked 4 times for more and we given 3 more pieces of bread ( one piece of bread per person). 
The food was good, nothing OMG special but we did end up paying 260 dinner for three ... And the portions are not enough so be aware if you are looking for a nice piece of meat on your plate this is not the place to visit."}
{"text":"In old city next to several very good restuarants that are always busy and hard to get in.  Which is why we wound up here.  They have a prix fixe type deal with an app, dinner and a dessert for 20-30$ pay for your entree price only.  I ordered calf liver and had to send it back to the kitchen.  It was overly salted and the meat had an off flavor.  The sauce was good though.  Instead i ordered the duck breast which was allright but chewy on the tough side.  My husband ordered the mussels which again where not that great.  The owner is from southern france/ spain area which ive been too but the food more reflected making a profit.  It wasnt good.  The service however was awesome and attentive.  I cant say enough good things about the waiter that took care of us.  
We were in Montreal for a week during the Jazz fest and could have eaten anywhere else much better for the same price.  But in the old area you need to be careful of tourist traps and i fear that this is one of them since the concierges of nearby hotels reccomend this place i think they must get a kick back or something because the food was very mediocre.  And i say that kindly."}
