{"text":"I want this place to do well, I really do! Delicious food (my sandwich was incredible), great coffee, pleasant surroundings and sunny. Here's the thing: the vibe is a bit strange. The owner (?) treats the place like his living room, blasting pretty bad music and loudly singing along. I usually go to cafes to read, hang with friends and chill out, but the atmosphere was kind of aggressive with lots of dudes taking up a lot of space. Wasn't so comfortable. Still, I'll  give it another chance since the food/drinks were so good."}
{"text":"we came here based on good reviews my boyfriend (yummy baked goods, good coffee) read online and got pretty disappointed by the lack of costumer service here.
The young guy at the counter seemed sleepy and not a tad interested in us.
He didn't care about being welcoming and friendly at all.
We asked if they could put some chocolate in the latte (since they didn't have mocha on the menue) and despite the fact that they have hot chocolate on the menu, he told us they didn't have any chocolate. what?!
We asked if they had wifi and we had to repeat the question 4 times until he understood. 
I always wonder why people like him work in costumer service.

Apart from that, the cafe was sticky so we opened the door ourselves. 
Cant say anything on the pastries, maybe thats their best feature."}
{"text":"What a great way to start my day 4/7 days a week. If you get there early enough and are lucky to get either Paulina or Vito you know you're going to get a good laugh in. I mostly get my food to go but I always stay to have my espresso at the counter. 

I love the house cured bacon breakfast sandwich before noon and if I get there late I always go to my go to Turkey club although I did venture out lately for a bagel or the Piri Piri Chicken sandwich. MMMMM ALways. On certain days I sneak in the killer fresh bakes cookies. If you're a Starbucks person then go across the street but I'll take local and a fresh espresso any day.

I haven't even lived in The Junction for a year and it's easily my fav part of Toronto."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrid! Terrrible food, worse service. Ordered for two; exactly the same order: bagel with salmon and cream cheese. Server took our order THREE DIFFERENT TIMES! When it finally arrived....after 20 minutes it had so little cream cheese that I actually felt insulted by how little cream cheese was on it. You could only barely see the cream cheese with the naked eye. The plates were 'garnished' with the butt end of a quarter of a slice of tomato. Again, an insult. One of our bagels was actually pieced together by bits of other bagels, hand to god. To top it all off, we paid about $7 per bagel. When the staff at Locomotive thinks quality this low is OK to put on a plate and serve to people, do you even bother to try to explain what is wrong with that? No, you just never, ever return."}
{"text":"This place used to be great but now they have replaced the staff and they are all incredibly rude. This one girl serving me kept wiping her nose non stop and could only grunt at me. Not surprised that it is always empty and creama coffee across the street is full. I live in the area and I can honestly say this is the only coffee shop that I wouldn't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I noticed that things can vary here depending on the day/who is working. This is both in terms of how smoothly things run and the quality of food/coffee. Food is especially adventurous in terms of how long it will take and what it will taste like. I've waited over 30 min and under 10 min for the same thing here and I've had the same thing taste wildly different - good and bad - depending on who was working in the kitchen (time does not factor into taste). I would say more consistency towards the good days here would make this place golden every time."}

Beef Brisket Sandwich
This was good for the price. Home made tasting. The brisket could have used a little bit more seasoning or ingredients to be truly exceptional and \"something to write home about\". But it's fine the way it is and I'd order it again.

THE BROWNIE
Cot damn that's some good brownie. THAT icing. 
All around, perfect amount of sweetness. If you like it extra sweet that you need milk, maybe try the Skor brownie instead though (which I'll probably try on my next visit).

Nestea Iced Tea (Can)
Yeah that's some Nestea Iced Tea in a can alright.

Service was fine and quick.

I'll be back to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"If you want squiggles on your foam, go across the street. If you want truly excellent coffee, go to Locomotive. Sandwiches have a good taste/cost ratio. Love the House cured wild pacific salmon. Power outlets at 5 feet intervals, so there isn't a table without a nearby plug-in."}
{"text":"I would recommend it. I had hot brisket sandwich, which was yummy and oozing with meat juice, on a chilly day. Good friendly service. People can just relax and chat enjoying the train themed decor. Very neighbourhood place and an antidote to Starbucks."}
{"text":"When locomotive first opened, it became my favorite local coffee house in the Junction. I love the taste of their coffee, very smooth and European, unlike the other independent coffee places nearby which have pretty harsh, burnt tasting coffee. 

Everything was great until we stopped being served by the owner or familiar baristas. Recently, every time we went there was a new barista who seemed confused and asked me to repeat my order several times, then made my drink pretty poorly. 

In example, this last time I ordered a simple soy latte. The girl started making a chai latte. After i'd corrected her, she finished the drink and asked what kind of milk i'd like...

I'm not sure we'll be going back very often now unfortunately."}
{"text":"Killer beef brisket sammy. Nice folks."}
{"text":"I went there to order a BLT and green tea for breakfirst.
Total is $6.5 puls tax. It included  lettuce, tomato, homemade mayo. It was fresh and its taste good."}
{"text":"Love this coffee shop, I went in for the first time a couple months ago and decided to try it instead of the boring starbucks across the street (blah). What I found was friendly customer service, and such delicious coffee! I have tried their breakfast sandwiches (meat cured/prepared in-house) as well as some loafs, all of which are delicious! Highly recommend Locomotive!"}
{"text":"Just went there with my son. It was mellow and nice, awesome tosta, nice coffee, an unpretentious, friendly place. Love it."}
{"text":"One of my first mornings out in the junction I happened upon Locomotive to meet some new friends for a coffee. I'd already had brunch coffee (you know the bottomless kind) but it wasn't helping to turn my internal motor over to help me get my Sunday game face on.

I decided on an Americano (my go to drink) as the best way to accomplish my goal and as the best way to rate this spot. The Americano certainly achieved the goal of giving me a boost and provided no burnout later - a plus.

As for taste, it was good jut not the best Americano I've had to date. That said, I want to come back again to give it another go and grab a taste of their food/baked goods so I can give them a more full/well rounded review.

I will note that the staff, while unique, are all very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Wandering around my new neighbourhood, I was looking for a good take-out lunch type of place. It's only been a week, and I've been to Locomotive twice now, and really like it. 

The sandwiches are always prepared fresh, and yes, takes longer than normal but it's worth the wait. My only thing, is that I'd make sure to ask them to cut it in half - I seem to make a big mess eating them. 

The sandwiches range from $6-8, and are hot and toasty. I've had the Porchetta, but my favourite so far is the Roast Beef (which you might need a bib for). 

They also have breakfast, coffee and salads available. 

The rustic decor is really homey, and I loved staring at the puzzles of train stations on the wall. Great place lunch, and a good alternative to Starbucks/Crema for a meeting or catching up on life."}
{"text":"This is my favourite coffee shop in the neighbourhood. With many places to choose from I go out of my way to go to Locomotive. Their Americanos are great. Not to week, not too bitter, just right. The staff is lovely as well."}
{"text":"I try not to eat many sandwiches, but when I do, I'm super grateful to have some of the best in the city so close nearby.

When you go to Locomotive you really feel the presence of the owners in the cafe and you feel that when you go up to the bar. The cafe is sort of like a big hangout for the owners you can feel that they really enjoy talking with all of their customers and take pride in the quality of the food they serve.

Each of their sandwiches are amazing and until you figure out what your favourite is, it will be hard to choose because each option is delicious. Locomotive also does a good job when it comes to what I find are the extras, coffee and treats.

They can make you some great almond milk cappuccinos or lattes and each of their treats are big, eye-catching, hard to resist, and delicious."}
{"text":"Ridiculously priced coffee. Large drip iced coffee was $3.75. This was just hot drip coffee with ice cubes put into it. They melted within minutes and created a very diluted room temperature coffee.... Drip coffee should only be around $2, even places more artisanal coffee shops like tearo only charges $2.25 for a large drip coffee. Ice should not be an additional cost. It's also idiotic as a coffee shop to intentionally dilute your hot coffee with ice. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"My new go-to for breakfast sandwiches!
Their egg & bacon sandwich is amazing.
Fabulous crusty bun. House-cured bacon, and crispy! :)
House made ketchup too!

For lunch, I almost always get the Beef Brisket sandwich. Again, brisket of made in-house. These guys do it right!

Oh, and their espresso/americano/etc is one of the best you'll get anywhere.

It does help that I love trains, especially old steamers. So there's lots to look at there as well :)"}
{"text":"This review is entirely based on the brownies.  A coworker has bought bagels with cream cheese and brownies from here.  They have two types that I know of, one that has caramel and skor chocolate bar mmm...and another one that is just a regular brownie.  

I find the one with the caramel and chocolate to be very sweet, too sweet for me but really good.  It's really gooey too because of all the caramel.

I LOVE the regular brownie, no words can describe how good it tastes.  

Can't comment on the service as a coworker has bought from here everytime.  

Brownie awesomeness!"}
{"text":"Came here with my dad and my son. The coffee was great, and the vibe relaxed. Not pretentious or or over the top as some of the places in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Locomotive has an amazing beef brisket sandwich. They have other options such as a chicken and vegetarian sandwich.

You can't miss this place. It is right across the street from Starbucks in the Junction.

Service is order at the counter and get your drinks from the cooler. They have soft drinks, root beer, and bottled waters.

Locomotive also has coffee and pastries. The Skor brownie (3$) was delicious as well.

Total cost for a sandwich, root beer and brownie was around 15$. The sandwich did not include sides. There was some slaw on a big plate in the case, but there was no clear indicator of portion sizes or price, so I left it alone.

This is a good place to eat lunch or enjoy coffee. The service is not amazing, just ok."}
{"text":"I've been here three times with friends and family and they always tell me they like the place.

It's a clean place and it seems to have a theme going on. I feel like I am walking into someone's living room and I feel comfortable. 

I have tried their Americano and Macchiato. Either one goes great with my favourite sandwich, the Mushroom Melt with that yummy pesto!

I love this place for brunch and am very happy that it was added to the Junction!"}
{"text":"The cured salmon, I assume it's house cured, is super excellent. And so was the BLT bagel."}
{"text":"If you like small local establishments with great friendly service and simple yet fresh and yummy food, then this place is for you:-))) It was my first time there and it's now in my list of 'go to' places:-))"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place... and in honesty it has all the right ingredients to succeed except I felt Locomotive failed on so many levels.

The location is great. Unlike Crema, there are usually plenty of seats available and the WiFi seemed reliable. The good stops there.

Our barista seemed frazzled... \"Oh no there are customers!\" She took our orders for two lattes and proceeded to serve and make two other orders before she bothered making my latte. I waited 10 minutes at the counter! The latte was ok, but nothing special.

The door also proved to be an issue. as patrons walked in, the hinges on the door prevented it from closing tightly. This resulted in the door constantly swinging open whenever there was a gust of wind. I must have closed it 5 times while I was there."}
{"text":"Locomotive is nice neighbourhood coffee shop! A great place to chill out with your friends or alone.

I tried their cappuccino and espresso which were both well made using Rufino beans roasted at Classic Gourmet Coffee in Vaughan.

I cannot comment on the baked good or food, I will definitely try some of their offerings: Brownie!!"}
