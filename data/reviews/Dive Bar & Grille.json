{"text":"Had the Alabama slammer burger and greatly recommend it.  Wife had the Mediterranean wrap and it also was delicious. Was busy on Saturday evening and service was good.  Good place to stop if in area."}
{"text":"This place is a must try when in Wexford, PA. Every plate I tried here was absolutely phenomenal!!! We came here for brunch and they had a lot of brunch items to choose from. We came here with a party of 8 so I got to try several different things off of the brunch menu and everything I tried was delicious. The prices are very reasonable too for the quality of food you get. The food here could be in a fine dining restaurant. Their staff was very friendly as well, excellent customer service. The servers were very attentive and made sure we were taken care of. We will definitely be coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"The improved menu really hit the spot. I do like this place. The acoustics are challenging at times and the service is fair, but the food makes me go back. Their lunch is also pretty good too."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on a Saturday night at 8 p.m. Sat at the bar. Great service - I was greeted promptly, asked the (friendly and helpful) bartender some beer questions, and had my drink within 2 minutes. Beer price was average. 

Second trip was on a Saturday night before 7 pm ... I was amazed (in a good way) that they had a weekend happy hour. Had a mojito and shared a (half price) buffalo egg roll app. The food and the service were both good."}
{"text":"Do not go here. Poor service. Overpriced drinks. Dont even think about watching sports there. No sound. And what bar in western PA doesn't have yuengling on tap...Dive doesn't. The menu ofder very few decent selections and good luck placing an order if they're busy. They're understaffed so you'll have to wait. 

Oh yeah don't even think about wasting your money on the juke box. The bar tender and owner will skip your songs you just payed a dollar each for"}
{"text":"On a busy Friday night, the method for getting a table was less than organized. We were told it was first come first serve but the waitress said she would make sure we were the next to get a table. Apparently several other of the wait staff promised the same thing to others who arrived after us because we saw several people ushered to tables as we continued to wait. When we were finally seated and got food, it was mostly mediocre. Too many items on the menu meant lots of pre-made, not fresh items. The atmosphere was very generic (not great in a strip mall anyway) and service was generally slow. Dessert was disappointing to top off the night. Definitely won't go back."}
{"text":"'More like 4.5 stars!  Love this place! Their happy hour is great- 1/2 price apps and drink specials.  Their food is great, we didn't try anything we didn't like! It is very small inside and LOUD!  They have a children's menu and I did see some people with children, so it seems fairly kid friendly!  It is also super affordable for a family! 

I would give a full 5 stars but the service was a little iffy, granted it was busy but no drink refills and a little slow."}
{"text":"This is our go to watering hole!  Great drink specials Saturday night.  All of the entrees I've tried have been very good.  But the BEST choice in my opinion though are the burgers.  Always juicy, fresh bun and toppings.  Looking for a standout burger with a little kick?  Try the \"South of the border\" burger!  You really can't go wrong at dive!"}
{"text":"To start off, the food is terrific. We've been here many times over the years, but this was only the second time for brunch. So why only two stars? Coffee. They don't serve decaf, and they don't serve half and half or coffee cream. The kitchen does not have milk. To me, this is unbelievable. So no one has ever asked for decaf before today? The owners, who claim to have 18 years of restaurant experience between them, never thought about this? Having a pot of decaf and a box of creamers available at Sunday brunch is part of the cost of doing business, even if nobody uses them. The cost of not having them is this review."}
{"text":"It's a dive bar (literally) done better.

It really is like a dive bar for the middle upper class.  The food is bar food but done better. There really is no atmosphere (like most true dive bars) but the bathrooms are usually cleaner.

Interesting place.  Depends what your expectations are. I am a big fan of a dive bar.
But hate that the food at such places usually stinks.  So the Dive Bar and Grill really hits the spot."}
{"text":"Big fan of Dive Bar - we live close by and go there frequently.  Wife and kids can easily find something on the menu they enjoy.  Prices are reasonable and the portions are good.  Nice selection of beers on tap."}
{"text":"We love Dive.  It's become our go-to place when we're all in the mood for different things.  The kids can get plain pasta, and my husband and I can get just about anything.  The wings are always excellent.  The buffalo sauce is perfect and the wings are a great size.  The sliders are excellent.  You simply cannot beat the 5-7pm Happy Hour and their $5 burger specials throughout the week.  I do agree with other reviewers who say they need a hostess stand.  Too often we walk in when it's still pretty empty and the servers stare at us awkwardly from across the bar.  That's really my only complaint.  A hostess to greet you, to escort you to a table, would be much better.  But the food is great and the prices are excellent at Happy Hour.  We've been going at least once a week for the last six months."}
{"text":"We've been to this place a few times. Overall I rate it a 3.5; however, based on our last visit, we won't be back for a while. 

The best thing about this bar is the beer selection. The bartenders are knowledgeable about what they serve, too. The food menu, in contrast, is a little bit weird. As huge as it is, there are only a few items that appeal to me. I am keen to try the buffalo chicken mac and cheese, but I refuse to pay $16 for it! I'll have to rely on others to find out of its good. 

On to my complaints. When you're walking up to the place, it's not easy to find the front door! When it's crowded, the seating arrangements are a free for all. My biggest complaint on our most recent visit was that it was unbearably cold. We were on the waiting list for a table, but had to leave because it was so cold. People (men and women) had jackets on inside. We talked to the manager, who did not even apologize for our discomfort, nor did he express disappointment that we were leaving his establishment to eat and drink elsewhere. We'll be back, but we will wait until air conditioning season is past."}
{"text":"Nice place with a menu that is interesting but just missed the mark on execution. The food was almost good and the \"chef\" was certainly trying.

I would not recommend this place if you are using a groupon or living social coupon.  Over half of the items we ordered were not covered by the coupon.  The final insult was we had to spend an extra $10 on desserts we did not want just to use the entire coupon.  

Not going back soon!"}
{"text":"I just recently relocated to a different state and applied for a new driver's license. The way they do it there, they printed out my paper \"temporary driver's license\" and stapled it to my old one, informing me that my new driver's license will be coming in the mail in a few weeks. A few days later I was in Pittsburgh for my friend's wedding. We hit no less than ten different spots in town during the bachelor party. Not one place gave me a hard time about my ID.

Two weeks later I was back in the Pittsburgh area, then celebrating my cousin's birthday at Dive. This bartender served me one beer, while telling me they could serve me only one beer because they cannot accept my proof of identification. My ID clearly reads \"TEMPORARY OPERATOR LICENSE\" and contains all the information necessary for them to check and make sure it's legitimate. But the lazy dunce bartender just says \"I can't accept this\" and incoherently argues with me about it for a few minutes. Later I ask the waiter for a beer and he gives me some lame excuse, \"I would gladly serve you but that asshole bartender is my boss...how about x orders two beers and he can give one to you...\" These knuckleheads are lucky, if it wasn't my dear cousin's birthday celebration I would have gladly made a huge scene. This bar is expensive and trendy and that's the only reason they are still in business. It's a nice, classy-looking spot but there are morons running it. I will gladly go to any real dive in the North Hills, Cranberry or even Zelienople before I go back to Dive."}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails and delicious burgers. Also, the service is always fast. The only downside is that It is pretty loud at times, but we usually appreciate that because it drowns out the noise of our toddlers. :)"}
{"text":"Great service, interesting menu. Bland interior. 

I got the South of the Border burger. It was good, but nothing special. 
My boyfriend ordered the Knuckle sandwich and while he enjoyed it at the time, it actually made him sick in his stomach later that evening. I think it was a combination of the buttered bread, brown sugar butter with the sweet potato tots, cole slaw, etc. He was also disappointed with the portion of sweet potato tots he was given. Unsure if we will return."}
{"text":"This is a great smaller \"bar\" away from most of the crowd in Wexford. Reasonably priced and I've always had good service here. Moved into the area about a year ago and was really glad to find this place. It is kept clean and the food while not 5 star is excellent for what it is. If you want a 5 star restaurant then this isn't your place. If you want a great drink selection and food without the crowds, then this is your spot."}
{"text":"Great place.  The menu is quite extensive for a bar style-restaurant, the food and service are high quality, the TV's are well-placed, and it is kid-friendly most nights.  The only thing that should be improved is the addition of more wheat beers on tap."}
{"text":"Over all a very nice meal. Fresh deep fried mushrooms to start were very good; the horseradish sauce was a little bland.  Risotto with skirt steak was excellent.  The ahi tuna was well executed, but not as good as the risotto dish. Prompt and pleasant staff.  A little loud/echoey and a bit cold."}
{"text":"Dive is true to its name in one sense only. It is a friendly place where they're always glad to see you. It has one of the best happy hour menu's in the area. We go there often, and always enjoy the rotating draft, menu drink specials, and happy hour eats. Their full menu meals are also a plus. Go there, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I frequent the dive in lawrenceville, and it is great! So when we needed to find a place for brunch in Wexford this was the obvious choice.  The bar appeared to be grossly understaffed resulting in  an hour and a half wait that did not end with us getting our entrees. The staff was unapologetic and basically stated that it wasn't their fault. I will never return to this location again and suggest that you only do so if you have HOURS to spend waiting for your meal!"}
{"text":"Yes, I love some things on the Dive Bar's menu--the Greek Bowl, the Camburger (especially on Wednesday when they are the special)--the menu is sort of pub food on steroids--why do waffles when you can do funnelcake?  Great ideas, maybe not great in execution.  As for the bar---tsk tsk.  I thought it was a lousy bartender at first, now I recognize the bar is just not good.  Order draft (and pray the keg wasn't just kicked), do not order a cocktail.  I got sucked into the mojito special--also known as soda with lime and mint.  I thought it was me until a server mixed me one and it actually tasted like a mojito.  We were there again for St. Patrick's Day--Guinness was the special. .. but it was a can, a warm can that had been sitting open until it was flat, too.  And, my friends ordered mojitos--again, known as soda with lime or mint.  So now I know it wasn't me."}
{"text":"Great food with large serving sizes. Happy Hour here us a treat with 1/2 off Appetizers and Sliders all of which are delicious."}
{"text":"Went here on a slow weekday night after work and it was pretty quiet with maybe only 4-5 tables in use (as opposed to a Friday when we stopped by and the place was PACKED). The atmosphere was actually pretty nice for a strip mall restaurant - low lights, candles on the tables, some modern music playing (although just loud enough to hear the music, not enough to distract). It is still basically one large room, and a few corners are a little too dark, but overall a really relaxing, modern decor. 

Happy hour specials are pretty decent and the 1/2 appetizers is a really nice deal as they have some good appetizers. Our server was awesome - friendly, always checking on us, and really one of the best we have had in awhile.

Main dishes were all very well presented, tasted great, and were perfectly sized portions.

We didn't expect much from a strip mall restaurant and were a little intimidated with how full and loud it was when we stopped by on a weekend night, but we will probably come back here again."}
{"text":"Whether you're at the Wexford or Lawrenceville location, you can't really go wrong with their food. While I've never been a fan of their beer selection or the preparation of their mixed drinks, I always enjoy my meal.

Big portions, and the kind of bar food I like prepared at a high level. 

The design of each location is interesting and I'm guessing they're trying to play off the \"dive\" bar name by being anything but.

Service is always friendly, but come for a good meal as I've yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"While they only have about a dozen drafts, the selection is diverse and well rounded. Food is on point and late kitchen service is a plus. Environment is just trendy enough without over doing it and also cozy."}
{"text":"Each time I've been, the food has been good, the beer specials are numerous, and the servers are friendly. It's a fun and comfortable place to watch a game, too!"}
{"text":"So disappointed last night! Went there for dinner with hubby while son seeing Hunger Games at the movies; we dine here often as it is close enough to NA High School that we can eat while waiting to pick up son from school activities. First time on a Friday night - won't go back; too many restaurants to choose from; server tried to make us move from out table after another server had told us to sit there - so disorganized - maybe they should consider a hostess on busy nights. Sad too as we loved the restaurant; I had even taken my lunch gals there numerous times for lunch as they had not heard of it. Owners, think about a hostess; being told we had to move from our table by our server; then treated like second-class citizens the rest of the night; NOT a good thing; I ended ordering a sandwich instead of an entree due to this situation - guess we'll go to Bonnie & Clyde's again instead next time - good luck!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go. Their food is all fantastic, unique and delicious appetizers and the have a great happy hour. I would say prices are the middle of the road. It's always freezing in there, as a heads up- but the food is worth it! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Date night dinner out was a fun trip to Dive in our part of town. Wanted to try this location since we enjoyed the other several months back.

A weeknight was not that busy so we had the table of our choice. The round table in the corner was a good spot. We could see the bar and enjoy the comfy space. 

The menu was interesting and the staff could make good suggestions of menu choices. 
We started with Southern Comfort as an app. Good flavor, but not amazing - the pulled pork & mac n cheese unique combo tasted good but was missing something. 

The drinks & draft list were great - our server could have known more but was honest about her lack of knowkedge & helped ask bar tender a question we had. 

The Arsenol Apple Ginger Cider was something new i tried and i loved it! 
Great food - see pics
Will be back again!!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches were excellent.  I had the PO Boy which I had them make into a wrap.  It was so good and I loved the Asian slaw. The drinks were so-so. Kind of bland. The place wasn't that busy and it took awhile to get our drinks. The waitress was not very professional. Had to ask for a menu. Next time we won't sit under an AC vent as we about froze with it blowing on us the whole time. I would have given it 5 stars but I will be returning."}
{"text":"I have been here for happy hour and for brunch. The food was excellent and the price was great. The loaded croquettes were fabulous. I enjoyed the donut holes and morning after special for brunch. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I often visit Dive Bar on a Sunday night after 8pm when the menu is 1/2 off. Do not be fooled by the name or the outside of the building! We thoroughly enjoy the atmosphere: the dimly light room, TVs to watch every game, the fireplace, and the occasional professional athlete or coach (Dumoulin and Sullivan!) that walks through the  door. The staff could not be more pleasant. Oftentimes, we have the same waiter due to our regularity and he acknowledges us as if he personally knows us. 

Dive Bar has some sort of food or drink special every day of the week. If it weren't for that, the food and drinks would be a bit pricey. However, all of the deals are great and if you enjoy certain foods, make sure you go on the appropriate day! Mondays - Wings, Tuesdays - Sandwiches, Wednesdays - Burgers, Thursdays - Wine, Fridays & Saturdays - Vodka, Sunday Nights - The Entire Menu! 

My husband and I often split an appetizer and  then each get our own meals. Combined, we have probably tried over half of the menu and there hasn't been an item we have disliked. From the juicy burgers and hearty sandwiches, to the crisp salads and plump wings, the food is fresh and delicious. One day, we plan on trying the brunch to see what they have to offer. 

I absolutely love this place.  The diversity of the crowd, friendliness of the staff, and the deliciousness of the food make this restaurant unique and worth checking out."}
{"text":"Went here after doing the zipline at north park on Mother's Day. Needless to say, I was starving, as was everyone else I was with. The place was absolutely deserted, and I have no idea why!!

I had nachos, they were awesome. Actually everyone was surprised with how good the food was, and the desserts OMG they were good. 

AND they have Old Chub, which is my favorite beer in life. #love"}
{"text":"I've been for lunch, following work and early evening. Crowd varies based on time and day. Good vibe. Places to gather with groups and friends without being anchored at a table. Good food and beer selections and great bar.  You can go casual to dressy. Prices are moderate perhaps $$-$$$
Definitely not a dive bar."}
{"text":"Love this place! Both locations are awesome, but I most recently visited Wexford. The atmosphere is on par with your typical pub, but the food is far better! The selection is great, and I like that they offer flavorful healthy options. The seared tuna bites and greek salad were perfect. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"The reason that I gave this such a stellar recommendation was because of the food only. I tend to think that the place in general was a tad under-built (ie more tables than bar. )

What I got the night that I was there with a bunch of friends was the following. 

Pierogi Quesadillas 
Buffalo Chicken Egg Rolls
Alabama Slammer (burger)

You really can't go wrong with any of these."}
{"text":"Dive Bar offers a relaxed, albeit a little noisy at times, atmosphere to enjoy a few cold pints and some delicious eats.  They also have plenty of TVs for sports events which was great.  

We tried their zucchini fries that came with marinara and were really blown away by how moist and flavorful their were with a light tempura like batter.  We asked for some horseradish sauce instead of the sweet marinara and that made all the difference.  

I also had some of their Jamaican jerk wings cooked well done with a side of garlic parm dipping sauce.  The wings were super crisp and filled with chicken meat.  My partner tried their mahi tacos with a side of perfectly steamed spinach and really enjoyed those as well.  

Our server was very good even though she seemed to have a ton of tables to wait on.  It helped that she had expediters to bring the food to the table."}
{"text":"This place is always delicious.  The brunch is awesome and they have Mimosas with options for juice. I asked for light orange juice and they added the perfect amount. The sweet potato tots are good but the dipping sauce was even better. They always have great specials and happy hours.  The burgers were perfect cooked to order and the staff was friendly"}
{"text":"While previous experience has been satisfactory, today's visit was terrible. Seven people in our party and four people had their order wrong or incomplete with mine being wrong twice (raw burger the 2nd time after wrong burger the 1st time). The 6th and final gaffe was our bill being wrong even after taking the burger off. Who in the world would think to serve french fries with a pb&j? It was supposed to be a banana, don't the cooks know the menu they made? Won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"If you don't want to talk to your dinner guests or hear for the next few days, this is your kind of place. The food is overpriced, tasteless and the service is poor. I see this place as a local pickup joint for the 50+ married crowd."}
{"text":"Great environment for drinks or dinner with friends! It's a refreshing change from all of the standard chain restaurants in the area. I've been disappointed with the food a few times over the years but overall, the food is great. Nothing beats the sweet potato tots!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the area. The food is fantastic, as is the beer selection! I suggest trying the PB n Chutney burger, as I have given it the title of 'Best Burger I've Ever Had'. Seriously. I bring all of my friends here to check this place out and they all have nothing but great things to say. It can get a little loud during dinner hours, but that shouldn't distract you from the delicious food and drinks! $5 burgers & chips and $2 off craft beers on Wednesdays = best deal in town. This is the place to be."}
{"text":"Living Social had a deal for Dive Bar & Grille and after looking over the menu online, I really wanted to try it.  So I treated a friend and we met one night for dinner.

When you first walk in, it's a bit odd....you don't know where to go.  When we walked in, there was no hostess to greet or seat us, which left us a bit confused.  But it wasn't crowded, so we just took a table.  We didn't wait very long and our waitress was very attentive; my glass was never empty and I only had to ask once for a refill.

For basically being a bar with tables, the menu is impressive.  We ordered some appetizers (fried pickles and buffalo chicken won tons).  The breading on the fried pickles was good and the portion was more than we expected.  The buffalo chicken won tons, however, were a bit salty and we only got three.  

My friend ordered a steak sandwich that she enjoyed very much.  I had the Incredible Hulk sandwich which I thought was a unique idea and it exceeded my expectations.  One thing we were both surprised by was the sweet potato tots.  Yes, not just your plain tater tots, we're talking sweet potato tots.  I was very excited to try them but ended up disappointed by the small portion.  

I'd say check out the menu online and if something sounds good to you, stop by and give it a try.  They also have a nice beer selection.  After reading other reviews, I would also recommend going during the week for a random night out to avoid a crowded Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"Ughh DIVE BAR.... I want to love you..  I love the atmosphere, the food, the drink selection, the happy hour specials.....everything except your service!!!!  I send my clients here for a great menu variety and cozy décor and I think its an excellent place for a quick lunch, business lunch, date night, happy hour group, family dinner....really anything.  But the service.  At both locations.... something needs to change or I feel the newest location in South Side will do a complete nose dive.

I stopped in today because I really enjoy the food here.  However, Ive stopped going to the Lawrenceville location after a few consistently poor experiences with the service.  This is the first time I've dined in at the Wexford location.  It was not busy although it was during the lunch hour with a lot of businesses around, maybe five other tables were occupied with parties of 2-4 people.  We sat ourselves and were approached for our drink order.  I noticed only one person was serving and also bartending.  Our drinks came out, but the diet coke was flat - tasted like sugar water.  The server walked past my dad and I a few more times even though our menus were closed, and finally took our order.  I ordered the turkey gouda melt in a wrap and my dad ordered the Korean beef salad. Both were soooooo delicious.

We waited almost 25 minutes in a dead restaurant for our 1 salad and 1 turkey wrap to come out to our table.  We ate quickly because at that  point we'd been there for nearly 45 minutes and needed to get back to work.  It took almost 10 more minutes for our check to get to our table and it sat there with the credit card for another 10 before I finally walked it up to the server/bartender washing glasses & watching the Pirates game on TV.  I noticed the table that had arrived shortly after us still did not have their food.

The server was friendly and apologetic when he realized he hadn't collected our check, and I could understand if this place had consistently great service, but it seems to be a common factor.  And that's a bummer because it really is a good little spot that I'd love to stop by more frequently during weekday lunchtime."}
{"text":"Go here quite often. Like the food and decent beer selection. However, today I stopped in to have lunch. The waitress got me a draft list, gave me a good menu and then never came back. Waited for a good 20mins watching her walk all around and take other orders and get other checks. Was not super busy. Finally had enough and decided to speak with the manager before I left. Told him about the poor service and stated I was upset. He said the waitress is new and learning. Did not seem to care one bit about the poor service that was given. Said I should not be upset. Not the kind of service I expected from this place. Highly disappointed and will not be returning. Do what I did and head to Wexford Pub, drinks are better and cheaper! Definitely needed one after that lol"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch today.  The only thing this place has going for it was the friendly staff.  It was very dirty...the ceiling fans were caked with dirt, lights burned out, the food took way too long to come, and there was a hair cooked into our food!  Gross.  The staff and manager were very apologetic, but the damage had been done.  We would not go here again."}
{"text":"Not a bad experience. Kids menu could be improved. The seating is a little tight. Otherwise, it's a nice place to come and dine to support local businesses."}
{"text":"I eat here regularly. It is family favorite. You get better service if you sit at the bar rather than at a table. Tuesday is 1/2 off sandwiches and Wednesday is 1/2  off basic burgers. If you like micro brews they always have many on tap."}
{"text":"We stopped here on Labor Day after a fun evening at Wildwood Highlands. This was just a short drive from there. The servers were really friendly & we were able to choose our own seats. We chose a super comfy booth. I didn't order a beer, but was impressed by their beer selection. We started off with an order of the fried pickles. They were good, but falling apart. It was clear they were made from scratch (which I always appreciate) & the flavors were really good, so I didn't mind that the breading was coming off. I went with the shrimp po' boy sandwich with french fries and Brendan ordered a burger and fries. We both really liked our meals. The fries were french cut & the po' boy was really tasty. The shrimp were really big & tasted very fresh. I did think the sandwich lacked something, like a better veggie mix, but it was still really good. We had a great meal and will consider returning again if we are in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is great. You've got to try the Knuckle Sandwich.

I've had a lot of the sliders and appetizers, and quite a few of the burgers and sandwiches, and I have yet to be dissatisfied. The daily lunch specials are a win. Even though it says \"with drink purchase,\" you don't have to buy a drink to get the special. Get a water and a special and you have a cheap lunch that beats fast food and many of the other options around the area.

Seating is not just at tables either. There are a few couches with tables to eat at as well. I took the family there for dinner one evening and we sat around a table on a couch by a fire. Such a cool atmosphere.

My favorite appetizers are the deep fried pickles and the buffalo calamari. Favorite sandwich would have to be the knuckle sandwich. Try the sweet potato tots for a change to your usual hum-drum sides."}
{"text":"I came in with a group of four on Saturday around 7:30. They were relatively busy, no line and they had one table open that could have sat six people. We were told it would be a 25 to 35 minute wait. I asked if we could sit at the open table and we were told we could not have the open table because we didn't have 6 people. I could maybe understand if there was a line or other people walking in that had a bigger group. However that was not the case. I will not be going back"}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and appetizers!  We order 4 or 5 appetizers and make a meal out if it.  Great service and waitstaff!"}
{"text":"I went to Dive Bar last night for dinner before a movie. I've been there once before for late night drinks, so I wanted to try their food before giving a review.

Walking in, you seat yourself and then get waited on. Service was quick and super friendly. It almost fell fake friendly but I will still take that any day over poor, unfriendly service.

The temperature inside was absolutely freezing. Having come from the frigid Temps outside my friend and I shivered through our meals. We asked if the heat could be turned up and we're told it already was, although they did try to turn it up some more.

The menu is varied with many options. I decided to try the grilled ceasar salad and added grilled portobello and shrimp for an upcharge. While they did not add on a LOT of mushrooms or shrimp, I thought their upcharge was super fair and I didn't feel slighted at all.  

My friend got a fry bowl and she said it was ok but couldn't really taste the different flavors. Too much going on in the bowl.

All-in-all it was an ok experience. I would never rush to go back. There was absolutely nothing different, unique, or remotely memorable about the place.  But if I was getting a pedicure next door and wanted a cocktail before or after, I MIGHT stop by.

5/5/17 - came here with a friend the other day for a burger. it was half priced burger night, and all I can say is, thank goodness because the burger was a huge disappointment. I got the Cali burger and requested medium well.  the burger was described as having fresh mozzarella, avocado  and sundried tomato aoli. it was so over cooked that it was crumbly, there were just 3 very small, over melted/rubbery blobs of cheese, avocado on the side, and so little sundried tomato aoli, it was lost. what bit I found had 0.0 flavor.

I would come back for the salad, but I mean, there's too many other places to go that I enjoy both the food and the atmosphere better."}
{"text":"Dive bar in Wexford is one of my favorite places for a casual night to grab a quick meal!  It really is not a \"dive\" but great atmosphere with Tv's, full bar, plenty of seating and an extra room you can reserve for parties!  Friends of mine held my house warming party here last year and it was a fabulous evening!  My sister and I frequent this place for 1/2 off burger night every Wednesday!  Just a heads up,  you do have to order a drink .. soft drink or alcoholic beverage to get the half off price!  They offer me a deals throughout the week including half off wings, sandwiches, burgers and entire menu!  Kids eat free every Thursday!  Stop by the dive bar for a nice night out to catch up with a friend or dinner with your other half!"}
{"text":"Nice local joint with good sandwiches and wings.   I like the tvs and atmosphere.  We have been a couple of times and have always enjoyed our food and drinks."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Happy Hour and was so glad I did.  Great prices on apps and drinks during happy hour but I would gladly come back and pay full price.  Fantastic service (I never waited to have my drink refilled), and the rueben rolls were incredible.  Lots of menu items look really good, can't wait to come back and try them!"}
{"text":"Honestly, do I even need to say it? The buffalo egg rolls? Why would you ever take those off the menu. I am distraught and can no longer come to your establishment."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. I hit up Dive Bar & Grille in Wexford a few weeks ago. They have 3 locations- Wexford, Lawrenceville, and South Side. Their menus are similar, but their Wexford location is my favorite. 

We started with the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp - they are glazed with Thai bbq sauce. They are delicious. 

For my entree. I ordered the Luau Chicken wrap with fries - it has bacon, pineapple salsa, chicken - what could be better? This is legit my favorite \"wrap\" in the city. 

My mom ordered the Grilled Bella - a large portabella mushroom drizzled in balsamic vinegar served on spinach with artichoke hearts & roasted red peppers. This was her first ordering it and she enjoyed it. 

Overall, Dive is anything, but a dive bar. It's a great place to bring friends and family. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. I mean, it has all the ingredients - good happy hour, big menu, adequate beer selection. What's not to like? Well, I've given it a few tries (and will give it a few more) but it just isn't registering for me as a place I want to come back to over and over again. 

First of all, the atmosphere is generic to the extreme. It's a bunch of tables spread over a concrete floor - no ambience, no warm and welcoming feeling. The few tv's scattered around are not making a difference in my opinion. It's just plain vanilla. The lack of any softscape inside makes the place incredibly loud, even when there aren't that many people inside. There's just nothing to absorb the sound so it is quite loud. Like a cavern. 

We always sit at the bar - its our preference pretty much any place we go. Service tends to be better at the bar in my experience. However, not so here. The times we've been here it seems like chaos at the bar. First of all, there are only about 15 stools at the bar so it shouldn't be overwhelming. A bar\"tender\" should be able to deal with that without issue. In our last two visits. it was hard to tell who was a bartender, where they went in between \"tending\" patrons, or who to ask for a refill. Last time, I counted there were 11 different people behind the small bar in a 15 minute period (not simultaneously). ELEVEN. Some were waitresses getting their own orders filled, some were kitchen staff (I think), some were restocking, and I have no idea who the others were. It was like a revolving door. I never did see the first bartender (or even the second one!) who got our drinks initially again. People came and went and while that in itself wasn't bad, not one of them seemed to pay much attention to the people actually sitting at the bar. No one stayed there long enough to establish any normalcy. I don't know about you, but I want a bar\"tender\". I want to know who's taking my drink order, who's checking on me to see if I want another, who's bringing my food out...I know, pretty radical concept.

The beer selection had at least 3 IPA's out of 11 drafts so I managed ok there. The happy hour menu is half off all drinks and apps which is good and there are some good things on the menu. Love the bacon wrapped shrimp. But avoid the reuben eggrolls. Those are belly busters and you will not like the after effects. Trust me.

I'll go again. Hopefully they'll get this bartending thing down eventually."}
{"text":"It is only Dive bar in name.  I found this place cia Yelp in order to meet a friend in town for the day.

They have a smaller tap selection than what I am compared to at my local watering holes.

They have a great whiskey selection.  I ordered Four Roses and Johnny Walker Blue.

Their food was on point.  I ordered their macaroni and cheese (with chorizo) topped with 2 eggs.   I added bacon and jalapenos to take it over the top.  This was the perfect Franken-food for me.

All and all the drink and food was great.  The bartender was awesome.  He kept our drinks full and made awesome recommendations.  Experiences like that make a place memorable.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I'd never been to Dive before, and was very happy with my meal there. I had a pretty unique item off the menu- a burger with peanut butter and pineapple if I recall correctly. Strange as this may seem, it was delicious- I would absolutely order it again if I didn't want to try other things on the menu! 

The staff was very accommodating to our large party of people and service was quick and friendly. Great atmosphere. Dim (but not too dim) lighting that sets a great mood. Comfortable seating and from what I saw, a great bar. 

Hope to eat at Dive again soon. It's definitely holding its own against the multitude of restaurants in Wexford."}
{"text":"My family (2 kids) visited here on a Monday night and I'm glad we did.  It was a great time to bring kids.  The place was relatively empty so my kids being loud wasn't an issue.  Not what I would call a \"little kids place\" (no kids menus, crayons, etc. for them while they waited for food).  This is an okay place for younger adults, but not little kids.

The food was great.  Bruschetta appetizer was awesome and we got burgers and my wife got a chimichanga.  Se LOVED it (didn't stop talking about it).  Service was great too and loved the variety of beer they had to offer.  We got there for happy hour which had some nice specials.  We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Probably should get 2.5 stars but I opted for three.  I liked a lot about this place and I disliked some things, mainly the slow service.  

I took a client to lunch here and it's a good thing we weren't limited on time because it took a heck of a long time to get our food.  We arrived a little before noon and while we were a group of six, we were the only people in the restaurant.  Probably 10 or so more people in small groups came in after us and they were served their food long before we were served ours.  It probably took about 45 minutes for us to get served which is not a good turnaround for a lunch crowd.  No reason that should happen especially given the 20 or so other open tables.  If that's how long it takes with 15 people in the restaurant, I can only wonder what its like when it's packed. 

Despite the slow service, I was pleasantly surprised by the food and the atmosphere.  I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and sweet potato tots.  I'm not sure I've had tater tots since high school.  The breaded buffalo chicken appeared to have been breaded with panko break crumbs and was browned and crisped perfectly and the tomatoes they served were fresh and ripe enough to have come from my own garden.  No soggy, gross breading on this baby.  The tater tots came with what I will describe as a brown sugar, cinnamon, butter dipping sauce that was so so good.  I felt like I was eating a dessert!  The menu is huge and they offer a really wide range of food including a salad that was called I hate vegetables or something similar and was essentially chicken fingers, bacon, cheese, ranch, onions and some other items in a bowl.  Heart attack waiting to happen.  

They have a big stone fireplace so it would be a great place to come in the winter for some wine and appetizers and just chill.  They also have a bar and some tvs and would be a bit more up scale place to catch a game."}
{"text":"My first time here. I had the pulled pork with sweet potato tots they were both excellent! They could have given me a few more tots, but that's not all bad because they more than made up for it with the size of the sandwich."}
{"text":"First time visit was on a Friday night and found one table open. Wide variety on the menu, so we had a hard time choosing. We ended up with nachos, chicken sliders and a burger- that I cannot remember the name of, but it was excellent. Topped with bacon, cheese, a fried egg and whole grain mustard, it was one of the best burgers I've had. Our server was very nice and attentive. Although it was quite loud inside, we thoroughly enjoyed our meal and will be back."}
{"text":"Wife and I have stopped a few times here especially for happy hour. This place has changed quite a bit since we first started coming and not for the better. To begin with, they have excluded more draft beers than ever from their home list charging full price instead. The same with the mixed drinks. I tried to order 3 different well drinks but was told ohhhh sorry not during happy. Now they have removed several food items from the hotel menu as well saying oh we were losing money. Ok, so the bottom line is, there are still several items left but nowhere near what it was. On top of that, when you sit at the bar, the air conditioning is so cold. Told the bar tender on several occasions there and he just laughed and said, yeah I know. I don't quite know how to even react to that but others at the bar were complaining to.
So we have found several other happy hours around that are better."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and every experience has been the exact same. That experience is that the food is always really good, but the service is always lacking. We went today for lunch and there was one person to run the bar and serve tables. I really think this place should have strictly waiters and waitresses for the tables, and leave the bartender at the bar.. if this place could get their service issues fixed it would be a solid 4 or 5 stars for me."}
{"text":"Average greasy food.  Service was less than stellar.  Took over 45 minutes just for appetizers!  Noise level it's excessively high."}
{"text":"Amazing food, good staff, and good atmosphere. I would eat there everyday of the week if I could!"}
{"text":"Great menu - lots of different menu ideas for the area! Love the Thai salad and homewrecker sandwich! Ruben rolls are awesome for happy hour! Happy hour is super busy so get there earlier or be prepared to wait a hot minute!!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. 

I started playing the jukebox for my daughter and I to listen to some of our favorite songs and they turned down the volume wayyyy down. I'm sorry, but Juicy by Biggie should NEVER prompt a volume reduction.  If you don't want people playing songs don't have a jukebox.  Lame.   Remove your jukebox or I'll sit in the parking lot and play terrible songs nonstop during happy hour.  This is a promise, jack."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night around 10 for a late night dinner. It was open seating and we grabbed a table near the door only to be pushed out by a group of old dudes trying to pick up a group of clearly married older women. Had to move tables but our server was really nice about it and gave us a round of drinks on the house. 

I got wings and a side salad. The salad was fresh and the Greek dressing was excellent! The wings were really good also. I got the spicy Thai chili. 

They have a lot on their menu and will definitely be back to try some other things!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place because it is so close to my house. However, it was beyond disappointing. While the items on the menu for Brunch were unique and sounded great, the service was horrendous. It was Sunday afternoon and we were one of five tables in the entire place. Our food took almost 45 minutes to come to our table and of the four dishes ordered, three were incorrect. How does a breakfast burrito not have eggs in it? (The menu clearly states that it includes eggs) The omelets were mostly filling and cheese, literally almost no egg. An egg white omelet came out with regular eggs and instead of tater tots as we ordered, everyone received hashbrowns. Since it took so long for our food to come out we opted to just eat what was given to us.
Seriously disappointing."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Sundays ago with my girlfriend for a late dinner.  We had been told by one of my coworkers that they had some great deals later on Sunday evening and after looking at the website I saw that they had half price food after 8 with a drink purchase.  So we decided to put off dinner for a bit and head there shortly after 8.  The inside of the place seems to be pretty nice for a place called Dive Bar.  It is fairly open with the bar being on one side of the restaurant and the dining room taking up the rest of the space with exposed brick walls and many different TV's.  If nothing else it feels like a comforting place.

My girlfriend and I decided to start off our dinner with some calamari and I also ordered a PBR pounder for $2.  Wow, talk about reliving some college days!  What is interesting about the calamari here is that they sort of treat it like wings and so when you order them you can also choose between dry rubs and sauces for dipping or tossing.  While we love calamari, this was an extra incentive for us to get it and we ordered ours with a five pepper blend rub and also hot garlic parm sauce for dipping. The calamari was cooked nicely and was not overly and I absolutely loved having something of my choosing to dip it in.  While I do not think that the hot garlic parm sauce was very spicy, it still tasted awesome and had a tiny bit of spice to it.  For my dinner entree I ended up going with the stacked mac which was their mac n cheese with buffalo chicken tenders on top.  Whenever my dish came out I have to admit that I was sort of disappointed in the chicken tenders as they were small, not spicy and almost non existent.  If I had paid the full $16 for it I would have been mad but at the half off $8 price, it was pretty reasonable.  The mac and cheese itself was pretty good though and I did enjoy that.  My girlfriend ended up getting the mahi sandwich as a wrap and she told me that she enjoyed it.

The bottom line for me is that I will definitely head back here in the future especially if it for a late Sunday night dinner.  The space is comfortable and the food is good enough that it could become a regular hangout for us."}
{"text":"Love going here and am there on a biweekly basis.  Food is very unique, I personally enjoy the selections of sandwiches and they have decent beers on tap.  Very reasonable priced as well if you go when there are specials (and they are always having specials).

Even if you don't like bars, this is a place where you can take your family and have a good meal with a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Dive is one of our favorite Friday night dinner spots.   I try to pick something new every time and I have not been disappointed.  It is also a great place for kids (ours are under 5) as there are oversized booths to accommodate the tikes."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff! Food has been amazing every time we've been there! Drinks are unmatched!...there strong and all well made and fair priced! They need more seating because we've had to wait however both times were Friday or Saturday evenings, it's expected. We will be going there many more times. Great place in the heart of Wexford."}
{"text":"Not a good place to take your kids! The spaghetti sauce is to spicy for your kids to eat. Also the grilled cheese was burnt. We had to go to a fast food restaurant after leaving this place to get our kids something to eat."}
{"text":"Not what I expected when I walked in. It's all open with high top tables. Most people were sitting at the bar. Our waiter was friendly.  I had a Thai chicken wrap. It was very tasty and not too much dressing. Came with a small salad which was fresh. It was the right amount of food. It's a good place to grab a bite to eat, not expensive, but decent food."}
{"text":"Great happy hour that lasts deep into the night.  Nice beer selection. Friendly staff, decent jukebox."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here when I was first getting ready to move to the area. I said I wanted to find a good wing place! We went on a Monday which was half off wing night so we got an order of 10. 5 Hot Garlic Parm and 5 Honey Sriracha. Both were great but that Hiney Sriracha was unreal. Plus the wings had that amazing crispy outer layer! Incredible! And for under $5 was a steal. We also ordered meals and I opted for the Professor because it 1) sounded tasty and 2) had a cool name. Don't judge me! It was a Panko Breaded Chicken Breast with Canadian Bacon, Swiss, Lettuce, Tomato and Thousand Island Dressing with a side of Sweet Potato Tater Tots and Brown Sugar/Cinnamon Butter all for $10. This thing was massive and while there was a lot of bread, you still got a lot of flavor out of it. The Tots and Butter were to die for!  I just wish the portion was a bit larger for these.  You want to get them! Trust me.  Their beer selection was small but very well done on the craft side.  The service was excellent. Very polite and attentive. We never had to ask for anything.  I can't wait to go back and try out more of the menu. The wings are a definite go-to along with the Sweet Potato Tots!"}
{"text":"Amazing Food, Great Atmosphere and Happy Hour Specials!  Staff is exteremely friendly, they do an admirable job handling the crowds."}
{"text":"It has been several months since I was last at Dive so I thought it was time for an update, particularly after the service experience I had last night which was awesome! My friend and I arrived during happy hour, which is 5-7 M-Th, and the specials I took note of were the $2 off craft drafts and the 1/2 off apps. It was pretty busy but we snagged a table and were brought menus within a minute or two of us sitting down. Our server, Kelly, was super friendly and on point throughout our time there. She also made sure, since it was about 6:40 when we arrived, that we got an appetizer in before happy hour. I had a Bell's Oberon and my friend had a Rogue double bock, both were good and our first drinks were $2 off each due to the happy hour special. For our appetizer, I went back to the same appetizer I frequently order because it's just my favorite-the buffalo chicken egg rolls. My previous review described these so I don't feel the need to go into detail, but they were quite tasty! For our meals, I chose the Mediterranean wrap (described as a balsamic glazed portabella cap rolled with feta , artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, roasted red peppers, and mixed field greens, drizzled with greek vinagrette). This is a veggie friendly meal, however, I chose to add chicken to it, which was a $2 upcharge. I chose sweet potato tots as my side because the cinnamon sugar butter is freaking insanely addicting and fabulously delicious! While the flavors were quite good and the wrap was very tasty, it was quite messy and the tortilla did not hold all of the ingredients together properly. It was very difficult to pick up and eat so I knife-and-forked it. They should have used a thicker tortilla in my opinion, but again, that is a minor complaint as the actual taste was excellent. Also my portion of tots was nearly microscopic, however, I was so full from this wrap that I didn't mind. Plus, I look at the tots more as a spoon for the cinnamon sugar butter anyways :) My friend ordered the black and bleu burger (described as seasoned with blackened spice, topped with bacon, buffalo sauce, and blue cheese crumbles) with sweet potato tots as well. While I didn't sample the burger, he left his plate clean and said it was a \"really good burger\". Since my last review, I have sampled quite a few items other than what I tried last night and I have been happy with everything I have ordered. Other recommendations that I have enjoyed include: the thai chicken wrap (which held together better than the med. wrap), the salmon blt and then some  (I had this as a sandwich instead of a wrap, which you can do for any wrap and vice versa on sandwiches), and the  turkey gouda melt (this is STILL one of the best turkey sandwiches I have had in the Pittsburgh area-and the addition of the mushrooms on it is a perfect combination!) Our bill for 3 beers, an app, and two sandwiches/burgers came to $40.00-pretty good deal in my book! If you're ever in the Wexford area, I'd say this is one of the better non-chain establishments out that way and I'd recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"The food was really good. We had the mahi tacos and a salad and both were very good. Portions were huge. Service was a bit slow and not super friendly but they were very busy for a Saturday afternoon. 
The biggest issue was the extremely drunk couple sitting at the bar that was fighting and manhandling each other for a good half an hour. There were families here trying to have dinner and children and this couple was ridiculous! I was appalled that no one did anything and that they continued to serve them, as evidenced by the two beers that they were too drunk to finish. They were finally asked to leave when they passed out at the bar and then the ensuing drama when the guy abandoned the girl there. Absolutely ridiculous and very disturbing. It's a shame because the food really was good but I have a hard time going anywhere that allows the patrons to get that insanely out of control on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"My son and I were sick within 2 hours of eating here.  Service was to-do.  Nothing special here."}
{"text":"Went with a big group for Sunday brunch and everything that was ordered was really good and customer service was really polite. Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Had a good experience at the Wexford location.  We both ordered burgers that were tasty with a good bun and the fries were top notch.  Friendly and attentive servers as well.   The menu selection is nice with lots of sandwiches, wraps, and salads.  The beer selection is decent as well.  Overall, good experience and we'll go back!"}
{"text":"I love this place every time I go! Usually it's on a Tuesday or Wednesday for $5 sandwiches. I always get chicken because I can't eat red meat, and it's always a big juice piece of meat. Buffalo bleu is my favorite. Only reason for the 4 star rating is because the food took about 25 mins and we were seated right next to the kitchen. Cute waiter, good atmosphere, delicious food. Everything that came out of the kitchen door I wanted to snatch up for myself LOL"}
{"text":"So disappointed! This is our standard brunch spot with friends and it's always been great until this visit. Portions were very small, most of our orders were incorrect and the quality of ingredients has gone way down. This place used to be great, not sure what's happened."}
{"text":"Like all the 'dive bars' and good Bartenders and servers and selection of beer.  However, I've never been a huge fan of bars in Malls.  Instantly minus one star.  They have excellent bar food and good beers on tap at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, I really, really did. However, it just fell a little short overall. 

I came in here on a Sunday evening for dinner (this was prior to their Happy Hour). The place was near empty. My boyfriend and I picked a table and we were soon handed menus. We decided to pass on appetizers, but did order drinks. My boyfriend got a Corona and I ordered the Berry Sangria. There appeared to be 3 waiters tending to diners, one we were told was training. When our drinks were brought to the table, it was delivered by a waitress that (out of the 3) hadn't come to our table before. She set my drink down and said, here's you Sucker Punch.\" (Sucker Punch is a name of another mix drink.) I kindly explained that I didn't order that drink. She took it away and wanted me to tell her who \"screwed up\" my order. I thought that was a tad unprofessional. 

Anyway, soon after the drink mix up our food was delivered. I got the Luau chicken on sourdough, instead of a wrap as it's listed in the menu. It was good. It wasn't spectacular or anything, but it was good. 

After we got the check, we had to wave down a waiter to take our payment. Two of them stood around a table chatting while cleaning it. In a practically empty restaurant, I shouldn't have to wait almost 5 minutes to get the attention of a waiter. 

Also during my visit there was another somewhat perturbed diner that got up out of her seat and went to tell the bartender something. She appeared quite upset with something. So that was a bit of a scene. 

All in all, this place was just ok. It wasn't great. I will add that I do want to go back. They appeared to have quite the appetizer menu. And during Happy Hour, appetizers sound good!"}
{"text":"While the extensive menu of food & drinks is fantastic, the service and overall vibe of Dive is sub-par.  Of the handful of times I've been there, my order (or someone else's order in the group) was wrong or totally forgotten.  They are frequently understaffed for a restaurant's busiest times, and those who ARE staffed are mediocre at best.  The couch waiting area in the back corner is always dirty; empty glasses, crumbs, spills, grease, and used napkins are frequently left there.  

That being said, their menu is great - all the food has a modern twist for bar food, and all the drinks are tasty and off-the-beaten-path.  The beer selection is definitely not typical, and the mixed drinks are unique as well.  I will go back, but ONLY for the food and drinks; not for the atmosphere itself."}
{"text":"We had my birthday party here last year year, and it was great. We were able to reserve a back section that easily held 25-30 people, and we had a server all night that made sure everyone had a drink in hand. Great atmosphere - we had people in our group ranging from 25-65, and everyone had a good time; would definitely recommend. I also ate there a different time and the food is good - especially the sweet potato tots."}
{"text":"The fry bowl is where it's at. Sad to see they took away the custom bowls,  but the remaining pre-designed ones are still really good. Nice selection of beer and drinks. Great place to eat and talk, or watch the game!"}
{"text":"There are many things I really like about Dive Bar: very tasty food, friendly & welcoming staff, great happy hour specials, terrific beer selections & it's very casual - shorts & t's in summer are the norm. 

Yum on the Sweet Chili Bacon Wrapped Shrimp, the Kahlua Pork Sliders and the Calamari! Less than excited by the 2 bites I took of the Reuben egg rolls. There are plenty of other goodies on their menu so I'm not terribly concerned. 

Ok now for the rest...who brings screaming kids into a bar? Yes, it's always a bad idea and there are too many of them in here. Get a sitter! 

There is no soft scape in here to dampen noise. Just brick walks & concrete floors, bar stools, tables & chairs. You hear every scrape, every loud conversation & every screaming kid. It's noisy. 

Also the staff seems to be constantly bustling around, especially behind the bar to the point that you don't know who is waiting on you. It's confusing at best. They are all super nice but can we please have a designated bartender? 

I really like the food and the beer here. I just have some minor issues."}
{"text":"First time coming here and was not disappointed! Food was good as well as the service. The waiter was very personable and made sure we were satisfied. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch during work and I was so very surprised at this menu; and now that I've tasted the food...can't wait for my return visit.  VERY impressive.
Hitting all points here for me: Decor. Atmosphere. Staff. Food. Wouldn't change a single thing.
From the fresh ingredients to the layers of texture and flavor; THIS  is the place I'm telling everyone about here forward. I don't think there is anything on the menu that you could go wrong with. 
TIP: The waitress told us about their Sunday brunch, sounds amazing!!"}
{"text":"I have to say I didn't know what to expect after reading  reviews. It was delicious service was great... what more can you ask for!!"}
{"text":"Good intentions, but needs some help.... Went for the first time last night, sat at the bar, my lemontini was pretty good but the glass needed shined and just didn't seem very clean.  We had buffalo egg rolls as an app, which was the best thing of the night.  I had the chicken chimichanga meal, the presentation was pretty awesome but the inside wasn't very warm, kinda freaked me out a little bit.  The chicken didn't really taste like chicken, more like turkey, it was weird.... The service was not bad but not very good.... I was only going to put two stars but the place does have good intentions, just needs a little help and it would be a bomb place !!!"}
{"text":"We went in on a early Friday night to avoid the crowds.  Too bad the place was already packed.  Even though there is no official host desk, one of the servers greeted us right away and put our name on the wait list.  And after about 20 minutes, we got a table.

Our server was especially helpful and perky.  She helped me pick a martini and helped us pick our entrees.  Since it was happy hour, we loaded up with appetizers.  We loved the carnitas egg roll, pulled pork with corn, pico, black beans and pepper jack.  Very good.  Next came the sweet chili bacon wrapped shrimp.  I thought some flavor was missing here, but could not identify the problem with them.  BJ got \"Everybody Loves Meatloaf\" sliders.  They were served with delicious potato pancakes and onion straws.  I also got a side salad.  It was nice sized, but once again, something seemed to be missing.

Overall, we enjoyed our visit here.  Service was fantastic and it's got a fun vibe.  The food was not fantastic, but we still enjoyed their different offerings."}
{"text":"Food was AMAZING! So unexpected! We got a variety of food and EVERYTHING WAS GREAT! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Took my teenage son to Dive Bar for lunch.  We were greeted as soon as we walked in and given superior service and attention from the bar tender and a server.  

The boy had the burger sliders and Reuben rolls while I had their version of the Cuban called the Castro, which is served with fresh cut fries.  

All good and all eaten.

2nd time there for me and there will be more."}
{"text":"When I want a local (non-chain) restaurant in the North Hills, this is a go-to. Food and drinks are consistently great. I usually order several appetizers and share them with friends. $5 mojitos on Thursdays are a big draw for me! I love the late night deal on appetizers, too! The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the size - it's a little on the small size, so it gets packed and very loud on weekends, which makes it hard to have conversations. When it's packed, there isn't an area to wait inside the door - tables start right when you walk in, and there's no host stand, so it can be a little confusing getting on the waitlist and knowing what to do."}
{"text":"Happy hour specials (1/2 price apps, $4 house wines, $2 off craft drafts) were pretty good. We had the wings and bbq sliders - I'd order the sliders again but not the wings.  Dinner (I had the Pittsburgh cheesesteak and husband had the Mahi tacos) was just okay. Bottom line - I'd come for happy hour again but probably wouldn't stay for dinner."}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere! Dive Bar is one of my go-to dinner spots in the area. The prices are reasonable, especially during happy hour! The drink list is quite impressive and their beer selection is not too shabby. They just added lights, so it is much brighter at night."}
{"text":"This place is a gem in the rough given it is located at a strip mall.   They have different daily specials and I recommend Wednesday's for $5 burgers.  The burgers are very filling with all different crazy topics and meat options. 

 The entire staff is fantastic and knowledgeable.   They also have a large selection of local beers as well as mixed drinks.  You also get in a very nice crowd, not a bunch of rude drunk load mouth idiots."}
{"text":"We've been here twice in the last month and both times, all the food has been phenomenal. My boyfriend got the buffalo chicken sandwich once and the Knuckle Sandwich the next time and they were both awesome. I got the chicken nachos appetizer as a meal (the beer cheese ROCKS and it's on quite a few of their menu items) last time and the po'boy with crab cakes (instead of shrimp) this time. It was out of this world, just as good as an authentic one from New Orleans. The fries are great, and I got sweet potato tots this time-- SO good. They come with apple butter that's delicious too; just know it really is cooked down apples mixed with butter, so you probably don't wanna eat too much of it, as good as it is. We also got the seared tuna appetizer last time and agreed that it's not the first place you'd think to eat basically raw fish at, but it was well executed and very tasty. We got the spinach and artichoke dip this time. It needed some salt and there was a glob of cream cheese that wasn't mixed in, but it still tasted good and you get tortilla chips, carrots, and celery to dip. Haven't gotten to drink there yet, but they're always changing what's on tap and the selection looked good. You seat yourself here, and we sat down at 6:00 and watched 4 or 5 groups after us have to stand and wait for an open table. So probably come a little bit earlier than you think you need to. Overall, this place is GREAT! Really diverse menu with delicious food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Just left this place. Fish and Chips were just all grease. My wife's Caesar was dry with croutons that were like dust.
Why do bars with Pittsburgh sports teams on have music blaring ???  Ok we can't hear the commentary but we can't hear the people at our own table either. Do any of these bars ask their customers what they think??  Badly in need of customer service advice."}
{"text":"I'm going to make it simple. Fantastic! The Wednesday specials are outstanding! Had a $37 bill for 4 beers, an appetizer, a burger, and a sandwich. This food is incredible."}
{"text":"This is more a 3.5 stars.  My first time here was about 2 years ago for a friend's bday.  She reserved the lounge area in the back.  My initial thought was this is a nice surprise (not expecting it from the look of the outside and being located at a strip mall). After that, we came often for happy hour or late night eats.  They have different daily specials and we usually come for $5 burgers on wednesdays.  The burgers are very filling but average/what you'd expect from the menu description.

The menu has some interesting dishes.  The grilled bella is a good small plate dish.  The caprese wrap is inconsistent.  I've had it better tasting than other times.  I have yet to try a large plate dish.

They have a good and extensive drink list and there's a lot of beers to try that's not found at other bars in town.  When we went last night, they were offering their seasonal drinks like the pumpkin martini that my friend had (it smelled and tasted delicious!).  Hubby and other friend had pumking with the cinnamon sugar rim. Since it has a lot of alcohol content and so easy to drink, they will come in a short glass.  They also tried other seasonal ipas, which they both liked.  They have good martinis as well (and only $5 during happy hr)

I'd say food is ok (sometimes inconsistent), drinks are the star at this place, service is also inconsistent with some servers being better than others. The women's bathroom needs some TLC. I don't think anyone watches it because sometimes there are no toilet paper or paper towels, and the soap dispensers were broken last night, which made me question if the servers went to the bathroom and hopefully had their own hand sanitizers."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today with a group of coworkers during our lunch break. We arrived at around 12:15, and there were only two other groups of people occupying tables at the time. The atmosphere is nice - if you're expecting Dive to look like an actual \"dive bar,\" then you'll be surprised. The name is a little misleading as it's actually a much classier restaurant than a dive bar. Dive boasts an extensive menu with many options, generally in the American food realm. I think as a whole we were a little surprised at how long it took for our food to come out. We did have a party of 7, and I completely understand the difficulty in getting that many meals to come out at the same time. But considering the fact that there were only about 10 other customers in the restaurant, we were dissatisfied with our 30 minute wait time for our food.

I had the French dip for lunch, which was just fine. I wasn't overwhelmed and I wasn't underwhelmed. The au jus sauce was probably the best part of the meal. I wish there had been a few more grilled onions on the sandwich, because I think that would have added a little more texture and flavor. One of my coworkers raved about the risotto, so I think that would be worth a try at a later date. Overall, my experience at Dive was not too memorable and I don't think I will be rushing back."}
{"text":"Not yo' stereotypical dive bar with a healthy craft draft list and some unexpected twists on burgers, sammies, and appetizers. The sweet potato tots will satisfy even the sweetest of tooths especially with the cinnamon + brown sugar butter dip that comes with. Surprisingly addictive. Props to the service on a very busy Pens night playoff win!"}
