{"text":"Honestly, best special fried rice I have tasted in a long time. Second time ordering and getting sesame chicken and the mixed vegetable soup for two. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Food is terrible.   Chicken was definitely frozen and just microwaved.   Lo mein is a 4 out of 10.   Will never order from here again."}
{"text":"After trying many local Chinese restaurants, this has been the one we've gone back to the most. The portions are wonderful, and they're always extremely quick while still maintaining a quality level of food. The fried rice leaves a little to be desired as it's very plain and not what we are used to from NY or AZ, but otherwise the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"I tried the General chicken and it is now my favorite item on the menu! I like to order it extra crispy with light sauce. Majority of my visits here are for the fried chicken and fried rice. Yum, Only reason why I give them 4 Stars is because the white rice could be better."}
{"text":"I ordered from Fortune Cookie II while I was in town on business.  I had th e Crispy Scallops. It was delivered quickly and as exactly as ordered. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Fast delivery,  good food.. I live in a new housing development clarabella they deliver to me with no problem even though my address isn't in gps"}
{"text":"I eat here a couple of times a month. Take out is fast and good size portion. The food is cooked when ordered so it is fresh and hot. Scallops have sand so I avoid anything with them. Everything else is recommended."}
{"text":"This was the best experience I have had with Chinese food restaurants in Charlotte.  The initial call to place the order was effortless and the person answering was very courteous, very familiar with the menu and answered my questions.  The food was delivered hot, fresh and in less time then stated. The vegetable fried rice was delicious--had the right amount of vegetables, very little oil and nice variety of vegetables.  I had the firecracker shrimp and it was delicious.  Very flavorful and complimented the plain fried rice nicely."}
{"text":"I went here hoping to find General Tso's tofu, but they do not offer that.  I ordered the Ma Po Tofu and it was just OK.  To be fair I have never had this dish before (from any Chinese restaurant), so I really didn't know what to expect.  The spicy brown sauce was good, but the tofu was incredibly soft, and crumbly which I did not care for (though this may just be characteristic of the dish itself).  The dish tasted good, it just wasn't for me.  The vegetable spring rolls were small, but very tasty!  The service was good/fast, and they are friendly as well.  I will likely order from here again, but definitely try something different!"}
{"text":"Do not go here.   Mom tried the beef with broccoli and the beef was suspect.  Bad consistency.   I'm surprised this place can stay in business."}
{"text":"Better than your normal Chinese food and really great prices! I am definitely going to go back."}
{"text":"Food tasted great but one of the pieces of chicken had a bite taken out of it so... 4 stars"}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food experience I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. This restaurant ought to be titled \"Fortune Cookie - The Deuce\" because the quality of the food, atmosphere, and service belong in a dimly lit bathroom stall. 

The server made it to the table one time to take our order, I was out of water through half of my meal. The food was bland, chicken full of cartilage, and nauseating. Asked for my chicken spicy, yet cannot taste any flavor whatsoever. 

No one should ever go here... like ever again. Ever."}
{"text":"My spicy tangerine beef was raw.  I can feel myself getting sick."}
{"text":"Food was great!! Service fast and friendly. I eat here often. It's about a 7 or 8 mile drive but I'm willing make it whenever I want chinese food.   And by the way, they have some of the best iced tea in town"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese food place in my area. They are reasonably priced and they have the best fried rice (totally rhymed by accident. The best part it that if you live in the Ayrsley/Whitehall area they deliver!!! You have to spend at least $15, but the are very fast!"}
{"text":"Chinese food on a Sunday afternoon...Yes please! 

Fortune Cookie II left a menu on my door a couple of weeks ago and my boyfriend and I decided to give them a try. After several unsuccessful attempts to find good Chinese food that would deliver in my area, I kept my fingers crossed that this place would be a winner...and lucky for me it was awesome! 

The staff was amazing when I called they confirmed my address and then asked for my order...I asked what she suggested if I wanted something spicy and she gave me several options which was very helpful. I was finally ready and ordered an appetizer of Crab Rangoon, Honey Chicken and the Firecracker shrimp. 

They quoted me 30 minutes and thanked me for my order...and true to the time promised our food arrived in 30 minutes. And the delivery driver was such a sweetheart! He greeted me with a smile and thanked me for the order three times! Now that's what I call excellent customer service! 

The Crab Rangoon appetizer was delicious! Very crispy on the outside and the filling of cream cheese, and crab meat was great. The sweet and sour sauce was a perfect compliment with each bite! They were an excellent way to start the meal. 

I had the Firecracker shrimp with fried rice and it was very good. The shrimp was prepared in a sweet yet spicy sauce with diced onions. I loved the flavors in this dish! Mixed with the fried rice, every bite was simply delectable! 

The boyfriend had the honey chicken with steamed rice, it smelled delicious! I didn't try any but he said it was delicious. With the perfect amount of flavor and sweetness. And based on the fact that he finished all of it I'm going to say he would definitely recommend it and order it again. 

Overall I was super pleased with the meal! And after so many unsuccessful attempts it's nice to finally having a \"go to\" place for quick Chinese delivery. They now have two new customers!"}
{"text":"I am going to drop some 5 star love on this spot. If you look from the outside, it looks shady, or even unattractive. Once you give it a chance though, you find out that the food tastes great, and the door traffic is non-stop, so there must be a reason for that, right? Plenty of shrimp in the fried rice too. No complaints, only compliments."}
{"text":"Ridiculously fresh and good food! I had the house special rice, steamed dumplings, crab rangoon and egg rolls (2 people). I will definitely eat here again. The shrimp sauce was delicious too!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have lived down in the Ayrsley area for two years now, and Fortune Cookie II has definitely been our go-to fix for almost the entire time. We tried two other places, and they just didn't match up.

The value you get here is unreal. Most of the combo meals are around $5.75 and come with fried or white rice & an egg roll or crab Rangoon. The best part, aside from the quality, is that you can usually make two meals out of it!

Their egg-drop soup is delicious, so we always order that so split and start with. Their crab rangoon are also a good starter, as are their coconut shrimp! For main courses, our favorites are the Broccoli Chicken, Hunan Chicken, Chicken lo mein, or the scallion chicken (add broccoli). You seriously can't go wrong. We tend to get things with the steamed chicken, but the fried chicken with the scallion is delicious. 

You can't go wrong here. The service is extremely fast. We usually order on the way and it's done by the time we get there!"}
{"text":"Great food, fast and friendly service. Perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Arsley!  The food is pretty good and pretty cheap!"}
{"text":"I had Fortune Cookie II's sesame chicken and egg roll lunch combination today.  Portions were rather large (enough for a second lunch, which is rare for me!) and I enjoyed the food.  The service was also excellent.

I squeezed my order in just before the lunch rush; it took them ten minutes to prepare my food, which I feel is reasonable.  Not sure how that interval would increment once 12 o'clock rolls around.

Not the best Chinese in Charlotte, but certainly better than most.  Three stars since the price was a bit steep for take-out."}
{"text":"I ordered this for delivery when I was staying overnight at the Comfort Inn. The food was delivered very hot and in less than 15 minutes. The spring rolls weren't very good and had meat in them which I wasn't expecting. The Hunan chicken was good, pretty spicy, and came with rice. The rice was pretty bland, but nonetheless on par with other similar restaurants."}
{"text":"Had a delivery order here tonight. The food was ready good. I had shrimp egg foo young with a side of house special fried rice. My girlfriend had pepper steak. I like the fact there are veggies in my rice. Lots of bean sprouts and eggs ( which I love). My order came to the house fast. The only down side was the gravy it was watery and salty. This will be my go to spot for Chinese take out."}
{"text":"Food was fine but customer service is rude as hell!  I placed an order for delivery and when I called, she specifically told me 20-30min which was fine but my food was delivered 1 hr later. A call informing me that the delivery was going to be delay would of been nice. Also the Asian guy who drives the dark Honda suv was so rude. After arriving late, while handing my food over he ask me if I was going to tip him  before I even received my change back which I thought was very inconsiderate and rude especially since he arrived late. Although I tip him, I was very upset!"}
{"text":"I hate to do this but I was looking for a new place for my family's weekly outing and the food is slaty the fried rice was bad half was white the other has some soy sauce, the egg roll was the size of my pinkie lol I couldn't believer it! The prices where great the staff was also so very nice but we will not be returning"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Chinese so I ordered from here and ordered shrimp and broccoli with 6 piece chicken wings. I requested steamed rice. I have no idea who was in the kitchen . The chicken wings were alright however the shrimp and broccoli( yuuck!). It was not seasoned at all! The rice was not steamed and was tainted with soy sauce of some sort. The shrimp was small and the broccoli was huge. I gave this two stars for the order being correct and ready within the time frame I was told. The food however was not up to par at all."}
{"text":"This place is my absolute favorite for Chinese food.  I have not been disappointed in any dish I have ordered.  My favorite appetizer is the Crab Rangoons and the Teriyaki Chicken sticks."}
{"text":"Called in a takeout order and it was ready within a reasonable amount of time. Overall, decent place to get cheap Chinese food. I went with the Szechuan Chicken, fried rice and a spring roll plus a ton of duck sauce. Downside: the fortunes in the fortune cookies were boring."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best chinese restaurants i've ever eaten from!...Well, I guess that depends on what you usually order. I recently moved down here from Philly and I have to say the minimum for delivery is quite high at Fortune Cookie. When I called them, they told me that the minimum to order is 12 dollars.....I guess it's not that bad, but not when you're \"almost broke\" and just want something quick to eat.

I ordered Chicken Chow Mein (which was very delicious), Egg Drop Soup & Singapore Mai Fun (Which has curry in it....I usually get Shrimp Mai fun (doesn't have any curry), so this was my first time trying it with the curry)....which was good....and the Spring Rolls were excellent!...(light, not too crispy and the cabbage wasn't all hard and sh*t) They're very organized when it comes to delivering your food, it looked so nice and neat...they didn't just slam your food on a styrofoam take out thingy and throw in a fork....they wrapped the forks in napkins and actually the plastic takeout thingy they put my Chow Mein in was quite stylish....made me feel like I got \"quality food\".

Overall, good food...and they do deliver on Tyvola!....and they accept debit over the phone :-)...oh yeah, and the delivery guy had cool hair.

Hope this helped!"}
{"text":"This place was not bad. The quality and price of the food is about the same as others. We dined in and the first thing I noticed was how clean and simple it was. As for the food, I don't think there's much to brag about but it's decent enough to get a quick meal or get some to-go. 

Also, the crab rangoons had very little stuffing compared to others but my sesame chicken and rice was okay."}
{"text":"I've eaten from coast to coast and Fortune Cookie II is the best Chinese food I've had. I now reside in California but whenever I come back to the east coast, I make it a must to visit this place at least once. 

I've ordered the crab Rangoon, shrimp fried rice, cashew nut chicken, shrimp egg foo young and several other dishes and they're always consistent in preparation and delicious. 

The food is brought out in a timely manner and is priced well. 

The staff is always friendly and attentive.  

This is definitely my go to spot for Chinese food in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love Chinese food and this is one of my favorites spots in Charlotte.
They have the best fried rangoon and the fried rice is delicious!
I always get the shrimp and beef fried rice and an order of crab rangoons. 
I normally order my food to go and they are pretty efficient, never had to wait more than 10 minutes for my order.
They also have great chicken wings, so crispy and the seasoning is very unique.
Their price is pretty fair and the staff friendly.
I've never had problems with my orders and Ive been going to this place regularly for almost 3 years.
One last thing, if you do not like onions ask them to not add to your fried rice, because they add a lot of onions."}
{"text":"I really have only eaten the steamed veggies and chicken from here so I cant give a totally detailed review, but this place is close, seems clean (always get take out) and the staff is nice and chatty. The brown sauces that comes with the steamers is good and garlicky and not just thick and viscous like some places. I would recommend getting a steamer if you want something light and you can certainly share. It is a huge portion! Would be a good meal in the beginning of the New Year when you think you want to loose weight for your resolution. ;)"}
{"text":"Chicken super dry. Sweet & sour sauce tasted way too sour. Rice had no flavor, nothing had flavor. Entire dinner tasted like soap. Definitely not the best, won't be going here for awhile"}
{"text":"Well they deliver to Berewick, which is a plus. I'll start with the pros
Yummy fried chicken wings, pork fried rice, and wonton soup

Cons
the chicken in the chicken and broccoli was too salty, so much so I couldn't even eat it.

I have to rate a 4 bc the pros outweigh the cons but when I order Chinese I typically only get chicken and broccoli, so not being able to order my favorite dish has me bummed. But I will order their specials with chicken wings from this place."}
{"text":"The food is good and cheap. Perfect for me. But they really need to work on whoever that young girl is that answers the phone. Her attitude is horrible!!! I think it's the manager's daughter. She interrupts you and is very rude. It's kind of ridiculous. Not a fan of the customer service."}
{"text":"Decent food. There's no wow factor but, hell its Chinese food. Don't like the dining area it just looks cheAp and annoying but I will order take out for sure and have been doing so for 6 years when I'm on this side of town"}
{"text":"I'm being serious when I give this restaurant a 5 star!! I tried a couple of Chinese takeout places in Charlotte and Fortune Cookie is by far my favorite! For the value, you can't beat it. My husband and I love ordering it on Sundays and being lazy. Our go to is egg drop soup (one of the best I've ever had), Hunan chicken meal (chicken, baby corn, water chestnuts, peppers, broccoli and mushrooms in a spicy sauce) and the chicken and broccoli meal. 

The meals are $5.95-7.95 depending on what you get and they come with fried rice and an egg roll. The meals are huge!! You will easily have leftovers. We always say we want to split a meal, but let's be honest, that never happens."}
{"text":"Fast, inexpensive, and pretty good quality take out food. Plus the employees are very nice and ensure they know exactly what you would like to order. I will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"Horrible Chinese food. I've eaten here 3x thinking the food was going to be better the next time because I ordered the wrong food. Wrong expectations each time. The hot and sour soup is soooo oily and just grease. The lo mein is not even fried when it needs to be and I've had a lot of takeout in my lifetime. While the Lo mein doesn't taste fried, it's overly greasy. It's like they just boiled some noodles and poured half a cup of vegetable oil on it. That's literally what it tastes like. Then I got the sesame tofu the other day thinking they couldn't possibly ruin tofu. I mean I just wanted some steamed tofu with sesame sauce and not only was the tofu not steamed but also deep fried to the point of being hard and inedible and instead of seasoning they just dumped another half a cup of grease on the tofu. You would think that with that much oil anything can taste good but you will be surprised at this place. In addition not only do they not fry the rice or put any eggs to fry it with, the rice just tastes like day old rice with leftover soy sauce all over it. Very disgusting food that will make you sick. I know it's takeout but at least make some effort to make the food edible. I can taste the hate of their jobs in the food. No way to run a business"}
{"text":"Love them! The garlic chicken with white rice is to die for, they  could have better customer service but hey their Chinese so you can't expect the best. But I will never stop going !! 5 stars for me!!!!, but other than that great food"}
{"text":"Terrible, awful, no good, very bad food. My husband and I picked up the general chicken and cashew chicken two nights ago. It was borderline inedible. The rice was the only decent part. The eggrolls were complete mush on the inside like they had been sitting out under a heat lamp for days. To top it off, massive stomach pains followed overnight and lets just say Imodium was my best friend yesterday. We do not recommend this place. Now I know why the food was so cheap. By the way it's two days later and I still feel like I have a brick in my stomach."}
{"text":"Was visiting my sister in law in Charlotte and we ordered the food it was delicious and a very affordable best chinese I have had in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Great service...  Got dinner to go...  General Tso chicken,  fried rice, and egg rolls...  A can't miss favorite....."}
{"text":"Good food was hot and crispy delivery was fast ! Love it and I'm not really into Chinese delivery"}
{"text":"RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!   Placed order online and asked in the special instructions for extra soy sauce.  Went to pick up and they only gave me one pack.  I called the restaurant to complain, the guy who answered the phone was very rude.  He said, \"That is not my problem.\"  He told me to come back and get more.  I told him I used my entire lunch break to go pick it up and that I can't come back.  He continued to argue with me and refused to correct the problem, didn't even say that he was sorry. I will never ever eat there again due to the nasty employee that answered the phone!  I have never been talked to by any establishment.  I will be disputing this transaction on my credit card."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I have had in a long time.  Everything tasted so good.  I ordered wonton soup and a beef n broccoli combo. I will order from this place again.  Quick service and it arrived hot."}
{"text":"Nice place on the inside and run very well. I ordered takeout for lunch and it was ready right when I arrived. Always a plus! Thing to remember: they only take cash for orders $5 and under.

I ordered the chicken & broccoli lunch special that comes with an egg roll (or crab rangoon - your choice) and choice of plain white or plain fried rice. I chose the fried rice and my gripe is that the fried rice just seemed like lightly colored white rice. In my experience, fried rice usually has egg, onions, peas, and carrots. This has none of that. Very bland and verrrrry plain. On the other hand, the chicken was really good.

I'll probably try them again because they're near my workplace and can satisfy my chinese food craving. I'm interested in seeing/tasting their vegetable, chicken, and house special fried rice."}
{"text":"This was the first Chinese restaurant I found in my area and I haven't looked for anymore. The service is A+ without even tasting the food. I prefer simple Chinese dishes like shrimp fried and beef and broc. Overall, it's convenient and serves quality food. Today I tried the beef with mushrooms in brown sauce."}
{"text":"Once and done. Have eaten Chinese for many years, from north to south, east to west, and around the world, so trust me when I say that this is NOT a place to visit. Giving them 1 star is too much. First off, service is terrible, rude and nasty counter help who want your money but not willing to smile or even attempt to be pleasant. Simple things like, please add the homemade mustard for the egg rolls. Did they include it? No. The egg foo young was over cooked, greasy (dripping) and flavorless. The sauce was not even correct. The Moo Goo Gai pan, Sha Cha Chicken and egg rolls were flavorless, greasy and what wasn't eaten, which was most of it, was thrown out. Not even left over worthy.  Gave them one chance and they blew it so bad we will never return. If you like to eat nasty food, go here. Chung King in a can is better."}
{"text":"Their food is ok, decent priced, but last time I ordered for delivery they took 1 and 1/2 hours. I called to see what the problem was, they did not offer an explanation or apologize so I cancelled the order and haven't gotten anything from there since."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times; in restaurant, pickup and delivery.  I've always been pleased and sated!  Menu is diverse and delicious.  The delivery is very timely and the quantity of food will last more than one meal.  As a matter of fact, I'm ordering again tonight!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Friendly delivery and excellent chicken teriyaki. I do wish my fortune cookie wasn't so mean..."}
{"text":"We got take-out and had terrible food. The Spring Rolls were very small and extra greasy with hardly any filling. In the Shrimp with Broccoli, the shrimp were not fresh at all -- they were small frozen shrimp thawed and cooked until slimy. None of our dishes had any real spice or flavor. Really bad experience."}
{"text":"No exaggeration here.. Delivery took 1:35 min. That's 1 hour and 35 min. They told me 45 min. Food was OK and obviously not hot, but warm enough for driving around in delivery car for likely an hour.. Ordered sun evening 630p delivery to Doubletree.. You've been warned!"}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. I have been waiting for an hour and a half for my delivery and STILL have not gotten it! This business is not worth the time or energy. Pathetic!"}
{"text":"They always say 10 minutes for takeout. 
And they NEVER lie.

Fast, Inexpensive, and Quality."}
{"text":"Great value!! Looking for a low key Chinese restaurant then you found it. Great food, large portions, and decently priced. Today I visited for lunch and ordered the General Tso's combo.  For under 7 bucks I got a large portion of chicken, fried rice, and a fresh crab Rangoon (yes, you just get one but I still opt for this instead of the egg roll) I even had leftovers. The staff was very friendly and the service was fast. So a perfect spot for lunch  if you work nearby. My recommendation is if you do go for lunch break from only eat half or you will be in a food coma the rest of the day. Haha.  If I worked closer i would come here more often.  Could see myself picking up the take out on the way home. This place does deliver but unfortunately my house is too far."}
{"text":"We got take out. It was ready on time, absolutely delicious and the staff was all smiles!  Good experience!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here. Decent delivery time to Holiday Inn Billy Graham -from placing the order to actual delivery only took about 25 minutes. My delivery person was very friendly and Japanese.  That's authentic...
The menu is basic - not much on selection but the food is pretty good. I ordered the Hunan Chicken and a side of crab rangoon. The price was a little steep for delivery though. The menu conveniently forgets to tell you there is a minimum for delivery, and the charge is $1.00 for that convenience. All told, I spend $15.00 for a meal for one person. Again, what I got was pretty good. The Hunan Chicken is mildly spicy - if you're looking for real heat look somewhere else. The crab Rangoon is a little sweet but actually very good. HUGE portion though - I think I only ate a quarter of what they sent me. The rest will get eaten tomorrow on the way back to GA. I'll order from here again, though for the price it probably won't be often."}
{"text":"We ordered food for the first time at this resturant. The delivery was fast but the food was not very good. Two of us ordered the hot and spicy beef, it was very sweet. I asked for broccoli and onions to be added and it was not but I was charged for them. The other two teachers said the sesame chicken was too bready and not tasty, and the chicken and broccoli was just ok"}
{"text":"Still a great cheap Americanized chinese restaurant. For a change of pace, try ordering a dish with different sauce than normal.

As my old review was overwritten by this one (yelp indicated it would only supplant the rating)...

Highly recommend replacing egg roll with their best-in-town hot and sour soup."}
{"text":"Horrible. Horrible food!  Customer service not much better.  Ordered General Tso chicken and it was drenched in sauce. Over cooked pieces of something like chicken but consistently not the same as white meat.  The fried rice was a combination of brown and some white rice mixed up. No onion no vegetables in rice at all. It was not fried rice although guy at front desk was arguably stating this is fried rice.  The menu price list $7.25. I was charged $8.25 +tax making order 8.93.  So not even pricing is consistent here.  It was first and last time ordering from here.  If service is bad I think as a consumer it's important to mention especially when the restaurant is not trying to make good of bad food."}
{"text":"For just a little hole in the wall Chinese takeout this place is actually really good. The owners are also really cool."}
{"text":"I ordered shrimp mei fun and chicken wings to go. Wings still had feathers on them. Check your order before you leave."}
{"text":"Called in an order for dinner and by the time I got there it was ready. Rarely am I made to wait for my order. Got the sesame chicken with white rice. That's my go to for Chinese food. Can't go wrong with that. If you like it on the crispy side, then you just have to tell them and they'll be happy to do it your way. It's a nice crunch. If you like some spiciness, then ask for the hot chili oil. It goes well with it and gives it a nice punch."}
{"text":"Ordered take out at my favorite Chinese Restaurant in the Steel Creek area. I specifically ordered LIGHT ONIONS in my shrimp fried rice as I always do. I did not get light onions again. This would generally not be a big problem BUT! This keeps happening and it's the NEW GUY who keeps doing it. Every time I call and order with the (new guy) he messes up my order regardless of what I've ordered, big time. If this happens one more time I will find somewhere else to buy Chinese food. PLEASE FIX THIS!! I don't want to find another Chinese food restaurant, I enjoy the food at Fortune Cookie were I've been a customer since 2008. The picture I've posted is just some of the onions in the rice I picked out. I ate the rest."}
{"text":"I love the pork fried rice, never had it with bean sprouts! Also the amount of food they give you is ALWAYS alot! Best fast food chinese place around here!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Fast service. I ordered the triple delight extra spicy togo. Good portion size for the price. The beef is nice and tender, but chcken has been worked so much that it's consistency is starting to taste rubbery. The sauce is a bit on the bland side. If they added a bit more sauce to their stir fry dishes the flavor would be perfect. For the price, quality, and portion this place is ok."}
{"text":"I used to come here weekly when i worked down the road. I love the place. Very quick. Food is very hot when it comes out. (But really..... why wouldn't it be??) I love the spring rolls, lo mein, very fresh veggies. ( I love steamed veggies... the snap peas actually SNAP...CRACKLE.. AND POP)

Prices are reasonable, the dining area is nice and neat and clean. When you walk in the door, you're walking right into the check out stand. 

its in a strip mall (ohh did he say \"STRIP MALL\"... what's so bad about that? More reviews i read about a place being in a Strip Mall, most of the reviews have RAVE reviews about it.... ) steps down off SOAP BOX.

If your not affraid of the Big Bad Strip Mall.... go have a good meal and enjoy!!


Cheers"}
{"text":"I've had better Chinese food and the food here was very dry. I won't be coming back to this place so I strongly suggest avoid this place if you want really good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken wings!! Everything else is average and I would suggest staying away from the always overcooked Lo mein."}
{"text":"Honey chicken and crab rangoons were delicious. I give 3 stars because the service was terrible. They did mess up my sides and never really checked on us while we were eating. We finally had to get up and ask for to-go boxes."}
{"text":"I stopped in Fortune Cookie2 after having a bad experience with Wendy's. I had heard about this spot but never actually stopped in. Being here only about 4 yrs I have only found 1 chinese restaurant that I liked and it was way up S. Tryon by Target and we only go there when we reeeeeally want chinese because its a little out of the way.

Fortune Cookie2 is excellent, I had chicken/shrimp & broccolli and I wanted my brocolli soft and they had my order correct and it tasted awesome. I totally reccommend Fortune Cookie2!!"}
{"text":"Fried rice is white rice with a little soy sauce and bits of egg. Bizarre and tasteless. On the other hand - they are the only place that delivers to our neighborhood - so that's a BIG plus."}
{"text":"We had a taste for chinese food last night and was looking for somewhere quick and reasonable in our area and we found this spot. The food was decent, the employees were super nice, and they also mentioned they deliver for $2.00 we will definetly have them on our radar for that alone."}
{"text":"Fortune Cookie has your standard Chinese restaurant menu. The food is prepared quickly, I normally order take out. I call them once I get on the road to the restaurant, and 10 minute later, its ready for pickup. General's chicken, fried rice, with an egg roll is my standard. I also like the Chicken and Broccoli with Friend rice and an egg roll. Don't expect fancy here, but its solid and tasty."}
{"text":"There's something to be said for the workhorse restaurant, a place that may not be the fanciest or best looking, but which will always deliver amazing food time and time again.  Fortune Cookie is one of my workhorses.  I've never set foot in their dining area (and probably never will) yet they've consistently served me some of the best Chinese food I've had in Charlotte. 

They get a glowing 5 stars from me for many reasons:

1) They're easy to order from over the phone
2) The food is never greasy or heavy
3) You can taste the quality of their ingredients
4) They always deliver quicker than they quote
5) Every member of the staff is friendly

There's a good selection of dishes on their menu, so everyone should be able to find a taste they like.  My favorites have been the Chicken Teriyaki appetizers, Crab Rangoon, and the absolutely killer Singapore Mein Fun which I think is their best dish hands down.

One last tip, they get busy as all hell so if you get a recording or a busy signal just call again.  You will eventually get through and it's definitely worth a couple of redials."}
