{"text":"I only ordered fried rice here, so I'm not going to be the best judge of their food quality, but the rice was great!  There was a hint of spicy pepper, and the meat had been marinated correctly before it was fried.  Altogether some of the most thought-through fried rice I've had.  I don't think Americans typically understand that an Asian meal consists of multiple courses, and that it is quite difficult to make right, so people don't give them enough credit for it when they do it.  I would say that if the quality of food remained constant post-fried rice, this place woud have some very good food.  I'll let you know if I ever dare try again.  Beyond the kitchen this restaurant is a bore.  Cheap looking decorations, out-of-place furniture, and hard to understand servers (I was served by some delivery boy from the heart of Western PA, and I still couldn't understand him) made my experience less pleasurable.  Also... 7 dollars for fried rice?!  I could make it for four.  At least they have big servings..."}
{"text":"Best food in the area. Fast and always good. Go to place on the weekend and lunch. Great cold noodle in sesame sauce and your able to order gen tso's with white meat!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the area. I have never had a bad meal there. Appetizers, Entrees and specials are all good."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese food place. They have the best lunch buffet and their chicken with broccoli and General Tsos is the best I've had yet anywhere.  The cheese won tons are probably my favorite appetizer that exists. Nice little family run restaurant. I just had their chicken chow mein and tried chicken fried rice for the first time and both were excellent."}
{"text":"First i want to say the food is really good, but unfortunately there is a hidden charge of an automatic 6% gratuity on every order. This is nowhere stated on the menu, nor were we ever verbally or otherwise informed of this charge ahead of time. For months my family would order food there, pick it up ourselves, and still leave a tip until one day we noticed the charge inconspicuously on the receipt. We have never ordered from there since because i feel it was just a shady thing to do. My disabled mother who doesnt have a lot of money to begin with would treat us there once in a blue moon too and it makes me angry to know they ripped her off with that sneaky charge. Wont ever go there again."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a month. I get general tsos and white rice everytime. The chicken is always good. Rice always taste like its been sitting for hours so basically like most Chinese places. It doesn't stand out in taste from other Chinese places but its closest to me and consistent so 4 stars."}
{"text":"I ordered there several times for delivery. They always deliver in the estimated time (or faster), the food tastes great. The only issue I have sometimes that one of the (Chinese)  employees that answers sometimes the phone is very hard to understand and also has a hard time to understand people ordering, so be prepared to repeat your order a few times, but other than that, great service and great food ... I will try the lunch buffet soon."}
{"text":"I couldn't be more dissatisfied in the quality and the quantity of our most recent order.  We have purchased meals numerous times from this establishment and have watched the quality deteriorate.  Our most recent order of two cashew chicken meals and three egg rolls consisted of significantly smaller portion sizes with one order having only ONE cashew! Additionally, the egg rolls were not completely cooked and we're raw on the inside.  We feel cheated and we are done paying more and getting less all the way around at Hunan Palace."}
{"text":"If this was on the West Coast, it would be considered merely decent, but in Pittsburgh I've learned to accept the local variations on Hunan sytle cuisine.   Had the lunch buffett; limited selection but very filling and with fine entrees. Really good crab rangoon. Fried rice was just ok.   Excellent service, not normally too crowded."}
{"text":"I've beem to Hunan Palace many times. It's nowhere near my home, but it's just off Rt. 30, which I travel a lot. I stop there whenever I'm passing by and have a yen for Chinese food. The place is situated in a strip mall very close to an Aldis; when I first went, I didnt' expect much. I was just very hungry.  The ambience is not much except for a very large (12 ft?) picture of a dragon and some sort of bird on one of walls. Ir's truly magnificent. Of course, there's the ubiquitous fish tank.  The food is top notch. The portions are generous. The dishes are delicious, and chock full of whatever they're supposed to contain: shrimp, chicken, pork, etc. I ordered shrimp in black bean sauce the other day. There must have been fifteen to twenty large shirimp in it!  Service is good; there's not much waiting around for an order to come.  This isn't a fancy place by any stretch of the imagination, but it''s a sure bet for delicious. food.*  *EXCEPT for the spare ribs. Don't order them. They are not prepared the way most Chinese spare ribs are done. The owner came up with a special recipe that he thinks is wonderful. It's not."}
{"text":"Still has the best Egg Foo Yong in the Burgh! Whether you get chicken or shrimp. The shrimp fried rice is also very good with large shrimp and a good mix of veggies & flavor. The shrimp rolls are light and crisp with just the right amount of filling wrapped around generous sized shrimp. Also we like the cold noodles with sesame sauce mild version, which has a really tasty peanut sauce. Their food never disappoints."}
{"text":"We decided to take Chinese food to mom and dad's for Mother's Day.  Hunan Palace was on the way.  While we were regulars here almost 20 years ago when we lived in the neighborhood, we wondered if things had changed.  Surprisingly, the food was still excellent, and was a great value too!  We asked for special heat levels for my parents, and they were spot on.  Great job!!  We'll have to stop by more often!!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to Chinese restaurant in the area.  We always get take-out, we have never eaten in the restaurant.  My kids enjoy the lo mein - the noodles are round like spaghetti and the quantity is large, so we get several meals out of 1 order.    They are very quick and the price is right.    I agree that the inside of the restaurant could use an update!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese overall. It's my go to spot near my house for take out. The staff is always friendly and food is always decent."}
{"text":"They messed up my order and wanted to charge me again. Seriously? They lost my business and I made sure they were aware of that."}
{"text":"This is a typical family owned Chinese restaurant just you will find in most any strip mall anywhere - not fancy and a little dated.   What isn't typical are the food and the owners. They've been at this location for a long time, they are fixtures in the community and their food is great.   Standard Chinese fare, good prices, excellent quality. When you order something spicy, it's spicy. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I had anything from here, though, I did have it delivered. The delivery driver was very kind, thanking me for the tip, the food was piping hot, generous servings, the price was on point. I was surprised when it took less than 30 minutes for it to be delivered. Usually, when I order delivery, I receive a call asking for directions, this time I didn't. I'd definitely order again."}
{"text":"I eat at/order from Hunan's Palace at least twice a month and have been doing so since 2013. The owners are nice and the food is definitely above average for your standard strip mall, American Chinese. The quality is good, the flavor is there, and the portions are huge. The price is high but on point considering the quality and portions are larger than some places. The decor is extremely dated and the restaurant facility it self feels a little run down but the other restaurants in the area are even worse. I can overlook it given their food is consistently good.  The reason I think that Hunan's deserves a 5-star is because they are consistent. Every dish I've had, from Chicken w. Broccoli to Lo Mein to Szechuan Beef, has been very good and has been a pleasant meal. As far as the Forest Hills area goes, this is by far the best you'll find! Give them a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Hunan's Palace offers a great lunch buffet at certain hours during weekdays for business and homebody's in the area. It's a great price and the buffet is very good, wish there were more of a food section offered, but what is there is really good. There is never a crowd and for the most part your able to pick where you would like to sit. Hunan's Palace is located at the end of a strip mall in Forest Hills, with plenty of free parking. They offer take out and will deliver just to the surrounding area. They offer coupon discounts when your able to find them. The restaurant is reasonable priced for American Chinese food. It is convenient being only two Chinese restaurants in the area. We have been going for years now and it has kind of lost its charm for me. I do like the buffet when I am home during the week day and able to go. We do not order out as often as we used to. The owners have always been friendly, not as talkative as they used to be, but very polite. I see mostly the husband these days, the wife is mostly in the kitchen now if at all. If you can over look the outdated decor, it is not a bad place for dinner or lunch. I would recommend take out, it's quick and packaged very well.  The chicken dishes are well prepared, I like the freshness of the vegetables and the good hot sauces that they make. I also have been ordering from the healthier menu with the white sauce and more vegetables, and less of the meats or poultry. The fried rice's have all been consistently good.  I love the spring rolls, but I am not fond of the egg rolls. The Won Ton Soup is too salty for me and I like the pork shredded on top of the soup and not in the wrapper.  As for a comment made by someone about an extra gratuity added to the bill, I can't speck to that, I have never had that happen to me. I am sure if you speck to the owner he will explain."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here. They are attentive, polite, and eager to please. I've been here now five times and have ordered something different each time. They have received my dietary restrictions with no anger or problems. Food is fresh and very good!"}
{"text":"Not a lot to say. It's a step above the standard Chinese place. Not a takeout counter, but not fancy or secret Chinese menu authentic either. I just think it doesn't deserve the low average it has.   They have very good quality meat in their dishes. Their staff (husband and wife owners typically) are friendly. Buffet is nice but could be bigger."}
{"text":"I get takeout here a couple of times a month. Great food, nice service, and great reliability. The lunch special are very reasonably priced for the size. Love the hot and sour soup."}
{"text":"I've been going here for as long as they've been open -- over 20 years. The owners are really nice people, and the food is always good. They have the best hot and sour soup out of anywhere I've been. I've probably eaten everything on their menu at one time or another. I love their steamed dumplings and the fact that they will do off-menu special requests. The prices are reasonable and delivery is always crazy fast. Go!"}
{"text":"I moved several minutes from Hunan's Palace in March and have been tempted to try this restaurant ever since then. A Chinese food craving hit me on Thursday afternoon, and I just had to stop by.  I ordered Chicken Egg Rolls, Cheese Wontons, Fried Rice, and Sweet and Sour Chicken. I was told that the wait would be ten minutes and decided to pick up a couple things at Giant Eagle during that time. I dashed over there and back -- I would be surprised if it was actually ten minutes -- and the man that I ordered from had all my food packed up and ready to go when I returned. I'm definitely impressed by the speed of their service!  Though not cheap -- I believe that I paid $26 for the four items -- the Fried Rice and Sweet and Sour Chicken were very large portions. Though my husband and I finished off most of the food within one meal, we had Fried Rice around for several days. I personally enjoyed all the food, particularly the Cheese Wontons and Sweet and Sour Chicken.  I was a little uncertain about trying this restaurant but thought that the food and service were surprisingly good. I definitely plan on coming back sometime soon!"}
{"text":"This may be the worst Chinese food I have ever had. The rice is bland, no amount of soy sauce can fix it. I have ordered from here twice hoping it would be better...unfortunately that was not the case. I ordered sweet and sour chicken the last time, it was not sweet or sour it was tangy with some spice. It was also really greasy. YUCK! Will not waste money again."}
{"text":"Good place for the American traditional version of oriental food. I've ordered from here a number of times over the 30 some years I've lived in Forest Hills. Hunan has been consistent every time, whether I've eaten in or just ordered take out. Never had one issue here. Decent fare.  The restaurant could use a good cleanup and going over...the fishtank is old, there are cleaning supplies sitting out by the entranceway along with fish food...presentation isn't just about the meal, it's also part of the facility. They are trodding along though, and have a steady customer base. Good enough...but they could do a bit to improve, and it'd serve their business and customers well to consider sprucing/cleaning up."}
{"text":"The food here is great! I ordered the General Tso chicken and  cup of Wonton Soup, and it was the best I have ever had.  Unlike most Chinese restaurants the chicken was all white meat and very fresh.  The chicken is actually chicken and not just a nugget of deep fried batter like most.  The food is very delicious BUT I would say that the price is almost not worth it.  For one person, you can justify eating here, but for a quick bite to eat for you and your wife, it will cost you more than 30 dollars."}
{"text":"Came here after finding a nearby restaurant stopped serving food at 9:00 pm  Found the menu reasonable and the portions generous.  Did not get charged for steamed rice which is unheard of in CA.  Very pleased with the meal"}
