{"text":"We just discovered this place but it has only been open a month. I am going to Shanghai in a month and I have been reading about steam buns stuffed with pork and hand pulled noodles. This restaurant has both and they were delicious. The steam buns (#11) are large. There are 6 in the order so these are a meal in themselves! The menu items are different from what we normally see in Calgary so there are many new things to try. We tried the cold pork hock which comes with a spicy garlic sauce. A large plate arrived, thinly sliced - a lot for 2 people so we brought some home. It was very delicious. It appears that most food is made in-house and what we had was very fresh and delicious. Highly recommend you check it out!"}
{"text":"The worst Chinese food ever!  Small greasy portions.  Couldn't even get fried rice right"}
{"text":"This is a very authentic Chinese restaurant, the real deal Chinese homemade food! If you are looking for Westernized Chinese food, this may not be the place for you. If you are looking for an authentic experience, look no further!

We ordered Jian Bing Guo Zi and it is exactly what we have tasted in China, couldn't get enough of it!"}
{"text":"I always like small businesses. The waitress is friendly. Food is great. The restroom is not quite good that takes off a star from my 4-star rating.

Will reorder the following:

{"text":"Very sterling Chinese Tianjin flavour with delicate homemade food. Hope everyone who is looking for and love authentic Chinese food may take a taste."}
{"text":"Good decent northern Chinese cuisine.  I am surprised that it is not more busy during lunch time.  The service is good and there is plenty of free outdoor and covered parking.  I will be back to check out their other items."}
{"text":"I ordered some takeout through skipthedishes. I tried the Sliced Lamb with Cumin, Tianjin Style Meat Buns, Handmade Dumplings and Spicy String Beans.  The stand out dish was the green beans they were full of flavour and perfectly crunchy.  The homemade dumplings were quite tasty as well.  The lamb with cumin was a little subtle in flavour than I'm used to.  The Tianjin bun was alright; it was a little heavy on the bun portion compared to the meat. I prefer the food at long's to this place because I prefer spice. If you don't like to eat spicy then this place is for you."}
