{"text":"Very big portions for the price.. Quality was decent.. Not the best Chinese food by any stretch, but definitely good value..   Make sure you order well in advance.. This place gets busy on weekend nights and the take-out can take a while.. All in all, you get what you pay for and I would return"}
{"text":"The stereotypical North American Chinese food fare.   Having said that, ain't nothing wrong with a little beef fried rice, sweet and sour pork and some broccoli beef when you're too busy binge watching the first 2 seasons of The Last Ship.  May be formulaic, but it's the best this side of Spadina and Dundas."}
{"text":"This place had the best Chinese food I've ever had. My family has been going there for over a decade now and have always been pleased with the food. Prices are very reasonable and the food is always top notch. The service is average but we know the owners and exactly what we want now so we don't need much service. Things we order consistently :  Hot and sour soup Cantonese chow mien with shrimp Lemon chicken Calgary crispy beef Shrimp fried rice  These dishes always taste top notch and I have never been disappointed. Oh and the portion sizes are huge! Whenever we get those dishes above we always have at least 1-2 meals of leftovers again. I have been to other places that utterly disappoint me compared to Golden Stove. It's worth the longer drive to make sure the food I get tastes great. Way to my go Golden Stove. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Went to this place with my girl last night. It was pretty good. The portions were fucking huge and we definitely ordered too much food for $35. Be sure to call ahead if you want take out, because it's going to take 20 mins for them to cook everything up!  Although I had better chinese food but I think this is one of the better chinese restaurants within the Etobicoke area. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten here twice, but each time was an impromptu affair that left me thinking \"I really couldn't have picked a better place\".   My first time visiting the restaurant was a fluke happenstance. My girlfriend and I were hungry and walking in the general area looking for restaurants that were still open. The store itself is situated in a very unassuming location and almost mends with it's surroundings. Indeed, when one thinks of a quality hole-in-the-wall establishment, Golden Stove definitely fits the bill.  Upon entering, the employee/owner of the restaurant looked up from his chair and eyed my girlfriend and I down. He muted the volume on the TV show he was watching and approached us and asked if we would like to stay or take out. I said we'd stay.  The restaurant was empty so my girlfriend and I had a fairly roomy experience. The TV was softly humming as we looked over the menu. It was your standard selection of chinese food. As my eyes skimmed over the combination plates, I had to do a double-take. The prices of these combination plates were low. Suspiciously low. I had to assume the portions must have been tiny. Still, I took a leap of faith and ordered a combination  plate that included chicken fried rice, sweet and sour pork and an egg roll. My girlfriend picked something similar, but with Chicken Balls.  The order took maybe 10 minutes to arrive on our table but when it did, my jaw hung low. There was a lot of food. An impossibly huge amount of food for 6 dollars. I couldn't believe it. It tasted great too. Salty and savoury to the right extent and just filled the palette with enough variety that I found myself mellowing into a mild stupor while shovelling food into my mouth.  The owner sat with us for a moment to ask how the food was, to which we responded very positively. He asked if he were from the area, to which I said we've been around for less than year. He told us that the restaurant was a very exclusive restaurant and that he typically only served people by word-of-mouth and that the restaurant itself is only open for a period of 4 hours every night. We just happened to walk in at the right time. I told him that I we were really lucky to be just walking by. He smirked and said something that no restaurant owner has ever said to me: \"Well, the service kinda sucks but the food's pretty good, right?\" and with that he walked back to the TV and started watching it again.   We were halfway through our meal when I realized we couldn't eat anymore so we took the rest of the meal to go. To which it served an entire meal again by leftovers alone.  I've since gone again and ordered the same meal to see whether or not was a fluke, but this time it was to go. The food arrived in a plastic bag and the quantity, as I had hoped, was insanely huge. My girlfriend and I ended up eating it together and we still couldn't quite get through all of it.  The only downside, if you want to even call it that, is that the establishment only accepts cash, but that is something I could have expected easily based on the overall look of the place.  Only open between 6pm and 10pm, if there is even the slightest craving for chinese food, the Golden Stove definitely scratches that itch in spades. Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"*    *    *    *    *  UPDATE *    *    *    *    *  Ok, the food was yummy. Really good sized portions and flavourful. We took home the Crispy Chicken Wings, Beef Chow Mein, Chicken with vegetables and 2 spring rolls for  $30. My hubby can really pack away the food, and we still have tons of leftovers!  The spring rolls were huge and delicious with a nice thick crunch to them. The chicken with vegetables was ok. The beef chow mein was my dinner and I had lots of leftover for my lunch the next day. I think it was actually better the next day. Lots of beef, although not very many vegatables, and too many onions. It was the crispy chicken wings that was the surprise winner of dinner. So good! So saucy and so crunchy!! I don't even really like chicken wings, my husband ordered them for himself, but i had to steal a few because they looked and smelled so delicious.    I'd say the food was 4 stars and the service was 2 stars, so I'll give Golden Stove 3 stars overall. I might come back here for the food, but I'm gonna try another place in the area as well. They haven't quite won me over yet."}
{"text":"So here's the deal.  I may be in trouble for writing this review and sharing it with the wider world or rather GTA.  Friends of ours insist this is a great place for Chinese food.  They are willing to drive all the way from Hamilton to dine here every couple of months.  We heard the server who is the son in law tell other patrons that he doesn't want many customers as he wants to continue to serve the locals.  You need patience to eat here whether it's eat in or take out.   The wait is  long especially for the food.  We hear him tell other tables that they will have to wait awhile as other tables came before them.  There is also a steady stream of take out pick up throughout the evening that seems to take priority.  We ordered the sweet and sour wantons, shrimp fried rice, Calgary crispy ginger beef, beef with broccoli, and cashew chicken.  The portions as noted by others are huge and, given the prices, an absolute deal.  More importantly, all the food is absolutely delicious.  The sweet and sour wanton are light and crispy and not greasy and the sweet and sour sauce is perfect.  The crispy ginger beef and the cashew chicken are particularly good.  Some other tables ordered wonton soup and at $3.50 a bowl, it was an absolutely ginormous bowl of soup that they were served.  It is cash only and he seems to round up or down the total bill but don't worry whatever you're paying, it is so worth the price as it is a steal of a deal no matter what. I wish I were a local as I would eat here every single week, heck 2 or 3 times a week if I could!"}
{"text":"It's so hard to find a good Chinese food place in Etobicoke, so I'm glad I tried this place. It cost me $20.00 for chicken fried rice, vegetable chow mein and honey garlic ribs. By the time I got home the sauce from the ribs was all over the bag so they were dry and didn't taste that good, so I probably won't get them next time. Everything else was soooo good!  I haven't had good Chinese food in a while! I'm going back for sure! I don't think they deliver though."}
{"text":"Terrible hours, literally the quintessential \"hole in the wall\", this place is a dive. We waited well over 1 hour 20 min for shitty food. This place is depressing and needs so many improvements, I don't know where to start. Hire some staff. Give the inside a major cleaning and makeover, as the walls are super dirty and there are cobwebs. The seats are cracked and dirty. I'm pretty sure this is a one man show, and he's making the prices up as he goes. Portions are huge, but it's gross food. The owner is grumpy and off putting. The beef was slimy and everything made us sick. Never ever ever again!   Waste of $60"}
{"text":"HIRE A COUPLE OF STAFF....  main guy is pretty grumpy, some help might be beneficial. 1hr wait for take out (or longer) and 80 minutes for eat in (trust me this dive is tough to sit in).  Blaring awful BBC TV show on, horrible interior. Tables broken, chairs worn, old. All prices rounded up, no credit, no debit.  Awful experience. VIP.. spent almost 90 minutes in restaurant and a couple hours in the bathroom :( Never returning."}
{"text":"Will make this short and sweet. I see some mixed reviews on the service here. You have to remember this place caters to the locals. I get how it can be irritating for some but come in here with an open mind. The only thing that matters is the food here, don't worry about appearance here you won't get it, only locals will. This isn't fine dining madams and monsours. Food is great and never really had a bad experience and we used to live in area and got take out quite often here. Wait or don't wait either way you will have a difficult time finding good Chinese food in the area other than Canadian Chinese food (cough cough Mandarin)"}
{"text":"My second time here and I can't believe how tasty the food is!!  The place is a family restaurant cooking up Canadian Chinese food...ie sweet& sour chicken balls, chow mien, etc but it also has some dishes that are out of this world....  I tried the empress chicken which was sweet, tangy and had a nice kick.  The chicken was tender and fresh and the veggies were so fresh. I also had their Cashew nut chicken, hunan beef and it was also awesome. Definitely trying other stuff the next time I go back.  Portion size...huge, price not so much. I suggest calling them and ordering take out as the last time I went and waited they were crazy busy.  Btw they are only open for dinner!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout by phone, was quoted an hour. Arrived an hour later, was told it was busy and would be an extra 15 minutes. 35 minutes later I was ready to walk out and was told 5 more minutes. 10 minutes later it was ready.  Portion sizes were huge, food was alright, but honestly they should raise the prices and hire some people. And maybe buy some Windex and a mop. We won't order again."}
{"text":"First timer...I did not know that they only opened at 6PM  Knocked on door and young guy opened. After my order he told me \" this is too much food for 2. Drop a dish.\" I went for wine and when I got back learned that they were cash only. No debit or CC \"Pay me next time\" What great service....and the food was awesome and huge portions.  I will go back to pay him and pick up my next order."}
{"text":"By far the worst EVER.I want to start by saying i have never wrote a review. Ok so on with it, i have never had a waiter while taking my order drink a beer. After a hour of waiting i was told to relax it's only going to take another 1/2 hour."}
