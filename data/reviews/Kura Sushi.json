{"text":"Good variety, excellent quality and consistent.  Really affordable. They make their own soy sauce and it's really tasty. The dining room is not super comfy but it's a great spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"Good service, nice soup and salad. The spider roll with the soft shell crab is amazing and you can't go wrong with the green dynamite rolls."}
{"text":"This is the place I go to when I have clients pop in on me at home.  I work at home and love to have a place to meet up at.  Sick of the coffee shop atmosphere and love the service and fantastic food we get here.  The quality is superb and keeps me going back for more.  Party trays are a BIG hit with me and my family.  Whenever we Host a get together, Kura gets my party platter ready and its what my guests talk about first.  We are regulars because Kura earned it by providing what we all want...Value and Family style service!"}
{"text":"Great service and food in a bizarre location.  I ordered the 22 piece deluxe dinner and was very happy with the whole meal. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in Mississauga. Fresh food and melt-in-the-mouth fish. A great choice in menu."}
{"text":"Fish was very fresh and tasty.  Wonderful spot.  Service was top notch and server was extremely personable."}
{"text":"For the most part, I usually agree with my fellow Yelper Stephanie S. but I can understand why we diverged so much this time. Her review was from 2014, and so let's just say things at Kura Sushi have changed.....for the worst.  A co-worker and I decided to go out for lunch today. He recommended Kura Sushi. He said it was good and the prices decent.  So we ordered off the flyer he had.  I had the bento (beef teriyaki, salmon teriyaki, sushi & maki - were my 3 choices). Co-worker pretty much ordered the same.  When we arrived, the 10% take-out discount was no longer offered. Cashier said it was \"probably from an old flyer\". Also shocked to find out that prices for every dish had increased by at least $1.  FYI, the \"previous\" lunch specials like beef teriyaki have gone up $2 (from $10.95 to $12.95). So my bento with a side order of spicy tuna maki roll came up to $23; DEFINITELY not worth it!!! (I told my colleague we should go to Park Sushi next time at that price point.)  Ok to put make matters worse, I asked for some spicy mayo and the cashier told me it would be another $1. LMAO :( PASS.  The food itself was ok, it wasn't great, but also not bad. We live in the GTA, so I would never say anything fresh unless I eat the seafood caught right at the fish markets of Japan.  On the way back to the office, co-worker laughed and said the only reason he had not gone there in a while was that it was \"pricey\", so needless to say after this price increase, he (and I) won't be visiting there ever."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place in the hour I had to kill with a friend before picking up someone from the airport.  I've been to DOZENS of sushi places in downtown Toronto, but I have to say, this restaurant makes very delicious sushi and maki. It is fresh, the service is wonderful (we were there for dinner), and just overall such a treat. I would love if they opened a spot up downtown so I could come more frequently but if I'm ever out west on the 401 again, I will definitely be stopping by here. Give it a shot! Reasonably priced and made well. Perfect fish to rice ratio."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the folks who run this place are very kind and friendly. The location is clean and food is made to order on the spot. Even the teacups and wooden chopsticks are better quality than other places.  Worth a visit for sure."}
{"text":"Great little sushi place tucked away in a very industrial area. Don't be weary of the outside appearance, go in and enjoy delicious sushi with excellent personalized service!   Loved the sweet hostess, very attentive."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went to Kura Sushi around 9:40 last night. I wasnt expecting that we will be served with freshly prepared food, to think that they close at 10. Most of the japanese restos we've been to who close at 10 take their last order at 9:30. We ordered a bento box and a dinner maki tray. The meat was really juicy and tender. And the mixed tempura was oh so crunchy. Customer service was also A+!  Definitely goes to our favorites list!"}
{"text":"Found this place in Yelp it is in the middle of industrial area. Great new age music playing creating a calm atmosphere, good customer service, sushi was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Was passing by after visiting Chua Phap Van, and I have to say, this is one of the best, high quality restaurants I've been to.  I ordered the Crab Salad, and it was very good.  It tasted amazing with a very nice sauce to it.  I honestly want to return and order the salad again, favourite part of my visit.  I then ordered the Sushi combo C and it was fresh and tasted great.  Finally I also ordered the Seafood Udon and Salmon Teriyaki.  The Udon was a bit stale with not much flavour but wasn't horrible.  The Salmon Teriyaki was amazing and I loved how they did it.  Overall, service was also very good as the waitress was very attentive.  While I was there a man walked in with his family and said this was the best Jap restaurant in all of Mississauga, and I think it's a very high contender! :)  I highly recommend this hidden gem of Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Stayed at nearby hotel. Just wanted to get sushi to go around 9pm and found this place on Yelp! The place is definitely in an odd location but so happy I went here. The price was very reasonable. Highest priced Maki was $8.95. Sushi was mostly $1.50/1pc.  I had black dragon roll ($8.95), chop chop scalloped maki ($4.95), and salmon maki ($3.95) plus tax =$19.65. Plenty to eat and they were fresh and tasty!  Highly recommend for to-go!!"}
{"text":"Ok...no joke this place is still the best!  I came back again today for lunch with a couple of friends and still give a thumbs up.  Compared to many sushi places I've been around Mississauga, this is still my favourite.  If you don't mind the atmosphere and just there for the food, you will love this place.  Food seems to be always fresh and service again was very friendly.  The servers came around several times to see if we needed anything.  This could be my regular to go!"}
{"text":"Great quality and prices. Nice hidden spot. We stop by almost by accident and we loved it.  We have returned several times and the food is great."}
{"text":"Came on a saturday right on opening hr, place is sort of hidden. The ambiance is a little weird in that the table sets sort of remind me of a western diner place mixed with japanese elements. But overall really relaxing to be in.  Beef sashimi was ordered, and it was really well prepared, well presented, and tasted quite good. That was my first time with beef sashimi so I'd definitely try that again. Had their lunch bento boxes which was just over 12 dollars, where you can mix and match with a list of pick 3 options. I choose sashimi, chicken yakitori and gyoza, and it came with soup and salad. All of it tasted alright - pretty good. I was slightly disappointed with the sashimi portion, 6 small pieces - 2 of which were the \"crab meat\" pieces.  Service was incredibly friendly and attentive. Would come here again to try more foods. Not sure if it's the \"best\" place, but definitely a very good place to stop by for a quick sushi meal with decent prices."}
{"text":"Service and quality going down. Won't be returning anymore. Tempura was cold and overcooked. Literally 4 strips of chicken katsu. Seemed they were being stingy with providing green tea (the actual pot), I mean..if I'm paying 2.00 for green tea, give me the pot and not just the little cup. Guess I have to find a new sushi joint with good service."}
{"text":"I was visiting from NYC with family for a conference and we had dinner at this place. The service was superior. The lady was so patient and helpful even with 1 baby and 3 little kids. One of the kids spilled her glass of water and she quickly came and cleaned it up. She even told the kid not to worry and it happens which was very nice of her. The food was excellent. Being from NYC, we get some of the best sushi. This place was fresh and well made. I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for quality service and quality sushi!"}
{"text":"This place is quite hidden (though not exactly as a hidden gem in my opinion), located in a corner of a building in a more corporate/industrial area.   I went in for the lunch special Sushi & Maki Combo (14 pcs, $10.95), including sushi, tuna maki, dynamite maki, and salmon maki. I was excited, this sounded like all the makings of a good combo! But unfortunately, the meal fell below expectations. Even though the price is not considered expensive in the area, I did not feel it equated to value in terms of amount and quality.   Miso soup and salad dressing was overly salty, and sushi was pretty - well - medicore. Salmon was alright, but tuna seemed a little bit fishy (ie. not as fresh). The good thing was that the rolls weren't packed in rice, but the sushi seemed quite bland that I actually lost interest in eating them. I'm not sure how other items (eg. sashimi, cooked items) fare as I did not get to try them.  The server was very nice/friendly and attentive, and because it's a small place it offers some good privacy! However, I left the meal feeling unsatisfied and unimpressed - my stomach not full, taste buds left hanging, my brain processing what felt off about the meal, and leaving the place wanting more...   Sadly, nothing nagging at me to come back at this time, and will probably venture elsewhere in the area to get my sushi fix."}
{"text":"This place was difficult to find, but we're glad we stumbled upon it. Sushi was great and fresh! They have a good menu, and some sushi and maki combos. If you want a good combination of sushi, maki, and sashimi the Sushi Deluxe dinner is good for its value. Their bento boxes were good as well, you can build your own. Nice ambiance and very clean. Would definitely go back here again!"}
{"text":"The server was so sweet and the food was absolutely fantastic. The fish was extremely fresh and overall atmosphere was lovely. Definitely a place I would go to again"}
{"text":"Met up with a bunch of sushi loving friends here on a Friday night, and to be honest, I think I ordered the wrong thing. The best thing to order here is likely their bento box - at only $13.98, you choose three sides.  I chose to forego the bento due to previous photos; I wanted the sashimi, but saw from other Yelpers' photos that there are two pieces of imitation crab. Thinking it wouldn't be a good deal, I chose the chirashi.  My friend got the bento box and surprisingly, hers came with tako. Ironically, my chirashi had two pieces of imitation crab, two pieces of really dry and nasty tasting tamago (egg), and loads of cucumber slices and pickled radish. I wasn't very pleased to find that the chirashi, at almost $18, had so many fillers. The six pieces of salmon were quite good, but the red tuna was very dry and stringy. Absolutely no taste. I found the quality to be quite inferior.  My other friends ordered the maki dinner, and I sampled one of their rainbow rolls. The shrimp tempura inside was noticeably stale.  I also wasn't aware that they charged each of us an additional $1 for tea. We were given greatly diluted tea, offered in a very small pot shared among the six of us.  I won't return, sorry Kura sushi. Compared to other sushi joints, the price is quite high but the quality just isn't there."}
{"text":"Good food good place :) the waitress is very nice and the yaki udon is very chewy. I ordered sashimi appetizer and there came with 4 kinds of sashimi with reasonable price. Good weekend go to dinner restaurant."}
{"text":"SUPER IMPRESSED! Seriously, what is with all these hidden gems? Where have y'all been all my life!?  Why no 5 stars? From my experience, I wholeheartedly, want to give them 5 stars for their take-out service.   Service was great! The sushi chef & cashier in this mom & pop joint, were super genuine and friendly.   The food was definitely fresh! We ordered the 'chop chop scallop roll' $4.50, 'unagi maki' $5.25, and the 'sushi maki' dinner combo $12.95.  Hands down, the best takeout sushi, I've had. Hope this place keeps the standards up!"}
{"text":"Most friendly staff to top the experience.  Bento boxes come with salad and miso soup with choice of 3 items from the list. I chose assorted tempera - super crispy, cake with 2 shrimp, a zucchini exploding with juicy goodness and a purple yam, didn't expect to find this here but was such a good contrast to the other flavors sashimi - salmon, tuna, white tuna, squid, surf clam; decent, fresh and teriyaki chicken - sitting on a bed of sauce, refrains it from getting soggy, nice attention to detail  for the price, it was alright and i certainly was stuffing myself a bit but could see that it may not be enough for someone with a bigger appetite  sitting in an industrial zone, it could be hard to find but mmmm the tempura"}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Mississaga at this price range, tucked away in a random office park with no other eateries anywhere nearby!   They have amazing lunch specials and the bento box is one of the best. There are 16 items to choose from and you choose 3 for $12.25! I usually order ahead for takeout and they always pack the food really well (no Styrofoam). The few times I've eaten in, the service was very friendly. I would recommend the oyako-don (huge portion) and any of the sushi/maki combos. But my absolute favorite is the bento box selection.   Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in an industrial plaza, not easy to find. Not what I expected from the outside, but pleasantly surprised once inside. Clean, nice atmosphere.  Friendly staff, good menu selection. Seafood miso was very good! Deluxe sushi dinner was excellent with good size portions, fresh, great flavors. Highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place based on yelp reviews and wasn't disappointed. We were nearly the only table due to the early hour, so enjoyed prompt attention and quick service without feeling rushed. We went with our 8mo old and she was welcomed and they provided a booster seat (parents, note it's only a booster, not a high chair, so she was a little short for the table as it goes on the seat). They also were not offended in the least that we fed her food we brought with us (though we had her try some of our order).   We went for the sashimi, sushi and maki platter (42pc), veg tempura, and miso soup. Very fresh tasting, and happy to have two pieces of taro and perhaps the best tempura broccoli I've ever had. Pleasantly full at the end of it.   Service was stellar. I think it's what raises this above the other sushi restaurants in the area. We would recommend it and would definitely return."}
{"text":"High quality sushi that is made with care.  The bbq eel roll was delicious.  Also tried a deep fried tuna roll that came with a side of home made dressing to dip the pieces in which was such a delicious and unique combo.  Everything seemed fresh and the rice had perfect texture and seasoning.  Would be nice to see some sushi/maki combos available on the menu outside of lunch time, but I'm sure they'll add that on soon.  The owner was really friendly as well.    It is worth visiting if you're in the area - more so for take-out/delivery as there are fancier Japanese restaurants to dine in for."}
{"text":"Really not worth the money. Spent $47 when it should only cost $30. And no miso soup? Come on"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is rated this high, went there for lunch with a friend, both of us think this is just a so-so sushi place. Nothing fancy or tasty, fill your belly I guess."}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer to this place so I could come here more often.  Honestly this place has amazing prices and the sushi is so good! They give you a lot for how much they are charging and they are so nice, was a really nice restaurant.  Any time I am in Mississauga I will stop by here."}
{"text":"While attending a home show at the Internation Centre in Toronto, we found Kura Sushi on yelp and decided to give it a try.  Fantastic.  Like other have said, It's a small restaurant in a  business park, but the signs are readable from Britannia Road.  We were there for dinner and they weren't that busy.  The sushi was excellent and I asked why more people weren't there and she said that they do more lunch time business (being in a business park, that makes sense).  The presentation of the sushi was excellent.  I travel a lot, and while there are many good sushi restaurants, this one was like finding a little gem. These people are friendly and happy, and it shows in their service and food. So good, went twice."}
{"text":"Sort of tucked away in an industrial zone is a small little sushi oasis called Kura Sushi.  Located near the northwest intersection of Britannia and Kennedy Road just south of the 401 is a rather small almost out of place establishment that has some good eats as far as a la carte sushi goes.  Japanese for me ranks right up there as one of my favorite cuisines and it's not often I'll have it two evenings in a row.  I just went to August 8 in Bramalea City Centre the evening before with a bunch of friends for dinner and the only reason I'd have it the following evening was because my nephew who just celebrated his 12th birthday was craving sushi for his celebratory dinner.    I wasn't really looking to go back to another AYCE place and wanted a bit of a change so I was able to pick a place that my fellow Yelpers recommended and that wasn't too far from where my family live in Mississauga.    There were 6 of us (4 adults and 2 children) and it wasn't that busy when we arrived but more people started to come in during the evening since it was around dinner time.  I decided to change things up a bit because just having sushi the night before I ended up getting the chicken katsu dinner and a salmon skin roll on the side.  They had a build your own bento which has about 16 choices or so and you can choose 3 for 14 bucks and that's what my mom ended up ordering.  My wife asked for the seafood udon bowl (soup) while everybody else just got a different mix of maki rolls.  The service was very friendly and the quality of the food was great.  I noticed the rolls were not heavy on the rice and light on the inside either.  The portions were good sized and the rolls were constructed well.  I have to say when it comes to a la carte sushi places I tend to expect more that is, better quality food over quantity which is what most AYCE places are about.    Kura is a nice, smaller family style a la carte menu sushi place which has a lot of variety in their menu to select from as well as good quality servings with good sized portions.  As far as a la carte Japanese places this is definitely one of the better ones for value and quality in the north central Mississauga area."}
{"text":"One of the best finds of our trip to Toronto.  This is an excellent sushi restaurant.   As another reviewer said, it is tucked in an industrial area, you would never find it you were not looking.  The quality of the sashimi was incredible.  Rolls were creative, pricing was excellent.  The staff are friendly and polite.  I may go back for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"It's a small Restaurant with a very food atmosphere, good sushi variety and sushi rolls are great."}
{"text":"Really great ambiance.. Small place but the vibes are warm and welcoming. Seems like a family business.   Sushi: got the maki,sushi,sashimi lunch combo. Great value and pretty good quality sushi. Really was a joy and delight to devour. ;)   Desert was good, had the cheesecake. Would deffs visit again if in the area. :)"}
{"text":"Food was fresh, service was excellent. Best miso soup I've ever had. We had bento boxes and shared a green dragon. Every bite was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi joint overall. Definitely deserves the 5 stars. The ambience is fantastic, really mellow and laid back, the music selection is excellent light electronic and jazz. The service is also excellent, extremely friendly and accommodating people work here. The sushi is fantastic in quality, the ideal freshness, texture, and taste. Value could be a tiny bit better for the food but the entire experience was worth the 15 I paid after taxes for the sushi maki dinner which came with 6 assorted sushi, 3 spicy crispy salmon, 3 spicy crispy tuna, and 4 California and miso soup. It's silly to say but I really felt as though I was in a small hidden sushi joint in the streets of Japan."}
{"text":"Wonderfully kind service! Came here because of the good reviews and I was not disappointed! Very fairly priced & delicious food! Got the dynamite roll & avocado roll along with many other sides. Would definatly recommend their dynamite roll!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a hidden gem. A small sushi place in a office plaza... What do you know?!  Pretty awesome I'd say.  My friend who works in the area suggested this place as she has came a few times for lunch.  We were exhausted and pretty hungry and glad service was quick and food came out promptly.   The menu has variety and the prices are really good. They have this bento box option where you get to choose 3 items. This of course comes with miso soup and a salad.  Love the salad.. Dressing is spot on! The bento is $11.50 and for the variety you get..the value is all there. We also ordered a spicy salmon maki, which was yummy and I liked how they added cucumber which made it little more crunchy.  So good!   Don't expect anything fancy but if you are craving sushi at a reasonable price.. Try this place out. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The sashimi and sushi are fresh and the service are good. During lunch hour, the service is pretty efficient. If you know what you are ordering, 30 mins is good enough."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi restaurant! A new favourite location as its away from the hustle and bustle of the Heartland shopping area. Average but still good veggie tempura. The chicken fried rice was beautifully plated and tasted delicious with a little spicy kick! The sushi party tray is always a great choice if you are sharing sushi at the table. Handsome presentation and a plentiful maki variety. Everything was delicious and each ingredient was top notch, nothing skimpy at all. Service was superb, fast and welcoming. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place so much. The fish is so fresh. Everything tastes good. Worth to come and try it by yourself..."}
{"text":"Good fresh food, with a lot of options. The customer service is great as well. Definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"Food was really good . Every thing was fresh and tasty . Definitely recommend the sashmi !"}
{"text":"This place is still awesome. I have eaten in the restaurant many times now and I continue to order take-out for work regularly.  Food and service is great. I'm in LOVE with their Sashimi. It's always so fresh and delicious.  The option to create your own Bento Box is pretty great. Everything I have ordered I have enjoyed."}
{"text":"Another hidden gem in Mississauga! After seeing the great reviews here on yelp, My boyfriend and I decided to pop in and fulfill our sushi cravings post workout -_-  It was a thursday and it wasnt busy at all, in fact we were the only ones there, but that didnt stop us! I ordered their bento box 3 different dishes to choose from. I chose the sashimi, chicken wings, and the maki and sushi. The boyfriend ordered the sashimi platter.  The sashimi was fresh! thats an automatic 3 stars! my chicken wings were small but crispy and cooked perfectly. I love japanese dressing on my salad so no complaints there! The service was great! The waitress was very kind and it was nice having a conversation with her about food and travel.  The place looks clean, decor looks nothing special. I really like that they have a TV and its playing the japanese cooking travel show. It just enhances craving for japanese food!  Overall this place is a great for a sushi fix without putting a hole in your wallet."}
{"text":"I have to disagree with many as this place is not the best Sushi place in Mississauga at all nor is it a hidden gem. First of all the portion quantity for the price you pay is not the greatest. Second of all Chicken Teriyaki is suppose to be grilled / broiled and they fry their teriyaki? At least mention it. Thirdly the quality wasn't on par for the price I've paid.   However I do have to give them credit that their customer service was great. The lady who took my order was polite and very helpful.    If I was to pay this much I would rather just go to Heart Sushi and eat as much as I can and more variety."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very polite and friendly staff.... The place is clean with nice ambiance. It's located in a commercial/industrial plaza, unlike most restaurants, but it's definitely worth to find it.   I had fried California roll... it was really well prepared, fresh and delicious. Definitely looking forward to go many more times  :-)"}
{"text":"Great sushi, Great service and great prices. Definitely recommend. It's tucked away so you may miss it but it's definitely worth the trip. I love coming here for lunch. Service is fast and the food is fresh."}
{"text":"I always get the veggie platter and substitute the Japanese radish with mango;  muuussstttttttt have!! Love this place! Location is hidden in the industrial area. Small, clean, nice place with great staff. The owner is a sweetheart and gave me an avacado plant lol #forevercommitted"}
{"text":"Found this place thru Yelp and glad I did!! The restaurant is located in a very uncommon area, but it is definitely a hidden gem!! The food is VERY good and the prices are very good as well! Came here for dinner but would definitely like to come back for lunch as well. Everything that I tried was very delicious and the portions are very generous. Still plenty of things I would like to try on the menu! On top of all of that, the people were very kind/friendly, and the service was great! :) By far one of the best sushi/japanese restaurants in Mississauga, and i've tried almost every sushi joint in the area. Make sure to check this place out, you will not be dissapointed! And dont be fooled by what this place looks on the outside, because its whats on the inside that counts :)"}
{"text":"Good sushi, great service, and very reasonable prices. I come here often for lunch and for under $20 I get a lunch meal and a roll (6 or 8 pieces) on the side. I leave very full and content. The staff is friendly and on my third visit I felt like a regular. I wouldn't go too out of my way to eat at Kura but if you are in the north end of Mississauga then I'd highly recommend this place over the other - fancier, more expensive - Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"I work down the street and was so happy to see a restaurant opening in this industrial park. There are very few food options available unless you want to drive, which I don't.  I ordered the Sushi, Sashimi & Maki Combo (19 pieces total) for 11.95$, and had a really hard time eating it all. Served with miso soup and a salad, this combo would be perfect for two people to share. My favourite part you ask? The sesame seeds on the outside of the rolls. Now, I know this is a strange thing to identify as my favourite, but they were incredibly flavourful.   The staff was very attentive and polite and offered to give me some menus to bring back to my office, which I gladly did.   The ambiance was lacking, plain tables with even plainer chairs, but the music was awesome, instrumental, peaceful and hummable.  Recommend to anyone working or passing through in the area. Not the best sushi I've have ever had, but really good. Would be great for a casual lunch with a client, or friend."}
{"text":"I was quite hesitant in going here 'cause of its industrial location.  It's not nearby, but rather located just North-East of the Heartland area in the city, amongst where a lot of manufacturers/large companies are located.  The parking lot was also rather empty and I don't feel comfortable dining in empty places, but I thought that I'd give it a try since I drove all the way out there.  Atmosphere:  Clean, albeit slightly diner-y, Top 40 radio station playing.  Not upscale, but at least it's warm.  Menu the same as online.  No surprises there.  Ordered:  Deluxe Dinner (22 pieces, $14.95), Salmon Maki ($3.95), & Salmon/Avo Maki ($4.95).  Slightly cheaper than my usual place, Hinote, BUT rolls are smaller.  Everything was fresh, better than I expected.  It did take some time to arrive to the table, but there is 1 guy making the rolls.  Plus I give more allowances to small businesses.  A sweet, soft-spoken Asian man runs the place.  He says that he's been open for a year with little-to-no advertising.  Would not hesitate to go back if I was in the area!  Tip:  A kettle of tea is $1 and another $1 to refill.  Not too bad considering they use loose leaf sencha."}
{"text":"Went to this place this past Saturday. The place is standard..nothing special decor wise. The people were nice and welcoming. My bf ordered the deluxe with various types of sushi and sashimi. It was delicious and the fish tasted fresh! I ordered the chicken teriyaaki and it was not enjoyable. It looked great but the chicken was tough and chewy. The vegetables were not bad but a bit cold. I will not be returning to this place as I have had better teriyaki elsewhere."}
{"text":"Location/service: I have been meaning to check out this sushi restaurant for awhile now but keep forgetting because it is tucked within an industrial area. I wasn't too hungry that day so I decided to get takeout since I was in the area to just try out their sushi/sashimi. I arrived at around 1pm and the parking lot right in front the restaurant was full, but you could park further but you will need to walk a bit. As soon as I entered in, the staff greeted me and took me to the side to peruse the takeout menu. Not to my surprise, the customers were mainly those who work in that area (based on the way they were dressed). There were many tables in restaurant and about 3 working staff and a chef who does the sushi at the counter.   Food: I ordered the deluxe dinner ($18.95+tax), which comes with sashimi (6pcs), sushi (6pcs), spicy salmon maki (3pcs), dynamite maki (4pcs) and avocado maki (3pcs). I am pretty sure they don't use the traditional Japanese or Korean rice because the rice on the maki was not sticking to the seaweed. It kept falling off. It was very soft and not like the rolls you would get at other Japanese restaurants. The sushi and sashimi were fine overall. Tasted average. Nothing too special. Of all the different things I ate, the spicy salmon maki was the best. Overall, the food was mediocre at most and considering the price of the meal (over $20 with tax), I didn't think it was worth it at all. I don't think I will return even if I am in the area next time."}
{"text":"Quiet place prbly since it's hidden in an industrial area, this place would definitely get more business if it were in a more fitting and popular location!  Firstly, the people who work there - especially the woman - are so lovely! They were welcoming, took the time to ask us how we found them, how we liked everything and seemed genuine when they said that they'd hope to see us again soon ^^  So when we tried the food and found that it was just mediocre, I was bummed! We ordered the Maki Dinner and the Sashimi, Sushi and Maki combo. Both were reasonably priced and well portioned. But the tempura in the sushi was soggy and the sashimi didn't taste fresh. Frankly, there are just better sushi spots in Mississauga :(   Maybe we'll come back again and have better luck with a bento box."}
{"text":"Other reviewers are totally right - this tiny sushi restaurant is in a rather odd location. It's somewhat off the main road and hidden inside a light industrial office park. I'm guessing much of their business comes at lunch and in the form of take-outs after working hours, as I was the only person in there around 6:30pm on a Wednesday.  The inside, like the outside, is no-frills. There are maybe a dozen tables, some generic pop music playing and two guys working. I tried a Golden Tower which is essentially a shrimp roll topped with mango, and a Green Dragon. Both were quite large, fresh tasting and nicely plated. I appreciate they don't drown everything in sauce - there's some piped on the plate, and you can choose how much/little you want to use.  Pricing is really reasonable too - no rolls are more than $10 and most of the standard (i.e. spicy tuna) rolls are under $5. They do offer beer and hot sake, but I stuck with tea.  If you don't mind a no-frills, no excitement kind of place, the food is solid and the guys that run the place are really nice."}
{"text":"Great service.  Good food.  I was very impressed that they took our 8 people party when they had already closed the kitchen."}
{"text":"Good sushi/sashimi deals! Bento boxes are $12.25 (choose 3 items, and it includes rice, salad, and miso soup already) Havent really tried their sushi items. They try to be as cozy/zen as possible in terms of music, lighting.. to compensate for the chairs & tables foodcourt feels. However, we did have a good dining experience. And hey! free delivery for orders $25 and above on specific areas!"}
{"text":"My three students from the last workterm chose Kura Sushi for their farewell lunch. They all have a love for Japanese food. One of them is a vegetarian.   This restaurant is in an odd location. It is smack in the middle of an industrial business area. However, it does well on a Friday afternoon.   I missed going in to the correct parking lot. It didn't help that I was following my manager who was ahead of me in his car. Anyway, I corrected that issue. He ended up parking in a completely different parking lot.   This restaurant is small, with limited seating. However, we came at noon and got two tables together for our group of eight.   I ordered the beef gyoza and chicken ramen. Both were delicious. You don't often see before in gyoza. They were tender and flavourful.   The chicken ramen was on the small size. The noodles were perfectly chewy and tasty. You got decent chunks of chicken and a whole egg!  I would come back here to try more items on the menu. The build-your-own bento box looked fantastic.   This business is family-run. There are signs that say that it prefers that you pay by cash, to reduce charges it had to pay when it comes to debit and credit transactions.  The students loved this place. I'm glad. It was a great sendoff, to thank them for all their hard work during their stay.   (195)"}
{"text":"I've been on the lookout for a good Mississauga Japanese restaurant for a while.  One that isn't some fusion hybrid that only does maki well or that it cost an arm and a leg for mediocre service.  I saw that several positive yelp reviews started to pop up on this particular restaurant and I finally had the opportunity to see if the reviews were right.  Yup... totally.  This is the real deal.  This is a restaurant that serves solid quality food, friendly courteous service, and at a very reasonable price.  I came with a friend for lunch and though the decor is a bit barren, it was a nice calm atmosphere with 2 smiling staff members.  They took cues on when to approach us as we had a started a vibrant conversation.  I liked how they didn't' interrupt us to get an order but managed to deliver a cup of hot green tea to both of us.  Once we both ordered, the miso soup and salad arrived quickly.  This is your standard fare and nothing too exciting.  My friend ordered the $11.50 lunch bento box where she could select 3 offerings to make up her custom order.  I ordered the lunch sashimi special where 16 pieces was only $13.50.    Within a reasonable time, my friend's bento box was filled with 2 freshly cooked selections and 1 maki roll.  On my plate, I had 6 types of fish and each were cut cleanly and a decent portion each.  They were attractively arranged as well.  My friend really enjoyed the chicken curry and also the maki roll.  She did like the Japanese beef as well with it's gingery bite but the flavourful curry sauce with a good dose of coconut milk made the best impression.  My sashimi pieces were very tender and not one of them were still frozen or chewy.    It's not a fancy place but it's a great spot to grab good quality Japanese food at a very reasonable price.  The lunch menu is a steal compared to other places in Mississauga.  Considering how close it is to all the offices on Hurontario, I think this would be more packed.  For now, it's my little hideaway!"}
{"text":"Sushi was ok and that's where I'll leave my three stars. Wait staff was great and very attentive. Unfortunately, the sushi was average and didn't make a lasting impression."}
{"text":"Really yummy fresh food and sweet staff. She always makes us feel comfortable. And the make your own bento box cannot be beat. My friend has the steak and it was Cooked to perfection"}
{"text":"Great food for a decent price. My husband and I are regulars here and I've never been dissapointed with any of the choices I've made, where as the hubby always gets the Oyako-Don. Also, the waitresses are so welcoming, nice and accomodating, which is probably why we keep coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The beef and egg don is awesome! And for lunch, it's very inexpensive. The sushi is also very well prepared. The staff is friendly as well. We will definitely come back often."}
{"text":"Decent food at best. Maybe it's because I heard they were supposed to be really good but I didn't find the food amazingly fresh. The rice used for the sushi also wasn't sticky and flavourful, and seafood was alright, not fresh. A little disappointed, but at least I know now. Restaurant was also dead and our server forgot our water. For an a la carte there's plenty of fresher and better options."}
{"text":"So I got take out from this place and it was average or just below average.. maybe I have high expectations? I've been to Tons of sushi restaurants that were amazing and I haven't reviewed them because I didn't really know about Yelp at the time.. Anyway, this is what I ordered:  Sashimi: (Butter Fish a.k.a White Tuna).. It was okay.. it was a bit stringy and somewhat grainy, seemed semi fresh  Seaweed Salad.. I always get Seaweed Salad at a sushi reatauarant, simply because it's one of my favorite salads.. although I had better seaweed salad.. I enjoyed the salad the Most out of all the items sadly..  Miso Soup.. I liked it, it felt heart warming and it wasn't overly salty. Balanced very well actually  Salmon Teriyaki Dinner (Comes with rice and Veggies and Onions) I didn't really like the Teriyaki sauce.. it was sort of bland and boring and the Salmon was over cooked and flavorless! I had to add salt to my Salmon Teriyaki.. I couldn't believe it.. anyway, after I added salt it tasted decent but they shouldn't over cook salmon (it did have the skin on the side of the fish, maybe that's why) either way, salmon is very easy to make (I make the best Salmon) so yes I have high expectations in terms of Salmon, lollll me and the word salmon. Anyway, it was okay, I don't think I'd come here again though..  I had the dragon unagi roll and spicy tuna maki roll.. it was BLAND! I've had better sushi but this place isn't bad, I just know where to go for better options.. The customer service is Amazing, very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, which I like because I always like to ask for recommendations, just in case I want something different."}
{"text":"Definitely a great spot!  Tucked away in an industrial area, it's easy to miss this hidden gem. Sashimi quality and selection is amazing, you can't believe the price they charge!  The owner was very helpful and patient even when me and my picky friends made special customizations to our orders.   The $11 bento box was a steal! You can build your own, adding anything you want with soup, salad, and rice. I'm not a big eater and I can never finish a bento box but this was just perfect."}
{"text":"Finding a good a la carte sushi restaurant in Mississauga has been a real challenge for me. Majority of the really good ones are way too overpriced while the affordable ones lack in quality. But after trying Kura sushi I think I found a go-to sushi spot from now on.  Location is crazy random where you would never expect a restaurant to be located.  We were the only ones at the restaurant when we entered in. The menu had a fair selection and I really appreciated that they had a vegetarian section too. What did catch my eye was the \"build-your-own bento box\", which required you to basically choose any 3 items from a list of selected choices, and only for around $12! So my plan was to get that, consisting of 2 portions of the sashimi and 1 teriyaki salmon. Once I mentioned this to the server she completely refused and said that I cannot get two portions of one item from the list, which I found really odd. It seemed pointless to argue so I ended up getting the Chirashi. My brother got a veg roll and soba noodles.  When I did order the Chirashi I mentioned that I do not like the fake crab meat, so to please leave that out. The server replied by saying that the Chirashi will come with an assortment of fish and I WILL get 1 or 2 of the crab. So basically she refused to omit the crab! This got me a bit frustrated but I decided to ignore her inflexibility.  While waiting for the food a few customers came in but just for take-out. The food arrived and I was happy to see that they did in fact leave out the crab meat. The portion size for mine was a bit small for me, but the taste and freshness made up for it. The soba noodles was well received by my brother. So other than the 2 situations I enjoyed my dinner here and will make it a place of choice to fix my sushi cravings for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I don't know if the owners are Japanese, but it felt that way.  I appreciate that they took their time to make my food, but DANG, a woman's gotta eat.  Hurry up and feed me sushi...please?  I do like that it has that \"hidden gem\" feel, but the reviews on here overhype the place just a tad much.  It's in the middle of an industrial area...and since it's the only sushi place...and one of the few restaurants in that area...I guess that is a wise financial move.  Their lunch rush game must be strong.  I wouldn't say it's the best sushi house in town, but I like the ambience.   They ran a Japanese food documentary on the television while I was there, so it all the more wet my appetite."}
{"text":"Sushi here is so yummy and fresh. Really enjoy the spicy salmon here. The people who own it are super nice and friendly as well. It's usually isn't packed during dinner time/late evenings. Debit and cash only!"}
{"text":"Sushi was delicious, the delivery service was fast and the staff was very friendly. The Golden Tower roll was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, service was ok. Nicely greeted by a lady. Forgot to give us sticks to eat. The menu was full of choices. At other sushi places, we get free soup and green tea. This one doesn't offer anything."}
