{"text":"Dismal atmosphere, looks like a seedy bar. Food is terrible and the service is mediocre on its best day. They used to have a lot of university students come in during the summer nights but business has been taken by nearby competitors that offer better services. Don't expect anything special from this bar/restaurant."}
{"text":"Being a fan of lots of Gabby's restaurants, was there looking for some good pub food. Was extremely disappointed. Chicken fingers were dry and crusty. Service average, did not make up for the food. Would never return to that gabbys."}
{"text":"The perfect hotspot for crappy food and not enough servers on a busy night. Patio has a scenic and charming view of a gas station. I do tip my cap to a relative who at 29 managed to go home with a 19 year old and get away without paying his bill. The police outside on Fridays and Saturdays waiting to pull over drunks is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Gluten Free and in Newmarket!  My parents live in Newmarket, so wanted to take me out to a place where I could have a choice of things to eat.  Gabby's has a pretty impressive Gluten Free menu:

And even gluten free beer!

I'd come back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the Notice of Distress and padlock on the front door says it all.  Goodbye Gabby's..."}
{"text":"I had a coupon for this place and have been curious about this place, it seems to be a chain so I thought it would at least be acceptable, but...

If you somewhere with inexperienced staff and food that comes out not even close to the description in the menu then this is the place for you. I ordered their breakfast that came with scrambled eggs, crispy strips of bacon...Instead I was presented with fried eggs, sausage and back bacon? They couldn't understand why this wasn't okay... Seriously?

I really wouldn't bother with this place. Its just full of people drinking and watching the game, wouldn't go there to eat."}
