{"text":"Are you a poor and hungry individual who is looking to fill their stomach?
Well look no further than this pizza shop. This establishments definitely caters towards quantity over quality. Prices are extremely cheap, however the quality of the food you will receive remains much to want."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch on a break from touring the nearby Carnegie Museum (1/4 block away). The pizza was very good, not gourmet, but what you'd find in a really good pizza shop. They toss your slices back in the oven for a few minutes until it gets a nice crisp on the bottom. Two slices and a drink for $5.99 as of this writing. Really enjoyed the pizza. Lots to choose from. See the menu pictures. Definitely a good place for a quick lunch bite."}
{"text":"Maximum Flavor might not be my favorite pizza shop, but if I want some food fast and cheap, they're the place to go. I'm always amazed at just how cheap the food is there, clearly the poor college student is their target. That said, the food isn't bad, I'm actually amazed at the variety of cheap, unhealthy, average quality food that they serve there (everything American and more). Here, 10 bucks could feed a few people, which is nice sometimes. They also have plenty of free stuff, provided you spend a certain amount, so if you get a few people together you can save quite a bit and get even more. Maximum Flavor is more like Maximum Bang-For-Your-Buck, make sure you go with friends for added value."}
{"text":"Good pizza at low prices. Nuff said"}
{"text":"The $5.5 for 2 slices of pizza and a drink is perfect for the cash strapped student. I found them to be well made. You also get 1 free refill on the drink."}
{"text":"Overall, this place gets 2 stars because of the people working at the counter/phones. Pizza is a solid-3-stars good, and slices are LARGE so maybe even 3.5... prices are adequate.... It gets 2 stars because of the 3-4 times I've been there, they get less and less friendly each time. Particularly 1 \"gentle\"man who makes the pizzas up front... Today i asked about something on the receipt. He first didn't understand the question and when i clarified he acted as if I was the biggest inconvenience in the world. Incredibly rude and annoyed-seeming. His attitude rubs off on the girl at the counter who seemed like she could have been friendly but working with that guy all day probably made her unhappy.

Pizza is good and sadly its the only place nearby my dorm."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing prices. Definitely our family's pizza place!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Joe rocks as always!! Tasty Sandwiches and amazing pizzas..Reasonably priced for the amount served!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I have to give this place a one-star rating.  This is hands down, one of the dirtiest restaurants in Pittsburgh!  Seriously, the owner really needs to clean this place up!"}
{"text":"Kids loved it. Great stop if you're starving and looking for something relatively cheap and quick! It's right across the street from the Carnegie Natural History Museum and surrounded by coffee shops and other food shops. Cute little college-y area."}
{"text":"\"Maximum Flavor\" should be renamed to \"Maximum Food\" instead. The helpings are huge, but the flavor is minimal. You can get a lot of chicken nuggets for $7 (24 to be exact.) 

There are numerous deals at this place, so if you need to feed a group of you for some evening gaming, this is probably the place you want to go. There is seating, but this food seems more suitable to taking back to the dorms, as the restaurant gets especially crowded during lunch. Don't expect anything to be healthy. Except maybe the side salads- those contain some noticeable vegetables.

But this place is not about being healthy; it is quintessential college food, smack dab on college street- Craig Street- straddling Pitt and CMU's campuses. Overall, the food is mostly fried and contains everything the obesity epidemic is probably related to. But hey, if you're broke (as we all are in college and post-economic collapse) Maximum Flavor is Maximum Payoff for your hard-experiment earned cash.

Added Note: Campus Food handles deliveries for Maximum Flavor."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give this place over star... Cold pizza and incredibly rude service... Not to mention the below par cleanliness of the establishment... The owner was unnecessarily mean and looked pretty dirty himself... Diners beware"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt, but alas, it wasn't meant to be.

Supposedly this was their first night in delivering on their on and not using a delivery service.  When I placed my order I gave my name and number so that when they arrived I would be made aware.  After a hour of waiting I called back to see what the hold up was since we were told a 30 minute wait.  When I called, I was informed that I didn't leave a number.  Hmm, wander what number they wrote down then?

The food was less than stellar as well.  As a whole we ordered a wide variety of items to see what the food would totally be like.  Collectively we decided the food was meh.  I personally ordered a cheeseburger and onion rings.  I got a hamburger and a few store bought onion rings.  My colleagues picked items from gyros to hot dogs to Stromboli.  All said they had better.  Maximum Flavor might be false advertising.

One thing that was good about it was that after such a long wait we got our order for free.

$3 delivery fee."}
{"text":"Maximum Flavor Pizza is slightly falsely named.  Nothing here really has maximum flavor, but it is maximum cheap for the area.  I frequent Craig St when I am starving between classes, and Sophia H. and I tested this place out.

I ordered a slice of pizza and jalapeno poppers, which came to a grand total of $5.58 with tax.  The slice of pizza was ok and super reasonably priced.  The poppers were not so good, and I would not order them again.  My recommendation is to stick to the slices of cheese pizza for a cheap and filling meal!

Service was a touch gruff on our visit."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 i would. I work on a college campus and was unable to leave my desk. So I called a friend and they said they would pick my food up for me. Great.... I have eaten here in the past food is ok service is always rude but for the price I try them. So I call to place the order and the guy is rude from the start. Very short with me didnt understand what I was attempting to say. So then I asked can I pay with my card now and someone will be in to pick it up for me. He says I dont know how to do that this is a new system. I say well is there someone else there and he say he is the only person. I say ok and hang up. He calls me back and states I \"dont have to be fucking rude then hangs up. I call him back and asked well if I was going to have this delivered how would you take my payment then. He says very rudely and laughing \" We dont deliver\". Not sure if this is new ownership but this place has gone downhill."}
{"text":"I was surprised that this place had so few reviews, given that so many people order from this place. I guess it's kind of on the cheap/trashy side in terms of restaurants. Anyways...

Maximum Flavor is all about copious amounts of cheap, unhealthy food. $5.95 gets you a double cheeseburger, 3 chicken tenders, and a soda. None of the food is what anyone would ever call gourmet, but it's quite decent. Ideal drunk food."}
{"text":"Very solid pizza delivery place. I'll point out that it is an Asian pizza delivery place. They have pizza egg rolls. Similarly to the delivery Chinese places, you can get a free item with an order over a certain size.

The prices are very affordable, especially considering their prime location on Craig Street. It's clear that they made and priced the menu with the goal of one-upping all of their competitors by pricing everything just a little cheaper. Every pizza comes with a free free drink. Gourmet extra-large 18'' pizzas are $12.99. You can add free vegetables to hoagies.

How is the food? It's really pretty good. This is not the How Lee of pizza delivery places. The pizza isn't Mineo's, but it is decidedly better than Vocelli's or Domino's. The only real complaint I have is that they don't make their own Italian dressing. It's the yellow kind."}
{"text":"I think Maximum Flavor Pizza Shop is a bit of a silly name for a restaurant/take out place but the more I think about it, the more it makes sense.  It's quirky.  This is a place with character and no frills.  Definitely no frills.

Located on N. Craig Street in Oakland, within a block from the Carnegie Museums, a slight jog to Carnegie Mellon University, and surrounded by Pitt, it is in a prime location.  But I bet a lot of people don't even know it is tucked in here.  Maximum Flavor is small, but there are a few tables so you can eat in.  

I'd call it a pizza place but there are basically a zillion menu items ranging from a gyro, to a fish sandwich, to a hoagie, to yes, pizza.  Lots of items, and again, no frill.  

The manager (or possibly owner) is full of character and quick wit.  He adds some nice to charm to this little spot.  I enjoyed everything about it.  And I like that it isn't trying to be fancy n'at."}
{"text":"The pizza combo is value for money (@ $5.50 with 2 slices of pizza and a drink). Try their Indian style burger (Vada Pav) - It's great!"}
{"text":"The prices are reasonable, and the option to get a 16 inch sub is certainly attractive after working up an appetite (or forgetting a meal), but the pizza here simply isn't that great.  There's not much a pizza parlor can do if the pizza isn't good."}
{"text":"Awesome Pizza at a great price. 
Hospitality wise also I was very satisfied. Worth going !"}
{"text":"I wouldn't say the pizza has maximum flavor... but it had a nice thin crust, with really good texture... overall, not very flavorful... I probably wouldn't get the pizza again, but I'd definitely try the hoagies and other sides."}
{"text":"the name, Maximum Flavor, in and of itself is a really goofy name for a pizza shop - or any restaurant. That said, it really is false advertising - the pizza was terrible... pretty much mall type pizza. Serving were big but a lot of bad food is still bad food. just sayin'"}
{"text":"Tasty and cheap food. Tried their cheeseburgers, loved it (I prefer fast food cheeseburger to burgers in fancier restaurants). Pizzas are good. Fried appetizers are strongly recommended. Their chicken nuggets are SO good. So fresh! I once bought 40 in a day and finished it with a friend. Also onion rings :)

Boss is pretty nice and very proud of his food. Chinese drinks available in the fridge (I think one of the co-owners is Chinese), I will recommend you guys try some if interested.Not the cleanest restaurant, but sitting down and eat didn't cause me any sickness. 

Price is fair compared to most other options on S Craig. Just don't eat it everyday for health concerns."}
{"text":"Oh Heck yeah the banana pizza raps just like my favorite rapper,stfu go to a real talian place"}
