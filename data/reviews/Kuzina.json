{"text":"The food was really good!!!!! The service was REALLY bad! Took forever, no apologies or even realization that they were doing a bad job. Won't go back bra cause of it!"}
{"text":"Kuzina has become our favorite neighbourhood restaurant which says a lot given that 17th ave is outside our door and there are so many good choices.   We love the warm welcome we receive when we arrive and the great service continues throughout the meal. The food is exceptionally good. Prepared with care, great experience and consistency.  We have tried nearly everything in the menu and have too many favorites to list so we simply ask to be fed and are never disappointed.   If you want a real treat try Kuzina you will be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Nice decor. Service and appetizers were very good. But the entrees sucked. My \"lamb chops\" were slabs of some kind of rubbery meat with a little bone attached. Pre-seasoned, probably frozen crap. A stew dish contained the same marinated/frozen meat that was advertised as braised. i.e. it was shredded rubbery meat. Also a fail. Server was not at all surprised when entrees were sent back. Avgolemono soup was thickened salt water with a little egg and lemon flavour."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I were walking around 17th Ave when we came upon Kuzina.  Looked at the menu they had outside.  I was craving a burger and noticed a feta stuffed burger.  So we decided to try it out.  The server Carrie Jean (hope the name is right) was FANTASTIC.  She was friendly, polite, funny and went above being a server.  If you want great Greek food, then check this place out."}
{"text":"Overpriced, terrible service and two of our 5 orders came out undercooked, and one of those was chicken!! Waitress was not helpful and didn't seem to know the menu at all.  Owner or manager tried to make up for the food by bringing free dessert but damage done. Wasn't impressed with my meal at all but at least was cooked.  I've had better food at Opa! for a quarter of the price."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks after they opened and WOW! Calamari was fresh and perfectly cooked (definitely not greasy). Good wine selection, not huge but nice wines. Spanokapita was delicious. Greek salad was fresh and perfectly dressed. Chicken souvlaki was wonderful. Our server was great, knowledgeable and friendly. We finished off with some of the best dessert I have ever had, phyllo, custard & cinnamon, paired with greek coffee. Fantastic job Kuzina! we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The first time our waitress spilled the water was no big deal but around the 4th time things were getting kind of ridiculous especially because they were charging us for the spilled water. Although the food was alright the service was nothing to brag about. My entire party was uncomfortable from the moment we sat down."}
{"text":"We ate at this establishment last night with another couple which was our first visit. Being Greek myself, I initially get nervous when going to a Greek restaurant, due to my high expectations. Well I was totally floored with Kuzina.  They had the five elements of a great restaurant. Friendly and excellent service, ambiance, food, price and overall experience. I had the Youvetsi which was the best I ever had and the others had the Kleftiko which is a braised lamb shoulder.   The service was way above par and the owner/chef came out and spoke to us for a bit. He was incredibly friendly and so was the rest of the staff. I have to say that this for me, is the best Greek restaurant in the city.  I will surely be going back for pleasure and for business occasions."}
{"text":"Wanted to go for dinner with friends and decided to go for Greek. We had a fantastic evening! Food was great. Service was great. Nice decore. What more do you need? Definitely going back and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Terrible service, mediocre food. Servers mumble complicated greek words when they bring the food so everyone ended up with similar looking meals that were not theirs. I asked three people before I was able to speak with the manager... not sure if the first two servers didn't understand English or what. While minor bugs/glitches with a new restaurant are understandable, this was a huge giant fail."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best and fanciest Greek restaurants I've been to!  The restaurant is spacious, modern and well decorated, and the service is superb. They even have a little wine cellar they can take you on a tour of, if you'd like!   But the best part about Kuzina is hands down, the food. Their meat platter as well as their lamb - are all out of this world! Delicious and great portions presented beautifully. Their trio of dips (tzatziki, taramosalata and aubergine dip) are also really really good. You can't go wrong with their saganaki either!  Kuzina is easily one of my favourite Greek restaurants in the city!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times. Great service and incredibly delicious food!!!"}
{"text":"Our office tried this restaurant because of their postcard that came in our mail.  We're so glad we tried it - we're all going back!  The food was fresh and the prices were what I would expect for a lunch menu.  Most of us ordered their \"Business Lunch\" for $20, which included an appetizer, entree and dessert, as well as a non-alcoholic beverage and bread.  The decor was cozy but modern, and there was parking behind the restaurant, which is a plus when going to a restaurant on 17th Avenue.  I would happily go here for dinner, but be warned, you'll need a reservation if it's on the weekend."}
{"text":"I don't know how they survive the 17ave rent ,, I never see ppl go there tbh Food was average Service was pretty good tho Interior is pretty good too  I wouldn't go back tho nothing too special"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! It's very nice inside and in a great location on 17th Avenue. We had 6 in our party and nothing left on our plates!! I had the featured lamb shoulder kleftiko with Greek salad and roasted asparagus. It was delicious, probably the best I've had! The saganaki was awesome too!  I will definitely go back here again!!  I saw a few bad reviews on Urbanspoon (one by some douche who \"grew up on Greek and has been to Greece a lot\" who didn't like the food - I don't trust Douchy reviews!) in fact I don't know how anyone could rate it less than a 3 or 4. It's a good restaurant and not a hole in the wall like most of the Greek places in the city."}
{"text":"This place was completely empty on sunday at 4pm. Literally the only guests in the restaurant on a weekend. We waited over 30 minutes to get our food. Ordered two pita wraps, one chicken and another lamb.  That said, the food is pretty good. The lamb wasn't quite medium as I ordered, but still tender and flavorful. The fries are crispy without being too greasy, and the side salad wasn't overdressed.   I'd give 2 or 3 stars on sheer waiting time, but being the only ones in the place, I assume they were not ready for us. For that, I'll ignore the wait and give 4 stars."}
{"text":"Loved this placed! Food was delicious. It was fantastic having such a variety of gluten free options to choose from. The staff and service was wonderful. I felt like I was eating at a friends place. Recommendation for wine was amazing. Loved this place and how accommodating they were to our last minute booking change and our baby who joined us for the meal."}
{"text":"Great appetizers and good wine... I had a good time in the patio here, the service was very friendly as well.. I would go back, as I'm a big fan of the Greek wine and Greek food..."}
