{"text":"Love this neighborhood family owned deli/market. Good customer service. I get what I need quick and fast. Their prices are slightly marked up but that is to be expected due to the location and the convenience. I been coming for a couple years now but they have really changed the place up. They just started making breakfast sandwiches too. They have hookah and a great wine/beer selection so I am in there at least three times a week. I would def recommend this place. I like sitting on their patio to have a sandwich, smoke hookah and have a nice cold brew."}
{"text":"Obviously the best thing about a convenience store is the convenience of it all.  I like looking into my fridge, saying \"oh, I need milk\" and being able to walk a block away and get my milk.  It's close to several apartment/condo complexes so I'm sure I am not alone in my sentiments.  Is there a premium?  Yes, there's a bit of a \"convenience store\" mark-up. They sell Otis Spunkmeyer cookies (so try to find out when they're fresh), which I always enjoy.  They also sell Boar's head deli sandwiches, Egyptian tea and an outdoor patio, none of which I have yet taken advantage of.  At one point they advertised hookah but I don't think they do anymore. Hodge podge?  A little bit.  Well done?  I couldn't quite tell you yet.  They currently have a facebook page but not an independent website."}
{"text":"Not that well stocked to be a real convenience store. A very very good craft beer and wine store. A tiny bar too. Dude at the counter was super friendly and helpful."}
