{"text":"Let me first off, state that I live in Toronto, where the Korean foods are much better than in Calgary and Edmonton on average.  The foods are generally ok.  The owners and employees are rather friendly.  Their kimchi jjigae (kimchi stew) is definitely above average.  Their side dishes are ok, and I'd not say great.  Generally, the foods are good.  The Seafood Pancake that I ordered was burnt, I ate about half of it, didn't feel like finishing it.  I'd not order this again.  This seems like a recently opened place, and they try hard to give good service.    The location is close to the airport.  I stayed at a hotel near the airport, and this was probably the closest Korean restaurant from my hotel (Homewood Suites).    My mom ordered bibimbap. But it was a bit blend, but ok to eat.  My sister ordered soondoobu jjigae (tofu stew), she thought it was average.    Any in terms of location-wise, it's convenient.  You don't have to go to downtown for decent Korean food.  :)   The decor is ok.  Fireplace in the middle of the serving hall was kinda nice...    Again, if it wasn't for the burnt pancake, they would have gotten better review.  The owner offered us patbingsu instead (shaved ice dessert), we declined."}
{"text":"Our friends took us to dinner here on Friday night and we were not disappointed. This new restaurant has replaced the Thai place that was here about a year ago. If you are craving some flavorful Korean food, this is this place to go!   There is plenty of parking (It is located next to the very popular dim sum place, tpot). The restaurant is larger in size with adequate seating and very nice decor. We had excellent service throughout. The owner was very friendly and took the time to tell us his recommendations and even came back a couple times to see how we were enjoying our meal. The prices are definitely a touch higher but if you share a few dishes together, you will be very full and happy! Altogether each couple paid about 50 bucks including tip.   We ordered seafood pancake, chili garlic fried chicken, beef bulgogi, pork ribs, a spicy hot soup, with plenty of sides. My favorite was the seafood pancake, Korean fried chicken and all the meats! It was very tasty and the meat was well marinated. They had a variety of sides like Kim chi, jalapeno, deep fried zucchini amongst other delicious options.    We were absolutely stuffed but completely satisfied after our meal. If you love Korean food, check this place out. We plan to return hungry again:)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and wonderful service, friendly waiters. We really enjoyed it and we will definitely come back many more times. They have new regular customers. Love it"}
{"text":"Came for a quick lunch here and I ordered 2 items. I ordered their Deep Fried Lotus as an appetizer and for my lunch I ordered Stone Bowl Bibimbap with Beef Bulgogi and it came with four side dishes. The lotus was cold not a hot dish which I was surprised and it was a very small serving for the price. The Bowl was OK the portions were small and not enough sauce in it. The one thing going for them is their home made gochujang hot sauce which was really good! Total cost was about $25 for a bowl and lotus root. The overall service was very friendly and accommodating, waiting staff was great. Overall the price is high for what you get."}
{"text":"For $30 per person, the serving sizes and food quality are not worth the price. It calls itself BBQ, but there is no grill at the table; all the meat comes on a hot plate. The flavours were decent. For Korean food, it was definitely on the bland side. The portions were rather small for being one of the most expensive combos on the menu. There are better Korean restaurants in town, that can feed you for less money, and better quality."}
{"text":"Food here was good but very over priced compared to a lot of other places that I've been to. I can order the same amount of deokbokki at another restaurant for 10-12 dollars and this place sells it for almost 20.   Service was the one I thing I can't help but to complain about. I went with my friend and we stood inside for about 5 minutes until an older man finally noticed us, and seated us despite it not being busy at all.   After we were seated we waited for 15 minutes for him to come back and take our order, only for him to come over and literally tell us \"I forgot you were here.\" (?) Yup.   Haven't gone back since."}
{"text":"This was a Thai place before I believe and now they changed it to a Korean restaurant. The ambiance is good with very comfortable chairs- couches I would say. Server was soft spoken though she needs to be more familiar with Korean dishes. We ordered fried chicken, bibimpop (with beef bulgogi), and kimchi chigeh. The chicken was good, the bibimpop was just okay - they don't give enough sauce and no sesame oil with it. The kimchi soup was very good though. There wasn't enough side dishes and no refills of those either. I think its a bit pricey for what we got. I will probably won't come back here- though it's the only Korean restaurant I know near our area! Sad!"}
{"text":"Love the decor in here and it's setup for small and large groups with a fireplace and old chandeliers. Our waiter was polite but service was slow considering there were only 4 other tables at noon.   We weren't very hungry and ordered the chill chicken skewers to start. The chicken tasted old and was tough and chewy. Luckily it was only 2 sticks of meat for $6.   We shared the seafood omelette which had a very crunchy, slightly charred crust. It was like 9 or 10inch rice cake with bits of shrimp and squid, and green onions. It was a bit greasy but tasty with the sauce that came with it. The 2 of us were unable to finish it and left 3 pieces.  We also shared a bowl of steamed rice.  Overall, some basic  improvements would help as this place has potential to be better than what it was."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best Korean restaurants in Calgary if you already tried all in downtown located ones. Bibimbob in hot stone bowl is highly recommendable!"}
{"text":"Really friendly staff and always a good meal. Best Korean food in the north end of they city.  If you get a chance to try their lunch special it is a fantastic meal for not much money.   Try these guys out and you won't be disappointed."}
