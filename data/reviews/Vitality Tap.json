{"text":"went there daily during my layover in Calgary and they always made my day! great menu with a lot of different option. the also offer alternatives if you don't like a certain ingrediant.  my absolute favourites: so citrus drink with extra chayenne pepper and the tropical açai bowl.  will be back for sure during my next layover"}
{"text":"I was looking to buy beet juice to bring home (i.e. in a bottle, not cup). At Vitality, they happily let me order a custom blend juice and serve it in one of their bottles that they use for their on-site bottling, rather than the standard plastic cup.  Price for 16oz was $8, pretty standard for fresh, cold-pressed juice."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their acai bowls for breakfast. They are really refreshing and filling. The granola here is always very flavourful and crunchy.  It does take some time to make the bowl but its worth it.  I usually get goji berries, coconut and granola as the toppings.  I've tried their press juices before and they are also very good."}
{"text":"Came here with my colleague. Its convenient location because its in the plus 15. I got the Poke Bowl (available 11 am to 2 pm). Only protein with the Poke bowl is tuna.   The Poke bowl is $12.99 and I added avocado for $1 (1/6 of an avocado).   This is a really expensive Poke Bowl. The bowl is small and I was left still a bit hungry afterward. The Poke Bowl tasted really good probably because it had lots of sauce to it. I noticed lots of people don't order Poke bowl here. But they have a lot of other healthy options. Guessing their main theme food is toward health. Customer niche = Health cautious people who don't don't mind paying extra.   Well they do have some interesting food or snack on the shelf. My colleague got water and it was like $4.50 from what I heard from him. I was shocked. No its not special water, just regular bottle water. Definitely pretty pricy.  I liked the food. Well this is one time thing for me.   Seating is available in the +15."}
{"text":"Ever since I had an acai berry bowl in California, I've always wondered if there was a place in Calgary. I discovered Vitality Tap through Instagram - they don't open on the weekends and have limited hours (close at 3:30pm) during the weekdays so it was hard for me to ever visit.  I had a Friday off one day and after the gym, I wanted a refreshing treat - I remembered Vitality and was on a mission to try their acai berry bowls.  Vitality Tap is on 2nd Street SW, so parking can be a headache and you must pay for it too.  It's attached to the end of plus 15 so people who work in that area can conveniently make a visit. It's located just outside the food court, down the hall beside Subway. If you've never been here before, it may be hard to find Vitality, I had to ask someone. The décor is super cute and simple. They have an open cooler with drinks and healthy treats and near the entrance they sell different kinds of 'healthy' chips.  I ordered the classic acai super bowl for $9. From that, you pick 3 toppings from: granola, strawberries, mango, banana, goji berries, pineapple, blueberries and coconut. I went with granola, blueberries and mango!  There were two people ahead of me so I looked at the treats they had and tasted a couple samples of juices while I waited.  The sample juices were deeeelish! My acai bowl was in a 16oz container, topped with their crunchy granola and fresh fruit. Of course I had to snap a photo because it looked so good! I walked back to my car while munching on my bowl. I'm happy that I got the granola for the different texture and the fruit was pretty fresh which was nice.  These bowls are super refreshing and it's a great healthy treat on a hot summer day.   My acai berry bowl was good but I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to visit Vitality again because its not really convenient if you drive but if I was wandering the area by foot, I would potentially make another visit depending on my mood."}
{"text":"Normally I don't take the time to post reviews on Yelp, but Vitality Tap is everything that Calgary is missing and I felt I had no choice but to get the ball rolling and let people know about this amazing healthy option right in the heart of downtown. I'm originally from California where we have ton of juice bars, but the energy of this place is completely different from the stuck up vibes down south. From the moment you walk in you are greeted by a smiling staff who are keen to give you a pleasant lunchtime experience no matter how busy your day. The owner is also always there and will take the time to chat with you about the entire menu and answer any questions, and she is extremely knowledgable. You can tell she really cares about her customer's needs and that is rare in fast food.  On their menu they offer a food or juice for every type of person. The kind of fast food that makes you feel good about yourself, and FAST food it is! It wasn't more than 5 minutes from the time I lined up to the time I was eating even though all the food is prepared fresh. To be honest walking in I expected to pay big bucks, but the prices are really reasonable I even took some for all my coworkers to try.   One item that REALLY stands out for me and keeps me full all day (I am a regular now!) is the protein bowl. It's full of nutrients and it's EXTREMELY delicious so whoever said you can't eat good food that's also healthy had never tried Vitality Tap. The only negative I can think of is that the to-go snacks are a bit expensive, but still better than I can get at the health food stores and i don't mind paying a little extra for good quality.  Vitality Tap is a great experience from start to finish and I'd recommend it for all of my family and friends. Especially the breakfast burrito - which maybe isn't the healthiest thing on the menu but they were sure to add an avocado so I could at least pretend."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! I feel like there are more juicing and smoothie bars popping up around the city and a lot of people are getting to that whole 'juicing/smoothie' trend as there has been a lot of focus being shifted into leading a more active/healthy lifestyle. And of course we want something thats convenient and quick to pick up when we're on the go.   I feel like smoothie/juicing bars can all pretty much look the same after a while and that they all simply mix up the combinations of fruits and veggies in their drinks. I love that Vitality Tap kicks it up a notch and offers more then simply smoothies and juices, which I feel makes them stand out from the crowd. I love that they have breakfast options, salads, cold-brew coffee, sweet raw treats as well as smoothie bowls! Their smoothie bowls, or as they call it \"superbowls\", are a fun way to eat a smoothie. They blend various fruits into a smoothie like consistancy, but it's eaten with a spoon from a bowl. You also have the option of adding various toppings which just makes it all the more better and adds a different texture to the bowl. I got the tropical bowl and I added granola to have a bit of a textural crunch to it, which was delicious. I noticed that they also have acai bowls, which is the first place I've seen in Calgary.   The place itself is beautiful. I love the minimalistic design and, from what it looks like, they also sell various natural oils, soaps, scrubs and creams.   Its unfortunate this place is hidden downtown in one of those business buildings, as I feel like it's a hidden gem. If it was in a trendier place like Kensington or 17th, it would probably just blow up. I really loved it that I probably would go out of my way to get it again."}
