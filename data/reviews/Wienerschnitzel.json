{"text":"I go here for one thing only. CORN DOGS! If you like them good and hot, fresh, then this is your place. Somedays the special is corn dogs and they can be had a for a sweet price.  This is the place where us fat people get fat, straight up."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to this location everything is hot and delicious and their daily ice cream specials are a great perk! Employees are nice fast and accurate!"}
{"text":"Dined in, ordered street dogs, corn dogs, and chili cheese fries. Everything was hot and ready to eat. Quality was there, Eva took care of us and she was pleasant."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, the employee in the drive-thru is always so polite and happy. Thanks Aaron! The food is always hot and fresh as well. I will continue to come here whenever I want a quick bite to eat :)"}
{"text":"good place for lovers of hotdogs, i order today the street hot dogs and is very good, but the best for my work is expecting drive thru and its faster service"}
{"text":"Total guilty pleasure.   Chili Cheese dogs & burgers are pretty great."}
{"text":"Today my boyfriend and I went in to eat at Weinershnitzel, as we were walking in the manager was too, and he held the door open for us. As we walked to the front counter the manager started to talk to the girl behind the counter about something that had gone wrong and how everyone who worked there was going to pay for it. At this time we're ready to order, but the manager takes the girl behind a wall just so we barely can't see them anymore and continues to yell and curse at her. We decided to eat at the place next door. And as we're opening the door from the other business he comes running out of the door asking us if we were sure we didn't want anything to eat there. He knew we were there, he held the door open when we first came in, so he should have taken care of his customers and then dealt with the issue. His customer service skills were awful and his management skills were far less than professional."}
{"text":"The staff are disgusting and the owners are even worse. I don't normally write bad reviews (everyone has off days), but considering the treatment and unsanitary food that was presented to me, I felt the need to let people know my experience:  I ordered my food, made small talk with the young man working the cashier, and noticed a few of the staff handling the food with no gloves, touching their hair, scratching their arms, and one was even picking his nose (EW). I observed to see if he'd wash his hands afterwards but he proceeded to wrap food up and hand it to the customers. Anyways, I mention to this to the young man taking my order, and quietly asked him to inform his coworker about changing his sanitary habits. He sighed at me and brought over the manager, who was asking me all kinds of questions about what I saw. I guess the owner happened to be in the store, so the manager brought him over and immediately he started talking down to me. I purposely stayed quiet when I first confronted the cashier to avoid embarrassing the staff member who was picking his nose. The owner told his employee to go wash his hands and then proceeded to raise his voice at me for \"complaining for no reason.\" When I got my food, there was a huge black hair in the hot dog. I ended up complaining about it because I wasn't going to eat from there, I just wanted my money back to go eat elsewhere. The owner came back out, and gave me the hardest time trying to get my money back, so I ended up just leaving, without my money. Horrible, HORRIBLE experience. I don't expect much from fast food, but I definitely do not think that gives fast food workers and owners an excuse to treat their customers like sh*t."}
{"text":"You have to like this kind of food to like this place. I grew up with wienerschnitzel so I love it. The location is generally clean but as with most fast food the service is sub-par and the facility is so so. You don't come here for a 1st class experience so in truth I get exactly what I expect and keep coming back. I wish the workers spoke English but the junk food is great."}
{"text":"Best wiener a gal could ask for. Staff was friendly and diverse. I love seeing tattoos in the workplace."}
{"text":"im sorry to say this is the lowest review ive ever given. we ordered. the food was DECENT. But we were never spoken to. not once. the young lady at the desk was rude and it was just shocking. i dont think im going to come to this one again. this was a one time thing and have never been to any of their locations. but i wont be going to this one"}
{"text":"Roaches in the bathroom! Yuck. Everyone is super rude, and the entire order was a mess , then when we asked nicely for it to be fixed the guy rolled his eyes. The same man that laughed with the staff while he made our drinks around the corner........ Can't imagine what that was....."}
{"text":"Ok I know this is by the college and just fast food but now with Angus Beef Hot dogs you gotta try this place. Took my family of 4 there for lunch cost $21. The dogs are great, daughter loved the 99 cent corn dog and strawberry lemondade. Yum, quick and cheap when you gotta eat on the run."}
{"text":",Great service thank you Adrian, We drove from Laveen to eat here  Great food fries on point and the best hot dogs   .........................   .................."}
{"text":"Fresh, fresh, fresh!!! bomb.com it took a few minutes but it was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Grew up in southern California and use to love this place.  Was really disappointed with the food and especially the price.  I'm done."}
{"text":"So I haven't been to Weinerschnitzel in a long time, they have a lot of deals right now including 5 for $5 classic chili dogs and a chili dog, chili fries and a chili burger for $3.99.  I got two orders of 5 for $5 classic chili dogs for me and my friends, it was as good as I remember!  I don't plan on making it a regular occurrence but I if I am in the mood for fast food I'll remember to add Weinerschnitzel to the \"rotation\" ;)"}
{"text":"It's junk food what do you expect! I don't eat there much when I do in only really like there mini corn dogs. The reason they get 2 stars is cause it takes them 10 mins for a drive through order that is with no one ahead of you."}
{"text":"I've been eating \"The Schnitz\" for most of my life now and I dont think that there has been a location that I've been to, that I've been dissapointed in.  But because this one is the closest to my house, I shall review it.  I have never been told \"we're out of that\" at this location.  The two guys that run it, \"know me\" and always greet me with a \"how have you been or where have you been?.\"   They work quick and my orders are always on the mark. They may take a lil longer to pump out the order, but thats because they dont heat lamp any of their food, so its always fresh."}
{"text":"We came as a dine-in and the cashier taking our order is the same one taking the drive-thru orders, so while ordering our food we kept getting interrupted. We went for the classic hot dogs and (unknowinglt) they since added a new beef hot dog which we picked. We weren't given the option for cheese so we received shredded cheese. After realizing the all beef all hotdog wasn't the original, we asked and were told about the original hotdog was different so we ordered another hotdog and also asked about the cheese, we were told it was the original cheese was american sliced cheese (in which we weren't given that option). So after we finally thinking we got our \"original\" hotdog, it had some bad tasting wheat bun??? Yuck... we were disappointed with the changes and won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"This place is crap... Food is disgusting like they make stuff leave it out for god knows how long then they try & reheat it & serve....the service is lousy they take FOREVER even on just ONE ORDER! I'd rather travel the extra distance to the 1 on E Charleston...."}
{"text":"The best chili cheese dogs ever grew up on them in Cali now here in Az still awesome oove them"}
{"text":"Although the staff was friendly, the food was not worth coming back. The chili was extremely salty and the shake had a weird metal aftertaste. It was a waste of my money and I had to go find something more edible elsewhere."}
{"text":"Lol, I am probably the only person in the world to give Wienerschnitzel 5 stars. But, I could care less. I love this place! Call it childhood nostalgia or whatever you want. There is nothing more comforting to me, than a Chili Cheese dog. It just takes me back to a special time in my life of being innocent & carefree. They taste the same as they did when I was a kid. The amazing combination of the perfect bite; the soft slightly sweet bun, mixed with the somewhat spiciness of the chili & that wonderful gooeyness of the American cheese intermingling & just having a good old fashioned food orgy in your mouth   I kind of wish they would bring back the Bigfoot Chili Cheese dog. Although, I would never be able to eat 3 of them in one sitting like I used to. Ahh, the joy of being young and having a bullet proof stomach. I do like that Junkyard Dog hot dog that they have now; it is pretty tasty.  To the one reviewer that is trying to compare this place to Tommy's; I'm sorry my friend, but there is no comparison. Tommy's chili is way too salty & more of a paste, as if they had thickened it with peanut butter. Sorry, but nothing will ever be as good to me as Weinerschnitzel, IMO."}
{"text":"What can I say, another West Coast gem!   I grew up with this place & have always loved the chili cheese dogs ;) Anyone from the West Coast & Southwest know what I'm talking about. You either love or hate this place. & I for one love it!! They always have great deals too. Like 5 for $5 chili dogs!   Oh & by the way, you can thank me for inventing the chili cheese fries back in the early 80's, long before they ever had them ;) Except I invented them with the American cheese, not Cheddar :P"}
{"text":"Great food the chili is great. Service was fast and inexpensive, loved them for 50 years."}
{"text":"Surprisingly wonderful Chicago dog. It seems kind of silly to not think of wienerschnitzel for a hot dog. But I usually always resort to (or get forced to go to) ted's or sonic (really now?). Their angus hot dog is wonderful. Very tasty and juicy. The toppings were abundant. The bun was nice and fluffy and didn't get soggy. At least give them a shot and compare them to Ted's, sonic, and thirsty dog. This place beats all of the them."}
{"text":"This is a practically brand new restaurant.  Very clean and efficient.  You haven't had a Chili-cheese dog until you've had Wienerschnitzel.  Today I tried their new \"Sea-dog\".  Its a deep fried fish filet with lettuce and tartar sauce on a hot dog bun.  It was very good.   This restaurant also has the Tastee-Freeze ice cream for sale as well."}
{"text":"If I could give less I would. In drive through, three cars ahead of me one behind. Waited over ten minutes. Finally car behind me backs out so I can too. Go to Mc Donalds next door get food and pull around and two of the cars ahead of me are still in line. Super poor service. How hard is it to throw a dog on a bun?"}
{"text":"Several months ago swung by for several hot dogs and three orders of fries. Went through the drive thru and when I got home my order was short.   Drove 20 min back to the location and was lucky enough to get attitude from the night manager ( Martine ). He was disgusted that I was angry about the situation. I finally just gave the all the food back and asked for a full refund. He took the food and balled it up and slammed it into the trash can by the counter.  He made sure to bill me for the coke I forgot at home. Horrible customer service from this member of their management team.  The worst part of all, I contacted Wienerschnitzel 24hr customer service later that evening. The rep was very sorry for my experience and stated she would pass it along to all parties. She informed me I would be contacted as well asap by an operation rep. Three months later not even an email.   Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"I basically told the guy I only had like 7 bucks in my bank account until tomorrow and he hooked me up with everything I could afford. If that's not customer service I don't know what is. I took his word and tried the chill cheese fries burrito never having before and it was great. That dude is the mvp of my day for helping me out. I can't remember his name and my receipt says a name I don't know but he was the only man working that I could see. But honestly I've been going to that location since it was made and never had bad food. But that guy should be teaching people how to work."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing but sadly, customer service is totally lacking . We had the misfortune to have Marina M as our cashier today. She was very rude and unpleasant . This was my husband first time so it took him a little longer to look at the menu and she gave us dirty looks and kept sighing along with rolling her eyes. Is that really needed? My husband just returned from deployment and I thought he would really enjoy something special and different but the employee made us feel as if we were wasting her time and that she had better things to do. The food may be amazing but the lack in hospitality makes us never want to come back here again ."}
{"text":"I always have wonderful and speedy service ! Elias was very polite and made sure my order was correct. Nothing makes a pregnant lady happier than good food , great service, respectful and polite employees  !  I live closer to the tbird location and I always manager to come to this location because I know I will always get wonderful service"}
{"text":"Some days nothing hits the spot like good old junk food.  Today my meal consisted of an all beef dog with pastrami and two chili cheese dogs. Im not on this side of town so much now days, so the feeling was like visiting a dear old friend. I definitely noticed a price increase over the old days, but hey, they have to make a profit to stay open, besides they do often or always have special offers.  Everything was fast, hot, correct, and better than you might expect for any restaurant with a drive through attached. The dining area was cleaner than most fast food offerings as well. Needles to say, I left full, and happy. Good job people, there are a lot of high scale places that can't get it right."}
{"text":"I ordered a hot dog. Surprise. It's hard to review a hot dog. Let's see there was a bun. It wasn't soggy. There was a frank and chili on top. It was ok. I ate it. In a pinch, I'd go back."}
{"text":"What is there to say .. it is a chain so the quality of the food is going to be the same everywhere you go. I have to say though these people have never messed up my order at this location ..the food is always consistent!"}
{"text":"I love it the best chili cheese dogs I ever had.  People are kool over there too.  Like Julio and Berlin..............."}
{"text":"Sorry night shift closed the doors at 10:50pm and the sign says 11pm. I asked through the door what's the deal they said only the drive throughs open late. Mean while they are looking at one another asking should we let them in? What great customer service..... Wish I could leave my job 10mins early all the time..."}
{"text":"Tell your drive-thru guy to pull up his pants!  I don't need to see his blue underwear while he hands me my food.  Maybe tell him a personality is pretty cheap to come by.  No \"Hello\" or \"Thank you.\",  you know, the basic customer service etiquette every other establishment requires.  This is a \"right-to-work\" state;  you don't like your job... you can quit and get one you would like!   Oh yeah..... Food was great as always!"}
{"text":"Food is decent and consistent. Never had any issues so far, and they have some great coupon deals for their items, which is a big plus.  However, like another reviewer said,  the woman who works at the drive thru is extremely cold, rude, and unwelcoming. This is the ONLY fast food place i've ever been to and had someone who worked there act like they are doing me a favor by asking for my order, and doing their job.  Also, you cannot help but wonder when people like this are working there, that if they are messing with your food if you happen to \"make them upset\" or catch them on a really bad day.. LOOK OUT!  I only go here because the food, the deals are great, and because it's close to where I live, but if I had a choice for another wienerschnitzel near by i'd avoid this one just for the attitude of the woman working at the drive thru."}
{"text":"I had the chili cheese dog  and  chili cheese fries both were great. fast service and people we nice. if you like chili dogs try this place I will be  back!!!"}
{"text":"One of the cleanest fast food places I've been in. Staff very nice and efficient. Did I mention CLEAN?!  hard to find these days. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"First time trying Wienerschnitzel. Nothing special to be honest. I've tasted better chili dogs, hot dogs, and burgers from a circus. I guess the best item I had is the chili cheese fries."}
{"text":"This place has been my weakness since childhood. I still get food from here once a month or so. Probably the only fast food place I visit often, other than Five Guys when I lived on the east coast. If you're preparing for a trip to Mexico, just dine here once a week for a month or two before your vacation. You'll probably be introduced to much of the bacteria of delicious real-Mexican street food.  Perhaps it's not that bad, but it is delicious. Especially their \"pastrami dog\". You can be a self-proclaimed \"foodie\" all you want, with your \"oh, ha! ha!, but I admit that I do on the occasion dine at the selected In-N-Out\" pompous asshole who thinks you're still down-to-earth, or you can come down and gorge on some real disgusting, real fast food. What are you afraid of? Your arteries will expand enough to still allow the blood  through, don't worry. Sure, they may drop your hot dog on the ground and forget to use sanitary gloves from time to time, but how else are you going to break in your immune system, you sissy?"}
{"text":"This place is a Sunday after church foot for us. Always clean. Always great service and the food is what it is supposed to be.  It's cheap hot dogs, and being a Cali grown kid that are the best.   The same lady works in the back and she makes certain we get the right food every time.    Like this spot for sure."}
{"text":"Chili cheese burgers and chili cheese fries!!! Yummm yummmm  dont expect to come In here and have amazing food! Its simply fast food.. But good !"}
{"text":"Back in the day Der Wienerschnitzel was consistently cheap at its very many locations but there aren't too many around anymore and you gotta be careful with your order and use coupons to eat at the prices its quality would mandate.   Corn dogs are still 79 cents all the time, chili dogs are 99 cents only after 9pm without a coupon.  The manager is the owner or is paid based on sales as he is kinda stinky about the coupons.  You do have to double check your bill and order \"properly\" because the specials & coupons won't always ring up right and a combo won't be a combo unless you order it that way.     It is clean, clean, clean.... it MUST be an owner/manager.    Don't forget to ask for onions with the chili dog... who would ever dream you would have to do this?"}
{"text":"Still the best for dogs, grab a bag on the way home!  Good prices, better than any fast food place!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money.  If you're in the mood for a hot-fudge Sunday I recommend McDonald's.  For $2.65 I should have gone to Dairy Queen.  Seriously lacking in the fudge department and the excessive amount of whip cream simply took up space and melted away before I even got home.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Hire people who want to work and are not a joke! Every time we go to this location they always say the ice cream maker never works???? Really? Every Thursday and Friday for six months? And what is ridiculous is they try to cover for each other when you ask as to why it isn't working and when?  They are bad liars and bad hires. Look at your numbers owner and how much cash you really pull in? Our team use to go there but now we no longer do. FYI the hot dog buns are cold and hard!"}
{"text":"Once again, we love going to this restaurant because they have the family deal that you can not beat if you are hungry for hot dogs. They have the 5 for $5 deal. Can you beat that? I don't think so!! The family and I love chili dogs, so of course we are gonna go here!! YAY for Wienerschnitzel!! This time, we went to the one that is in front of Las Vegas Outlet. YYYYYAAAAAYYYY for chili dogs!!"}
{"text":"Really didn't impress me. Place is clean. Chicago Dog was just lame. Chilli fries were cheap tasty but and okay place to go."}
{"text":"I love going to this restaurant because they have the family deal that you can not beat if you are hungry for hot dogs. They have the 5 for $5 deal. Can you beat that? I don't think so!! The family and I love chili dogs, so of course we are gonna go here!! YAY for Wienerschnitzel!! They are in the plaza of Walmart and Sam's Club right next door to the L&L Hawaiian BBQ!"}
{"text":"Food was fast and excellent.  The staff was unbelievably friendly. I highly recommend this location to anyone looking for some good hot dogs."}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants that I had never actually seen until I moved to Arizona.  It was one of those mythological places that I always heard or read about.  Then I try it and find it's not so mythological but it does the trick.  I have eaten at Wienerschnitzel a few times since moving here.  It easily surpasses the typical fast food joints.  I'll eat here over McDonald's or Burger King or Taco Bell any day of the week.  The main drawback to Wienerschnitzel is that it's still a typical fast food joint.  Here in Tempe there's other options for dogs that are much better.  I can hit up Ted's or venture into Mesa for a Sonoran dog at Mickey's.  Still, I do visit Wienerschnitzel because it's close and I love eating at a place called Wienerschnitzel.  As pure fast food this is a good place to check out."}
{"text":"I was telling a friend about my singular experience with Wienerschnitzel, and she reported similar feelings, so I thought I should warn others about my experience.   I ate at this location once when I was in high school, before I became very health-conscious, and it was a very memorable experience because it was so unpleasant.  I can't remember exactly what I ordered, but it was one of the hot dogs with onion and peppers on it, which I remember were overly greasy, soggy and limp.  It looked like gelatinous mush.  There was no pride or integrity in the way it was put together.  I don't know how to describe the taste exactly, but I clearly remember that it didn't taste natural or right.  It tasted unnatural and wrong, like is was tainted in some way.  For some reason -- I guess i was hungry and didn't want to waste my money -- I ate the whole hotdog.  I remember feeling queasy afterwards, like my stomach had been insulted and abused.  That was the day I made a personal vow never to eat at Wienerschnitzel again, and I am reaffirming that vow today."}
{"text":"Great food. But getting too expensive.  Drive thru a little slow. Bring back green River soda . It's some good stuff. Employees are great and pleasant"}
{"text":"I wish they would use the hot griddle again. It always taste like the hot dogs have been microwaved. Plus buns are moist more wet like. So ask for non steamed buns. Love it in California so much better."}
{"text":"I am really picky when it comes to hot dogs, but I did enjoy the ones they have here. Granted, I have only been able to try it once so far. But my experience was a fairly pleasant one even though I'm not crazy about their fries. I'm sure I'll be back sometime."}
{"text":"Got the 5 for $5.55 deal but it turned out to be 4 for $5.55. Please teach your employees how to count."}
{"text":"I find it strange that people like this place. The food is not good at all. I adore anything chilli cheese..and all of their chilli cheese stuff is pretty gross. I can make better hot dogs at home. I only keep coming back for their ice cream and lemonade float. Yum. But I really dislike the food. I've tried everything on the menu and have to keep coming back here..my favorite food is the jalapeno poppers which are delicious. I just buy a bunch of those."}
{"text":"Customer service is top notch.. The evening crew is always courteous and the prices of the dogs keep making me come back. The deluxe dogs and Chicago dogs I crave are always on point. Many thanks to the staff."}
{"text":"Da bomb & everyone is super friendly.. The food is always hot and I am never dissappointed. The staff here is also pretty awesome and customer service is top notch."}
{"text":"First time eating at a Weinerschnitzel and I'm glad I did!  I had the chili burger and chili cheese dog combo, and it was fresh and tasty.  The service was also fast and friendly.  I went through the drive thru so I can't comment on the inside of the business."}
{"text":"good experience on my last visit.  I don't like pork or hot dogs so it always makes my friends laugh when I want to go here.  I like the chili cheeseburger and chili fries...guess I like the chili!  haha last visit though after ordering I had to answer a phone call so was at the booth on the phone while waiting for the food.  the manager (who took my order) brought my food out to the table, didn't expect that.  it's a fast food restaurant, so little things like that go the extra mile! only thing that sucks for me is I hate Pepsi products and drink diet sodas, so the only option besides Diet Pepsi is fresh brewed ice tea...wish there was something else like a Diet Mountain Dew or something."}
{"text":"I don't have much to say about my greedy, lazy, overworked ass have to say but......My fries were really fresh but extremely soggy!!! Everything else was truly fulfilling but I'm a potato girl and I love my fries but I was disappointed today.   I appreciate them trying to give me great fast courteous service but I wouldn't mind at all letting this fries cook just a couple more minutes longer.  Will I be back??? HELL YES I'LL BE BACK!!! Their service alone will always bring me back. They had a little hiccup today but we all do Sometimes."}
{"text":"Wienerschnitzel ... what can I really say.    Well, the drive-thru staff was very friendly.  5 stars on service.  Food ... well, a bratwurst with kraut, fries, Coke and a shake ... how good could it really be?  Well, the fries were good. Why yellow mustard, not brown? 2 stars.  Now, my problem on this visit ... they must have been out of napkins. However, they made up for it with hand towels (the hard white ones from a bathroom?) I was driving, mustard dripping down my face - what do I do? I wipe my face ... cool?  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO - the hard \"napkin\" hit my eye and cut it! :((((( Yes, ouch!  Avoided an accident - next day to the eye doctor ... my eye was sliced!  Maybe my fault ... why? Because I should have never gone to Wienerschnitzel.  Lesson learned."}
{"text":"This place was a huge disappointment.   My wife and I stopped in to order two chocolate sundaes. The guy at the register didn't crack a smile and was quite short with us.   He prepared our sundaes under the watchful eye of the owner. Both sundaes were well below the level of the already small cups and when he put the tops on the sundaes it looked ridiculous. The size of the portions (almost no whipped cream and very little chocolate) was laughable and you could tell the owner was taking full advantage of the smaller portions to garner a larger profit on the sale of these \"Tastee Freezes\".   This wasn't enough abuse though. While we were sitting there you could hear shouting in a foreign language in the kitchen area (not Spanish or English) and loud jabbering in some foreign dialect from the far east.   Bottom line: We spent $2.89 per sundae and got about seven bites of ice cream for our trouble.   We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Seriously, I just gave this Wienerschnitzel 5 stars.   Drive-thru at 9:30PM ... Ordered ice cream from Taste Freez ... Car waiting for his order in front of me - employee walked out to my car and brought my ice cream to me. No waiting.   Excellent service."}
{"text":"This location gets 5 stars from me came here not too long ago to pick up a bite to eat got to say the workers at this location are friendly and go out of their way to provide you good service. The food here is fresh and which is lacking at a few fast food places and overall I like this location and I might make a trip back here again when I'm running an errand or two."}
{"text":"I grew up with this California-based chain.  For me, a polish sandwich with kraut is comfort food.  I have to eat here at least once every couple of weeks.  You should to.  Interestingly enough: you can buy a chili dog, a chili cheese dog, a chili burger, a chili cheese burger, but you can't buy a bowl of chili."}
{"text":"I live a good 10/15 minutes out of town, but whenever im close by I always have to stop by. I decided to go and order a bacon ranch chili cheese fry. Let me tell you, this is the best one they offer. The ranch mixes so well with the chili. Its like heaven. Food was tasty, but the drinks are a little expensive... wish they were cheaper! Staff is super friendly. I see the same guy with the tattoos there whenever I go and had a nice chat with him. I think his name is Jacob. Really friendly staff. Restaurant was clean. Food was quick, and tasted amazing. If you're ever craving something... unique.. id suggest visiting this central Illinois speciality. Supposedly the closest Wienerschnitzel to this location is in texas!"}
{"text":"I don't even know what to say. Worst chili cheese fries I've ever had. I opened the box and didn't see any chili. The hot dogs were very loosely wrapped, so all the toppings fell off/apart. There were also a few details that were missing on the customer service front. The cashier didn't tell me how much the total order was when I was done ordering, didn't ask if I wanted a drink, etc. I know this is a fast food place but come on. There needs to be a sense of service and at least some quality."}
{"text":"This place has literally the worst customer service ever. First thing is, the drive-thru always takes forever and then when you get up to the window to pay you EVEN longer. Fast food? Not fast enough apparently. Second thing is, their door says the dining area is open until 10pm on sunday and the Drive-thru is open until 11pm on sunday, I went there on a Sunday and got there at about 9:20. Both were closed and they had all their lights off, when I pulled into the parking lot I saw the employees through my headlights and they hid after I saw them. Seriously? Show some professionalism. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here with my family it's a great experience is so amazing, the manager here Is so welcoming and nice,  he makes sure everyone is taken care of, they also  give coupons out...."}
{"text":"'We can't tell anyone about this\" said my buddy as we pulled into the parking lot.  I agreed wholeheartedly.  Then we pulled up into the drive-thu.  I have not been to a Wienerschnitzel since I was a kid.  I had fond memories of it or so I thought.  My brain as I grow older often fails me and what I thought was something....was not.  Ordered up some truly toxic but tasty chili dogs.  I even ordered up one that was wrapped in bacon.  This took me back to my days roaming intoxicated around TJ.  But because of health codes, I knew this one was much safer.  The employee was extremely friendly as they completed our order and handed us our food.  We pulled into a secluded are of the parking as if we were doing something illegal and started our afternoon feast.  When it was all said and done I was briefly taken back to my youth, but the wrappers and churning in my guts reminded me that no adult should probably be eating this stuff."}
{"text":"I came here some weeks ago to try their food , I got a street dog and a bacon burger  and a sundae . The hot dog  was good I just wish the burger was tastier ... but their customer service was good. Very affable people  I will come back for more of their hot dogs"}
{"text":"John the man working the counter here was as pleasant as possible,  making sure to check in on us during our meal. He even brought us out free samples of birthday cake ice cream. He definitely made the lunch one to remember!"}
{"text":"Mmm, wieners.  Ok, ok, get your mind out of the gutter.  I had one of those moments today where all taste, class and health concerns go out the window.   I have to satiate my primal desire sometimes, and I'm not afraid to admit it.   Can't be classy and healthy all the time, right?  Wienerschnitzel = part guilty pleasure and part nostalgia.  I wanted hot dogs today.   No holds barred.   With runny salty chili.   With cheese.    No Hebrew National.   No Vienna Beef.   No gourmet German sausages. Too bourgeouisie and yuppie.   I wanted cheap and klassy (with a 'K') today, dammit.  Regular wieners.  Pork lips and filler.  Bottom of the barrel, baby!  Does it help that there are ONLY FOUR Wienerschnitzels in the entire Valley - thus increasing its exclusivity and appeal?  WTF?  Does it help that this location is very close to the office?  NO.  I love me some chili cheese dogs and chili cheeseburger (the #5) from Der Wiener.   When I'm feeling especially naughty, up for the challenge of major indigestion and knocking off a few days of my life expectancy, I'll add chili and cheese to my fries.  Not so today my friends.  I decided to draw the line, much to the chagrin of my warped desires.     Mmmm, burp.  Thank you Wienerschnitzel.  And thank you Rolaids."}
{"text":"The employees were so nice! They saw that we had dogs in the car and gave us an extra hot dog for them to share. Great service!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Growing up in Southern California I would eat this often and still do. The 5 chili dogs or corn dogs for $5 is a steal. If you have them add cheese then they steal from you so take my tip and bring your own kraft singles from home people! .40 cents per dog adds up! The pretzel bun is good too. They have daily specials on the taste-freez goodies."}
{"text":"Not to much to say about this place. It's pretty much what you expect from a chain hotdog joint. I paid 5.32 for a hot dog and a drink...I would rather spend 5 bucks at Safeway on a pack of 6 and cook them myself than eat here again. But I guess its a nice alternative to McDonalds.."}
{"text":"Very rude and the owner wow he just stood there and so did the employees while I waited to order this place sucks BAD SERVICE"}
{"text":"The staff here is bar none the most energetic and happy people to be around. They make dining here all that much better. Plus the original chili cheese dog is my all time favorite hot dog."}
{"text":"I was sure glad a Schnitzel came in local... we used to go to one in Flagstaff and got hooked on the Kraut. It is not too sour and cooked just right. Wish I could do as well....My son loves the chili cheeze fries....but oooh man does the family have to suffer afterward... if you get my drift! Or HIS...ha-ha"}
{"text":"Well organized. Personally I love the parts is parts chilly cheese dogs with plastic cheese. Childhood memories may make me a bit partial. So you may want to steer clear if your vegan, are concerned about bodily functions, etc... but if you are just your average man with a hankering for a messy dog an a large Pepsi, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"My hopes weren't too high- it's a hot dog chain, they have good prices, and I was in a frankfurter mood.   Hit up the drive thru and service was quick but a bit brusque. Received my 2 mustard dogs for $2, and went on my way. As I unwrapped my first dog, it rolled out of the wrapper and splattered mustard all over my work outfit. I wasn't trying to juggle the darn thing, I wasn't multitasking, it was a disaster. Even the second one, which I was more careful with, was a gigantic mess- mustard everywhere. I don't understand what the staff is doing with the wrappers if the mustard is getting all over the place.  Also, even for $1, my expectations were a little better- when you specialize in a niche product, it should be better than what I can get for the same price at a gas station. It's not. The junkyard dog will still be my go-to, but I'll be hitting up another location to get my fix... somewhere that won't require me to do my laundry after getting a simple snack."}
{"text":"9 corn dogs 2 large fries took 15 min & counting. At least we were offered a free drink for the long wait."}
{"text":"It's an ok place if you want to grab something to eat, but unfortunately the bathroom is disgusting! They need to remodel that bathroom asap! I feel like I'm inside an abandoned building."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and hot! We have 2 kids and only 1 got a kids meal and the girl was nice enough to bring our other son a toy!! Would come back next time we are in town!! Very clean too!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu tastes average. Their corn dogs are amazing.. but the chili leaves a lot to be desired. It's consistency is goopy and very gelatinous.. and it's not the most appetizing. The restaurant is clean and they have daily dessert specials that are fun especially for kids."}
{"text":"Been going to \" Der Wienerschnitzel \" since 1975 in Texas. Love their chili dog, kraut dog, and the deluxe dog, which is similar to a chicago-style dog. You have a choice of two types of wieners. I think their fries are way above average for fast food.   Easy access off Thunderbird on the north side of the road. Love to eat outside and bring more home to have later. Affordable food, good service.  Update: they have added a chicago dog to their menu, and the difference between the deluxe and chicago dog is in the relish, bun, and added sport peppers."}
{"text":"Your Dining At Wienerschnitzel on Higley:  Better to dine-in than carry out. If someone orders a burger you're gonna sit and wait in the drive-thru for a while. Better not to have their burgers, they're tiny, thin, and over-priced. Their angus hotdogs have higher fat content than their regular dogs.  Their fries are mediocre.  May I recommend their Chicago dog and Kraut dog with mustard. Well worth a stop. Sometimes I get a bunch of 'em for a few days in a row at work, 2 per day. They hold well in the fridge and warm-up okay in the break room microwave. Quick and easy.  Been a customer of Der Wienerschnitzel since 1975! This store is above average for speed and cleanliness. And no, they do not serve wienerschnitzel which is something like a breaded tenderloin."}
{"text":"I started eating at \"Der Wienerschnitzel\" about 50 years ago.  If I recall correctly, WW2 had just ended (LOL).  My German teacher used to say, \"Nein Nein Nein.  Ist nicht \"Der\", ist \"Das\".  Who cares, right?  I just love the food.  Tonight I had a delicious Deluxe Dog all beef.  This used to be called a \"Super Dog\" in the old days of yore.  I also had a delicious Polish Sandwich, although my Frau forgot to order mine mit Kraut.  Oh snap!  It was still very delicious.  I like the little cardboard boxes (environmentally friendly) the dogs come in now.  In the old days, they were wrapped in tissue type paper and leaked all over you.  \"Uh, no, I didn't wet my pants.  I ate at Der Wienerschnitzel!\".  Still great after all these years unless my memory isn't working - what?  I forgot what I was writing about so I guess I will go now!  Enjoy eating your wiener!"}
{"text":"First review ever for any restaurant. I can't hold back on this one. So dissatisfied.  I ordered 2 chicago dogs and upon unwrapping them, both looked like they had a cup of water dumped on them immediately prior to bagging. I just can't even comprehend what actually happened. The bun was completely soggy and gross and it literally squeaked once when I bit into it because it was just all juice.  One sport pepper on one of my dogs was more red than it was green (wtf?), and my tomato was about 80% rind and looked like it was sun-dried during peak 110 degree hours today.  I'm mindblown that the dude at the drive thru even had the balls to serve these things.  Portillo's is right across the street. Never go here for Chicago dogs. Ever."}
{"text":"I love this spot!! Been there forever, but it's still clean and up to date!! Flat Screen TV even!!! No place nearby w/acceptable Hotdogs/Corn dogs for miles. Glad this one is right down the street :) Those Tastee Freeze's are amazing as well!!! Gotta try one if you haven't!!!  Staff is pretty friendly as well. I've had a good experience each time there this week..."}
{"text":"Never go through the drive through again!!  10 mins to take a damn order and 10 mins to make the damn food!!! And 5 mins to get a large soda!! COME ON!!! The only reason why I'm giving it a 2 star is because the hot dogs are really good. But other then that. My recommendation...don't go through the drive through....go inside to get the food. At lease you will be in an AC building."}
{"text":"Sign says drive thru is open until 11. Went at 10:15 and sat in the drive thru for 10 minutes and no one even answered the speaker. LAME. First and last time I will attempt this place. On my way to Sonic!!"}
{"text":"Ok, we stopped in for their \"special\" which is 3 chili burgers, 3 chili dogs and 3 small fries.  We asked if we could substitute and get 2 chili burgers, 2 chili dogs, 2 corn dogs and 3 small fries.  The cashier said he didn't know but would enter it to see. Good news!! Yes, all of that for $9.99.  The food was honestly only 3 stars... Which of course is just basic... Not bad, not great.  The reason for the 4th star is the shift manager TONY.  He was very personable, checked in us 2 times to see if we needed/wanted anything else.  Mind you, this is a fast food establishment.  The counter area was immaculate, the dining area was SPOTLESS, the floor was clean and the restrooms were very clean.  Generally when a restaurant is this clean it is a direct reflection of management and their commitment to having a well run shop.  Hats off to Tony and his crew in this regard.  The food, as I said earlier was only so so, but the overall experience was exceptional.  We got out corn dog, chili dog fix so we probably won't be back for a while, but I wanted to share what I felt about superlative service."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 fresh banana shakes & a few food items. Unfortunately our shakes were super watery .  I wouldn't recommend buying shakes here."}
{"text":"Love the chili cheese fries. But........, The service was really slow. We were the only ones in the drive thru and no customers in the inside. It was 12:30pm and it took almost 20 min to get our food after we paid and they forgot our drink and we had to honk the horn to get their attention to get it!!"}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru about 8pm on Saturday the 28th 2015. I waited about 1 minute till someone took my order for 4 corn dogs. I waited 15 minutes in front of a vehicle and the drive thru person handed the vehicle 1 little bag. I then waited another 5 minutes at the window and all you hear is laughing and yelling, the cashier finally took my money, he gave me my change but no receipt. I then received my order and no receipt in my bag so I asked the cashier for my receipt and he scrambled around looking for one. He finally produced a receipt but the amounts were different; pretty shady.... When I got home I only had 3 corn dogs in my bag; how do you split 3 corn dogs for 4 kids?!.... So, I call Wienerschnitzel and ask for the manager and the guy who answered the phone said that the manager is off. No manager on duty is a health code violation per health department. I asked the person whom I was talking to for his name and he refused to tell me and I asked for the managers name and he said it was against company rules to give that information. I don't know the the cashiers name cause he wasn't wearing a name tag. This is bad business and I will not be coming back and I will make sure to spread the word. Keep your corn dog, I don't want my money back."}
{"text":"This will be a short review. Went thru drive thru, one person aheadbof me. Took too long. I ordered a rootbeer float with hardly any ice cream in it. I've ordered these before so I know what the proportions should look like. At least there wasnt a hair in it like the time i ordered a chili dog which is why i stick to ice cream."}
{"text":"Been craving chili dogs but, I work Grave yard shift and never seem to wake up in time to get it before work. But, found out they open at 9am!!!! Score! I bought a family pack and was able to reheat for later and they tasted delicious~~ Very happy girl and husband too.."}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant 2071 Rock Springs Dr Las Vegas, NV  89128 United States on for the Mother's Day special on 5-14-2017  Due to that I was there my children wanted to take advantage of the first student ID discount 20% off .  Wanted to order the  $15 crowd pleaser. The sign for the student ID exceptions are discount coupons daily specials or combos cannot be excepted. Due to the crowd pleaser did not state it was a combo I'm not using a coupon or is not part of the daily special I did not see a problemwhy I couldn't take a vantage of the student ID 20% off .  Due to there was no manager or supervisor the cashier call them owner of the store Said that what he said his mane was.  Cashier passed over the phone for me to speak to the owner Said . When I got on the line I introduce myself then Said started to yell at me explaining why or why not or what he say he was going to do. I was trying to talk to explain what I was trying do.   To explain myself.  I was unable to explain myself he kept yelling. I ended the conversation and I walked out of the store did not buy anything and will not buy anything from the store ever again."}
{"text":"Have always liked these guys but the service is lacking in this location for sure . Not sure if the owner knows that his staff is giving away free stuff to their friends left and right. Had some issue with trying to place an order due to the staff visiting with the friends that dropped in to get their freebies...."}
{"text":"You know what it is.   Anything with their chili is ok but you might pay for it. Their gourmet dogs are pretty good.  But I pretty much just come here for the corn dogs."}
{"text":"Ah, Wienerschnitzel. You are neither bad nor good. You fit the a-ok category perfectly. I love me some hot dogs. These are a-ok cheap hot dogs. The Angus beef ones are, of course, better than the regular ones. They cost about $0.80 more and are worth the upgrade. You can also upgrade, for about $0.60, to a pretzel bun. The ingredients aren't exactly fresh, so you are better off sticking to the chili cheese dogs than trying to get a Chicago dog or something. Their chili is nothing to write home about, but it's decent hot dog type chili. And really, how can you go wrong with covering like everything in chili and cheese? Hint: Sign up for their email list on their website and get a free chili dog. Their 5 for $5.99 deal is pretty good and will easily fill up a few people. And their new multitude of chili cheese fries are pretty tasty. I really enjoyed the buffalo bacon ones. Plus, they have Tastee Freeze. And they offer Mountain Dew. All in all, it's not a great hot dog. But it's not bad either. This will definitely hit the spot when craving chili cheese dogs. This particular location almost never has a wait at the drive thru. And they haven't gotten an order wrong yet. Though, it is sometimes easy to stump them."}
{"text":"Good price for decent food. So, I have driven by many Wienerschnitzels and never tried the food. Today was the day. I ordered their $10 special: 3 fries, 3 chili dogs and 3 corn dogs. Fries were crispy and fresh tasting. The chili dogs were decent, unremarkable but palatable. The kids really liked the corn dog which was perfectly fried and tasted pretty good. If you want a quick meal to feed the kids or are craving a basic chili dog or corn dog. This hits the spot."}
{"text":"The food is ok but service always sucks!!! Get it together. It's just hot dogs!! I tried the new strawberry lemonade and it was full of strawberry syrup. The cup was so dark it was disgusting!"}
{"text":"Cheap, greasy, tasty 'dogs.  I generally get my eats without the chili, which is a sin considering it's something they seem to take pride in.  The fries are pretty decent too."}
{"text":"Been in drive thru lane for over a half hour. Only 3 cars.  Must be making steaks!!!!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Thursday with my son Jim. We hate so many dogs and topped it off with A banana split . Service was great ! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. The girl at the register made an honest mistake. No harm there. When I got my wrong order I asked for what I ordered and was treated rudely and like I was a liar. You all SERIOUSLY need to work on your service here."}
{"text":"This particular location is a little odd as they don't tell you your total until you get to the window and for a long time the speaker box didn't work (fret not - it does now), but I always see the same lady every evening I have stopped by for food.  She's always really nice and pleasant and double checks everything.  To me, that stands out since I've been to this location over a span of several months to a year.  It can be a little slow sometimes, but they do make the food to order.  Corn dogs are a staple here so sometimes I have to wait a few minutes, but they are the freshest, tastiest corn dogs around.  Root beer floats are pretty good here, too.  Sometimes the root beer to ice cream ratio is skewed one way or the other, so if you dig that then that's cool?"}
{"text":"I ordered the Chili Cheeseburger with the 2x cheese and 3x Bacon chile fries with the Strawberry Lemonade and the best thing was the strawberry Lemonade. The fries were ok but the cheese burger wasn't that good."}
{"text":"Oh how I love Der Wienerschnitzel! I grew up as a kid coming by here on and off with my dad. He would always get Chili Cheese Fries and a ton of Chili Cheese Dogs and we'd just go to town. It's still just as good as I remember from my childhood, the bread is always hot and fresh, the chili perfect, and the deals not half bad either. This is the closest location to where I live which is at least six miles aways because they just don't build many of these, but I try to swing by whenever I can. It's not the best food you'll ever have, and it's not exactly healthy either, but it's really good, fun, tasty food!"}
{"text":"I know, I know, five stars seems a little steep for fast food place like this, but it really deserves it. You figure we rate a business based on how good it is thinking of what the best it can be is. This place always has hot, great tasting food, served with a smile and it's always fast. Super clean inside, always consistent. It's pretty much the same few employees and they start to recognize you after a while. Mmmmm just talking about them in this review makes me want to go get some chili cheese fries!"}
{"text":"Seriously great service! My hubby is the pickiest order and changes his mind so many times!!! Loraine and Beth were so awesome and really helped us figure out what we wanted and what was most popular. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Best Wienerschnitzel in Vegas!!! They are fast, place is really clean, and food prices are reasonable. Staff is so friendly and seem to be quite knowledgeable!!!!"}
{"text":"The worker Aaron is so nice, makes you feel so welcome there, and the beef chili dogs are so good, I like going to a place that makes you feel welcome and taste good. Thanks for great service Aaron.  Thanks you. Carolyn A."}
{"text":"Hotdogs were no better, in fact worse, than would come out of my microwave.  What a total and complete waste of my time going all the way out here.  Bought a groupon, as I love hotdogs.  Won't be making another trip here, that's for sure."}
{"text":"By the time I got home my food was already Ice cold...I paid for extra  cheese  & once again did not get it...my hot dog was unappealing and all over the place! This was in LAS VEGAS!!! A Vallejo location doesn't even exist! Looks like customer service dept needs to double check too!!"}
{"text":"This place is my heart attack grill! Love the food and idc what anyone says about it! Fast and friendly"}
{"text":"Good solid hot dogs with good chili. You know what you are going to get. We hit the drive through and got plenty of food for less than $10"}
{"text":"One of the worst ordering food i have ever had. Ordered 2 large fish. 5 beef hot dogs with all the chili and topping on the side. Asked to have fresh fish, & fries, and was told to park in front. After over 15 minutes i had asked a customer going into the place and see what what was going on with my order. 3 minutes later a girl comes out with the order. I asked if it was all fresh. Oh yes. Get home and fish, fries were tough & chewy, fries terrible. Chili dogs with all the topping on, and were nothing nut mush. Nobody listen to any thing you say. And lies when you get order. It had to be sitting some place for some time to be like that. Help really needs help to get some thing done right. What a waste of time & money! Nobody understands an order!"}
{"text":"Food is always hot. Tastes yummy.  Best of all, every time I have gone to this location I have received great customer service from the staff."}
{"text":"OMG I have never had this before and boy was I missing out!! The customer service was great, they were so polite to my boyfriend and I and even hooked me up! I ordered the mini corndog kids meal and they let me sub the desert pear drink for the fountain drink and curly fries for the reg fries (cause they hooked me up!) and it was the best corndogs I ever had! So impressed with this fast food! My BF got the junkyard dogs and they were super filling and good, I had a taste of the chili and it was great too! Will defiantly go back...  Best thing about this place...the desert pear lemonade drink. I am always looking for non carbonated, water substitutes when I'm out, because water and lemonade get really old when that is all you drink. This was sooo good, so so so so good! I am so impressed!  And side note they have an A rating from the Health district.  And another thing! I always order kids meals, because of the small portions (I don't eat much), but the toys are an added bonus. In recent years all toys suck from kids meals...until today! It was awesome! It's a nerf rocket!! Love it!"}
{"text":"Love the all beef ($1 extra) kraut dog. Also really good corn dog. Could go there every day!"}
{"text":"We had never been to a Wienerschnitzel before, and after this dinning experience we will probably not be coming back.  We were going to Bookmans and thought this might be a good quick stop for something other then tacos and burgers.  Watching some of the LA Angels baseball games on TV this past summer made me think of Wienerschnitzel and their 50 year celebration.  After eating here, I cannot imagine how they lasted that long.    The only other hot dog chain which I have eaten is Nathan's Famous.  Even though Nathan's has it's own short comings, they at least have a product you might actually want to eat, other than at 2 o'clock in the morning.  This is a hot dog place, plain and simple. They serve Oscar Meyer type hot dogs, though that might be a disservice to Oscar Meyer.  There is something about their Original hot dog that seems lighter, or air filled.  When I mentioned lighter, I mean that they weights next to nothing.  The bun weights more.  Combined with it's lack of taste, you wonder what you were eating.  In a blindfolded test, you would never guess.  For the record, we had couple of Original Hot Dogs, a Polish sandwich Meal deal (which was much better then the dogs), Jalapeno Poppers, Chili fries and two sodas which all amazingly came to $12 or so for the two of us.  They also charge 25 cents extra for a second ranch dressing for the poppers.  Six poppers and only one sauce?    The employees behind the counter were fine.  They were not a factor in on our decision to skip this place in the future.  In the end, it was just the food that was tasteless and uninspiring.  Admitedly, we did not try their Angus beef hot dogs.  So maybe we were missing something from the Weinerschnitzel experience.  Ehh!"}
{"text":"Thank you for contacting me but the food needs to be hot and not cold is how you can provide a service to your customer.   The establishment was not really busy. So hot dogs were sitting there for awhile."}
{"text":"they take kinda long but that is because they make sure your corndogs are fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Not a busy location at all. Stopped in for lunch and was first in line. Food came up fast and fresh. Always good hotdogs and ice cream cones here. Will be back again for a quick bite to eat for lunch!  2017 review #7"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place stays open for business. Seriously, my order was simple: two hot dogs, fries, and a Cinnabon dessert. How much trouble can this order be?  The fries had an opaque, raw-potato color, with no \"golden brown and delicious\" look at all. If fact, the fries looked as though they had absorbed the cooking oil, which gave them a glossy look. When you grab some fries to dip them in ketchup, your fingers get covered in cold grease and the fries droop and hang limp from your finger, like an al dente pasta noodle. The fries taste and feel like they were swirled around in two-week-old lukewarm oil to make them hotter than room temperature and ready to serve. Holy smokes! How unappetizing! When I asked my 27yo daughter to try the fries, she said no, the fries are always served like that and she never orders/eats them. Unreal. The hot dogs were generally uneventful, so, we move on to dessert.  The Cinnabon (normally) is a delightful, fluffy little baked treat. The Cinnabon served at this place would probably be fluffy and delicious IF THEY ACTUALLY COOKED THE THING! The dough hadn't even risen, yet. Sitting under the plastic cover of the dish were small lumps of indescribable food stuff covered with cinnamon and liquid sugar - inedible. I would LOVE to meet the owner of this insult to the consumer, so that I might explain what a JOKE the manager of this dump really is. There is no oversight to the production in this place.   Dessert was not at all dessert, in fact, it was a godsend. This dessert moved me to take the loss and rather than express my disappointment to management, I will simply never return to this disgrace of a restaurant...E.V.E.R!"}
{"text":"So you come to Wienershnitzel and you have to know what to expect! You going to pay a low price, for chili food that is slightly better than what you could make at home, served by an employee that will smile and take your order at best!   We were immediately greeted upon arrival at the register, and the cashier took our order. The food here was great, and NOT smothered in too much chili that it was soggy! Everything was hot, and fresh, and the staff brought the food to our table for us!   The establishment was clean, and looked new."}
{"text":"Food is always good and fresh.   I'm a regular customer. I been here 3 times in 2 weeks.   Today they got my order wrong.   I went to inform.  Not complain.  And they let me keep the incorrect item and made the item I wanted.  That is a damn good customer serv8ce experience.  They didn't have to let me keep the incorrect item but they did and made the one I wanted free and walked it out to me.  I didn't catch his name. But he was nice."}
{"text":"Tube Steaks, are tube steaks, right?  And like the Kaiser supposedly said, I don't necessarily want to see how they make 'em, I just want to enjoy them.  I was driving along McQueen today, near the Chandler/Gilbert border and noticed this Wienerschnitzel.  Seems CVS Pharmacy has trimmed back their trees and like many, I didn't realize Wienerschnitzel was there.  I ordered a cup of Chili ($3.49), which was good; a Pastrami Sandwich ($4.99) for later and a Polish Chicago ($3.09).  I was less than impressed with the dog, or Polish if you will.  Like most of their Hot Dogs at Wienerschnitzel, it seems puffed-up with air and less than solid in chewing or taste. Certainly not the solid 100% Beef ones they serve at Costco.  What was different though, was their introduction of Pastrami as a menu item.  Besides offering a sandwich, they put it on everything, including their frankfurters.  Go figure.  I was however not brave enough to try it on my Polish.  Maybe next time. Hmmmm   Der Fun since '61?  Three Stars, \"A-Okay\"."}
{"text":"Since I reviewed Nathan's I should review the exact opposite of a good hot dog joint.  I do love the dogs.  One day in high school, my friends and I had a day where we did stuff that we'd never done before.  One of those things was go to a Wienerschnitzel.  I didn't like it then.  I then married a man who LOVED Wienerschnitzel and would bring it home at every opportunity.  I then learned that I hate Wienerschnitzel.  I've made better hot dogs at home on my grill much cheaper.  I don't know what they do to them - mayhap I don't have enough fake German in me to like them - but they've always tasted slightly of ass and cat food."}
{"text":"Had lunch here, got a dipped cone for me son and I, was surprised how good the ice cream is. Very smooth."}
{"text":"Yup it's a wirnerschnitzel.  Sub par fast food where you go when you want a hot dog or some cheap drive through.  Not much else to really say"}
{"text":"Horrible and terrible customer service!  When I was just about to place my order, a customer just got a sundae and asked the cashier for just a little bit more fudge on top (this Wienerschnitzel had chintz him on the fudge), but the cashier (Yussell) sternly said, \"No\" and told him that it was cost him 27 cents more!  What a joke!  Of course, I was leery that my family would receive poor service as well.  My wife and I order their new Angus hot dogs.  About 2/3 of the way done eating, we realized that they forgot to put the crunchy onions on top.  When I approached the cashier, who summoned the cook, the cook was confused.  Apparently, the cook did not know that these crunchy onions go on top.  What can you do about this, since we were almost done with our hot dogs.  Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"To be honest, I only drove thru this place because a friend of mine told me they have corn dogs.   Whaaaat?! Somewhere besides Hot Dog on a Stick that serves my beloved processed meat deep fried in a cornmeal batter?! And not having to wait for the local carnival/fair to come into town to indulge in this fare food?!  I was so there.  They have a special of 5 for $5 corn dogs and although I was so tempted, I stuck with my usual 2. It was steaming hot as I drove away and dug right in. So delicious and worth the calories. I will be going back for sure...for the corn dogs.  For anyone reading this review and wonder why this would even be helpful, so what, I like corn dogs and not getting anything else. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"**update** They asked for my contact Info but never responded to my message or sent an email  First and foremost, I typically avoid \"fast food\" but I was hangry and saw an ad for their chicken schnitzel sandwich and it looked yummy. I got to the speaker to order I received \"what can I get you?\" No how are you, welcome to Wienerschnitzel etc... then the wait was really long, like 20+ minutes. Get to the window, girl still has an attitude. Hands me my food, which by the way was egregiously overpriced.  Didn't get a thank you or anything. Then my sandwich was not very hot and the fries were flimsy and not well cooked. I'm sad, for almost 9 bucks it should have been much better."}
{"text":"Their hot dogs and burgers are so good! You might think the price is a bit too much for a hot dog but it's so worth every penny. I love the cheese fries and their burgers! I love their corn dogs too but their burgers are better. It's weird but cool at the same time that they're in the same place as Subway. It comes in handy if you feel like being healthy because they even share dining rooms!"}
{"text":"Nice and clean. Teenage staff didn't goof off even though it was dead while we were there.  They were constantly wiping and cleaning and took food to customers rather than just call out their number. Good team. Food was as expected, corn dogs and fries. Not much to mess up."}
{"text":"Great service! Have not been here in years. I enjoyed my chili dog very much and the fries or even better than I expected, I love them crispy :-)"}
{"text":"Why am I writing a review for Wienerschnitzel? I guess it seemed sad that they only had three reviews to date. If you don't feel like driving all the way to Costco for a hot dog you can't really go wrong here. Keep your eye out for coupons in the weekly circular if you want a really good deal."}
{"text":"This is a family favorite that we can all agree on. We love the corn dogs, chili cheese fries, hot dogs and tasty freeze! What draws us in is the jalapeño poppers! They're spicy and you don't get a third degree burn from biting into it. The jalapeño's are chopped into tiny pieces, they use cheddar cheese (not cream cheese) and the breading is on point!"}
{"text":"The Chili dogs were hot and fresh, and the fries were so good.. hot, fresh and had a little crunch to them. They were delicious.   Con - bathroom was dirty and smelled like sewer."}
{"text":"I came in no one spoke & I felt like we were wasting their time. I would never tell anyone I know to come to this location"}
{"text":"Stopped by on Veterans Day for their free meal special. Pulled up in the drive thru and they were so nice, order complete, fast service. If you haven't had a chili cheese hot dog from here your missing out, get yourself one! But only one if your watching your in take ;)"}
{"text":"This place remains my go to spot for unhealthy gorging.  I always think it's funny when the staff brings out my food and they ask me for the third time \"Are you sure it's for here?\" A consistent product that never disappoints; I crave this place at least once a month."}
{"text":"The ice cream here is the best but a close second to Dairy Queen.  The best time to hit up Wienerschnitzel is when you score their coupons.  I love their sundaes and root beer floats.    Their food is ok but not the best but if you score coupons its worthwhile to go there and enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"Nice quick drive through when you just got to have that chili  cheese dog  yum! Thank you"}
{"text":"Ordered a chili cheese dog, haven't had one in years and yum it was amazing. Checked in while in drive thru didn't realize they had a yelp deal.   Manager was super sweet and honored the deal at the window which added fries for $1.99.   Tip: Make sure to check in."}
{"text":"It's a nice little spot that used to be a fried chicken with the same name as a muscular cartoon sailor. It's still internally attached to the convenient store next door. Great selection of all beef (and other) hot dogs and burgers. Tastee Freez desserts are also available. Staff seems eager to please. Limited parking, due to a gas station and convenience store being at the same location."}
{"text":"I haven't been to the 'Schnitz in eons. This is the first one I have been to that has indoor seating.   Nothing had changed since the last time I ate here. Still the restaurant of choice when craving chili-cheese anything."}
{"text":"I would much rather buy a store brand hot dog and Hormel chili and make my own. Dip cone was the best thing. Service sucked rude not friendly."}
{"text":"My experience here begins with walking in, looking at the menu board, going to the counter, the person just looks at me and says nothing. No hello, what would you like, so I order a pastrami dog and fries, do I want a drink, I wasn't asked. My friend ordered the fish and fries.  My hot dog had two small pieces of pastrami on it, pretty pathetic, my fries were old looking and tasted like it, I asked for new fries, freshly cooked, the person was not happy, told me there was nothing wrong with what I got. Finally got new ones. My friend's two pieces of sorry looking fish were placed on top of the fries in a small hot dog box. Couldn't believe this is how they served this. We were thoroughly disgusted with the food and this place, won't ever be back."}
{"text":"I like to call this place Wiener dog.  I don't eat often but when I do, I usually get at least a chili dog.  You see what I did there.  yes I know corny joke alert.  Believe it or not I have some friends who have never eaten here.  I was in shock!  How could you never been to Wienerschnitzel?  I always have coupons for this place and they always have specials.  So we decided to go check it out.  I can usually get a combo meal about a couple times a year.  We walked in and the guy was friendly and seemed happy to be there.  So this was plus. This is a fast food chain, so it's easy and fast.  They have pretty good corn dogs too.  If you are in the area you have to check this place out.  If you have never tried this place before, then climb out of your rock and get a chili dog.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"For years I have loved this place. Their buns are never hard. Never too much bread to dog. They are so so delicious. It's the crack you just need sometimes :D the strawberry lemonades are bees knees as long as they don't put too much strawberry syrup into it (I usually ask them to be on the light side). Sometimes a good chili cheese dog will make the day better :D their fries are boss too.   FYI: JULY 11th HOTDOGS & CHILI DOGS ARE 59 CENTS!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the SLOWEST EVER!  You go through the drive thru it takes 5-10min for your order.  If you go inside it's still a long wait time.  I don't think they care people work and are on their lunch breaks.  Hot dogs, Corn dogs, Chili, and even burgers should not take that damn long!  Complain to management they act like its nothing or they not understanding because you're speaking English.  Well I had a friend tell them in Spanish, and they still take their time.  The cashier in the drive thru male took order then went outside pulling weeds then back in the establishment!  I immediately advised him not to touch my food.  If you like this place and can spare 12-15 min  for your order go ahead.  Mac Donald's is faster than this even when they park you!  GET IT TOGETHER SIR/MA'AM!"}
{"text":"Love the Pastrami sandwich.  The staff is nice and fast. Kids love to watch the ice cream get made and what kids is not into hotdogs?  Its good people with good food."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!! First I wanted to go inside because one of my kids didn't know what she wanted(I hate holding up the drive thru) but when we walked in the inside was under construction, no sign no nothing so we piled back in the car and We went through the drive thru, everything seemed fine, good service, fast. But we were home before we realized the kids didn't get their kids meal toys and I was ok with that(less trash around the house) but after feeding everyone else I sat down to eat my food and I got way more then what I asked for with my meal. There was a LONG HAIR melted right into the cheese in my chili cheese dog, at least 6 inches of HAIR were hanging out the dog. Never again! NEVER!"}
{"text":"I got something from the menu I had never eaten from Wienerschnitzel. A pastrami sandwich. It was not good. I went thru the drive-thru, then got a parking spot to munch down a much needed lunch.   The first thing I noticed is that it didn't look anything like the photo but what food ever does so I took a bite and said ummmmm in a questioning tone not yummmm in a 'this is delish' tone. I took it back in the store and asked for a refund. The manager was livid. He began to tell me that if everyone brought their food back, that wouldn't be good for his store. I told him that I wasn't going to pay for something that was nasty and that I didn't care about what other people did. He gave me a hard time a few times which was really uncomfortable but  finally gave me back my little $4.31.   Seriously! Maybe he should have asked if they could make me something else but he chose to take it personal. Oh well. I won't ever be back to this one or any Wienerschnitzel's. I don't spend my money at places that have a problem with refunds. I will be 100% satisfied with ANY and ALL my purchases, or it's going back. Simple as that!  Pros: The drive thru girl was nice and the store looked clean and tidy."}
{"text":"Let me start out my review of \"Wienerschnitzel\" by saying I resent the fact that they dropped \"Der\" from the front of the name! In my heart it will always be Der Wienerschnitzel! That being said, I have always been a fan of this little hot dog joint. The location I frequent is on Rainbow near Oakey. The store is always clean and the service inside and at the drive thru is always prompt and friendly. The buns and dogs are good but they are basically of the store bought variety, so it must be the chili. The chili is a straight forward beef laden red with a thickish texture that keeps it from running off of the dog. It has a very distinct flavor that is unmistakably Der Wienerschnitzel. My favorite item is the chili cheese dog which have a slice of melted cheddar on them. The fries are actually very good as fast food fries go. They are thin cut and cooked perfectly crisp which makes them great for sopping up the leftovers on your \"chili paper\" (the name my kids gave to the chili remaining on the hot dog wrapper after the dog has been consumed). I can't imagine anyone out there that has tried Der once in their lives, but if by chance you haven't, you should give them a try."}
{"text":"First time here, quick service the fries and chili dog were great. Don't forget the root beer float for dessert!"}
{"text":"You could do worse in a pinch.  I haven't been to Weinerschnitzel in a very long time.  To be honest I am really not a fan of fast food.  However, if your in a rush, and the kids want a hotdog, you could do worse a pinc.  Weinerschnutzel offers a variety of food but are probably known for their hotdogs and corn dogs.  Its a great value for a group of hungry kids.  The service is quick, the staff is  polite, you're in-and-out with a bag of hot food in no time at all."}
{"text":"Came here last night for the first time because my nephew was craving a hot dog and he kept seeing this goofy commercial about some pastrami hot dog special they are running. Pulled up about 20 minutes prior to closing and after ordering when we got to the window the cashier (a guy) using a monotone voice repeated my total and kind of snatched the card. Dude I get it.. you work at a hot dog joint and you probably hate your life but please get a new job because the attitude and just extra stuff I could've done without. ANYWAYS on to the food. I don't generally do hot dogs and if I did wouldn't be from here however my nephew said it was \" the bomb\" but next time let's hope we get some better service when I bring him back."}

{"text":"Good hotdogs, burgers and fry combinations. Corn dogs always good."}
{"text":"I have eaten here probably twenty or thirty times over the past few years. It is your standard hot dog joint. I really love wiener schnitzel so I gave it a five star. Their french fries are always hot and crispy. The hot dogs are always freshly made and steamed. I really like them. I've also tried their ice cream and it is also good."}
{"text":"What would I ever do without Wienerschnitzel?  It's my holy place. My temple. My place of tribute.   And I'm not making a clever metaphor for the rise in obesity and fast food consumption.  You see, to keep in line with my religion (Discordianism), I have to eat a hot dog (or two...or three) every Friday in reverence to the goddess Eris. I'm not making this shit up. Look it up in our scripture.   I experimented for a while in finding a suitable regular source of weenie. At first I tried doing the \"hot dog cart outside of the store/bar/strip club\" thing, but after a while I realized that behind every smiling hot dog salesman is a tragic story of heartbreak and shattered dreams, and I began to fear that eventually hot dogs would begin to taste like cheating spouses and children who dropped out of med school with only weeks left to graduation.  I tried gas stations. Mobil On The Run and Quiktrip especially, because they have some of the best chili cheese dogs in all of creation. I was content for some time, thrilled to be able to fill up my gas tank while participating in a sacred ritual. Finally, religion was serving me, instead of the other way around. Life was good.  Then one day I walk into a MotR and inquire the clerk as to the freshness of the dogs.  (THIS IS A DRAMATIZATION)  \"Good sir, how long have these franks been on yonder grill?\" \"I don't know, since last night I think.\" \"I say, that's ludicrous! Have you any idea how unsanitary that is?\" \"We leave them out until their sold. They do the same at movie theaters. And why do you talk like that? Are you gay or something?\" \"If by 'gay' you mean happy, sir, then no, I most certainly am not. I am not 'gay' about these health violations.\"  Long I lingered unhappily in the desert of unhappiness where unhappy vultures feast on unhappy roadkill.  Why would my god(dess) demand I ingest something so foul?  That's just a rhetorical question, btw. In The Principia Discordia it outlines exactly why we should eat hot dogs. Eating a hot dog on a Friday violates the dietary conditions of every major religion. That's how we roll.  At the suggestion of a friend I stumbled across Wienerschnitzel, which to this day I have yet to spell correctly on the first try.  Not only do they have the best chili cheese dogs I've had in a long time, but also the best chili cheese fries, chili cheese burgers, chili cheese french fry burritos...and they also have the hypocrisy, insincerity and apathy I look for in a religious institution.  Like a Sunday School teacher who tells their kids that killing is bad unless it's America's enemies, WS has no regard for their own doctrine. Every time I visit the drive through it's the same noise. \"No, you can't substitute your french fries for a chili cheese french fry burrito. No, you can't sub out your soda for a tastee freeze.\" Yet every time I get to the counter, there's that same shady cashier looking both ways before giving me my bag and warning me that it's \"just this once\" and not to expect them to do me any favors next time.   That's the kind of \"do as I say, not as I do\" attitude I expect, no, require, from a religious establishment. I demand the same amount of two-faced clergy that is available to everyone else.  Every time I hear them say \"Thank you, have a nice day\" it wraps an invisible fuzzy, warm blanket over me. It reminds me of my youth. Of cranky, obligated \"bless yous\" that come after every sound-barrier-breaking sneeze, of every dazed and listless \"may the lord be with you\" in every Catholic service. Sentimentality is very important to me in a religious institution. I may attend this temple of consumerist worship the rest of my life. I need to be able to remember it when I'm away, eating normal people food and doing those things that reasonable, rationally-minded people do with their free time when not eating hot dogs in heathen rituals and talking to dolphins.  And apathy. Yeah. They're pretty apathetic whenever I show up. But so am I, I guess. Big deal. Who cares?  Oh, also, they charge extra for all-beef hot dogs. Which means that the lower option is made up of mystery meat. I keep hoping I bite into one and accidentally eat a demon or something.  The best part of WS is that like a small church on the side of a country road (that's where churches are, right? I haven't been to one since I attended a wedding in Waco, TX), WS has its own regulars, usually specific to each branch. Probably because with all that chili and cheese we eat, we can't be bothered to travel too far to you know, try other things out. We all laugh and smile and laugh at each other, consumed by a sense of camaraderie/mutually assured destruction.   Wienerschnitzel really does bring me closer to my god(dess).  What would I do without it?  I dunno. Eat spaghettios with hot dogs cut up in them. At the rate I'm going, I'll be lucky if I can make it to the can opener without having a heart attack."}
{"text":"I don't think anybody can do it better than the original. So many places trying to get into selling hot dogs they are never as good as Weinerschnitzel. Staff is always friendly and ready to take your order. Chili dogs and corn dogs are the best!!!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years and was craving it.  Same tiny little spot as last time.  I've completely forgotten everything about what was available which made this time 'interesting'.  I think I got a brand new guy, cuz what I ordered was simple but ended up being something I needed to handhold.  Kept asking the usual questions about the options but worded it in a way of confirming that I indeed want it.  I'm tired so yeah.  I looked and saw the price at 12 or so bucks and I had to stop it.  I only ordered a 2 chili dog combo and poppers.  Had to take off the added option of beef (worded as 'all beef, right?' From the cashier) and the drink question was 'which drink and fries, medium or large?' Which I asked if small is indeed an option and he nodded.  I felt like I was buying a used car :-). I guess I can't blame him though he's new... But still when it takes me getting loud to stop it, something's wrong."}
{"text":"omg. nice employees horrible horrible sodium-laced food...If you dont have Hypertension before you go in there You will have high blood pressure on your way out....everything looks so good and delicious until you bite into the bland items filled with salt, salt, salt....And I like salt.   this is just too much."}
{"text":"Always clean great place! I come in here with an army I have a big family this place gets down! Fresh food fast cooks Matt the manager is awesome his team is A++ great job guys will forever come here!"}
{"text":"I dropped by the drive-thru on South Higley, remembering a blast from the past during my Navy days and eating some Der Wienerschnitzel on Rosecrans Blvd. by NTC, thinking I was going to be in for a treat.  I thought wrong!  It was over-priced, and that sandwich was just really small.  The food just wasn't all that good.  The service was fine and timely, it wasn't until I arrived at my destination that I learned that once again I had been boofed in the drive-thru.  No hurry going back!  Perhaps if I really start jonesing for some chili dogs I might come back, but I'd really have to be craving them."}
{"text":"5 corn dogs for 5 bucks.......Tuesday special on Milkshakes for 1.29......Franks made with Chicken instead of Beef or Pork.....Priceless. This establishment is great place to stop after going to an NFL.....NHL...MLB....or Spring Training game because it is near all of those facilities if your head back to the East Side of the Valley. The restaurant is very clean....the staff is nice and the food is very good. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"Chili cheese hot dog. That's what I was craving. For some reason the transition to cold weather from Hawaii makes me want to eat lots of food probably to add fat for hibernation similar to bears. Anyway, this is another random snack place we decided to eat at.  Drove through and ordered me a chili cheese dog, a chili dog and chili fries for the hubs, and another dog for my mama. How the heck did I not see the 3 chili dogs deal for $3.00?!? I cut my mama off when she mentioned the deal and that's what I get. Brought it home and had a taste of that sodium and fat enriched goodness. Again, I inhaled my chili cheese dog in a couple minutes and tried to picture how it will be when I get back to working out when my vacation's over. Who cares.  I have a special place in my heart for Wienerschnitzel and its on the lines of artery clogging goodness."}
{"text":"Love it here! Reminds me of my junior high school days. Hot dogs, chili dogs, corn dogs... Great customer servicr and the retro pictures on the walls makes this place better than the rest. They play good classic rock music too. Its decision junk food that you shouldn't eat everyday, but cool to treat yourself now and then. A+++++!"}
{"text":"For a Weinerschnitzel, it don't get better then this! Service is good, food is good and location is not that bad. Overall, if you're a weiney's fan, you will surely appreciate this one."}
{"text":"If you like your doggies served hot in steamed buns, Wienerschnitzel is the place for you. Always a clean store and pleasant, fast service. Don't forget to get the 10% senior discount."}
{"text":"I was driving through the area and really craving a hot dog so I decided to give Wienerschnitzel another try.  Remembering my last visit and how I disliked the cheaper choice hot dog, I made sure to get the all beef Angus dog this time.  Much better.  No unpleasant aftertaste.  The chili cheese topping was standard cafeteria-like fare.  Fries were oily, like they didn't shake them out well before serving, but they reminded me of old school Burger King fries from back in the day (before they changed their fry recipe in the 90s)...so I kind of liked them.  All my food came out fresh and piping hot.  The employees were very friendly, and I noticed one went beyond the normal level of service to help a customer with mobility issues.  Great employee.    Better dining experience than last time.  3 stars."}
{"text":"Well. I won't give it 5 stars, but I'll go 3. Bring the alka - seltzer. As I live and breathe. For God's sake .  You might not want to eat here before a hookup. This is an \"I'm effin hungry, I want it fast and cheap \" kinda place. The kind of place where you go by yourself and eat it like a dog... if you thought I was kidding about the alka seltzer - I wasn't."}
{"text":"I always come here to get my chili dog fix!! The fries are good and it's nice and cool inside."}
{"text":"I go to this restaurant often cause it's close to my job. Yesterday I was off but decided to stop there for lunch. Ordered my food paid with cash. Sat down and ate finished said bye to a female worker who's always there when I go. She knows my face really well and was on lunch sitting behind me when I left. After I got a little ways up the street discovered I had left my wallet. Went back and no one had seen the wallet or anyone sit down where I was sitting. I never just accuse anyone of anything but within them few minutes she was still on break but never seen anything and the manager also said he swept and cleaned the table off after I had left. I'm not crazy but both are suspects if you ask me. She would not look me in my face and the manager was very hostile about the whole situation. I talked to another worker there and she said she seen the other employee with my wallet but didn't want to be involved because she work there. They stole all my personal information social security card drivers license credit cards insurance cards and the worst 840 dollars in cash that was my bill money and grocery money! The worst day of my life because I chose to eat at that classless ass fast food place!!!! They are very dishonest people the manager even had to nerve to say why would you carry that kind of cash anyway? I normally don't but I was going to pay bills and decided to stop there. What a huge mistake! I will never eat at anyone of those franchise! Oh and FYI they have no cameras in the lobby so be extra careful if you eat there! No stars from me but you have to select one to post so my rating is fuck them heartless ass bitches that work there!!! I hope worst happens to you and your lives are cursed for ever for every dollar you spent of my hard earned money!!! I'm a single mother of three and I don't get no fucking tax return bitch!! I work hard for everything y'all took!"}
{"text":"I love Wienerschnitzel, but this place sucks.  If I could give it zero stars I would.    I have been in to this restaurant 4 times and the experience was the same every time.  Rude staff.  Exceptionally rude manager.    I called corporate to complain and they argued with me, insisting that there was no Weinerschnitzel in Tempe.   I simply won't go anymore as I don't need the aggravation.  Great chili dogs but horrible customer service.  Getting kicked in the testicles would be a better experience."}
{"text":"I don't drive into Champaign often, but this was one of those times.  It was the day of my wedding and I was dropping my dogs off at a kennel on the west side of town, and I pulled into the drive-thru at Weinerschnitzel because it was close and on my way back home.  The guy who gave me my food made some nice small talk with me and I mentioned I was getting married that day.  He gave me some extra food for free and congratulated me.  It was a very thoughtful and kind gesture.    The food was good too!"}
{"text":"Fuck this place.  I was behind 3 cars, placed an order and had to wait 15 minutes to get to the window.  The lead car sat at the window for at least 8 minutes, they did not ask them to pull up.  When I finally got to the window, they had no idea what my order was, so I just left.  Fuck everything about this place."}
{"text":"Just listen to 2 workers talk shit..  in another language!!!  about a disabled vet who made a comment to them that he liked their Memorial Day sign and that's the reason he comes back..  show some respect what have you done for this country ?   I did fill them in that's because he was a vet and fought for our country."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give these guys 5 stars, but it's the price of things that made me go, \"no, I can't.\"  I've been dragged to many Weinerschnitzels in my lifetime because my friends have hot dog cravings and this one was IMPECCABLY clean. I mean, I wasn't scared. The floors were spotless, the tables gleamed, even the serving counter was immaculate. The place where food was put behind the counter was something my anal retentive self fell in love with - it was all sparkly clean, napkins piled neatly and in an orderly fashion. I nearly fainted.  I even commented on it and the guy behind the counter said, \"We want to have our customers see a clean place. Not a dirty one.\"  Much love as I do have for the cleanliness, I think they made up for it in price. No deals, nothing. I'm used to seeing a dollar menu-ish type of thing. The ones in California have them and I should know because I see the promos for them on TV here in California.  I was surprised to see that a chili dog combo (2 chili dogs, medium fries and drink) was $5.99.  I should've persuaded my friends to hit costco and gotten the hot dog, drink AND an ice cream for a little over $3.  Nice clean place, but dirty high prices for a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Once again Yelp..Update!!!! This location is not a current Weinerschnitzel, it's a Loan Mart."}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place is the ice cream.  Everything else is cheap garbage food (especially the hot dogs) It shouldn't even be called meat!  It's the same as purchasing that artificial garbage Bar-S brand."}
{"text":"Best Wiener schnitzel. I love their food as far as fast food goes. This particular one did not have nice people but they did their job quickly and efficiently and the food was hot and yummy as possible. It is sad all of them are not the same."}
{"text":"Great wieners and sausages. Their fries are almost as good as the great McDonald's fries with lard.  I miss fries fried in animal fat!  Bring it back America."}
{"text":"It was my first visit to Wienerschnitzel and OMG two words CORN DOG! It is better than the ones at the State Fair. I also had the polish dog. I am sorry but Costco's is better. The french fries were OK. The best thing I had was the corn dog."}
{"text":"If you like chili dogs come here. Something about their chili dogs makes me happy. The chili comes temperature hot and it's so delicious. You can also get chili cheese fries. They offer corn dogs and regular hot dogs as well. This is a prime location in Tempe. It's located near the college and Tempe market place. The restaurant is always clean and the staff is nice. They make sure the tables are cleaned up and trash is thrown away. They always have deals going on so that is a bonus too."}
{"text":"Regardless of location you should strive for excellence that would include not having off duty employees coming I to your business and interacting with crew members in an inapropate manner my order wasn't complicated a no 1 combo and a number 4 combo 1 chili dog 2 chili fries and a 6 pack mini corn dogs but I waited for about 25 minutes last time I worked for wienersnitzle employees got a meal on discount while they worked not off the clock for themselves and friends with desserts"}
{"text":"Guess what $10 for a tray off food. Just what I would expect. I ate the Chicago dog, a chili cheese dog, a couple of corn dogs and big ice tea. Did the trick nothing fancy but they never promised fancy so they are Ok in my book."}
{"text":"You know, I don't know why this place gets a bad rap. It's not some fancy gourmet roach coach or hoity-toity restaurant. This is Der Wienerschnitzel. You come here for chili cheese dogs with possibly onions, french fries, mustard, bacon or some other junk you can throw on a dog. You know exactly what I'm talking about, you get this anchoring for their sloppy, gooey chili cheese dog there's just no going back. It hits the spot every time! And are you really going to argue about the price? It's 5 for 5. You can't get bomb chili cheese dogs anywhere else for that price! I've eaten at this location since they've open the doors and I'm never had a bad meal. I've also never had poor customer service. Heck, last time I was in it was for the 19th Star Wars movie release and I got myself a Wiener saber...... Yeah, I'm pretty stoked that that got past all the scrutiny of today's society. I've got 2 of them tucked away in their original Wienerschnitzel plastic wrapping so just in case it becomes so taboo I might be able to make a couple extra dollars on eBay in 20 years. Come to Wienerschnitzel for the awesome chili cheese dogs or else just go somewhere else if chili cheese dogs isn't your thing"}
{"text":"Jhon gave us great customer service he saw us cleaning the table and immediately stopped us and he cleaned it for us def the best wienerschitzel I have been at it makes me want to come back here and eat someone promote him...he looks like he could be an awsome manager one day"}
{"text":"I ordered a combo off of Grubhub from here and the delivery guy forgot my drink. He didn't take responsibility for his mistake and told me to go ahead and call the restaurant, so I did. I spoke with a manager -I didn't catch his name, but he was super nice and offered to bring my drink to me himself! I don't work far from this location, but I definitely appreciated the excellent customer service. 5 stars for the manager and his hospitality."}
{"text":"Was pretty sure I didn't want to eat there. But my daughter insisted. Neither of us had eaten there before so we gave it a try.  I ordered a Chicago dog with fries. My daughter had two corn dogs. We sat in this smelly lobby and chat as we watched the folks walk down the sidewalk. I was impressed by the hot dog and the fries until I found a hair in the package holding the fries. Now, I was going to overlook the aged decor and funky smell until that happened. The guy behind the counter was in his first day and he was very accommodating but hair in my food is a deal breaker. Will go to ted's next time..."}
{"text":"I love Der Wienerschnitzel, I recently moved near this one and am happy to visit a couple times a week. Food is excellently prepared and the service always friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"I was wondering what could be so great about a hot dog that there is an entire take-out place dedicated to it....  On a sober and empty belly, I gave it a whirl.  And let me tell you damn they have good hot dogs. The perfect amount of snap when you bite into it , nice and thick -not flimsy and floppy like a Sonic hot dog, or puny like a Target hot dog, or made out of turkey like the new disgusting IKEA hot dogs....  I tried a chili dog but I preferred my plain one better.  I don't even care what part of the cow is made out of, the next time I have a craving for a hot dog I'm coming here!  Cons, too much ice in the soda"}
{"text":"Like this location, fairly close to my house and open late. Whenever I'm in the mood for some fresh dogs, I jet over here. Highly  recommend their  ALL BEEF mustard and chili dogs. Check out the fries too, super salty, always fresh and leave you wanting more! Not a big fan of their pretzel or corn dogs- expect a little bit of wait, perfect hot dogs don't take minutes to make!"}
{"text":"I love Weinerschnitzel, but this location is FAIL.  I went in with a coupon for lunch as I was working down by ASU that day. I placed my order to find out that it would have just been cheaper if I had ordered the combo instead, but then discovered that on top of it all the clerk rang me up wrong. This isn't usually a big deal, so I just asked that they correct my order to the pretzel bun chili dogs that I enjoy so very very much.  Short version of the story was that the manager was rude and I had to swipe my card again for another 60-something cents for the pretzel bun upgrades. A good manager would have just done it for having screwed up my order but he copped an attitude with me as well.   Maybe he mistook me for an ASU student trying to cause him trouble and not, you know, a paying customer. Who knows.  Just make sure you speak slowly and make them read your order back to you (TWICE) and you should be fine."}
{"text":"This place used to be really good and I would eat there once a week.  Then I noticed the usual manager was gone.  The place really went downhill fast.  The quality of the food is not even close to what it was.  Cold fries, bad onions and the buns taste like they are no longer steamed but microwaved or they are just stale.  It is hard to tell.  If you are the owner of this particular franchise and are reading this PLEASE get the old manager back!  You must have noticed a decrease in sales $."}
{"text":"Disgusting. The food was unacceptable, and the staff was even worse. They got our order wrong, they were crazy rude. We will never be back."}
{"text":"Worst fast food place I've ever been to in my life!  Other than finding a hair in my chili, the center of my hot dog was still frozen. I get that fast food is typically frozen but atleast cook my food properly!! Do not come here!! Everything is dirty about this place. If you like frozen hot dogs and eating in a dirty environment than this place is for you!!"}
{"text":"My first job when I was 16 was at a wienerschnitzel in CA.   This is bottom barrel crap food, but sometimes that's what you want.    This place doesn't disappoint as long as you stick to the basics, chili dogs, corn dogs, chili fries.  I have never been sick after eating here.   The service is rather slow, and it does get busy at times."}
{"text":"Its good, inexpensive fast food.  I ordered two chili dogs and fries.  The food was piping hot, light tasting and fresh."}
{"text":"THE BEST!  This location is by far the best of all the great sanctuaries of the soul we know as \"Weinerschnitzel.\"  I've never had a bad visit here, never. And as my waistline can attest there are frequent visits.  The food is always fresh. Frequently I unwrap chili-cheese dogs and have to hold them by the AC vent because it's so hot and fresh.  The drive through service is always awesome. Never a problem, fast and very courteous. GREAT JOB GUYS!  Some people complain about a few of the specialty items. To me this is a non issue because I come here for the dogs, and they are delish! Corn dogs, chili dogs and just plain old dogs... this is my favorite place for them all. And the prices are good too.   I'm off to Der Weinerschitzel (their old name by the way)! Can't wait for the chili to be dripping down my face..... pearly gates and harps...."}
{"text":"Wienerschnitzel is no Tommy's. The chili is not as good and the beef in the burgers tastes cheap and reheated. But in a pinch, it works. The price is fair and they have a few good options I've not seen any where else. Like the junk yard dog and burger. Those are topped with fries and chili. Good eats given it is coming from Wienerschnitzel. I even saw some fish options on the menu tonight. That was a surprise. Not that I would order any of it. I don't care for fish.  Basically, since I don't live near a Tommy's, this is where I go for a chili dog and don't want to make it myself."}
{"text":"Always good food, but to get everything that everyone wants you gotta get the 25 buck meal.  We do like their kraut dogs."}
{"text":"I remember Der Wienerschnitzel from literally decades ago. I enjoyed the hot dogs back then. Maybe because I was much younger.   What a sad excuse for a hot dog I had today.   I paid $2.59 for the so-called Chicago-style hot dog. It was loaded with relish (should be pickles) and minced onions (Should be fresh onions). There were two UFO peppers off to the side.  I bit into one of them and couldn't even break the skin, instead it squirted all over the table. Two wafer thin tomato slices (should be wedges) and a minuscule wiener.  I mean, I had to look to make sure the dog was even there. The relish overpowered everything else.   Terrible.  Topping it off, they only serve Pepsi products."}
{"text":"It has been over a year since I went into this location. Time makes you forget why you stopped going into. I drove up to the drive thru at about 3:45pm today April 1st, 2017. No April Fools here, just plain lousy service again. I ordered two corn dogs medium get and a medium strawberry lemonade. I then ordered two need Angus dogs with catsup, mustard and relish. Medium fry. The guy reads back the order kind of nose in the air, so I drive up to the window pay. And wait for order, everything but no fries and they acted like we never ordered it. We were not charged, but it is frustrating when you look for something and it is not in your order. Two stars is the best I can do, the food we got was good and hot."}
{"text":"Really gotten pricey for a sub standard hot dog.then when they charged me .25 per pickle I figured it out there in trouble financially?  Ice tea like water and fries had no taste?"}
{"text":"Great place to come when you dont have much money, the food is always as ordered and the staff are always professional and friendly.  Ask for Amazing J!"}
{"text":"This is for the Tastee Freez  part of the fast food restaurant. We had lunch with my FIL and his wife (hubby's step-mom), so we had dessert here. We all had something different- one vanilla cone, one chocolate dipped cone, a root beer float and a copycat blizzard. The price for a regular cone is 99 cents, while the root beer float is $1.99. Not bad. I had the root beer float and it's pretty good size, but I didn't finish the root beer part.  This place is small but the cool air inside was refreshing on a humid day like today. The three people working here were nice. We were the only ones here until another customer showed up. Maybe because it was late afternoon.  It was clean inside. The seats were along the wall."}
{"text":"Customer service here is phenomenal! Food is always excellent unless I overstuff myself :)"}
{"text":"I ordered three hot dogs and received only one that was correct. The guy in the drive up was a nice guy, but my order was wrong. I didn't notice until I got the home, called but no one answered. I was charged for my two chili cheese dogs # 1 but got two mustard dogs.  Will never leave the drive though without checking your order. Or go somewhere else    Manager reached out and offered to make my order right. Very nice. Collecting on his offer as I type this. Will be back to eat again. Very happy he took the time and effort to fix this."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of Wienerschnitzel, but it is very convenient when your craving some sweets on a late night snack run. They're open until midnight every day and carry a wide variety of ice creams and treats. From sundays to root beer floats! This location is nice; the service is fast paced! Forget McDonald's and their broken ice-cream machine. Weinerschnitzel is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Totally disappointed. I wasn't paying attention when I pulled into the parking lot and I thought I was going to Whataburger. Imagine my surprise when all I saw was hotdogs on the menu! Took me a minute to figure out why, but once I did, since I was there, I thought I'd try something. Having never been to a Wienerschnitzel before I had to rely on the photos to show me what to expect. Saw the sauerkraut dog and had to order that, has mustard too, perfect way to eat a hot dog. Shakes were on sale, so i got a chocolate one. The shake was ok, it didn't make it back to the office, but not because it was 'awesome', it was because I was thirsty and that's all I had. Got to the office, opened the bag, pulled out the hotdog and, well, was quite disappointed. The photo shows a HOTDOG in a bun with a nice stripe of mustard and a heaping amount of sauerkraut. That is not what I got. I got a hotdog in a BUN, with about a teaspoon of sauerkraut that looked like it was dipped in mustard. Ok, so i'm used to the Costco hotdogs, where you can actually see the dog sticking out each side, so i was expecting as such. That's how the photo looked, but no, no dog sticking out. took me two bites each end to find the hot dog. and it was no bigger around than my finger and was tasteless. Won't go there again."}
{"text":"$.30 cents  ladies and gentlemen --- $.30 cents, that is the cost of good customer service. While treating my severely pregnant friend to a chili cheese dog today at Wienerschnitzel.. We experience what we like to refer to as the most odd, awkward and severely uncomfortable situation ever experienced at such a \"fine establishment.\" We place our order, Young nice girl... Slightly clueless though. I order what I feel is pretty damn simple, chili cheese Coney,all beef of course, and a small curly fry. My friend orders large curly fry and a chilli cheese dog.   We sit down and wait for  our food... 5 to 10 minutes later my tray arrives -all beef chili cheese dog and a small regular fry. The same nice, young , sweet and again sightly clueless girl smiles.. I remind her I ordered the curly fry and she quickly remembers that yes, I did order a curly fry and takes the tray back. In the meantime my friends food arrives, and it looks fucking delicious. Five minutes goes by and this young buck, with a pretty freaking sweet headset, comes over to our table.. He proceeds to tell me that \"small curly fries have an up charge of $.30 cents.\" We look at each other,  we look at him and say okay? Let's just give you an idea of how awkward the next 15 seconds went....Silence. He tells us again \"small curly fries are $.30 cents more than a regular fry... You ordered a  curly fry and she only charged you for a regular fry, so it's $.30 cents more.\" At this point we are baffled... My friend finally asked \"oh she's supposed to give you $.30 cents more for you guys messing up her order?\" He of course replies yes like that's normal.. Because again for probably the fifth time now he's reminded us that it's a $.30 cents up charge for a curly fry. Well, I let him know that I paid with a credit card and that I do not have any cash, he said that's okay we take credit card... No sir I do not want to put $.30 cents on my credit card because you messed up my order --I'll pass thank you very much. He smiles fixes his headset, thrust his hips left to right and is on his way back to his kingdom of wieners. At this point we could only laugh and think of how freaking pathetic it is that for $.30 cents they made themselves look like assholes.  Let's be honest, it's only $.30 cents...But I feel that that statement goes both ways.  Don't you worry folks, the story is not over, five minutes later he brings over the original small fry... That is now of course cold.  Good old Wienerschnitzel... Where you have to pay for their mistakes."}
{"text":"I'm a ED nurse and visit this wienerschnitzel often to buy food for some our staff. Never had a problem with placing an order until today at 1635. I ordered the $20 crowd pleaser substituting regular fries w/chili fries &asked for an additional large French frie. The girl working could not get my order right &kept repeating everything.The line by this time was long. I pay the$27 &ask her, where is my large frie? She says oh let me go get that for you,comes back charging me because she didn't charge me for it after I already paid.I tell her I'm not going 2charge my card again because you couldn't get the order right the first time even after repeating it several times and I started to pull off and she yells saying alright bitch!!! So I parked and went inside and she was very confrontational and continued to be vulgar with words calling me a bitch again & then lied saying I asked for a separated order of fries. I asked for a manager and he wouldn't even come out.The female in front was very apologetic and said that Jade was new etc.I told her not 2apologize for her and being new is no excuse to treat a paying customer in a hostile manner.This person has the worst if any customer service I have ever seen.I thanked the girl in the front for the way she handled the situation on her own.But I will never nor will our staff ever be going back 2that place as long as she is there.I do not want a free anything I just want u 2 know what kind of employee uhired."}
{"text":"My daughter and I really enjoyed our lunch today at Wienerschnitzel. The pink ice cream cones were cute. The staff was friendly and fun. The store was clean and inviting.  I would recommend this place for hot dogs, ice cream and good fast food service."}
{"text":"Ok, so its another fast food joint. I must tell you this place is very well run, the managers/owners take great care. The hot dogs are not bad, perfect if you need a switch from the world of burgers and chicken. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"Great food for the price. I love their chili dogs and their ice cream!"}
{"text":"this is the only stand-alone hot dog place in the neighborhood & it is usually really good.  this time it was late & everything was old & bad  even for $6 it was not a good deal  you would be better off going to 7-11 and taking your chances at any old gas station"}
{"text":"Have been here twice.  Never again.  The first time we went (over a year ago), there was a homeless man sleeping in the corner booth the entire time we were there.  Employees just ignored the fact.  We just returned from our 2nd visit at this location and won't be back.  While we were trying to eat our dinner, this random kid kept begging us and every other customer for money.  Once again, employees just ignored him.  Once he hit up every customer in the restaurant, he then stood outside at the drive thru and hit up the drive thru customers for money.  This sort of thing seems to just be the norm at this location...   *add on*.    ...And then, of course, I get the blanket response from Wienerschnitzel about my experience.  Really, check every response to any somewhat negative review on here!  It's the same, word for word.  No thanks.  I'll take my experience and LEAVE it.  I'm not up to corresponding with the some copy and paste response.  ...Hmmm, I wonder what this place will be after they fold up and close down.  I'll wait."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. I work in customer service, and I- I mean some people just don't realize how important the customer service business is. However Adrian who works the drive though (and every position as far as I'm concerned) understands excellent customer service. This dude is perfect. His patience, attention to orders, and timely service is the best thing about weinershintzel, or any food joint in the tempe area. I don't even like weinershintzel LIKE THAT, but this dude inspired to create a yelp account just to leave this message. Props"}
{"text":"It is a great place for classic American food.  The hot dog variety is exellent and the price is right.  I would recommend the Polish sandwich, it is awesome! The service was welcoming and makes you want to return."}
{"text":"Well, since I have been to Weinershnitzel last, the price has gone up. Also the street dogs I bought used to be wrapped in bacon and I thought they were deep fried.   They used to have crisp bacon spiraled around the dog, but not anymore. I can't say if the issue was location specific.  As far as the pricing goes, pricing everywhere in the vicinity has gone up.  Service at this location was top notch."}
{"text":"So far I've been here twice and each time I was given great service. The hot dogs are so good and I love the way they slide into my mouth and as I bite they pop and explode with flavor, lol. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times in the past 3 years. Each time I put it on my never eat lost after I leave, then think after months hopefully they improved and try it again.   Their sodas always flat, hair in the Hamburg chunk chili. I mean a chunk half the size of their Hamburger pattie was on my chili dog. It also came with a complimentary hair.  This location sucks."}
{"text":"This Weinerschnitzel has given me good service every time I have visited. It's in a busy shopping plaza and has many different businesses nearby. The neighborhood is a little bit of a rough area, but it's not too bad. As far as the restaurant goes, it's relatively small, and looks to as if it is geared towards takeout, they don't necessarily want a lot of customers in the dining area. Food quality is good and service is a little above average for fast food. They are always running specials, many times for 5 corndogs or chilli dogs for about $5.00. They're a good place to go, give them a try."}
{"text":"Good, hot, fast and friendly. Very clean.  However the music is TOO loud and not appropriate for all. When I say loud; can't hear the person across the table LOUD."}
{"text":"There was only one vehicle in front of me but a guy still came out to my car to take my payment to speed things along. I thought that was cool and an extra touch of awesome customer service.   The food is pretty good too. I always have to have chili cheese fries when I come here.  Today I tried the Junkyard Dog. It was topped with grilled onions. Fries, mustard and chili. Messy but good."}
{"text":"Never been to a WienerSchnitzel before so i was excited to have the experience...its such an awesome business name. I like polish sausages and they had one but ouch it was not very tasty. The service was good and they had awesome deals for famlies---like 5 dogs and 5 fries for super cheap---but in my opinion, baseball games, street vendors and any backyard grill have much better polish sausages."}
{"text":"Perfect spot to go if you are short on time and money. Their chilli cheese dogs are a bit messy, but always cooked great! I've also had their corn dogs and again, was not disappointed. I am not a fan of their french fries. But other than that, it's a cheap fast meal that I enjoy. The workers in the drive thru are always very friendly as well."}
{"text":"I have a friend who is from Austria, and she hates the fact that this place is named just like an Austrian dish that DOES NOT consist of hot dogs or anything like that. That aside...  I like this place. They have good deals, though the trade-off for that is you're not getting the best food ever. If you walk in here with expectations of high-quality food, this is not it. Think Del Taco and you're on the right track.   I don't really have a lot to say about this place other than it's value-oriented. And there's a Subway connected to it if you feel like eating that."}
{"text":"Ok, Im 5 starring this solely for the chili dogs.  I seriously could eat a dozen of these and not think twice. Ive been here about five times and usually get the chili dogs.  Of course when Im eating them Im always wondering if my stomach will kick my ass later on.  Thankfully it enjoys them as much as I do.  They have some new Chicago dogs, which are probably good, but been too busy with their Chili dogs.   Heads up.. No these aren't gourmet chili dogs that you get at some fancy place, they are small sloppy, messy, fast chili dogs.. I love them"}
{"text":"Cheap hot dogs with various options and incarnations (e.g., Chicago dog, pastrami dog, corn dogs).  You can even get 5 chili dogs for $5, how ridiculously cheap is that?  Everything tastes pretty greasy, as is par for the course with other fast food places.  I tried the Angus pastrami dog, which came on a pretzel bun with mustard and pickle.  There was a decent amount of pastrami on the hot dog, and the hot dog itself had a nice \"bite\" to it and was juicy.  The pretzel dog looked a little smashed, but tasted OK.  If I'm feeling like a real cheap skate this might be a good option if I want a hot dog, but with Ted's hot dogs close in this vicinity, I'd rather go to Ted's if I want quality vs. quantity/price."}
{"text":"Blech. How can you mess up a turkey dog? I could've nuked mine at home and it would've tasted better than this. I won't be back. Also, I ordered a meal in the drive through and they forgot the fries."}
{"text":"When I travel to the southwest (AZ, NV, CA)...I make it a point to go to a Schnitzel because the closest one to where I live is in Texas I believe....you can get 2 chili dogs and fries to go (if you already have a cold drink) for less than $5...service was efficient and nice on a late Sunday morning.,..good sustenance for before going to a football game at which one dog (without fries and a drink) is $4."}
{"text":"I love to please the food is also just want to have a Chicago hotdog on the menu But it's not on the menu which is kind of disappointing overall the food was great And I wish they stayed open online it said they were open until 1am and I was hoping to get a midnight snack but they were close enough the only problem I had customer service was good all the employees was very caring and I hope to eat there again"}
{"text":"I used to live in Chandler and would go to this place often. I now live further out in San Tan Valley but we still come here. My wife is from California and she would always tell me about this place years ago then we started going regularly. The service is always way above par. They are always super nice and clean too. The place is well maintained which isn't normal for most other fast food restaurants these days. The place has a cozy and classy feel to it too. I love how they have two TVs in the lobby to watch while you eat. Even though I live over 45 miles away we still come here to eat when we are in town. I ate here last night and it still has awesome service and everything is nice and clean still too. I used the bathroom and was surprised how clean it was and you can tell someone just got done doing some cleaning in there as well so it seems like they clean it all day which is awesome too. Of all the places we go to in town this one has to be the cleanest but also provides the best customer service.   Another cool thing is when you order your food and sit down to eat. Instead of calling a number or calling you to get your food they actually bring it to your table so you don't have to get up and get your food. This is another plus for me. I've ate many, many times at this location and I've never had a problem. They've never made a mistake on my orders either, which is another rare thing for fast food restaurants in today's world lol   One thing I also like is how the cashier will also listen to what you are ordering and will help you save money by giving you the bundle meals instead of charging you individually for each item. For example, I ordered three chili dogs and two corn dogs, the cashier actually gave me the meal that comes with 5 items to pick. She even told me while she was doing this as well. Very nice and I appreciated it very much.   Overall, I can tell that this place is managed with presentation and quality customer service as a priority. I have no complaints at all. The food is good, the service is great, and the place is always clean. Never a disappointment at this location ever."}
{"text":"I come here to satisfy my cravings of corn dogs. It's wienerschnitzel.. It's nothing spectacular BUT this location deserves 5 stars for spectacular service! 6/10/16 12pm the ladies working the drive through deserve recognition ! Thank you ladies"}
{"text":"I am not sure why this is a five star review. I mean it's fine. It's definitely not the best quality even for fast food terms. It's also not that consistent. Although I do like the chili cheese dog that and their French fries are the only things I get. Not worth one star, but definitely not 5."}
{"text":"I pulled into the drive thru last night (4/1/16) at about 1153pm. As soon as I get to the speaker to order - I have a voice barking at me, \"We are closed !!!!\"   I pull up next to the window and I see someone sitting in their car waiting for food. On the window is a listing of their operating hours which are until 12am. When the window opens I shout over the car saying \"aren't you open till 12?\" And a younger African American female barks back at me \"We have no more hotdogs\" with a scowl.   This has not only affected my decision to return to this location but to go to any location ever again. Plus I will make sure to tell everyone I know how terrible my experience was, working at one of the largest hotels in Vegas, I'll have a good outlet.  Thanks for nothing :)"}
{"text":"Went to the location on Rock Springs, I was craving a chili dog, hadn't been there for a while but used to like their chili dogs. \"Used to\", don't know what they changed, but I couldn't get through a whole one! Maybe it was the chili, but these are now crap! The fries were old tasting, the only reason I gave them 2 stars was the corn dog was decent. Sad when a lesser fast food joints quality goes down, surprised they're still in business! Guess I'll make my own from now on, at least they'll be edible!"}
{"text":"Our order was made quickly and efficiently, and correctly.  It's only a four star because they could use a little work in the customer service / friendliness department."}
{"text":"Loved the friendly service. They were very quick also. Order was right unlike a lot of other places. The price was affordable. Very close to work. I should come here more often"}
{"text":"Worst place ever! My mom, daughter, and I went here one day to get my daughter a chili cheese fry. We only live down the street so we didn't check the food before we left. To my horror my daughter comes in to tell me she found something in her food! I looked and it appeared to be a piece of a brillo pad that was mixed in with her chili cheese fries! I took it back and the manager just thought I just wanted it for free despite the fact that my 7 yr old daughter ate half of her chili cheese fry before discovering that there was a piece of a brillo pad, they refunded my money after snide remarks. My daughter is now 9 and thanks to their horrible service and lack of sanitary measures are the reason why my family and I don't eat at any Wienerschnitzel ever again and I advise all my family and friends not to eat here unless you want to eat cleaning products/supplies with your meal."}
{"text":"First time here. Great service at the drivethru. A girl came out to give me my soda while I was waiting because the person in front of me was taking awhile. I am not a huge hot dog fan, so I may not be back for the food. But I was impressed with her hard working positive attitude."}
{"text":"I frequent this restaurant and the service is outstanding the food is great and the restaurant is very clean and the manager doesn't outstanding job"}
{"text":"Yuck, yuck and one more yuck!  Friday night 7:30p, Craving a chili dog.  Go for the 5 for $5.95. 3 corn dogs, 2 chili dogs. (2 persons)  (1 star for friendly crew) * Fries, though hot are mushy inside. Like yucky mushy.  * Corn dogs dough is not fully cooked. Almost raw inside. Another yuck.  * Chili dogs, one is good. The other tastes 'wrong'. Third yuck.   1 yuck - maybe 2 yucks - suspicious 3 yucks - AX THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Ordered two old-fashioned hot fudge sundaes yesterday via the drive-thru. Was in a hurry so after she gave them to me I didn't look that closely at them. One was for my sick mother who is at a rehab facility nearby. She loves hot fudge sundaes.  When I finally took a spoonful about a minute later I was really disappointed. There was no hot fudge at all! Just some chocolate that had been squirted out from one of those Hershey's type bottles scattered throughout. They were tiny, and yet they cost $2.99 each! They were barely bigger than the sundaes McDonalds sells for a $1.00.  First and last time I ever eat at this place! Should have known better than to stop at a fast food place with a name like that! SMH"}
{"text":"Food is good but service is slow and my order had to be fixed.   I think the problem started with the drive thru speaker system which is older and hard to hear through.   But I we enjoyed the food and the price is hard to beat for a large family."}
{"text":"Always busy at lunch, Good Dogs with lots of variety. Love the Chili Cheese Fries!"}
{"text":"We've become regulars here by accident. We came here because we were short on cash but were hungry and this was in our price range. What makes us come back is the employee Kelly J. She is amazing and we've become one of her regular customers."}
{"text":"Seriously, if there was a Wienerschnitzel close to home, I probably would knock 2 stars from my rating.  Seriously, their chili dogs are barely adequate as daily fare but when I can only enjoy \"junk food\" when I'm on the mainland, the ratings go way up.  5 chili dogs for $6 is an insane bargain (by Hawaii standards, at least).  The hot dog is tasty but small - not like the gigantic ones available elsewhere in Vegas.  The chili tastes a little better than canned chili but definitely wouldn't win any cook-offs.  But man, are they good when you're hungry.  The service is quick but honestly rather indifferent.  Parking is abundant."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for an inexpensive chili dog, Wienerschnitzel is definitely the place to go.  This location seemed awfully slow at 10:30 am but maybe the lunch rush hadn't arrived yet.  I was the first of the day to get soda from the fountain and the diet Pepsi tasted HORRIBLE.  Even after letting it run for a bit, it still tasted horrible.  Probably more the Pepsi distributor's fault but if this isn't an isolated case, beware of how the soda tastes."}
{"text":"How on earth is a Wienerschnitzel worthy of five stars?  Easy.  The operator Said and his staff maintain the cleanest and most welcoming fast food outlet I've ever been to.  Probably because of that, the chili and hot dogs tasted better than at any other Wienerschnitzel I've ever been to.  Highly recommended when you have the munchies."}
{"text":"Maybe I was just hungry but wow, the chili cheese fries from here were better than any I'd had anywhere before.  The pastrami reuben suffered from the same problem as at other Wienerschnitzels, could use more pastrami, but it was a $6 sandwich, not a $15 one so can't really complain.  One big plus: while they don't participate in the app promotion, they take emailed coupons!  Will definitely do the short walk from Sam's Town again, the next time I'm staying there."}
{"text":"This is the nastiest place I ever ate at.Why would you put a slice of cheese on a chili dog?? Also the French fires are under cooked. Now I definitely know why I never had an interest for this place."}
{"text":"It was really mediocre and not concordantly cheap. We went on a nice Sunday afternoon and ordered a regular cheeseburger, a large fry, an iced tea, and the Tastee Freeze version of a Blizzard. The total was over $10 and none of the items were very good.  The burger was on par with a McDonald's burger, which is no compliment in my book. The fries were weak- I dont mean their quality was not strong, though that was certainly true, but rather they were thin, flimsy, and the embodiment of Wendel from the Simpsons. Maybe they are low on Vitamin D, or are due for a refil on their Procrit rx. The iced tea was okay, about as good as any place that doesn't have very good iced tea. I don't pretend that the prospect of a good iced tea is what got me in the door, but if that is what you are looking for, save your time.  The only ice cream we got was their blended soft-serve product that is the functional eqiuivalent to a DQ Blizzard. They have less choices for flavors and mix-ins, but it is basically the same product. I did not verify this, but I think it might have been a bit cheaper."}
{"text":"$1.00 chilli dogs....What's not to like about this deal!"}
{"text":"So I went here a while ago because I had some coupons for $1 chili cheeseburger and $1 chili cheese fries.  The normal prices for these are $1.59 and $2.19, respectively.  Anyways, my meal of 2 chili cheeseburgers and an order of chili cheese fries was only $3 bucks, which is the only reason this place is getting 2 stars instead of 1.  The chili is incredibly salty... and this is coming from someone who really loves salt.  I don't know how they haven't reduced their sodium yet, but they haven't.  It's not just a fluke with this location.  I've since been to another location in California and it was equally disgustingly salty.  So, definitely avoid, unless it's all you can afford with the change you have collected hanging out on the corner begging all day."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a fast food place so the quality is as you expect it to be. What I find cool about this particular place is that they have some friendly workers as well as a daily special for treats such as sundaes and root beer floats. We never had neither of these back at the Wienerschnitzels back in southern California."}
{"text":"How can you top the top dog? You can't... If you are craving haute dogs, go somewhere else... if you are craving WEINER dogs, YOU HAVE FOUND THEM!  I'm pleased with the food here, it is not too oily considering the cuisine. I think that the staff in the drive through are efficient and helpful, they do not try to rush you as you calculate how many HD's to get for your family.  One of the best things about this particular spot is that after the dozens and dozens of time's I've been here to eat via the drive through, they have YET to screw up our order... I cannot say that for any other \"fast\" or \"fast-casual\" establishment in this town."}
{"text":"I first went to this Wienerschnitzel back in 1999, and I still hit the location several times a year. I don't have to sell you on the merits of a Wienerschnitzel chili cheese dog, but not all locations are the same.  I have always found this particular Wienerschnitzel establishment to be clean and efficient, and there is ample seating. In fact, there is another location closer to my house, but I usually drive to this one because I've always had a positive experience here."}
{"text":"I think this place is growing on me again..i think wienerschnitzel is one of those places that if you havent eaten in a long time that once you eat it you want to eat like 2 more times and take a break again...Im not sure if that makes sense maybe im kinda weird.   This place is very clean and people are nice and when i even go thru the drive-thru they are always on point i havent got an order wrong once here. The food is always fresh and i know this because i drive here get my food and it takes about 10 min to get back to my house and the fries and food are still crispy and hot..Thanks guys i will be enjoying some more chilli cheese fries and corn dogs."}
{"text":"I love weiners! The pastrami is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"This place has the rudest most unfriendly staff ever! I just ordered from here and they pretty much just threw my food at me. And my food was cold and stale.  Next time I drive just a little farther for the more the better service."}
{"text":"Ordered an All Beef Chili Cheese Dog as well as 6 Mini Corn Dogs and Large Fries to share. The soda machine was out of ice and the iced tea was out too so we had to send our cups back to get filled up behind the counter. Everything tasted great and the fries were hot & fresh. The Triple Berry Sundae looked delicious but I was too full to order one. Good work, Wienerschnitzel. P.S. I would love a location in Goodyear or Avondale!"}
{"text":"Didn't catch his name just left drive through about 10 minutes ago the gentlemen had wonderful customer service that's hard to come by these days and our food was all nice and hot"}
{"text":"Worst Wienerschnitzel I have ever been to. I drove 15 minutes to get a large order of chilli cheese fries from this location and they are absolutely disgusting. The fries taste like rubber! Like I am chewing on rubber! I couldn't even eat them! Took 5 bites and had to throw them away!"}
{"text":"It's a Wienerschnitzel. If you've ever been on one of these, you pretty much know what you're getting yourself into.   Get the chili dogs. Add cheese if you like them that way.   Seriously, the chili is what makes these dogs special. Otherwise, they're *just* hot dogs.   They have Tastee Freeze soft-serve ice cream here if you're looking for a quick dessert, too."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I like hot dogs. I think you're either the kind of person who does or you're wrong. But seriously, set your expectations properly and don't bother coming here unless you want hot dogs. Better yet, get CHILI DOGS. With cheese and onions.   Some places have \"gourmet hotdogs\"... What are those? They're still using \"hot dog parts\" to make them, right?  I don't know how that works, but maybe it is the toppings that are \"gourmet.\" Wienerschnitzel is not one of those places. Baseline set, right?  OK, so if you're still with me, this is one of the bigger Wienerschnitzels that I have been in, and probably one of the cleanest as well. I think there were at most 3 people working in the place and no other customers when we showed up early one weekday evening. The girl at the counter was named Paloma (or, at least that's what I remember was on her name tag). She greeted us when we came in and patiently waited while my family decided what we each wanted -- uh, c'mon kids... HOT DOGS, like always. It's WIENERSCHNITZEL. Anyway, once we placed our order and paid, we got our drinks from the machine and sat down. A short while later, Paloma came out with a tray of food containing our order. Everything was hot (fresh fries!) and as we ordered it. I probably ate one more hot dog than I needed, but it was good.   I didn't visit the restroom, so I can't comment on its state, but I can't really ask for anything else from a fast-food hot dog joint."}
{"text":"Update on my Wienerschnitzel review of 2015.....Not much has changed, except maybe the price.  I've spoken with the owner/manager (not sure which) and told him that a hot dog bun should be steamed or grilled or something....not taken from the packaging. He assured me he would speak to his employees.  Well, had a quick lunch at this location....it was extremely busy (drive thru window).  After about a 15 minute wait in line, I ordered and got my food to go.  Found a spot to stop and eat quickly....only to have a room temperature hot dog bun.  As much as I enjoy a kraut dog every once in a while....I need to find some other quick spot to grab lunch on the go."}
{"text":"Very good wish there was one in cave creek. It's so far ! But very good! They need poppy seeds on theor"}
{"text":"this place is the best one I've ever been to.  the food was fresh and delicious.  Adrian in drive thru was the best. great customer service. we were super impressed. my 5 year olds first experience eating a chili dog and she loves it  thank you."}
{"text":"I ordered at drive threw Chicago Hot Dog, and French fries no salt Bottom if the fries felt like Spit cold welted uncooked, very disappointed"}
{"text":"Good hot dogs if you absolutely have no other clue as to what you wanna eat for dinner. The hotdogs are tiny so you'll need to buy 3 to get full. The fries are ok, and they put mustard in every hotdog unless you tell them no.   My husband likes this place, I tolerate it. Wouldn't come here on my own. Lol"}
{"text":"Missed Wienerschnitzel! They don't have them in Spokane, Wa. The chill cheese dog & fries are awesome!"}
{"text":"Came around lunch time wasn't busy and was served quick, ordered chili cheese fries with onions and corn dog meal. Everything tasted delicious and satisfied my craving. No complaints."}
{"text":"Best chili cheese dogs around!!  Plus this place has nostalgia for me as my grandmother used to take me here for a mustard dog when I was little ;).  Having lived in the Midwest for the last 20 years I was excited to see a Wienerschnitzel when we moved back west to AZ, and was pleasantly surprised when they were still just as good as I remember (few other things are!!)"}
{"text":"I loved the hotdogs and fries. John and Ashleigh are so nice and have great customer service skills. Because of them I will be a repeat customer. Great job!"}
{"text":"I know it's fast food.  I know!  But when you've got to have a dog, you've got to have a dog. The deluxe dog or the Kraut dog are my faves.  They at least have veggies on them.   Everyone else got chili dogs and chili cheese fries.  Lots of decadence here!"}
{"text":"Need to work on customer service skills. I waited in an empty line for five minutes and the order taker acted like I was not even there. Not a \"I'll be right with you, one moment, or welcome to weinerschnitel\" nothing. I walked out. Can't tell ya how it tasted. Never got the chance."}
{"text":"Horrible drive thru! I waited 10 mins after i paid before they told me the fryer was not on and they were unable to service me."}
{"text":"My aunt was in town from Kansas and was thrilled to find out that we have a Wienerschnitzel!! Having grown up with it in So Ca it was like a trip down memory lane. The restaurant was clean and the service was friendly and fast. We enjoyed our chili cheese dogs that were yummy and inexpensive! I am sure we will be back the next time she is in town visiting!"}
{"text":"Came here because my boys both seen the big \"W\" and that's the letter of their first names. Plus they like hot dogs, so win, win for Dad. Awesome service and the manager even gave my boys free soft serve. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Everyone here is super nice and it's a very clean establishment.   The food is well, wisnerschnitzel!!  The chili is always super yummy. We always come to this one because it is very clean and always feel very welcome!!"}
{"text":"Wienerschnitzel  suggests that they use wieners. This is not the case. Wieners have a natural casing hot dogs do not. So the correct name should be Hotdogschnitzel. Now that we know the difference, the chili dogs are your average hotdog drowning in thin, but tasty chili. I like the French fries. they are not overly salty and they are not greasy either. I will return as soon as I get more coupons in the mail for a quick lunch on the go. They offer a good deal for a group. 10 chili dogs for $10.00. You can feed quit a few for cheap."}
{"text":"Oh, Wienerschnitzel, how I love thee!  There are seriously not enough locations! Get with it, Wienerschnitzel!  My Mom really wanted a polish sandwich (a polish hot dog halved and on rye bread with cheese and a pickel), and luckily I remembered the location on Serene, which isn't TOO far away from us.  They have lots of great specials - cheap chili dogs, corn dogs, family meal deals, etc.  And this location is also a Tastee Freeze, which is cool to know.  The drive thru staff was super friendly.  Also, the car in front of us seemed to be taking awhile to get their food, so the window attendant exited the store to come take our payment.  I thought this was really efficient, so when we got to the window, we could just get our food and go.  The food was delicious, and something different for a change.  I had a corn dog, which was cooked perfectly, and my Mom of course had her desired polish sandwich.  It's a bit out of the way, but when Mom is craving it again, I will be the stellar daughter I am and drive her to get her fix! :)"}
{"text":"This chain has slid downhill gradually over the years.  Tried a Chicago dog, it was an insult to all true Chicago dogs - crappy produce, marginal wiener, overpriced for what it was.  They charge 50c to \"upgrade\" to a pretzel bun.  Nice bun, hideously overpriced upgrade.  You're far better off at a local non-chain hot dog joint than any Wienerschnitzel location, in Brak's experience."}
{"text":"Good all beef hot dogs.  Like the Chicago, chile, kraut and other combo dogs.  Buns need improvement, but overall hot digitty dogs.  Service is quick and easy and 2 dogs make a gr8 meal. Heard that the corn dogs are tasty too."}
{"text":"Cheap, yes. Clean, no. Chili is the kind that looks the same coming out as going in. Only for the hardest of stomachs. Not the best neighborhood, but for Country Fair folks who live there, it's a quick grab-and-go. Everything on the menu tastes the same, so no preference."}
{"text":"First time to a Weinerschnitzel and it will probably be my last. The service was good and fast. Unfortunately, the food was less than mediocre. I got a corn dog and a chili dog. The corn dog was fine but the chili dog was awful. The chili tasted like old, canned chili. I don't eat drive through too often because I like to keep it pretty healthy. I don't have high expectations for drive either, but this was enough to keep me away for a long while."}
{"text":"We were on a trip on Easter and they were open, the guy who served us was so amazingly nice, even wished us a Happy Easter! We have eaten at many DW's in our lifetimes but this one by far was the best! The corn dogs were crispy not spongy, the chili dogs fresh hot and juicy, the chili so good, the fries hot and crisp not greasy soggy. The funniest part all three of us looked at each other and said this is the best DW I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Great honey corn dogs. chili cheese fries are a great hit to share. and taste freezees  and cones for a snack.  for a snack not a meal I would call dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"I like this place for their quick corn dogs. The one pet peeve is when they don't give me ketchup. It might just me but I believe it should just be standard for every bag to get 1 or 2 ketchup packets. Is that weird?  Aside from my lack of ketchup I love their cotton candy dipped cones an jalepenos poppers with ranch perfection!  Ps whoever served at the drive thru was a cutie! That is all"}
{"text":"Won't come here again. Service lacked and kind of rude, the wait was FOREVER! My poppers were still cold in the middle. Blah, yuck!"}
{"text":"This location is horrible.. the management is very rude.. I ordered a chili cheese dog and i was very disappointed. I felt cheated. I received a penny sized amount of chili on my hot dog and no cheese when they even charged me extra for cheese!!! I showed it to the manager who seemed to be a lady of Mexican decent... she didn't even care. She basically said too bad and wouldn't refund my money... not even replace it with the correct item I ordered!!!! Horrible customer service! The only good thing about it was the restrooms were surprisingly pretty clean... maybe they make their employees complete a training course in cleaning restrooms instead of how to make a damn hot dog!! I will NEVER return to this location. Don't be cheating your customers!! I asked for a side a of jalapeños and they only gave me four AND charged me extra!!!"}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars!  This location is always consistently good in every way. My boyfriend and I go here when we want our chili dog and corn dog fix taken care of!  It is close to our house and not a place we eat at a whole lot so when we do it is always super good!  Staff is friendly, the store is clean and the food is fresh and tasty. I just wish I could make corn dogs at home the way they do!  Their wieners and buns are really good and the chili is a perfect topping along with the cheese!  This is our go to spot to enjoy a good wiener!  We order the 50\50 pack 5 chili dogs and 5 turkey corn dogs!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at this Weinerschnitzel today. I had planned to drive through, but with six cars ahead of me, I chose to go inside and order take away. This has been my go-to hot dog place since college. Their Chili Cheese Dog is, I must confess, an obsession. However, today's experience was dismal. Six cars in the drive through; seven people in line inside; height of lunch hour, and whoever the manager/owner is, they had chosen to schedule only two employees to handle everything. On Labor Day. Working as hard and fast as they could, it still took those two poor kids nearly 20 min to deliver my order. Perhaps management needs to revisit the issue of customer attrition -vs- money saved with a small staff ratios. I guarantee that there was a restaurant full of very unhappy customers today."}
{"text":"Same quality you'd expect from any other location - but can be really slow. I'm from California so I'm used to really slow but out here this is the only place I've had to wait in a drive-thru for 15+ minutes (one time they were legitimately busy, the other not so much at all). Still, the staff is really nice and pleasant to deal with and the food is good if you're into their style of chili. I've never been much into the dogs but the chili cheeseburger and chili cheese fries are still some of the best."}
{"text":"For some reason I have thought that these where what a burgers almost same logo etc. So I was kinda sad to  see this rather then one lol. But honestly it was really good even better then in and out I would say. That being said I will not rate over a 3 star those are generally what I like to reserve for higher end burger joints.Needing lunch just stoped in and got a burger with chili and cheese really good shockingly. Good prices etc.. but average drive threw food at best. I am still triing to find a place that does crushed ice."}
{"text":"I never come here, so not sure on the usual conditions of the store. But today... it was hot inside. Like to hot. I stopped by to grab some stuff for my co workers... alright damnit I got me a chili dog too! Anywho I asked dude at the counter whats up, AC out today? He replied yea, and every other day for the past few weeks! The hell you say? This is ongoing for weeks?? Man you have some dedicated employees because I would be gone. Best fix the AC before you have a serious employee issue. Hot ass Las Vegas and you want to skip on AC, not smart. Somone is going to get hurt, not a good look for the brand."}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I crave semi good cheap junk food.  They have specials through out the week I do enjoy their sundaes its similar to McDonald's chili cheese fries are not bad and the chili cheese burger is pretty decent.  So if you're craving your once in a while junk food lol check out.  Xoxo. Your fellow yelpie"}
{"text":"I tryyyyyyy to avoid rating fast food because it's basically all the same, but this one just begged for it. The customer service is probably the worst out there, very rude people. The place smells like a gym without and ventilation, not sure if it's the employees or just the place... or a combo of both? Their food presentation is horrible, and yes I do mean horrible for a fast food place, so I'm not setting high expectations. They can't even get the ice cream IN the cup for the rootbeer float. And when they see it's hanging out of the cup dripping down the side they chose handing it to you instead of wiping the cup off. Same with the hot dogs. Is is that hard to get the condiments on the hotdog? Apparently. They extra star is because once you deal with the bad service, singe your nose hair due to the smell, and put your food back together/clean up, the food is decent."}
{"text":"Sadly, I'm giving this place one star and an explanation why it is only getting one star.  The Manger/operator guy.  Sure, the food here isn't all that bad.  Probably a half a notch or so higher than most of the hot slop fast food you can get for lunch.  Most of the crew members are pretty attentive, don't seem to be meth addicted, and I see them cleaning the tables on a regular basis.  Looks like the crew changes over quite often, and I know why.  My beef is not with the crew members, oh no.  Not with the food or cleanliness of the store.  Nope.  The Manager guy, the guy who looks like a real pussy version of John Leguizamo.  This guy ruins about every trip I have to this joint.  That is my problem with this joint.  Elaboration will proceed now.  This guy is without a doubt one of the biggest assholes I have ever encountered in the fast food industry.  Actually, one of the biggest assholes period.  What a douche bag.  Seems like any time I have a coupon, this guy will literally butt in the middle of the order, give me a ration of shit and do about anything possible not to use it.  Seriously, what is it, 30 cents?  I had a store coupon that was on a tray liner a while ago and this nutsack got in the middle of the order, cancelled it and refused to let the coupon be used.  I asked why and he said it was not legit (why was it on the tray liner then fuckhead?) I checked the menu, they would have lost 10 cents.  Lady taking my order after P.J.L. (pussy John Leguizamo) walked away pretty embarassed said \"sorry\"  Not her fault.  Never saw her working there after then, was probably tired of that guys shit.  I don't blame you.  Last trip here, they have promos on their drink cups for free shit.  Awesome.  We all know this is the garbage that costs them nothing but I am a sucker for something free.  On my trip before the last, I got one for a free corndog.  SCORE!  I cash it in on my last trip, and the guy ringing up the order said it would be on a different ticket.  No sweat, I could give a shit less as long as I get my corndog.  Go to get my order, ask where the corndog is.  P.J.L. butts in the middle of the order, says \"This is your order, this is what you have\" and was a fucking prick about it.  Me, the customer.  Yanks the receipt out of my hand, gives me an attitude about it.  Who the fuck talks to a customer like that, even at a low rent fast food joint?  Fuck you.  Seriously.  The guy who took my order tried to explain the situation and dicknose literally looks at him, puts his hand in front of the guys face, and says \"ssssshhhhhh\" and snaps his fingers the same way I do to my dogs to keep them barking or eating drywall.  Who degrades their employees like that?  All he was trying to do was explain my free item was on another ticket.  Instead of listening, he made a complete asshat out of himself.  It was a corndog, what does that cost you anyway, about 12 cents in batter, a stick, and a combination of horse eyeballs and badger penis meat?    Dude (cashier guy, tattoo on your arm), tell that guy to get fucked and get a better job.  No one deserves that shit.  I am actually ashamed I didn't say something for you, I truly am.  What would have normally gotten a decent review is what it is.  My rant speaks for itself.  One shithead ruins it for the ones working for him.  For the ones working there, I will pray for you.  You need it.  P.J.L., get out of there and become a pimp in Tijuana, they need midget controlling assholes over there.  You would do great at that."}
{"text":"Solid 2.5 but I am rounding up only because I'm feeling generous.  Stopped in on a busy Friday night with my husband and son.  My husband ordered a Chicago Dog. My son ordered the kids 6 piece mini corn dog meal. I am not a fan of hot dogs so I ordered a small Tastee Freeze cone without the cone in a cup.  Took forever to order. The family in front of us were overcharged and the young Man at the register didn't know how to correct it.  Our order also was wrong.  Husband's dog came out immediately. Smelled and looked good. He ordered no tomato, but it had tomato.  My ice cream was ok. Nothing spectacular but I would order it again. Both my husband and I were done with our items before my son's order came out.  Average frozen fries and mini corn dog nuggets. Smoking hot. He pulled the coating off and ate just the small hot dog inside. I tasted the discarded batter and I thought it was good. A little on the sweet side.  Restaurant was really clean for the volume of people coming and going. Kids meal comes with a coupon for a small cone, or at least his did.  Meals were eaten and it was cheap. We will probably visit again, hopefully the counter help will be better trained, he looked stressed and overwhelmed causing him to make multiple mistakes making the experience not so stellar."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times. Service is good.  Food is ok.  Corn dogs are great.    The chili is thin and drops off the burgers.  I do like that they have a couple of \"family combos\". Ice cream is pretty good."}
{"text":"I went to Wienerschnitzel back in september cause i had a coupon for a chili dog, chil cheese burger and chili fries for about 3.99. It's now about four months later and i will never forget how bad the food was. The hamburger had grissel all threw it, the hot dog was gross and the chili was even worse. I would not feed this stuff to my dog."}
