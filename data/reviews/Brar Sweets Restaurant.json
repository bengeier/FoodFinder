{"text":"I would never go back to this restaurant. when its about brar one thinks of good food, good ambience, and variety. i have been to all three brar restaurants in the gta. this one in mississauga is way below average. the food was average, very little variety, pathetic lay out, disgusting ambience, and poor poor service. i will never go back to this brar location again. the best brar restaurant is  the one in brampton.."}
{"text":"went here last night and i definetely enjoyed the food... naan is very very good.. but have to agree the one in Brampton is much better an option compared to here... if you havent tried this restaurant before.. its a must go for you..."}
{"text":"Good variety of buffet items. If you are missing the food which is served in a North Indian wedding than you  can come to this place"}
{"text":"Don't ever eat here. The guy served us naan with wet hands straight from the kitchen. Food wasnt hot or fresh and the pickles tasted rancid. Service was very poor - we had to wait for 15 mins to get chaat because the staff didn't know where things were kept. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The food is tasty and the service is great (yes, sometimes you have  to wait to get a Thali for take out when they are slammed but that's life). The decor could use some sprucing up, but in general its the meal that matters and the food is superb! I would recommend this place for anyone who enjoys vegetarian Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Their food is tasty and it's all vegetarian (if that's your thing). The price is really good for buffet ($12.99, even on weekends). The service isn't the greatest when it comes to picking up your plates. But the food is good, and the price as well."}
{"text":"I went to Brar again in Nov 2014. The quality, variety and taste is excellent as it was the last time I visited in 2013. I have visited Brar many times before since 2003. I appreciate the standard maintained."}
{"text":"Brar Sweets is a very popular choice for vegetarian Indian food in Mississauga. I personally am not impressed. Although this place tend to be very busy, for some reason the food does not taste fresh at all. For instance the Malai Kofta, which tends to be a very popular dish, tasted like it was at least week old. And the palak paneer also seems to be made with canned spinach or something of that like. I do not like the Samosas either, which do not have the right melody of spicy, there is just something off. Oh and just skip the pakoras which have no substance at all, and the aloo tikis are not made properly either, they are way too dry. And also if you try the chana bhatura (chickpeas with fried bread), beware that the chana are not very good, they are over masala-d or something and they put a ton of greasy carrot pickle on top. The Indian sweets are decent, but I'm not a fan so there is no motivation for me to come here. Definitely skip this as a place to try if you are looking for a suburban Indian restaurant to try. People keep on insisting that the Brampton location is better, but I don't think I will ever go to Brar on my own free will."}
{"text":"Dont eat here, you will get sick. The food was horrible. If this is your first time dont waste your money. Go to MacDonalds instead. Everything in the buffet was old and had no tatse."}
{"text":"I'm glad that I wasn't put off by some of the worse reviews for this place! I went for a buffet lunch and was very impressed by the variety of delicious foods- I couldn't fit in everything, and that's surprising considering my gluttony for Indian food!   The service was attentive but seemed a bit distant, that's not something that ruins the experience though. The restaurant was very clean as well.  One thing worth noting is that the water doesn't have ice. I don't know why, but for some people this is a dealbreaker. Personally, I prefer it this way.  Overall, the best part of this restaurant is the fact that it's all vegetarian (no second thoughts for me about taking some of all I can eat!) there are some \"Western\" options for picky eaters or kids in your group, there are plenty of delicious sweets (not to mention those sold in front!) and the buffet price for a nice lunch is very reasonable.  I definitely recommend this restaurant for any fan of Indian food, vegetarian or not, and I can't wait to try their take-out as well!"}
{"text":"This place has one of the best Indian vegetarian buffet in Mississauga .. but I guess there is no consistency in their food .. at times it tastes totally fresh and at other times, you may just end up with a bad stomach .. They do have some take out options as well but guess they've started reducing the quantity these days .. I used to take out chola-bhatura some times but now the taste of their cholas is not as good and even the size of bhaturas have been reduced to a small circle. Same goes with their veg thali. It leaves a lot to be desired. Their chaats and sweets are still good though."}
{"text":"In short, if you are looking for low key, self-service, out of this world vegetarian Indian food, this is the place.  It seems like a sweets shop with buffet area. Decor was alright and was definitely better than I expected (given the low price). There were almost 20 veg options on menu with chaat, naan, samosa, pakoras, and sweets etc! Some of the good ones - saag, daal, paneer and kadhi. Naan was soft and warm! The service was more like self-service and ask what you need :) They provided custom made chaat in buffet!!  We came out stuffed and well contented :)"}
{"text":"This place has quite a variety. I have tired their:  Samosas - not the best but not the worst either Chaat Pappri - quite good and I think one of the best I have had in Ssauga. Sweets - are average, that I say as we have much better place in Ssauga."}
{"text":"Feel free to disregard this review if you aren't here for the samosas or the sweets.  I've been here at least a hundred times for both. The vegetarian samosas are only 40 cents and are always fresh! They come with two sauces, both of which are very good. It's my guilty pleasure, but I come here whenever I want to get filled and don't want to spend more then $2. When it comes to the Indian sweets, again, freshness is key. They are consistently fresh each time I buy, and they have a wide variety to choose from. The price isn't bad either.   I've yet to actually sit down and eat a full meal at this place, and I don't know why, given how much I've liked their samosas and sweets. Maybe I'll visit in the near future and update this review, but for now, it gets a full five stars."}
{"text":"Maybe I've been there on an off-day but my Dad's best friend is beyond obsessed with this place. Upon arriving to Toronto on one of our trips he had us meet him there for lunch. This Indian buffet-style restaurant serves a variety of meat and vegetarian dishes as well as breads and dessert. You'll find appetizer dishes and Indian street food as well as pizzas and french fries here. But the curries were watered down, the rice was crunchy, and I really wasn't feeling it. The chunteys didn't seem as vibrant and colorful as I'm used to (but when your Mom is a great cook, nothing will compare) and I wasn't completely pleased. I'd eat here again because I am sure I will have to the next time I am there but it did it's job in filling me up for lunch. I wasn't so pleased with what I had to choose from. They'd have to work on that instead of worrying about expanding into a huge brand for me to come back. In the mean time, they can count on my Dad's friend as a repeat customer, because he can't see an issue with it. Maybe we can chalk it up to a restaurant I'd have to go back to at another time to see what's what."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, for veterinarian indian restaurant, this is my choice.  their malai kofta, naan and other dishes are so fresh and so good.   Their desert dishes are also so good and pretty good selection. I am not a big fan of buffets but i love this buffet."}
{"text":"One word, \"cockroach\". If you can see cockroaches outside of the kitchen door you got a problem. The food is terrible and ruins the reputation of the other two locations. I love the Brar located on islington. Don't bother going to this one."}
{"text":"best samosas ever! that is all."}
{"text":"I dont know what other people get here but you should see how popular it is whenever you go in.   Their takeout pakoras are so awesome and delish! Get there early around 1pm in the afternoon if you want them hot and fresh....otherwise you should call before you go to ask for fresh ones!  The chat here is probably the best in Mississauga. My favorite is the Bhel Puri! I swear these guys do it the best when it comes to Chaat!"}
{"text":"Picked up some samosas and they had really bad after taste. They must have fried it in old oil. Front staff busy talking to each other. Took forever to get service. Overall very bad experience."}
