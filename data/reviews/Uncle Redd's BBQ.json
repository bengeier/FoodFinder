{"text":"Ordered the ribs, meat was tough, bbq sauce was bland."}
{"text":"Not sure if the proprietor was Uncle Redd but he was a nice guy. I needed BBQ I could eat behind the wheel and he proclaimed the Pulled Pork Sandwich. He not only is friendly but he was spot on with the sandwich.  A great and fresh potato roll with a well prepared pulled pork and topped with excellent slaw. The pork was just the right tenderness and the BBQ sauce tasty with a slight kick. This place needs your support.  Eat at Uncle Redd's!!"}
{"text":"Finally able to order something after trying for weeks, and the chicken was good. The baked beans were also flavorful."}
