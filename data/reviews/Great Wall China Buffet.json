{"text":"The food was terrible, the crab legs had no flavor like they were sitting in hot water all day. The sushi was never refilled while we were there. The worst Chinese Buffett I have ever been to and we will never return."}
{"text":"Great Wall is a perennial favorite stop for work lunch.  It is both inexpensive (8.33 with drink and tax for lunch) and the food is good.  I've been to Chinese buffets that have been terrible, but I've never been disappointed by Great Wall."}
{"text":"If you've been to a Chinese buffet, then you know what you're getting.  Extra points though for being meticulous about their food temperatures while I was there."}
{"text":"Omg I am a huge fan of this place!! I get takeout sushi and stuffed mushrooms all the time. Staff is great also. !!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a cheap chinese buffet that also doesn't taste like the food has been sitting out for days, go to Great Wall in North Olmsted. Quality of the food is excellent and the service is great. You will never have a dry beverage. They always fill up at the perfect time.

The food is excellent. This is definitely the best chinese buffet I have ever had and I have had a lot of chinese buffets all over Ohio. Lunch will only cost you $7. My buddy and I are frequent customers and plan to go much more."}
{"text":"Not only was this the WORST Chinese I have ever had in my life, it's one of the worst MEALS I've ever had. Even the fortune cookies were awful.

 - Sushi was rubbery and warm
 - Rangoons were cold and smelled fishy
 - Dumplings were greasy and chewy.
 - Inside of egg rolls tasted burnt and smelled terrible.

Despite this, I continued to punish myself with failed attempts of general tso and fried rice, which was syrupy, cold, filled with tendon, and all around disgusting.

The only possible saving grace from eating here is that if you were bound up, you could eat this greasy and cold mess of a buffet to be assured explosive diarrhea later in the evening. 

Staff was nice."}
{"text":"When my husband suggested going to this place I warned him that it was not going to be pleasant having been there for  a previous dinner. Most of the food was yucky.  The crab legs floated around in tepid water for an hour without being replenished when we questioned the waitress, she said that the cooks were busy.  The best dish was the coconut shrimp which I ate for dessert after having some during my meal.  The mussels were bland and the fish was blah.  Everything on the buffet had been sitting there for a ling time. Should have known to leave when there were only 5 other people seated when we arrived at 7:30 pm. Yikes!  Our waitress didn't bring new napkins nor did she pick up our used dishes. I'd recommend the sushi/buffet at Parma town or Yellowtail in the Akron area ."}
{"text":"Food is cool and not good. This is my first time and would probably be my last time to have meal in this restaurant. Will not recommend this Chinese buffet to anyone. I would like to go for a zero star if possible"}
{"text":"This is definitly good food.  The price is good.  My favorite is the coconut shrimp.  They have an extensive choice for kids too, like pizza and french fries, mini-hot dogs.  This is the only chinese restarurant I have been to in the cleveland area...but my comparison with others in los angeles, this place is pretty good.  I definitly recomend!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good place but it has steadily gone downhill. Arrived at 8pm today and asked when they were closing. They said 9:30pm. We like to put together an \"appetizer\" plate first and by the time we got up to get our food there was no lo mein, no egg rolls, no pot stickers, no chicken satey, and many other empty dishes were empty. NOT GOING BACK! Found some place else to eat, you will be disappointed here."}
{"text":"the place is filthy. the walls were gross - with slop all over the place. walking back to the restroom made me feel like i was in a Hostel movie. the bathroom wasn't as bad as i'd have expected but it wasn't cool to see bug spray readily available back there. makes you wonder.

so-so food. not everything was terrible but what was, was really bad. the egg roll was horrendous and so was the crab rangoon. on the other hand, the black pepper chicken was pretty good and the hot and spicy chicken was great."}
{"text":"Chinese buffets are rather hit and miss.  I've been to some awesome and horrible ones in my life.  Chinese people will go to Chinese buffets.  That's usually a good indicator of whether or not a Chinese buffet is good or not.  A friend and co-worker recommended this place to me.  She was also one of many who also recommended Nino's (see my Nino's review) so I was very wary.  I was pleasantly surprised with this place.  They had a great selection and the service rocked too.  Downside here is that pretty much everything is fried.  Even entrees that would never be fried at other Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"By far the worse buffet I have experienced. The food was dry, hard as a rock. When I took my son to use the restroom, the toilet was covered in urine with feces smeared on the wall.

I was thrown back when we went to leave and the bill was $56 for two adults & two children, one under 5. 

This is my first review...ever. I should've done my homework before heading out. I would not recommend this establishment to anyone."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of buffets, and there' nothing like a good Chinese Buffet, for both variety and value. 

The Great Wall, located In North Olmsted at Great Northern Mall is a great example of both. With a variety of foods, from General Tso's Chicken to great coconut shrimp and a variety of standards like egg and spring rolls, soups, stir-fry,  fresh vegetables and fruits and all sorts of interesting fare. The atmosphere is simple, slightly ornate and inviting and the service is really great. 

At under 10$ for lunch, The Great Wall offers a very tasty and healthy alternative to your usual fast foods and in a setting that comfortable enough for you to sit down and just relax and enjoy. I guarantee that this Great Wall is worth the visit (and your feet won't even get tired:)"}
{"text":"This is pretty good and nice selection, clean.  Go for lunch because the dinner is the same menu but at a higher price.  The best thing here is actually the napoleon mini dessert.  I could have a whole plate of them."}
{"text":"Not great Chinese food.  For the price, it wasn't bad at $11, but I have also had a lot better at that price. The fried scallops were over fried.  The sushi selection literally had no raw fish on it.  Everything else was ok, but not memorable."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited about 2 months back for dinner and it was awful! Food wasn't fresh and you are watched like a hawk the entire time. We frequent Chinese places so we were thinking it would be ok, however, we were very disappointed."}
{"text":"I used to like this place. I will not waste my money there again. Food was absolutely awful. Worst Chinese food I've ever seen. How can you screw up General Tso's Chicken or Fried Rice?  I'm usually pretty forgiving of the food at most Chinese buffets but these guys didn't even try."}
{"text":"I'm sad that's have to write this review.  This was my fav buffet, but not anymore. I took my family plus my brothers family for dinner. Total of 9 people $100 dinner. We went around 6:30, dinner time right? Everything should be fresh and hot?!? Nothing was fresh and it was no where near warm. I'm pretty sure the food was what was left over from lunch. It was horrible! We asked for some fresh food or at least for some of the stations to be filled and omg did all hell break loose. All 5 women began speaking in Chinese in an overly loud tone. This went on for about 10 minutes while they looked at us. I think they were mad lol. They did eventually get some new food out, but it took about an hour and we were starving. I think if I ever go back it will be during lunch time, never again during dinner. Oh and just a side note: fried shrimp isn't a dinner norm it's only on weekends. Maybe they should take the fried shrimp sticker off the buffet during the week :("}
{"text":"Pretty good food at a reasonable price. 
It's a buffet, so don't expect to be amazed, but still it's pretty good.
I think if you walk into a moderately priced buffet, you might know what to expect.
Everything does kind of have the same taste, like they cooked everything in the same wok. 
But again, it's a buffet.
And don't forget, \"coconut water for paying customer onry!\""}
{"text":"This buffet is so disgusting all the food was hard and old..and when we went to get dessert i picked up an item and dozens of bugs came flying out all the desserts. I told the owner and she didn't care..will NEVER return."}
{"text":"I have to imagine the monumental task of building the Great Wall of China was rivaled only by the logistical nightmare of feeding the people building it.  Enter Great Wall China Buffet.

GWCB features four main groups of food at six stations.  Could this possibly correspond with the four mythological creatures in the Chinese constellation?  Seiryuu (I know, these are the Japanese names), the Azure Dragon of the East--the core of Americanized-Chinese buffet cuisine, including wonton soup, vegetable lo mein, fried rice, General Tso's chicken, coconut shrimp, and BBQ roast pork.  Byakko, the White TIger of the West--cuisine from the New Continent, featuring Italian chicken, pigs in a blanket, crab legs, garlic bread, corn, and pizza.  Suzaku, the Vermillion Bird of the South--fried foods such as egg rolls, crab rangoon, chicken wings, chicken nuggets, and mozzarella sticks.  And, finally, Genbu, the Black Tortoise of the North--cold items and desserts like sushi, jello, ice cream, mussels, cocktail shrimp, and fruit.

For appetizer-like items, the Wonton Soup had the basic broth, perhaps slightly on the watery side.  The dumplings were kept in the soup (which I prefer), but are a bit smaller than most Chinese restaurants.  Scallions available to taste.  The Shrimp Chips are good when fresh (freshly taken out of a bag, that is), but usually they have been sitting too long out there and turn chewy and terrible.  Likewise, the Pigs in a Blanket are usually overcooked or a little stale from sitting out too long under the lights.  The meat is just cut-up hog dogs.  The Mozzarella Sticks changed from a previous visit, and the new version is a step backward--smaller and tough little sticks of breaded cheese.  The Crab Rangoons have a tough and chewy (instead of crispy) exterior.  There is just barely enough imitation crab in there to hold the name.  The Shumai are not particularly good.  I was surprised by how much corn and peas they put in the dumplings while their lo main and fried rice were so lacking in vegetables (see below).

As for main items, GWCB's Fried Rice was a disappointment.  Not too oily (which is a positive), but limited vegetable content.  Similarly, I lucked out and got a relatively fresh batch of Vegetable Lo Main.  The noodles were decent and not too oily like the lo main at many other places.  Unfortunately, as with the Fried Rice, there was a dearth of actual vegetables.  White Rice is hard to screw up--a big rice cooker sits near the back wall on the fourth station from the left looking from the front of the restaurant.  

The Italian Chicken was decent--cuts of chicken (maybe 3\" or 4\" long) in a dark sauce with peppers.  The Coconut Shrimp is my favorite dish--fried shrimp in a sweet coconut sauce.  Granted, you have to get past the slightly unappetizing look and gooey texture to enjoy.  The BBQ Roast Pork was a big minus.  Large pieces of pork, but short on tenderness and flavor.  Instead, you get tough pieces of quickly-cooked pork painted fluorescent red.  More points off for the General Tso's Chicken, which is supposed to be breaded and fried.  GWCB offered just pieces of cooked chicken covered in the spicy sauce.

In the event you somehow manage to save room for dessert, there is plenty to try:  The Fried Dough was simple and enjoyable, like a plain doughnut hole lightly coasted in sugar.  Butterfly Cookies are also good--an underrated and neglected dessert item; you'll find these in the back next to the Shrimp Chips.  The Puff Pastry looked promising, like a mini-eclair with a chocolate strip on top.  Sadly, it barely had any cream in it.

As for other notes, the dining room is large (though not as large as Double Dragon in Parma Hieghts) and relatively clean.  The plastic plateware is a little depressing.  Service is really spotty--my plate was always quickly taken away while I was getting more food, but drink refills took much longer and getting the check took significantly longer than that.  The dinner buffet with a soft drink is about $13 and change not including tip.  Finally, while I know one shouldn't expect particularly remarkable food at a Chinese buffet--and I wrote this longish review more for kicks than anything else--I think the two stars are accurate:  Among area Chinese buffets there are certainly better (Double Dragon) and worse (Oriental Palace) ones out there.  So...what's that ancient Chinese saying again?

{"text":"Yeah, we'd experienced' better a Buffet on many fronts...!  First of all, my friend's Service Dog was severely discriminatory against in unaccommodating him...!  Multiple times, we're we having Lance's presence discriminated against in various restaurants...!"}
{"text":"I give this place average 4 stars. Been here few times now and for the price the food is pretty good. However there isn't much Chinese goodness in Cleveland that I've heard about yet so maybe in comparison to the other places I've tried it rates a 4/5. Thanks, will probably come again."}
{"text":"Food cold and not bringing anymore out and they have the nerve to charge $13 for it. Will never go back very disappointing. Could of went to a lot of different places and have better food for this price."}
{"text":"My dad and brother love this place, so it is somewhere that my family has visited many times. I'm not a huge fan of buffets, but this one seems clean and the food is always good and I always see people restocking. 

They offer your general Chinese and American food. They have everything from fried rice to crab Rangoon to general tsos, as well as pizza and onion rings. They also offer sushi, a wide selection of fruits and puddings, and dessert. Everything I've had here has been fairly tasty, although nothing to write home about. I stick to what I know and am always satisfied. 

The staff seems friendly and they are especially nice to my dad as he is a frequent customer. The prices seem fair for a buffet as my family of 4 visits for about $40 Total including soft drinks. We will continue to visit as our go to Chinese buffet!"}
{"text":"Do not go here this place deserves all of its bad reputation i went there at 7:30 and they close at 9 and they didnt bring out anymore food and the food that was there was cold and could tell has probably been sitting there for hours and then half the stuff i wanted wasnt there and then they have the nerve to charge me $13? Wow dont go here absolutely horrible"}
{"text":"Literally biggest waste of 12$ in my life. We were the only two in there, and the best thing I had was the water and fortune cookie."}
{"text":"Ended up not eating there. Called on the phone and was told the restaurant closed at 10. We walked in at 9:10 and were told they couldn't seat us as they were closing. When I told the waiter about the time marked on Yelp, Facebook and Google; he replied, obviously irritated, that the info was wrong."}
{"text":"If I can put no stars I would. This place was terrible. Food was cold and soggy. Terrible. Don't go here. Warning."}
{"text":"We found a dead baby roach in our mandarin oranges. NEVER again!!!  I don't even think I can even look at Chinese food after that. They did give us 10% off after we showed them the offender. Thanks.....?"}
{"text":"Ok dont know what most people are talking about but this place is actually decent. Food tastes pretty good and hot. I did go there at 12-1pm so thats where its mostly fresh from what i heard on here. The only bad thing about this place is the variety of food is small. But other than that food tastes good."}
{"text":"Great Wall has been around for years, located near Best Buy at Great Northern Mall in North Olmsted, Ohio. 

I'm writing this review based solely off of my last visit, as I have been there numerous times. 

GOOD: Huge selection of food, including many attempts at \"American\" and Italian dishes, which is good if you are bringing kids who might not like Chinese food. The number of choices is staggering, and overall the food is pretty decent. Some of the dishes are better than others, though, like pretty much all of their classic chicken dishes, pepper steak, and spicy shrimp. Their Lo Mein is on point, especially for a buffet. They also have ice cream. They also seemed to change out the food quite often - always a plus!!

BAD: Cost. It's almost ridiculous how much I paid for myself and 3 children to eat there: well over $50!! It was dinner, which is always more money, but most Chinese buffets include crab legs at the higher price. Not Great Wall. NO CRAB FOR YOU!! Refills on drinks are SLOW. 

AWFUL: The ridiculous table of \"goods\" for sale when you walk in is tacky, crass, and ABSURD. It's like an eBay graveyard. The inhabitants of the Island of Misfit Toys said they wouldn't go anywhere near this thing. 

In the name of General Tso, this table must go!!

DEPARTURE from current visit only review: The people working there (over the years) just aren't friendly. They seem to despise the fact that they work at a Chinese buffet, which since I believe it's a family-owned business may very well be the case. I wouldn't want to work with my family, either...

FINAL: Despite the rummage sale table at the front, the slow refills, etc. I truly think that Great Wall deserves my 3 stars. Why? Because the food is really pretty good, buffet or no buffet. There are a lot of Chinese takeouts that WISH they could match some of Great Wall's buffet items. Some of them are that good - I'm looking at you Spicy Shrimp... 

I will continue to eat there the typical 1-2 times a year that I do."}
