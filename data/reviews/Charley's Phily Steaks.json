{"text":"I've never had a Philly Cheese Steak before and figured I'd give it a shot. This is one of the better food vendors at the Mall at Robinson. I ordered a small phily steak sandwich and got the combo meal, with a drink and cheese fries. Was a surprised when the total came out to 10.04!  You can see the cooks prepare the food, and the sandwich was very fresh and piping hot fresh."}
{"text":"I was a visitor at this mall last week for a number of days and had to eat at the food court 3 days in a row.  This seemed to be the popular choice as the line was so long the first few days I moved on to Chik fil a.  On my third day I was able to weasel my way into the line.  Ordered a jalape√±o steak sub and fries.  I must say I was very impressed with the customer service, options and quality of the sandwich.  I don't expect much out of a food court.  But this was way better than the average dining option.  A bit pricey but nothing out of the norm for the quality.  I would actually even entertain the idea of stopping at the mall just to eat their again.  Some very pleasant employees there as well.  Always nice to see people who take pride in what they do and what they serve."}
{"text":"I was excited to try these cheesesteaks so I stopped by for lunch and got a large to go, I figured for $11 and change for the sandwich it had to be good. I'm sorry to say it wasn't, very bland taste and smaller than I would think for the price. I'm glad I got it to go and ate it in my vehicle to hide my tears."}
