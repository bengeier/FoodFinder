{"text":"Beautiful setup, terrible service! And by terrible, believe me I mean it. We were encouraged to leave by two members of staff even before we have a chance to try their food only because we were there by 9:57am and they were supposed to open at 10am! I'm now happy that we didn't waste a dime anyway. When a business feels comfortable with a line up at their door, it takes a prudent management to invest even more in service and unfortunately that was not the case for them. It doesn't take that long for Cafe Belong to be long gone!"}
{"text":"I came here last night with six colleagues at around 8 p.m.  We were pretty much the only party left in the restaurant and we were there for four hours.  We got the chef's tasting menu (5 courses), and we ordered 3 to 4 bottles of wine.  I wasn't picking up the tab on this one, but I fully recognize that it is not a cheap place to dine.  The chef's tasting menu was $90/person, with the chef customizing a menu for your table.  Here is what we were served and my commentary on each:  Leek soup with crisps with micro basil: Average - nothing special, but at the very least it wasn't overly salty.  This is a cream based soup and was neither overly creamy nor watery, which I preferred and found quite pleasant. Apricot gelee and beet field green salad: while the apricot gelee was a nice touch and unique, this was your average / typical salad - nothing too special to comment on. Two tacos - perch and pork: Both tacos were flavourful, but the table's favourite by far was the perch taco.  The perch was deep fried, but it was very fresh and you could taste it. With a kick of lime, it was a favourite of the evening. Balsamic (I think?) chicken wings: Next to the perch tacos, the chicken wings were also a table favourite. They tasted like a blend of your traditional honey garlic with a balsamic twang.  The wings were just crispy enough and not saucy at all but full of flavour. Yum! Risotto and roast chicken with truffle oil and mushrooms: The risotto was disappointing as I found it a bit undercooked, and the chicken could have been a bit more moist, all things considered.  I found the mushrooms cooked in a little too salty as well.  Dessert: chocolate chip cookies, brownies, chocolate cake, apple tarte, cheesecake with raspberry compote - oddly enough, while none were terrible, the table favourite was the chocolate chip cookie. Not many of us touched the brownies (very plain and not worth your while).  Ambiance is cute and intimate, but the location is very out of the way.  There is nothing else around the Evergreen Brickworks, so it is quite the trek / expedition to just come here to dine.  However, for a quiet and quaint dinner, this is the place to be.  Wine - I was too tired to note the wines we tried, but the white was way sweeter than anticipated, and the red was just right.  Not tremendously helpful, but for local wines, I was satisfied."}
{"text":"Quite an impressive spot. My boyfriend and I came by for brunch and we were both quite satisfied by everything we ordered. We had the smoked trout plate, eggs be with sautéed kale, and a side of beans. It's even better that their menu is seasonal. Needless to say, we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Eggs B was so good!! A little warm in the summer though, AC is not enough for the high ceiling, all the heat from the kitchen is trapped inside.. Oh well but still yummy!!!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that this is my very first time writing a review about anything and I am solely writing this because of my nasty experience yesterday.  When we arrived at the café first thing in the morning we got this negative attitude from the hostess. So we decided to address that to our waiter. You are not going to believe that his response was that: \"well she is just doing her job so you can either stay or you can leave\". Since we were shocked from his behavior and didn't reply back he asked: \"ok so do you want distilled water, sparkling or do you just want to LEAVE\"?  Obviously we left the place and made a complaint about the staff to the manager.  I have been living in Toronto for over 10 years and NEVER had an experience like that before. What a shame! I was extremely disappointed and will not give this place my business ever again. The staff clearly needs more training to show the same respect that customers show them."}
{"text":"Cafe Belong is probably one of my fav brunch spots! Especially on days where I am able to catch the farmers market at Evergreen Brickworks.   The restaurant feels homey, down to earth, comfortable. Although you might be sweating a little if it's a very hot summer's day (no air conditioning).  Servers are super friendly and helpful.   The food is quite amazing in my opinion. The balance of sweet and savory was perfect! I had pulled pork on a bed of pancakes. The presentation is killer and my tastebuds were super happy with my food choice.   The cost for a weekend brunch is probably slightly on the higher side but with really good ingredients and interesting location, it's worth the splurge once in awhile!"}
{"text":"i sincerely hope others had a better experience. Forty   minutes wait for our table. Plain food without much inspiration and cursory service. Not good value at all."}
{"text":"mmmm, those Egg Biscuits with Greens are my favourite! We stop by Cafe Belong every time we shop at the Brickworks market for this delicious morsel, along with a coffee. I wouldn't say the Americano is the best I've ever had, but it's certainly a worthy cup to start the day with. Friendly service. In the busy times it can be a bit slow, just be patient and appreciate that it takes time for quality. The communal table is a nice spot to sit and strike up a conversation with a stranger. We're looking forward to trying the restaurant part soon."}
{"text":"Awesome way to spend an afternoon but be prepared for some pretty steep prices. I would recommend coming to the Brickworks during the week- you may run into some school trips but overall it's a lot less crowded than the weekends. The cafe is a cute little place to have lunch. I thought the cafe's kitchen was pretty unique looking- industrial/farm feel with open displays of both baked goods and loads of pots, pans, and jarred goods. Just different from the everyday restaurant. The menu features seasonal ingredients in what I would say are mainly French inspired dishes and also has a few interesting items that change daily.   For lunch, my mom and I split the Bricklayer meat board for $20. This one is actually a good value considering the amount of food you get. I believe their selection changes often but we had smoked trout, a couple of different shaved salamis, prosciutto, chicken liver pate, and some pork terrine. All the meats and the fish were quite good with the exception of the terrine, which needed more seasoning. The board came with some spicy mustard and pickled veg. The pot of herbed flatbreads that came with it was rustic and tasted amazing (flatbreads are seldom an exciting part of any meal but in this case are worthy of a mention). There is no cheese on this board for all you cheese lovers but you can order some on the side.  We also split a small version of the St Lawrence Salad- beware the small $14 portion (vs the $19 large) is HUGE so don't bother ordering the large unless you plan to share it with like 5 people. The salad itself was pretty good- nothing that I haven't really seen before but I like the fruit/veg combo. The brown butter dressing I read rave reviews about is definitely good- very diff from the typical tangy dressings we are all used to. One downside is that after about 10 minutes the butter starts to solidify over everything in the salad and that's when it hits you how much butter you just consumed. If you're going for a healthy salad, I'd say skip this one or go for a long walk on the grounds after...  Lastly, I practically inhaled their infamous blueberry scone. As many other yelpers wrote, this was indeed the best blueberry scone I've ever had...best scone period. Just super soft and really balanced in flavour. I could go on and on but just try it- you won't regret it.  I'd also recommend skipping their desserts and instead getting one of the amazing, made from scratch popsicles at the little garden store next door. They have amazing flavour combos (ie. watermelon/lemon/mint)- YUM!  Overall, this cafe is worth visiting if you are making a trip to the brickworks. The prices for many of the items are way too high in my opinion but you can get super full by sharing a few items that are reasonably priced (our bill with two non-alcoholic drinks came to $48)."}
{"text":"This review is largely for their take away cafe counter.  NOT ALWAYS WORTH THE WAIT On weekends, there is usually a substantial (15 min) line up just to order food and another 10 minute additional wait for most food.  The line up is indoors which is nice for inclement weather.  They post signs saying food is made to order, so allow 15 minutes for preparation --- but this is only visible once inside by the register.  So, really plan on not eating for another 30 minutes when you get in line on weekend mornings or midday (even when the farmer's market takes place).    I think it is silly that they do not have a second cash register by now to expedite payment with this problem existing for years.  I don't mind waiting for freshly prepared food, but I do mind waiting in line that long unnecessarily because of poor planning.  Perhaps they could post some of the popular menu items on a chalkboard stand outside or through the glass window to expedite decision making at the register on weekends.  Maybe play music somewhat audibly to make the long wait more enjoyable.  Perhaps try what other I have seen successful restaurants do: Have staff walk down the line to take orders to get food started since payment and menu decisions seem to be the real bottleneck.  FOOD Somewhat sweet biscuit breakfast sandwiches are great and have improved since opening, with biscuits being larger and more tender now.  The sausage in biscuit sandwiches is okay and obviously formed in house (don't expect Egg McMuffin sausage, it's much thicker, a bit sweeter, less spicy).  Trout biscuit sandwiches are a treat and a good differentiator.  Baked sweets (cookies, brownie/blondie bars) are hit or miss; I have yet to have any that are truly craveable.  Still, I really appreciate the effort of using real ingredients and making them from scratch.  Owner, Brad Long, is big on buying local, being sustainable; so, you are paying a bit more for that.  DRINK Espresso (Rufino brand) and cappuccinos are divine.   They don't sell disposable plastic bottles of water, but rather sell reusable, collapsable (tap-filled?) water bags with sipper spouts that have a caribiner attached.  They make their own syrups for Italian sodas, which tend be creative flavours. I was extremely disappointed in their hibiscus Italian soda.  Hibiscus is normally tangy and refreshing; when steeped, it makes a rich, red colour.  So, I can't understand why the Italian sodas I ordered barely had a tinge of pink (1/4 the color of blush/rose wine); they tasted awful from being horribly diluted.  I'm all about subtle flavours and not having something sickeningly sweet, but these were overly diluted.  I felt ripped off since it cost $9.61 for a large and small drink, plus we waited thirsty in line after a long hike only to be met with disappointment.  The drinks were not very cold and did not have any ice in them, so we had to ask for it and have further delay.      PARKING Paid parking in the lot; don't forget your license plate number since it is ticketless parking.   There is often problems paying with credit cards in the parking payment machine, so allow extra time or bring cash.  The machine by the farmer's market seems to work better for credit card than the machine by the restaurant. Free shuttle busses from select TTC stations, however, I have found them to be infrequent at times.  ACCESSIBILITY Very easy access for wheelchairs and walkers.  Slightly sloped from parking lot to the door.  Chairs can pull out for wheelchairs.  I do not recall arms on chairs, though.  There are handicapped washroom stalls on ground level (no stairs)."}
{"text":"This was my second time at the Cafe. The first time I'd stopped by was on a Friday evening with a friend. We had grabbed a quick drink at the bar. The bar has an excellent selection of microbreweries on tap and in bottle.  This time it was a Sunday. When I arrived at 12:30 the Cafe was packed but by 1:30 everything had died down and alot of tables started to open up. I was solo this time around having biked in from the Danforth along Pottery Road. Having waited for an hour for the chaos to die down I was starved.   I asked the hostess for a shady spot for 1 on the patio if possible. She got me a great table but unfortunately there were 100s of wasps flying around the patio. I flagged this for her and she was honest to say we get alot of wasps. They do have a solution set up that attracts wasps to jars but the jars are so close to the tables it doesn't work. Just a warning for patio seekers...Locate yourself away from the wooden fences that outline the patio  I asked the hostess if I could switch to a table inside. She flagged that she only had space at the bar. I asked if I could eat at the bar. She said yes. I said sounds great. When I walked to the Bar I noted tons of empty 2 person tables that by the time I had loft were still open. I note that Cafe Belong might not be pro-single person.   I had a homemade soda and the Wild Blueberry Pancakes (25 dollars with tax and tip). Although very expensive, the meal was absolutely tasty and had me wanting more. The service from the bartender was both helpful and good. The spot has great atmosphere.  Although a great eating experience I'd be hesitant to come back alone again.  ***1/2"}
{"text":"This a great place for all kinds of activity! The brunch is great but the price is little high for my wallet. Overall service was great and the food was good.   Only recommendation I suggest is a little change on the brunch menu. Other than that the experience was great!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, love the ambience. The server Evan (I think that was his name, something with E) was very knowledgeable and attentive to my dietary needs. I wish I could have spoken to the manager to tell him how pleased I was but it was very busy. I will be back again and have told several friends about my amazing experience."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch and ordered the kale and caramelized onion Benedict. It was ok but not worthy of $22-24 (can't remember the exact price but for sure it was above $20) Also their biscuit which the Benedict is served on was very dense and not the best biscuit I've had.  Also their filtered coffee is terrible! Extremely bitter! Stick to espresso based drinks.  Overall, great space and service; however, the food wasn't top-notch for this price point."}
{"text":"Does it get any better than having a great lunch on a patio at Brickworks? This is our favourite restaurant around Bayview Avenue, Toronto. Best to come weekday where Brickworks is less busy."}
{"text":"Crazy. A brunch menu that dares charge 27 dollars for eggs benedict. it is difficult to comprehend on what planet that would be a acceptable price. It is particularly bewildering given the family nature of the brickworks so we conclude the menu prices are designed to both ensure brunch is Not a key focus for them and also to ensure they keep the riff raff out.  The sticker shock is such that there is sooo much room for disappointment that we opt to share the 21 dollar oatmeal pancakes with cooked pears and apples and a little side of ricotta. we forgo the extra 4 bucks warm maple syrup would have added to costs. The quinoa porridge is also ordered. it comes in at a song. only 11 bucks.  Our caution is rewarded.   the pancakes are truly unremarkable. At this price point i would expect something a lot more impressive. The accompanying compote is clearly an after thought, the cakes lack seasoning and the ricotta is store bought.  Quinoa porridge has no flavour at all. I hate it when chefs do this: innovate at the expense of taste. It could have really used some syrup but then you are paying 15 bucks for porridge.  I am not cheap. i will spend the money on good food. My time working in restaurant kitchens has typically made me very generous when it comes to execution. The trade off though between cost and product is very clearly absent on the brunch menu at Belong."}
{"text":"It was a spontaneous Sunday and I really wanted brunch - we decided to go to Café Belong. I heard about this place for a long time but because it's not exactly in the core of Downtown Toronto, it was a bit out of the way. I'm not exactly sure if there is any public transportation that can take you there from downtown core but we drove there.     We walked into the building that houses Café Belong and it immediately reminded me of a cozy ski lounge. Aside from the restaurant (which was not hard to find at all, as it was inside the main building), there is a little store that you could visit if you're waiting for a spot. We didn't make reservation but was offered seats at the bar.  The server had recommended the Eggs Be (with House Ham - $27) to us, and we also got the Pancakes ($21). Although they do charge for maple syrup, our server gave it to us on the house. When the food came, I was definitely blown away. The pancakes were very fluffy, having eaten the pancakes at Mildred and School before, this was definitely on par with those two brunch places. While we were eating, we also saw them make the pancake batches right in front of us - talk about being fresh. But the dish that really amazed me was the Eggs Be with House Ham. The portion was good for two people to share but after eating one of them, I wanted the second one. It was perfect, the poached eggs, once broken, leaked onto the buttermilk biscuit  and the combination was heavenly. You really have to try to get all the little veggies that they put on the side on the bread as well and dip as much of the Hoolandaise Saue because everything just compliments each other.     If you are heading there and must try one thing, I would highly recommend the Eggs Be with House Ham. AMAZING!!! Aside from the food, the ambience is casual and I love how so much natural sunlights were able to get into the restaurant. I do agree that this restaurant could be a bit pricey, but this place is definitely worth a revisit."}
{"text":"It's 2017 and minimalism is back!  Minimal amounts of service, minimal water in our glasses, and minimal attention to pretty much anything that should be done in a timely manner. So if you are a local camel with nothing better to do over the course of 2hrs, then this is THE place for you!  Graze on overpriced (though locally sourced) salads, accompanied with some very tasty brisket. Just make sure to pre-eat before eating here....or you'll go home famished...and poor."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast / brunch and did not really have an idea of what to expect. Fortunately we ended up having some seriously great tasting food.   I had the squash salad with smoked duck, greens and soft boiled egg. It was so tasty. All ingredients were very fresh and full of flavour.  (They use all local and organic products,many of which you can get at the market at Brickworks on saturday morning)  My wife had a squash soup and the frittata with a small green salad. The soup was amazing and the fritatta was also pretty good.  We also had pretty tasty fruit juices. I liked my blueberry lime-aid mix a lot.   Bit pricy for a quick brunch though, but sometimes you have to give yourself a treat. I want to go back here for dinner."}
{"text":"Had lunch with some dear friends. We don't get together often and have made it something of a tradition to pick special places for lunch when we do.  Started with Bricklayers Board - small but yummy - perfect appetizer. Had ahi tuna, fried chicken, arctic char and lobster roll. All incredible, especially fried chicken - crispy but not greasy. For dessert - chevre cheesecake, lemon poundcake - out of this world."}
{"text":"Came in for brunch.  Their french toast is pretty enormous - an interesting spin since the slices of bread are really thick.  I got the stratford sandwich which was pretty solid.  The eggs Benedict comes on a biscuit - which wasn't really doing it for me - also had some caramelized onions which was just okay.  All in all, the ambience and funky location (former brick factory converted into a farmer's market) makes this place decent.  Servers were nice and friendly.  The food itself is just okay."}
{"text":"Second time at the cafe for brunch. I was extremely pleased on my first visit, and just as pleased on my second.   On my first visit a couple months ago, I had a brunch-type item consisting of rabbit sausage, potatoes, caramelized onions and little sides of a jammy item and a mustard-y item. Having absolutely no expectations, I was very impressed with the execution of everything, but especially the flavour profile of the sausage/mustard/jammy things all together. One of my dining companions had an item with hollandaise, and she proclaimed it \"the best hollandaise of all time\". I would have to say that I couldn't disagree.   The second time around, I had a more lunch-type item of mussels and fries. The mussels come with bread, but I wanted the fries too. The accompanying white wine and tomato sauce was competent, but a little salty. The mussels themselves were delicious little gems, perfectly cooked and very fresh tasting.   I have to start a separate paragraph for the fries, because they were just that good. Crispy, fluffy, hot, salty, comes-with-mayo-AND-ketchup, crunchy little nuggets good. Would return for fries alone.   Because I'm supposed to be on a sugar-free post-holiday diet (natch), I didn't order a dessert, but instead opted to eat someone else's. Sticky toffee pudding made a round of the table to rave reviews. A lovely baked dessert which was crunchy caramel-y on the outside and soft, tender, molasses, dates, gooey on the inside. Topped with a dollop of whipped cream which looked like a little cloud.   Cafe Belong has impressed me twice in a row, and based on the competency of their brunch would like to go back and try a dinner. I noted on the menu that they had family style meals for evening service. Vegetarian, poultry, beef and chef's choice were the options, I think. Would be neat to try. They also have a la carte options, I just think the family style option seems a little cozier."}
{"text":"Definitely a good place to stop by after hiking the Don Valley Trails.  The interior was welcoming and bright.  I loved the feel and look of the place with the simple designs and exposed kitchen. Plus the displays of the pots and industrial lighting made it a very casual ambience.  The lunch menu, although small seemed varied for everyone's palates, but found it a bit heavy and pricey which would be more suitable for a dinner menu.  We were hoping to have brunch, but it wasn't offered during the weekday, so we opted for the Bricklayers Board which consisted of various charcuterie and pickled goodness. Presentation was very lovely and the server explained everything on the board. Plus it was served with more than enough flatbreads which was a nice change to see. It was exactly what we needed as it wasn't too heavy and we were very satisfied.  Our server was friendly and attentive, but not intrusive and always came at the right time to refill our water glasses. The glasses were never empty.  Overall, a nice and relaxing break from the city.  Going during the weekday was definitely lucky for us since the place wasn't busy compared to during the weekend as it can be extremely busy and noisy."}
{"text":"The space is impressive (North end of the garden building at Brickworks) and it looks like they have a busy little kitchen going on there. I just stopped by for a coffee at the start of the farmer's market on Saturday. They didn't open till' just a tad after 8am....while there are literally 150-200 people already at the market for the setup/first dibs. Coffee was OK...maybe a little weak. Open earlier, you lazy bums!  Looks like a beauty place for dinner, mind you."}
{"text":"This place is out of the way for sure but if you make it you will be rewarded with a great experience. The food and service were terrific. The ambiance is nice. I was there as part of an event but I will definitely check it out again."}
{"text":"I don't like to write bad reviews. Maybe it's bad karma or maybe I would just rather focus on the better establishments in Toronto--and there are plenty. In fact, I haven't bothered to write a review about any restaurant in awhile. My experience at Cafe Belong last Saturday evening was so completely incompetent that I need to share my experience with others.  Let's begin with the brusque greeting by a host who would rather not like to be in the hospitality sector. Aggressive in tone, he asked if we had a reservation (yes we did). He then put us through a needlessly tiresome and aggravating process of seating us at one of the many appropriate tables that we wanted.   Service was slow. It took 30 minutes to get a cocktail and there weren't that many diners present. Ingredients were missing with no effort in making some kind of substitution. Wine was off--\"It must be because the bottle was in the sun all afternoon,\" was the reply. Food was mediocre, cold, or both: the miserly pieces of duck in the duck salad were dry; the 12-ounce steak contained 5 ounces of fat and grizzle. I had to get up to find steak knives, only to remind the server that we needed two of them. Nobody asked about coffee or dessert or whether or not we were able to digest the massive chunks of grizzle on an underwhelming piece of meat.   There was no manager on the duty--I asked to see one. Nobody responded. This is clearly a tourist trap par excellence, or simply a restaurant so blessed in its location they barely have to lift a finger to satisfy their clientele. And they don't!"}
{"text":"tl:dr: Overpriced for a meal. Probably a nice place to stop for a drink. Great service.  I wanted to treat my parents to a nice dinner after a day-long 40km bike trip from the Brickworks down to Cherry St, all the way across the city to Humber Bay, Mimico, and back.   Cafe Belong does a family-style prix-fixe farm-to-table dinner special on Sundays starting at 5pm, and I thought this would be a great choice.  For $47 a head we got:  - A starter salad with mustard dressing - various greens plus tomatoes and radishes - Mains: roast beef, grilled asparagus, Yorkshire pudding, and mashed potatoes with wild leeks - Dessert: a rhubarb \"tiramisu\"  I substituted a curry carrot mash for the roast beef in my meal (vegetarian), which brought the prix fixe price for my meal down to $32.  [The Pros]  * Great service! We loved our waitress - so attentive and pleasant, and she was literally the one waitress serving the entire outside patio area. Quite impressive.  * Large serving sizes - we felt quite full after a day-long bike ride and hike around the park, which is impressive, as my parents always lament the small serving sizes at pricier restaurants.  [The Meh]  * I guess it's because they're the only restaurant anywhere near the Brickworks, but for the price we were pretty underwhelmed by the food. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't worth $47 a head. Everything was just...very okay.  * There was a noticeable bitter alcohol taste in the rhubarb tiramisu. I know tiramisu is supposed to contain liquor of some kind, but this was way too much to be pleasant.  [ verdict ] Nice for a quick drink around the Brickworks, but next time, I'd take dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner because there was a blog that said the charcuterie board was one of the top 10 in Toronto. The board was good however half the board wasn't a charcuterie for example there was grilled sausage on it and crispy bacon..minus a star for non traditional \"charcuterie\". The foie mousse was fantastic though.  Had the paparadelle pasta as my entree..the pasta was fresh but for $27 I wouldn't say it was worth it.  Dessert we had the chocolate mousse jar which was decadent and delicious.  Ordered an old fashion and it was definitely on par with other places. It was done well.  Dining experience was excellent. Wait staff was attentive."}
{"text":"Tucked away within the Evergreen Brick Works, Cafe Belong appears to be the only place to grab a cup of coffee.   The lineup is pretty long and the cafe only has a few seats and one table so clearly it's meant to be takeout only. However they have a restaurant section (that does not allow coffee area patrons to sit in).  Service is short and staff members did not seem rushed considering the number of customers lining up (you'd think they would speed things up).  I ordered an iced Americano and it was nothing special with a large amount of ice. The pastries look really tasty - I'll have to try it next time."}
{"text":"This review is primarily for the takeout counter.  The blueberry scones THE BEST.  So flavourful, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside.  Their biscuits are also marry the perfect balance of crispiness and fluffy-ness.  The homemade pop is a nice treat, and their lattes are pretty good.  As for the restaurant.  I remember lemon butter that was served with the bread which was nice, and a wonderful salad (it's been a while, so I can't remember the name of it), but I also remember not being totally floored by the main dish that I ordered.    If it was just the bakery, I would have given it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Wow quite a busy place... but lots to choose from they have eggs, pancakes, french toast, Lattes, fresh juice and much more.   If you're Evergreen Brickwork, its worth a stop."}
{"text":"Serving staff was pleasant, food was okay but definitely not worth the prices they charge. Patio would be so much better if they invested in more than ONE patio umbrella. The guy who seated us was terrible! Restaurant was only @ 10% capacity inside and 30% capacity outside but he insisted that if we chose to sit outside that we could not move inside! We were there at 2pm which seemed to be outside of there revenue hours but he was still so unaccommodating. I recommend packing a picnic or bringing take-out from somewhere else and take advantage of the tables outside."}
{"text":"Come early for parking purposes. Lots going on today, holy crappers! And find out if anything else is going on here because space is limited. We were here for the Brewers Backyard event so I figured we might want to put something on the stomach before indulging in the belle provinces golden nectar. The beer sampling and munching on a fruit and cheese plate was great and definitely look forward to the next round, next season, good times all around, thanks Jennifer K. for the heads up on the event itself, it was an awesome afternoon out. Cheers! Next round's on me!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent (seriously excellent), although it was quite pricey for lunch.  I'd definitely go back for dinner...  Apparently the ingredients for the items on the menu are mostly locally sourced, organic, and sustainable. I've also been told that many of the items will be from the farmers who show up at the market every weekend.  The atmosphere is airy, and open, as is the kitchen.  I'm sure that the smells from the kitchen will be amazing during their dinner service.  The wait staff are excellent, just attentive enough, and very polite.  When I went (the second day after it opened), they didn't have their liquor license yet, but I was told that they'd be getting it imminently.  I was also told that there'd be a huge patio space outside as well.  It's going to be great!  They have reverse osmosis water that the can carbonate - very refreshing.  You can also add a number of \"made in the restaurant\" syrups to the water as well.  There are lots of options; I had lime, and other person I was with had Cherry.  They were really nice, but very sweet (some, I'm sure would say too sweet).  Being at the Brickworks has it's benefits - there's lots of parking close by.  It also has a drawback - since its very green at the Brickworks there's no Air Conditioning (good air circulation though).  This is going to be a great little oasis that you can go to and get away from it all.  I can't wait to see how it matures..."}
{"text":"Excellent service, lovely ambiance and a very selective menu from which everything we tried was so good!"}
{"text":"I found Cafe Belong to generally be pretty pricey, and in most ways I was disappointed with my meal. I do like the Brick Works and the general feel of the place.  I ordered the grilled beef hanger, which was cooked to a nice medium rare but was unfortunately rather tasteless. My companions all ordered the fish of the day (rainbow trout) which was only okay.  However, dessert almost made the entire meal worthwhile. Most of of us ordered the Montforte chèvre cheesecake and one person ordered the panna cotta. The cheesecake looked stunning, with the plate sprinkled with small edible flowers. And, while not the best dessert I've ever had, it did taste pretty darn good. (I just wish that the americano I ordered to go with it was better -- it wasn't any better than an average coffee. Very disappointing that.) I had a spoon of the panna cotta and that tasted pretty good too. Richer than a panna cotta I'd had at Terroni years ago.  To sum things up, I'd maybe stop in for dessert and try my luck with an espresso or maybe just their regular coffee if I was in the area. But I probably won't go back for dinner."}
{"text":"Obscene prices which is quite ironic considering the motto of this place is \"sustainability\".  IF the prices were about half , the food would receive a pass grade. If the goal of the visit to brickworks is this cafe, don't bother."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a family brunch on family day weekend atCB - the daily pancakes were the standout dish. I would rate CB with three and a half stars had it not been for the 40 minute wait after ordering  and still the food was barely warm. My husband's beef brisket dish was dried out. After our food arrived - we did not see our sever again until it was time to pay. Good food - super slow service. My advice to management is discontinue the takeout cafe and concentrate on the dining experience especially at these prices."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant for a birthday dinner with a group of 14.  Firstly, this place is really hard to find even with a GPS. Its tucked in a random plaza/industrial area off the highway.  Secondly, even with a large parking lot you need to pay for parking, $3 for 1 hour or $8 from 6pm to the next morning. The thing is, you don't even display the ticket on the dash board, they,all fine you $30,dollars if you don't go enter your license plate on this machine thing.  Thirdly, the selection  for entrees is quite small, 7-8 choices, I got the fish and chips. The plate with came with 3 small pieces of fish, they didn't season it very well so it was quite bland. The fries were decent but I didn't pay $26 for fries. My friend ordered the pork dish, the portion was small for the price and the dish was underwhelming. For the higher price tag and disappointing food I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I came here on the family day long weekend brunch. We were expecting a lot of hustle and bustle so luckily we had reserved a table online earlier (I would recommend doing that as the phone kept going to their Voice Mail) .  After making it through the huge line ups at the entrance at their take out outlet I was greeted by the host and seated immediately. The place has a nice airy and open feel. I already knew I had to try the french toast after being seduced by the pics on a Yelp friend's profile. I was able to convince a friend to share a main and have the french toast as dessert (a good combo if you ask me) We had the following items Scrambled egg, Fries, Smoked trout and Potato Tart. The food took its time arriving and the service was a bit slow as the place was slammed. Apple Tart and Egg didn't fare well. The side of Salad was OK. The main tart was devoid of taste and wasn't seasoned well. The boiled egg was cooked way too long and the yolk was grey all over the side.  French Toast despite being a Vegas Style Monstrosity was good. Hint of banana in the bread with the center being nice and goeey. Apple compote with cinnamon and maple syrup helped it.  Good stuff and recommended.  The fellow diners seemed happy with their choices. I wish I had convinced me fellow diners to do a BYOW as it would have completed a good brunch.  There was even a dessert menu  If you are here and you know the concept of this spot i.e. everything green and not mean! so if this idea appeals to you this is the place to be.   With the ambiance and ethically sourced food I would say 3.5 Stars."}
{"text":"I like having brunch here because of its nice atmosphere and after brunch you can take a nice walk around the place. Food is generally good but overpriced, I guess because of their location. Service is good or bad depends on who's serving, coffee is great. The one time I ordered egg benedict, my eggs were overcooked which was quite a big let down.  Whatever they missed on food and service they made up for it by their location and ambience, that's why I always have a nice time there. So, a 4 star experience."}
{"text":"Super disappointing - well, maybe disappointment is not the right word because I went in with low expectations based on the information I had.  Website says the restaurant is open from 10 am - 10 pm, but, as with the entire experience, that was a lie.  We got there at 300 pm and the seated portion of the restaurant was only serving drinks, not food.  So we lined up for take out, and they don't serve cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches, just cookies or a pre-packaged \"tabule\" salad.  (i put in quotes because it's a disgrace to the tabule concept).  So this salad. My boyfriend said, upon tasting, \"This is like we are in prison.\"  It was bland and just...something was not right.  Like being mushy but also tough?  Ugh.  As there are literally no other options around there at that time (you're in the middle of the forest, essentially, and for some reason the farmer's market closes before I was even awake), we ate it.  But it would be great if they could indicate before you line up that they have NO options left for take out, so you don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Brad Belong needs to return to take charge of his kitchen. His absence has sent the food quality spiraling downwards. The food used to be good at one point. I regret to see that the present chef prepares pretentious and overpriced food.  I brunched there last weekend. I ordered their version of the eggs Benedict. What I got were overcooked poached eggs that were almost a soft boiled consistency, on a bed of whole leaf kale (which at the very least should have been cut into strips before being wilted), and what seemed like rehydrated shiitake mushrooms, tough stem ends and all.  I know of novice food enthusiasts who can pick better quality ingredients, and prepare them far better than the fare I had to endure. The only preparation of theirs that I found redeeming was the coffee.  While the staff is generally friendly and helpful, and seem otherwise competent, the waitress serving me seemed offended that I asked the eggs be redone to be more runny, the way poached eggs should be. (I did leave her a decent tip, though.) The chef however, I believe to be either lazy, or incompetent, or both.  The only reason I give it one star is because I can't seem to post this without"}
{"text":"It's a fact: I hate that a chef would name a restaurant after himself. It's just culinary narcissism. I know you have a name, but really?? Does that name have to \"Be Long\" to the restaurant as well?   I didn't want to come here, but I got caught in a massive downpour at the Brickworks this weekend and and was trying to wait it out until I could ride my bike home. A SNAFU like this calls for a drink.  I had the Green Sangria, which was recommended by our waiter, and turned out to be surprisingly delicious. It wasn't too sweet and the basil syrup was spot on. For $10 this cocktail was worth it. My friend had the El Diablo with Tequila, Cassis syrup, House made ginger ale and lime. This was also delicious.  I wasn't super hungry after sampling a few of the delights at the market food stands. But the brunch prices were very off putting. Their egg dish was $20! A $19 sandwich and a ribeye for $46? Tell me how an almost $50 steak sells at brunch...  Their seasonal menus for dinner do look a bit more interesting, so I might be tempted to come back for an evening meal but I'm not into going out and spending an arm and a leg on eggs. That's just insane."}
{"text":"I have been to cafe belong twice and won't be back. Service is very slow and the food, although good, is overpriced. The take out bar might be a better option than the restaurant, although it is also overpriced you won't spend an hr waiting for brunch."}
{"text":"This place is called cafe belong? Well my girlfriend and I didn't belong here. We tried to get in on the weekend and we could see empty seats and the server said we are full and we are closing down the kitchen, at 2pm? I heard many great things about this place however our first interaction was horrible. When we asked is there somewhere else that we could eat or have a drink on the grounds the \"host at café belong\" said i don't know and without checking with anyone else she turned us away. I hope she isnt planning a hospitality career. The only good thing about that place was the weather!"}
{"text":"Ho hum.  This is a sad sad place that is not likely long for this world.  Today, I spent $90 on lunch for two without any alcohol.   I was drawn there by Now Magazine's top ten of 2011.  I think it must have gone downhill since whenever Now was there last.   The space itself is quite nice except for the constant din of what sounds like a road repair crew's industrial generator just outside your window.  It turns out that's actually the building's heating system.. Unlike a road crew, it never goes away.    The waitress was just barely pleasant.  She was a bit slow, a bit incompetent and had a way of making you think that she was really above this station in life - and not in the snarky way that younger staff do - this time, we actually believed it ourselves.     I asked the waitress about the soup of the day.  She said it was carrot.  Carrot with ginger or peanut?  I asked.  Nope, just carrot she replied.  The carrot soup came with some sort of cheese and some sort of chutney.  We'll never know more than that.    Ironically, the soup tasted nothing like carrots.  It tasted more like squash, and mostly, it just plain sucked.  Roasted chicken had some nice flavourings going on, but it was dry.  I'd tell you about the stuffing that comes with the chicken but it arrived without stuffing.    Bacon-wrapped venison was cooked perfectly.  Jerusalem artichoke hearts were excellent.    Overall, this place is underwhelming, overpriced and has a stench of death about it."}
{"text":"Food presentation is nice, taste is good and service is really poor. Would not come back here.  Atmosphere: 5/5 Price: 3/5 Presentation: 5/5 Taste: 4/5  Portion: 2/5  Service: 2/5  Atmosphere: Very nice and relaxing atmosphere at Evergreen Brickswork. The interior is nicely decorated with industry/rustic look. There is an outdoor patio area as well with umbrellas, perfect for a sunny day. Larger group tables are harder to seat so this place is probably ideal for groups of 4.   Price: This is an upscale restaurant so it is priced on the higher side. Had brunch here and was over $30 for poached eggs benedict and around $20 for blueberry pancakes.  Presentation: Everything was beautifully presented and instagram worthy!   Taste: Taste was pretty good.   Portion: Portions are on the smaller side.   Service: The wait for a table here on a Sunday afternoon was extremely long (45 minute wait). Service is also very poor. The staff were friendly but not too helpful or knowledgable."}
{"text":"Had brunch there this morning with the family. The food itself is mixed, some dishes where pretty good, some were just outright bad.  At the price they were charging though, I would have expected a lot more.   My wife ordered the Pancakes and Mac and Cheese.  It was $19 for three pancakes with whipped cream and compote.  That's it, nothing else on the plate.  More importantly, I've ordered better pancakes at a quarter of the price.  The Mac and Cheese  was dry and had no flavour, it would have tasted better if I just boiled some pasta with salt water.  I ordered a quiche which was the Savoury Pie of the day.  The quiche itself was quite tasty, so no complains there.   At $15, it was reasonable, but not a bargain by any stretch of the imagination.  I thought it took longer than expected for the dishes to be served, bothering on unacceptable wait.  Service itself was ok, no real complains but nothing special came to mind either.  If you go there, expected to be overcharged and underwhelmed,"}
{"text":"The ingredients were indeed fresh!  The Tartine was like an open sandwich.  I liked the ingredients on top of the toast but I did think that the toast was over-toasted.  The bottom of the toast from both ends were charred black (and thus very crunchy and hard to chew through).  I avoided eating those areas.  However, the middle of the toast where the bulk of the ingredients sat was great.  Our dessert was the Strawberry Pavlova.  This had a meringue and macerated Ontario strawberries with a lavender whipped cream, blueberry syrup, and lemon curd.  This was beautiful!  It was like a work of art (fine dining perhaps).  There were some edible flowers on the plate too which gave some texture to the dessert.  We both found the dessert overall was way too sweet.  The ingredients were once again very fresh.  I would have liked to share this dessert to divide up the sugar intake a bit that day.  I'm very glad that I got to try Cafe Belong with C!  Maybe I'll find myself here for dinner or brunch or lunch in the future (although I do think that their prices for the regular items are a little high...) -- I'm not writing off their restaurant but definitely wouldn't run back here any time soon."}
{"text":"On Thursday June the 7th, I took my photography group to the Evergreen Brick Works for a photo shoot. We congregated at Cafe Belong where we enjoyed excellent coffee and delicious blueberry scones. We returned for lunch and again the service was good and the food very tasty. This was the good part of the experience. Unbeknownst to me, one of my group asked a server if he could take her picture. The woman said yes and a beautiful photo of a smiling woman was captured. Apparently the manager of the cafe did not want photos taken of the staff and asked my colleague not to do this again. Later, not aware of the aforementioned exchange with my colleague,  I took two photos, shooting through glass and into the sunlight streaming in from a west facing window. Any people in the cafe were unrecognizable. The photos were a study in reflections and shape. A woman from the restaurant,  came to our table, quite upset telling us not to take photos. She was followed by another staff member who was obnoxious and rude and demanded that an apology be given to some unidentifiable customers. I offered that I took the shots and since I was told that the customers complained, I entered the cafe, showed some customers the photos and deleted them, then and there. The customers said nothing. I don't believe that anyone had made a complaint. Afterwards, I went back to the cafe to discuss with the woman, who advised me that she was the manager and her staff member that the manner in which we were spoken to was rude. I did what they asked, even though it was unnecessary. The staff person, a baker at best, was belligerent, extremely confrontational and advised me that he had a high degree of self confidence. The erstwhile psychologist advised me that I could not handle his confrontational style because I lacked self confidence. The woman identified herself as the manager while the baker carried on yelling at me. The manager should have diffused this situation by sending the baker, the erstwhile psychologist, back to the baking area, should have thanked me for my apology and the deletion of the images and due to being so rudely treated, invited us back at a later date with the offer of say a coffee gratis. Of course this is not what happened. She allowed the incident to further escalate. I eventually left the cafe advising the manager and the erstwhile psychologist that this incident would be good material on social media. We left the building thinking that this chapter was over. Nope, not so fast. The manager followed us out and continued to harangue us. She was later accompanied by another employee, a cook, who was doubly rude and advised us to get a good lawyer should we tell our story on social media.  We were originally a group of 12. Only 6 of us had to endure this unbelievable lack of civility. To think that a manager would not only allow but also contribute to be part of a  yelling match in her cafe, in front of numerous patrons, is very hard to understand.The manager and her staff would benefit from training in customer service and anger management. A little touch of common sense would also help. However, this cannot be taught. While the customer is not always right, the customer is never wrong. It is up to management and the staff to ensure that a customer leaves the premises without incredulity, anger and feeling that they were abused.it us most unfortunate as I live in the area, visit the Brick Works often and used to enjoy being a patron of the cafe and the restaurant. Not only has this experience soured me on the cafe but it has also impacted my desire to ever return to the Brick Works."}
{"text":"Last minute call for Sunday dinner found me at Evergreen Brickworks' Cafe Belong for a event sponsored by American Express.  Five courses all paired with Stratus wines, with Chef Brad Long in attendance.  Cafe Belong serves good honest food made with fresh local ingredients.   Chef Long is a firm believer in honest food preparation and the philosophy of food as fuel, love and nutrition (medicine).  It is a philosophy that shines through his tasty dishes.  Every dish was wholesome, well prepared and delicious.    Ravioli in a mushroom broth set the tone for wholesome goodness.  Marinated sardines over a salad of caponata was bright and fresh.    Roast saddle of lamb was tender and flavorful paired nicely with a side of foraged kale and heirloom beans.  Filling and nutritious.   To finish, one course of fried montfort cheese with a sliver of honeycomb to add a touch of sweetness and the most spectacular slab of chocolatey goodness I've ever had.     The chocolate came from Oaxaca apparently, chock full of antioxidants and wonderfully enriching.    Needless to say, I really enjoyed the food at Cafe Belong.  It's food is devoid of pretension and very well prepared.   Great place for nice casual dinner."}
{"text":"For me, I never had anything like this type of food or meal, but everything I tried was different and tasty, from duck breast to a very local made green salad, I was pleasantly surprised by the meal and Alex our waitress was fantastic! I would eat here again!"}
{"text":"I rated this place a 3 but maybe if I could give half stars id give it a 3.5? Atmosphere is great and waiters are attentive. Food was good but not necessarily better than my other favorite brunch spots, however it was pricier hence the -.5 star.    Liked: -Eggs Be house ham  Okay:  -Side macaroni (not that cheesy flavored which I like. If you like a strong cheddar flavor this isn't for you) -lattes -eggs be trout (wasn't a huge fan of the fish Benny combo..)  Disliked: -Apple fritters were dry and unexciting taste wise, kind of reminded me of a plain donut with cinnamon sugar? SO SAD they didn't have pancakes this weekend"}
{"text":"cute place to go on a date or to catch up with your friends! This place has the most down to earth and hipster vibe to it.There are more windows than brick walls in this restaurant, allowing sunlight to beam through the restaurant on a beautiful Sunday  afternoon.  When you first walk in, you noticed alot of dogs at the front and then the crowd of cyclists and joggers lining up at the cafe before you can reach the host.  The good: delicious local food, comfortable atmosphere, lots of vitamin D. + you can shop around and/or take a hike after filling up your belly!  The bad: there's not much bad since everything was good but couldn't wrap my head around the pricing...why would pancakes + syrup cost more than a charcuterie board...   Recommendation: Make reservations!! order the charcuterie board!"}
{"text":"~~Jennifer Ks Head   vs   Mega French Toast~~  On a calm winter's sunday, I ventured out to an area known as Brickworks. There resides a Cafe and that Cafe belongs to Chef & Owner Brad Long. Cafe Belong, as I interpret it is a Modern Minimalistic Barnyard presense. The green winding Vine-like lights above becomes part of the focal point. Secondary vision is the view of beyond the floor-to-ceiling glass windows.  French Toast ($16.00)  Judging by ~Things-Larger-than-Jennifer K's Head~ standard, one will leave full. Banana Bread is a wise carb choice as it's simply a warm classic comfort food. Apple Cin Compote, Maple Syrup, Butter accompany 3 piece Brick-sized Toast. Exterior crisp while interior soft gooey, the latter might not be to everyone's liking.  Croque Ravine ($23.00)  Toscano, Glazed Ham, Caramelized Onion, Sunny Egg Open-Faced Croque. Topped with some pan-fried and possibly IMO over-seasoned Mixed Greens. May I add that this version appears much healthier than it's Closed-Face cousin?  Local, organic and sustainable has it's monetary additions, so does location. In Everygreen Brickworks, Cafe Belong has the Monopoly on Food & Bevs. 2.5'd Sure, the business needs to make monies to keep afloat, however...  When a Family of 2 Adults 4 Kids arrive and observe how little the Kids ordered... Brickworks is a family friendly destination, I just wish with that family and others  alike could have eaten decently without having to break the bank in the process.  A Kids plates bordering $10.00 would be a nice offering. Simply remove 2 of 3 pieces of French Toast and voila! Trust me, my Friend even said it was LARGE portion... and she normally never ever says anything is too MUCH. After so many bites of French Toast, it does get boring tired.  The Food concept & Space match the destination Brickworks nicely. Maybe something can be adjusted to accomodate more customers?   *** Jennifer K wasn't too excited about her T&T Supermarket ROTD.       This is her replacement ROTD otherwise known as JOTD[Jen-of-the-Day]"}
{"text":"I can update this review b/c the pastry team has opened up their own bake shop called Andrea's Gerrard St Bakery, which was in my opinion the best part of my Cafe Belong experience.  The food at the restaurant was def 3 stars, especially if I take-out the dessert, which again was prepped by the pastry people.    --------  Previous review:  This is a toughie!  I've been hear for dinner and am a regular here for their baked goods.   Here's my takeaway.  Dinner is OK.  Probably a 3*, but the baked goods/pastries are a 5*+++.  This places bakes my favorite scones (blueberry in the city) and their sourdough chocolate brownie is rich beyond belief.    Let me start with the scone.  As my mom pointed out, it's not really a scone.  It's crusty on the outside and amazingly cakey and fluffy on the inside.  There are lots of blueberries, which gives the scone a nice sweetness and tartness.  The best part is that they are baked fresh, so I typically get a warm scone, which is hard to beat for breakfast!!  I'm salivating as I write this!  As for dinner, I came here for my mom's b-day and we did the 5-course tasting.  Honestly, the dinner started off on a weak note.  There were two complimentary starts/amuses: mushrooms fritters and pickled veggies.  The mushrooms were super greasy.  Plus, we weren't told that they were complimentary, so we thought it was Course 1.  We then thought the pickles was Course 2, which got my parents really nervous that they were going to starve!  Thankfully, they redeemed themselves!  Once the actual courses started to come the food was solid.  Highlights be the brown butter salad (imagine: salad coated in butter!), seafood stew, the beef brisket.     The true highlight of this meal was, once again, their desserts.  They gave us 4 different desserts and each was delicious!  I don't know who bakes for them, but I want him/her to live at my house!    I should also mention that they were able to accommodate my veggie demands while the rest of my family had meat.  I also like that they have themed tasting menus: meat, seafood or veg...or something like that.    In closing, food needs some refinement and staffers need to explain the 5 course tasting better.  And, the patisserie chef deserves a raise!"}
{"text":"If I had to choose one word to describe Cafe Belong, I would choose the word \"limited\". For a cafe, they really do not seem to serve much. Today was my first time coming, and I would be hard pressed to make a repeat trip here.   Upon first looking at the menu, they have 1 veggie sandwich, 1 meat sandwich, chips, and a daily soup. They also have breakfast sandwiches on buttermilk biscuits, and a small assortment of baked goods. Their drink menu is considerably larger than this, but I did not buy a drink, so I did not pay much attention to their drink menu. Oh. I should mention that I ordered off their takeout menu. Their sandwich options (veggie and meat) are a daily selection, and you have to ask what they are, because they aren't written anywhere.   We got there around 1:30pm, and we were told there were no sandwiches left. At all. That limited our lunch options significantly. My friend opted for the sausage and egg biscuit ($9), and a small daily soup - cold asparagus soup ($5?). I wanted the egg and trout biscuit ($9), but was told that they did not have trout that day. I then went for their small soup and biscuit ($7.90 after tax?). If we're keeping track, this means they were out of their two sandwiches and their trout biscuit. That's a minimum of three larger food items missing from their minimal menu. Not a good sign.  The biscuits are said to be fresh, but my understanding of fresh is perhaps a tad fresher than theirs. Their biscuits sit in a basket on the display shelf. My biscuit was not stale, but it was not piping hot out of the oven either. The outside was crunchy, and the inside was not as fluffy or as flakey as I would have expected of a fresh biscuit.   The cold asparagus soup did not taste of asparagus. It was pureed until there were no chunks in it, and was almost a matcha green color, but all I can really say is that it was cold, mild, and had herbs in it (I thought I detected a hint of dill, but I could be wrong). After that small, cold soup and my biscuit, I felt as though I did not want to eat any longer, although I was not satisfied. I also felt like I had had all the greens I could stomach for the day. Now, about an hour and a half after eating it, my stomach is not particularly happy with me, although perhaps that is just because I am unaccustomed to having so much cold soup.  For the price and the food choices available, I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Reviewing based on Brunch only: very tasty, but certainly not a bargain brunch by any means.  Menu changes quite frequently but will always have the standard favourites: eggs benny, some type of pancake/french toast, etc. Everything has been delicious, their fries are fantastic and scones are some of the best in the city. Portions are also very healthy so a brunch will definitely last you until dinner.  If you're headed to check out the farmers market or one of the events at Brickworks, definitely worth a stop!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem inside Evergreen Brickworks. Definitely give it a try. The menu is quite wholesome and earthy. We ordered several things and enjoyed everything. Definitely try the in-house made simple syrup soda's, they are delicious with unique flavors like lavender which you can mix to make your own concoction. The cocktails are great here also."}
{"text":"A large and pretty restaurant at Evergreen Brickworks. The large windows let the light in and the small fresh flowers on the table are a lovely touch. The service was ok, the waitress was really trying to upsell.   Had lunch there and got the fish and chips, they were tempura battered so it was light and the fish felt fresh. It came with two pieces, the portion looked small at first and ended up being fine for myself. It also came with slaw, it was a nice brightness to the deep fried fish however the carrot strings were so long and oddly cut it was hard to eat without getting it everywhere. Their house pickles were good and had variety of pickles, onions, beets, beans etc.  I also got the chocolate raspberry jar for dessert, it was beautifully presented with edible flowers, caramel layer, chocolate crumbs and topped with whipped cream, it was really (really) delicious! Their sodas are also great, they have house syrups and you can mix flavours (I usually go with ginger jasmine)"}
{"text":"We stopped in for something before walking around and the blueberry scone just came out of the oven so we shared one. It was the best ever for my husband and me and it was a memorable one...I'm trying to figure out how to go back to get some on my current trip. It was that good. It was moist more like and biscuit and not dry like a typical scone...and it being so warm...it was the best ever! Must try it!"}
{"text":"First off I'd say 5 stars for effort!  Cafe Belong has a great menu, not too overwhelming and with a lot of character ie. Lentils of the day was w duck confetti. Each dish showed thought and care and I'd say for the size of the cafe they clearly had a larger than usual number of kitchen staff on hand. They have homemade syrups for their soda and they had $2 for unlimited bottled still or sparkling water, I wish every restaurant in Toronto would do this.   I ordered the lavender soda, the sticky pork and my friend and I shared an order of fries and she had the St Lawrence salad.   The lavender soda was a bit sweet for my liking but we also ordered sparkling so I just added more water.  The fries were well done, thick cut fries, well fried, not greasy, golden, delicious! It came with a dollop of mayo and we also asked for chili sauce and they brought a delicious homemade chili sauce made of puréed peppers, chili, and ginger.   Now before you read further, remember i gave this place 4 stars but if i'm reviewing fairly I'd say the sticky pork was slightly disappointing. Don't get me wrong, it was great, but it's probably the only reason this is 4 stars instead of 5.   The sticky pork was a piece of pork belly and pork shoulder. The pork shoulder was done to perfection, yum! But the pork belly lacked the soft texture of really good pork belly. It was a bit too firm... It could be personal preference but the fat was a bit too chewy and the sauce was good but lacked a bit of depth. It was more sweet than anything else.   Overall the food was still fantastic and I'd love to go back and try the chicken that the table next to us had. I'd probably even order the pork again, 4 stars is still very delicious in my books!"}
{"text":"Nice surprise within brickworks.  Nice variety of items, staff was attentive.  Nice signage and presentation.  I started 3 sentence with NICE."}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat, there food is always fresh and made with the best organic ingredients, it's worth the price and the atmosphere is great, good location as well, not too hard to find or get to. The service is great as well, always nice and everyone always has a smile on their face. You can't go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"I made reservations here for a Mother's Day Sunday brunch this year since my mom had wanted to try the place since it opened but its location was kind of out of the way from the city core.   We ordered a soup of the day, st lawrence salad, eggs be, and a side order of their buttermilk biscuit. The quality of the food was not bad: the salad was fresh, the soup came out hot and of the right texture, the eggs benny were done just right, and their buttermilk biscuit came out warm and fluffy albeit a bit moist for my mother's tastes. The brunch was delicious and the portions were generous enough to be shared by two ladies, but nothing that couldn't be had elsewhere with a less expensive price tag.   In terms of service, it was Mother's Day and the place was busy. The food took a while to come out but the staff were nice and pleasant throughout. Each mother also went out with a handmade soap as a gift that day too. Overall, it was a good experience.  The one thing to complain about was what happened to our bill after the meal was over. When the visa bill came at the end of the month there was a discrepancy to what the visa center charged me and the actual amount charged on the receipt. I wasn't as concerned with the small over charged amount as I was with what went wrong with the billing procedure since this has never occurred to me before. After calling the visa center, they told me to redirect my call back to cafe belong's manager. The manager told me it was an error on their part and that they would deal with the issue from their end with the visa center. Meanwhile, I have been left waiting since that time with no changes made or to be seen on my credit card. I appreciated that they took my call, but there is no point in me calling if no action was taken and the issue unresolved. Yes, the amount over charged may not be significant, but as a customer, I no longer want to come back since I don't know if my credit card would be over charged again by the staff."}
{"text":"In my photo caption I said the Dark Chocolate Brownie is quite possibly the best I've had in Toronto. On second thought and taste, I can't remember ever tasting a better brownie in the city, so I'm willing to say they are the best Brownie I've ever had in Toronto, and possibly in my life!!!  I also ordered the Turkey and Bacon Stew, which was great! A very thick soup without being gluey, full of turkey chunks that were juicy, a great smokey bacon flavour, and perfectly seasoned.  Too bad I wasn't hungry enough for a full meal, I am sure it would be equally as good. I am planning to visit another day for the full experience."}
{"text":"I am extremely picky, and this place hit on all cylinders. Our waiter, Stefan, was extremely friendly and knowledgable.   The trout was fantastic and light. The scrambled eggs were masterfully cooked and my chorizo hash was the best chorizo I have had.  We were treated with super fresh asparagus and hollandaise sauce that was perfectly balanced.    Their attention to their ingredients show up in their food. Their kitchen is small for their seating, but Stefan acknowledged the time, as they got backed up and it gave us a needed pause we deserve in our Sunday anyway.   When the food hits the palate, you will understand why this brunch deserves the rating I hold for a select few. I can't wait to come back to TO and have brunch here.   Thanks Belong for making our Sunday special.   Oh and Stefan treated us to a blueberry scone. Epic and use your sugar allotment for it, please I beg you."}
{"text":"We came here on a recommendation from a local friend. This was quite the experience and would highly recommend it for a relaxed brunch / date.  Why it's amazing?  1. It's located in an industrial complex of sorts beside an old brick making factory (so, go check out the history when you're done eating ok?)  2. Super friendly service - i wanted a spiced caffeinated tea and she told me that their chai was a bit boring. Instead, she found me a spiced rooibus and gave me a side of cinnamon ( yes, wow)  3. We split the pancakes and the 5 point burrito which was more than enough food.  It was a great combination of sweet and savoury - the pancakes were very light and not too sweet. The peach compote on the side really worked as well !  Wow.  4.  These folks basically make everything on site and are certified ocean -wise with their seafood. Gotta love local   5.  They make their own syrups and you can get \"soda pop\" made with any if these syrups where they bubble in CO2, alternatively make an Italian soda.  Side note : they have a family style type dinner experience ( prix fixe) which I would definitely come back for.  Side note #2 : there is an amazing store across from the cafe which is worth a look ( see artisan soaps, incense, cooking supplies , spices etc)  Go, soon!"}
{"text":"The food is good but WAY overpriced. They do a good job on the presentation but the wait staff are a bit pretentious. The restaurant is clearly taking advantage of being the only sit-down place at the Brick Works and marking-up their food accordingly.  I love the Brick Works, but next time, I'll pack a lunch."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for awhile, and finally did today. Very disappointed. Paid $12 for a literal dry tea biscuit with an egg inside... and a juice. They make you pay another $2 just for a sliver of cheese melted on the egg. The whole thing was tasteless and dry. Also took 15 mins to get this crappy sandwich to go! Wouldn't recommend. I had much higher hopes for this place."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Tough review. We were four during a long weekend in Toronto and did a Friday night dinner at Belong. The location is quite a ways from downtown and bit hard to find in the darker Winter nights. A wonderfully designed restaurant with an intriguing menu that ends up just a bit short all around and at the finish. We did three starters (the grilled radicchio, the daily version of the St. Lawrence salad, and the northern mushrooms). The mushrooms were easily the standout dish to open with the other two fighting to stay in the memory. For mains we did the steak, the grilled roots (sunchoke and celeriac), glazed pheasant, and the fettuccine. The steak was well cooked and solid, the pheasant pleasant, the sunchokes were nice but the celeriac a bit undercooked/roasted, and the fettuccine good enough. Three desserts were a good: orange panna cotta, middling beignets, and the hot chocolate profiteroles - which were way over spiced (it's not \"hot\" chocolate, it's spicy chocolate). One wine, one mocktail, one cocktail, three coffees. Total is about USD$50 per person before tip. That's a great price point, and that gets some star love, but there were only three standout dishes. Staff is good - a bit too chatty, quite honestly, and that's hard to say because the nice-ness is there.  We wonder if we'd go back and we probably wouldn't in a city with some many options."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! Have never seen such rude staff anywhere else! They hate their jobs I guess! This happens when you are the only cafe at EBW farmers market with no other competitor!"}
{"text":"Don't be mislead by the other Yelp reviews for this spot.  You have to come here for dinner.  And get the chef's menu.     Then let it all unfold."}
{"text":"Lots of great options for omnivores and a lovely wine list, I won't rate this place based only on their lack of veg options. Not good for VEGANS, even though this place preaches sustainability, meaning they should have at least 1 vegan option :). We ordered wine on empty stomachs and waited forever to get our bill."}
{"text":"Omg their eggs benedict with avocado and side of potatoes were delicious. Very spacious place with well done food. Would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Food was great, service not so much.  We ordered the smoked trout salad and pulled pork with fried egg. We also ordered a glass of cider - the bill came to $63 before gratuity.   The trout was flavorful and moist, the pork was really tender.  Our server however did not come back even once, until we waved her down for more water towards the end of the meal, nor was she particularly friendly. We will not go our of our way to visit again."}
{"text":"The food we had was quite good. I had the smoked trout, served on some sort of fluffy, whipped cream cheese and rye bread. The portion looked small but was actually filling. The side salad was very fresh - the dressing just right and the roasted heirloom tomatoes were the best part. My friend had the lemon ricotta pancakes, which is a nice change from typical flavours for pancake.  We were a bit surprised that there was an extra $4 charge for maple syrup (the pancake was $15) - feels like being charged extra for ketchup with an order of fries. She didn't end up getting the maple syrup, but I can't imagine eating pancakes without it if it were me. Overall, the menu was pretty expensive - perhaps best for special occasions.  The ambience is excellent - the decor very in tune with the surrounding Evergreen Brick Works. Although when my friend and I went for Saturday morning brunch (in the summer), we were seated in the back and there were 2 fans blowing right at our table - when the waitress was sprinkling ground pepper on my food, a lot of it was blown onto the table. Overall, the service was good - the waitress could have been a bit more knowledgeable about the menu."}
{"text":"I had a late Friday afternoon lunch here and I'm already wondering how soon I can make it back again on a quiet weekday. The overall theme seems to be local gourmet without the fuss. Strawberry lemonade actually made with real fruit: sensational!   I split a burger, chips, and the St. Lawrence salad and I was completely satisfied for hours. The salad may be the best I've ever had; who knew browned-butter vinaigrette could make such a difference. The burger was a tiny bit burned at the edges. Perhaps the recent cronut burger food poisoning incident has inspired longer cook times throughout the city? Portion sizes are very generous so the prices seem reasonable.  Skip the weekend crowds for an improved dining experience - I hope this place sticks around!"}
{"text":"I went the past weekend. Everything started great. There was no space and they took down my number and my girlfriend and I went to walk around and take pics about 15 minutes later they called and said there is spot ready for us. We went back and got our table. The waitress came over and asked if we wanted anything to drink. We said water is fine for now thanks and she didn't hear clearly. First time fine. Then later she came back to take our order and I asked her what non alcoholic drinks there are she went through the juices and soft drinks and said they can make any coffee we like. My girlfriend asked if there is mocha on the menu and it took the waitress about two tries to get what we are asking. Maybe the place is too busy or loud. Maybe they should tone down the music in the background. We ordered our food and the food was average nothing too special and nothing to complain about. But the service was horrible. My girlfriend was just taking a break from her food while I had just finished and the waitress came over to clear my plate and she asked if my girlfriend is done I said I am but she's not and she went to grab her plate too and I had to stop her. Like really?!!! Furthermore, when she asked if we needed anything else I said no we are good for now. And she went away brings me the bill, are you kidding me we were not even half way at our coffees yet. My girlfriend was upset at the service at this time and we just ignored the bill and finished our drinks. I finished my coffee and went to the restroom while my girlfriend was still not done hers, when I returned my girlfriend asked me what time do they close i said not for a while and I checked they open till evening and there are still food coming out and being ordered so I asked why, she said the waitress brought over the card machine and asked if she should wait for me. Like at this point I was pretty floored and did not even want to leave a tip. When we were ready to go and wanted to pay the waitress couldn't be found for a while. Regardless I still left her something small since she's desperate to get us out of there when she went to give me my copy of the receipt she literally dropped it in my hand not handed to me and did not say a word. You should be lucky for getting two stars here for the food being okay. And the waitress was lucky she got any tips at all. Not sure whats with this waitress and her attitude and attention to customers, but the difference between the waiter I had last time and also the guys at reception,  night and day! Very disappointing experience and will likely not return."}
{"text":"Cafe Belong is cute, but kind of pricey. I got a delicious latte here. They have 2 tables for those just taking food to go and they've got a beautiful restaurant with a gorgeous patio for those who choose to eat in.  Their salads look AMAZING. They're ~ $17. Their pastries are about $5. That being said, they're not that big.  They have a bunch of flavours of pop that you can mix together which is super cool.  Lavender, hibiscus, etc. They don't have kombucha though! They have scones and tea lattes and some other sweet and savoury nibblies.  A really cute place for a date. I think they have Muskoka Brewery beers here too!"}
{"text":"I'm going to rate this experience solely on service.  I was with my wife and daughter and decided to stop in for some refreshments on a hot summer day.  Upon arriving here the first thing I noticed was how angry all of the staff looked.  No one was helpful at all, and trying to get some help was near impossible.   We decided to simply order two iced teas to go.  The gentlemen that served us was obviously tired and in a bad mood (maybe because it was near the end of the day and he just wanted to go home), but trying to get him to help us was near impossible   we finally got our two iced teas, which tasted like lightly flavored warm water and left - never to return again.  Management here needs a serious overhaul as the staff obviously don't care, which is a serious problem when it affects all staff members.    Best of luck..."}
{"text":"Had a nice time here when I was starving,and literally stumbled upon it.Staff was polite,and the one out of 3  specials of the day I went with wasn't what I'd expect from such an unassuming place.The grounds are worth a walk, the place is also pet friendly,outside the cafe. Bonus, their serving packaging for take out's all eco friendly."}
{"text":"Food was terrible. We had a lentil soup of the day which was disgustingly over salted. We could barely finish it. An americano at this place is just a watered down coffee. Probably the worst brunch I've had in a while. And for the cost, wow. I don't know how you can screw up such basics. I also don't understand how a place that preaches sustainability doesn't have any vegan brunch options. Get some tofu on your menu, and fire the chef."}
{"text":"I have never written a review for one single item, but here goes! The blueberry scone is quite possibly (wait for it, wait for it) the most amazing pastry I have ever sunken my teeth into. And I hate scones. They're usually so dry, so tasteless, so carb-y, but not this little number. The two times I devoured these bad boys, the deliciousness was served fresh from the oven, still warm! The things are packed with blueberries, so much so that the dough-y nature of the pastry doesn't hold together and crumbles as you break off bits to eat. Not an issue for me though, or the other great friends (Eric T & Jas) who turned me on to these suckers. I do love baking, but I don't know enough to say these are so incredible because the flour to egg ratio, or the cooking time must be different. I can tell you though that I haven't had a scone quite like this one, it's pretty unique in my opinion. They have another flavor, a maple I believe... not the same. Get the blueberry and devour that bad boy. Some day I'll go back and have a real meal, but I know nothing will compare to this little gem of a morning eat."}
{"text":"Very good food and great service. It's a rustic feel at a higher price end, with higher price end serving portions. You should leave feeling satisfied and not overly stuffed"}
{"text":"I was at Evergreen Brick Works for a Craft Beer event and spotted this Cafe packed with people over a weekend. Hence, I went to the full quick-service take-away counter and grabbed a bite size burger, soup and coffee to go. It was absolutely delicious and tasty! There is much more to offer in their restaurant but if you're on a time crunch, the grab and go take-away counter offering refreshments and nourishment is not disappointing  for your visits to the Evergreen Brick Works either for work or for play."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with my girlfriend - the weather was nice so we enjoyed the patio. Surprisingly this place takes reservations for Brunch!  Pulled Pork Shoulder ($27) I really liked the presentation of my dish. Pulled pork meat served on a crispy fried tostada, topped with some black bean aioli, chili, and a fried egg. There was also mashed avocado spread but it was on the side or under the tostada. Although when served it looked slightly small, there was actually a lot of pulled pork meat inside. The pulled pork meat was slightly more tough than I expected but still good, I liked how it's not drenched in sauce but still flavorful. The tostada was nice and crispy which I liked, and went well with the avocado mash. Really tasty.  Eggs BE - Smashed Avocado ($22) Eggs benny on a buttermilk biscuit with a layer of caramelized onions and avocado spread in between, topped with hollandaise. A simple dish, but was really tasty. The egg was made just right and the yolk was runny. The biscuit was a little hard at the bottom but overall went well with the avocado and onions.   I also ordered a mango orange juice which was really good! ($3) I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the place and the food was good. This place seems to be more on the expensive end for brunch, dishes were all $20+ If you don't mind the price, it's a nice secret place for brunch."}
{"text":"It's a nice place to have a beer, but I would not eat there again. I ordered the apricot salad and it felt like an entree. There were literally 4 tiny pieces of halloumi, 2cm by 3 cm for an 18$ salad... yep, I left lunch hungry and I still had several kilometres of trail to walk! There were also one apricot, peas and the arugula... it wasn't good; edible but not enjoyable.   The atmosphere is nice. Stop there for a beer, no more."}
{"text":"3.5 star  I just love the set up at Cafe Belong.   The decoration makes me feel like I am in cottage country somewhere, not in the middle of Toronto right next to DVP. Just love those huge windows letting the sunlight shining in on this warm winter afternoon.  Eating here at Cafe Belong should makes me feel good and healthy as all the ingredients here are local, organic and sustainable.   We shared:  Croque Ravine ($23) - I just love everything even the fried mixed green on the side - Pork was tender! love the caramelized onion  French Toast ($16) - Am I going to eat that? 3 huge piece of banana bread a little crispy outside but still soft inside.. - I found this a little bit too doughy for my liking  - The syrup just add a little sweetness to the already sweet bread  The service though was definitely lacking! My coffee was served in a smallish cup so I ended up have to keep waving down my waitress for a refill while she was just busy chit chatting with the staff at the back. -0.5 star  I definitely will come back to have a bite at Cafe Belong next time when I am visiting Evergreen Brickwork. But it is not worth a special trip."}
{"text":"An update to call out several items on the Cafe Belong menu specifically:  THE FRUIT AND NUT SALAD IS BONKERS.  Bonkers.  Based on what's fresh and available, yesterday's version featured toasted almonds, plums, peaches, beautiful greens and a brown butter vinaigrette.    Cafe Belong has a \"brunch master\" (official title) on staff, so you know they do midday weekend eats right.  Downed with some house-made fizzy water and a blueberry vodka cocktail...it was a perfect summer meal.  Yelp note: the staff here is great, and they've really hit their stride on the service front.  I showed up with a dog, and they helped find him a shaded place on the patio, and moved my table so that I'd be sitting close to him.  Double shout-outs for the Evergreen Brickworks volunteer who supplied him with a bowl of water.  Happy dog = happy me.  I'll be a regular bruncher here, trust."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Evergreen Brick Works and have attended a lot of events there but it was only a few weeks ago that finally try Cafe Belong that's located there. One of those places that I pass by millions times and love the decor and never got the chance to try until now.  It's really pretty at night when you look into the restaurant though their huge window all along the s with the bare wood beam/brick counter/bar/kitchen. It was empty inside that day since everyone opted for the patio (^_^)   We actually went to The Brewer's Backyard (@brewmarket) taking place at the Brick Works that day, so we actually had a beer (or two) before that, so I opted for a glass of white (Norman Hardie Melon Bourgogne - PEC $8 glass. A very light, crisp white wine) instead but Ben wanted another another beer (King Pilsner $5)   Bricklayers Board $20 ~ with House Cured Meats, terrine, cheese Pickle, Mustard & Toast ~Everything was delicious here and perfect to munch on while lounging on the patio with a cold drink :) ~I would have prefer some bread instead of this cracker/flatbread crisp since it was way too salty and flavourful tog with the pate, cheese etc (overpowering) but it's delish to much on it's own    Veggie Flatbread $18 ~It's so pretty but I find it a bit dry, the peas was fresh but prob dried up just laying on top while it the oven :(   French Toast $15 ~Just delicious, this remind me of the Hong-Kong style french toast with very crispy/fried exterior. The difference, it's drenched in syrup so no need to pour any over it but I was very surprise that it wasn't extremely sweet (even for me who can't handle sweet things).  Verdict : Love our Brunch here and I'll definitely come back especially because of the patio Service was great and friendly"}
