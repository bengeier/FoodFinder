{"text":"Really good, fresh food. The indoor and outdoor seating are both really nice. The place has a really good vibe along with good, quick service. Definitely try this place if your looking to eat healthy or just plain tasty. Try the original Acai bowl."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty food and juices in a great neighborhood.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Great juice. A little pricey, but all juice places are. One of the workers had a great recommendation for me and said if I didn't like it, I could get something different.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was hungry after church today and yelped a \"healthy\" lunch spot, and here I was!   What I tried: -Santa Maria Sandwich: Simple & fresh Turkey sandwich. The mango jam inside gave it a nice kick. It also came with a small quinoa-type dish called Tabbouleh which was really yummy too.  -Zinger Juice: Quite the zing! i love spicy foods, but i wasn't expecting this juice to be so spicy. But sip after sip, I enjoyed it more. Energy boost for sure!  I decided to eat-in and do some leisure reading. While doing so, I noticed that all the customers were regulars. They were all on first-name basis with the workers. And once a yoga class was done, seeing all the post-workout Yogi's trickle in with rejuvenated smiles, I couldn't help but notice the friendly vibe all around. Since the cafe is directly connected to the yoga/spin studio in the Improvement Club, this must be super convenient for a post-workout meal. I'll be back to try one of the classes.. as an excuse to try a new Juice/Smoothie :D"}
{"text":"Kicking a bad fast food habit of mine and have finally started to experiment with all this stupid juicing stuff I have heard so much about lately.  Yelp led me to this cafe and wow!  I am impressed.  Fresh, light and DELICIOUSNESS.  I came here for juice but they have so many other healthy options I'll be back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"I recently started coming here to pick up lunch and bring back to the office. I love their juices and their tuna salad is amazing.  It's a little pricey, but well worth it. Can't wait to try more things. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The whole wheat tortillas are soft, delicious, and pleasing. Absolutely the best veggie burrito I've ever had and the salsa was about perfect. It was fun to see an employee snipping herbs from their garden. Don't pass over this spot!"}
{"text":"This place was certainly a great find!  The menu was amazing.  Shockingly none of us tried a smoothie, but they all looked good.  My girlfriend and I had omelets (they call them omelet style burritos because the fillings are wrapped in the egg).  They were so good!  Fresh eggs, fresh meat, fresh veggies, decadent goat cheese.  I wish they had one of them here in Dallas!    It attracts a fitness oriented crowd and I could see singles really enjoying the environment for a plethora of reasons."}
{"text":"I like the concept of seed cafe but after visiting three times I'm still left underwhelmed. I go because it's healthy but that's about it. Every time I've ordered a different bowl but I haven't enjoyed a single one of them. On top of that the value is just not there. I type this as I'm eating a bowl from Neckter (in OC) that cost less and is at least 50% bigger (I won't be able to finish it). It's also much tastier. If you do decide to eat at seed cafe, I recommend skipping the bowls and ordering a sandwich instead."}
{"text":"First time in PHX, fresh off a flight.  Yelped s.e.e.d. and grabbed a fresh juice and 2 energy bars.  Really friendly people, ccol place too. I would def hang out here, do yoga and spin, and eat and what not if I lived here..."}
{"text":"Not knowing the area very well and missing my juice bar back in OC, I decided to give this this place another go. This time I ordered an apple based juice over ice with mint, lime, ginger and spinach. It was as lovely as it could possible be. I was talked into getting a cheeky spaghetti squash dish and was quite pleased with that as well. Also, never forget the homemade bars sold up front; you can never go wrong with these delightful bites."}
{"text":"WOW WOW WOW!!!! I am absolutely addicted to this spot!!! The Turkado Chavokey is my favorite in the morning!! If you haven't been here, GO NOW"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  The food is always fresh and their lemonade is the best I have EVER had :-)  One of the few places where you can eat healthy and the food is very tasty.  Go there almost every day."}
{"text":"SEED Cafe has been replaced with Kaleidoscope Juice. Some of the same menus items are still available. They seem to be a lot busier than the old Cafe. I love the new coffee they brought on scene. However a bit disappointed that my smoothie order has been lost twice in the shuffle."}
{"text":"The new menu only has salads (that have been packaged) and drinks! They used to have a hot food menu of plainly cooked meal options--like Meat The Flinstones, meat and veggies--that I used to eat frequently."}
{"text":"Umm... ok so I couldn't find the door to this place when I first pulled up (blonde moment, I know), but who can blame me when I walk up expecting a juice/smoothie shop and I see clothes inside? Come to find out, they also have yoga and spin classes here and sell some yogi stuff as well.  Anywho, I finally found the door and walked in wanting a nutrient-packed juice or smoothie. The guys at the juice bar kinda walked me through their menu a bit, explaining a few items. I was so intrigued by the ingredients of their smoothies, that I opted for \"The Clark Kent\" and could hardly wait to try it -- until I started looking at the menu some more and realized they had seasonal \"guest appearances\" on the menu. Doh!!! I asked the guy behind the counter if he had started to make my drink yet, to which I THOUGHT he said yes... and asked why? I told him I just realized they had \"The Gingerbread Man\" on the menu and would've liked that one instead, but told him that it was alright, and would come back another time to try it (hoping they would still have it by then).   But then to my surprise when I took that \"love at first sip\" sip out of my smoothie... Lo and behold, it was \"The Gingerbread Man\"!!! I don't know how the guy managed the ol' switcheroo but I'm glad he did! This smoothie literally tastes like you're eating gingerbread cookies, but it's GOOD FOR YOU!!! If THAT'S not amazing, I don't know what is. I'll be back to try one of everything on the menu... it just looks so good."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late lunch snack and picked up some \"power up\" acai smoothie bowls. I relished in the fact that they're incredibly healthy, but the flavor was a bit lackluster compared to other versions I've had at other establishments. The atmosphere was chic and within a yoga studio that has clothes and yoga mats for sale while the food counter is located just past it. A couple of the employees seemed a little ostentatious, but the female who helped up out was very pleasant. I'd revisit for another stab at the menu."}
{"text":"Jamie Lannister might be the kingslayer, but you can go to s.e.e.d. cafe and be a dragonslayer.  The dragonslayer is a smoothie with pitaya (a cactus fruit also known as dragonfruit), strawberries, pineapple, and fresh oj.  It was the perfect sweetness and flavoring mix.  Can't wait to try other goodies.   My friend ordered the scootermonkey and it looked good.  We were both too busy enjoying our smoothies to share.  lol"}
{"text":"Definetly recommend this place! The food is great with lots to choose from. Also offer yoga and spin class!"}
{"text":"Best for a quick bite or an on-the-run pick up.  Got a chance to stop in for a visit as well as did some takeout.    All you need to know are 2 words:  \"Scooter Monkey\"  ... you're welcome!"}
{"text":"I have an affinity for these trendy healthy organic food places and let me tell you. This place did not disappoint. I have always been curious to check out what the Madison Improvement Club is all about, so it was only right that I try the cafe when we stopped by. If you're driving Westbound off Indian School Rd then it is a little tricky to decipher where the parking lot is. I was lead by the large MIC orange arrows into a smaller parking lot next to the club's extension to find that the main parking was on the other side of the wall that separates the 2 buildings. There is a break/path on the back wall to walk through so you don't have to go around towards the street. The cafe itself is small and chic. Only a few tables inside and some more comfy outside shaded seating on the patio. We came in on a downtime so was quick to order and we went with the Chikorizo (?) burrito and the Santa Maria turkey sandwich that came with a side, I chose the quinoa dish. They came out in no time. Both were incredibly delicious with tons of flavor. I LOVED the mango jam in the sandwich, who would have thought? So fresh. I love when healthy tastes so good. I also ordered their regular acai bowl that was unlike any other I've had... It had yogurt in it! Yogurt! It was one awesome healthy dessert that I highly recommend if you have a strong sweet tooth like me. I noticed that they had a plethora of ready-made salads available for quick pick up in the cold case, how convenient! I wish I worked nearby. I definitely can't wait to get to one of the club's classes but mostly so I can eat here again :)"}
{"text":"Healthy, simple, & friendly- Isn't that what Arcadia's all about? This place is inside the Madison Improvement Club, which offers yoga and spin classes. For an all-around-good vibe and an excellent, tantalizing, good-for-you-that-doesn't-taste-good-for-you menu please give this place a SPIN."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Phoenix for yummy, healthy and fast bites and juices. Perfect place to stop and grab lunch during the work day.  I frequently get a green juice in the afternoon to overcome the 3:00 hump. The Road Runner is one of my favorite treats- it's a healthy black bean brownie!   Everyone that works here is very nice and friendly- I've only experienced great customer service. Love this place ;))"}
{"text":"Went to S.e.e.d. cafe for the first time today and I was made instantly a fan of the place.  I had their Santa Maria sandwich and Big Yard green smoothie drink.  Both were wonderful and actually the smoothie filled me up enough that I was able to save my sandwich until dinner.  Even hours later it still tasted fantastically amazing.  The place is really easy to find right on the corner with plenty of parking and plenty of seating outside.  On the inside it seems to be a bit cramped but that's okay.  Everything is slightly over priced but I tended to notice that when you're wanting something fresh or healthy for you in general it's more expensive.  The cheaper it gets the more it's filled with chemicals and artificial everything to the point you're not even eating real fruits, veggies, and meats.  So I'm pretty okay with the price.  It's like healthy fast food almost.  I liked the cashier also and the vibe of all the staff. Everyone one was kind and friendly, and there was an atmosphere in the air that felt like everyone knew everyone. Very friendly. It's like Cheers bar on tv, but everything good for you instead of bad.  I'll be going here again and again. Loved it!"}
{"text":"This is my kind of food! Healthy yet flavorful and hearty! This little cafe is located within Madison Improvement Club which means that you can grab a meal, snack or juice before or after a class. But don't be confused and think you can only visit if you are taking a class. You can just simply stop in and get a salad or sandwich to-go, or dine in! They also have a wide range of juices, shakes, and veggie drinks.   I work on the go and this is going to become one of my new favorite places to work from. This is because they have a great outdoor patio that's covered with room to work from. The staff is very friendly and helpful and if you order your food to dine in, they will bring it right to your table. Today I worked from the cafe and enjoyed the delicious Santa Maria which was turkey on toasted wheat bread complete with lettuce, tomato, avocado, brie and the most delicious jalapeno jam! It was huge so I could only eat half and took the rest home to enjoy later. I really liked the sandwich and I look forward to coming back and enjoying the salads and other items off the menu. Speaking of salads, they have them pre-packaged and ready to go so you can literally run in and grab one, buy it and go!"}
{"text":"If you're familiar with the euphemism \"drinking the Kool-Aid\", that's exactly what I'm doing. This place is super contemporary, super clean, and super fit. The menu can be a little bit intimidating, so I recommend taking a look online before you head in. I got the Clark Kent smoothie, and my only regret is I got the small instead of the large. Guys, they put apple cider vinegar in it. It gave it this incredibly delicious tart taste And I love that I don't feel like I'm drinking ice cream or some kind of Jamba Juice concoction. This is the real deal for healthy juicing and smoothies. You do pay the price, but I kind of feel like it's worth it. I also got the Kale Them with Kindness salad to go aaand I'm pretty excited to eat it for dinner.   I really enjoyed the atmosphere, and that goes for the people who work there as well. I'm not exactly in the best shape, but I'm trying, and I didn't feel out of place or judged the way some super health places can come across. Bravo."}
{"text":"I LOVE this cafe. This neighborhood was so in need of a wonderful place like this! I have been here on numerous occasions; with my 19 month old son, with my family or after a yoga class. and EVERY single time, it has been fantastic.   The menu is excellent, I have only had lunch and have really gravitated toward the Your So Keen sandwich (vegan with homemade quinoa patty). amazing. The fresh pressed juices are so good, you will want to come back every day.  The staff really makes the place. They are so kind and friendly, and really helpful picking out selections or just saying hello. And as an upcoming cafe, they are super receptive to feedback, I asked if they have a highchair, and the staff looked at each other and said, oh, hadn't thought of that. I haven't double checked to see if they got one, but loved the fact they were so receptive.  They also carry vegan cupcakes/cookies baked inhouse. To be honest, I haven't tried these because the cupcakes don't look super appealing, but I'm sure I will. The cookies look really good though!   If you have not been here, you should definitely go. the food is great, staff is amazing and they have lots of vegan options and healthy juice.   thank you for bringing life back to this little corner!!"}
{"text":"What a great little gem in the Arcadia neighborhood!  S.e.e.d is located inside Madison Improvement Club and it's a great place to a quick healthy meal, juice or smoothie.  The menu is eclectic and somewhat extensive for a health food cafe with a ton of vegetarian and vegan options.  I prefer their brunch items which include acai bowls, breakfast burritos, and oatmeal.  The lunch menu is also great with some interesting salads and very unique sandwiches.  I would say that their best specialty is green juices and vegan desserts if that's your kind of thing.  Either way, check it out for brunch or a healthy lunch, you won't be disappointed.  It can get pricey since it's healthy food but nothing you wouldn't expect for this kind of place."}
{"text":"This is a really nice place very earthy yet modern the food was really great I do think it the price was a little higher than normal but you get what you pay for and this is really great food. of course there is also a gym as well which is kind of interesting it's a cardio aerobics type of gym inside the same building.  the eating area is very small but nice.  a lot of tables.  but with all that being said I would still recommend this place it's great."}
{"text":"o.b.s.e.s.s.e.d.  Yes, that's right... s.e.e.d. is my new obsession... I cannot get enough of their fresh squeezed juices, healthy snacks, salads and sandwiches.  I've lost count of the number of times I've visited, but it's definitely more than I can count on my fingers and toes, and I've always walked away a happy customer.    Over the weekend, I had a big birthday celebration and invited some friends to celebrate with me at the Madison Improvement Club.  We did a #partyonabike (spin) class with Brittny, a private flow yoga class with Beri, and had lunch catered by s.e.e.d right on the patio.  It was perfect in every way!  I worked with Carly to plan it and she was OMazing... we ended up with the following menu for my group:  *1 hummus platter *1 skinny dipping platter  *1 Jaqlyn Salad  *1 Kale 'em with Kindness Salad *1 Santa Maria Platter (wrap style) *1 Tune Up Platter (wrap style) *1 What She's Having Platter (wrap style)  We also had juice shots (The Walk, Conquer the World, Zinger).    Every single person I spoke to raved about the food, and I loved it so much, I ate leftovers for dinner... on my birthday!  If I could give Carly, Jaqlyn, and Chef Joe more than 5 stars, I would... Thank you for making me the most perfect birthday lunch, and you can bet you'll see me back at s.e.e.d. again real soon!"}
{"text":"They have some of the best juice in town. $10 for a 24oz is a little pricey for me but I always go back. I've never had the food so 5 stars for the juice!"}
{"text":"Great food and nice seating outside. It's connected to a spin class room. Good for healthy items."}
{"text":"The smoothies here are outta this world! We came here three times while in town! The blue giraffe,date with a celb and three month vacay. were the top favorites."}
{"text":"This my new spot!  I love going around the city check on which cafe will be my next favorite.  First off fresh juice! I love it.  I usually have to go get juice somewhere first and go somewhere else for food.  But here the juice quality matches the food quality.  I had a chicken chorizo egg burrito.  In a tortilla that had been crisped on the flat top and all ingredients tasted so fresh I savored every bite.  And service was fast and friendly. What every question I had the service personnel had a quick answer and gave it with a smile.  The cafe shares it's place with a spin bike and yoga studio.  There is a lot of history in a very modern renovated building.  They even gave us a tour of the facility.   Everything was clean. The place smelt great! And the atmosphere is chill!  I am going to come back many more times. I am excited I finally made my way over there. You should too."}
{"text":"Everything you can ask for and more!  Amazing food, vast fresh pressed juice selection, and the most friendly staff in town.  Seed cafe not only delivers high quality healthy food quickly, but they do it while creating a friendly family-like culture."}
{"text":"Congratulations!  You had the absolute best vegan sandwich in town and then you went and ruined it by changing the type of vegan cheese you use.   Why? Because your chef thinks it's better?  Last time I checked the chef wasn't the one supporting your business, and he's probably not vegan anyway.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it!  I have nothing against Daiya , but it does not work on \"You're so keen\" AT ALL.   In fact, \"You're so mean\" for not listening to your customers requests.  Please go back to using Follow Your Heart. So I can go back to following mine and continue dining with you."}
{"text":"The last couple of times I've been here there were lots of 20 somethings pumped on endorphins and talking in really loud, high pitched voices. \"Oh my God...no way!\" But there are some fresh and creative vegan food options and they have enough staff that you shouldn't be waiting for your food for too long. In the fall they have an awesome vegan pumpkin pie smoothie."}
{"text":"I fell in love with the seed cafe as soon as I parked. The parking lot may be small but as far as parking lots go it's pretty gorgeous. I had the bigger yard smoothie which featured spinach, kale, mango and coconut water. The guys were nice enough to omit the pineapple from my smoothie as oftentimes it's much to acidic for my tummy to handle. My smoothie came out an impressive green color and I loved the texture. Everything about it was perfect."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Phoenix, I came to s.e.e.d. for breakfast, based on the Yelp reviews alone, excited to get something healthy to start my day. My vacation food choices get progressively less healthy as the day goes on, so I like to start off on a good note.   The cafe area is really nice - modern, industrial feel, with high gloss tables and chairs, orange accents to the metal and fresh green plants on each table. Paired next to a spin and yoga studio, but with its own entrance on one side.   The menu has more categories than I expected (juices, smoothies, bowls, oatmeal, burritos, light lunch), but not a ton of options in each category (maybe 2-5 per).   The employee taking our order was very nice, answered some questions. My party ordered an original acai bowl, a couple smoothies (dragon slayer & 3 month paid vacation), and a breakfast burrito (all in one).   Everything tasted very fresh, quality ingredients, and very tasty! I loved both smoothies and the burrito, although a little on the small side, was very good. The acai bowl had a layer of organic yogurt on the bottom, which I've never seen before, but I liked the creaminess it added.   Only hang ups are that it is a little on the pricy side compared to other juice and smoothie bars (and I'm even used to paying CA prices!), service time to make our items was a little slow. Also I asked and was told the acai bowl was served with blueberries, strawberries, and bananas, and asked for no blueberries. When I got the bowl it had tons of blue berries and no bananas, which was a bummer.   Bottom line, if you are in the area and want a healthy and delicious drink, come on in and you'll leave happy!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy stopping by SEED on my way to work and getting a smoothie. As nutritious as they are, they don't taste bland or gross. Going here for a quick drink makes me feel like I'm starting the day off right. Someday I'm hoping to try some of the burritos on the menu. Or maybe go to the spin classes in the building associated with them. This is definitely worth stopping by and checking out if you want something quick and healthy!"}
{"text":"Got the organica drink. It tastes better than it looks. I thought it would taste better if they could add more pineapple in my drink."}
{"text":"3 stars for atmosphere.  I've only been here once, but in that one experience, I felt like a bit of an outcast since I was just a normal customer and not also part of the Yoga club.  I hadn't realised the cafe was inside a Yoga place.  The being said, next time I'll just order everything to go since this place makes some of the best smoothies I've ever had.  And I'm not even a smoothie fan.  Will be back for the food."}
{"text":"Located inside of Madison Improvement club. Its almost a shame they arent freestanding to get more business. I love the health concious menu and it is deliecous."}
{"text":"Just thinking about the \"You're So Keen\" makes me salivate.  Its so nice to have more vegan/vegetarian options in Phoenix and especially being well-priced and tasty.  I've only tried one other dish \"What She's Having\" which was also quite good and enough to comfortably satiate 2 people if they have relatively normal appetites.  Only downsides about this cafe is that they don't take take-out food orders after 3 PM on most days (they do sell whatever is in their counter area) and parking can be limited if there's a yoga/spinning class in session."}
{"text":"Great smoothies (the dragonfruit one is amazing), but the atmosphere is definitely a little weird. If you're not there for fitness (which, I didn't even realize was an option until I showed up), you'll feel kind of like an outcast. They clearly have a community following for yogis and maybe spin-class junkies, but it feels a little pretentious. I'm sure they fist-pump unironically. It looks like a fun place to work, because the people behind the counter are always joking around with each other. That being said, it also seems a little too exclusive (with the customer being the excluded party). I'll be back for the smoothie, but I probably won't stay."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to have lunch at s.e.e.d after a ridiculously hard hot yoga class next door, and it definitely set me on the right path for my day. My experience there was a total health overload in the best way possible. This place has tons of natural light, a good amount of seating, and so many options for lunch. Salad, sandwiches, juices... take your pick!  As far as the juice goes, the \"zinger\" is so good. Lemon, romaine, spinach, apple and ginger? Yum! The \"naked in public\" looked so great too and would be perfect for breakfast. That one's loaded with bananas, blueberries, vanilla protein, and almond milk. If all else fails, you can just make your own and add whatever you'd like.  For lunch, I ordered the Santa Maria sandwich and I would order it 100 times again. It comes with roasted turkey breast, mango jalapeño jam, avocado, brie, and arugula. My co-workers both had salads which they enjoyed very much as well.   I just glanced at the breakfast menu online and it looks just as impressive as lunch. Oh how I wish I had this place down the street from me! I can't say enough great things about s.e.e.d. Do your body a favor and go get your health fix!"}
{"text":"Amazing cafe inside the Madison improvement club! Only open the hours the work out facility is open but the to go salads are amazing. Highly recommend the kale salad. Great gluten free, vegan, vegetarian and paleo options."}
{"text":"I love this place. Hip healthy spot with friendly service. Shakes and smoothies are awesome and mostly what I have gotten but today I ate a protein bowl with chicken. Delicious. Yoga and spin classes, pay by the day or monthly. First time discounted price and for beginners yoga fundamentals on Sundays at 11."}
{"text":"Spot on.  They have found a great balance between having healthy food but good tasting food.  I have the impression that the chef knows his customer.  They have continued to expand and grow their menu in a calculated not rushed way.  I think this allows each dish to shine.    I eat there quite often and my other half (who doesn't work out) enjoys the food and always comments \"doesn't taste like health food)  I do wish they would ass their Nut Juice from the juice cleanse onto there menu.    I could see a second location in North Scottsdale doing really well and look forward to my next meal there."}
{"text":"This little fitbetch-hub is Arcadia in all the right ways... give it a shot next time you're overcome with a sense of claustrophobia and dread when someone invites you to LGO for lunch.  These are some of the crucial inquiries one must make when analyzing the iconic veggie burger, including: is it bland, pretending to be meat, as unhealthy as a regular cheeseburger, and/or a uniform ball of mush? s.e.e.d. gives a resounding \"nah\" to all.  Quinoa patties are inherently squishy, but s.e.e.d. uses bread so toasted that you still get the ideal ratio of o.h.y.e.a.h. *action movie announcer voice* Super-toasty 9-grain. Soft, spiced quinoa patty. Avocado. Tomato. Vegan chive mayo. Red pepper tapenade. Melty vegan cheese. Available now.  P.S. - bonus points for stevia & almond milk at the coffee bar."}
{"text":"Shakes are the bomb.com. Tuna tacos in lettuce leaves were fresh, healthy and delicious. Atmosphere is great too, especially the patio.  A little pricey but totally worth it for quality nutrition that makes your mouth happy."}
{"text":"I secretly wish I were a bird quite often, so naturally, s.e.e.d is right up my tree! Not to mention the fact that it's attached to a lovely lovely yoga & spin studio so that you can think about the awesome smoothie, juice or light bite to get you through that workout (hellllllo hot yoga!)  I ordered one of the green juices which was as good as any green juice I've ever had (yes, you can go wrong with these, especially when they make them more like fruit juice with a tiny bit of greens thrown in. Not the case here). Juices come in fairly-priced large and larger sizes and thanks to me indulging in the latter, had barely any room left to attempt eating my lunch, a special quinoa salad that was delicious. All five bites that I could manage. So delicious, I all but cried when I realized I had left it in my colleague's car!  Do check out S.E.E.D ASAP, even if you do n't plan on taking a yoga or spin class beforehand. Great food that does your body a favor!"}
{"text":"My first attempt to come here was on a Friday night, around 7pm. The 1st problem was that I couldn't find it. My iPhone map said I was there, and I knew that I was at 38th St & Indian School, but I couldn't find it. I went into the strip mall that's on the NW corner of 38th & Indian School, thinking that maybe it was hidden in there somewhere. Nope.  So I decided to exit the strip mall onto 38th and lo and behold, I see \"s.e.e.d.\" in bright orange letters...on the SIDE of the building. *side-eye*  The front of the building, which faces the main road, has the name, \"The Madison Improvement Club,\" on it in glowing bright lights. I passed by this, like twice. Silly me; it didn't click that s.e.e.d. was an acronym for The Madison Improvement Club. (sarcasm) In fairness, there is a banner hung on the front wall that mentions burritos and \"s.e.e.d. cafe.\" Mind you, this building is on the NE corner of Indian School & 38th St, so while you're rubber necking to look at that little banner, you're likely to rear-end someone who's either stopping at that light, or turning at that corner in front of you.  So let me tell you what the business's website fails to: s.e.e.d. is located inside of, or shares a space with, The Madison Improvement Club, which I assume, judging by the abundance of yoga mats, yoga pant-cladded clientele, and the highlighted, \"OM\" in the sign, is a yoga studio.   A vegan site had their hours listed as 6am-9pm, M-F. I did not check s.e.e.d.'s website first. Alas, they were closed.  The hours on the door indicate that they're open 6a-7:02pm on Fridays. But again, 7pm, and they were closed. I checked their website and it clearly says their hours are 6am-2pm on Fridays. That's my fault for not double checking.   Anyway, I went back today and ordered the You're So Keen sandwich. I ordered mine without the vegan cheese or tomatoes. The side of the day was Tahini Cauliflower, so I choose that instead of the standard side of tabbouleh. My total was $9.75. The sandwich was ok. It was not bad. It was not memorable. It was just ok.  I tasted 1 speckle of spice in one bite, but that was about it in the flavor department.  A nice guy, who was working there, suggested I try it as a wrap next time; he said it's super good as a wrap.  I'll keep that in mind. That tahini cauliflower dish was very tasty though.  Not bland, and not too overpowering either. The cauliflower was nicely cooked too; it still had its crunch.    It's a small, cozy cafe with a decent amount of vegan items. Vegan options are noted with a \"V,\" whereas, the vegetarian options have \"VEG\" by them.    Everything seems really light and healthy, and the food was very fresh. They have juices, smoothies, and a grab-n-go case that is stocked with salads and some desserts; however, there were no vegan desserts when I went.  Bummer. They have a nice, covered patio area with a cute picnic table, as well as a few bar tables.  They have their own parking lot (which is really cute, by the way), but it was very full; I got the last parking spot in the lot. I assume most of the cars belonged to yoga students, because there were only about 6 people in the cafe, 3 of whom were the staff.   Cute cafe. Ok food vegan, in my opinion. There are other vegan options very close by, so it's doubtful that I'll revisit."}
{"text":"Its nice to have found a place with healthy and creative options! They are always introducing new things and specials to the menu, so you could literally eat here everyday if you wanted to! Juices, smoothies, coffee, breakfast, lunch...they've got it covered.   The Santa Maria is delicious! I ordered a sandwich/wrap platter to bring to a family friend who was in the hospital, and I was getting comments left and right as I walked through the lobby of how delicious everything looked. Definitely a great catering option for any event or office meeting you may need food for!   Super friendly staff, and you can tell they love where they work!"}
{"text":"Great salads and juice, a very warm environment and lovely staff, and I feel that the food is made with love. If I lived here I would be a regular."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, first time I got a juice and second time I got a smoothie. Both were very good. I haven't tried the food yet, but it looks delicious. I like this place but there's just this vibe here- it's kind of like rich people who don't care? I've only been here when it's dead, so maybe they're more lively when it's busy. All I'm saying is, I got more conversation from the TSA agent while she was patting me down. A friendly greeting goes a LONG, long way with me."}
{"text":"Best tuna sandwich I have ever had! Super friendly staff. The tabbouleh is out of hand! So good!"}
{"text":"Ohhhhhh myyyyy GAWD GOOD!!!!!!!! Stopped in to get a healthy snack...grabbed a smoothie aptly named 3 month paid vacation...and holy YUMMMMMM! Super cute location amazing choices and get your yoga and or spin on as well!!! Another GEM to the arcadia neighborhood!!!"}
{"text":"We come every week after yoga for a delicious Yo Adrian (salad) and Free Spirit (juice with green apple, lemon, ginger, and cayenne). Addicted."}
