{"text":"Very nice resort but be careful when booking a room. I am a Starwood lifetime gold member with over 400 plus stays to date. Never have I been charged for a room until I checked out, until staying at this property. I have been charged prior to arrival before but it is made very clear when booking. This resort gave no such warning. Be wary when booking"}
{"text":"This hotel is a great place to spend your afternoons laying out by the pool sipping margaritas! After the poolside expirence you are able to head over to the casino in a boat. The rooms are great and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Attended a conference there and the facility was great. The bed was comfortable, the weight room at the spa had everything you need to get a workout.  Visited the bar at the pool and service was great, and the bartender at the pool was attentive to all the guests.  I also visited the lounge bar in the hotel, service there was great.  We sat at a table and Jessica came by multiple times to make sure we had everything we needed.  Overall a good experience, even though I had to attend I conference, I was able to enjoy the facility, as the conference ended in the early afternoon and my flight out was the next morning."}
{"text":"I travel al over the world and was impressed by the ambience, food and service. I had dinner at the more casual restaurant since Kio was closed mon and tues. I recommend the oatmeal for  breakfast and the nicoise salad with lovely fresh tuna was one of the best I have ever had for lunch. I recommend taking  advantage of the local stables. I  had a private ride with native American, Manny and his horse desperado and learned about wildlife and the local native american tribes. we were very fortunate people to get fairly close to a wild herd of mustangs. I got amazing photos and had great confidence in Manny who has a great respect for nature and these animals."}
{"text":"The best part of staying at this hotel was leaving it. I stayed here 8 interminable nights during a client conference. Each day was greeted by new (and bizarre) service defects. The restaurant opens (but mostly closes) at the convenience of staff. A vacuum never once touched the carpet in my room. Service trays rotted on corridor floors for days. Oh, and if your cell phone breaks and you need to briefly check your voice mail from your room (the property is in the middle of nowhere), they charge you $20 for a 30 second call. (update: to their credit, they did credit me for the calls) I could go on but I have to see my therapist in an effort to recover from my Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Resort. There are lots of great resorts in the Phoenix but this one isn't even in the running and should be avoided at all costs."}
{"text":"I just visited this resort for a conference. I was really impressed with everything about it from the customer service to the delicious food and amazing ambiance. I would highly recommend it for any all all company functions. I'm also hoping to get back here soon for a personal vacation. It's very reasonably priced for the great amenities- pools everywhere I looked, excellent spa, nature trails throughout the property, fire pit, etc."}
{"text":"I just wanted to say out of all the hotels in the valley I chose Sheraton Wild Horse Pass for  me and my wife to stay the night and celebrate on the joyous occasion for New Years Eve.  It was very disturbing saying the very least when the fire alarm went off around 4 a.m. in our wing and immediately we jumped from a dead sleep.  As I proceeded into the hallway people were looking at each other saying is this a false alarm without knowing what to assume.  I personally felt systems should of been in place to where the management staff should of been there conveying whether to get out of the building or it is simply a false alarm.  Think we both can agree moments in a real fire can have serious and disastrous consequences.  After the alarm stopped we were way too alert to even thing about falling back to sleep so needless to say we left after 4:45 this morning.  Personally don't think it was worth the $166.88 when it pertains to personal safety.  Do think out of all the casino hotels in the valley Talking Stick Resort is the best as well as being close to all the ammenities in Scottsdale.

{"text":"I stayed here for a business meeting and I loved every minute of it!  I actually booked an extra two nights so that I could do some sightseeing and relaxing.  The resort is on an Indian Reservation outside of Chandler.  If you are flying into Phoenix, it is about 20-25 minutes from the airport.  For those gambling inclined, there is also a Wild Horse Casino (and hotel) that is down the road.  The hotel was gorgeous, decorated in a southwest motiff.  The gym was large and had updated equipment and machines.  There were several pools and a waterslide (which I tried of course) that overlook the mountains.  Also, I went horseback riding early one morning with a guide, it is offered through the resort, it was decently priced and worth it.  There are a few trails in the surrounding desert with historical points of interest.  While I was there one evening at dusk, a dust storm blew through - it was actually really cool and only lasted a short time.    Scottsdale is a short driving distance away.  There are some nice local shops and eateries in that area to explore.  Would highly recommend this resort."}
{"text":"Be prepared to exercise to get to your room after you check in. I've had the last room at the end of both wings before, and it is a hike. If you are on the north side of the property, consider parking at Aji Spa, which will be the most convenient.  My favorite room is the Executive Suite with the dual, opposing shower heads. I've stayed in all of the other rooms, including the one with the dual fireplaces, but this is, by far, my favorite room on the property. The bed is extremely comfortable, and the climate control in the room works quite well. After all, ultimately, isn't what's important a comfortable room, a comfortable bed, and an awesome shower?  I enjoy sitting and relaxing outside of the Lobby Bar at night. The pool area is large and very nice. You can definitely enjoy some beautiful sunsets from here.  The front desk staff has always been extremely nice to me. I have had one or two occasions where my room was not serviced until late in the day. And every so often, the hallways do exhibit a funky odor.  As a Platinum and soon-to-be Lifetime Platinum SPG member, this property is awesome at making me feel welcome. They recently supplied my room with two bottles of Voss water in addition to the two free bottles they already supply me for being Platinum. They also left me a box of chocolates and a card thanking me for staying at their property, and that goes a long way. Other times, they've given me fresh fruit.  I'm split between liking and not liking the fact that it is far from anything off property save for the Wild Horse Pass Casino, which they have a free shuttle to from the lobby. As a personal quirk, I don't like eating where I stay, and I don't like chains, so I usually end up with a 20-minute drive for dinner. That being said, I also enjoy its remoteness.  They have some great deals if you are a AAA member.  One item of note...I stayed here in early June 2013 and had a room on the 2nd floor and killed two roaches scurrying inside the room in one night. I don't know how many more there were, but if there were two I could see, then I'm scared to know about the ones I didn't. And yes, I never left the doors to the balconies open. I've stayed here a bunch of times and this was the first time I'd encountered roaches so it was a little disconcerting. It freaked out my date. Consider not leaving anything on the floor, including your shoes."}
{"text":"Beautiful property but unfortunately we were here during a haboob that created issues with moisture/humidity in the room. We were told the issue should be resolved in 24 hours but 24 hours later it wasn't so we reported it again. They wanted us to move to another room but the last thing we wanted to do after a long day was pack and upack. We were given a $25 food/beverage credit!  $25 for two days of damp furniture and carpet and for two people. The Sheraton needs to step up their approach to dealing with inconveniences!"}

{"text":"We had our wedding here on Saturday. It was awesome. Sandra the coordinator was amazing and I knew that she would take care of everything. It was beautiful and was better than I imagined! I would highly recommended Wild Horse Pass Resort and Spa for a wedding.  They gave us a bridal ready room which was so nice! We had an awesome staff helping us and the food was to die for!   We got tons of compliments."}
{"text":"To start off, the staff went above and beyond accommodating our requests. Furthermore, the suite we were in was spectacular- wonderful views, spacious, quiet and everything we would hope for for our wedding night. The Sheraton welcomed us as newlyweds with a room service surprise and we could not have asked for more!"}
{"text":"We went in November 2010 and our stay was Completely serene.  The staff is ABSOLUTELY professional and wonderful! They saw us walking through the parking lot with luggage and they swung into action .. zoomed over took our luggage from our hands, and offered us a ride to the lobby! Wow THAT is service! The room was extremely conducive for resting and rejuvenating! We arrived at 10 pm and the room service was delicious and FAST! Very happy about the interesting LOCAL vegetables that were indigenous to the native Americans there. The bathrooms were INCREDIBLY clean and luxurious! They had thought of everything from hairdryers to light up mirrors! A sunken extra wide tub and a gorgeous glass shower that made you feel like yo were in a waterfall!  All night we heard the wonderful stream from the river and all the wildlife!  ~ this is a place for a real get away vacation with amazing trails to walk, ride horses, have spa treatments, and just sit by the pool and hear yourself think!  The little gift shops and restaurant was cozy and DELICIOUS! Everywhere you sit it appears that you are out of doors in the old west BEFORE it was settled! My guy and I were caught up in the charm and romance!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The grounds were nice, the food was good, and the service was hospitable and friendly. However, $13/day for wired Internet in the room, and $20/day to use the fitness center? And even worse, the rooms will never, ever get colder than 68F, even if you set the thermostat to 60F. Yes, I called to complain that my room was warm, even when the thermo was set to it's coldest setting of 60F. They sent a tech who adjusted the vents and then said that they have green-friendly thermostats that are pre-programmed to not let the room get colder than 68F, and that they get frequent complaints, even from staff. What did they do about it? Nothing except to offer to bring me a small fan and offer apologies. If you like a cool room to sleep in, this is not the place.  And the walk to some of the rooms is long, which isn't an issue if you have time on your hands (which I didn't - I was here for a conference). There are much better values around the US, I would skip this place altogether."}
{"text":"I'm sure that most  people have noticed already, but several of the reviews that have been posted here (including some high ratings) are actually for the casino that is about a mile away.  This review is for the Sheraton resort and spa.  I will say up front that my review is from the perspective of a business traveler.  I stay in hotels about 90 nights a year, and have seen just about everything from high end luxury to downright scary.  This review should be seen that way.  If you are on vacation with your family, or only travel occasionally and see this as your annual boondoggle then your perspective may be different.   If you're in my situation, you're better off staying at a traditional hotel.  I was here for only one night to speak at a conference.  Business travelers in that situation (especially those of us who are traveling alone) would actually rather be at home and want this to be as painless as possible.  We value convenience, service, ease of use, the ability to simply relax without a big production, and knowledgeable staff more than spas and golf courses.  This hotel falls short on those criteria.  Actually I do golf quite a bit, but I didn't bring my clubs because they don't take tee times for singles. I was told I could try to walk on but the odds weren't great.  Thpt.   Overall - nice looking place.  But the service just does not lend itself to business travel.  A few examples are below.  I'm leaving out several annoyances that were equally odd.  No one thing is life threatening but after a while they add up to a lousy experience.   First thing was minor but indicative of a clueless staff.  I came straight from the airport on a Saturday, and arrived a little early in the day (around 1:00 pm).  The room was ready which was a pleasant surprise.  About ten minutes after I got to my room I made a phone call.   While I was talking there was a knock on the door.  I was on the phone, not exactly expecting anyone, and there was no identification (like \"housekeeping\") so I ignored it.  Another knock followed quickly by the door opening.  Note to hotel staff - if you are going to do that it's a good idea to identify yourself so you don't freak out the guest.  It was just a guy who was there to stock the mini-bar (shouldn't that be done before one checks in) but enough to surprise me.    Time for dinner.  I'm on the road, a little tired, in the wrong timezone and would like a nice hot meal in the easiest way possible.  I'm thinking find a seat at the restaurant bar, order a steak and read on the ipad.  Simple enough?  No.     They have a restaurant called Kai.  It's high end, has a dress code, and actually bans electronic devices (which is fine but kills reading on the ipad at the bar).  Ok - how about the other one (out of five) restaurant that is open.  No bar, you need to reserve a table, and I could tell by the sneer from the hostess that a single at a table (which I hate doing anyway) was not what she wanted to see on Saturday night.  Fine - there is a bar fifteen feet from the entrance of the restaurant.  I sit down and order a beer.  There is a guy next to me reading the menu of the restaurant.  When he's done, I grab it and try to order something.  \"Sorry - we just have that here so people can look at it - you can't order their food at the bar you can only order the apps on the bar menu\".  Anyone who travels for business as much as I do knows that is BS.  A waiter can't carry the plate twenty feet out the door?  Really?  Does this little six seat cubbyhole bar have it's own kitchen that only makes the appetizers on the bar list?    Fine, I'll go order a pizza.  I could do room service but have no confidence in this place now.  Walking past the concierge stand I think \"maybe I'll get a recommendation\".  No one is there, so as I am looking through the stuff, the concierge walks up and ignores me completely.  Another lady walks up and looks through the same stuff and gets a sweet \"what can I help you find\".  Now I'm getting po'ed.    So after an hour of wandering around and getting shut out at this \"wonderful full service resort\" I finally order a pizza. When it arrives, they call my room and tell me I have to come to the front desk to get it.  What? There is no security or anything like that.  Anyone who doesn't look like a vagrant (and some who do) can walk past the front desk and down the halls.  But put a pizza in his hand and it's a problem?  Luckily I still had pants on, so off I went to finally get something to eat.  Finally off to dreamland.  But the walls are pretty thin.  So when the family in the room next to me start running around and playing the tv at 5:30 am, it's all I can hear.  The place is meant as a resort for vacationers I guess.  But should that mean that single business travelers should be shit on?  To me it comes off as a carnival cruise ship on land.  It's smarmy and the staff doesn't care much because most people won't be back any time soon anyway."}
{"text":"Wonderful hotel. Only here for a couple of days, but we had a fantastic time. Staff is excellent. Every employee was extremely courteous, professional and friendly.  Hotel is immaculate, quiet and comfortable.  Had breakfast and dinner that both were very good. I am a vegan and the chef made me the one of the best meals I have ever had, lots of delicious flavors.  Shout out to our waiter Jose, he could not have been any more attentive and congenial."}
{"text":"Resort is great but restaurants a little pricey but the food was great . Beautiful place with a great pool and a decent view."}
{"text":"We just had our second stay here and after the first stay, I probably would have given this place a 1 or 2 star review, but my wife and I were looking for a weekend getaway and were having trouble finding available rooms at other resorts and we also found an awesome AAA rate for the weekend, so we decided to give them a second chance, and boy are we glad we did!   The first stay started off on the wrong foot where we arrived late at night and our (pre-paid) reservation had been lost. They did find it, but it took several hours and all we had wanted was to crawl into bed at that point. Then when they did find it, they didn't have the room we had paid for (deluxe king) and tried to stick us in a 2 double room. They ended up putting us in a king room, but I think it was the room of last resort and was miles away and in poor repair, we ended up checking out first thing the next morning and never really trying any of the facilities.  This stay we called on the way up to make sure our reservation was in the system and got checked in right away when we arrived. We made use of various dining options during our stay (in-room, pool, etc) and everything we ate was quite delicious. My wife is a vegetarian and I'm carnivore, so we usually have trouble for one of us, but we found options to make us both happy, which was great. Staff was very courteous and fairly attentive. We didn't bother to try for a \"deluxe\" room this time after the experience last time and we were quite happy with it, we had a view of the golf course which was perfectly acceptable to us. We went for a nice walk along the trail that runs along parts of the golf course, it was well maintained and quite enjoyable. We also took the boat ride that runs between the hotel and the Rawhide western place, just did the roundtrip late in the evening and it was also quite peaceful and enjoyable.  I wouldn't compare this place to a serious resort like a Ritz, but for the price, I would say we were very happy this time. One remaining complaint about the property in general is that it is very laterally laid out, so the hike from the front desk to your room or room to pool, spa, etc is pretty long. It makes for good exercise, but if you are looking to be fairly lazy, keep that in mind.  We really wanted to try their Kai restaurant which has amazing reviews, but unfortunately we were checking in late on Saturday and out on Monday and Kai is closed on Sunday and Monday."}
{"text":"Love this place! My wife and I come here every year for our anniversary. Everything from the food the staff, the scenery even the amenities are top notch. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Our first and last stay at this resort. Pool was full of bugs and roaches. Staff was not in a hurry to clear up the floating insects.   Beds/pillows were hard nothing heavenly about this property!  And roaches in our room!  The front desk had no care when we mentioned have a roach in our room!   Terrible stay!"}
{"text":"2stars at best.  Rooms were borderline, poor housekeeping, pool could use attention, pool restrooms dirty, pool maintenance, re: pool water appeared dirty. When checking out, i was charged for valet services i didn't use and had to argue with the front staff to have the charge removed. The front staff person said management was unavailable to help settle the overcharges on my bill. Our room a/c didn't cool as expected, house cleaning wasn't done one day.  Pool side furniture was soiled with bird feces and looked well worn.  There were no towels for the pool till late,pool staff were asked to at least bring bath towels dpwn for the children to use, but nothing was done.  Our room smelled of sewer gases one night.  All in all, I'll choose somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Great experience at the Wild Horse Pass Resort & Spa.  Friendly staff.  Resort is away from other businesses/residences so it is secluded and quiet.  Has a few pools (one with a slide) and a couple jacuzzis.  Rooms were spacious and clean.  The rooms can be a little far from the parking lots so be prepared to walk a little distance.  Overall, very relaxing. I would definitely consider staying here again the next time I am in Arizona for Spring Training."}
{"text":"I am a current guest at the resort. The staff here is very accommodating and helpful. My family comes to spring training from all over the west coast as a little get together before the family summer vacation. We decided to stay at the resort eve though it is on the outskirts of Phoenix and only close to the Angles stadium. Again the service is what one would expect from this type of resort.  +'s: Staff is friendly and accommodating  Rooms are quiet and clean Grounds are clean and presentable Grounds are relaxing and inviting Kids love the pool area.  Phoenix is awesome this time of year.  Very quiet and off the \"beaten path\". Walking paths around the grounds are nice hikes.  Dog friendly.   -'s: Hours of operation where cut short: pool bar was to stay open until 9:00pm closed at. 8:15 with a party of 10 without drinks. A resort should have staff on until the hours posted. Don't save a buck on my vacation. Just because occupancy is low I want to come here after a game and not have to leave until the next game.  Resort me!!!  Came back to my room at 4:00 Pm and room was not made up. Understand it was Easter but again paying resort prices come here to relax. Don't save money on staff at your customers dime. The reason for 4 ****'s.   In short if you are looking to kick back in the Phoenix and take in some Spring training games I would recommend this place. Just remember you will have to drive a ways to do things."}
{"text":"Although they bill themselves as a fine resort, this more of a second- or third-rate destination.  On the positive side, it is attractive and I liked the integration of Native American design.  However, the service and amenities left a lot to be desired.  With the exception of Kai (their fanciest restaurant), everyone seemed to be focused on \"just doing their job\"; I had no sense that anyone was trying to provide a higher level of service.  I think that the staff would benefit from visiting one of the other resorts in the area to see the effort and attention to detail that goes into a truly high-end resort.  Their facilities are similarly modest; the pools are small and (during our visit) quite dirty.  I also felt that the circles of chairs surrounding the hot tubs (clearly to keep someone from falling in and hurting themselves) were a little strange and indicative of a \"just do the minimum\" attitude.  My lasting impression is that this resort is amateurish.  I won't return."}
{"text":"I gotta give this place 5 stars because well... this is MY rez! :D  The Sheraton Wild Horse Pass is located on the Gila River Indian Community which is home to me! Cher T.! :D I really do like this place. I've been there maaaaany times performing or just looking about. I like the traditional art work on display outside the ball rooms as well as all the photography and paintings in the hallways.  On the celing of the two story lobby, is a mural of our creation story and ways of life. I hope you like it.  I have never eaten at any of WHP's resturants, but let me tell you... Kai is CRAZY expensive!! I've heard of ppl paying nearly $100 a head! that's insane to me! But hey, if you have the money honey... Kai totally has the time! Also another note in Kai, their food is a nice homage to traditional O'odham food, but it's not all the way there... there's tthings on that menu that some O'odham won't eat. Like Buffalo. But I'm told its a great fancy-shmancy place to go when u want to get laid... or save ur marriage as one councilmen joked.  I have no idea what non-community members pay for rooms there, but the rate has prolly went up since it hosted the NY Giants during this past super bowl. But either way... if you've got the dougn to spend on a nice place, this is it and I'm told the water slide kicks ASS!! Or if you're at the casino and am waaay tired of fighting old ppl for the last piece of fried chicken at the casino buffet and just want something nice and quiet and you just hit it big at the blackjack table... then take the soonest boat and treat yourself to a meal at the resort!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's very spiritual and calming. I've been visiting and staycationing for seven years. The rooms are nice with Native American art and blankets. Very comfortable beds. The bathrooms are lovely with separate shower and tub.  The grand foyer is beautiful as is the huge patio with fire pits. The pools are nice but I must admit they aren't keeping up with my kid's ages. We started going when the boys were 3 & 5 - now they are 10 & 12 and looking for higher slides and a lazy river.  We do enjoy the short boat rides to the Western Town. They have a running path about 1.5 miles long out into the desert and near the golf course. We enjoy walking near the little river and sitting on the little grass island. We have golfed here it's a Troon golf course and beautiful.  A visit here is typically a serene weekend for us watching the horses, bunnies and birds."}
{"text":"Stayed here  11/21/16. Upon arriving , the AC in the room did not work. The maintenence guy  was in and out of our room (3kids, and the wife) for at least an hour while trying to get the kids settled down after a long road trip. Tried calling to get an upgraded room, was told there weren't any. After I was told that, I went on their website and found plenty of available rooms. I feel I wasn't given the level of customer service deserved due to I booked the room on hotels.com.  The area around the hotel is nice as well as the resorts grounds, rooms are a little small honestly, and I feel you are not treated as a regular guest if you book 3rd party. Location from the parking lot to the room was a very, very long walk as well with terrible elevator locations , making it even more cumbersome.   All in all, I don't really recommend this hotel as their customer service support was not that great at all. Like said above, even though they were under booked, I feel I was treated different because I booked 3rd party. Ie..hotels.com, Expedia, priceline, Orbitz. Not cool!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting here the day after my wedding upset. We were staying here for our wedding and I would rate the service close to 3 stars. Since I was getting my hair and makeup done in the room, I asked for an extra chair. The lady said that was just not possible. I've attended conferences here for work and there are literally at least 2000 chairs somewhere. The lady said sorry, but I don't know what to do. I told the lady to please ask her manager and that I was getting married that day. I did end up receiving an extra chair, but felt I was asking for an absurd request.   We also wanted to dine at Kai restaurant. They had absolutely no availability for guests and had to book weeks in advance. I mentioned the special occasion, but all she did was offer to be put on a waiting list that would unlikely happen. There are only two restaurants on property and the other one got 3 stars so we didn't want to dine there either. There are dozens of resorts in Arizona that would deliver exceptional service.  Their is no point in staying here unless you are ok with paying hundreds of dollars a night for a tiny room, uncomfortable bed, thin walls and 1 star service. There is what they call a river, which looks like a swampy canal where they offer water activities. I would be afraid of being but by mosquitoes the entire time and the green water did not appear inviting."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Love this place.  For sure will be staying here when I come back.  Awesome food, great resort and slept like a baby in their rooms.  This place is beautiful you will not be disappointed.  Price seemed very lie compared to what I was paying in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Courteous, attentive staff. Spotless, well-appointed rooms with the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. Delicious room service. Immaculate grounds with a beautiful drive from the freeway--we saw many wild animals on the way. The pool area is beautiful. We enjoyed our entire stay and were sad for our time there to end."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the look of the hotel very peaceful away from other hotels. You can tell they really spent time incorporating the Indian aspect and cultural to showcase the great scenery and nature. Lobby is gorgeous and has cozy sitting areas around everywhere. They have a computers set up with calming music throughout. The pool is great I believe there is 3 and 2 hot tubs. A great water slide and the scenery of nature around you. Very relaxing. The rooms are super clean with a balcony to sit and take it in. I can't say enough about the staff at the door they always asked if they could help or if we needed anything! Shuttle to casino is easy to catch and a nice convenience! We'll done!"}
{"text":"I do love the location, it's quiet and beautiful. The pool is great and the trails are aplenty. If you come for golf you won't be disappointed. I did not. I found the staff nice enough, but there were things I was less than happy about. The screen door for the balcony was off the tracks, eliminating that option, the jacuzzi was luke warm, possibly to accommodate a younger clientele, bad idea anyhow, pool area was poorly lit at night, and dinner was served with 20 minutes between first meal placed and last meal placed, down stairs restaurant. Also at that restaurant, breakfast buffet was poorly stocked, running out of small pancakes and eggs during my one meal. Prices are ridiculous for the service and quality. To be fair, dinner was quite tasty when it all arrived. Aside from a location I love, I will avoid this hotel in the future."}
{"text":"Avoid this place like the plague, sars, bird flu, take your pick, but don't give this place your hard earned money.  We'll never come back!!  This review is from the past two days.   Just got here for staycation.  Nice place but they sure set the tone for an irritating visit by charging $5 for a popsicle for the kids at their 4th of July bounce house function.  I get charging more than retail for the convenience, but that pissed me off something fierce.  A 2,000% markup is a bit extreme you greedy bastards!  When we got to our room the first thing I noticed is a tablet pc pointing at the bed next to the tv.  Those tablets have cameras in them!!! I unplugged it, flipped it down and covered it up.  That seems so weird to me that a hotel would put a camera inside your room.  I'm sure if we asked, they would say it's disabled, but it only takes one disgruntled sys admin to activate and record.  I'm sure they call it a \"feature\" but I don't trust it, especially after being here a couple days.   Tried to go to the pool bar at 9:55 pm since they close at 10. Of course, they had already packed up.  Yup, my irritation continues.  We stuck a couple drinks in the mini bar fridge.  Housekeeping locked it and I'm guessing left our drinks inside, they aren't anywhere to be found! What a bunch of a holes!  #update:  When my wife called and complained the fridge has been locked, someone showed up with a key within about 5 minutes.  That's not enough to bump this up to 2 stars, but fair is fair.  We'll see if we get charged now.  Looking at the fridge, I'm not sure if someone locked it after, or if nobody shut it before since it looks like it auto locks.   The shower lost pressure several times during a single shower to the point I thought someone was turning it off on me.  Maybe they busted me using my own soap and shampoo??  I was going to up this to a 2 star rating because there is a twisty water slide the kids liked at the pool, but after all that other crap, no way.  This place is 1 star all the way.     Sorry this is so long and there is an abundance of exclamation points, but these greedy bastards deserve every one and more! (Okay, one last exclamation to show my hatred of these people)   One last thing.  This room is supposed to be 2 queen beds, I can't say they aren't, but they seem really small to me. When I finally get to leave this place I'll measure it against my daughter's full sized mattress.  I marked my phone charger cable so I have a reference."}
{"text":"Stayed here over the weekend for a golf tournament. Great luxury resort with a pool and restaurants inside. The hotel room was nice and spacious too. I think the highlight was the staff...they were all super friendly, well trained, and helpful. I haven't experienced great customer service like that in awhile. It is pricey though at $500 for 2 nights for a room."}
{"text":"Hmmmm... first off WIFI IS NOT FREE!!!! You have to pay $13 (I believe everyday) for it. For my review I will say the hotel itself is very beautiful and staff was nice but other than that, at least for these hot summer months, i don't think it is worth the stay.  To get to the hotel was confusing in itself. There aren't that many signs displayed indicating where the actual lobby is while driving there. And if you don't do the valet parking you have to self park and then go through a maze of the resort to even get to the front desk to check in.  It's July and the temperatures are reshaping over 100 degrees and I swear the pool was probably 90 degrees. The pool was SO warm it felt disgusting to even be in because it offered no refreshing coolness to the unforgiving hot summer in AZ. You think for such a nice resort they would keep the pool at at least 70 degrees when it's 100+ outside. So needless to say I got in the pool for about 3 minutes and got out.  We also did the water activities  while we were there (paddling boarding, kayaking, etc) which were really neat. HOWEVER, getting to those were again, yet another maze through the resort. No signs listed. Nothing on the brochure on how to actually get there, didn't know if we had to schedule a session or just show up. The experience was cool, but again, we did it around 9am so it was already about 90 degrees and even though the keep the little river all chlorinated and clean, the river itself was about 90 degrees and not refreshing to cool off in at all which made the water activities pretty miserable. Tried calling guest services at 8:30am and the phone kept ringing, tried calling the reservation line and it gave me a busy tone. Then eventually I called the resorts number to have no one answer and was told to leave a voicemail  Honestly I just think it was disappointing. I was really excited to stay here because my friend had flown in.   If you are staying here between the months of September - May it's probably worth it. But to stay here in the summer? Have fun swimming in a 95 degree pool when it's 103 outside."}
{"text":"What a nice place...!! Views are great and the pool was nice as well! Rooms were clean as well. My issue and why I see this as 3 stars is the hidden 21.00 charge per night for things I didn't use during my stay like this gym for instance... With sooo many choices in the Phoenix/ Tucson area to go to for a staycation I just will not be back"}
{"text":"Great resort in Chandler that is close to 10 but feels like it is miles away from civilization.  Great set of pools and unbelievable scenery.  The gym is adequate but the running trail is a huge bonus.  Quiet and scenic it offers you the opportunity to engage with the local flora/fauna on a 2.5 mile round trip.  Really nice touch.  I will continue to stay here when traveling into the Phoenix area.  Room service menu is somewhat limited but the onsite restaurant serves quality food for breakfast.  Not the fastest restaurant, but the food is worth the wait and the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"Nice resort and good place for a business meeting. Rooms are big and comfortable. Friendly staff, but off the beaten path a little so cabs need to be called well in advance. Will Uber next time.  Golf course and spa on the grounds. Horse back riding too. Casino nearby.  Impressive Lobby, but it smelled a bit like a water treatment facility because of the chlorinated waterfalls. Sort of a sewer stench.  Nice pool area. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Large resort in the desert. Great pool area, with the chairs that have flags to raise to get service. Plus it's pet friendly."}
{"text":"Attending a conference here and the hotel employees are so nice and helpful. Rooms are really spread out and is a long walk from the lobby/convention space if in the Pima wing. Views from room are beautiful as the property is very well maintained and landscaped. The halls do get loud in the morning when people are leaving the rooms and you can hear neighboring room noise. Bar and food prices are high as you are basically isolated on the property. Overall a beautiful place, it is pricey but seems to include a lot of amenities and great service/employees."}
{"text":"WARNING to all considering staying here over New Year's 2016/2017! Unless you love the constant beat of the world's worst music, this is an example of what you'll hear until 3AM. Despicable and the crowd this brings-the worst. Oh, and don't stay anywhere near here as you can't escape it. https://mobile.twitter.com/ThomasTurnerAZ/status/800225763026833408/video/1"}
{"text":"Long story short...kinda expensive.  I'm not gonna lie, I'm not the world's biggest fan of fancy resorts, pool side lounges and fancy drinks that costs as much as a very satisfying meal from a hole-in-the-wall restaurant (where I clearly have an affinity towards). That being said, this resort does have some plus and minuses.  Pros: Very clean, has a cool Native American vibe with soft flute music playing at nearly every corridor. Friendly and helpful staff, very eager to help. There is a waterslide, multiple pools, and a resort running path. The rooms are very large, well equipped, big TV's and have balconies.  Cons: Really expensive. The gym, while it's available is really small (for a resort) and there are no classes (such as yoga, spinning) that are present at some of the other fancy places. The pool side drinks and food are really $$$ and ok...but not mindblowingly amazing.  Overall...I had a decent time, but could have done much more with that money."}
{"text":"Being back her for the second time in 5 years I was really looking forward to getting back. I would have to say that they have done some improvements to the resort since I was last there in 2009 and it was for the better. The rooms are pretty solid and I had a great view this time in the Pima Wing. We were there for our Annual Conference and our members really enjoy this resort.  Only problem that a few members on staff had was their rooms not being cleaned even though it was requested. We are now worried that some of our members didn't get their's cleaned either -- which is just uncalled for really. I'm not sure what broke down there with the house keeping staff, but that should be addressed when you have members looking for a great experience for what they are paying per night.  Food was excellent over the course of the week. David and Maria took care of me and our group all week and I am certainly pumped about making it back out to Phoenix in the future.  We had some mosquito issues this year that we didn't have in 2009-- still dealing with the after effects of those bites on my legs."}
{"text":"I had to write a review for this resort because it is one of my favorite places on the planet.  There is something that is just so darn relaxing about the place!  I usually go every year in the fall and occasionally in the spring before it gets too hot.  I have always had great service from the hotel staff and in both of the restaurants.   The hotel is great, but the really AMAZING part of the resort is the Spa and two golf courses.  The spa is one of the best I've ever been to and the golf courses are immaculate.  There are no housing developments surrounding the golf courses which really makes it unique and the guests get to enjoy the true beauty of the desert."}
{"text":"Lovely. Just finished my second vacation there.  If you are looking for a relaxing poolside vacation in the sun and heat this is the place."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Sheraton for a convention and while the actual grounds and facilities are very nice, there is a lot to be desired as anything but a company paid destination, I would never go again. I am a gold Starwood member, so stay at a lot of Sheraton properties.  I'm used to paying resort rates for food, drinks and service, but this place is over the top on their prices. There is a lack of mid prices choices for dining as my number one complaint.  They have two restaurants a $$$$ and a $$$ priced choice. It really should be $$$$$ and $$$$. At there mid priced restaurant  a Filet is $38. and everything else was also priced as a high priced place. I  would hate to see what the prices are at the high end restaurant.  They have a lobby bar and for anyone who goes to conventions, many times this would be a gathering spot and for eating in a casual manor. Well if you could squeeze 10 people in, it would be a stretch. They are missing the boat here as the bar was tiny. Never did get to buy a drink there.  Went on a Saturday morning at 8:30 am to the small coffee shop, guess what they were out of almost all there food choices. Get a clue Sheraton, there are no walk in customers, you know how many people will be at the facility on any given day, plan accordingly!  I had shipped a package to the facility by UPS. I tracked it and it arrived as scheduled on a Thursday. Guess what, no call as to it's arrival. I finally called at 4:00PM on the Friday asking it be delivered to my room and they said they would send it up. 6 hours later still no box. I ended up tracking it down on Saturday.  The only room issue we had was the doors slam when they close, so as soon as the first person leaves their room in the morning, you get your morning wake-up slam. Also if anyone is talking in the hall, it sound like they are standing next to you in your room.  So for my $ there are a lot better choices. The Sheraton's overprice will cost them in the long run as they will not have repeat customers. To bad, nice grounds, but customers notice what is lacking. I was wondering why there were so few people staying there with the exception of one day, but after staying there I can see why it was not crowded."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed here for two nights during a conference he was attending in the hotels conference center.  Our room was nice enough and the resort grounds were beautiful.  We didn't get to expierience all that this place has to offer with only being there 3 days and having all of the meals and activities planned for us by the company running the conference.    There were a few things that could have made our stay better.  First of all as many other reviewers have stated the rooms were very warm.  I understand that it was 107 degrees outside during our stay and that this can make it difficult to cool the indoors properly but I just can't sleep well if I'm too warm.  There has got to be some sort of solution they could come up with to remedy this situation.  Secondly it was impossible to get any sort of cold water out of the faucet in out room.  I must say drinking warm water is not very refreshing and I never could find the ice machine.  On a side note most of the other \"resort\" hotels I have stayed at placed buckets of fresh ice in our rooms daily so I was a little surprised this one does not, of course it would not have been a big deal if I could have found an ice machine on my own.  Third and perhaps the most annoying thing about this hotel is the layout/ size.  The walk from our room to the conference center was literally 15 minutes one way.  I'm certainly not the fastest walker in the world but I'm also not the slowest either. This definitely made for some tired feet and legs after having to walk back and forth at least 3 times per day.  For those of you counting that's an hour and a half everyday just walking to and from the meetings and meals.  I will also add that this was not just a long walk but a confusing one as well.  The only way to get across the hotel was to wind through the halls on our floor to the elevator, go up to the lobby, cut across the lobby to another elevator and take that back down to the floor with the conference center, then walk the last half a mile down a hallway to the meeting rooms we were assigned to.  It seems a little crazy that this was the only way to get to where we were going and after getting lost trying to simply take that first elevator down to the correct floor (skipping the jaunt across the lobby) I even asked at the front desk if there was a quicker/easier way and was told no.    Overall I might stay here again but if it were for another conference I would definitely request a room closer to the conference center.  The front desk staff were friendly and helpful each time I dealt with them and even helped me solve a billing issue I had with the spa.  This could have been a four star review if it weren't for all that unexpected walking."}
{"text":"The grounds are lovely with an interpretive walking trail and paved route along their Gila river that allow you to see great blue heron, turtles, water fowl...and golfers. Sweeping views of the mountains, friendly pool service and cocktails made this a relaxing and recharging girl's weekend out."}
{"text":"Honestly the only good thing about this hotel is that it is beautiful and on gorgeous grounds. Other than that, I was given wrong directions by the front desk on how to get there twice, spent 30 min driving around only to find my own way (a way the front desk staff didn't know exisits) then when I asked the front desk for suggestions on a good taco place I went sent the most horrible place I have ever been for tacos... BARF. That night I took a shuttle to the casino and asked the front desk staff what time the last shuttle returns people back to the hotel.. She told me 1:30am so I went to the casino and as I was leaving at 1am the front desk man at the casino said the last shuttle was at midnight.   So all in all the front desk knows ABSOLUTLEY Nothing, they guide people in the wrong directions and have no clue about any questions.  And to top it all off I watched the cleaning lady change my sheets in the morning and my NEW CLEAN sheets had blood stains on them!   Enough said."}
{"text":"I was there for Training last week.  Everyone seems to mention the long walk to there room.  Really not that big of a deal.  Room was very clean and really nice.  Ate at the Lobby Bar.  Food was served fast and was very good.  The staff was friendly and nice.  I'm sorry I do not remember there names to mention them.  They deserve to be mentioned.  On check out I still need to get my boarding pass and the clerk at the front desk said it was not problem to print it out for me.  Saved me a lot of time.    Great service all around.  Everyone was friendly & nice!!!  5 Stars all around!!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is breathtaking.  From the waterfall on the inside to the great view on the outside, I felt as though everything was well kept.  Parking was easy and plentiful.  While I didn't eat at any of the restaurants, the food look very appetizing and I would like to dine at one during my next visit.  The shops were fun, too."}
{"text":"We spent Labor Day weekend here and had a marvelous time.  It wasn't too crowded considering it was a holiday.  We spent the day laying by the pool. My 6 year old twins had a blast going down the water slide.  Our poolside server ,Ryan, was a gent!  He was extremely friendly and gave us great service the whole day.  The menu prices were very reasonable. My Bloody Mary ($10)  was one of the best I have ever had. Nice and spicy.  We ordered the BLT ($12) which was mediocre and the chicken strips and fries ($10) , was actually delicious.  The crowd vibe was nice and chill. Mainly families with young kids.  We really enjoyed our time there.   Everyone was very welcoming and patient with all the children.  Beautiful grounds, I enjoyed my walk alone along the paths with water features.   We can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Peaceful resort with beautiful views but they need to work on their customer service and upkeep of the rooms.  We checked in to find a wad of hair in the shower drain, the shower smelled of sewage and water pressure drastically changed while showering. We asked to switch rooms and waited over an hour for bellman to deliver new keys. Finally went to retrieve them at the front desk and saw bellman on the way. He had 'mini bar' keys with him and not new room key. Continued journey to front desk (a very long walk at this hotel) to retrieve key.  No shower issues in this room but iron sprayed black all over husband's shirt and mirrored light in bathroom doesn't work.  We're here for a week and this is only day two. I hope our stay improves as we've always been loyal guests here."}
{"text":"Gorgeous grounds, impeccable service, top-notch food -- so why only four stars? I stayed here three nights for a work conference.   Akin to a Vegas casino hotel, my room was a good 15 minute walk to the conference area, and due to poor design, I had to walk to an elevator, go up two floors, walk another 100 yards through the hotel lobby, then head back down the two floors via elevator or stairs.  It was more than slightly ridiculous.    I'd have thought that my Starwood Preferred Guest Gold status would earn me a better room; alas, I was stuck across from the ice machine and precisely where housekeeping (all of whom were incredibly nice and professional) would leave their cart. And it's where people decided to leave their used room service trays, for some unknown reason.   The internet was painfully slow, even using the cable.   If you go here for a conference, ask to be on the same side as the conference center, or at least ask to be on the 3rd floor if you're on the other side, or at least remotely closer to the elevator.   On the plus side, I can't say enough about how friendly each staff member is at this place.  It's well insulated, so you're not able to hear those in neighboring rooms, which is a definite plus, too."}
{"text":"This is really a great secluded place from the hub bub, great spa, and very good restaraunt. GOOD FOR ADULTS. OK for families (young kids 2-10)  Pros quiet peaceful outdoor activities horseback riding and trails golf course is on premises   Cons not as kid friendly, so not great for families with young kids (2-10) hotel rooms are ok, not great..but well kept. not much on the resort for kids  This is a great place for adults, not so great for families with young kids. Still very fun and entertaining. I would recommend and the spa is very good.  My experience here had some glitches as well  There are 6 pools, only 2 were heated mildly, the other 4 were ice cold, and not warm or at all possible to swim in.  There were 3 hot tubs, and all of them were luke warm at best, not worth sitting in because they were cold. They said they called maintenance and the guy never came out, it was for 7 hours.  These were kind of disappointing because when you go from Chicago to AZ and the pools arent heated, its kind of a bummer. It was 75 every day but the pools were ass cold, total bummer.  staff was great but the pool experience made it kind of suck."}
{"text":"I'd go back nice rooms and bath area is also nice. Great views, great for a staycation getaway"}
{"text":"They decided to up the rate of the room by $50/night without mentioning it to me for the duration of my stay. Working with their customer service is horrendous. They keep bouncing me back and forth between a service center and the hotel. It's been a week and I still don't know why the rate changed from the agreed upon rate."}
{"text":"I had a couple of rooms booked at this hotel and wanted to have my 2 yr old daughters birthday there. We had about 15 other families that were also going to join us and stay at the hotel as well. I have stayed here many times before and was wondering if they could store a birthday cake for me in their freezer. I spoke to the Food and Beverage Manager and proceeded to tell him about the celebration and what I was asking for. He said that they couldn't store in their freezers and we couldn't bring it down to the pool since it was against policy. I was fine with that but then he decided to also tell me their guest policy which was that we could not invite or have anyone at the pool who was not staying at the hotel. I was blasted by his statement because in no way would we do that and all of our guests were staying there. Did he think I was uncle Jethro and bringing the Beverly Hillbillies? What the hell? I didn't know why the Food and Beverage Manager would be explaining the guest policy to someone who was asking about storing a cake. I think he made an assumption that was totally incorrect. I have cancelled all of my rooms and will inform my party goers to do so as well. Terrible training for a manager and maybe he should think before he speaks. NEVER will I stay at the Resort again.   Good luck."}
{"text":"I think this hotel deserves 5 stars if only Alexandria at the Ko sin restaurant was mindful enough to ask my companion if he's done with his plate before attempting to take it away & charging me $34+ for in-room dining I didn't order. The resort fee $27/day added up to my bill was, I think, hefty. I got disoriented for a sec thinking I was in San Diego LOL.... HOTEL LOBBY: Gorgeous southwestern-inspired. Mural was magnificent & a lot of rich Native American paintings. It's not as grand as a 5-stars hotel(some of these hotel are stuffy, anyways) but it has that cozy, inviting appeal to get a drink & lounge for a while....and let me tell this, THIS HOTEL HAS THE MOST INVITINGLY, CLEAN & SWEET SMELLING SURROUNDING FROM LOBBY TO THE WALKWAYS GOING TO OUR ROOM. I've been to some really great & expensive hotels but the smell of this one has outdone the rest, hands down!   FRONT DESK: i requested Justin for a room NOT overlooking the parking lot. He granted me a Starwood Preferred too facing a bit of a view of the man-made lake for boating. But hey, it was nicer as compared to a parking lot view, right? LOL.....when I needed a drink, he was accommodating enough to move out behind the desk & point to me as to where the bar & resto are. Little gestures like that win points from me:)  ROOM: Decent room, enough space to move around....balcony wasn't big but was ok. I like the bathroom. The tub is separate from the glass encased shower area.....and not generic coffee but Starbucks coffee pods!  FOOD: a little bit salty. Presentation is ok. Expensive tho. They only serve breakfast buffet on Sundays:( We went for a stroll & the area is pretty neat. Pool has slides! There's a boat trekking the man-made lake for a fee. Truly a definition of what a resort is. I am intending on coming back here to have the kids check it out soon. It's not that far from the city. Just over less than a mile from the outlet. It's a pretty good weekend retreat. I will recommend and be back & when I do, I hope Justin is the one working that day. He's easy to talk to & although he looks very young, I can see he takes his work seriously by providing top-notch service. You rock dude:)"}
{"text":"Live music in the lobby bar echos throughout the check-in area and you feel peaceful the second you drive up to the front doors. The hotel is really pretty in a Native Arizona style and rich with culture and history.   We loved the pool, breakfast outdoors overlooking the pool and golf course, the golf was great, and the live music in the lobby was awesome. Night time you can see the stars and the fire-pits are lit outside providing that chill escape. You'd never know except for having seen it in your drive in that you're 8 minutes from the casino and outlet mall. you feel secluded and relaxed away from the hustle and bustle.   Negatives: Don't Order Room Service if You actually want to eat what you order: We arrived late on a Thursday night- 10 PM- with just enough time to check-in, grab a beer, and go down to the hot-tub before the pool area shut down. We stopped by the bar after relaxing in the hot-tub and grabbed another round of drinks and tried to order food- bar kitchen was closed- which seemed fair since it was now almost 11 PM. So we ordered room service to our room. They told us on the phone  it would be 40 minutes. 1 hour and 15 minutes later- no food. We finally gave up and went to sleep. In the morning we visited the front desk to voice our grievances and they showed no record of the room service order. So had we stayed up waiting we never would have gotten food.   Our room: We were given an SPG preferred guest room. We are platinum SPG  guests- but we did book a pre-paid lowest guaranteed rate (so maybe that's why the cruddy room)- we were placed in a preferred guest room - but it had no view- just a massive tree blocking the golf course and desert we so desired to see. It did have a balcony. It was TINY and it had no robes, even though we had requested them.   Check-out: Having worked in a hotel, I am a firm believer in using hotel services, like bellmen and tipping them well. I called in advance and I also notified a bellman in person that I needed help with our bags since my husband was on the golf course and we needed to get checked-out of our room by check-out time. I gave a specific time I needed help and twenty minutes notice. No one showed up- I had to call twice. I finally grabbed all four of our bags and started hauling them down the hallway -when I saw a bellman headed in the direction of our room. He apologized (and was very kind) and gave me a hand. Just annoying when you hear bellmen venting about people handling their own bags yet when you ask for help it takes over an hour to get someone to your door.    Loved the actual hotel and location just wish a few things had gone smoother and a better room location. Super nice staff- except for the coffee girl at the cafe in the morning. Her \"give-a-hoot\" meter was at a zero.   I want to give it another try."}
{"text":"I have to update this to a 5 star rating as we went there for a grandmother's 80th birthday with the whole family and we had an AMAZING time!  The resort is fantastic, the staff is friendly, and the staff at the pool has either A) Lightened up, or B) Been replaced.  Excellent resort, relaxing experience, overall phenomenal staff and great food!  The manager even had the cook reopen the kitchen to make us a custom appetizer platter at 12AM one night as he knew we all didn't get to see eachother often and wanted to make us feel welcomed.  I will be back frequently."}
{"text":"We had a great time at this hotel. Rode in on our harley and valet let us park right in front. Hotel is very clean and new feeling. All the food we had was great. It is a bit secluded, but we took Uber to Chandler for dinner and it was 12.00 so not a huge deal. Super cool vibe. Everyone working there went out of their way to make us feel good. Thanks for the great visit."}
{"text":"This is a lovely resort, but more of an effort should be made to rid the lobby bar of flies...The spa is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Awful front desk staff, actually we were dealing with the front desk manager.  She was totally incompetant and not willing to help, very arrogant and stuck up.   We asked for a room upgrade and got a cold shoulder, I guess they don't like giving room upgrades in this hotel.  As Sammy S said in his review they kicked him out!!!!    I don't think I'll be going back to this hotel considering all the other choices I have."}
{"text":"The five stars are for the managers and staff of the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Resort. They were phenomenal during the three day event my company hosted at the resort. Food was delicious and on time. Chef catered to special diets, bartenders remembered what guests were drinking, servers immediately attended requests, whatever the need - they were there to provide an excellent experience. It was unfortunate we came during some renovations but, it did not interfere with our busy schedule. I look forward to being there again next year."}
{"text":"PROS: there's a free transit bus for special events (prevents drinking & driving/high taxi fares), Beautiful view, water slide, military rate  CONS: Rooms are extremely small for the price, there's a $25 resort fee but the hotel doesn't offer much to constitute that, No fridge (it's key locked), no microwave"}
{"text":"3.5 STARS  Attended a conference there and the facility was great. The bed was comfortable, the weight room at the spa had everything you need to get a workout. This resort is 4 stars for those within its price range, and 3 stars overall just because the hotel & casino isn't connected together. But there is a shuttle that comes every 15 minutes that takes you to the outlet or casino for FREE."}
{"text":"This is a peaceful property. It's huge draw is that it's away from the hustle and bustle of the city, which can be good and less than ideal. It can be good if you plan to just reside on the resort, including eating all of your meals there. It's less than ideal if you want to venture out because you can expect to drive a minimum of 15-20 minutes to get anywhere.  The landscaping is well done, the staff is very friendly. The rooms are very basic and a little dated, even with the Native American themes. So if you want plush, I am not sure you'll get that. Not sure what they suite rooms look likes. The resort is also very family-friendly. I saw a ton of young children at the major pool.  I understand why a lot of the people looking for more quiet head over to the \"Spa\" area as it houses another pool, the Aji Spa, and the fitness center. THIS pool was heaven. We went prior to having some spa treatments done. Aji Spa DID NOT disappoint. I'll save those comments for another review.  It's a great property for being outdoors. I saw tons of people on the trails and on the golf course. There is a shuttle that will run you around until 2am (every 15 minutes), so be on the lookout for that if you do not drive (but I recommend you do).  Last thing to note are the other charges per day.. $20 resort fee (waived if you are a platinum member) and $22 valet. Self-parking can be a bit of a hike depending on the location of your room."}
{"text":"I stayed here many years ago for work and it has always been my intention to come back - it was that special.  Back again for work and expecting to do more travel in the coming year - and this is a repeat place for sure.  Any time I come to Arizona - I plan to stay here.  It is a beautiful place, the service is amazing, the rooms are super clean and nice - and as a welcome back, the hotel sent up (I believe via the very nice young woman who checked me in tonight - Carolina - a lovely antipasto plate!  wow...I got the knock at the door and had that moment of \"ummmm...nobody knows I am here !!!\" and am I glad I answered the knock.  What a surprise treat and special touch.   Thank you Carolina & Sheraton !  You made a long trip have a very nice ending tonight!"}
{"text":"This place was really pretty and I enjoyed most of my stay here.  Where it lost a star was the air conditioning in the rooms was really annoying.  Phoenix is hot and you really need good AC in a hotel that is in the middle of the desert.  At night, no matter how cold me set it, it kept shutting off and then turning back on 3 min later. But, the on/off kept waking us up. IN addition, it would get really warm and uncomfortable.  So, we had a terrible night sleep. As for the pluses: -the views were gorgeous -the staff was friendly -they had a neat plan where if you opted out of housekeeping for a day they'd give you a $5 credit at the bar.   -there were a lot of amenities.  Unfortunately, we didn't get to take advantage of too many of them."}
{"text":"The facility is beautiful. I stayed for 4 nights for a conference and was impressed with the level of attention the staff placed on their guests.  You are hit with a lovely aroma from the spa candles as you check in that makes you want to get a massage right there. Unfortunately I was too busy to enjoy those amenities however I overheard other guests raving about their experience. Dinner at Kai proved to be one of the best meals I have had in a long time. The service, view and dinner where all five star. If you go try the margarita / martini that is rimmed with salt and pink peppercorn. Phenomenal!  I will go back just to relax. If you go be sure to take a walk along the 2 mile walking path earliy in the morning. Its a great way to start your day. And golf too!"}
{"text":"Came here for a weekend gateway with the family in mid August.  The rate was fair and the staffs were very friendly and super nice.   The resort was not crowded at all, and there were plenty of room for kids to enjoy the pools and slides.  On top of that there were many activities for the kids to participate by the pool.  We also rented paddle boards and kayak from the River Adventure.  The person working at the rental was super nice and helpful.  We will definitely return to this resort in the future."}
{"text":"Spring break trip. Location is ok. Kind of suburban. Gotta drive everywhere which I expected.  Close to South mountain for hiking. Property is getting run down. Elevators were flat out dirty. Room was clean but old. Staff was excellent. The only saving grace. Pool was meh. Pool furniture  need replacing. Fitness center needs a lap pool.  Food at poolside cafe was flat out bad. Saw a rat at the pool. And the birds are very aggressive. A little gross. It is next to a river so u will get more wildlife but not for me. Will not be back."}
{"text":"We loved how they integrated Native American culture and art into the general architecture, common areas and guest rooms with respect to the culture and without making it seem like a gimmick. Room was clean and beautiful, with great artwork, and had an awesome view from the balcony. Staff was friendly and helpful. Bed was very comfortable. We slept great."}
{"text":"Food not good and over priced. Room service even more so.   $20 / day resort fee & $20 / day valet   Staff was SUPER tho   LONG up hill walk for self parking then long walk down hall to elevator & another long walk to room. But nice room with no fridge or microwave. Ha won't have left overs from downstairs anyway maybe doggy bag"}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed at the beautiful Sheraton Grand at Wild Horse Pass resort for 4 days and 3 nights (March 22nd - March 25th) to attend the 2018 Spectrum Superstars event, for which he was one of the few recipients receiving an award in recognition for his outstanding service. Spectrum truly spoiled the awardees and guests as everything was all-expense-paid including: round-trip airfare, all meals, open bar, gratuities for all hotel personnel, luggage handlers, ground transportation, activities, and other service personnel for the events included in this program. Also, all Superstars received a $250 American Express debit card for any extraneous expenses, so we literally just solely focused on fun and relaxation during our stay here.  Located in the high Sonoran Desert on an expanse of rugged Arizona landscape where the ancient vistas, mountains and roaming wild horses remain untouched, the resort was designed to be an authentic representation of the Gila River Indian heritage and culture. The architecture, design, art and legends of the Akimel O'otham and Pee Posh tribes are celebrated in every detail imaginable, indoors and out. The walking trails are simply beautiful and the landscaping is adorned with Palo Verde trees and Saguaros. This peaceful resort is very secluded and you will not see any remnants of your typical urban jungle for miles.  All hotel staff were very accommodating and the only problem we encountered was the iron in our room stained my husband's business meeting attire. Despite making two calls to guest services for bringing a replacement, there was no attempt made. I was going to deduct a star for that, but after completing a survey, customer service made it right by giving us 5000 Starwood Preferred Guest Points.  NOTES + Since this resort is secluded, you will have to find alternate transportation to venture off the premises. There is a free shuttle service that will take you to and from the Phoenix Premium Outlets, Wild Horse Pass & Casino, and Aji Spa & Salon. Speak to Guest Services regarding shuttle schedule and routes.  + We opted to enroll in the Make a Green Choice (MAGC) program where we omitted housekeeping. Additional towels and toiletries are available upon request, if needed. As a perk, you can choose from a $5 Food and Beverage Credit or 500 SPG Starpoints per day where you can redeem at several restaurants, room service, gift shop, bar, and a Starbucks on-site.  + Download the AttendeeHub app to get real time notifications of events so you don't miss out."}
{"text":"Meh. Came here for a conference and brought my wife and 5 year old.  Not the best place for them.  Okay for me.  I'm used to budget-type family hotels and not the corporate gig.  I have relatively high standards for my budget hotels though. This is certainly not a budget hotel Regardless, this place was a little underwhelming.  Pros -Secluded and peaceful -Trails to hike or run -Fitness center somewhere -Nice pools -Friendly staff -Spa and spacious conference facilities -Restaurant on site -Golf on site  Cons -Expensive -Far from anything -Endless hallways -Lots of doors that all look the same but some enter into conference rooms--surprise! -No complimentary breakfast -\"Go Green\" option means you'll have to ask for absolutely anything you use up to be replaced, i.e. coffee or cups or shampoo. So don't forget to ask for extra for extended says. -Must pay to use internet - in 2014? Really?  And it is spotty coverage at that! -Spotty cell phone coverage (AT&T) - again in 2014? -Somewhat dated decor -2-bed rooms have double beds not queen -locked mini fridge I assume for bar items, but it would be nice to be able to put personal stuff in there  We stayed one night in a budget hotel just up the road for our first night in town and liked it better for our needs."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Sheraton at Wild Horse Pass. The hotel is beautifully constructed; upon entering you are greeted with a floor-to-ceiling window facing the mountains and pool. I really liked how the hotel took an appreciation for the Native culture in the area and decorated the hotel throughout with imagery and other things relating to local tribes. This includes the rooms. The rooms were comfy. I really loved having a balcony (and good thing to note is that all the rooms have a balcony, not just the pricier ones!).   The staff and services here are very nice. Staff was always very kind and helpful. My boyfriend and I ordered room service twice (once at at almost 4am and then another time for breakfast). Both times the food came to our rooms quick. As is typical at any hotel, room service is a little pricey. Nonetheless it was good food. The potatoes that came with my breakfast were really tasty! I was also able to use the hotel shuttle which proved to be soo useful. We were at the hotel for an event at the Rawhide Center and the shuttle drove us there free of charge. The shuttle also takes guests to other fun spots such as the casino. Unfortunately I did not get a chance to try out some of the other stuff the hotel has to offer (such as the pool), but I feel as though it's safe to assume those things would be a treat as well.   I am not marking points off for this but will describe the one \"downside\" to the Sheraton, and that is its location. Personally, I loved that it was a bit secluded. But it is important to take note that the hotel is not very close to anything - meaning if you need to go to a convenience store, or just wanna have a meal outside of the hotel, you will need to use some sort of transport. There is nothing walking distance (unless you enjoy walking really, really far).   I would recommend the Sheraton to anyone wanting to enjoy the casino/Rawhide event or for someone who wants a little staycation. It's a nice spot!"}
{"text":"For Mother's Day weekend, my parents got a room here - a nice little \"stay-cation\".  While I didn't have a room, I did spend the whole day here with the family.  The staff here seems to be excellent, friendly and professional.  The pool area is awesome, lots of space, and plenty of lounge chairs to relax on.  Afternoon is shy on shade, a common problem in Arizona, but reason enough to abandon the pool for the inside.  The lobby is fantastic, huge windows with amazing views, a waterfall and a coffee shop and bar in caves.  The rooms are nicely appointed, and comfortable, with patios or balconies.  The whole Sheraton is non smoking, so all the rooms smell nice.  The bathroom had both a large tub and a huge walk in shower.  Sound didn't seem to carry into the rooms from the neighbors or the hallway.  And like all Sheratons, you have got to try the mandarin lotion!    They have a river that not only helps keep the are cooler in the summer, and boats that will take you to the golf course or Rawhide - little water taxis and great guides.   They have done a great job bringing the Gila River Indian Community history and tradition into a modern hotel, without being hokey. I'll be recommending the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Resort to anyone looking for a place to stay here in the Valley!"}
{"text":"Attended a conference here a few weeks ago.  I haven't stayed at a Sheraton family hotel in quite sometime but the words Resort and Spa were key.  I got here the first night, wanted to self park the car and I did.  Told there would be a shuttle to come by and pick me up but never saw one but when I did see one, I was already up the sidewalk and almost in the door.    Asked for the fee to use the fitness center $20 but that wasn't a problem because my room was all the way in Tempe.  Or at least that is what it felt like.  I was at THE very end of the hall so I had a nice enjoyable walk everyday.    The place is very secluded, has music playing in the hallways, nice restaurants inside and great service from the staff.  Great views and very quiet if you wanted to sit outside and enjoy yourself.    They do have a shuttle to the casino which was a nice bonus."}
{"text":"The resort itself was beautiful.  I am giving it a low rating because the service was terrible and the parking & room location was horrible.  We spent all day on the baseball fields only to come back to shower for dinner to find our room uncleaned.  I called down for towels & it took them n early 45 min to bring them.  We ended up being late for our dinner reservation & unshowered.  Our room service tray was left outside of our room for 2 full days before they ever come to pick it up.    The self parking lot was fine to park in however you had to walk through half the hotel, up an elevator, through the rest of the hotel to another elevator to reach our room.  Seems a bit crazy to me that you are not able to simply park, take an elevator to your floor and go to your room.    I will be in Tempe for Spring Training again, year after year but would never stay at this resort again."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Wild Horse Pass resort for a work conference in January.  The resort, and the surrounding area are beautiful.  I highly recommend watching the sunset from the main lobby/bar area.  The rooms were nice; spacious and modern, though there was nothing to differentiate them from any other Sheraton.  The staff was friendly and helpful.    My only negative comment about the resort, is that there is a $20 per day charge to use the fitness center.  I understand the up charge for the spa, but a basic gym?  I want to tack on a 4th star, however this place was missing that WOW factor. It really had the opportunity to impress me, and it just missed the boat."}
{"text":"We recently stayed at this resort March 16-17th. I absolutely fell in Love with the place. The service was great the pool and slide for the kids was fun. It's not far from the outlets and casino and they shuttle to the casino for free. I loved the Aji Spa! And the riverboat rides are a must try. A special touch was we were leaving to go to the outlets early and an Indian was on a horse along with 4 other horses and we asked about the horses and they do horseback rides for the kids as well! How neat is that? Definitely we are coming back for Easter!"}
{"text":"We decided to spend the night as we knew we wanted to enjoy the kayaks, SUP's and hydrobikes this past weekend.  The hotel is quite nice (not the nicest in the Valley, but respectable), the staff was very friendly and the amenities were great - love that they have the water rentals, nice spa with fitness classes and the walking trails on property.  The bed and room overall were quite comfortable and we truly enjoyed our short stay."}
{"text":"Great, beautiful resort.  We loved it.  The slide initially was not governed by any staff so groups of kids were going down together and piling up on each other- extremely dangerous and scary.  Our daughter and friend were pushed by other kids as a result.  Finally they sent staff over to supervise and was much more at ease.  The food was good too at Ko Sin.  The wifi was horrible- just sayin."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed here for two nights to celebrate our anniversary.  When we got to our room there was a half bottle of champagne and a plate of chocolate dipped strawberries waiting for us.  Great touch- only problem was the strawberries were rotten.  I loved the bathroom- it was spacious and had a nice deep tub and seperate glass shower.  It had a magnifying mirror and scale, heavy/quality doors and knobs.  Very lush.  We had a problem with the tv in our room.  It wasn't working properly and we would spend 5 minutes just trying to change the channel.  Someone was sent to our room to give us a new remote but it didn't help.   Our room was on the top floor (4th) and we had a great view of the stars at night.  Only problem was there was only one chair on our balcony so we had to call housekeeping to bring another one.  We spent all day Saturday laying out at the beautiful pool with live music.  Once we figured out that there are flags on the back of the chair and you put them up to get a waiters attention we had great service.  We drank delicous banana daquiris and root beer floats.  My husband ate chicken wings and I had a veggie burger (so so so yummy!) for lunch.  Later on I ordered a fruit salad that was rotten.  I guess they just don't have high quality fruit between the choc dip strawberries and the fruit salad?!  The first night we had dinner at Kai- FANTASTIC.  I will do a seperate review for it.  The second night we ate at Kosin.  I was very disappointed.  When we arrived for dinner on a Saturday night we were asked if we had reservations.  We did not.  We could not be seated unless we ate outside by the pool  We were fine with that- it actually was a lovely place to eat as it was very cool for a summer night in AZ.  When walked out there you could see that 2/3 of the restaurant was empty.  I thought it weird they didn't have enough staff to serve dinner to the people staying at the hotel since it was the only other dinner option for guests that didn't have reservations at Kai.  The food was expensive for the hotels casual restaurant.  I ordered a pasta that I was told was vegetarian.  It was actually made with chicken stock and hurt my stomach almost instantly.  I was unable to eat it.  The waiter took it back to the kitchen and still charged us for it!!!  Unbelievable!!!"}
{"text":"Alas at the end of a series of winding roads, just when you think you might have taken the wrong turn....the resort appears like an oasis amidst the desert. Do not be in a hurry....but I think that's the whole point isn't it? As I was slumbering here, all the way from Scottsdale for a conference, I did not get to use many of the amenities at the resort. But I did have a very memorable dinner at Kai. Every menu cover displayed a different tale of the Native Americans - each with a hand-painted pictorial or petroglyph telling a tale. Five courses of blissful journey to Happyland - can I just tell you that food with a story and journey makes all the difference! Service was impressive! My only grunt: As a courtesy, please place screaming children in a separate room from all adult diners. Kind of takes away from the whole Zen-like experience. But I will be back - the views of the golf course were very inviting. Hats off to whomever manicured the fairways - not a blade out of place."}
{"text":"I've stayed here several times this year, averaging five days per stay. It is a beautiful, remote location on O'oodham Reservation land surrounded by desert hiking trails, a golf course, mountains, a river with boat rides, working stable, Aji Spa, and the eponymous wild horses which are breathtaking to behold. From the moment you pull up to valet it is welcoming; they offer water whether you are coming or going, and Bell Staff is quick, friendly and full of suggestions.   The decor is Southwestern with Native American music playing in the Lobby; check in is easy, and they welcome you back after your first visit. They were also great about extending stays and late check outs. There are several pools, one with a water slide, great food and beverage service, and planned activities day and night (see flyer in room for 411) Beds, towels and linens are high quality, rooms are well appointed.   Hanyo Grill poolside is AOk for food and drink, Room Service is timely -within 30 minutes - and accommodating of special requests. Kai is world class dining, and absolutely worth a trip if you are even visiting the PHX area; locally sourced exquisite dishes (separate review) and stellar service.   We really enjoy staycationing here, it is tranquil, peaceful, and reserved. We were engaged at Kai in May, have been there four times this year, and I'm sure it will be an anniversary destination especially since I live in AZ now.   * excellent service from all staff *  ** world class dining at Kai **  *** Aji Spa, hiking trails & group activities available ***  **** peaceful environment: I had 0 AT&T coverage here and LOVED it! ****  ***** Sheraton rewards members are automatically upgraded *****"}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of walking through this hotel today and it is beautiful! My fiancée and I will schedule our stay in the next few months. What prompted us to visit the facilities is that we booked a horseback ride at KOI and we just happened to be curious about the hotel. The grounds are breath-taking, with  an indoor rock with water flowing from the front, to the scent that I just cannot get out of my mind to the friendly staff members, I cannot wait to give a more comprehensive review as a customer at the hotel."}
{"text":"Let's get one thing aired out first: I was here on business. I would not normally be able to afford such a nice place (much less without the generous discount given to conference attendants like myself). That said, if you can afford it, I highly recommend.  The hotel is amazing. The grounds are gorgeously serene, the rooms are clean and comfortable, and the staff are impressively helpful without feeling pushy.  Some of the nitty-gritty:  * It costs to use the gym, either on a daily pass or you can pay one sum for your full stay.  * There is only wired internet in the rooms, which also requires payment. If you still need internet access, there's free wifi in the lobby areas, or computers at no cost to guests. * Water supplied to the hotel comes from the nearby Gila River Indian Community state of the art water treatment plant, and it tastes FANTASTIC. Don't you dare buy bottled water while you're here. Fill up from the tap!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give it s 2.5 stars because I am having to write this in the middle of the night because of the following reasons. 1) the beds are WAY to small for payin' almost 300 bucks. Let me not forget how uncomfortable the beds are. WOW. My husband and I look forward to going to resorts just for the beds (this is why I can't sleep right now). Not to mentioned how rough the sheets are. I couldn't sleep in shorts. Also, with this price I would expect a great spacious room, a bathroom with a vanity not a stand alone sink AT LEAST, and awful bath set up. It's awkward getting in.  2) the walls are ridiculously thin. If it wasn't for my daughters white noise I would prob be able to sleep in this this place 3) l didn't know it was on the Indian reservation, the aesthetics and decor are not of my liking. In a way it's kinda depressing. I def regret staying here. I would have been happier at a motel I think giving all the nagative I have already experienced here.  Very annoying."}
{"text":"I booked this hotel with the hopes of a relaxing weekend by the four pools.  I booked through Perfect Escapes because of the free room upgrad and early check in.  When my boyfriend and I arrived at the hotel, we were told it would be 30-60 min before our room was ready.  Not a huge deal, so we had the bell desk hold our bags and decided to check out the pool area.  As soon as we walked outside we hear extremely loud jackhammering going on.  They were using jackhammers at what looked like two of the four pools.  It was so loud we could stand side by side and not hear each other and it stirred up so much dust it was hard to see.  We immediately asked inside how long it would be going on.  They then told us it would be going on the entire weekend until 4 p.m. each day.  There was no indication of construction on the resort website or perfect escapes. Disappointing after $45 cab ride to the resort and then another $45 cab ride to another resort after then paying to use the hotel internet to find another resort.  I go to the Phoenix area often and have staid at Camelback Inn, Hyatt Gainey Ranch and Hotel Indigo.  All were wonderful accomodations.  From the look of this hotel on several websites, it was quite beautiful and relaxing and very comparable to the other resorts in the area.  Unfortunately, I never even made it to the room due to the construction.  It was not the relaxing weekend I had planned for.  The construction should have been disclosed on all websites linked to the hotel."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! We spent 3 days here over the Thanksgiving holiday and also came for the first time back in May. Rooms are very comfortable and clean, room had terrace overlooking the pool and golf course which was very nice. We dined at Ko'sin restaurant there and although it was classy, it leaves something to be desired. Wine list was great. Food was ok, but could've been better. Not too flavorful. Staff has always been very helpful and polite both times we were there. Room service for breakfast was great! A little more pricy than other places we've visited but who cares? It's vacation! Hotel is a little secluded and is about a mile and a half away from Wild Horse Pass Casino and the Arizona Premium Outlets. One good thing is that they have a free shuttle to both so if you go to the casino for a night of drinking, they will be your designated driver!"}
{"text":"This resort is an absolute wonder. Pet friendly, beautiful, peaceful and very accommodating. I chose this resort as a respite and am so glad I did. I think the staff are somehow tuned in to the people that stay there. It felt as though they actually cared about the guests. For instance, I came back to my room after walking my dog and found a very nice hand written card and gift basket from the bellman, Mike Singleton, wishing me a wonderful stay. It was really what I needed. I almost wept. Then the next day, the night attendant, Bonnie brought a doggie gift bag for us and a very nice hand written note as well.   In addition, the view, food, bars, rooms and pool are above expectations. The beds are amazing and there is a light, calming scent pumped through the air in the main lobby that makes you want to stay, rest and rejuvenate.   Thank you Mike, Bonnie and Sheraton for a much needed recharge."}
{"text":"I love a good hotel.  I stay in about 20 a year, and this is in my top five.  First, let me say I would only stay here with my kids as the rooms are only OK.  It's a Sheraton branded property, which is part of the Starwood program (always stick with your loyalty program).  But there is the slide.. Sorry not yet.  The architecture is that Santa Fe look with cactus and a  casino nearby (the hotel is on a reservation).  It is a maze of rooms and you could be walking really far to your room.  and there is the slide... oh not yet.  Finally, there is the resort charge.  Generally I don't stay in hotels with a resort charge as I'm on business and don't get to use the facilities.  On this trip I was with the family and we spent a bunch of time in the pool.  I think my kids will always like phoenix because of the pools.  They are amazing.  Which brings me to the slide (a water slide to be exact).  About 20 feet high, a tight corkscrew that is faster than I care to go (although I rode it about 20 times over an afternoon).   The best part is your going down it with a million kids.  It's like a conga line of death at (what seems like) 50 miles an hour.  It is great.  Go off season as I would feel like a chump paying full rack to go here.  Bring the kids.  Have fun."}
{"text":"This is an inexpensive resort and you truly get what you paid for.   The grounds are nice, the rooms are so-so. I paid $179 during high season and figured there's a reason in cheaper than the Courtyard, though it's considered a \"Resort\".  On the positive side the grounds are nice and the parking was free."}
{"text":"This resort would have 0 stars if that was an option.  Staff are incompetent and frankly, they are criminals.  I will be filing a police report and formal complaint with the proper authorities.  The hotel  looks nice, but everyone who works here is unfriendly and pathetic.  Beware: if you charge anything to your room, like room service, they will place a hold on your credit card, without ever informing you, for almost NINE times the amount of your purchase.  I had room service at one point and also in-dining restaurant charges totaling $300 for their overpriced bland food and some of it downright nasty, *****and this so-called hotel placed $2,600 of my money on hold.****  You read that right.  I was told it would be released when I checked out, although I had also prepaid my room up to a week. Paid for in full.  Only $300 charged but $2600 held on my credit card.  Of course, I pitched a fit and had to deal with incompetent managers Taylor and Austin.  They are the worst, most stupid, arrogant people I've met here.    Further, and I suspect this was retaliation because I complained, security entered my room without permission and rummaged through my things after I asked for a tech to fix TV, FOR THE THIRD TIME.  I asked why they went through my personal items and  was told \"there was a complaint of smoking on my floor.\"    What?! You better believe I will be  suing this place.  First of all, I do not smoke. Never have.  Secondly, my room was so far away from civilization, I had no neighbors during my entire stay and had to walk almost a mile to and from my room.   Bogus bullshit.  Austin and Taylor could not adequately explain why my room and my belongings had been violated.  Yet, they held an additional $1,200 on my credit card for no apparent reason.  I suspect again it was retaliatory, just because they could do it.  They could not explain the reason for holding this amount of my funds. After pitching a fit again and not having any competent management to turn to, they released the $1200 yet my bank couldn't remove it from pending status for more than 5 days, leaving me without access to almost 4K while I stayed here (and is why I didn't just pack up and leave), since there was already over $2600 they placed on hold as well.  And if you don't mind the misappropriating of Native American culture by pretending to respect the history of this area, you'll love it here! (NOT!)  Clearly, I had a difficult time with this situation.  And given that I stay at many hotels throughout the world using this same debit card but have never encountered these holds, I question Sheraton's practices and will probably never stay in a Sheraton again.  However, let me thank Cedric, manager on NYE, whom I called and he very diligently followed up, made sure holds were removed, explained intelligently what the their reasoning was although again, Sheraton's practices are not reasonable, removed a smoking fee I did not deserve, and he called me back with a helpful message and compassion.  Thank you Cedric for being the perfect professional in this situation.  I now bump my stars up to 2, just because of Cedric and to acknowledge it is a pretty property and while the spirit of the place could use some work, the waiters at the pool were the best with a spirit of joy in their hearts.  Thanks again Cedric and happy New Year to YOU!"}
{"text":"We stayed for a week over Easter this year. Cannot complain at all. Very friendly service, great pool area, nice and clean rooms. Ok, we got the rooms towards the parking lot  but that's of course what you get if book lowest price through a travel portal. The restaurant are higher price, ok, we expected that, we went once to the family restaurant. food was ok for the price. Anyway: It was a great relaxing stay, and we may comeback if we are in the area again."}
{"text":"This is an INCREDIBLE hotel. Starting with Brian in valet, he was so helpful and welcoming. Margaret at the front desk helped my mom, and was so wonderful. Our room overlooking the pool was so clean, spacious and beautifully decorated. The pool is great for kids and adults. There is a waterslide great for all ages!!! It really is a wonderful hotel overlooking a beautiful golf course. We will 100% be back!!!"}
{"text":"Kinda torn on this place as it has some very nice qualities.  Specifically the property itself.  It feels isolated although it's pretty much south Phoenix metro.  Left my patio door open and heard coyotes at night a great sound for a Colorado kid from back when Colorado was rural state...great pools for families and of course Golf looks great.  Although the golf was way out of my price point at $180 as I had to rent clubs.  I also Had a beautiful sunset view out my room as well very nice!   The bad, rooms are fair and the walls ridiculously thin.  You can hear everything. I hate that. The food service staff is not the best chasing you out of an empty restaurant for a dress code violation is stooopid. Also the food is horrible bland and uncreative.  The drinks are also overpriced but they've got you as there is nothing else around.    If the hotel of California was thing, this would be the Arizona version...,"}
{"text":"Second time here, first was a magical stay, this time NOT so much! Checked in and checked our room out, BATCAVE. I DON'T think so. Next room, will have to do! For $200 to $300 a night I expect a lot more. Grounds and Hotel are pretty awesome, visually that is. Rooms, eh, OK at best. You can hear other guest from your room, WTF. Bring lots of money with you, you're trapped out in the middle of nowhere and they have you by the short ones. The rooms I requested could not be had cause a football team was here last minute! Last time for Sheratons for us! Funny, last time we stayed here we saw wild horses in the distance from our room. This time just golfers every where, would like to have seen wild horses again but I guess they are history, too bad!"}
{"text":"already seriously annoyed.  it is Friday night 6 PM Labor Day weekend there is one person behind the counter here.  person that appears to be in the manager appears to be off in the corner just talking to someone watching this go by.  there currently nine people in line.  is someone doing drugs?"}
{"text":"Pretty clean place to stop at for a pretty fair price.  It was a little smaller than I had originally hoped but it was very quiet.  Amenities were nice and the scenery was beautiful.    They allow smoking at their casino (on tribal grounds) and that was a negative experience for me.  A decent poker room with a few spread games.  Overall, a nice pit stop for anytime I am driving through the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Great pool. Rooms adequate. Bar service extremely lacking!  Not a place I will return to since they are really not at all concerned with customer service.  Overall the place was lack-lustre."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Went for a stay-cation with the girls for a spa day and stayed the night.  I can't wait to go back!  You are in the city but feels miles away!  The spa is amazing!  Wonderful adults only pool with great refreshing food and drinks.  Then our rooms were clean and comfortable.  Dinner at Kai was nothing short of superb, and breakfast the next morning on the patio over looking the golf course and pool area was also very good.  Overall a wonderful night away."}
{"text":"Stayed here a number of times while on business. Very pleasant hotel and staff are friendly. There is a frequent bus service to the casino which is good. the pool is very relaxing with a great view for sunsets which are awesome in AZ.  Any issue I have had here was resolved very quickly."}
{"text":"What can I say...I was here for 5 nights on a business trip and fell in love the first time. I returned again and was not disappointed. Awesome Gym and very clean and large rooms, great food as well. Great gambling too.  Well worth $400 per night. They also have rooms for lower price as well. give them a try. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Updated review:  Hanyo poolside service is just awful. There is no other way to put it. The bartenders, the waiters, the towel boys are all lazy, uncaring, and neglectful. I think it is a complete joke that gratuity is added to all tickets when it's like pulling teeth to get any service. The first waiter was slow.  Then he \"forgot\" to bring me my change from my bill. I had to ask the new waiter for him to bring me my change. That made me feel awkward, and like I was being the rude one. Then the new waiter completely ignored us, even when I put an entire row of flags up to get his attention. I went to the bar, ordered a drink, drank the entire contents, used the restroom, all while the flags were up and ignored. The area was not crowded. I took that time to go up to the front desk and complain. Time out from my vacation. Time away from relaxing. My husband works 80 hours a week, I run a small business, and we can't even go to an \"upscale\" resort and be served a drink. At that point I decided that I didn't care to spend any more of my hard earned money at the pool.    The shuttle should have an expected schedule. The idea of it is nice. Waiting 45 minutes for it, and having the casino valet call the driver twice, apologizing to us for what is not his mistake, is not nice. And God forbid that the driver be pleasant. The first one was talking on her cell phone to her kids the entire way. Does that seem safe? Apparently she is following the criteria to work for Sheraton. I'm seeing a pattern here.   My husband ordered room service around 6:30pm. The food was good. But I did not appreciate coming back to the room at 11:30pm to see the plates still sitting there on the floor. To me that just screams, \"roach attack\"! But what should I expect when our room had very obviously been half heartedly cleaned? The sheets and comforter weren't even on straight when we arrived.   The icing on top of the cake was the fire alarm situation. That really should have been handled in a more professional manner. I expect to have something like that told to me when I'm booking my reservation, or at the very least at check in. The front desk informed me that they did not receive the information until 6pm the previous night. What would have been acceptable (if that is even true) would be to leave a recorded message on all the room's telephones. If I would not have left the room at 9:15am to get a newspaper I would have never seen the notice that was at the front of my door. I would have been inappropriately scared at that point. We rushed to check out just to avoid the screeches. Yet again, no relaxation to be had at The Sheraton at Wildhorse Pass!   When checking out I saw an error on my printed receipt. The Hanyo Grill had charged us for a bill that we did not owe. We paid for every single item in cash. Another way to get extra money and extra gratuity out of us it seems. Disgraceful. Luckily, the clerk promptly took it off our bill. Let's see if it shows up on our bank statement. As you can see, I have no trust or faith in your institution. After 3 years in a row of stays at your hotel, I can confidently say that we will never return to your property.   I was supposed to have the manager call me today to discuss these issues. Would you be surprised to find out that my phone hasn't rung?!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Pet friendly with no pet fee! They put you on the first floor so you can walk your dog right out of your sliding glass door that gives you easy access to the resort's beautiful grounds.   Only one complaint, and it's just about the restaurant servers. When you ask for a straw, they start in with the poor turtles and go into this straw-shaming rhetoric such that by the end of your stay, you just want to gulp down your water without a straw because you just don't want to experience the buzz-kill that happens every time you dare to ask for that straw! I sympathize with the turtles (straws seem to end up in their noses somehow), but it's a broken record with the severs. But this is just a minor peccadillo because this is a fabulous resort! I highly recommend it! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Rooms are noisy. The first room I shared a door that was locked with someone and I can hear everything next door. There was also a constant sound coming from somewhere the second morning. I asked for a quiet room and they only had double beds but i moved rooms. The second room every morning at 6am i woke up to someone doing roof work with a hammer and i think a drill right above my bathroom at both mornings. Our company paid a lot of money to come this show in this hotel and this is the rest i dont deserve. As i am writing this, i still hear sounds on the roof. Also the entire look of this hotel is not 4 star level. Im disappointed with Sheraton."}
{"text":"This is a very well organized hotel and it feels cozy and homy. We hosted a huge event here and they handled it amazingly. I find it useful to point out that the plumbing is absolutely top notch. The rooms are quite nice but felt a little bit small for the high rates. I was very impressed at how well they handled the 1000+ guest influx from my event.   The hotel has a well decorated lobby with paintings of the indigenous population of the area. The large rentable spaces were well kept and had very nice acoustics and lighting for performances. The price was high as they quoted but came down on price as soon as we bargained.  The decorations, while looking nice, actually ended up feeling cheap after looking closer, I felt it was quite lazy. Another thing I wasn't impressed with was the utility of the furnishings in the rooms. The rooms had no microwave or fridge(the most useful thing was the bathroom sink). Even the bed was uncomfortable!  Overall, great for weddings and events of the sort, but would not recommend for a stay visiting from a different country."}
{"text":"We stayed five nights.  The room was wonderful, the bed was the most comfortable we've ever slept in, staff was friendly and attentive.  Great pool and poolside bar and restaurant.  Only downside was it was Father's Day weekend and the pool was filled with toddlers.  Very unappealing; but they all went home Monday and the rest of the week was great.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The resort is beautiful but not well maintained. The carpet in the room was stained and there was something smeared on the side of my toilet, which would also not flush unless you held the handle down. The biggest issue is that there was no way to buy water, snacks, cigarettes, etc. after 8pm. You would have to sit at the bar and order or take a 2 mile shuttle to a casino down the road. I've been to plenty of very nice resorts and it's the small things that set the best apart from the crowd, and this resort just didn't have it."}
{"text":"Very nice resort. I love the Native American theme throughout. Everything is in really good shape. It's nice and quiet and beautiful desert views. If they had free public wifi, that would be great, but they don't. During the summer they always have the AC down so low in the place and it's cold all the time!"}
{"text":"I stayed at this spot for a week and had some mixed feelings about it by the time I left.   First, I'll start with the good: it's on an Indian reservation in a secluded area, has a great pool, a beautiful atrium seating area and a friendly staff. Even though the resort was out of the way, it was still only a five minute drive to an outlet mall and several restaurants, which I appreciated.  However, for the price point there was definitely some room for improvement. First of all, the cleanliness of the room was not where I would have expected it to be in a place of this level. The walls were extremely thin and I could hear every single word the people in the rooms on either side of min said, which was less than great, especially since I wanted to go to bed early one night. There was constant Indian flute music playing 24/7 which got a bit old after a while. The food here could really use an improvement as well, especially for medium sized groups.   I'm glad I got a chance to stay here and experience this side of Arizona, but if I were to come back to this area, I would like try a different hotel before coming back to this one."}
{"text":"Reasons to love the resort & spa:  + Huge, beautiful outdoor pool (maybe 70 degrees), including a couple hot tubs and a waterslide!  + Several on-site dining options (Kai, Ko'Sin, pool-side bar, and coffee bar)  + Lounging in the lobby section with a view, includes a bar, many seats, indoor/outdoor fireplaces, streams, and chess/checkers tables  + Super short drive from PHX (25 min)  + Off the beaten path  + Rooms with balconies and views of the western sky (sunset, anyone??)  + Got a deal on JetBlue Getaways  + Access to a golf course, 2.5 mile walking/jogging dirt trail, and beautiful spa  + Friendly staff  + Very nice atmosphere with updated amenities  + Local Native American art is featured throughout the resort  Reasons to kinda sorta hate the resort:  + There is 1 elevator in the main lobby  + Confusing layout and very LONG walks from one end to to the lobby  + Half the rooms don't get the sunset views  + Use of the gym is an additional $20 fee and located in the spa (a separate building, but within walking distance)  + The lobby is one the 3rd floor, but the pool is the 1st floor (obviously), but access to the pool is not so obvious...  + You can get into the building at multiple points, but if you don't want to walk back to the lobby elevator, you'll have to take the emergency stairs, which aren't so inviting or easy to find  + Staff seems limited..?  Like if you request something, it takes a while...  + Parking is not convenient for bringing luggage up to your room.  But neither is the elevator lobby...  More details? I enjoyed our stay.  It was a babymoon and the staff really took to it.  They delivered a complimentary slice of million-layer chocolate chocolate cake (I made that name up), which was delicious; we upgraded our room for $20 per night from standard to \"preferred,\" which gave us a king bed and a beautiful view of the western sky (worth it); and possibly a larger bathroom with separate shower and soaker tub.  It's too bad there is no sink outside the bathroom..  Also, I wish the light on the balcony could turn off so we could keep the doors open and un-shaded for full listening pleasure of the wildlife (coyotes and birds mainly).  I would have liked to stay more days to enjoy the resort some more, but the restaurants are a bit on the pricey side and breakfast was not included.  We ate at Ko'Sin for breakfast a couple times, though, and the food is good.  Definitely see my review of Kai separately.  Same goes for Aji Spa."}
{"text":"Stephen G. hit the nail on the head - \"You buy a peaceful experience\". I was looking for a resort/spa but also wanted to take advantage of horseback riding as much as I could. This resort definitely exceeded my expectations - the staff is AMAZING (friendly, accommodating, etc), the food was delicious, the resort is beautiful and the rooms were also clean and well-maintained. Everyone I encountered went the extra mile with regard to service. I came back to NYC completely rejuvenated."}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough to visit this hotel on a site visit and I have nothing but great things to say. The hotel is beautiful and the staff was so responsive and just great all around. The golf course was immaculate and really just a fun place to stay for a weekend. You are minutes from the casino and multiple downtown areas with great food options.  In the middle of the night the fire alarm went off 3-4 times and they gave everyone a credit to have lunch or do whatever up to 50 dollars on them. It really impressed me. I'm very much looking forward to coming back to this resort !"}
{"text":"Beautiful place. Great accommodations,  beautiful surroundings.  Food is great, pool was wonderful.  Just wish I had a chance to golf here.  Also,  every staff member i interacted with was very kind, friendly and accommodating.  Thank you much."}
{"text":"This place used to be a hidden gem, now something is definitely missing.  This week we had out of town family visiting from California. Being Starwood preferred members and fans of the Wild Horse Pass area from a stay almost 6 years ago, they planned a 5 nights stay. I also got a room for one of the nights to have a mini staycation for my birthday.  5 stars for the resort grounds and view. Watching the sunset over the mountains through the two story floor to ceiling windows in the lobby is an experience. Even being a local used to the AZ sunset, it's a sight to see.   4 stars for self parking not being convenient, the rooms being cramped and the pool area. The kids loved the pool complex with two shallow play pools(one with zero water line that is amazing for half submerged tanning and little ones), the water slide was surprisingly fun for young and old alike, and the \"adult\" pool has some great poolside fountains that are toddler friendly as well. As you can tell, the pool caters to families, it happens. If you want a true adult only pool stay somewhere with a bigger pool complex. Very comfortable lounge chairs and the pool bar staff were prompt and personable. The kids didn't seem to mind that the pool was warm but the adults might need some cool drinks to deal with the heat. The margaritas were nasty(unforgivable in AZ, especially on national tequila day) but the blood orange mojito was so refreshing. Be aware that the bottom of the pool is in dire need of resurfacing, it is a gritty plaster that will tear up your feet and knees if you aren't careful(but great if you desperately need a pedicure).  3 stars for service. The whole week it was pretty hit or miss. Valet service and front desk was very attentive. Restaurant and bar service was great. Any staff you pass will look up and greet you. Pool got iffy as there was only ever one pool attendant for the entire pool and it could take awhile to get service, especially around shift changes in the afternoon. Extra activities like the \"boat\" rides, you better plan ahead and make sure they know you're coming because apparently they pack up early without letting anyone know. That made for some disappointed kiddos and no one seemed to want to take responsibility for it.The spa needs some scheduling tips as well. We also were brought a piece of chocolate cake(I'm assuming for my birthday?) however it was just left in the room at 10 AM while we were out, without a note, and it was in my family's room not mine so who knows for sure. Um, thanks?  What brought it down to 2 stars was cleanliness. The resort is showing signs of neglect in this area. Cleaning crew apparently leave at 11 AM every day so if you don't request room cleaning by 9 AM you don't get it. Seemed more like a condo complex then a resort on that point. Room service trays sat in the hallway for most of the day. Cobwebs all over outside windows, bird droppings in the pool area, and stained carpet and ceiling tiles.  But the clincher was the experience we had with my room. As we were preparing for bed, I was drawing the curtains closed and happened to look up at the valance. The corner was covered in spider webs and 5-6 live spiders! Albeit daddy long legs which are less scary then most spiders out here but still not roommates I appreciate. I then noticed more webs in the opposite corner of the room and another huge (alive) daddy long legs, this corner being almost directly above the bed. This would have been instant grounds to move rooms for me however we were given the room directly next to my family, it was already 1 AM, and a conference had just checked in so we were doubtful of getting another room. Armed with a can of hairspray we killed as many bugs as we could find and slept with a light on the rest of the night. It doesn't matter how amazing that heavenly bed is when you feel like you're going to have bugs on your face all night. I just don't understand how a cleaning crew misses something like that. I was going to let the front desk know but as I was checking out the next day over the phone, she cut me off before I had a chance to and hung up. Let's hope someone actually reads their questionnaires.   There are so many amazing hotel and resort options in the Phoenix area, at great prices too during the summer. Unless they train their cleaning crew better, it's going to hurt their popularity."}
{"text":"Old and smelly. Service was non existent until our group leadership complained that bar service (only one lobby bar)was 45 minutes to get beverages. Now let's talk about the bed. So uncomfortable I need to see the chiropractor. The rooms have that over used look. Lots of dents and damage to all furniture. The water pressure is inconsistent. The sink drain gurgles all the time. Very disturbing for sleep. Towels are given out as if they are a precious commodity. No housecoat in the room. Had to ask.  No refrigerator and bar in room but there is a space where it can be located. For the price it's is not worth it.  Rawhide- what a joke. It's was embarrassing for our group. Food BBQ was poor to average.  The \"show\" was bad.  Golf - courses are friendly yet challenging. Except there was high winds to the point of a sand white out. Had to stop early Will not return"}
{"text":"To us this place was OK. It is a nice quick staycation spot that is close to home. The rooms are clean and the pool area is nice. Its pretty fancy and the price to us anyways was pretty fancy. You have to check on deal sites because sometimes they have some awesome specials available on there."}
{"text":"Ouch three months after my review I had an extra $300 in mystery charges that the hotel can't explain. Wtf!!!  Consider my updated review a 1 star for charging me for the guest after me.   This property  sure has some pretty views! Flew in for a conference and  they really didn't disappoint on meeting setup, assistance and logistics.  The rooms, however left a little to be desired. In my room, the toilet handle was falling off, outlets were cracked and falling off, and it was overall showing wear and tear.  The staff was helpful if not a little confused trying to track down packages they signed for. All in all, maybe they were still frazzled after the Super Bowl."}
{"text":"I stayed here with my 67-pound dog during the 2016 BlogPaws Conference. The staff was accommodating and welcoming to the variety of 4-legged friends - from rats to big dogs. There were water bowls, treats, and toys in the lobby and they allowed the conference to set up pet water fountains and treat bowls in the convention center. We were here in June and it was 110+ each day. The hotel put out a runner rug between the door and the \"pet restroom\" grass area and set up a mister fan to help keep everyone cool.   Our room was quite comfortable - bed, desk, armchair (that my dog commandeered), chest of drawers so I could really unpack for the 4 days we were there, and nice balcony. My dog is on medication that has to be refrigerated so the staff brought a mini-fridge to the room for her - no extra charge. There was plenty of room to set up my dog's bed and bowls. The only thing I would have changed in the room was the height of the desk chair - a little too low for a short person.   I ate mostly buffet food at the conference and it was delicious - I appreciated the many options for vegetarian and gluten-free eaters and how well all the food was labeled with allergen information. These little touches made a big difference. And a bonus hat tip to the staff of the coffee kiosk - they were always super friendly and kind.  The grounds were lovely. The hotel is away from the city so we can enjoy the sights and sounds of nature. I would have preferred that the road leading to the hotel had a paved sidewalk or jogging path. There's a lovely nature trail, but I'm not a fan of trail running.  Full disclosure: As a speaker at this conference, the BlogPaws staff paid for my room, so I have no idea what the price was. The fact that my room was comped to me does not impact my opinion of my experience here."}
{"text":"Stayed here again for New Year's Eve. Such a good time. Great room with an awesome view. The bar had a great duet singing. Champagne toast at midnight. Staff were friendly. One of the managers ran and got our car as the valet guys were busy. (Above & beyond) Highly recomend."}
{"text":"WOW. I was here for a wedding this past Saturday night and and let me tell you it was very nice. The wedding ceremony was small and was held outside in a cute area that was quite hard to find but the staff were very helpful and friendly for someone that was very lost.   After the ceremony, we walked over to our private area for the cocktail hour before the dinner. Again another nice area and it was the perfect size for this very small and very cozy wedding. The dinner was buffet style and was very good. My favorite dish were these steak medallions with risotto. I actually went back for a little more because it was so good. YUM! Needless to say I had a great time at the wedding and the Sheraton Wild Horse really did a great job making my friends day extra special!"}
{"text":"We booked a room couple weeks in advance and when we arrived a bit after 11pm the music in the lobby was so LOUD that it was uncomfortable. Then the night manager told us the room we booked was unavailable and gave us a standard room allllllll the way in the rear of the resort. He did not accommodate. We were very upset. Then the room is linked to the next doors room with a door access so we can hear them partying and had to sleep with the tv on!   Overall the place was ok. Valet awesome, Bell man GREAT, price for room ok, Bed was comfortable, bathroom was nice, cool balcony. There's shuttle service to the casino which was nice. 2 stars."}
{"text":"I'm really 50/50 on this place.  The price for rooms during the off season are really reasonable and they have a beautiful pool with a water slide that overlooks the pristine golf course.  Even the basic rooms are really nice with wood floors when you walk and incredibly comfortable beds.  I think this is the first resort I've ever stayed where they have body pillows!  The grounds are beautiful and immaculately landscaped.    But as you know, with the good there usually is the bad too, and there were certainly bad parts of the resort.  The service at the pool was so slow and they were not busy.  We would raise our chair flag and see 5-10 pool employees at any given time just standing around chatting with each other.  The pool ran out of towels and it took them almost an hour to bring down others.  EVERYTHING is overpriced here and I simply don't like being taken advantage of just because they can.  A can of dos xx was $8 before tip, margaritas started at $11 and went up from there.  After looking at the menus for the restaurants at the resort we opted to drive to a nearby restaurant and save hundreds of dollars.  I'm not sure why this place charges 5 star prices when it's not a 5 star hotel."}
{"text":"I give this place three stars...  Don't get me wrong... it's a beautiful place.  Awesome Native American atmosphere... well appointed decore.. nice staff.  It's cray-cray far from anywhere you want to be... but I guess that was expected if you want to 'really' get a way from civilization.  My room was literally south Tucson.  The furthest from the conference center... with no to little wifi.. which sucks.  My room was clean... nice.. bed and pillows were comfy... but.. I could hear the guests next to me talking.. their music.. and midnight groaning....slapping and all sorts of funny animals noises.. not what I would call comforting.  Would I stay again... maybe."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this relaxing hotel. We enjoyed the pool, walking the nature paths in the evening, and the gym with pilates machine. I look forward to a boat ride on my next visit. The staff was friendly and the drinks were delicious. In the spa gift shop were many great skincare items and unique gifts, lotions, ect. I also look forward to using the Aji Spa on my next visit."}
{"text":"A very relaxing and cozy resort for the family. Beautiful views and great amenities- bar downstairs opens at night, lots of pools and water activities, and a bar grill outside.  Excellent customer service, grear staff. There is a gift shop downstairs. A real negative is that the market in the lobby closes at 8 pm. Real disaster if you need something after 8.  Also, ideally located close to the outlets and the casino."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful place. My husband and I stay here once a year.  This year our experience was not that great. Upon arriving to our room, we noticed it had not been vacuumed and was very dusty. Food crumbs were on the dresser.  We called the front desk and they sent housekeeping right up. The beds are comfortable but the linens are horrible and worn. The pillows are old and lumpy. House keeping does not know how to make a bed. We had to remake the bed each night. It was a mess. On our third day, we left our room at 11am and headed for the pool. We returned to our room at 6pm hoping to shower and change for dinner. We entered our room and discovered it had not been cleaned. So disappointing to return to a dirty room. No clean towels to shower. Called front desk. They apologized, said they had been busy. Asked us to give them an hour. So we did not shower from being at pool all day and changed clothes. We then headed to our dinner reservations. I went to take a bath after dinner and discovered toe nail clippings in the tub. Disgusting. This is not a cheap hotel. They charge a resort fee and nickel and dime you for everything. The pool service was wonderful. The drinks were amazing. We enjoyed the pool each day. We will not stay here again. The rooms are dirty and in desperate need of a remodel."}
{"text":"I don't have a lot of experience with resorts for families, but if they are all like this I'll be happy! The staff was very helpful and friendly. We enjoyed the pools and water slide. We were there during spring break, but it never felt too busy.  I especially loved the small \"baby pool\" by the water slide. Our 2 yr old could stand in it and splash around. It was nice to let him lose and not worry about him wandering to the deep end or walking off steps into deep water.  Typically we have to constantly holds him which is frustrating for both of us parents. This was such a nice treat...to sit in the water while he played.  Our 8 yr old loved the games the staff organized at the top of every hour. Our 5 year old eventually worked up the courage to join her sister on the water slide and they didn't want to ever leave.  We all loved listening to flute music and s'mores by the  fire on Friday night.  I'm sad our stay was so short and that I didn't have time to try out the kid's club or the spa or the restaurants.  The website said there were free yoga and meditation classes on the weekends, but I couldn't find anything more about when and what the classes were exactly. I could have called, but was hoping to sign up online since I read about this in the wee hours of the last morning we were there and didn't want to wake the kids with a call.  Both my husband and I took turns running outside. I just did the out and back on the \"interpretive trail\" which was beautiful and a perfect 3 mile run from the pool and back. My husband ran 5 miles so he took a few more trails by the golf course and almost got lost.  The bathroom in our room was large. Nice tub and shower. Beds were super comfy. I just wish there was more space on the balcony. Clean rooms and more updated than I expected.  We checked out today and noticed an extra 50ish $ charge in addition to the resort fee so we'll be checking that out.  Overall, great experience. Hoping to come back."}
{"text":"Beautiful location. We bought on Hotwire for a great summer rate. There was a reasonable resort fee ($25) that covered the amenities. The rooms were clean and upgraded, with a nice separated standing shower and bathtub. The pool area was clean and beautiful, and has a great view of desert and mountain. Very beautiful.   My only gripe (and the reason I'm docking one star) is because even though there was very low occupancy, we were placed in a 1st floor room with a breathtaking view of the parking lot. It feels like we really missed out on the view the resort had to offer because of the crummy view.   Next time we check in we will confirm at the front desk that our room has some type of view."}
{"text":"Accommodations were fantastic. We had a group dinner at the restaurant on site and it was excellent - highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is the worst Shearton and resort ever. If you want to be accused of and discriminated because of your gender, color, or ethnicity go here. Front desk manager Emily accused our party of smoking medical Marijuana because of our gender and race. Really??? Front staff needs customer service skills. The director Aaron speaks well, but his priority is his company first not the consumers who pays his bills. Ruined honeymoon due to a faulty alarm system, by the way when was the last time it was calibrated. Hmm awaken by 3 body guards and threaten to get kicked out. No smoking or vape just a candle as it was our honeymoon. Billed 250 because a faulty alarm went off. If you stay here beware, ask to see proof of the maintenance done on the system as they do become outdated and need to be cleaned. Check your credit card statement and dispute all charges you are disagree with. They are still holding money and it's been 11 days and the room was paid in full prior to arrival. They are liars!! They promised a fee would not be charged due to the candle and then I guess due to low cenus they pick on guest and charge them bogus charges. To all my staff, check your emails we will have the last 10 conferences to their competitors. I thought Shearton was a great place. What a joke!"}
{"text":"Recently stayed at this resort for a staycation and have to say it was a very comfortable stay. Rooms are nice and clean, staff is all very friendly and helpful and the beds are very comfortable. The resort is well kept and the pool area is nice.   For the price per night, the resort should at the very least offer a FREE continental breakfast in the morning. We were told that we could not bring in any food or drink into the pool area as long as the restaurant/bar area is open for business. And it is open for business until about 8pm. The resort also charges an EXTRA $20 per night fee for internet, computer and gym use and it is NOT optional!! I think you should be able to opt out of this fee and you cant!  Also didn't like that the parking lot was SOOO far away from the resort. For elderly people or for anyone in the summer this can be killer walking to and from your car.  Overall the stay was great but just expected more for the amount of money you spend to stay here."}
{"text":"Well, not sure where to begin. I rarely ever write reviews, but I'm disappointed. First of all, be aware of your charges with this resort. They tend to charge for every little thing without any good reason.  Also I am very disappointed with this resort's cleanliness of the rooms, and hallways.  For two nights we never got any room service/cleaning , no bell man around, no valet service. The excuse was that it was during a shift change ! Hmmm so why is there a resort fee? Management was not helpful. I suggest other alternatives for your stay, perhaps in Scottsdale if you would like a relaxing and memorable vacay."}
{"text":"The Sheraton is located in the Gila River native american territory. It is a beautiful hotel with a breathtaking native american artwork theme. The colors of the building and the landscape make the hotel blends perfectly with the desert and mountains.  They are three large pools, three hot tubs, and a slide. The pools are resort style and shallow. Do not expect to do laps. Sunbathing and relaxing by the pool is perfect.  The ceiling in the lobby has beautiful native american artwork. The hotel has a relax feel.  The hotel provides great options to eat. From the bar by the pool that serves bar food to Kai that serves high end native american gourmet cuisine. Ko'sin is less expensive but serves great good and drinks. See my review.  The rooms are large wih a bath tub and a shower. Both sides the view is great. If you want to go to the spa ask for a room in the Puma wing. The aji spa is $20 for hotel guest.  The gym is inside the spa. For runner a 2.5-mile trail ( round trip) brings you along the Gila river. Go in the morning to avoid the heat. Continuing on the trail will lead you to the Casino! Parking is free. No wifi in the hotel! It was a surprise. The staff has the front desk and in the restaurants was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I brought the family out for a fun weekend prior to a conference that I was attending at this hotel the following week.  A great hotel for the kids with plenty of places to walk and lots to do.    The girls loved the relay races and cannonball contests in the pool and the watermelon eating contest and of course swimming and the water slide.    We didn't have a car so we didn't venture off property.  Eating on the property and going to Rawhide (old western town brought back to life; very fun, but clearly a tourist trap) were nice (the food was good), but rather expensive.  It was a vacation though and eating on resort is always going to be expensive.  One of my daughters has food allergies and the staff was usually very accommodating allowing her to substitute something in her meal for something that she wasn't allergic to without additional charge.  Once we were charged several dollars extra for having to substitute fruit for something else and unfortunately they made only a VERY vain effort to try and remediate the situation.  I expected better from that experience, but that was a one-off in what was otherwise a very fun, very relaxing weekend."}
{"text":"The Sheraton is about a mile or so pass the casino. When you get to the end of the street the road that takes you to the hotel almost looks like it's someones driveway but as soon as you across over and drive up towards the hotel its about a mile or so (so it seems) before you arrive at the hotel. The hotel is very big, conference room all sorts of meeting rooms, quute a few lounges and bars inside and outside. The fire place was goung outsude too. There is a wedding section outside for those that want to get married on the fake green grass ( i believe its fake bit saw sprinkle embedded). If you dont like walking ask for a few close or near the elevator if not you may end up way in the back. If you have ever stayed at the Gaylor you will know what I'm talking about. The room was descent but I've  een in bigger but i did not have any complaints. I walked around the entire compound which was about 2500 steps. All i. All it nice. All  Native American designs. Very nice bed was comfortable and sheets were clean. There is a restaurant inside hotel. If you don't valet park there is a good walking distance from. Parking lot to hotel. Golfing is at the location also. The premium outlet is less than 5 min away."}
{"text":"Gorgeous hotel! I was here for a conference and the staff at the hotel really took care of us.   The views alone are 5 stars. Simply magnificent.  Don't worry my little yelpers, I'll attach pics :) As I'm from the chilly Midwest I took every opportunity to relax outside and enjoy the sunshine and clear skies.  My room was awesome. Being Starwood preferred has its perks. Private balcony with a view of the pool and golf course was great.   The only issue I have is the food. Not really that good. I stayed at this hotel for a week. I had a chance to sample pretty much every food concoction their chef could come up with. Every meat dish I had was not seasoned. Zero flavor. Even their carved roast had no flavor. One evening we had pulled pork and the driest chicken I've ever tasted. For breakfast, I did enjoy their chorizo, onion, green pepper and spicy cheese egg scramble. I think they may have gotten a lot of compliments about it because they served it 3 days in a row. Ugh. Also if you plan on eating at pool bar you will experience the slowest service ever. It took an hour for them to make my salad. I kid you not. Iceberg lettuce and cheese takes an hour to make.   The gym was decent. A few treadmills, elliptical machines and bikes. A lot of weights which impressed me. Normally you don't find a lot of weights at a hotel gym.   The housekeeping staff and various staff maintaining the property were extremely friendly and made a point to call me by name every time they saw me (I think the dumb name tag my company made me wear helped with this. Haha). But it was still nice to have them say hello in the halls.  Overall, a great hotel. Just need to work on the food."}
{"text":"Definitely not the nicest place I've ever stayed but it was adequate for a couple days of relaxation. Doesn't have the typical 'resort' type feel, though they certainly charge like they do. The beds were small and the walls were extremely thin, I could hear everything in the two adjacent rooms and in the hallway. Also, my room was literally a 6-7 minute walk from the main lobby, it got really annoying by the second day I was there.   The hotel is in dire need of some updates, which it appears they may have been doing on the other side of the resort. And the worst part of everything by far was the food, Ko'Sin Restaurant was terrible. Overpriced and terrible, especially breakfast. The filet did NOT taste like a filet at all and the waffles at breakfast (not the buffet, the actual waffle entree) tasted like just normal stale bread. It's very clear that they know full well that you don't have really any other options to eat. And they take full advantage of that with the poor quality and outrageous pricing. The food at the bar out in the pool area was much better. Still not good, but much better. I literally purposely didn't eat the last day I was there until I left the resort. Not to mention that there were flies EVERYWHERE. A few fans out in the pool restaurant area would do that place a lot of good, there were none.   The pool area itself is decent and spacious, though the water itself is very shallow. The decor throughout was pleasant, nice Indian vibe to it all. The landscape and environment outside and surrounding the resort was really pretty but other than that there was nothing to write home about.   I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Service not what you would expect at a hotel in this price category. Very difficult to even get a cup of coffee once the coffee kiosk closes in the early afternoon.   Spa was excellent I wish I could review separately."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting Wild Horse Pass. I love the hotel, its beautiful. The pools are awesome! I stayed in a suite and that was good! Suits are a little far from the pool, but that's fine. The food is SOOO good. Everything you try is amazing! The only thing I can complain about is the new management. When I visited last year everything was perfect! This hotel is not cheap and the little things that the new management just couldn't get right made my stay a little more \"annoying\" this time. Little things like in the suite we didn't have sheets for the pull out bed even thought we had 3 people staying so they knew we would need it, had to sign in for WIFI everyday and accept a charge where when we called the front desk stated the charge would just \"fall off\",  no one at the front desk seemed to know the shuttle times (had to ask the guys that actually drove the shuttle), we asked for late check out at 4 and was told ok but then we got to the room at 4 and the keys didn't work (had to wait an extra 20 mins for someone to come open the doors and she seemed very annoyed by me and said they thought we were checking out at 12PM). There were some other little things and I know they are little but staying somewhere that is expensive you just don't want to worry about things like that. The staff is VERY friendly in the restaurants and by the pool. I stayed by the pool mainly and the service from Brian B, Andreas B, and Austin were FANTASTIC. They made our stay wonderful (we stayed by the pool the majority of the time). The hotel is great but the new management (different from last year) just needs to step up their game!"}
{"text":"100% prettiest, fanciest place i've ever seen in my life.  absolutely breathtaking.  from the lobby with rock features and waterfall, to the lit up painted ceiling, to the enormous pools that overlook golf courses and lakes as well as wide 360 views of the surrounding mountains, etc... just... wow.  even the stairs have little decorations as big as my head.  a random pot of flowers sitting in a corner was twice as tall as me.  i felt like a little ant."}
{"text":"I must say - business travel has spoiled me rotten. I came to Wild Horse Resort for a conference and I can't wait to go there for myself.   Let me step back - I don't like Phoenix. I don't like Arizona - I'm sorry! it's nothing personal, it's just too hot and sandy.   BUT this Sheraton is by far one of the most amazing resorts/hotels I've been to. I can't overestimate the staff and the accomodations. The whole place is a 3-story terracota where every room has a little balcony - I loved it! It's not in the city, so you get a magnificent view too. The staff was just applaudable.   At night, they have a bonfire going on the patio outside and guests just hang around, sipping wine or coffee or whatever.    Please take the time to check out their spa. It was the most luxurious experience, the whole spectrum, from the body wrap to the soap in their showers. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh   The restaurants were a little pricey and too fancy for my taste. I don't blame them though, I'm a simple girl - I just went to the pool side cafe and had a perfect pulled pork sandwich with pineapple chutney and avocado salad... Did i mention they were also showing football on TV?"}
{"text":"I stayed here last week and while  it is a fairly pleasant location it was not clean and the carpets in the rooms and hallways were very worn. The furniture in the rooms was very old and scuffed. There were toe nail cuttings on the bathroom floor. I would not stay here again."}
{"text":"I put my parents up here when they were visiting me from NY because it is literally the only decent hotel by my house and lord knows I was not driving to Scottsdale day and night to chauffeur them around the valley. It was my parents' 35th wedding anniversary and I let the concierge know upon checking in. He sent a very pretty arrangement of truffles, chocolate covered fruit, and champagne to the room, complimentary!  The hotel itself is beautiful, but I thought the rooms were not really worth the $400 a night I paid (this was mid-May). The room was just a lot smaller than I expected, though beautifully decorated. My mother loved her spa experience and we all loved dining at Ko'Sin for brunch.   There is a little boat that shuttles you to and from the casino, providing a relaxing and scenic ride. If you are smart you will just take the boat ride for the fun of it because the actual casino is a friggin dump. I would not recommend this place for any type of romantic getaway, which is unfortunate because it has such a seemingly peaceful and scenic atmosphere. The pool was totally overrun with rugrats. Screaming, jumping, running, you name it. Even worse is the hotel caters to this by showing kids movies by the pool at night. I can only think that this had something to do with the time of year? I hope so. Overall the staff was wonderful, the food was incredible, and I would not hesitate to recommend this place to any of my future out of town guests."}
{"text":"Was not given Starwood preferred room even though I qualify. Came for a conference and if you didn't know, this place is huge, I literally am the third furthest room from the conference, so inquire for a closer room if you are here for business!"}
{"text":"Hardly worth the price.  Resort is dated and in need of sprucing up. Especially rooms, pool and water area. Service is sub par. Sewage back up through bath tub hardly adds to the resort experience."}
{"text":"One of the dullest hotels I've stayed in.  Food was subpar.  Sheets smelled of mildew and A/C was not properly working.  When I woke up, I swear I thought I was in a cheap motel and not a Sheraton.  Wifi only in the lobby area.  There is free wired internet in the rooms."}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience at the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Pool area and bar are awesome. The weather was perfect for swimming. We had fun ordering room service. The internet in the rooms is sucks. We were there for a convention and the hotel took great care of us. Breakfast buffets in the morning and parties with drinks and food every night. It happened to be our anniversary and they did a lot to make it special. They sent chocolates and sparkling wine to the room, comped some of our meals and drinks, it was really nice.   The room was pretty comfortable, the AC could have been colder and there's no refrigerator. There was a nice throw that my wife enjoyed wrapping up in. We asked for a north facing room to keep us out of the sun and they did that for us. We had lovely shade all day.   The property is pretty cool. The architecture is neat, there's lots of little surprises. I saw a handful of cool animals including a coyote, some kind of wildcat, hawks, hummingbirds, baby jackrabbits, and an owl. There's a boat you can take to the casino and the Wild West attractions, but I didn't get to try it. It looks fun.  I would absolutely come back here given to opportunity. It's a beautiful resort and the people are the best! Shout out to William at the front desk and Ruth at the pool bar for being goddamn awesome! Four stars!"}
{"text":"This resort is absolutely amazing. I am an event planner for HP and I came here for a small event (about 15 people) and I never once felt like I was doing work. From the moment you enter the property you feel like you been whisked away do a little piece of heaven.  I had the opportunity to spend some time (8 hours) at the Aji Spa. EVERYONE should go there. I had everything done from a facial, to a hot stone massage, to a pedicure. The most tremedous spa experience I've ever had. If you have the opportunity to go to this spa - ask for Mike. He's like the jolly green giant with hands of an angel!!!!  Second, the pool...where do I begin. The scenery by the pool is outstanding. With the mountains in the background, the golf course in the foreground and a little tiki-hut type bar to serve you all day long, you can't go wrong here. There are multiple types of pools, hot tub, water slide, misting tents, and anything else you could want for a perfect day in the sun.  The FOOD!!! I'm a food junkie so I have pretty high standards. This place surpassed my expectations and blew me away. From the food we had catered for our event to the 7 course meal we had at Kai, my tastebuds was absolutely in heaven! After dining at Kai, I returned to my room to find a hand-written thank you note from my server with a little box of chocolates. Talk about impressive! That's a way to win a girl's heart and her business. Also, their wine list (approx. 600 wines) has everything you could ever ask for.  I have nothing but perfect things to say about this resort. The staff is amazing - I feel like every single person called me by name. The cultural manager came and spoke to our group about the history of the Pima and Maricopa tribes. What a fantastic story!! That made the stay that much more enjoyable...  I could ramble on for pages about this place, but if you want to know more just send me a message. I would be happy to rave some more!"}
{"text":"Bed bugs beware. Ooooooouch. Not a nice place to stay. Don't take complaints serious and blow you off to some quack claims people and hotel security director. A joke not very kind to real issues and looked for a scapegoat. It's their dirty, nasty and gloomy hotel rooms infested with bed bugs. See real proof. Don't ever stay here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 5 nights in late August. We got a killer last minute deal which is why I can say we enjoyed our stay. If we had paid regular price we would have been disappointed. The service is hit and miss. We had great service at the pool every day and at the golf course restaurant but based on what other reviewers have said about the staff I'm glad we didn't have any major issues that needed to be addressed. A huge complaint of mine would be that the restaurants, lobby bar and espresso bar seem to be on whatever schedule the staff decides that day despite the open/close times listed. I went down to the espresso bar every morning (around 8) and all but once it was already closed for the day. Same with the lobby bar. We would go every evening and only once was it open and we ended up leaving because we sat there for half an hour and the bartender still had not gotten to us. One day everything at the hotel was closed by 6 so we ended up having to take the boat to the casino and eat at the buffet. It was really shocking to us because it was summer and there were a lot of conferences going on so you would think everything would be super busy in the evenings. The other thing that should be noted is that EVERYTHING is soooo expensive. But that's typical with these kinds of resorts. And they don't comp things here. You will be charged for anything beyond just sleeping and the pool. Wi-Fi, using the gym, room telephones, etc.  And you will pay an arm and a leg eating at the restaurants. Again, this was not too bad for us as we got our room for cheap so paying so much for food kind of evened it out. We hardly ever saw hotel staff. It was like every day there were 5 people working the entire resort! The things I loved about staying here that made it all worth it are: The view is amazing! It's so beautiful spending the day lying at the pool with such spectacular surroundings. The food was actually really good. We had some expensive nice meals that were good and we had less expensive quickie stuff at the pool restaurant and golf course restaurant that was good as well (BBQ Chicken Pizza was so good). The rooms are nice. Again, I'm not sure they are as nice as they should be if you pay full price but for the deal we got we liked them. They are \"cozy\" and the bed is very comfortable. I didn't understand people complaining about having to walk so far to their room. It's a BIG resort and I thought the rooms all seemed close to the lobby (it's no different than being in Vegas and maybe having to walk through the casino to get to your room). It's nice that you can hop on the boat and get a ride down to the casino or just ride it and enjoy the scenery. We really didn't take advantage of the golf course or spa (food ended up taking up most of our budget) but we were fine with that. We stayed a Mon. - Fri. and most hotel guests were in conferences all day so we literally had the entire pool to ourselves most of the time. Every now and then a few others would come along but for the most part we felt like we were the only ones here and it was so quiet and peaceful. My one recommendation would be to get a rental car. We took a cab to the resort from the airport and we were OK for 2 days but then we started getting bored in the evenings. Besides, the casino there is nothing to do. We looked into the onsite car rental and OMG it was insanely expensive!! Like a 3 day car rental would have cost more than our entire trip!! So we called around to some local car rental companies and found a great deal and just took a cab to pick up the car. Overall, I would say this resort is good for older people who want peace and quiet and like to head to bed early or for families with young children. However, if you are paying full price it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife and parents to enjoy a staycation, and absolutely enjoyed my stay! The Ko'sin Restaurant is the perfect place for Sunday brunch. The grounds are immaculate and the pool even includes a water slide (was closed due to the rain during our stay, bummer!). I love the interior layout and main lounge area, which comes complete with plenty of seating and warm fireplaces below a ceiling full of Native American artwork. For those that enjoy a nice outdoor fire at night, they have that for you too! While I didn't participate in any, I saw many interesting events going on such as a culinary class. I've had the pleasure of having a business conference held here before and the top notch service carried over into that sector as well.  The only gripe I have is the persistence of smokers on the premises. The resort is supposed to be non-smoking, however on more than one occasion I had to leave my balcony to go inside on account of the nasty cigarette smell. Shore that little issue up and this place could be 5 stars in my book! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We had a lovely stay Saturday night for a family friends birthday party. I only deducted one star because it's kind of overpriced however as a resort that's to be expected. The pool area is nice however I wish they had a separate area for the kids pool and a more quiet area for the adult pool rather than right next to each other. The pools also aren't deep only 3 ft and some inches so we had to be on our knees to be able to cool off comfortably. However everyone in the group enjoyed the water slide.   Service was excellent, our room smelled like smoke when we checked in and they tried their best to move us however we let it ventilate and it was fine by the time we went to sleep. All the service by the pool and bars and restaurants, and even the door man and valet was excellent too.   The rooms are pretty large and updated, and the bathroom had a deep soaking tub with separate shower. They also allow dogs which is nice. However the walls are extremely thin and we were woken up very early by housekeeping knocking on other people's doors.   The boat taxi over to rawhide is a really nice option to have, and they also have shuttles to rawhide and the casino.   Overall it's a lovely place for a staycation."}
{"text":"As a Starwood Gold member I have to say the service here was literally \"worst in class\".  Don't bother going to the lobby bar...you will sit for hours before being served, don't rod food, they will mess up the order...Dont ask them to go out of their way...they won't.. As a gold preferred member I did not even get a Starwood preferred guest room...very irritating.  The concierge and pool bar manager were great, other than that the service was awful.  FYI...be ready to walk...the rooms are very spread out!"}
{"text":"Usually I stay at the Wild Horse Pass Hotel at the Casino; they were booked solid for my birthday 08/23/2013, so I ended up looking at the Sheraton instead. I'm going to try and make this as quick as possible (it didn't happen).  Price: -more expensive than I'm used to spending: $130 per night. -offers \"discounts\" including a caregiver discount, which I took advantage of. -price does not include $20 \"resort fee\" for spa and gym use, doesn't include taxes, etc. Expect to add on $30-$40 in fees.  Location: -isolated. Only things close by are the casino, Rawhide, and the new Phoenix Premium Outlets. -very secluded, makes for nice walks out on the nature trail. Picturesque views on golf course and via trail rides.   Rooms: -I was granted a courtesy upgrade (don't know why) to a \"preferred guest room\", which was very nice. Had a deep soaking tub and a standing shower, queen (?) size bed, personal patio, all the amenities and a view overlooking the lake/pool. -FAR WALK to the rooms. Almost every review discusses this. If you have elderly/young kids traveling with you, I would suggest requesting a closer room. -phone in my bedroom did not work (granted it looked like it'd been there since the 80s). -mini bar key must be obtained from the front desk or bell hop (mine didn't work, had to request a new one). -AC unit in the rooms does not sufficiently cool the space. I knocked it down to 65 degrees and it was barely tolerable in the room.  -Native American (Pima/Hopi) decorations throughout the room and resort.  Food/Beverages: -never got to experience either of the restaurants as they were closed during most of my stay. -room service comes with a hefty price, didn't see room trays cleared right away. -resort bar was also closed when I returned to the hotel.  Staff: -my check-in staff (gentleman) was very polite, he was the one who ungraded my room and gave me a gift certificate (free) to the Phoenix Premium Outlets ($25).  -was unable to reach the operator from my room as the phone wasn't working, had to call using my cell. However, she was very polite sending up the mini-bar key. -check-out staff was atrocious. It was hot and miserable in the lobby, a line of 5-6 guests were piling up. The woman who checked me out was very rude, I had questions about different fees/charges and also about the gift certificate. Her answers were very short and condescending.   Perks: -pretty nifty discounts with \"added perks\" like gift certificates if you look into it -free shuttle to and from the hotel/casino, the outlets and Rawhide I believe -mostly courteous staff, doors opened for you, etc. -loved the comfortable mattress and pillows-- slept like a dream  Dings: -parking lot is an eternity away. I will valet next time. -rooms are also an eternity away. Will plan on requesting a closer room. -bar/restaurants seem to have very limited hours for a high-end resort -pool closes at 11PM... what the hell. Seriously? it's Arizona.  -customer service not across the board (see checkout comment).  Would recommend spending several days/nights here as only booking for one will not allow you to take advantage of any of the amenities you're paying for."}
{"text":"Great resort, really nice rooms, and a great property with a great pool.  There is a creek that runs all over the property and it is a great little walk or run if the weather permits.  We usually go on stay-cation on the 4th of July to enjoy the pool and watch the fireworks show from Rawhide so we do not have to drive home in traffic.  There is a nice restaurant there and the service is spectacular.  Highly recommend this place, especially in the winter when the weather is best in Phoenix.  We came here this year with a huge group and the rain made it tough but they even hosted a festival inside one of their huge hall rooms (built for huge weddings) and the kids loved it and we got to have a bar and seating for the adults.  They took good care of us."}
{"text":"We loved this resort! They have an awesome pool area with a water slide. The golf course looked gorgeous. They also have 2 walking trails. One follows the golf course and a steam. And the other follows the man made creek they have and ends at the Rawhide western town. The resort also offers a boat ride to take you up and down the man made creek. We came in early November which was great because it is still warm enough to use the pool and it's their off season so the room rates are very affordable."}
{"text":"Our weekend get away to the Sheraton was very nice!  Pool was warm, my grandson enjoyed the water slide.  Staff at the pool kept the children and families busy with games of tug of war and races on the water slide!  It was very hot and umbrella coverage was minimal so bring lots of sunscreen!  Pools are only 3-3 1/2 ft deep only one is adult pool 5 ft. very small!  So it is family oriented, which is nice.  Hotel was very nice, rooms clean and comfortable and the staff very friendly!  The ground surrounding the hotel also very nice, peaceful and relaxing. They have a shuttle running all day so we were able to go to the casino as well as other areas of the resort.  There rooms do not have fridge so you'll need to bring an ice chest if you bring your own drinks or food.  We enjoyed our stay at this resort and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Wild Horse Pass resides in a beautiful desert locale with all the usual amenities one expects from a destination resort. Two restaurants, a coffee shop, spa, pool, conference rooms and outdoor areas for weddings and parties, etc.  On the plus side, I the service was great. Always attentive and friendly. The valets, front desk, room service, and restaurant staff were engaged and did their best whenever I needed assistance. Follow through and communication was particularly strong. And I was upgraded to a suite at check in, which was a nice perk.  Their fine dining restaurant, Kai, has a good reputation, but I didn't get a chance to try it. Perhaps I should have because I was underwhelmed by the other options. I found the food from Ko'sin and their banquet services to be typical hotel fare; average and overpriced. Nothing really bad, but nothing memorable or unique either. And the selection lacked variety or as much southwest influence as I might have expected. Though again, I want to note that the service was very good.   I also had mixed feeling about fit and finish of the property. The native southwest theme was fine but the decor was a bit out of date and in various states of repair. My suite was incredibly spacious, with great views, but it wasn't very comfortable. The couch was too hard to want to lounge on. The TV too small to see well. The dining table chairs were awkward, which made sitting at the table difficult. And the work desk was too small, with a chair that was loose and lacking in support. And the bed was too bouncy, which made sleep hard to come by. These are my own issues of course, but as subjective as they may be, I think people will readily see what I mean.  I've been fortunate to have stayed in many wonderful resort properties around the world, so at the risk of appearing immodest, I think I have a pretty good perspective on what makes a good resort and what doesn't. And while there were plenty of things I enjoyed about my stay, the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass isn't someplace I would seek out. Which is unfortunate, because the best resorts are places the make you look forward to returning to again and again. And Sheraton Grand at Wild Horse Pass isn't that."}
{"text":"Very upset that they roomed me below a room that was under construction. I had a nice jack hammer banging through the roof at 6:00AM. When I told the receptionist all she said was that is the \"normal\" time for them to start. Thank you for the non wanted wake up call and non wanted customer service. This is not a cheap hotel and gurantee you can find another resort that is newer and the same price."}
{"text":"Husband and I won some concert tickets for a show at the Wildhorse Pass Casino and since this hotel was full, we booked a room at the Sheraton.  We decided to splurge a little since we haven't been out for a while so decided to pay $160.00 for one night.   As usual, the resort is beautiful and very calming.  The room was nice, king size bed was fricking AMAZING and comfortable.  We only needed to sleep and weren't really here for all of the hotel amenities but super thankful that the bed and covers were awesome.  Now....here comes the BAD part.  For what you pay a night (even getting a deal on hotelfinder,com, etc.) you would think that the dang walls would be a little more soundproof than what they really are.  we could hear EVERYTHING!!!  Including the woman next door getting it on with her man whose headboard was against the same wall as our bed...   1a.m. in the morning this woman starts howling like an injured pig so stinking loud I could hear her breathing as well (again EVERYTHING).  People...please think vocal control when you are having sex in a resort room.   #1...she could do way better than what she sounded like., #2, if you are gonna go for broke, good god, come up with some better sex talk than what you were putting out.  Since I had to listen to it for 2 fricking hours before I started pounding on the dang wall!, #3 - PUT A SOCK IN IT!!!  It sounded like I was listening to the worst porno I have ever heard (and I have watched my fair share believe me - she would not cut it as a porn star for sure)  I will be much more hesitant to book a room here knowing that you have no sleeping peace during the night.  I was so disappointed. When we checked out, the lady asked us how are stay was and even after telling her it wasn't great, she just said, oh I am so sorry, I hope your next stay is better.  Seriously???  There won't be a next time.  Not for that price.  Luckily the bed helped a little.  Thank you for reading!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great stay at SGWHP. Special thanks to Nicole and her crew for the fun kids activities!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience.  Awesome rooms and friendly staff.  Will elaborate more later."}
{"text":"If you looking for a short getaway vacation or whatever it called...lol...this is one of the place that you should try. The services was awesome, from the staff, the room was clean, the food was awesome too; hot and worth to wait! For the spa, sometimes you can get discount from Groupon, just keep tracking ;). I would love to recommended this place to try and I planned to go back to try something else!"}
{"text":"Update. I'm taking back the nice things I said about the front desk staff. I should have waited to write my review until I checked out. Update (again):  I received a call from the housekeeping manager yesterday and he was very apologetic and assured me this was an aberration. He also gave me his contact information and asked for the opportunity to make it right by offering us a free night when we are again in the area. We likely won't, but it was a nice offer."}
{"text":"Came here for a work conference and couldn't be happier. The hotel staff was nothing but friendly.  This hotel is unique because the Native Americans really own the land so it keeps it more authentic. It's a beautiful place to stay.  There are a few places to eat on site. Lobby bar, Ko'Sin, Hanyo Pool Bar and one fancier place. I didn't eat at the fancy place on site but it sounds amazing. The pool bar is kid friendly and has frozen cocktails. Ko'Sin is upscale but not fancy (get the shrimp tacos) If you \"go green\" and opt not to use housekeeping during your stay, you can get SPG points which is cool.  The view of the sunset there is amazing although photos won't do justice.  Rooms were nice and included a personal patio with a table and chairs. The fitness center was nice and had plenty of space.  They had tennis courts, horseback riding and golf but I didn't do any of those. They have a water slide which looks very cool.  They provide towels for the pool so you don't have to use the in room ones.  The conference center is very nice and has lots of meeting rooms.  I would love to spend a few personal days here. They have a free shuttle to the casino and outlets for interested parties."}
{"text":"The self parking is close enough to the rooms but only one elevator which us located near the lobby. Most rooms are at the wings. They don't have any ramps for bringing up your bags from your car, just have to drag them up a curb and through gravel, then you must drag them up stairs or wheel them all the way back towards lobby for elevator then all the way back to your room. VERY inconvenient and impracticable!  The girl at the coffee/starbucks kiosk was very snobby and snooty. They have a green program where you can opt out if house keeping and get $5 gift card to spend at hotel. I called the desk two days in a row to opt out and housekeeping still came everyday, no $5 gift card either. The lack of a hotel gym is b.s. But the 3 mile running path is awesome. The pools are nice and the waiters are great by the pool. The water slide is fun and no lines! Walls are thin, you can hear the tv in the next room. Because of the pools and service at poolside,  I give this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"We visited for the casino only. It was a good place to get out of the heat and play, if you like to gamble. Free parking. It's not like Las Vegas so don't have expectations of free drinks being brought to you or 24/7 restaurants to eat at. Good choices of places to eat at from fast food to very expensive, exquisite dining. Very smokey, as all casinos are, but they do have a small non-smoking area. We had a good time. Mostly because we won. :)"}
{"text":"Stayed three nights for an on site conference.  Service is what you would expect.  Room is slightly less than what you would expect.  Food is fine.  Here is what I did not expect: as an SPG gold level member to be put in one of the rooms farthest from everything with a view of the parking lot.  To be charged almost $300/night AND THEN an additional $13/day for wired, yes wired, internet access in my room.  Insult to injury $8 for a beer.  And the \"authentic\" Native American decor - cheesy.  Almost to the point of insulting.  Burning sage in the lobby?  Really?  In summary, I felt they took advantage of a group bringing them several hundred customers for four days.  Fail."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful spa day... Yoga, meditation, and massage... Service is excellent, amenities perfect and clean, and food/drinks deLicious... Be prepared to pay because it was pricey"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE RESORT. I wish I could put no stars but I have to put at least one. My stay started by the security guard barging into the room after I asked for pillows. He was rude and very unprofessional.   Second off, my truck was STOLEN out of the front parking lot. Yes, stolen. When we notified security they proceeded to inform us that there are NO CAMERAS to \"protect the privacy of the guests\". What happens if someone were to get raped or murdered in their parking lot. We called the cops and they also informed us that 30 trucks have been stolen from the area in the past 2 months. After all of this has happened, they still don't have any cameras.   Sheraton should have compted my 2 suite 2 night stay at this world renowned resort that \"celebrities stay at all the time\". My own personal safety has been violated. And now I have to buy a new truck."}
{"text":"They take your money. Give you a confirmation number. You show up. They have your confirmation but no room available. Staff is excuse oriented instead of results oriented. Go to the Superbowl and no room. It became my 100% responsibility to find another hotel. They even put our luggage in someone else's room. You could not make up how badly this hotel fell flat on its face."}
{"text":"I recently stayed at your hotel and it was awesome the staff was extremely responsive and attentive and everything was great until the last day when we decided to take the kids swimming, one of the pools had something I don't know excessive chlorine or what but as a result two of my kids who were not wearing swimming googles had extremely painful and swollen eyes and we left the resort with kids in pain and crying. The two kids are traumatized and don't want to go swimming again. I was told by the attendants by the pool side that we were not the only ones who complained about it.  So our extremely wonderful stay turned into a disaster, the EMT on site visited us and did a report and he was also very helpful.  I know things like these happen so I wanted to give the  hotel a chance to fix this issues  but I never heard from them I emailed them about a month ago."}
{"text":"I am a big Sheraton fan and this location does not disappoint either. Very nice set up, location is perfect. Lots of activities, a perfect getaway. I gave it one less than perfect score because of the rooms that seem not only dated but quite small. Being a platinum SPG member, I am a bit spoilt with better rooms than this."}
{"text":"This hotel is very secluded, especially at night. The decor blends in very well with the locale and is Southwestern themed. Specifically Native Indian. Reminded me of Sedona AZ. They piped in music all over the property ( except in the rooms ) that was Native indian flutes. Charming but i felt bad for the workers who have to hear it 8 hours a day. They did a great job creating ambiance.   This place is huge and i spent quite a bit of time walking all over to finally find my room on the 2nd floor. The rooms were clean and the bed linens were 1st class and very comfy. My welcome letter included a voucher for breakfast which was quality ingredients all the way. Fresh eggs, sliced bacon, roasted and seasoned potatoes. The extra deep tub in the bathroom accommodated my large stature for a relaxing nice hot soak. Score.  This is definitely a 4 star hotel at a great rate. Really liked it was off the beaten path. Super relaxing and quiet."}
{"text":"Stayed here for a week for work. Overall heard wonderful things about the hotel but was less than impressed during my own stay.  Upon checking in, we had to walk nearly 7 minutes to our room to discover the card didn't work. We walked all the way back to the front desk with our luggage and got a new door key and then walked all the way back to our room to then discover the provided us to twins rather than the requested king. At which time we had to walk all the way back to the front desk where they said all rooms were filled and they could not help. Since the hotel was nearly dead other than the people at our work group we knew that was false and made a call the next morning and got a new room. Though the view was of parking lot.  While the rooms certainly are not my cup of tea, they fit the Arizona style and imagine most would find them appropriate.  The lobby is filled with some sort of spa spray that was absolutely nauseating.  The main highlight was the staff were all extremely nice and welcoming (aside from the late night check-in staff). Food was good, albeit not a lot of options compared to other hotels.  All in all, Arizona is not a place I would typically travel by choice, and I imagine this hotel is much better than the competition. My main suggestion would be to remove that horrible over powering aroma in the main lobby area."}
{"text":"This hotel is wayy out of the way from any city.  You would probably miss it driving along the freeway.  From the beginning of the entrance down to the front door is a long drive, so keep driving and you'll get to this mirage.  The people are courteous, making you feel welcome.  The lobby sees out to the Arizona landscape and swimming pool.  Unfortunately the dining is lacking.  There is horseback riding and other casinos nearby, along with a Spa, and plenty of places to ride your bike.  The pools have a slide and waterfalls, and outdoor food service + bar.  It is the very definition of a resort.  Sleeping under the stars like a cowboy, but also enjoying the luxurious life of a resort."}
{"text":"I came home and there was an extra $13.97(U.S.) charge on my credit card from this joint.  Is this a racket?  Did I not prepay some kind of Occupancy Tax for the Rez?    My charges upon checking out were: NY Times, Arizona Republic, bockkle of orange juice = $5.25 x 2   (I woulda drunk up a storm at the nifty pool-side bar, but it's Arizona and I gotta drive places, baby.)  Well I talked to Kristie in accounting (who must have a cool job, if you're going to be an accountant why not at a resort?) it was some kind of computerized mini-bar malfunction, she tells me, and zip--it's off the bill.    I appreciate this kind of service."}
{"text":"Wonderful hotel. Everyone was so accommodating and nice to ensure we had a great stay. I would definitely recommend it. My only disappointment was not getting a rsvn at Kai. Sunrise horseback riding Roger and Chuck were great! Spa day was lovely and Sheila did get job taking care of my niece so the adults could go to the adult only spa. The guys out front were awesome and my niece loved the s'mores night and the water slide. Great hotel!"}
{"text":"Beautiful grounds, great service and staff, and immaculate room-- Excellent!  Stayed at the Wild Horse Pass Sheraton for a conference and it was a stellar experience. I've been to the hotel to dine at Kai (a religious experience), but this was my first stay. It's truly is a gem and the displays sharing the Gila River Indian Community's history was worth the time to learn.   Check-in was a breeze and the employee from Lahaina was as quick and courteous as I've seen. I was up to my room quickly, which was comfortable, well-appointed, and clean. Then made my way down to the patios and water areas for a reception, which was just enjoyable. The food and service staff were both awesome!  Had time permitted, I would have stayed longer to enjoy the pools, golf, and shopping at the tribe's Premium Outlet. Had to head home for work, instead. Will be back to enjoy things another day.  (One knock: The restaurant in the lower area of the lobby insisted on holding my credit card, which I wasn't comfortable with. The gentleman who served us was rather pushy and, so, I relented. But I believe it violates PCI standards for physical card security since it was out of site, with a service person, and unmonitored.)"}
{"text":"This review is specific review for \"Reflections\" bar at the Wild Horse Pass. Tammy, the bartender makes an excellent Cadillac Margarita."}
{"text":"This resort is 4 stars for those within its price range, and 3 stars overall.  It's located in a very secluded area with at least 4 minutes of driving off any marked road to get to the resort. Clearly the reason is the golf course and the space it requires. There's also a few tiny manmade streams and a trail for \"hiking\" which is more like walking or running as its a flat and well-marked path.   There are 2 restaurants, one of which is the pretentious and well-known Kai which is known for rejecting diners based on the dress code. (Oh and also for its AAA rating). There is also a pool bar, a cafe, and a cafe at the spa.   Amenities also include a large outdoor pool and spa and a boat ride that leads to a somewhat cheesy \"Wild West town.\" Additionally there is a free shuttle running every 15-30 minutes (depending on the season) to the Prime Outlets and casino, which are about 10 min away.   This resort overall has friendly service at the desk for check in and the general staff. I came for a conference and it feels adequate but not luxurious. The prices during early Sept (off season) were reasonable, under $130 / night. Given that this resort is comprehensive but by no means luxurious, I can't imagine paying more than $175/night. The resort fee is $25/night and doesn't even include spa facility access! (A paid day pass is required). Additionally, given that the resort is so secluded you lose the benefit of being able to explore Phoenix unless you have a car or disposable uber funds. (I prefer resorts with more walkability to local sites)  Overall a pleasant experience for a conference setting but I don't plan on booking my next vacation here!"}
{"text":"Stayed after concert cheaper than dui driving home after, rooms were really clean and nice features, again it seems like the Arizona Casinos are slightly over priced on rooms, we at dinner and breakfast there in casino very large selection compaired to the other casinos, as far as show room it was nice chairs and seating could be different for my liking but it was funtinal"}
{"text":"If I could go negative stars I would. No cold water for the showers (its 115 degrees outside); NO WIRELESS INTERNET (not even if you wanted to pay for it). A/C and toilets are both broken...I reported all to the front-desk and 12 hours later, still not fixed. .You couldn't pay me to step foot on this property again."}
{"text":"This is the fourth time I have stayed at this resort. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Every mother's day weekend my bf and I go there for a private event help by City of Hope to raise money for breast cancer awareness. The staff always is there helping us with whatever we need. The rooms are always clean and beautiful. I love the pool, since you have a few to choose from. There is a pool with a slide, water spouts and one that is a gradual. The drinks are pretty good too such as the prickly pair mojito. I suggest getting an order of fries and onion rings because it was a huge order for 8.50 and the onion didn't just come out with one bite leaving you with all the batter. I cannot wait to volunteer again and help at next year's event."}
{"text":"Third and final update from this resort from Hell. Needed aspirin for a sick family member at about 10 pm. No gift shop open of course. Should be no problem,  right?  Registration Desk had nothing that you would typically find at any two star Holiday Inn Express anywhere in country such as toothpaste, aspirin, toothbrush, razor, etc.   Here is another important element to this resort to keep in mind.  There are no restaurants, convenient stores, gas stations anywhere near it for miles. You are trapped here. Isolated. Nothing near here except tumbleweeds and the empty golf course.   Want a six pack? Have to drive 30 minutes round trip to nearest gas station/ convenient store. Want something besides their 16$ oatmeal or 30$ cheeseburger for a snack? You have to drive 20 minutes to Outlet Mall to find the food court.  Any full meal for anything is 40+$ per person and that is at the Casual restaurant on site.   So, in middle of night I had to drive 30 minutes round trip to the gas station to get aspirin for my sick family member.  Save your money and of headaches and stay anywhere else unless your company is stupid enough to pay for this place."}
{"text":"Wow, this resort did not disappoint!  I spent three days here this past week to attend a conference at this gem in the middle of the desert located on a reservation.   Everyone that works there was really pleasant, I didn't interact with them much, but in the handful of times I did, they all had cheery attitudes and treated me like I was royalty or something...at least that's how it came across in my head.  This resort is four stories high and very wide; my boss's room was located at the verrrry end of the other side of the hotel, far away from the conference center (a Segway would have come in handy for guests to get around).  Luckily, my room was up the stairs and around the corner, so I had time to run back to my room between seminars.  My room was cozy and I enjoyed the comfy king size bed once I crashed out.  I made use of the bath tub my first night and slept like a baby after;  it was a long day of traveling, getting situated, networking all followed by cocktails, an awesome surf & turf dinner and more networking.  This resort is really nice and relaxing.  I was there for a conference with hundreds of other Human Resource professionals from other colleges and universities throughout the U.S. and it looked like everyone was genuinely having a good time and happy to be there.   There really isn't much nearby except the fairly new Wild Horse Pass Hotel & Casino (which can send a complimentary Lincoln Navigator shuttle over to pick you up in less than ten minutes, it took them six minutes to get me one night).  But the big pool that I had a view of from my room's balcony looked inviting; there was a big twirling water slide that the kids at the resort maximized their usage on.  Anyway, the hotel is beautiful, but pricey.  It was on my company's dime, but it would certainly be a nice getaway for anyone looking for a little rest and relaxation.  I'm not sure if I'll ever find myself back in Chandler anytime soon, but if I am, I know I'll want to stay at this fine establishment again.  Kudos to Starwood Hotels (which the Sheraton is part of) for going green and rewarding my Starwood Preferred Guest account with five hundred points for opting not to have housekeeping clean my room while I was a guest; I was hardly in my room so there wasn't much to clean anyway...besides, it's the Virgo in me to not be a slob."}
{"text":"Stayed here for a one night getaway after we were done having fun at the wildhorse pass casino. The resort is very beautiful and large! I loved the room we stayed in and the bed was heavenly and ranks up there as one of the best. the room is decorated in native american style and has all the amenities that you expect from a nice resort. I would stay here again but would come earlier to enjoy the rest of the resort.  The only thing I was not prepared to do was walk so far to our room and my feet were sore from dancing and the hubster was exhausted. Btw if your coming from the casino just turn right and keep driving until you see the Sheraton sign."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful and it has everything you need. I love to play the golf courses. Tough golf courses. Play them from the tips and you will know what professionals have every weekend. The pool is such a relaxing place to chill and have a margarita. And then there's Kai. I heard it's one of only 14 restaurants in the country that are both 5 Star and  Diamond."}
{"text":"This place has everything on the grounds: 6 swimming pools, a water slide, ponds, the Gila River, a boat taxi, spa, casino, equestrian center, golf courses, a gift shop, a deli/coffee shop, a lobby bar, and 4 restaurants. All the rooms each have a balcony with table and chairs. The rooms are equipped with 52\" flat screen TVs. The bathrooms each have a tub and standup shower. Even though it was my first time in the Phoenix area, I didn't want to leave the resort. And even though we did spend 2/3 of our time on the resort (we were in town for a total of 4 days), we didn't get enough time to enjoy all the facilities. For $95/night (thanks, Expedia!), this was worth every penny! The spa is way overpriced, but the price of food was fair, especially at Hanyo Pool Bar & Grill."}
{"text":"I came here on a business trip I was less than impressed. They claim to be the #1 Sheraton in the nation for hospitality and quality service's....haha! Upon checking in they decided to hold my debit card for $200 a night in case of incidentals. Now if you have a credit card, they won't change you anything...rediculous! When I explained that I was on a business trip and that there would be no incidentals, the GQ guy behind the counter said \"it's policy and if you don't like it, then you don't have to stay\". I asked to speak to a manager and he told me no one was available...yeah right!! I think he was just on a power trip.   The room was nice nonetheless, but it smelled like smoke...grose! Especially for someone who has never smoked. But they made it a point to tell me it was a nonsmoking room while checking in and with the signs/cards all over the room.   Also, don't bring your gym cloths unless you want to take a hike to the facility (seriously) and then pay $20/day when you get there. Something they don't tell you on their website.   The pool is really cool, especially for kids with the twisty slide. They also have a fire pit to roast marshmallows. The best part of the whole trip was the boat ride to the Rawhide Ranch. The Ranch was ehh, but the boat driver was a riot with his awesome serenading voice. He is the reason for the additional star and that is it!   I'm sure glad that I wasn't footing the bill otherwise I would have been super disappointed."}
{"text":"Very nice place... stayed two nights for my wife's work function... Beautiful grounds, nice Native American Indian motive throughout...  As a previous review noted, the grounds are spread out over a wide area...  but we were not dismayed as it allowed us an opportunity to walk off some of the GREAT food this place serves...  Would have given 5 stars if their 5 star restaurant was open... but as we were there Sunday and Monday nights, which are the same nights that Kai is closed, I was EXTREMELY disappointed I did not get to try their menu, along with the extensive wine list!  My wife enjoyed her Aji spa treatment provided by her company (facial) and said it's the best she's had, and she's had her fair share over the years...  Didn't need them, but I would have been bummed had I needed either WiFi or the Gym, as they charge for both..."}
{"text":"Disappointed with Sheraton. Definitely not a 5 star hotel. The pool service was awful, at best, and the food was just ok for the price. The walls were thin enough to hear the tv and other sounds coming from the next room. The ice machine by our room wasn't working during our three night stay. The pool wasn't heated AT ALL and the freezing kids got kicked out of the hot tub. Nice grounds and the hiking trail was great. If you stay here review your final bill before checking out! I will be looking elsewhere for our next visit."}
{"text":"Beautiful hotel and grounds for the price. You will pay more for hotels that are not as nice in the area. They are located just off of I-10 and south of the 202, but very easy to get to. Go to the lobby and get some Starbuck's Coffee in the morning and then take the 2.5 mile walk around the resort. I saw a road runner, rabbits, lizards and birds. If you are lucky, you may see a rattle snake or other interesting wild life. Don't worry, they are more affraid of you. The views from the room is awesome. The staff is awesome. Depending where your room is at, it can be a long walk from the lobby to your room. We where at the end on the 3rd floor and I was told it's a quarter mile from the lobby to my room. Not a big deal at all."}
{"text":"This is a nice hotel but the staff is a little lacking. We reserved a King bed and when we checked in they only had 2 queens. So they \"upgraded\" our room. All this meant was a room with a view if the pool the were working on.  In the morning when I was asked \"how was your stay\", I replied \"not very good since we did not get the room we reserved\". The hotel employees response was \"sorry to hear the, you have an outstanding balance on the room do you want to keep it on your card?\"   Horrible customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"What a beautifu hotel!  It's got three pools and a waterslide.  The restaurant is very good here as well and the staff are friendly.  What's to complain about?  The resort structure...why do I feel like I have to walk everywhere to get from point A to point B???  The layout makes it very inconvenient to go anywhere around here."}
{"text":"The hubby's employer held an event here. We didn't stay overnight so can't comment on the rooms, but as we were driving the 1.5 miles from the main entrance to the convention center lobby, I found myself thinking I would love to come back and explore the grounds.  It's absolutely beautiful, secluded and private. While we were waiting in line to check in, they served us h'or d'oeuvres. Thought that was pretty neat.  I had two margaritas, and unfortunately the beers were stronger. Tasted like fruity lemonade. Disappointing- was it because I had a drink ticket? Dinner was a buffet, with chicken and steak as the main dishes, and it was also so-so. I should have filled up on their salad (with peppercorn ranch dressing) and bread because those were the best items. I hope it's not what they serve in their restaurant, because it definitely wouldn't be worth the price. The service was the best part, and it was pretty top-notch.   I would like to stay here someday, would be a nice get-away. I'm sure things are better if you are an actual guest of the resort versus part of some corporate party."}
{"text":"This resort is absolutely beautiful.  Recommend walking around the trails and golf course early in the morning as there is an amazing variety of bird noises everywhere....  There is a lot of attention to detail in the landscaping which I have a great appreciation for. I stayed for 4 nights. The reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the food and drink here is repulsive. You can't get a drink by the pool without taking down a lot of nasty mixer and corn syrup...  Call me picky, but I don't eat meat. The golf club restaurant screwed my order up twice but the server was chill so I payed double and walked out without eating. I don't like to complain and certainly not to get a \"free-be.\" The drinks are 10 bucks. I recommend getting a smoothie from ko-sin restaurant and taking it to one of the other bars to be mixed with Malibu, however, that bumps your drink up to 16 bucks and they stop selling smoothies at 2. After that, you are on your own, shoveling gmo corn syrup down your gullet which kind of sucks because you're on vacation and want to crush tons of awesome frozen drinks poolside but they only sell over priced crappy ones!!!!.  Ko'sin isn't that good. They have one vegetarian breakfast option that is granola. It's retardedly expensive and served w/ warm soy milk. The second time I got it(for lack of anything better) I specifically asked for COLD soy milk because of my previous experience and they still sent it to my room warm. It was $26 and some change for 1 smoothie and 1 bowl of \"native oats\" granola.... Wtf?!!! Sheridan?!! For a place that exploits native american culture as much as this, im surprised how non-sustainable the menus are at all the restaurants throughout the resort... These are a people known for being in tune w/ nature and the fact that its hard to get a meal without a dead animal on your plate really upsets me as it did their ancestors when white folks like myself slaughtered all the buffalo. The Sheridan fronts some \"green initiative\" but its totally b.s.  they serve bottled Nestle tap water everywhere throughout the resort, which is such a horrible and non-ethical company in itself. They have a huge history of child labor practices and 0ver 70% of their chocolate is still produced that way today!!!.... see these two links: http://thecnnfreedomproject.blogs.cnn.com/2012/06/29/nestle-advances-child-labor-battle-plan/.  http://stopnestlewaters.org/communities/mecosta-county-mi.  I wrote this review because I'm calling on Sheridan and the world to change. I don't want anything more than that... (And quit partnership with Nestlé!!)"}
{"text":"This property is quite lovely and the service all around was very nice. Friendly in the lobby, friendly in the restaurant, nice pool, great view of the Arizona desert, and the rooms were adequate. I mean they were a bit warm as was the lobby. That might be from opening and closing the doors all day in the sunshine, I don't know. Your server in the downstairs bar leaves a bit to be desired - very unfriendly. We're locals and can come and go anywhere in the valley and be treated a bit better. I'd definitely return for the food though."}
{"text":"First I must say this review is not for the wait staff all of whom are off the hook. I'm here for a business convention and I got a suite for $430 a night so that I could entertain my colleagues a bit. We are not young people, all pretty much in our fifties and up. This past Friday night we had a little soirée in the room while enjoying some appetizers that we ordered from room service. After awhile there was a knock at the door and it was a Security guy (who looks like he's done some steroids in his life) and his side kick.  They asked me if anyone had been smoking cigarettes. Nope. We are not smokers.  Then they moved to \"it smells like marijuana\".  Are you kidding me? I'm standing out in the hall telling the guy that this isn't the crowd for that and he pretty much says he can call the police and they can come investigate. I might have said \"bring it on\" another night but I was entertaining business colleagues and they told me that the police would likely search all of them and the room if I didn't sign a $250 \"Cleaning fee\" form. At this point I'm thinking it feels like a shakedown and I'll sign the form and share with a manager later. Can't imagine subjecting my business colleagues to the cops coming at 11 pm when we have early morning meetings and well, it's just not classy. I hoped they had a video of the whole thing because there's no chance anything was going down in my room. As a matter of fact, I had four ten year old kids asleep in the adjoining room and the guy said if I was doing anything,  I was also \"endangering minors\".  Are you kidding me? So I called \"management\" before checking out. Sedrick was unavailable. The front desk gal said she'd remove the charge and have a manager call me. I told her the story and she said i deserved more than the charge removed. Nice but then, Austin, the \"manager\"defended the tactics and said he'd talk to his security to see who was telling the truth. He also said i should have let the police come if i wasn't \"guilty\". Now, listen Austin, it's hard to tell how old you might be but I have a feeling you're under 30. I've been on this planet long enough to think paying $250 to avoid them late at night is a worthy cause (especially when a few of us have enjoyed a cocktail or two) and most people would think is a rather smart move.  Austin even said that I admitted to security they one of my guests \"was smoking in the room\". No chance!! I said he may have smoked before stopping by. No such luck to have cameras in the hallway because the two Security guards would lose their job when they were found to be embellishing the facts.  I also noticed these two wanna be cops hassling some people at the pool and keeping a close eye on people in the bar. Wait, am I at a Starwood Resort property or in Mexico where perhaps this kind of stuff goes unnoticed?"}
{"text":"This is one of the most beautiful and peaceful places in the valley.  I've had the privilege of visiting this resort on a few different occasions and for a variety of reasons.  From the stay perspective:  Native American themed room. Nice comfortable bed. Very lovely and spacious room with a beautiful balcony.  Wonderful radiantly beautiful sunsets everyday in the desert.  From the Dining and Entertainment:  I've been to all of the restaurants in the resort.  Kai lives up to its name and reputation and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting the resort or the casino.  I've come for cocktails on the patio and sat outside by the fire pit.  This is my favorite part of this resort.  That terrace/patio is just fantastic.   The walkways to the rooms are laced with benches for quiet moments and conversations and to steal a moment just before sunset.  From the Events perspective:  I've attended a couple of meetings and most recently, the Fashioneta Fashion show.  I will be honest, for the table service during the fashion show, our server was quite rude and unpleasant.  But in general, during other events, the staff has always been pleasant to me.  The facilities are beautiful.  This is one of my favorite places to go to in the valley.    Return factor: 100% ."}
{"text":"Oh how sweet this place is! Serene and engaging. It it beautifully designed and restful with the many water appointments and private areas to just relax and feel peaceful. You buy much more than a room here. You buy a peaceful experience. I long to stay here again."}
