{"text":"Got there at 5pm for food and drinks before the show next door. Got served a warm beer after a 20min. wait. The food never showed. 2 hours later a plate of soggy, nasty, cold looking fries come to my table at the Improv. Horrible service and very inefficient. You have been open long enough to have worked out this kinks by now. I'm extremely dissapointed. Our group was over 20 people. That's a lot of business and tips to lose for a not so busy Saturday afternoon. You've been open for some time now so no excuses to not have these kinks worked out by now."}
{"text":"The food is alright (actually the brussel sprouts are bomb) and I love the live bands. My biggest issue is the service. I've been to copper blues probably 5 times and each time the service is well below average. Once or twice I'll say \"okay maybe they're understaffed\", but it's every time. 

For example forgetting drinks and now checking on tables. It's taken 20 minutes to get a drink twice and last time they for got an order of food and drinks. If the service were good I say solid 4, maybe 4 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"This review would have been a two star rating but having not one but TWO dirty glasses brought to you was more than enough to bring this rating down to a one star. Sorry copper blues tempe but the phoenix one never had a problem like this. Other than that mess, the food was good, beer was good and our waitress, who I'm not so sure deserved the tip we gave her because she brought us dirty glasses two times in a row, was \"ok\". Not sure if I'll come back to this copper blues."}
{"text":"Great service at the bar, very friendly. Tried the mussels, which were delicious, and filet bites, which were just small pieces of steak with a choice of two dipping sauces. The Bloody Mary sauce that came with the bites was good, but the pesto was outstanding. Highly recommended. 

I was sitting at the bar with my gf when Bryan Callen walked in, and we decided on the spur of the moment to catch his show at Tempe Improv next door. While we waited, a live band set up and played right behind the bar. Overall, a really great experience. It's a little different than the Cityscape location, but has enough similarities to feel comfortably familiar if you've been there. Definitely worth checking out if you're in Tempe."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food (pretzels, nachos, burgers, pizzas, all amazing). Unbelievable beer selection. Love the atmosphere. Only downside? Not open for lunch. =("}
{"text":"Amazing...food was great, service was attentive, drinks were strong and the band (The Walkens?) were incredible...I downloaded the Yelp app just to write this review!

We're from out of town but can't wait to cone back!"}
{"text":"Great very very fun place.  The karaoke is amazing...its with a live band!  The bar was pretty packed so there is was a bit of a wait, but the atmosphere was really jumping so it didn't matter.  Plus the whole downtown area is a blast to walk around now.  We really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"This place is too amazing! The band was on a whole other level! They has live band karaoke and that was great. Our server was very good, attentive, and friendly. I can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Their happy hour prices are very good and they have a lot of beer on tap. Their bar food is very tasty as well.

The interior is well designed and is quite spacious. I really think the place is a good alternative to four peaks, which got unnecessarily expensive and crowded."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place was here. I didn't eat but I know this is an atmosphere highly sought after all over our country. It is right next to Tempe Improve and has live music which is awesome I might add. Great for a drink with your significant other friends."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink before I went to the improve.. bartender was fast
..but seats were all full except outside on the patio. Where you can't see the band..boo. Bright side..the band was amusing, completely unpretentious and the crowd was having a good time!"}
{"text":"Boom! First time to Copper Blues Tempe? Epic Success!

We has the pretzel appetizer with beer cheese. Let men just tell you, if beer cheese is up your alley, you won't be let down. The mini baguette shaped pretzel and a generous dish of cheesy magic is DELISH. 

Now, if you brought your appetite, get the chicken nachos. There's enough for four. No exaggeration. Instead of a flat nacho tray, Copper Blues serves this dish in a mountain of crispy chips, black beans, cheese, chicken, Pico de Gallo, and a cream based spice sauce for a bit if heat. Oh my gosh. YUMMMM. 

Becca was our server, and she was a blast. Totally on top of our drinks and food, and had us cracking up. She also knew how to check in on us without interrupting the a conversation. A+++ girl! 

And, BONUS, the band that was playing tonight was excellent. Apparently, they play on Wednesday nights (they're called Chad Gregory and the Truth, or the Chad Gregory band... I think). Gritty rock n roll vocals and exceptional rhythm section. Seriously talented fellows. Can't wait to see them again. 

If you're looking for a fun, casual place to hang out, with great decor, fabulous food, and stellar entertainment (and a Wednesday, no less. Who else does that?!), look nice further. 

Copper Blues, tonight was a pleasure. Thank you!"}
{"text":"If u stop in the Brussels sprout appetizer is great. We also had the drummies, Mac & cheese, and cheese sandwich,  all of which were very good.  Happy prices are $3 off. They have 60 beers on tap. Have been here 3 times and had a very enjoyable experience each time."}
{"text":"Happy hour 7 days a week! Can't beat that! Craft beers and mixed drinks are on special along with tasty appetizers and flatbreads. And that view........"}
{"text":"After a lackluster experience I received a message from the owner offering us tickets to the next show we wanted to see. Not only did they get the tickets,  they also reserved us a table in the front row and made sure we had great service.  I really appreciate owners who care about the experience of their patrons. After the show we stopped in to have a couple beers and were pleased with the service.  2 thumbs up copper blues!"}
{"text":"Have to applaud the service and camaraderie at this awesome place! 
The band we got to hear, Black Bottom Lighters, were not only great musically, they were really nice guys.
The manager, Jackie, is one of the most accommodating ppl I've met and extremely professional.
The bartender, Jaramie, is as cool as her name.
Anyone who is smart enough to come here will be glad they did!"}
{"text":"I love the Copper Blues located downtown. I was excited that one opened closer to home.
This location has great beer as well, the food was ok. The service was embarrassingly bad.

We got sat by a hostess pretty quickly and then sat at that table for almost 20 minutes before our waitress came over. When someone finally came to the table it was a girl who had walked by multiple times without acknowledging us. 

She was quite obviously chewing a large wad of gum as she was talking to us. She didn't know anything about the beers and told us the beer cocktails on the table displays weren't available at this location.

We ordered beers and told her by the time she brought them out we'd know our food. Took another 10 min to get the beers, she set them on the table without looking up and walked away without getting a food order.

By the time I was almost finished with my beer she finally came back and took a food order. 

The food was ok, our appetizer and entr√©es came out at the same time, the appetizer (fries w/ gravy and cheese curds) was cold.

Our second round of beers my boyfriend ordered a Joy Rye'd. She brought us another Noche Dolce, and told us we were just confused by how dark the rye beers can be. (I have extensive beer knowledge and have tried both of those beers before)

Overall, I was disappointed by the experience. However, I won't let one waitress ruin it, we will be back again to try it out. I will update if the experience is better."}
{"text":"Bf n I been here a few times and love it. They have live band every weekend. Just a fun relaxing atmosphere. They have a good selection of beers of tap. My favorite is four peaks arizona peach and their nacho supreme is amazing!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I really wished I had a better experience. The waitress was nice (when I got the chance to see her) the music was great, the pepperoni pizza was probably one of the best pizzas I've ever tasted. 

HOWEVER, I should have known when the waitress kept apologizing over and over for the wait time (before it got busy) that this was not going to be a great experience.  I had patience as the appetizer took a while, not busy but no problem.  Then we got drinks. Wrong drink. She took it back immediately and brought the right drink. We had all of our food out and I had to wait 25 minutes to get another drink. Waitress again apologized then tried to get it taken care of. I told her it was fine.  Get the bill and we are over charged. The wrong drink was billed to me.

Sitting at our table for 40 minutes trying to pay our bill and everyone else around us has come and gone. So frustrating. Drove 35 minutes from goodyear to come here to celebrate and leaving frustrated is a horrible feeling. I love supporting local bands but it was not worth the frustration."}
{"text":"One of the best bars that serve food I have been to. The staff was fantastic. When I asked if they had salsa for the nachos she actually sent someone next door to get some for us. We had the chicken nachos, the pretzel with a beer cheese sauce and the Mac and cheese with bacon.  All were hot and excellent. Well presented. And served with a smile.  They have a live band Thursday thru Saturday and have all kinds of beer on tap as well for you beer drinkers. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Go on Thursday Nights for Black Bottom Lighters
Tempe Improv right next door, makes for a nice \"dinner and a comedy show\" date.
The live music with no cover is a awesome! 
Beer selection is great!
Food options are diverse and unique for the atmosphere..
from mac n cheese and pizza to gravy fries, calamari, and grilled cheese
happy hour 4-7
prices aren't great and aren't bad.
pizza is tasty.

just check it out!"}
{"text":"Fun bar right next to Tempe Improv on the second floor.  Great service. Cool decor.  The stage for bands is right behind the bar.  They had Angry Orchard on tap which was cool plus other yummy offerings.  We were here for a special event.  They are only open seasonally so check before you go.  I'm not sure what their schedule is.  Would like to go back on a regular night to update my review."}
{"text":"my group was hanging out here before the comedy show next door. the location is convenient, the atmosphere is awesome. the band was meh, the food (what little i had) was good and the drinks are strong!"}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC. I came here for the first time with my boyfriend a couple of weeks ago and it exceeded my expectations. The beer selection was unparalleled and the food was amazing. We ordered the nachos and got a heaping pile of deliciousness. There was a band playing and the atmosphere was built for fun.

Overall, great place to enjoy a beer, some great food, and good music."}
{"text":"My girlfriend, her brother, his girlfriend and I came to copper blues last night after the comedy show, everything seemed to be going good for the most part. We got seated right away, the local band was playing some pretty good music and everyone was happy!  Eventually about 10 to 15 minutes go by and we have yet to see our waitress or a menu. At this point in time its about 1015-1030pm they are not jam packed to a point where the waitress could just be busy at the time.  

I think the part that frustrated me the most, was that when we seen the hostess, we flagged her down and asked her if we were going to have a waitress come check on us and bring us menus. And then the hostess looked completely clueless and not so motivated to help us. As if asking for a waitress was taboo. 

When our waitress finally came we all knew what we wanted it within the next five or ten minutes. We placed our order, drinks came out fast and the food wasn't too far behind. So the previous debacle kind of blew over and we didn't think too much of it. But then our next issue came about, when we were ready to leave we noticed that our waitress hadn't checked up on us in a while.  So we eventually seen another waitress walk by and she was very helpful to us with closing our tab. 

So ultimately I don't know if our original waitress left early or what?! I just thought that was a little unprofessional. On our way out, the \"clueless\" hostess had her feet up on the table and she didn't really seem to care about her job, I guess it's just a little things."}
{"text":"Copper blues in Phoenix is amazing. Tempe location has terrible service. It was 15 minutes before anyone even said hello or brought waters. Took another 20 minutes just to get our beers.. And they mixed up mine and my boyfriends order. We went with the intention of having several drinks each but it took so long to get any type of service that we couldn't order more rounds. Food was good, atmosphere is good but the service is just terrible."}
{"text":"I'm glad Copper Blues opened in Tempe. I've always enjoyed myself at the downtown location and they have great happy hour prices. Since I don't work downtown anymore, it's a pain driving there and finding parking. Plus, Tempe is much close for me. 

CB has great beer selections, awesome happy hours prices, and good bands. Where they lack is service (at both locations). I guess you can't be good at everything, or can you? Is that too much to ask? I think not. Either they're short staffed, or the skill level amongst the staff is less than average. 

Last night's bartender was less than average, hands down. It wasn't because they were short staffed, there were only about 10 ppl in the entire place. The bartender was more concerned about cutting lemons than serving customers. She seemed better working behind the scenes than on the front line. She didn't bother washing her hands between washing glasses, cutting lemons, pouring beer and serving food. I don't think she even wiped her hands once. 

I suppose CB is just hoping that you won't notice the lack of service much once the beer hits your system and the band is jamming. Like I said before, I've always had a good time...because of the company and good music. Since the band hadn't started playing last night, the lack of service was very noticeable . Hence the 3 stars. 

I really hope CB improves on their service. It's a fun place otherwise."}
{"text":"Went to go and they are closed till December with no notice on their website or here... Sad."}
{"text":"Saturday night at 6:00 before a show at the Improv. First warning sign, no hostess. Second, angry patrons start to leave. Third, bartender informs us she is the only employee. Come to the bar to order. Doesn't ask for any food order, not sure they even have any. Why even open if you can't serve?  We will eat before we come for a show next time."}
