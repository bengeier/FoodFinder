{"text":"In town for a race, best food I've had in a long time! if you love bacon this is the place for you. If you are a local or on the road definitely make a point to stop in."}
{"text":"Great food! Everything has bacon in or on it! What's not to like ??? Sorry if your Muslim or Jewish...... Awsome burger. Awsome bacon.  Should asked why their bacon is so tasty not like store bought I guarantee you.  Bad for them their location really sucks, first it's in kannapolis and its hidden in kannapolis."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and delicious!! Bacon, bacon, bacon! I had the homemade chicken salad in a tortilla wrap, then wrapped in bacon. Bacon is was *crispy* and hot, while the chicken salad stayed cold. It was amazing!!! We took a piece of candied bacon peanut butter fudge to go. What is not to love?"}
{"text":"Places like Crispy's are why I love Yelp. Found this place on a trip through town. Easy to get to from the highway and worth a stop. BACON is everywhere and it is FANTASTIC! Definitely try the bacon wrapped cheese sticks and the steak and cheese (also wrapped in bacon)."}
{"text":"Such great food! Was in the area taking the dog tot he vet and popped in! If you love bacon you will love it here! Husband had the nachos and wings and I had the daily special grilled chicken sandwich!! All were AMAZING! Will def visit again while in the  area! Staff was very friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Good beers on tap, nice decor, friendly owner and menu centered around bacon. How could you not like this place? Great addition to Concord restaurant scene."}
{"text":"Walked in at noon and were greeted and sat immediately. Our waitress came right away, got our drinks and answered several questions before taking our order. She was exceptionally pleasant and helpful. I had a bacon encrusted flounder sandwich with homemade waffle chips and slaw. The flounder and chips were both unusual and delicious. My wife had the \"Crabby Patty\" which she loved and a side of fruit that was varied and fresh.

If you are a bacon lover, you will love this place. If you are not a bacon lover, you will probably become one!"}
{"text":"Two words...Holy Crap!  If you're on a diet, don't go there. If you like food, this place is for you.  This is the kind of place that makes you eat until you can't breath....and then eat more ci it's just too damn good to stop. Opened by the people who do the Masterbacon food truck."}
{"text":"Creative menu and  something different, especially for Concord.  The beer selection is good.  At the risk of sounding snobby...Craft beer in an exceptionally small PLASTIC cup was a bit disappointing.....Especially for the price.  It felt a little insulting in a way.  Don't get me wrong, the owners are doing something cool and creative here.  If I was making  suggestions (which I guess I am) I would recommend beer being served in a proper pint glass.  Also, understanding the Bacon concept and as a bacon lover myself...Just a few more Non-Bacon options so that I can successfully get a group of Non bacon eaters to come with me."}
{"text":"The food was excellent!  I had the wings and the BLT.  The staff were attentive and friendly. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food is awesome! I wish the bar was a bit more welcoming. You're basically sitting in the kitchen where everything is prepared."}
{"text":"The food is very over priced for the portion size and quality. We had chicken wings and these were the smallest wings i have ever seen. A $3 side of potato wedges literally had 6 pieces of potato in it and the $12 order of Nachos were all piled in a disposable \"boat\" and completely covered in beans. It was so bad we sent it back and tried something else. The waffle chicken crispers were no better. Looked like a small boat of frozen chicken strips that were way over fried. The owner came around asking how things were so we told him what we thought of the food. He acted as if he could care less and basically just turned around and walked off. We will not be returning for a 2nd visit."}
{"text":"Great menu and great service.  Family owned and a genuinely fresh menu that you have never had anywhere else."}
{"text":"Southwest eggrolls, Monte Crisco, and Pecan pie ice cream.They were all AWESOME! Suprisingly the food was not greasy. Bacon was crispy and not too thick. The staff was attentive and service was fast. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I am glad it is gaining popularity. I have had probably 12 different entrees and loved them all. The owner talks to each and every table, and might sit with you for a few minutes to make sure you like your food. If you love bacon, this is your place. If you don't like bacon, they have options for you, too, but ask yourself 'am I human?' 

The owner and cooks usually have a daily special that they've come up with, and that's usually what I get, and every time I've gotten the special, I wish it was a regular menu item, because it is so tasty. They've become very inventive with how they incorporate bacon into things. I do have my favorite menu items (chicken and waffle sandwich, bacon bombs, nachos, bacon wrapped chicken salad sandwich, sweet potato wedges, etc.) but usually their special tops them all and keeps things interesting and makes me come back.

Decent local draft beer, but have noticed they never have beer specials (or at least I've never heard a waitress mention specials). I typically do not order beer because of this, since I could buy a six pack at Harris Teeter or Lowe's Foods of what they serve for the same price of two draft beers.

See you guys soon!"}
{"text":"Service was very good and the food was delightful with nice portions for the money. Would suggest you make it stop"}
{"text":"Think of your favorite food...these guys find a way to incorporate bacon and make it even better, including desserts! Amazing food, fun, friendly staff. Must check it out if within 50 miles of this place."}
{"text":"The bacon wrapped southwest rolls are amazing! I always try something different when I go and have never been disappointed. I am sad that they no longer have a food truck, but happy the restaurant is close by. Please, please jar and sell the pickles! They are so good!"}
{"text":"Good food cold beer,  and great waitstaff.  Not much else to ask for when eating out.  Maybe daily drink specials."}
{"text":"Owner of Master Bacon food truck opened a restaurant!  Pork belly Nachos, bacon cheeseburger, Gouda and bacon mac and cheese and Gouda pork belly grilled cheese didn't disappoint. You need to check this place out."}
{"text":"How can anything wrapped in bacon ever be wrong? It can't lol. If you love bacon, this is the place for you. Stopped by here to grab a carry out on my way home. I tried the bacon wrapped southwestern egg rolls and a side of bacon mac n cheese. Both were excellent! Staff was friendly and the bathrooms were the cleanest I have seen in awhile."}
{"text":"Came in on a busy Friday night.  We tried the bbq pork belly sandwich!  It is wonderful.  The appetizers are deep fried heaven."}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype! Sundays they're open until 2pm, and have brunch specials which are great. This place should be sponsored by Lipitor, it's not healthy by any stretch of the imagination but if your ok with not getting your cholesterol check for a month or two this place is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great food!!!! Bacon, bacon, bacon! If you love bacon you can't go wrong with this place. The food and people are excellent, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had heard about Crispys and seen the reviews on Yelp, and definitely wanted to give it a try! Lucky this weekend I was able to give it a chance!

From the moment we opened the door you could smell it, the wonderful aroma of bacon! We were promptly seated and the waitresses were very pleasant. The restaurant was smaller than I was expecting, but has some nice bar seats right at the kitchen area, as well as a pretty large patio for the warmer months.

We were eating on a Sunday, when you can order off of the regular menu, but they also have a special brunch menu.  While we ordered from the regular menu I would like to go back sometime and try one of the special quiches that we were told change each week.  As anyone can probably tell from reading the Yelp reviews, obviously bacon is the specialty here!  As hard as it is to admit, while I like bacon (who doesn't like bacon?), it isn't something that I want all over everything and all that I want to taste.  And, to me, Crispys gets it right walking line between \"just enough\" and \"too much\". While just about every item on the menu has bacon in it, most of them have it as a topping, or a compliment to the main ingredients which works very well!

I got the bacon wrapped hot dog with the ranch seasoned potato wedges.  The hot dog was HUGE and I loved that it was served on a toasted piece of bread.  I was not the biggest fan of the potato wedges, they just had a little too much seasoning for me, but that is a great idea.  My girlfriend ordered the chicken and waffle sandwich and really enjoyed it.  She also ordered the homemade chips, which are a waffle style, and I liked those a lot more than my potato wedges, personally.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Crispys and would definitely like to try some of the other items on the menu. If you are in the mood for some bacon, give it a try!"}
{"text":"This is the place for bacon lovers! Menu full of bacon offerings. I ordered the chicken salad, which was of very high quality ingredients, but needed salt.  All dressings were made in house and were great. I really give them credit for serving fresh food and would return."}
{"text":"Just passing thru and got lucky. Outstanding food and service. This will be a scheduled stop on my next trip."}
{"text":"So happy we took a chance on a new place. Great food. KC enjoyed bacon-wrapped steak wrap. Bacon-wrapped cheese sticks were good. Very flexible for personal needs and likes."}
{"text":"Awesome, crazy, bacon-themed food.  Been here twice now, and Crispy's always delivers!"}
{"text":"This is a really cool place which revolves around bacon in most every menu item and most sauces are made in house. The staff is really friendly and the food is really good. They serve wine and beer as well. The place is pretty small and I wish they had some more options but overall this is a great local spot."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and great staff!  Come hungry!  We ate so much but had no room for dessert.  They have Sundrop in the fountain drinks by the way."}
{"text":"So, I went here last night not really knowing what to expect.  I saw some of the item descriptions on Yelp and wasn't sure if they could pull it off... but I went and decided to go with an \"All APP\" meal.

I got one of the \"Buffalo Bacon Bombs\", a \"Bacon Wrapped Southwestern Chicken Eggroll\", the \"Bacon Wrapped Crab Stuffed Shrimp\" and finished it off with the \"Crispy Chik'n Waffle Crispers\".

The Buffalo bacon bombs are a hard boiled egg wrapped in bacon, deep fried, and tossed in homemade Buffalo Sauce.  This is the kind of thing I could see trying on a dare when intoxicated, but sober, these are freaking amazing I actually came back tonight and these are what I ordered again....2 tonight.  (I hate hard boiled eggs BTW)

The  eggrolls were very tasty dish. The \"roll\" of the egg roll was not as crispy as I would like, but it was perfectly cooked, tender, and the flavors combined with the bacon and the sauce were excellent.

The bacon wrapped crab/shrimp was definitely not like any other.  The crab filling added a very nice flavor, and enhances the texture. Deep frying the bacon cooked the shrimp to perfection, and the sauce he puts on it is excellent. These are an app, but they could definitely be a meal (if you ordered 2 or 3)

And that brings me to the chick'n waffle crispers.  By the description, I didn't think I would like them, but it was more of a curiosity. They are chicken tenderloins dipped in waffle batter.  they are then deep fried and as a sauce they give syrup.  So it came out, and they were the best looking chicken tenders I'd ever seen.  They were golden Brown, big, and there was a lot of them.  almost a meal by themselves.  The syrup was excellent, but a little too sweet for me so I took their home-made honey mustard and mixed it with their (also homemade) siracha  barbecue sauce.    Score.

I came in tonight with full intention of getting  crispers, and either 2 other apps or one of the sandwiches.......but, I ran into The daily specials menu on the way in and I was done.

Are you freaking kidding me?  if this sandwich was a hotel/resort, it would be like \"A golf course on the Hawaiian shore with a scuba shop, cheerleader training school, a monster truck course, world class sailing, free massages, and no sunburns or hangovers\".  

(see pic of the special board)   

It's pulled pork belly on Angus beef with bacon, carmelized mushrooms and onions, with Gouda cheese spread on perfectly toasted sourdough bread.......with a side (gouda mac and cheese topped with, you guessed it, bacon crumbles).

There is a definite bacon theme going on here, but the way that owner/chef pairs that with the food is thusfar, flawless.  Some of the very interesting things he offers definitely make it worth several visits.  This would be a great place for lunch as the prices are reasonable, and the portions are pretty big for the cost.  highly recommended for a bigger group, and sharing.  so many things to try.

the servers are friendly, m the service is very attentive, and the food comes out crazy fast.  this would definitely be one of my hangout places if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"If you like bacon, this place is a five.  Found it on Yelp as we headed North from GA.  Was a bit skeptical when we first walked in, but, for what it is, it was great.  Had the incredible BLT with homemade chips and ranch.  Very friendly."}
{"text":"Dear GAWD! I just left Crispy's, and I don't think I'll be eating again for a few days! So good, but if you're a bacon addict like I am, be careful! It's easy to overindulge. 

Where do I begin...We had the bacon wrapped cheese sticks and crab stuffed shrimp, and the cheese sticks were INSANE! Then my husband had the Cuban sandwich, and I had the Piggy Panini and a cup of tomato soup. All of the above were superb. 

As if that wasn't enough, we ordered all three of the desserts to try...Cheesecake, Reece's PB brownies and pound cake--ALL wrapped in bacon of course! 

Now I'm sitting in the car while my husband is at the Harbor Freight Tools around the corner only because I'm not entirely sure I can unfold myself into a standing position just yet. But it's a good full, a happy full, an I'll-be-back-after-I-spend-some-time-on-the-elliptical full!

Great find. You bacoholics won't be sorry!!!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool dive, definitely worth checking out. I landed on 4 stars even though if I were grading specifically based on our meal I would have gone 3 stars. Based though on the solid menu options, and quality of service, I think 4 is appropriate as I'm guessing some of the other items may be better than what I ordered. 

The southwest egg rolls were quite tasty. The bacon could have been crispier, and a side of the ranch rather than a drizzle would have been good. 

The side mac and cheese with bacon was fantastic, but my buffalo chicken grilled cheese sounded better than it's actual execution. 

They offer a load of outstanding desert options, but we did not have time to indulge. I'll definitely try  Crispy's again in hopes of finding a option that is a home run."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a friendly neighborhood hamburger and sandwich spot this is the place. The staff is extremely friendly and the menu is extensive with a preference for bacon. The sweet potato wedges are good and sweet enough to be dessert. Next time I'm going to try the ranch fries. They looked yummy. I commend the owner and staff on offering far more than expected. We will be back."}
{"text":"Of course it was great, almost everything had bacon.  Thursday night dinner for 4, they sat quickly and the food frenzy began.  Our server was attentive with great advice.  We had bacon wrapped cheese sticks, buffalo wings, chicken in waffle batter (get the maple syrup), house chips, grilled cheese and mac and cheese. Everything was fresh, hot delicious and plentiful. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Had a small miscommunication during my first visit however the owner reached out to me personally and fixed it. I got the bacon wrapped burger with mac n cheese and bacon wrapped cheese sticks. Everything was delicious and the owner went out of his way to make sure i enjoyed the food. Highly recommend this place, the staff and food are excellent."}
{"text":"I had high hopes, but was a bit let down. I had a bacon burger. The burger was definitely not fresh. More like a Bubba burger and I thought the bacon was tough and hard to chew. The waffle ships were good though and my fav part of the meal. My boyfriend had the Cuban which he said was just ok because they grilled the bread. He was expecting soft bread and the grilled bread ruined it for him. He said the pork rinds were good. Good sweat tea. 
I didn't have anything good enough to make me want to come back."}
{"text":"When we knew we were coming to North Carolina for a family wedding, I didn't want to eat at a bunch of chain restaurants that you can eat at anywhere.  I asked for recommendations and my niece, a local, suggested this fine restaurant.  My only criticism is that you should expand it and make it bigger for more people to enjoy.  We had amazing service, with an incredibly friendly and helpful waitress, wonderful food.  I especially loved the fresh pork rinds... they were totally worth it.  They let our noisy family close down the joint and didn't make us feel rushed.  Thank you so much for a fun, bacon filled experience.  Crispy's did not disappoint!!!"}
{"text":"well, when you first see the menu you have to wonder how many times the waitstaff hears \"Do you have anything without bacon on it?\".  Or the smartass line of \"Do you guys have bacon?\"  Either way - they do and it's damn good!  We had the Buffalo Chicken sandwich with bacon and the Crab Cake Sandwich wrapped in bacon.   Our sides were the potato wedges and the Mac N Cheese (sans bacon).  The server was friendly, the food was quick, hot and delicious...a great experience all the way around.
Great spot tucked in a bit of a tough location from a noise standpoint, but the outside patio was still a great spot to have a good meal"}
{"text":"Bacon lovers unite because Crispy's Bar and Grill is the perfect place for you.

You'll find bacon in almost everything, like bacon wrapped hot dogs and thick cut bacon in sandwiches. It's every carnivore's dream and the menu is variable enough that you'll have a hard time selecting just one item instead of several. The restaurant itself is extremely quirky with all of the bacon paraphernalia. Red bar stools and wooden booths are plentiful inside and there are tables for outside seating as well. It's a great place to come by and hang out.

The servers at Crispy's Bar and Grill are unbelievably kind and attentive. Their charisma and the sincerity in their service really made it obvious how much they love both their job and the food they serve. Absolutely phenomenal people!  

Even though I'm just as big of a fan of bacon as the next person, the Crispy's Crabby Patty sounded too amazing to pass up. Every sandwich also came with a side and for mine I selected mixed fruit.

The sandwich was gigantic and the crabby patty was deliciously thick and juicy. The word \"sandwich,\" however, is a tad bit misleading because this was more like a crabby patty burger. I had to cut my burger in half because it was just way too big for me to bite into, but when I sliced it down the middle, the filling stayed neatly stacked and didn't ooze out. The patty is definitely made with fresh real crab that smelled divine. The crab meat was a tad bit on the salty side, but the fresh vegetables helped to balance it out. The one criticism I would make is that the texture of the whole burger was a bit too mushy. I would have preferred the crabby patty to have a nice crunch on the outside. 

The mixed fruit consisted of juicy pineapples, sweet honeydew, and slightly tart strawberries. They were the perfect thing to have to cleanse the palate. Some papaya pieces still had the rind, so I was unable to eat those.

I know it's strange that I came to a bacon restaurant and didn't order a bacon entree, but my crabby patty serves as proof that Crispy's isn't some one trick pony. Of course if I ever come back to North Carolina, Crispy's, much like bacon, is definitely on the menu."}
{"text":"The service is excellent,  the Chef \"Greg Helmandollar\" is very versed in fine cuisine and has really outdone himself with the menu. I was very pleased with everything! Friendly atmosphere, happy and friendly staff to. I highly recommend this place for any family outing. You will be pleased and the food is exceptional and reasonably priced!!!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. Came in from out of town for work and wanted to try something different. This is a bacon lovers dream. The bacon wrapped steak wrap is delicious. I can't wait for my next trip down to the area to try the pork belly nachos."}
{"text":"Bacon!  I had a Buffalo Bacon Bomb, which is bacon wrapped around a boiled egg and then deep fried and coated with Buffalo Wing sauce.  Yum!  Plus I had the Piggy Panini, bacon and ham and other stuff on sourdough bread. Delicious!  Great place to get your bacon on!"}
{"text":"Great good nice place.litlle pricey but u get good foodmi had burger and was impressed"}
{"text":"Wasnt really impressed i ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich it comes out its on flat bread and no bacon to be found anywhere so i just scratched my head i tried it to be buffalo the sauce was very sweet maybe it was just me but nothing like i was expecting"}
{"text":"Bacon  lovers watch out everything you could have ever dreamed is here. The staff was super great and helpful with recommendations. Oh and as a pastry chef Dessert with Bacon  is a WIN!no matter what! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"A relative brought us here when I wanted something \"local\".  WOW.

Definitely a hole-in-the-wall vibe, with family waitstaff who know my host.  I had dinner and didn't really realize it was a bar - to me it seemed like just a sandwich dive.

And what a dive.  Deep-fried or bacon-wrapped your cup of tea?  Here you go. 

I hadn't eaten all day, and was tired.  I thought I ordered the goudazetti grilled cheese, but must have selected the piggy panini instead.  It was delicious, even with a red pepper spread I wasn't expecting and which was spicier than I would have ordered.  Spouse ordered the BLT and it was wonderful.  I like that they use spinach instead of lettuce, but that makes me wonder how the sandwich can be called a \"BLT\".

And dinner was inexpensive.  This place will definitely be on our \"visit again\" list when we're in the area."}
{"text":"This place focuses on bacon dishes, but in a balanced way.  Pork belly was shredded and juicy. Bacon on top of pork belly is heaven.

Smallish place with extra seating outside.

Not a sports bar place, a single tv.  This is fine for me though."}
{"text":"Loved this place. They had great staff, the food was great. They guys loved the beer. We really enjoyed ourselves. We definitely would be back and I recommend it. It was just four of us adults here on a weekend away. We had a great time and were glad to find them open later as most places seemed closed at 8 or 9."}
{"text":"If you like BACON this is the place... Food is really good, local produce from the patio lol and good decor inside. Crabby patty was great as was the Artisian sandwich. Good for the family of all ages with a sprinkle of bacon on top... Maybe a Guy Fieri nominee..."}
{"text":"Burger was great. Grilled cheese with bacon and egg was great. Bacon wrapped pot roast special was great. Beverage service was slow. When your food arrives before your beer, that's not good service. We sat outside. Nice patio. But I felt kind of forgotten by our server. We'll be back. We'll just sit inside. 
Returned tonight 8/5/17. Sat inside. Had great food and excellent service."}
{"text":"Do you like bacon??  If you do this is the place for you.  Nearly every dish has bacon in it, on it, or incorporated into it.  I had the bacon wrapped cheese sticks.  They were excellent.  I also had the buffalo chicken sandwich (of course it had bacon in it too!) and it was very good as well, and a bit messy but that's ok. As my side I had the house chips and my goodness!!  They were thin cut waffle chips with homemade ranch and I've never had chips better than this.

So if you're in the area come on by you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome little gem in Kannapolis. They put bacon on just about everything. I had the bacon wrapped jumbo deep fried pickle... And fresh made pork rinds. Unbelievably cool place. A couple nice craft beers on tap and the wait staff are friendly southern girls that really care. I had to try the deep fried bacon wrapped hard boiled egg, tossed in buffalo sauce... Delicious."}
{"text":"If you love bacon you'll love this place. They have bacon inspired everything!! It's so good. I never even knew it was there until someone told me about it. They also have a food truck If I'm not mistaken. Pretty sure I smelled like bacon when I left ? but I wasn't mad about it."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for date night.  We had the Egg rolls, Goudazhell Grilled Cheese with egg, and then Bellydamgoud Grilled Cheese.  All of this food was really good and I would def. get each of these items again. My sweet potato was solid but not the best one I have ever had.  They serve local beers like Cabarrus Brew and NODA.
Will def. be back with other family and friends."}
{"text":"Between me and my husband we have had everything on the menu and a lot of the weekend specials. We have never had a bad meal. It has always been wonderful along with the desserts and the Sunday brunch. There is something for everyone as my husbands little sister does not like bacon but has been with us a couple times and always finds something that she can eat and loves. This is one of our favorite places in the Concord area!"}
{"text":"This place is like no other! Bacon bacon bacon! I had the bacon wrapped homemade chicken salad, it was really good. Now I'm not crazy about bacon but my boyfriend is. He had the bacon wrapped Philly cheesesteak and I honestly thought I saw a tear come to his eye and he said it was best sandwich he had ever eaten. I took a bite and I have to say it was delicious, the hint of horseradish is what made the sandwich for me I think. It's just something about that sandwich. Pork rinds were good too, but I think they need to create a signature dipping sauce there to serve with them."}
{"text":"A Bacon Themed Restaurant? Yes Please!

Saying it's Bacon Themed may be taking it too far, but they definitely love cooking pork.

I got the BLT, and it was amazing.  Really Really good. The bacon was perfectly cooked so as not to be too crunchy or to chewy.  The pressed the sandwich as well which makes it easier to eat.

I ordered the house made pork rinds, and this was perhaps my only negative on my experience. They tasted fine, but no better than pork rinds from a bag.  I should have tried one of the many other side dishes they offer.

The bill was very reasonable and the service was fast.  My waitress talked to me about the menu for a few minutes and was very friendly.

I will definitely ready here again for lunch."}
{"text":"Just dumb luck that I happened to be stopping in Kannapolis. Fired up Yelp and was immediately drawn to a restaurant advertising so much Bacon! This place exemplifies the beauty of Yelp, what a great find. I was on a roadtrip by myself, so sat at the bar. All the staff were friendly and determined for me to have an awesome meal. I think they took it as a personal insult that this mid-Atlantic girl had never had pecan pie and so they gave me a small taste of their now TV-famous bacon-wrapped pie. I was too full for a full slice, but damn it was good: perfect balance of salty and sweet. The patron next to me highly advised I try a \"bomb\" which was a bacon wrapped hard-boiled egg: deep fried of course. It was good, but a little strange for me. Still I'm glad I tried it. I wasn't sure what to have for the main meal, but the waitress and chef/owner pointed me towards a steak and cheese tortilla wrap that I was very skeptical of, but it turned out to be amazing. I meant to take a picture of it,  but it came out all crispy and wrapped in bacon and my brain could not focus on taking a picture. They seemed to have some interesting beers on tap, but as a cider person I would've loved to have seen a cider outside of Angry Orchard. But that was my only complaint, and it's minor at best. Two ciders, a bomb, and a steak and cheese sandwich all for $30 including a tip. That's pretty good in my book. 

If you are in the area and a lover of bacon, check this place out."}
{"text":"OMG - I have died & gone to heaven. Everything has bacon, even the cookie! Have eaten here many times. Small, quaint diner. Very friendly staff. If I am near here at lunch, this is always my first choice. Great prices."}
{"text":"The food concept is unique, but not well executed.  The bacon was totally flavorless, so it was pointless and a huge disappointment. The sriracha ranch, which sounds delicious, had an odd tang to it that seemed like it was not fresh. The pork rinds were good, but again, the flavor on them was just...off. I was really prepared to be impressed and really was underwhelmed by the entire visit to the food truck and then to the restaurant on a different day. The service was fine, a little slow on refills but not horrible, and they were very nice."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident and couldn't wait to come back. As a die hard bacon lover this is now one of my favorite spots. They make everything to order in house and even have BACON DESSERTS! Look for their daily specials board outside for an extra dose of mouthwatering bacon goodness."}
{"text":"So good and so different...definitely worth a try. But beware bacon is in every dish and so yummy!"}
{"text":"My son and I came here for lunch.  One
Of the few places in the area with mostly 5-star ratings.  I can see why.  Great service and how can a place that has bacon-wrapped chili-cheese dogs on the menu be anything but perfect! Imagine a southwestern egg roll wrapped in bacon with sriracha ranch sauce... and then order it as an appetizer! I love this place!"}
{"text":"My family and I love this cozy spot in Kannapolis, we have followed them since they had their first food truck, Prices, atmosphere, and staff are wonderful."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here. All I can is WOW! Had the bacon wrapped cheese steak. The meal was amazing and the portion size was plenty! We substituted the horseradish for the siracha ranch and it was just amazing. Certainly couldn't eat here every day for health reasons but it was an amazing cheat meal.

Our server Dana was excellent too. Kept water refilled and made great recommendations. We are in town for business but if back I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what the rave is. Maybe I just don't like bacon on everything like everyone else does but this place could use a little variety..."}
{"text":"If bacon is your jam, this is where you wanna be.  Comforting flavor profiles, with a touch of execution.  Great service and staff!"}
{"text":"Such a cool place. Super friendly staff all around and a really great menu. Service was terrific the two times we've been so far. And the food is just ridiculously good. Like, you'll end up coming back twice in one week -- which is what we did! Great for families, too! This isn't your typical bar and grill. It feels like a family place. My kids loved the fish tank and the food! Oh, and the craft beer selection is on point, too. They have Wicked Weed cans - I'd give them a bonus star just for that! Try this place out and support a great local business!!!"}
{"text":"If you love bacon this is the only place to be great food and beer had the burger and pork rinds you got to get the pork rinds"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Great people. Our whole family loves this place.  Try the mozzerella sticks and ask for dessert!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service! The staff is friendly and the owner Greg is always there to say hello! Don't miss the Pork Rinds, they are AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Bacon Heaven!  Service and food were exceptional.  Good thing I don't live here, I would eat here everyday."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday for the first time it was on Food paradise so of course had to try it.  My date got a bacon steak wrap and I got a BLT(which is simple but it was the best BLT I ever had. We both tried a \"bomb\" which is the hard boiled egg wrapped in bacon dipped in buffalo sauce and we were in HEAVEN.  The cook was also trying out a new recipe that wasn't on the menu that we got to try.  It was sweet potato pecan casserole and he did something right because that was like the desert we needed to top off the meal! Our waiter had red hair and a mullet I can't remember his name but he had us laughing so hard and was very friendly.  It was a nice comfortable environment! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Everything has bacon. I mean everything. Know that before you come in. Great little cafe atmosphere, with brown paper table cloths and great service. Food was great. I had the pork belly BBQ sandwich (with bacon, of course) and the sweet potato wedges (cooked perfectly). Home made BBQ sauce was sweet and with a little bite, but not too spicy. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Love this place. We eat here a lot. We have tried everything. We have enjoyed all the food, and have new favorites every time we come here. Grandson love all the bacon deserts."}
{"text":"We pass this place all the time and finally stopped in for a late lunch. The place was empty(but it was 230). The menu definitely says it all, BACON! Everything on the menu had some kind of pork or bacon, even the ice cream. I am not complaining, I'm just describing heaven! Our server was Dana and she was awesome! We told her it was our first time and she walked us through the menu from starters to desserts. They also have a pretty good beer selection, but we stuck to sweet tea. They started as a food truck and then got this location in Concord which also does takeout. We will all most certainly back =) 
For the two of us between drinks, an appetizer, 2 meals and a dessert we spent 30bucks! And needed boxes, cause it was a lot of food!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place to go! We are there at least once a week. Great food for not alot of money. Great wait staff we're there so often that as soon as we walk in the door they know our drink order and where we always sit. Sunday brunch is always good especially when you order off of the brunch menu!"}
{"text":"They just plain rock!!! The food and ideas that they make are just straight up masterpieces!! One of my absolute favorite places ever!! \"Keep it Crispy\""}
{"text":"I love the bacon bombs. They have to be the best thing I have ever eaten. We go there often and use to visit the food truck when it was at the brewery"}
{"text":"If you are a lover of all things bacon, Crispy's Bar and Grill should be your favorite destination.  As soon as you walk in you are hit with the sweet smell of fried bacon. I believe it is Pecan Smoked bacon which is awesome.
 
We have been fans of Master Bacon since we discovered them over a year ago and when we learned Greg was going to open a restaurant....we were in heaven. We live in Winston and tried to get down to try the fare at Crispy's.

I order the special which was Ruben with bacon. It was a classic Ruben with homemade pickles, smoked ham and lots of bacon. Of course I got an order of season pork rinds (yes, this is a side item). My fiancee got the Bacon Cheeseburger. She loved it.

As I said, if you love all things bacon, Crispy's should be on you favorite's list. We are fans (="}
{"text":"Went to Crispy's with some friends after work.  We tried a little of everything on the menu.  Wow, all the food was simply incredible (especially if you like bacon), so I ordered more to take home to my wife.  The home made pork skins are really great also, and you can get a whole bag of them to take along.  If you get the chance, you must try out this place."}
{"text":"It was ok. I expected much more bacon options. Ordered Mac and cheese. Throw some bacon in it. It was just ok nothing special."}
{"text":"This place is special! The owner used to be the executive chef at Mickey and Mooch. That says a lot. The food is creative and so interesting. This isn't your typical fare. I agree with the other reviewer. This isn't a place you to to stick to a diet. This is food lovers paradise! BACON BACON BACON! Bellydamngouda sandwich is so delicious! I hope they get the support they deserve, because Concord/Kannapolis is seriously lacking in quality restaurants."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. Bacon. Lots and lots of bacon. I can't even think enough to type this review because of my bacon coma. 

The best shrimp and grits I've had. The shrimp were HUGE and wrapped in shrimp. Hubby had a smoked brisket sandwich which was indescribable. It was smoked very subtly in an aged whiskey barrel. The brisket melted in your mouth. 

We will definitely be adding this place to our list of regular joints!"}
{"text":"Bacon smell from the second you walk in the door... It's wonderful.  Staff is very friendly. Our waiter was very nice and he took the time to show my 4 year old son the baby shark in their fish tank and tell him about the other things in the fish tank. Very nice of him! Bacon chicken alfredo pasta was delicious. Bread that comes with it was good too. Nice outdoor patio seating/dining area if you want to eat outside. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Good food good beer...Awesome owners and Staff!! Bacon southwestern egg rolls my fave!!!!!"}
{"text":"A vegan's nightmare.  Bacon bacon and more bacon.  Deep fried hot dog is a must try.  Panini's are a healthier choice and just as delicious.   Friendly staff and a nice selections of craft beer.   Well worth a visit"}
{"text":"TGFY! Thank goodness for Yelp, we never would have found this place.

Fact: Bacon makes everything better!

We started with the southwest egg rolls. They were very good. I do wish they had a better crisp to them and came with a side of ranch. Still, they were tasty with great flavor.

I ordered the special of the day which was basically a chicken parm sandwich with bacon. For my side I ordered sweet potato wedges. Our server endorsed these items and did not disappoint.

Hubby ordered the buffalo chicken and bacon sandwich with Mac and cheese. Holy moly. Everything here was great.

Healthy? Nope. But you come here for flavor and creative dishes and they don't disappoint. We most certainly will be back. What a gem of a place!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I went here for lunch. The food was delicious and the waitress was really knowledgeable and friendly. What great bacon combinations!! Yum! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is the best place I have ever eaten at! I wanted some bacon for breakfast... Bacon nachos, bacon wrapped surf & turf, bacon salad, bacon wrapped pecan pie with maple bacon ice-cream, etc..."}
{"text":"What a great surprise!! great menu selection .... get the sweet potato wedges!  Local restaurant and a nice change from the chains."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.   All of the dishes were very creative.   We were from out of town and will be back again."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwich and service. The portions are large and all include BACON. Oh my.... hitting the gym hard tonight. Well worth it though. I will be back!!I"}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick bite, it was very very good.  Waffle battered chicken strips, yum!!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on the Travel channel Saturday morning and I was seated at a table in this place by Saturday afternoon!! 

We were greeted as soon as we walked in and only had a short wait (10-15 mins). There's a decent selection of local brews and if you're not sure just ask for a sample (1-3 acceptable, lol don't go sample crazy). 

The main attraction of this place (and why it was on Travel network) is that you can get things wrapped in BACON!!! The cheesesteak sandwich is a local favorite but there are plenty of other sandwiches you can try. If there is someone in your party that just wants a wrap (without bacon) then that's fine also, again just ask. I tried the Mother Cluck'n Chicken Salad Sandwich, which is originally sold as a regular sandwich but I opted to get it as a melt wrapped in bacon! IT WAS AH-MAZING!!! The serving size of the sandwich and side appears like a lunch serving, but it's more than enough. 

Overall, this Kannapolis gem was worth the 30-minute drive! I will be back! I encourage anyone in the Charlotte or Concord area to try this place out (not all at once though, lol)."}
{"text":"Anything Bacon is awesome!

And everything on their menu had bacon... how awesome is that!

Being my first time here, I chose the bacon wrapped steak-and-bacon-cheddar wrap and my wife had the Southwestern Salad. Mine was fabulous but her salad was only head lettuce (tip - request all romaine). 

Craft beers were great too. 

Next visit, I will get the bacon-wrapped shrimp and grits. It sounds really good!"}
{"text":"Convenient location next to our hotel. I ordered the steak wrap with Mac and cheese. It was absolutely delicious! All of their menu items include bacon so I don't think you could make a bad choice! Staff was very helpful and able to easily make our order for take out."}
