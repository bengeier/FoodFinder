{"text":"Good selection for toppings, except the gummy worms were VERY hard. Good thing I only put on two. Also the actual yogurt selection was sort of weird? The flavor they offered weren't appealing at all. Other than that the place looked pretty clean and the one cashier I talked to was nice. I'll definitely try something different next time I come out to LV! So two stars for the hard toppings and weird flavors."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out this place basically because of the cookie dough scoops... we got there and she was making a crepe for another customer and it looked mouth watering so we had to try that too. We had the chocolate chip cookie dough which was good but not amazing. Still worth the trip to try though! But the crepe was off the charts good! It was the banana, strawberry, Nutella one. So good! The lady was super sweet and friendly."}
{"text":"Worst frozen yoghurt I've ever had. It melted rather fast and the fruit was frozen, it was a waste of money, time and calories. The staff were having a conversation amongst themselves, ignored us and even forgot to give us a spoon. I'd give it a 0 rating if I could."}
{"text":"Taro tasted like chocolate. Regular vanilla was icy and tasted horrible. Can't understand how they mess up yogurt?For the first time in my life didn't finish my dessert. Overpriced at $15 for two yogurts"}
{"text":"At the time of my visit, Malenas was very empty, but very HUGE -- Nice frozen yogurt shop within The treasure island hotel \"casino floor\".

I ordered their plain tart frozen yogurt which you build yourself, i.e put the toppings you desire (huge selection) for about 10oz total @ $7.00

Tasted good, self service and price friendly."}
{"text":"There was not a lot of service here as I helped myself.  I was really happy with the flavors and just that they were there in the hotel.  With 115 degrees outside a FoYo was in order to cool off!  This was an excellent stop for a fabulous snack!"}
{"text":"Rude employees, and overpriced yogurt. Avoid this place and prevent dealing with snobby old ladies."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating dessert here.  I got a scope of strawberry ice cream, which was great. The staff suggested I try a nutty monkey crepe.  They were very nice so I did!  It was great.  I will definitely come back"}
{"text":"I am not sure why this place has such bad ratings here. It has 4 stars with 15 reviews on trip advisor and that seems closer to the mark to me. Aside from the high price (on the strip, no surprise) we had no big issues. 

We came here three times during our stay across the street and all of the flavors we tried were delicious. I couldn't get enough of the mango with boba things on it! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Dessert is always a good option late at night. This being on the lobby floor of the Treasure Island hotel made it convenient for us to get our sugar fix.
Their chocolate and butter pecan ice creams are tasty and about $3.50 for a single scoop. 
Their chocolate strawberries, not so much. The chocolate didn't really have that great of a taste so we were disappointed by that. And two for $3 wasn't that bad. You'd think a place in the hotel would be super expensive but luckily it wasn't too overpriced."}
{"text":"I don't even write negative reviews very often, but in this case I feel compelled. Worst froyo experience EVER, and believe me I've had a lot of them. The \"tart\" yogurt didn't have the light refreshing taste it should, instead resembled thick frozen sour milk. All of the fruit offered as toppings were either out of a can, or inedible looking. And the candy was stale and hard. My husband and I each chose the smaller cup, and only filled it half way. The total was $13.63. Outrageous, even for a tourist trap...and what's worse is it was so inedible we threw it in the trash. Wish I had gambled away that $13 instead, this place is awful."}
{"text":"Expensive and the quality is bad compare to yogurt land. Strawberry flavor was off and has a weird after taste. Will definitely not come back."}
{"text":"Yum! A good, simple froyo place at Treasure Island located on the first floor right before you hit the casino across from the Pizzeria. Froyo is $0.45 per ounce and has just as many toppings as Yogurtland. My favorite so far is the lychee and it's consistency is almost that of a sorbet. There's also no sugar added in these yogurts which makes it somewhat healthier. I do think there are fewer flavors than typically at Yogurtland.

They also have a variety of crepes and waffles and ice cream sandwiches that look great as well - definitely hoping to try some more. 

For the kids or for a somewhat guilt-free dessert this definitely isn't a bad option if you're staying here. Their menu for other items is also decently expansive so there can be something for everyone."}
{"text":"The flavored were all bad except lychee. Even the plain was bad... How does that even happen"}
{"text":"Too expensive; but who are we kidding? This is Vegas where they price gauge you. Froyo at $0.65 per ounce so you're going to end up with a very small cup of frozen yogurt if you want to keep the costs low. :) I think the froyo place inside Mirage is even more expensive at $0.79 per ounce so this place is actually cheap compared to Mirage. haha"}
{"text":"This place isn't as bad as all of these negative reviews claim..
I'm local and was very anxious to try their edible cookie dough. I wasn't that impressed with it, the taste wasn't horrible it just tasted like it had been sitting there for a while. I sampled all three flavors (choc. chip, peanut butter and jelly, & butter pecan) I went with a half scoop of chocolate chip because their full scoop is much larger than your typical scoop and would have been way too much to consume in my opinion. I also got a scoop of butter pecan in a cone.
They get an extra star because the staff was incredibly helpful on offering samples and their opinions on flavors, etc..
Their prices weren't as horrible as I'm reading they are but that's probably because I'm used to Vegas prices. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back but if I was ever inside of Treasure Island and craving something sweet, I'd return!"}
{"text":"Spent $7.49 on froyo and tossed in the trash after 2 bites. Why? Extremely nasty aftertaste, melted extremely quick, and flavors were off.

Do yourself a favor and don't come here. I wasted money and regret not having read any Yelp reviews before coming here. The other Yelpers are spot-on with their reviews."}
{"text":"So it was a hot day and I decided to grab some yogurt since I was In the area. From the outside it is very appealing and clean and well organized which is nice and inviting so why not stop right.... who can go wrong with yogurt....

Well it's a serve serve and it's by the ounce and has a topping bar so you can dress it up how you like. So I got the vanilla ( I know plain lol) and the $3 scoop of cookie dough because they say it's their signature and let's just say I was very underwhelmed. The cookie dough was soggy which I didn't even know was possible for yogurt and the vanilla had a weird after taste. The only thing that saves this place is you can dress up your yogurt anyway you want and it's really clean which is nice for a self serve place. 

Just know if you go here you will pay a premium for frozen yogurt but the product could be a lot better, I'm guessing that's why it's pretty empty. If it was around .35 a ounce it would be on par with the quality of the yogurt. I personally wouldn't Patronize this establishment again"}
{"text":"I came here specifically for the raw cookie dough even after reading the bad reviews to try it for myself. The reviews were accurate. It was terrible and went right in the garbage. Couldn't even eat it. It had a funny artificial taste and was not fresh or sweet and I've had my share of raw cookie dough. And the employee put it in the microwave which I thought was even more disgusting. A refund would have been nice! Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Allow me to take you on my \"Rude,Hurtful\" journey at this place! My husband and I are visiting for a reunion with some NAVY buddies from different states. We could have chosen another place,but they decide here.
So,after a busy day I decided that tonight I was going to order a Crepe from this shop located in Treasure Island. I proceed to head over and so excited(and hungry) and when I arrived there I saw 2 Caucasian men waiting for the lady who looked and acting so pissed off at the entire world. So right then I should have left but,NO! I felt I walked all the way here for this crepe and I was going to get it...wrong! This woman didn't greet anyone who entered and was just awful! I am now the only one still in line after the other 2 have been waited on and gone. In walks a  Caucasian couple wanting samples which pissed her off! Finally! I said mam! I am standing right here. I have been standing here for awhile without no acknowledgment! She says\"what do you want\"! Now I'm ready to whip this bitch ass! But! I want my damn crepe! I said I would like to order a crepe with strawberr... you notice I was cut the hell off! She says \"No! That takes too long and we close at 12! I said mam! It's 11:45!!!!!!!!!!! She said\"No! We start to shut down at 11:45 and close at 12\"! OMG! I was so damn mad I wanted to reach over and choke the shit out her rude old ass! Why in this day and time are people so damn awful to others? Why have a business that hire this type of person allow such behavior? Why even support such a business that think this is ok and except our hard earn money? Never again! I'm using this site to put their ass on \"Blast\"! Don't go pay somebody to be rude and unprofessional take a stand and allow rude workers to take their rude ass back home or go seek customer service training. Today,I'm told there is another place that sell fantastic crepes! Not only will I buy but \"Tip\" them generously also. So \"No Damn Stars\" for \"Rude Awful Service\"!"}
{"text":"The service at this place is poor because it was severely understaffed. One employee is running around trying to do everything at one time. Great job, management. I only came to kill time waiting for Mystere. This place is in a big hotel and you have one worker. Good job. One star for your level of intelligence. Proud of you."}
{"text":"The two stars go for the nice lady at the cash register and the clean interior. It was extremely over priced and I would opt for yogurt land instead. When I tried the flavors, they were very disappointing. The plain tart tasted extremely sour, more so than a tart is supposed to taste like. Maple syrup had an interesting flavor as well. The lychee flavor was the only good one. I wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"Worst of the worst froyo in the Milky way. Prices are very high..about 61 cents compared to 42 cents anywhere in the universe. I got red velvet and plain tart. Horrendous flavor and taste. Froyo is also watery and toppings are so so. Avoid this place !!"}
{"text":"We should have left the store when we saw the 1 star review but I saw mostly were due to the price and service and I thought we could live with that for once. 
Long story short, my boys got their yogurts and they shared with my husband.  2-3 hrs later, all 3 of them got stomachache and very bad diarrhea.  

Stay away from this store!!!!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why people are giving this place a bad rating. Don't knock it till you try it. Service, cleanliness and food was 100%!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were visiting Vegas for the weekend and ended up at Malena's. This place was such a let down. The shop had no ambiance and had limited flavor options. The frozen yogurt was grainy and pretty gross. We should have just found a McDonald's."}
{"text":"Frozen Yogurt - 3/5
Service - N/A
Greed Level - HIGH

I don't quite understand how a place where I pour the yogurt, top it myself can have the audacity to ask for a gratuity for someone who just rings me out?

The yogurt is fine. I had the raspberry and mango yogurts and it was cool that they had different flavored bobba. But asking for a tip off the bill I felt is an aggressive and unnecessary move."}
{"text":"Their shakes are pretty decent, I had the Banana Bread Pudding!
Their yogurt is a solid thumbs down though. It's just plain not good. If you're in the mood for froyo, do yourself a favor and find a PinkBerry or YogurtLand."}
{"text":"I stopped by here as I had some time to kill before the Mystere show next door started.  I started to pour in some yogurt from one of the machines and it was just liquid goop.  I approached the cashier and she told me that 2 of the dispensers were broken and that they would call someone to take a look.  I went to another dispenser and the same thing happened.  By now she was embarrassed, and started to mark multiple dispensers as broken.

I managed to get some chocolate cappuccino swirl and a mango-strawberry swirl.  I was surprised at how expensive the tiny portion was that I got, $6 and some change.  The strawberry and mango swirl tasted nothing like those flavors.  The consistency of the yogurt wasn't that great as well, it was really icy.

Overall I was really disappointed with the pricing and taste of the yogurt.   This was the worst frozen yogurt that I had tried."}
