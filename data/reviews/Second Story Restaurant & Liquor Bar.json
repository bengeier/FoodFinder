{"text":"This place is pretty neat, it has a sorta \"speak easy\" kinda vibe to it. Great place for a drink or two but one should avoid the lobster roll, it gives lobster rolls a bad name. I understand they're hard to do well, especially here in the Valley but just don't do it ?! And don't order a simple mans drink, they'll toss ya off the balcony (It's that kinda place) but definitely give it a shot !"}
{"text":"05/01/2017, 7pm, table for 6  Based on the the amazing reviews on Yelp about Second Story's food, drinks and ambiance, we decided to have our last dinner here this past Monday. We came to Scottsdale for a bachelorette, so the speakeasy style venue and ambiance was great. However, our dining experience was far from perfect..  Food - we ordered the brussels sprouts and mussels, those were both delicious! For our mains, we ordered the NY Strip Loin, the Market Fish (Lingcod), and the Bolognes. I'm no food snob but none of these were good, all were underwhelming at best - under seasoned and flavorless. Steak - for almost $50USD, I could have grilled a better tasting steak myself on the barbecue, there was absolutely ZERO flavor...we had to ask the server for salt and pepper! The Lingcod dish was poorly executed - the fish was dry and overcooked, lacked flavor, and the \"risotto\" (or so they called it) was literally bland, watery rice. The fish was also served with \"gnocchi\" but this was more of a flattened potato than a gnocchi. When we asked for salt and pepper the server did not ask about the food or how it tasted.  Drinks - we ordered a bottle of Prosecco and a Cabernet Sauvignon, they were fine.  Service - our server (a blonde lady with an athletic build) for the evening was not particularly friendly. She checked on us once or twice but it wasn't until halfway through our meal that she asked how the food was. One of the girls expressed that the food was just \"okay\" and needed salt, perhaps that displeased her as she never came back to our table after that (except to hand us our $400USD bill).  This is the first time I have felt the need to write a Yelp review as I have never left a restaurant feeling so disappointed on all levels. This meal cost us almost $600CAD but the food and service did not reflect that, not even close. Kind of a sour end to our amazing weekend in Scottsdale, we will definitely be back, just not to Second Story."}
{"text":"Went last night.  Great atmosphere and had super server Lori.  She knew all the details and history of the drinks and different liquors and their flavors.  They have pages on rums,whiskeys and scotches.  She was one of the smartest servers in az.    Prices are reasonable and it is a great place to have a conversation.  The food menu looked good so next time will be for dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing !!! From the posh decor to food and drinks. Drinks- Divine Intervention and let me tell you the name says it all completely amazing and you only need one! For dinner we had the Mushroom flatbread which was delicious, also try the chicken katsu sandwich you will loooove it, its got a little bit of asian fusion to it. The table next to us ordered the scallops and they looked and smelled incredibly so will definitely be going back! And may I add sitting outside on \"the second story\" incredible !"}
{"text":"A great, relaxed atmosphere for just sitting and talking. The drinks are delicious- I had an Old Fashion, really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Meh. The ambiance is great, very pretty and intimate with a good soundtrack. Menu looks good for appetizers, but weak on entree options. There were pasta and burger options, but I wanted a protein focused dinner. My only option was the steak. I should have known better since the price wasn't listed. All other dishes were $20-30.  My steak came out cold and had no side dish (one mini carrot and two burned Brussels sprouts don't count!). It was a large size steak, but came out pre-sliced, which I find odd for a quality piece of meat. I was shocked when the bill came and the steak was $50! This doesn't even compare to other $50 steaks in Scottsdale, of which there are many options. Another person in our party ordered the burger, which was huge and I tried a friend's pork belly lettuce wraps, which were tasty. But another friend complained the \"pasta for two\" was only enough for one. My advice: go here for a cocktail and appetizer and go somewhere else for a solid meal."}
{"text":"Where to begin?  With the cocktails which must have been witch-crafted to have such fine balance, flavor and originality?  Or should I describe the posh decor and polished dark woods bathed in the glow of a gorgeous central chandelier?  I could even discuss the wait staff's elegant attire, from lace dress clad ladies to bartenders channeling the long lost charisma of decades past.  But all of that charm and talent pales in comparison  to the food at Second Story Liquor Bar. I....am struck between an intense desire to keep this place a secret and hoard it for myself and the responsibility of a foodie to attempt to convey how scrumptious it was. First off, know that I don't have the words. You will have to try it for yourself.   And when you do, please give yourself the gift of the scallops entree.....you deserve it. Order the Scallops Carbonar -- gnocchi duo / uni butter / caviar / English peas / chantarelle mushrooms / shaved fennel / everything right in this world -- and never look back. If you're quick to drop the \"I don't like scallops\" card I played, just don't. Because you do. You like these scallops.  To.Die.For.  But don't die yet, because there are a million other amazing things on the menu. We started with the Inside Out Caprese - um, yum!  Also had the Duck Breast Roulade.....be still my heart. Bacon wrapped, golden raisins, sweet onions, parsnip puree, brussels sprouts, orange gastrique. I didn't even know what orange gastrique was before eating at SSLB, now it's all I can think about.   The flavors, the textures, the beauty of the dishes, it is mind boggling to me how inexpensive this restaurant is compared to the value of the food. They use top-notch ingredients, the dishes were designed and are plated by people for whom food is an art. Everything they should have thought of to make this place special and original, they did. I will literally live here all summer, that much is guaranteed. Do yourself a favor and have your next date night or ladies night or night out by yourself celebrating your awesomeness at Second Story Liquor Bar. I'll be there."}
{"text":"Restaurant week $44 menu with three dishes from three tracks (land sea air) plus dessert $8 more.  These new dishes are all fit for foodies to try, but not the great deal and variety as last year."}
{"text":"The food here is crazy good.  We had the 3 course menu.  The layers of flavors that are built by this very talented Chef is astounding. This is really fun place too. Everyone is in a good mood. The owner is concerned that everyone is happy. The pork belly is outstanding as well as the sea bass. You just cannot go wrong here."}
{"text":"I am always excited to dine in here! My friend and I had stumbled across this place in old town one night looking for dinner. We arrived at 11:30 pm and were unaware that they closed at 12. Still, we were seated and greeted with great service. They were nice enough to let us stay until 2 am. During the time, we got to meet almost everyone. The owner came out and talked to us personally. Tracey was kind enough to greet and welcome us as well. Since then, this has been our date night stop when we are in the mood for good food, drinks, and great service.   The next time that we decided to go was just as amazing. EVERYONE remembered us and welcomed us back. Susie was our waiter once again which was fantastic. She remembered what we liked to drink. It is hard to find a place with such personal service. We sat inside this time and it was amazing. The atmosphere was very intimate, classy, and romantic. Our waiter talked us into doing a three course meal. We started with the Pork sliders, then the Duck Roulade, and finally Peach Cream Rum Cake. Our waiter and the owner both recommended our choices and we were glad that they did.   I've been back several times since and I'm glad to be welcomed back every time. I definitely recommend this place if you're in the mood for gourmet food and drinks at great prices.   We will definitely be returning soon!!! :)"}
{"text":"Went in for drinks. The ladies working behind the bar were friendly and made awesome drinks!!  Had apps at the bar. The food took awhile to get but it was good. Will definitely stop by next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Valerie was our sever and she was amazing!! So nice and attentive! The drinks were awesome and so was the food! Def a place to go to!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and drinks. I love this place. The staff is amazing. The drinks were amazing. The food was amazing. Then I realized the guy working the door was the owner. So much love went into every aspect of this place. I have nothing but respect."}
{"text":"Great place to get an authentic mixed drink.  Tracy was great, she made sure that the staff took great care of us.  We challenged the mixologist TJ to make us each an original drink with our favorite liquor.  He crushed it.  Each drink was perfect.  I highly recommend this experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic! We ordered the Hanger Steak, Butternut Squash Ravioli & the Short Ribs and it was  EXCELLENT!  Not your typical restaurant. The decor is intimate but not stuffy.  The music is cool and the vibe was fun!  I also noticed they have a huge whiskey selection.  It's definitely the new hot spot."}
{"text":"I went to the second story liquor bar on Friday night (5/8) around nine thirty with my girlfriend and my best friend. The dining room was still full, however the greeter informed us that there was three open seats at the bar. The restaurant at first glance is very intimate, great music and a lively atmosphere. We all sat down at the bar and was greeted by JT who guided us through the cocktail menu. As a bartender and server at another local fine dining restaurant in Scottsdale the bar is sophisticated and warm. Their bar is predominately a whiskey, bourbon and scotch bar (not a bad thing at all), however they have other spirits as well. I had the old fashion which was very good and was perfectly executed. My girlfriend had a glass of champagne and my best friend had a specialty cocktail called the commodore. This bar is not a run of the mill bar the bartenders are not bartenders they are mixologists. Alex and JT know their facts and are extremely knowledgable and love to educate anyone because of the passion they display for their craft. Along with their knowledge both Alex and JT were so friendly and we had such a great time chatting and conversing about different cocktails and liquids. The price point is perfect for the quality of service and quality of the cocktails. All three of us will absolutely be back again!"}
{"text":"I don't normally leave reviews, but this place impressed me.  We ordered halibut tacos and they were top five best tacos I've ever eaten.  Each flavor was amazing as was the flavor and texture of the squid ink tortilla.  We also ordered the bison burger, which was delicious, but it came with the best potato chips I've ever eaten.  The texture was indescribably delicious.  I raved to the waiter and the executive chef came out to thank us.  My wife and I sat on the second floor patio above Scottsdale Rd. and had a blast eating great food and people watching.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time last night. Lori was A wonderful server she suggested many drinks and appetizers. We enjoyed them all and then we had dinner it was terrific"}
{"text":"A fantastic place to grab a cocktail, dinner or all of the above. Went here with a good friend of mine to grab some appetizers and a few drinks. We ended up staying till close because we had such a great experience.  We tried quite a few things from the menu and really enjoyed all of them. My favorites were the smoked pork belly confit and sea bass.   The cocktails were well prepared and we tried some amazing bourbons. Great service! We will definitely be back.     Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on Saturday night for Restaurant week. Drinks were very good, and probably the only thing I would consider having in the future (if I returned). The service was awful, and Mgmt was even worse with the way it was handled. Everyone's food came out at different times, so we never had the chance to eat together. It became awkward when I was the last person to receive my food, and had everyone waiting on me. The food and service took about 3 hours to finish our meal, which is unacceptable. There are only about 40-50 total people in the restaurant, so it should never take 3 hours to get an entree. I would not return to this restaurant, and only would recommend it to the French or any others who enjoy a 3 hour dinner service. They need to change Mgmt and service in order to make this place a success. Bartenders are the only thing keeping it in business right now."}
{"text":"Great drinks! Bees knees, old fashioned, sazerac were fantastic.  Aliza our waitress was awesome.  One of our favorite places and we definitely will be back."}
{"text":"We came here for a bachelorette party last weekend and had a GREAT time! The service was amazing. I had called ahead about doing a personalized menu and the owners were extremely accommodating and gracious. When we arrived, the beautiful menus were placed on the table ready to go. Our waitress was amazing, super patient as we asked her to explain practically every single cocktail. And the owner came and checked in to make sure we were having a good time.  Not to mention the food was incredible. Flat iron steak was phenomenal, the garden vegetable board was deliciously gourmet. Every detail was well thought out. And the chef stopped by to explain some of the food as well. We didn't have a bad dish!"}
{"text":"I planned a dinner for my colleagues and I for our first night in Scottsdale, and the experience from start to finish was phenomenal. I worked with Tommy, and he was great to help suggest menu items and was very flexible with our group and reservation. The chefs cooked us special mini versions of the appetizers they had on the menu so that it was easier to share with the table and all of the food and drinks was delicious. I eat out a lot and work with restaurants a lot for my job, and I wish it was always this easy to work with them!"}
{"text":"I am a total foodie who loves to try new places. SSLB is amazing! Menu was concise, there was not one item that did not sound delicious. Menu changes every six weeks. Service was impeccable. Loved all of it. We will surely be back every six weeks, if not before!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Bartenders Whim and asked for bourbon to be the base liquor and....they made me a Manhattan.  How creative!? It was a decent Manhattan, but I can make one just as good at home with my eyes closed.  My wife was disappointed with her drink as well.   We have been to a ton of mixology/craft cocktails etc.... This was one of the worst in recent memory."}
{"text":"Well first off there's no denying this place is gorgeous. Went here for my first time last night for my birthday and they really went the extra mile to make it special. The food was so amazing, as well as the drink I had. For the life of me I can not remember my server's name, but she was lovely. They brought me not one, but two deserts.  Both of which were delicious. And to top it off when the server came out to pass out the checks she let me know the chef had generously decided to pay for my meal. Probably some of the nicest service and food that I've ever had. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails and dinner. Service was wonderful with a fun atmosphere. A very talented team!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing service, wonderfully unexpected cocktails, and delicious food.  We were very impressed with the thought and effort behind every detail, including the menu, the ambiance, the music, and even the servers' outfits.  Everything is done with class, but isn't overly fussy in anyway.  Think a fusion of eras from dark speakeasies of the 20's and to Hollywood golden age glamour of the 40's and 50's.  We loved our experience and absolutely will return.  Thank you to Destinee, Nicole, Tommy, and our Chef for making our night particularly special."}
{"text":"Don't let the name of this wonderful restaurant throw you off.  No, it's not a speakeasy but a seriously creative contemporary restaurant.  The bar scene is there too but I go for the exceptional food.  It is well worth it - a true value for \"the very best.\""}
{"text":"I went to Second Story a while back during restaurant week, and it definitely turned out to be the highlight of the week. Great ambiance- modern and classy at the same time, with a bit of an old school twist. The food and cocktails were fantastic. I got the beet salad to start, which was very tasty, and then a stuffed chicken dish, which was equally good. They saved the best for last though, with a foie gras dish that was literally the BEST thing I've ever eaten. Anywhere. Ever. It even beat the foie at Babbo, Mario Batali's restaurant in NYC. Perfectly seared, creamy, delicious, paired with apples and cinnamon donuts. It was like a meaty dessert. I will honestly remember that dish for the rest of my life. Their cocktails were strong, creative, and tasty. The only slight negative was that service was pretty slow. Everyone was very friendly though. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"WOW great food and so romantic best place to drink and sneak away an hide  Holly in San Diego  Synergy World"}
{"text":"The food was spectacular here. I usually don't go for high-end restaurants with moderate portions but the food was just amazing. Lori was our server and she was so sweet checking up on us to see if everyone was taken care of and had a drink. Overall, very good spot to catch up with people given the intimate atmosphere. The kitchen was on point. I had the chicken fried brisket and others had the pan seared duck. It was exceptional. Slay."}
{"text":"Don't understand all the positive reviews. Wife and I went for dinner. Of the 6 entrees on menu they didn't have 3. Substitutions appeared to all be cheaper ingredients. Picked the goat appy. But no goat so they subbed chorizo. I had fish tacos, except out of halibut so subbed in shrimp. Very average food with an above average price. Wife had chicken. It was very good except the biscuit was raw in middle. Not sure how that could happen, but had to ask 2 people to get our server to come back. A \"business partner\" eventually came by and said he could do nothing about this meal but offered his card so he could \" take care of us\" next time. Not sure what that meant but we declined. There are so many great restaurants in Scottsdale why would we ever go back. Do yourself a favor and try one of the 50 better places in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Have been meaning to try this place for a while and finally made it last night. For anyone familiar with Jamie Boudreau's Canon: Whiskey & Bitters Emporium in Seattle, this feels a lot like Canon's younger sibling.  Cocktail menu, if not extensive, is unique and well balanced with a very nice whiskey collection. The food was good from start to finish. Our table of four enjoyed sampling most of the dishes (and cocktails) family style. One suggestion -- would have loved to see a \"tell us what you like and we'll create a cocktail just for you\" option on the menu to leverage the skill being demonstrated behind the bar."}
{"text":"Amazing vibe, live music, exceptional service (we had Bethany as our gorgeous waitress) DELICIOUS food and beautiful presentation! Get the fois gras and the duck!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails, great service, cool location right in old town Scottsdale. I've been here a few times now. The food is hit or miss... sometimes great and sometimes so so. The decor and vibe is nice."}
{"text":"Can't say enough great things about this place! Second Story is the real deal: superb cocktails and equally impressive food. I've been here a few times and it's always been nothing short of wonderful. The last time I was there for dinner, I decided to get a small plate and ended up having the most incredible butternut squash soup. The atmosphere is really cool (maybe a little too dark) and it's also fun sitting at the tiny bar and chatting with the bartenders. The only downside is needing a reservation if you're planning to eat dinner on Friday or Saturday."}
{"text":"Great whiskey selection with knowledgeable servers! Started with a flight and moved on to a classic cocktail. The flight was well curated and the cocktail expertly crafted. Happy hour appetizers complimented the drinks. The hamachi, pork belly, salad and butternut soup were all spot on. For the entrees, ribeye and venison were our selections. Venison won hands down.  Excellent preparation, perfect attention to detail."}
{"text":"Great location!  Fantastic drinks!  Ordered a Manhattan and an Old Fashioned and both were delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent spot in Scottsdale. Go on the weeknights for a one of a kind intimate experience learning about the brown spirits. Their bartenders truly have passion for what they are serving or education you on. Alex and John are great."}
{"text":"A great place for dinner. I had the three course tasting and i couldn't be more happier. My first course was the toasted bread with shitake mushrooms, caramelized onions, truffle oil and cheese was phenomenal. A great way to start the subsequent two courses. My wife had the deconstructed king crab chowder. She couldn't be happier with big pieces of succulent crab with fried potato cakes among other wonderful pieces of goodness. For my second course, I had the smoke pork belly confit. I always  hear about this on the cooking show and had to give it a try. It didn't disappoint both of us (my wife was snacking on plate :) Absolutely wonderful with micro greens, gnocchi's, red wine demi glaze...oh sooooo good. My last course was the macadamian crusted sea bass. i was a little worried about this one because I never seem to get a good piece of fish no matter where I go....Well hold on to your hats, this place has the most tender and wonderful sea base. It literally melts in your mouth and the accompanying Asian risotto and baby bok choi took our breath away,  Daniella (our waitress) was phenomenal and took great care of us. We sat out on the balcony and soaked up the sites (first time visitor)  and sounds of Scottsdale My wife and I will definitely make it back to the SSLB. A wonderful place and we recommend to all to visit"}
{"text":"Complete FAIL! Dinner tonight to celebrate a special occasion and thought this place would be perfect. It's restaurant week so it was a fixed menu so we ordered the cocktail pairing. The first course was bad but the second course was worse. Especially since we were never served the second course cocktail pairing. We expressed our concern to both our server and the manager who by the made no effort to come over and apologize to our table. Needless to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic bartenders that serve amazing cocktails!! Enjoyed the education and conversation with them. Learned that gin is not the nastiness I conjured up in my head. Can't wait to return and try the food."}
{"text":"I happened upon this place by accident- it was walking distance from my hotel(Marriott downtown Scottsdale) and the other place I was referred to had a private event. What a great surprise! The meatballs were magnificent, the Spanish octopus was fantastic, the bartender (tyler)knew how to make a good drink, the waitress (Shannon) was super friendly, and the after dinner drink (golden state)is a house specialty and might be the best cocktail ever invented!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I have been to in Arizona! The staff is very professional and attentive. Each staff member had tremendous knowledge of the food and drink menus. The owners were extremely friendly and welcoming. The atmosphere was very elegant and desirable for a night on the town with my girlfriend. Definitely recommend to anyone who is a fan of whiskey. This place is a must for anyone who wants a cozy date night spot. It is very reasonably priced and extremely delicious."}
{"text":"Meal was awesome , John was our mixologist and couldn't have asked for a better experience!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious from start to end!!  We sat at the bar and Alex the bartender was so wonderful!  I am not going to discuss each item we ordered bc they all were seriously so good and technically prepared and I'm sure everything else was also just as delicious. Thank you for a fantastic experience"}
{"text":"terrific atmosphere, service, whiskey/bourbon/rye selection. John the bartender is extremely knowledgeable and passionate without the pompous and arrogant attitude of many so-called \"mixologists\" (anyone that calls themselves that are too cute by 1/2 for me, just make great drinks with quality ingredients and present them without the attitude please). It's dark in a good way with modern yet classic style, a great lanai that wraps around, and unique entrance. Most of all the staff and service stand out and the food is interesting and delectable. Some items are a bit too crafty for me but the selection provides many different options. Used to have a good happy hour but not last time I went (Oct 9). Plus I just found out John surfs! His travel pedigree allows for always interesting conversation but inquire about any bourbon topics and he will leave you educated and interested with enthusiasm and wisdom that's fun to gain."}
{"text":"For happy hour, go for the vintage cocktails and try the delicious roasted carrot fondue with pepperjack, serranos, fresh apple, and assorted bread and veggies.   Everyone from the welcoming staff downstairs who will help you select a nice table, a bar stool or seat on the balcony with one of the best views in Downtown Scottsdale, to the knowledgeable bartender, to the friendly server, to the attentive restaurant manger Andrew and, of course, to Jordan Session, executive chef, the service and attention to detail of the staff is impressive.   We enjoyed a round of a perfectly mixed Old Fashioned, citrus vodka and an IPA. Session even hopped over the railing of the balcony and offered to pick a couple of squash blossoms in which he stuffed ricotta fresca, deep frying it in a light tempura-like batter, serving it on sticks plucked into a snifter of peat moss, used to remind guests of the earthy mainstay of the establishment--whiskey.   Session told my favorite dinner companion Lisa and me about the rooftop garden he uses to supply fresh herbs and vegetables to his favorite dishes, and then prepared a icy blood orange desert set inside the cup-like half peel of blood oranges picked from the yard of his uncle in town."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Spotty (bartender) is amazing to watch and very friendly.  Very generous wine pour, as a bonus!"}
{"text":"I would have given this place a one star but the guests who were there really seemed to be enjoying themselves. I went in with my husband, we sat down on the patio and were never greeted. The waitress even walked by us three times and never acknowledged us. I'd like to try the place again but won't do so when it's busy"}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying that the food at Second Story is great. I went there with my friend and his fiance so we each got their 3 course tasting with wine and whiskey pairings. We decided to get one of each of their \"Opening Fare\" so that we can sample all of the appetizers and I must say that they were all tasted very good. I especially liked the Buttermilk Pasta and the Crab Fritters. For my main course I got the Cardamom Crusted Duck. I have not eaten duck before but this was very good. The highlight of night for me though was that I finally tried some Yamazki 18yr whiskey. This is hands down the best whiskey I ever had.   Let's talk more about the Yamazaki 18yr. I originally intended to get the Yamazaki 12yr but the waitress informed me that they were out of it but that they just got some Yamazki 18yr in. She said it will be a little more expensive and I said that's fine since I already knew the price from looking at the menu earlier. I get my whiskey and I happily enjoy drinking it. After we got the check, I noticed something very strange about it. They charged me $150 for the Yamazaki 18yr. I looked back at the menu to make sure I was not seeing things and it turns out I wasn't. The menu lists the whiskey for $56 which is a large difference in price. Okay, I figured someone made a mistake so I inform the waitress to get this corrected. She proceeded to explain to me that the price in the menu is a misprint and the bill was correct.   What? You mean somebody accidently typed $56 instead of $150 and no one noticed? I told her no, I am paying $56 just like the menu says with no compromise. People make mistakes but give me a break. The Yamazaki 12yr is listed at $18 where as the Hibiki 12yr is listed at $25. Likewise, the Hibiki 21yr is listed at $100 where as the Yamazaki 18yr is listed at $56. Following this logic, you might as well list everything for $1 and charge $500 each at the end of the night. Sorry, but this is a very bad practice and bad business. The waitress even had the nerve to giggle as she was telling me about the misprint. After 20+ minutes, $94 was removed from the bill. I guess they thought that after having whiskey that we wouldn't notice the price difference. This is a very shady practice and the reason I gave Second Story Liquor Bar in old town Scottsdale a low rating.  Overall, the food was great, the service was great, and I enjoyed my whiskey. Probably not a bad spot for a date. My advice to everyone is to enjoy the atsosphere and food, but pay close attention to the bill as they might decided something on the menu is priced incorrectly and that they should charge you more for it."}
{"text":"We went here during restaurant week. Upon entering we were very impressed by the atmosphere and the live jazz music playing. We went with the restaurant week set menu, which included two apps and an entree. We also got the drink pairings.   The appetizers we tried were the octopus, a ravioli, a meat pasta, and a salad. All of these were amazing!! The best of which were the salad and meat pasta. We would definitely get both of these again. For the entrees we had the steak and salmon. The salmon was cooked a perfect medium as was the steak. The only negative comment is that the steak had a little bit of an irony flavor, but that just might be the cut of steak it was.   The drink pairings were all incredible and a good match for the food. The portion sizes are on the smaller size, which was nice to try lots of different dishes.   We will definitely be back here again soon!"}
{"text":"Usually we really like second story....  This time it just wasn't as good.  We had the Valentine's special and everything was okay....  But nothing was exceptional.   The bartender is very particular about being clean so he had us wait to sit and called my husband a mofo (in a light hearted fashion but still kinda inappropriate)   Our server forgot a few things ( our servers in the past were exceptional)  And the overall ambiance just wasn't as \"speakeasy\"/ dark and romantic  as usual.  It was louder, brighter, and more chaotic Than normal.  It was enough though for us to decide not to return again given the bill with 6 drink was 300$   Just not worth it.     Below is my previous review ---------------------------------- This is our new favorite date night spot.   Reminds me of SFO bars.  The staff is great, and drinks are on point.  It is a bit pricey though.  We really enjoyed the chefs board, and the beer bread!  Yumm!  They've had the same menu for a while- I look forward to a spring update (I hope)"}
{"text":"Great building and fun staff, unfortunately the service and communication doesn't match the former. Came here witha large group for a special occasion, making a late reservation. We ended up getting served a single drink and barely any food before getting told the kitchen was \"closing\". Proceed to see multiple tables order and receive drinks after this moment, which was frustrating to say the least. Hope they can capitalize on the potential of this place in the future"}
{"text":"I only went for late night snacks so can't say for the full menu. -1 star for the single malt scotch selection. I think I have most of what they carry (sans the non-Scottish ones) at home. Late night food was top notch. My gf and I were thoroughly impressed with the chef. Keep up the good work! Curious to check out the rest of the food menu. Cozy ambience. Loved the live music. Have recommended this place to others."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot in Old Town! Will definitely be back and become a regular. So beautiful inside when you walk up those stairs. Sat outside on the patio and it overlooked Scottsdale Rd. Great hand crafted drinks that were paired with amazing food!! Had the best service hands down. From the moment that we walked up to the hostess stand Sydney (sp) was nice and showed us to a great table. Loren came out and was so nice and personable explained the delicious menu! Nicole came to greet us and was warm and inviting. Told us all the great things to eat and drink. Ask for Nicole, she's the best! Loved Tracy and her accent! We both have a love for champagne. Met Tommy and he was so nice. Don, his father, constructed a beautiful place! I'm completely smitten with this place. Definitely my go to place, from here on out! Definitely telling everyone about this fabulous place!!"}
{"text":"This is an intimate restaurant - perfect for a date because the seating makes private conversation possible, and the music level is just right.  They do both steak and seafood right. The appitizers are imaginative and great.  The name of this place emphasizes liquor, but I don't see that as the highlight.  This is a gourmet restaurant.  Any food aficionado would be impressed here.  There is something to be said for being upstairs as well...more atmosphere, and a feeling that you're in a place that not many people know about."}
{"text":"Went to Second story for anniversary dinner.  Indulged on the 6 course tasting menu, the King crab chowder, braised goat, and sea bass were amongst the highlights of the night.  Service was good, very attentive and pleasant.  Desert, an apple walnut coffee cake was the lowlight of the meal, my personal preference would have been something in the dark chocolate world.  We will most certainly be back to Second Story and I will be telling all my foodie friends about this yummy spot!  A super great place with an amazingly talented chef l!!"}
{"text":"We finally made it back again and same as last time...outstanding. Glad to know it wasn't just luck the first time."}
{"text":"Second Story is probably my favorite bar in the old town area. They have by far the best drink menu that is constantly being reinvented based on the season, and because of them the Kentucky mule has become my new cocktail staple. Besides the mule, the katsu sliders are delicious though hot sauce on the side would be fantastic. However, the service from my favorite server Nicole is what keeps me coming back. She rocks! She is so professional and personable and makes the experience better. Plus the interior has a great speakeasy feel with books and dark wood everywhere. This is a real gem in the area where you can have nice drinks without the pretentiousness you get in Scottsdale,  so check it out!"}
{"text":"Bad food,  no drinks, terrible service, no apologies... don't waste 2 hours of your life for this place. Walked out of the meal!"}
{"text":"Arrived about a half hour before our reservation and the hostess was able to get us seated. Loved the interior of the bar. It was dark with just the right amount of lighting.   The menu was expansive. The whiskey/bourbon selection was especially good. I decided to go with a classic, the old fashioned. I selected what spirit I wanted in it and it came out perfect. Some places put too many unnecessary items in this cocktail but not here. It was made perfectly and tasted amazing.  Wife got the Every Rose Has it's Thorn and the presentation was solid and she loved the taste.  This is a great place to go after dinner to grab a drink and relax."}
{"text":"Perfect date night spot! I really liked the ambience. The first time I came here there was a tasting menu that came with the option of cocktail, wine or whisky pairing. Unfortunately I don't think it's available anymore or it's just for special occasions. Either way I wish it was always available cause I love tasting Menus for foods and drinks.   I also came here for restaurant week this year and that's really why I am writing this review. So approximately a month after I dined here I received a credit card transaction which I know could not have possibly occurred on that date so I called and left a voicemail. I waited a week and when I realized they had no intentions to call me back, I called again and the person on the phone was very courteous and explained the situation. Turns out that there was a system glitch that delayed the tip amount from that night to post. So at this point I'm already annoyed that a charge went through at a later date but what I'm really pissed about is that they never even called me back to clarify the issue even though I left a voicemail !! RUDE"}
{"text":"We were here to just have a drink and snack.  We ended up ordering the gnocchi with roasted veggies and it was good.  The gnocchi was tender and flavored well.  I was happy it was not your typical gnocchi dish that is doused with sauce.  This was a flavorful and healthy dish!"}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight with my husband. What a great meal! Chef McKinley is a very innovative Chef that serves fun,  yet elevated food.  Located on Scottsdale Road in a two-story building, it has a funky speak-easy feel. Fabulous drinks which are whiskey based. Ordered many dishes,  but my faves were the Cauliflower Carbonara Tagliatelle and the  Pork Belly Lettuce Wraps. Oh, the WTF Biscuits with seasonal jam are a MUST Order!"}
{"text":"I had been in for just drinks last week, and loved the atmosphere.  The menu looked great, which prompted a return trip. We were not disappointed!  Drink menu very unusual, and our server was able to help with selection The Corpse Reviver was great.  I loved that they have a tasting menu for dinner!  I had a very good capreses, excellent lobster linguine and cheese, and the best sea bass I think I have ever had.  The server suggested the rum cake afterwards, and although we liked it- tasted more like a pound cake.  I would highly recommend Second Story Liquor Bar for both atmosphere and food!"}
{"text":"If you're in the area looking for mind blowing food, fantastic drinks and above and beyond service this is your spot. The food is stellar and I can't get enough of that whiskey selection. Plus, Spotty, the bartender when I was there had some incredible tricks up his sleeve you won't find in many bartenders. Seriously a hidden gem and a perfect spot for a date."}
{"text":"What bar doesn't make Margaritas and only has 5 Red Wines of which they are out of one? What bar charges extra for round ice but doesn't tell you ahead of time? No drink here less than $13. Lame"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of visiting for the first time recently.  Loved the decor and the vibe.  My bartender Clint made me a special tequila cocktail that was amazingly refreshing and tasty! I chose the mussels entree-extraordinary!  It was the best melange of flavors.  We had a nice mixture of choices at our table, all were beautifully presented.  Service was good, with a sincere effort to please.  The atmosphere was perfect for settling in for good conversation. I am usually a wine drinker, but of course, this is the place for cocktails!  We had some innovative and delicious drinks."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went here on a Sunday night for dinner. This place was nothing short of amazing! From the venue to the service to the food and drinks, I was absolutely impressed. It's small but definitely packs a punch! We had the scallops and the honey mustard chicken, both were delicious! The service was five star for sure from the moment you approached the hostess stand. My fiancé wanted a Bloody Mary but they didn't have any mix to make one. So what did they do? They made one from scratch with a juicer in the kitchen. They go above and beyond to please and will make anything you ask for! Overall it was an awesome experience with a great patio view of Scottsdale road, we will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Robert, the bartender makes the bar here more than just a bar, he makes it's an experience. He is fun to watch and teaches his mixology techniques along the way. He teaches mixology classes here on Sunday afternoons. I've never been, but I can only imagine how much fun it would be.   My boyfriend and I go here often on a Sunday night to grab a cocktail before the work week begins. They offer happy hour all day on Sunday's which is great! Robert always has a new drink for us to try and it never disappoints. He outdoes himself every time. I can't say enough good things about this place. I look forward to trying their food soon. I'm sure it will exceed my expectations."}
{"text":"This week we decided to have our weekly happy hour at Second Story Liquor Bar, which had received some pretty great reviews on Yelp. At first glance this place looked great!  I really liked the indoor and outdoor seating, candle lights, and chandelier. There were only two small groups of people when we arrive at 6pm. It was not busy at all when we visited on a Wednesday night. We sat outside together because the weather in AZ this time of year is amazing! Once we sat down we were told that the current menu we were looking at was not current and that menus were being printed as we speak. The menu we had looked at was also different then the menu we saw online. This is definitely a $$$ not a $$ restaurant. We were then semi told verbally by the waitress what was on the Happy Hour menu. She left the table to get us water and none of us had a clue what was actually being served on the menu. Once she returned she brought a written list of what was going to be on the new menu. Very few food items were on the Happy Hour menu and none of their specialty drinks were on Happy Hour or less than $11 according to our waitress. Again, we didn't have a menu to verify anything. We ended up ordering a few mushroom flat breads that were good and called it a night. Service was quite poor compared to many local restaurants in the area. This place definitely has a nice inviting atmosphere at night with all of the candle lights. I wouldn't recommend this place for happy hour but I would possibly come back for a date night after 7pm just for drinks when you get a real feel of the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time tonight, was blown away by the bartender Sam's excellent service and the cocktails that he made for me, I asked what to eat that was small as I wasn't too hungry and he suggested the \"WTF Biscuits\" yes that's what they are called on the menu, and holy moly, those were the best biscuits I have ever had in my life, if those little biscuits had dicks I would suck the dizzle out of them and let them biscuit all over me face..."}
{"text":"Such an awesome and yummy and fresh place! The drinks are killer. The staff is super friendly. And the view; inside or out, is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Beth was our server tonight! SHE IS AMAZING! On point!! From the moment we sat down she had gone over the drink menu. She was prompt and attentive! The whole ambiance was perfect, dim lit lights all the way to the music. We really enjoyed ourselves! We will defiantly return!!!"}
{"text":"I would have given this seven stars. This place is elegant, sensual, classy, with staff that is very highly trained and super friendly. Wow! They serve whiskey cocktails, and many gin  prohibition- era cocktails that are authentic.  The mixology was awesome. I had corpse reviver - creme de violette-Cointreau- lillet. Also enjoyed French 75, and their rendition of the mule, all I can say is that the cocktails are very well made. Closest example I can think of is a chic-elegant-sexy restaurant in New York City.  We are foodies - the kind that will close our eyes and slowly chew to get a high off flavor and textures. Servers were dressed in theme reminding me of the prohibition era. Sarah was our server the first night and Laurie the next night - consistency is key and they have nailed it.  ( You must check out the restrooms- very cool- can't tell you why cause it will be a spoiler)   Food: The vegetables were fresh and seemed like they'd just been plucked. This chef is a genius. The flavor, textures, visual appeal are outstanding and thoughtful. He combines ingredients to bring out rich notes in the food. The menu is adventurous but at the same time very approachable and most importantly - delicious.  Can't go wrong.  Must have the noble bread burrata- indulgent as was panzanella. Dandelion gnocchi was unlike any, very light, cardamom crusted duck was almost too pretty to eat.  The menu changes seasonally.  Depending on what time you arrive you may see a regular dinner menu or a late night menu both are fantastic and are different in that there is very little overlap in the dishes between the two menus. We got there on Thursday night after the dinner menu was closed so it was the late-night menu.  The manager (Mike) is the nicest guy. We loved the food and ambiance so much and were sorry to have missed the dinner- we said we wanted to come in again- he promised us a table the next night (jazz night). We mentioned we were fans of pisco sour and he made sure to specially get pisco just for us. I can't remember a time where the food, cocktails, staff and ambiance were all this good."}
{"text":"This restaurant as a whole was absolutely amazing. The atmosphere was perfect for a nice date night out on the town or with a group of good friends. Dark, warm and romantic. The service was as good as it gets. Very attentive and took the time to explain every dish. Now for the food.... wow! There were 4 of us and each person got the 3  course sample menu and we all got something different. Every single dish that came out was beautiful and cooked perfect. We were all very impressed. The only thing I would like to see would be a few nice beers on tap as they only offer mix drinks and wine. There are some very nice upscale craft beers that would have paired very well with the overall feel and atmosphere. Other than that, it was a perfect experience and we will be back."}
{"text":"Had an amazing steak here. The drinks were strong, the service was on point and I enjoyed the ambiance. It's a charming dimly lit quaint restaurant. The menu is fairly limited, however all the dishes our group ordered were fantastic.  Excellent choice for a small group dinner or date night."}
{"text":"This is a neat little restaurant with a great varied menu. I tried the 4 course tasting and it was excellent. I was with a big group and Nicole,our waitress, was superb. She was very pleasant and helpful. I highly recommend it. Get reservations"}
{"text":"We came late after 1:00 to have a night cap and maybe a snack or desert. The menu was limited, the place has a cool vibe when you walk in (dark wood/leather) and the deck is nice to people watch below. Unfortunately the menu was real slim and desert was not on the menu. We ordered French fries. Over Cooked and greasy. Update-manage contacted me after my review and apologized for the fries and agreed to look at adding desert to the menu that puts them at 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Had the cheese board more than enough for two.  Cosmos were great.  Will come back"}
{"text":"This place has a great menu and they rotate it every 6-8 weeks. The staff is friendly and attentive. The drink menu is interesting and the decor is fun. Great vibe for a relaxed night or dinner. I would recommend this place for anyone."}
{"text":"Best burger ever. Fries were perfect. Great drinks and the service was very nice. Wish there was a bigger dessert menu."}
{"text":"One of the best dinners I have ever had! We had the mushroom flat bread as an appetizer and I had the filet for me entree. Daniella was a fantastic server! She gave us great suggestions on the menu and was very knowledgable about the items. So glad I came here for girls night out! Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Great ambiance  and excellent food. We had the filet sliders, Asian salad and mushroom Flatbread. All were excellent."}
{"text":"Hostesses seemed confused about where they had available tables, literally spinning in circles... First day? Pretty good wine list.. Went to order and only a few were available.. The waitress seemed irritated that we weren't interested in the ones they had in stock. Got a vodka soda and passed on food. Better luck next time."}
{"text":"I had the occasion to stop here for a quick cocktail with my buddy Jim earlier this week.  Quick impression is of a cozy, classy almost out of the way spot that I will absolutely visit again.  Situated on the second floor over a pizza spot, you walk up the stairs into what gives the impression of a vintage, old-school bar you might find the Rat Pack hanging out in. Dark, yet warm tones, low light.    The bartender ( cocktail creator / genius ) Alli whipped up a tasty concoction called a Vespa artfully garnished with a nice lemon spiral on the rim. After chatting for a bit, we went out onto the patio / balcony to enjoy the nice late afternoon and watch the sights along Scottsdale Rd.    This feels like a great place to come and enjoy a drink, some dinner or appetizers ( I can't speak to the offerings since we didn't have anything to eat, but that will change next time ). Looks ideal for a variety of occasions from spending time with friends, an intimate date, or just some quiet contemplation on the balcony with your favorite drink.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went in for a casual cocktail, an old fashioned. It was great! If you love gasoline cum juice served by a girl in a French maid outfit! If you're a feminist I would definitely avoid it like a man cave. If you're an old fashion fan I would say go to the shell station with a cup and pour a glass because it tastes better and is cheaper! This why this bar is hidden and dark so you don't make mistakes! Great view of See's Candie!"}
{"text":"Few restaurants are good or bad enough for me to write a review.  Me and the lady went here to kick off restaurant week. The restaurant week menu looked fantastic, so I was pretty excited.  The first course, the lady got the beet forms. A regular menu item for them, and is a small salad of sorts. The presentation was very pretty. The beets were in little cubes, there was some sweet cream drops, some greenery flat on the plate, very pretty, very tasty. The course was served with a corpse reviver that was very tasty.  I got the sweetbreads. I really hope they put these on their regular menu, because I would slap my own mother if she got in the way of these. And I love my mother. The sweetbreads were nice and thick, a little crispy, and came with some greenery and some green puree that I'm not sure what was exactly, but the plate was clean when they came to take This came with a New England Mule. Essentially, a moscow mule but with rum. Flor de Cana gold rum. A good choice.  For the second course, the lady got the scallops. They were sizable and incredibly tender. No rubber texture and not sandy or gritty at all. They were as scallops should be. This came with a gin fizz. How can you mess up a gin fizz? They didn't let me know.  I got the Chicken Gelantine stuffed with some duck mixture, and sided by some thinly sliced cauliflower and a cauliflower puree. The chicken was tasty and seasoned well, but the star was so obviously that duck mixture that the chicken was stuffed with. It was so fantastic. This came with some drink called Blueberry Cobbler. Not a drink, just by the name, that I would normally order. I'm more of a Manhattan/Old Fashioned sort of person. But the drink was, somehow, not too sweet, and was pretty pleasant. I probably wouldn't order it, only because they also have some great strong cocktails.  Course #3: The lady got the veal chop served with a mint julep. The veal was cooked very nicely. Still pink and just warm center, and it was all sorts of baby beef goodness.  I got the foie gras (not sure why anyone would pass on that...) and it was very nicely prepared. The foie was a substantial size, and had a nice carmelization on top. I think this was their attempt to outdo the sweetbreads. It was very close. This came with one of my favorite cocktails, the Sazerac. They used Templeton Rye for it, which I was a little anxious about, but it turned out very well.   We sat outside, so I can not attest to the atmosphere very much. The service was good. Our first drinks came out a little after the first course, but that is okay. We took a look at their regular menu before we left, and we will definitely be back.  Especially if they put those sweetbreads on the menu. A little pricey, but not for the area."}
{"text":"Awesome whiskey flight class! John was very knowledgeable and made the class super interesting!"}
{"text":"If you know the definition of epitome, this is it. If you don't, look it up.   For my second visit I chose Second Story for my birthday!  Tommy is the epitome of an owner that gets it!! Service is the epitome of top notch! Food is the epitome of amazing!!  Tommy, you have this figured out and it is highly appreciated!! Happy birthday to me!!"}
{"text":"Visited this establishment for the first time last night, and at first glance it is a very cozy place however the service was terrible.  The waitress made several mistakes and instead of communicating effectively, she tried to cover it up.  The final mistake was when she presented one bill and once we gave our payment she switched it.  Our original bill was $61 when she came back for a signature the bill showed $93.  Scam.... Dishonest....Rude....Disrespectful.... Finally we spoke with the manager who was absolutely not interested in what our concerns were and was reeking of alcohol.  He was unprofessional did not acknowledge or remedy the situation he instead made it worse.  In the end he told us to get out of his restaurant.  Maybe it was the alcohol talking..or maybe it was because we were of a different color...or maybe he doesn't value his customers.  Overall I will never visit this establishment again.  Customers never deserve to be treated rudely when mistakes are made you apologize for the mistake and remedy the situation...  To the owners comment..that is absolutely untrue we never asked for a free meal, we were not aggressive (he only said that because we are African American).    Do not be fooled by reviews at the top go to some of the earlier reviews and you will know he has a lot of nasty things to say about his customers after they leave a review, as well as a lot of misrepresentation with the bills and prices.    Check your receipts carefully.    Don't take my word for it read the reviews for yourself."}
{"text":"Can't make a Harvey Walbanger! WHAAAA!!!! It's a chic drink mixology joint. Get the ingredients for crying out LOUD!    My DAD has Gallianio for crying out LOUD!  Vodka, GALLIANIO AND ORANGE JUICE.  But it was still a great joint. I'll give it seven out of five stars this time only cause we had a delicious dinner at Cafe Monarch and we are all in a great mood!!   The \"bees Knees\" is different and  peculiar for sure!  The Tom Collins was alright. I had a diet coke since I am the designated driver. I want to try the butter cake, but no one else does.:("}
{"text":"new kitchen and bar staff. One week turnover and the food is amateur at best. We ordered a variety of dishes including Carrot Fondu, Sashimi Pepper salad,, crawfish, Breads, Bison Burger, Chicken and desserts... (Trying to keep this concise). All of this and two rounds of drinks cost $500. If the food and drinks were actually good this would be well justified. However, the wait staff had no clue about drinks in general and specifically here (whatsoever ) and had little input on the new menu. The \"mixologist\" couldn't even make a correct old fashion...Waitress actually forgot our first round! The menu was a mashup of very ordinary and unsuccessful attempts at gourmet american fare. Proportions were varied and reminiscent of an episode of chopped where they give some enormous app portion and a tiny unrefined dinner portion. Desert was a salted fudge thing with overcooked \"sugar cookie\" and vanilla water filled gelatin spheres served on a spoon, on a marble round, with smeared  mousse...blah blah senseless. It became humorous and for that we ended up having a blast poking fun at the overall experience.  It all kind of smashed into this hilarious michelin wannabe glory hole surprise. Its pretty obvious this is a cooking school dropout/ dream up pointless concoctions on grammas couch over bong rips and cartoon network situation... sorry for the rant!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, drinks were great, server was sweet....What turned us off was the bartender himself....the host was nice and asked us if we wanted to sit inside or out. My party said inside at the bar and we went walked up the stairs it was a bit crowded so we asked if we could move to the patio instead prior to sitting down. The bartender snapped at her as if it was her fault. It was not, he was rude, she seemed scared of him.   I know hosts / servers / bartenders / kitchen staff...etc don't always get along...but the customers do not need to see that."}
{"text":"Right in the heart of OldTown, check in downstairs then take a dark staircase upstairs to an old, dark, opulent and charming lounge.  It reminded you of an upscale speakeasy (is prohibition still going on?) it does kind of carry you back to the 20's. Service was okay a little negligent about water refills but definitely knowledgeable about whiskeys and craft cocktails, I was dinning with a relative who is a whiskey connoisseur so she was able to talk shop with our server.  I forget what whiskey craft cocktail I had but it was good.  I had the ricotta gnocchi which MY fault I didn't read the menu closely and it has roasted acorn squash and I HATE squash. Other than that it was good, Wednesday's have dollar oysters all day I wasn't it the mood on that particular day but it's good to know I may be back."}
{"text":"Came in for restaurant and was blown away! The ambiance is so relaxing and romantic with old school charm. The food was just amazing...such talent in the kitchen. The owners came over at each course to see what we thought as well as providing us with their own recommendations. I cannot wait to come back and try their regular menu.   The menu for restaurant week was foodgasmic! I do know they had a special menu for the event which is why I didn't specifically review what I ate..duck, foie gras, gnudi...making me hungry just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance and great drinks. A little on the pricey side, but well worth it. Great spot for a casual night out."}
{"text":"This was a night I will never forget. I cannot believe how amazing the food is here, but the service is ridiculous. Zero water refills all night long. My wife's Pinot Noir wine was filled and the waitress walked away without asking for us to taste it. We only got to tell her that it was bad 15 minutes later when she showed back up to ask how everything was when we were completely done with our food. Then there's the biggest issue of all, there whiskey list. I ordered a super premium Japanese whiskey listed for $56 on the menu, only to be told 5 minutes later that the real price is $100 and asked if I wanted it at $100. Are you kidding me! I will never be hustled here again"}
{"text":"We ended up at on the balcony at this place and I liked everything about it. The style, the menu options, the works. We enjoyed some carrot fondue and some rose bubbly for some reason. Next time I want to try the inside, i didn't see too much of it this time - but the balcony was great and not cold due to the infra heaters. It was almost an ideal date kinda place, and the service was great too. I don't have anything bad to say about this place.   I would never done the trek to go here, but since it was a impulse decision and I do not regret it."}
{"text":"While I've not dined in every restaurant in the Valley, this is by far the best place I've eaten in!    My friend and I shared the birch bread which we both agreed was fantastic especially because of the green super butter (heck, if you're gonna eat butter, might as well be a little healthier than usual).  The elderberry and peach jam was a bit floral though very nice.   Next, I had the frisee salad which was likewise delicious, dressed with this tangy green apple vinaigrette.  You might think at this point that I like veggies, but you would be wrong (read on); only when they are doused in some tasty dressing and accompanied by some animal product, in this case, lardon and crispy egg, would I dare to enjoy a salad.   So, onto a meat entree (you knew that was coming):  the bison burger--and with its layers of cheddar, mesquite onion, garlic aioli, and granny smith apple was the BEST bison burger I've ever had.  With its lower fat content, it's not easy to make a supple bison burger, but this chef obviously knows what he's doing.   My cocktail, Every Rosé Has Its Thorn (yes, that's right, a play on the Poison song), was pretty good.  I will have try some of their other creative concoctions.  My friend is a bourbon connoisseur and was pleased with the varied selections.    The only misstep was the dessert.  The apple cobbler was too sweet--and I do like sweet desserts.  But, this does not overshadow how great the meal was.   Our server, Beth, was very sweet and personable.  Indeed, all the staff was pleasant.   This restaurant is on par with any great desirable restaurant in NYC, so we are very fortunate in Scottsdale to have this terrific place, with its Southwestern inspired cuisine and cool ambience."}
{"text":"Fun and unique. Food is good and the bartender was fun. Loved the ambience inside. Probably better for small groups although I saw them accommodate larger groups as well."}
{"text":"First, let me say that I have passed this place for two years believing it was a pizza place. It's not! It has super amazing food and hand crafted cocktails. There were three of us, and every meal was wonderful. It's small and quaint with not many tables. Make sure to make a reservation. You will be happy you did!!"}
{"text":"You wouldn't know it by just the name, but this place is more than just a full service liquor bar. It's a gourmet dining experience with an abundance of decadent flavors. The ambiance is so unique, upscaled and refined, yet relaxed. I felt like I was in a scene from The Great Gatsby, shelves adorned with mini wooden barrels, alcohol regalia, comfortable seating, and a beautiful chandelier. It reminded me of a smaller version of Beauty and Essex in NYC. Even when I was in the bathroom, I was captivated by the stories of Paul Harvey.   Service was spot on thanks to Bethany. There were three of us and we each considered doing a tasting menu, but she suggested that we order more plates so that we could get more variety and save some money. Mind you, everything is fairly priced and worth every penny. What a great recommendation because there was not a dish that we did not love!   Now onto the food!  Social Plates: 1. Beer Bread: Our plate was presented to us with 6-8 pieces of delicious chunks of warm, savory bites and the house made churned butter was revealed with the lift of a small glass dish releasing a swirl of smoke.   Opening Fare: 2. Seasonal soup: Jalapeño soup: It was just the perfect amount of froth and such an original taste with a spicy kick. We have never had anything like it and wished we had some more beer bread to dip in it.  3. Roasted little gem salad: The texture was on point, beautifully plated, and refreshing.  4. Corned pork belly: I loved the pork belly spaeztle combination.  5. Foie gras: Last year, one of us had a bad experience when trying foie for the first time. However, this plate changed his experience and now he has a greater appreciation for properly prepared foie. All the components were perfectly selected for this dish. It is not easy to properly prepare foie and I applaud the chef for executing such a fantastic dish.  5. Ahi tuna (Hamachi crudo-unavailable): We did not mind the tuna substitution. The delicately sliced pieces of tuna were fresh and worked so well with the radish and sauce.  6. Whole grain gnocchi: The perfectly al dente gnocchi worked harmoniously with the pieces of tender brisket.   Dinner Fare: 7. Pan seared duck: The rich bold flavors of the duck blew us away.   8. Coffee charred venison: It's understandable to be intimidated by the name of this dish as venison is deer and can taste gamey if not properly prepared. However, we were all impressed by how it was exquisitely prepared. It tasted more like filet mignon rather than venison. And the wild boar bacon, wow!  9. Salmon (Wild striped bass-unavailable): Again, we did not mind the salmon substitution. The salmon was so delicious including the skin. Combined with the spaghetti squash and ponzu broth, the flavors and textures were just spectacular!   Sweet side: 10. Banana foster bread pudding: Scrumptious and paired with burnt popcorn ice cream. Yum!  11. Chocolate beignets: Definitely way better than Café Du Monde beignets! There are 5 pieces that come with the order along with a generous dollop of freshly made cream.   12. Cappuccino: A perfect cap to the end of dinner keeping you from falling into a sleep coma from all the astounding dishes!  Nick the chef is absolutely incredible and talented! Super down to earth and friendly, he came out to chat and to share some stories. He mentioned that the menu changes every ~4-6 weeks. Thank you again for such a special and unique experience! Our bellies are growling with anticipation for the next time!"}
{"text":"My wife Ellen and I went for the first time yesterday to Second Story Restaurant & Liquor Bar and had a simply outstanding happy hour. Jodi was our attentive and friendly server, bringing Ellen their Bee's Knees cocktail and me a fine Manhattan. Later we ordered the creative and delicious fry bread sliders with chorizo, something we'd eagerly have again.   As we were winding down the happy hour, Jordan, the executive chef came to our table and asked if we'd like to try an experimental new dessert, The Elvis. He described it as a small pastry sandwich made with thin layers of banana bread, peanut butter, and jam covered with dark chocolate, accompanied by three banana fritters with cinnamon batter. Of course, we said, \"Yes!\" The Elvis arrived as a beautiful presentation on a small serving board, with fresh berries artistically cut in half.   Later, Jordan came by to ask what we thought of it, and we gave him four thumbs up! He topped off our happy hour with an especially happy finish. Shortly before we left, Tommy, the owner, stopped by to greet us and to ask for feedback. We basically said what's in this review!   The setting is cozy and comfortable, with tasteful lighting and pleasing decor. We give the place our highest recommendation, now being one of our favorite places in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"It's been a few weeks since I visited second story and I'm still not entirely sure how I felt about it...  Let's start with the food, the food was 5-star and up there with the best meals in Phoenix. My group had the tasting menu, featuring all of the appetizers, the duck and the flank steak. We couldn't agree on the best appetizer as they were all stellar and the main dishes were perfect. The food was fun, inventive and best of all very accessible to non-foodies and foodies alike.   The problem here is the drinks. This is advertised as a liquor bar and has a strong slant toward whisk(e)y.  I expected some high quality wonderful cocktails to go along with the excellent food and I was flatly disappointed. The drinks were inconsistent, ranging from overly syrupy to over diluted.   As part of the tasting menu we also had the whiskey pairings. Each whiskey was excellent and paired well. One, the lagavulin 16, earned a spot in my bar at home. The problem was the waitress could barely tell me what I was drinking let alone give any detail on it. I suppose sitting at the bar might produce a better result but seating there was quite limiting.   The straw that broke the camels back however was the ending. Suffice it to say there was a not-so-slight price discrepancy that led to the bill being about $100 more than expected. It seems this can be chalked up to the waitress being poorly trained or unsure of the products available. To second story's credit, they fixed the issue for us...but it left a sour taste the way they tried to laugh it off like it was no big deal.   Bottom line, go for the food. Have a sip of whiskey or four, double check the bill and go somewhere else if you'd like a cocktail."}
{"text":"Really cool place, their menu changes all the time and they have it like a different episode of a season and they change season every year. Very cool concept, this place is a place if you are trying to impress."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place....I REALLY did. It's beautiful & sexy on the inside.   But dinner service was infuriatingly slow! Our waitress was a very soft-talker & we kept having to ask her to speak up and/or repeat. Yes, she was nice.   Food was....not memorable. I had duck with root vegetables on a black plate. Intriguing. Duck indeed was great. The side (black rice) was not good. Bummer!   Overall prices are on the higher end - but its Scottsdale.   Bottom line: go for the drinks & ambience. Skip the eats."}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday.....nevernind which one. My boyfriend and I both had a beautiful hand crafted cocktail, neither of which, do I remember the name of, but they were both delicious. Mine was made with a housemade pineapple syrup! Do it! He had one served straight up and with champagne. I stole a sip when he went to bathroom. Delicious, but mine was better. The duck I had was cooked to perfection! The presentation was stunning. Every delectable and beautiful morsel on that plate had a delicious and esthetic purpose. The bf's hanger steak was just as beautiful. I will be back before the next birthday...."}
{"text":"my fourth time here and i am so happy to keep coming back, an extensive cellar in a great bordello set up the staff is o so friendly, and the female bartender is wonderfull, all tho all of them are great she really knows here stuff, and i always come back to her and ask for her i love the ambience and the feel, it is desighned much like and old school bordello one might find in Europe, such a great upscale place, small like in europe so make a reservation or stand at the bar, and have a drink, the drink menu is very extensive and they have things to satisfy even the most decerning palate. And that is saying something as I have an excelent palate and can be a bit of a snob, amd i give five stars all the way around."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this dining experience and initially the vibe and atmosphere was really nice but the longer we sat there the less impressed I was. The serving staff tried hard and was very nice but seemed to rush everything which was my issue. I think a restaurant like that should allow patrons to take their time, enjoy a first drink and not be asked every 5 min if \"everything is ok\". Upon selecting our food choice it seemed to come out in a matter of minutes which to me certainly can't be personalized. In terms of quality and tastiness the food was fine. We enjoyed it well enough but to reinforce my point they need to slooooowwww down. Just to put an objective number to my point from sit down at 8 pm on a Saturday to getting the check was 50 min !!!  I get they want to turn tables but that's way too quick for this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"Aliza was the best server, she recommended some amazing whiskey. Make sure you uber home so you can have a fantastic time. The food is amazing, the Rosemary bread is the best in town"}
{"text":"I've been here several times now for both cocktails and food. Have always received great, friendly service and the food is delicious! My favorites are the sidecar cocktail and the house-made biscuits."}
{"text":"Either I was here on an off-night or my expectations were way off.  When my friend and I arrived for Happy Hour, it seemed like we were the only people there.  It definitely has a cool vibe to it.  If you're looking for a place to enjoy a cocktail with a date, I think this is a good choice.  If you're looking for a fun bar with great food/drink specials, I would go elsewhere.  Prices are steep, especially for the food.  We tried the fried chicken, and the size was laughable for $20.  But then again, that's likely because we came in thinking \"liquor bar,\" not \"fancy restaurant.\"  I may return for a drink, and now that I understand better what it's all about, I might enjoy it more.  But hey, that's what Yelp is for.  Know before ya go!"}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about this place.  The owner was outside to show us how to get up to the bar, and made sure we were seated promptly. The inside of this place was such a cool vibe! Very speak-easy kind of feel with a big, beautiful chandelier in the middle of the room. Our waitress was on-point with her knowledge of the menu, and gave great recommendations that we all were thankful we took! On top of that, the pace of the meal was great. She came to check on us just right amount of times, and never when our mouths were full (you know that moment when your server asks how your food is, but your mouth is so stuffed with it all you can do is make weird hand gestures and nod your head?)  The food was superb. There was some kind of celery root mash with my meal that you would honestly believe was real mashed potatoes!  Finally, dessert was phenomenal. They didn't have a dessert menu yet, but our server told us that the chef was trying out a strawberry shortcake kind of thing if we wanted to try it. Boy are we glad we did!! Our recommendation for the chef was to put that dessert on the menu as fast as possible because it was insane!  Oh yes, and the owner came up toward the end of our meal, just to OUR table, to see how everything was for us and thank us for coming. I don't think I've ever felt so special at dinner!  If that's not a 5 star experience I don't know what is. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This place is five stars. They have mixologist behind the bars making some incredible drinks. Order anything on the menu....they will surpass all expectations."}
{"text":"Ok, so I have been coming here every once in a while for a couple of years now. I always had good food & cocktails, but on my recent visit, it was even better.  The service was great. The waitress was accommodating of my drink requests, & gave great food suggestions. Now I have to talk about the pork belly sliders. I am not sure if they are just a happy hour item or not, but they are amazing. My friend & I, but probably more me, were actually making sounds when we ate them. You know that thing you did when you were a kid, & the food was so good you made noises? Those pork belly sliders are amazing.  So come here for the pork belly sliders, & then have some great drinks. I will definitely be back for more. I heard there may be a new chef, so that may be the reason the food is now really great. I need to try more of the menu for sure. My only negative is that they are not open on Sundays, which is a day I love to go for food & drinks in the afternoon, but I'll live."}
{"text":"Came with a friend on a Monday night of all things. Got some pretty good seats at a bar, which started a really decent end for a night in Old Town.  Not really seeking anything crazy from the get-go, we opted to start with a Mint Julep and a Sazerac. Both were excellent renditions of the standard - coming at $13 a pop, it was a little expensive but excellent nevertheless. I'd totally show you, but the low light intimacy makes for shitty iPhone pics.  As you'd expect, the whiskey selection was solid - lots of options on the back page with plenty of tiered prices, plus a really good selection of flights. I liked their naming sense a lot - flights like \"Godzilla vs. Mothra\" showcasing some good Japanese whiskeys, for example. I really should have remembered the name, but the one we tried was a sample of Glens - which had a really nice range from that punch in the gut, a smooth finish, and some really damn good scotch. 3 glasses in that flight were about 34, and you have flights ranging from 20 to a fancy 200 one.  Really appreciate when your bartender has tried much more than what's on the menu - shows the thought that went into determining the menu. He really knew his stuff, and definitely helped us a lot finding the next whiskey that felt just right.  Wish I had the bankroll to become a regular here, but from the alcoholz' perspective the night was a success, plus the food menu looked pretty bomb as well. Looking forward to the next time I'm around the stairs."}
{"text":"Where is the 2nd Story Liquor Bar?! Ahh yes...up on the 2nd floor next to the Gelato Spot! Reserved for a table of 9 the hostess brought us upstairs to the 2nd floor where a huge chandelier hung above a table for 2. Booths and tables all around and a bar at the top. A server immediately asked if we have been here before and educated us of their drinks, as well as recommended a couple drinks. Good job. And then came back with waters.   This place has a few of the \"weird\" plates that the general crowd will not normally eat so I of course had to go for it!   Social Plates:  - Bone Marrow - this in hindsight is one of the peasant part of the cow...the throw away parts you throw as a treat for your dog - but is becoming the beginning attraction of the show. With a bit of decoration to liven the dish it becomes a beauty to devour. The bone marrow - which is high in fat- is eaten like a spread over some toasted buttered bread and garnished with some baby fennel dressed in red vinegarette, literally a couple micro cress, garlic-grape marmalade. The combination of everything jammed like jelly. $16.   Opening Fare: - Foie^2 - this is the cold strawberry-like pate and a little fatty sac atop the same rectangle buttered toasted bread, cranberries, barley smacks (which I didn't think go well with the dish) (there was no Brie and no winter squash and I received the white bread instead of the brioche).The dish was very odd as if they didn't have all the ingredients listed on the menu- but was at least presented and hidden well. $23  Dinner Fare: -Chicken Fried Brisket- a fried battered large square cube of the beef brisket was deep fried with a side of horseradish mashed potatoes, shallot gravy, baby white and yellow carrots and broccoli. I liked the presentation of this dish especially with the cubed fried brisket. $25  Sweet Side: -Banana Foster Bread Pudding - bread pudding with ice cream and coin pieces of banana $10  Cocktail:  - Corpse Reviver - a citrus like drink. $13  Too bad they were out of the bass and only had salmon. Overall the dinner was likable but a few ingredients were missing. Water was not there after the first glass was given. I give this a 3.5 stars but will bump it up due to half stars."}
{"text":"We loved this place! Great atmosphere and cool vibe. Love the somewhat hidden entrance and the narrow stairway that takes you upstairs to this magical little getaway. Everyone from the hostess to the bartenders were kind and attentive. We just stopped in for a quick drink at the bar on our way to a friends party. I can't wait to go back when the weather cools down so we can sit on the patio and do some Scottsdale rd people watching. We had drinks only, no food this trip but the menu looked great. Even on this hot summer night the place looked pretty full so if they take reservations I would certainly make them."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Went last night for dinner and nothing could have been better. Best Chilean Sea Bass I've had in years. Service was great, server let us take our time with the menu and drinks. I'm not a whiskey drinker but it appears to be a paradise for those who are. We will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad we found this place on Yelp! I knew we were going to be staying a night in Old Town and was looking for a place close to the hotel that had foie gras on the menu (I live in CA where it's illegal...wth?) and I found this place. My boyfriend has never tried it before and was looking forward to seeing what the fuss was about. When we got there it was almost empty, but that's probably because someone is literally trying to cook AZ this time of year and no one wants to go out when it's 150 degrees.   It's a pretty small space but it's decorated nicely and the waitresses all wear these black lace dresses and have on red lipstick. It seemed very Robert Palmeresque, which is fine by me. Our waitress was very informative and told us this was actually a , whiskey tasting bar...I could see my boyfriends face light up when she said that. She also informed us that they were going to be changing the menu and the chef's were doing some sort of chef's whim appetizer where you don't know what you're going to get. Sounds good to me! We ordered the foie gras....they were out!!! Oh no, this is what we came for! Oh well, we ordered the chef's whim and a flight of whiskey's to try. We also ordered a cocktail that was their take on a whiskey sour.   Our surprise app was swordfish, but it wasn't just swordfish, it was the best swordfish either of us have ever had! I don't know what all they did to it because it was their whim and it wasn't described on the menu...all I can say about that is trust the chef! If they do that whim thing again and you're there, get it! We loved the cocktail and our favorite whiskey was the Maker's Mark 46.   We were going to order another app when our waitress informed us that the chef found a 2 oz. serving of foie gras and said he would make us something with it if we would let him do the whim thingy...again, do the whim! Of course we did it.  Oh My God it was sooo good! Now my boyfriend knows why I've been whining about this stupid duck liver ban in CA. Ridiculous hippies! People should have foie gras everywhere! It seemed like it was panseared and placed on top of toasted brioche with some sort of fruit sauce. It was not only beautiful, but probably one of the best things I've eaten in a really long time.   Anyway, if you have the pleasure of trying this place, I would tell you to get whatever the chef's making that day because he really knows what he's doing. And the waitress was so friendly and gave us a great happy hour experience. We both agreed that this place was our favorite place we tried in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I'm in a different city each week for work. Hands down best meal ever; the Chilean Sea Bass. Not only was it a beautiful presentation but the flavors were suburb! Do not be turned off by parsnips on the plate, they were very mild and delicious. Service was excellent! Hard to find these days. Beth took great care of me!"}
{"text":"You'd think this place was a cocktail bar, but to my delight, the food was incredible.  We ordered the pork belly lettuce wrap, poke with crispy rice, and grilled octopus. The pork was perfectly seasoned.  The crispy rice added a crunchy contrast to the poke. The octopus came out on a bed of beans with veges, and was perfectly cooked and tender.   The real gem was our server, Kaylin.  She was extremely knowledgeable about both the drink and food menus.   She recommended the Velvette Reveler (a gin drink) for me and a Street Fighter (mescal-based and not even on the menu) for my husband.  Absolutely fantastic!  I would definitely recommend this place to friends, family, and anyone visiting Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I had the great pleasure to dine here on Sunday... Wow what great staff Friendly, knowledgeable on all menu items. We had the sea bass and scallops both awesome!!!!! The atmosphere dark and relaxed.They also have a nice patio great people watching. Good Luck with your new venture I think you will do great..."}
{"text":"Great, quaint. I would personally recommend only in groups of four or less. A bit salty (like most places IMO), but an excellent burger - and old fashion drink."}
{"text":"A lot of attention is taken into every dish and drink made. Highly recommended with a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I want to like this place but the food didn't quite do it for us. The drinks were amazing! very well made but had some ingredients that I had never heard of and when i asked our waitress she didn't know what was in the drink either. the atmosphere is dark and has that \"loungey\" feel which we really liked for a fun date night. it's kind of a smaller place so we could hear the conversations next to us but overall I'd give the setting and drinks a 5 star.   We started out with the biscuits which were incredible! they melt in your mouth and come with a spicy jam. I'd have those again any day. Unfortunately, the menu is really limited and we wanted to make sure to enjoy our meals so we ordered the two simplest things. A burger and spaghetti bolognese. First impression- the food came out fast, I was impressed because it was a busy night and expected the wait to be much longer. the presentation was great too. it looked delicious! Then i realized why the food came so fast.. the burger was almost completely raw and the spaghetti was hard- almost crunchy and completely undercooked. I had a bite of the burger and I couldn't even swallow it! My boyfriend sent it back and they brought out a brand new burger which was nice and it was much tastier so we were happy with that! I tried to eat the pasta but ended up setting it to the side. The taste was great the texture was not.   We ended up receiving $35 gift cards but nothing was taken off the check. We were okay with this. I think we will definitely be back to sit at the bar and order the biscuits and drinks but not sure about the entree's. Not to mention $35 doesn't get you very far at this place. Definitely worth a second chance!!"}
{"text":"This place is super cute! The atmosphere of this place is awesome! I didn't realize it was a restaurant until we were seated and handed menus. We were just here for the drinks. After finding Second Story on yelp, my sister knew she wanted a whiskey or bourbon! We decided on craft cocktails on the menu. I LOVE a good gin drink and they had some interesting options. I went with the Pendennis club and honestly, I was not a fan. I'm not sure if it was the bitters or what it was. I drink Gin often and this just didn't do it for me!!!! I would have much rather had a margarita. My sister got the Conquistador and liked the texture and enjoyed the aroma of the tea. The taste of tea was a bit muted but she really enjoyed the bourbon. This wasn't my favorite bar but I'd come back for the atmosphere but I might have the bartender make me something I know I like!"}
{"text":"What a unique place to have a beverage! So normally they dress in speakeasy outfits, but tonight is Halloween! So we will let you be surprised. As they take you upstairs check out the pink and blue lights for the restroom. Which one are you? The menu really satisfies if you are into history. You can have a beverage that originates from the 1800's. Tell Aliza we say hi when you go! She was awesome!"}
{"text":"Unique drinks.  Very upscale and the service is very good, however it's kinda pricey."}
{"text":"I came right after work and got a sweet outside patio seat on a perfect evening. Table service was friendly and didn't rush. Food and drink prices are spendy, so cash in that savings bond before you order. Parking is tight you'll likely have to use the garage across the street."}
{"text":"Sock you in the mouth strength Old Fashioned.  Some of the bites were pretty amazing but not all.  Service was Ok."}
{"text":"I learned about this place via a New Times email and it turned out to be a great little place.  Seated atop The Gelato Stop, it's speakeasy-lounge type of place with a great menu of Prohibition era drinks.  The food menu isn't huge but that's often a good sign.  My lobster roll (which was my virgin lobster roll) was nothing short of fantastic.  Wait staff was great and it's a fun little place to sit and drink on a Saturday."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to visit this bar for months. During our friend's bachelorette we stopped in, and were told to wait downstairs because they didn't have room for us. Then we were led upstairs and the place was empty which was super confusing. We sat outside as there were 6 of us, and our server brought us complimentary rosé which was sweet, but then we didn't see her, for 20-25 minutes at a time and the place was literally empty.   We ordered the bride a fun drink and it was literally the worst thing I've ever tasted, tried another and same thing so we finally gave up and tried to cash out but couldn't find our server again.   The whole thing was super disappointing."}
{"text":"Very good food. Service is prompt and helpful. Set aside 90 minutes to two hours for dinner. The inside portion of the restaurant can get noisy for conversation. I recommend the patio for people watching on the street below. Overall ambiance is great.  Menu is limited to 6-8 items plus a daily special fish. I have had the daily special several times and it has never disappointed me. I have also tried their other entrees and they have been very good. I think the short menu is a good thing but check it out first if you're an picky eater.   Whiskey selection is decent with 20-30 options available on the menu. Evidently I have missed the back bar where they have a much bigger selection beyond just what is on the menu ; ) Had an old fashioned to try their cocktails. It was a fine example of an old fashioned."}
{"text":"Just happened across this quaint little place while scrolling through yelp. So glad I did! Our vip experience started at the front door where the hostess radioed up to someone that she was sending up two ladies. I felt like I needed a secret password! We were greeted at the top of the stairs and taken to any table of our choice.  The atmosphere was casual,  but kinda romantic at the same time. Weird since I was with a friend and not my husband, so we opted for the balcony. Lol.  Our server was ultra friendly and took very good care of us. The balcony had a perfect view of scottsdale road,  so we we able to people watch while having a few drinks.  I would definitely return to this place and try the food next time! BTW, they have the best crushed ice of any bar I've been to! Til next time second story!"}
{"text":"Great cocktails.  Absolutely forgettable food.  I would go again, for a drink, but will eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is a really neat different kinda spot. I was pretty excited to check it out last week.   The vibe is nothing like anything you will find in Oldtown, and I hope it stays that way. Very small but the patio over looking Scottsdale is money! Great idea.  Our waitress had the cutest outfit on-the staff all wore lace dresses. She was very informative about the restaurant, food & drinks.  We had the lobster roll & their well known burger - I was sold on the mozzarella pattie that was on the burger! The lobster roll was disappointing, the bread was cold and hard :/  Burger was on point thou!  The drinks were very slow. And service to receive them became even more slow as the night went on :/ Yes, we started with some craftier drinks offered on their menu but a round  beers were taking about 12-15 mins to get to us. And not to mention, beers were not cold :/   We lost the waitress we started with and the English /british manager did chat with us and was very charming- but only thinking she was like that to cover the fact the bartenders were not up to speed or they are too busy to handle the crowds needs? My group was not impressed waiting a long time for beers.  So, funny story. I was in line for the bathroom and a girl came out , wide eyed- and said \"beware of the bathroom, it's very republican!\" So I entered very alarmed and confused and heard Paul Harvey speaking instead of regular typical music ! It made me laugh! Typical Scottsdale bar goers are not going to understand such a different thing haha! But I thought it was amusing..and it a little creepy! Lol!  Over all it's beautiful and so different ! I want to give 3.5 stars- but if I go next time - my group is going to have to be extra patient waiting on drinks..which doesn't make a Friday night fun. Hope- they improve this asap!"}
{"text":"What a gem! From the amazingly classy yet comfortable ambience to the unique rustic style food it is truly unforgettable. Must try carrot fondue and birth bread. I will defiantly be heading back very soon :)"}
{"text":"Killer cocktails and the chicken pasta was to die for!  Recommend all the cocktails and request booth/table by window"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, creative cocktail menu, skilled mixologists, solid scotch list and easy entry.   Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Great service, incredibly cooked duck meal, perfect portion, tasty drinks/martinis and a cheese board I won't forget"}
{"text":"I've been here several times both with my husband and with a girlfriend. I love this place. Their HH menu is great and their nightly specials are fun - especially $1 oysters on Wednesdays. The staff is friendly and the old fashions are delicious.   We go early so it's not too crowded. This is definitely one of our favorite spots in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Second Story Restaurant and Liquor Bar is a great discovery for my wife and I for dining and in several visits over the last couple months find it getting better and better.  Upon one of our recent visits, and to our pleasant surprise, we ran into new operating partner Michael Bunker, who we got to know from his days at The Mission.  Michael's youthful looks and his exuberance in this new endeavor belie his food and beverage experience so we look forward to how he shapes Second Story.   Michael tells us the Second Story menu, which is influenced by Executive Chef Jason McGrath is evolving and will change regularly.  We really like this approach as it'll bring us back for more.  Some items featured during the recent Arizona Restaurant Week have made it to the regular menu.  Also, the emphasis on whiskey will evolve to a more well-rounded liquor menu.   A recent Saturday dining experience included the Blistered Shishito Peppers and Red Asparagus as our starters and we shared the Bison Burger and Flat Iron Steak.  5-stars all around.  I tried a new vodka cocktail that hit the spot.  Since my wife doesn't drink alcohol one of the servers named Bethany offered to have the bar create a fancy \"mocktale\", which she enjoyed.  If you're lucky enough to get Bethany or Lori as your servers, they will surely add to a great experience."}
{"text":"Looking for bartenders who know how to mix drinks? This is your place! We are from out of town but we hit up the best places for cocktails when we travel and this place is top notch!   We have not tried any food here but if the food is the same quality as the drinks then you're in for a treat!"}
{"text":"Very quaint...maybe 40 seats strategically arranged so that you wouldn't bump shoulders too much with your neighbor. The atmosphere is laidback, semi-dimly lit, quiet. Nice place to meet on a first date or after work with friends. Parking garage is adjacent, so no circling the blocking and hoping! Staff was very welcoming in passing.  I sat at the 5-stool bar. Very Sarcastic \"keeper of the bar\"! Alex is his name. Doesn't have the typical bartender personality...can come across as very rude.  I didn't order any food, but the drink was nice and stiff. I will return to get the full experience; I wouldn't think of sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and an absolute must stop for drinks and food. Specifically come for the drinks. They have a bourbon selection that not only rivals but in a few ways surpasses that of which you can find in a good Kentucky bourbon bar. Sit at the bar and talk with the creator and enjoy watching them make fantastic drinks with great conversation about bourbon and scotch. Seriously loved this place."}
{"text":"The owner called me immediately after I reviewed Second Story the other day. He was professional and we had a great conversation. As a small business owner I am impressed when someone goes the extra mile and reaches out to try and correct a situation. My partner and I will be revisiting Second Story Restaurant and I believe our next experience will be far better. Thank you Tommy for giving me a call and sending me a text message. Kudos to you for being a professional."}
{"text":"Could be charming but it's not there yet. Service was lacking. She couldn't remember the fish of the day and got his beer wrong not once but twice. When he finally brought it up to the manager, her response was, \"oh she probably just forgot to tell you we're out of the beer on the menu so this is close to it.\" I'm sorry...a french white spiced beer is not close to an apricot hefeweizen. We ended up staying only for appetizers. Oysters were good. Cauliflower was overly acidic. Hopefully they figure things out soon"}
{"text":"Second Story works at cultivating an exclusive speak easy vibe. A hostess on the sidewalk calls upstairs to a second hostess, who greets and seats guests. The interior is sleek black wood, mirrors, leather banquettes, crystal chandeliers. Guests chat over expensive cocktails and loud jazz. It almost works--the leather is worn and too much kitsch kills the sleek lines, but it's dark and everyone is pleasantly tipsy anyhow.  We started with the falafel, whipped feta, baba ganoush and pickled onions. I was a bit put off by the $13 price tag for three balls of falafel. That said, the falafel was perfect--moist with a hint of honey on the outside. The baba ganoush was excellent. My partner complained there wasn't enough of it--we had extra pita long after we ran out of feta and eggplant. I felt like it was a pretty perfect plate.  We split the ricotta gnocchi for our main course. My expectations had been set and I was disappointed. The gnocchi was on the dry side and completely under seasoned. There was a good variety of roasted squash and some of it was quite tasty, but I got hints of flavor that suggested the oil had hit its smoking point during the roasting process. It was an interesting dish, but not a particularly delicious one and probably not one I would order again. Not to be cliched, but a bit of browned butter would have gone a long way here.  The service was good and unobtrusive. My one complaint was that we weren't offered dessert. Perhaps the one glass of wine and shared appetizer and entree did not justify the valuable real estate we were occupying to the server. I just assumed there was no dessert menu, but when the server at the table next to us offered up something involving lavender and walnuts, I got a bit jealous. Dessert would have been nice, though there is gelato just downstairs."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful... was a little leary at first especially since I wasn't sure what to expect... Speakeasy atmosphere was fun, waitress was great, knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"We (me and my wife) went here, lured by the \"Liquor Bar\" in the title. We wanted a quiet bar to get a couple of drinks. Food wasn't what we were looking for.  The staff told us that the place had only been open a week as we went in. A lot of time was spent telling us how great the drinks and food is, but it took a while to actually get the drinks.  It was ok - If you are looking for food I suspect it will be very good - the food sounded great but we were not hungry.   The location is excellent, outside on the veranda looking over the street.   The staff were very friendly and well presented (I had to remember to look at the face).  So my advice to the staff is -- Relax, get a drink in the hands of your customers quickly, and find out if people want food before pushing it. With a name like a 'Liquor Bar' you probably get many customers just looking for drinks. You have an excellent location and good drinks and probably good food. Also turn the music down. A quiet bar encourages conversation which makes for a great bar.  I'll probably be back next time I visit but I'll be sure to let them know I don't want food early if I don't want food."}
{"text":"I had the chicken and it was amazing, I plan on coming back. The restaurant is very sophisticated but you can dress casually! Service was very friendly!"}
{"text":"3 words: Classy. As. Hell  This place has it all: swanky decor, unbelievable variety on the menu (try the tasting menu for full experience), amazing well crafted cocktails (the only place I've found in the area that takes any pride in cocktail menu/spirit selection/cocktail culture) and knowledgable staff who can answer any question and provide advice for any palate.  This place rocks. Don't skimp, spend a few bucks, enjoy yourself, ask questions, and bask in the greatness that is The Second Story Liquor Bar."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect. The service, the ambiance, the wine and the food. Dishes with amazing flavor and presentation. Will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"Yea I went with 5 whole stars, why you ask? That's simple because they earned them.   For being as small as the space is they really aren't in your face making you feel uncomfortable/awkward which is hard to accomplish and also highly desired when your looking for a new place to go. \"Just enough\" was the key to making the night wonderful, delightful and memorable. The bartender (who's name is escaping me ATM dammit!!) was great. And that coming from a someone who has been in the industry is saying a lot.  The food was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G a sim not just saying that. When your considering picking up the plate and licking it you know that shit was the bomb.com. I had the old fashion which was executed quite well with angostura bitters pushing it that much closer to my heart. I also had the tacos Jalisco mule , minus the tacos. It was delicious and I even got my step mom to try and she was impressed.    The whole experience was one that dreams are made of and I really hope they stay busy and stick around. Furthermore I hope they become a staple in the old town district.  Yum"}
{"text":"Perfect! Great place to grab a cocktail before dinner. Didn't enjoy any food but enjoyed all the drinks. Would recommend to anyone! :)"}
{"text":"Long day of work in San Francisco, racing to catch a plane (that's naturally delayed) and getting into Scottsdale after 9pm -- what do we possibly do for dinner?  When we spotted Second Story, the choice seemed fairly obvious and we were rewarded for it.  It's ostensibly a liquor bar/cocktail bar as evidenced by the name, but don't be fooled -- they make really good food here as well. To get in, talk to the host outside to the left of the pizzeria and they'll get you set up and then head up the stairs. Once you get there, you'll see tons of dark woods and lush, deep browns highlighting what is a great upscale addition to the scene. You wouldn't think this was out of place in LA or New York.  Drinks as you might imagine are delicious and the food is really good. Highly recommend the Diablo Del Sol, which our waitress listed as her favorite and, as for food, you can't go wrong with 'Don Just Wants Some F*cking Bolognese'* which is only on the happy hour menu.  And the happy hour menu is where it's at. Sure, you could get there early and do the typical happy hour but what you really want is to get there after 9 and do the happy hour menu then. You don't need a full meal here -- the HH portions are fairly meaty. And combined with a few cocktails**, you can get out for a fairly decent price. The two of us, with drinks, were under $100 for dinner tip and tax included.  The only thing I didn't really love about it, and hence the four stars, was the theme -- having them 'take us on a journey' or explaining 'the story of the menu' that we would 'be experiencing' were a bit much on the pretension side. But the food greatly outweighs anything else you could dock them for. And considering they've only been open a month, they'll probably smooth that out down the road.  Try to sit outside. It's really nice!  * - the story we heard: the owners' father, named Don, owns the pizzeria downstairs and whenever they would take him out to dinner, he always ordered pasta and bolognese. So what you'll get here is delicious, homemade pasta and some seriously large meatballs. You can't go wrong.  ** - designate a DD, kids."}
{"text":"The ambience here is so different but enchanting! We tried the rabbit tamales which were excellent, and the service was really good. Excited to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"The service here is beyond impeccable. It is an art form. They are themed like a 20s movie, the uniforms are black lace dresses with tiny black and white frilled aprons and adorable. The upper level balcony is tight but cozy and overlooks Scottsdale Rd and 3rd. The menu is laid out like a script with plot twists and main story lines...I ordered the four course tasting (up to seven are available) and made it chefs choice. My server, Loren, was beautiful beyond stunning and elegant as well. And so too were all the staff and my nearby dinner guests as well! They have a reverse happy hour which means this could be a good late night stop.My first drink was the corpse reviver (appropriate as I was reading the hunger games as I was dining alone and lots of corpses in that book that needed reviving... and got it...), and it was refreshing like a lemonade. The GM even came out to say hello and share some excitement. And all the while, the music was great!My first course was the inside out caprese which was amazing and complex and quite large for a tasting item! And the olive oil dust on it was unique and fun! It was followed by a perfectly sized sea bass over a bed of farrow, something I would never have picked, but man it was GREAT! I told Loren that I was avoiding sugar, so I wasn't interested in drinks with sweet and sour or simple sugars... she laughed and talked about how amazing their ingredients were and brought me my second drink... and it was delicious.  My third drink was a blueberry cobbler if I remember correctly. I could pick my second drink off the menu, but can't recall the name now and apparently some of my notes didn't survive the night. :)After the sea bass I was served veal, and quite a large amount of it too. One piece on a bone, the other two not. I am not a veal fan, but I ate it and as far as Veal goes, it was right on.  My final course was the Prime steak and it was absolutely perfect. I avoid prime rib and rib eyes as I don't like fatty meats, but this one was trimmed perfectly, just full of amazing flavor and no fat at all visible. And the mango gelle was great!Not only did the GM pay me a visit, but other waitresses came out to say hi, and then the owner! And then the chef! It is a rare treat to get to talk to a beautiful waitress, her wonderful colleagues, her GM, the owner and the chef all on your very first visit! Without a doubt, service is their number one mission and so is elegant unusual food!This has moved into my number one spot for a pre bar hop dinner in oldtown and I will be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"I love the decor and space of this spot! 2nd visit last night and it was perfect. We mainly had cocktails but we also tried the wings. The wings were okay nothing spectacular.   I loved my cocktail it was something with whiskey, haha. This is a must goto spot when in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My hubby took me here for my bday dinner and it was delicious. The ambience was great and I loved the decor. It had a speak easy feel type to it. We ordered a 3 course tasting menu and every part of it was delicious! Started off with king crab salad and garbure then short rib, foie gras, and finished off with sea bass and kobe beef. Although it was a tasting menu, I was full off of the 2nd course. Everything was decadent and delicious. The waitress was also attentive and the drinks were yummy as well. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I booked Second Story for our rehearsal dinner.  We booked the entire restaurant from 4-7pm for 40+ guests on a Friday night.  The owner, Tommy, is an amazing host and restauranteur.  He and his team worked with us on a custom menu within our budget.  The food and flow of the evening was perfect.  Thanks Tommy for all your hard work."}
{"text":"Love this place, the food is to die for. I came here with my family and we sat inside. They have a live band playing which I personally love. The chef is really young but he has got a really amazing skill set for what he does in the kitchen. The place is very small so make sure to make a reservation. Since it's very small, they hold a charge on your credit card if  you cancel so make sure not to!  I also have come here just to grab the meat board and a martini and sit on the outside balcony which overlooks scottsdale road. If you haven't gone then you must go!"}
{"text":"I came here last night for the second time and was very impressed. The first time I came it was very shortly after they opened and it was pretty much completely empty. But Friday night here is now is bustling which pleased me as I hope this establishment does well.   The decor is lovely, and would be perfect for a date night, girls night, or any other intimate evening. The crowd is sophisticated and slightly older and dressed up (Read: you won't find students here being rowdy, drunk, loud and disorderly) The bathrooms and clean and fresh and the staff are very attentive while not being overbearing.  I always order an Old Fashioned to judge the bartenders skills, I was quite impressed and I'd say that this is the best place for an old fashioned in the Phoenix area. The other drinks are equally impressive although can swing on the sweeter side.  The menu is very unique and creative and executed well. Can be somewhat heavy handed at times, but I guess thats just the American way. The portions are large and shareable. I would highly recommend the lobster panna cotta, and the dock confit main!   My only pet peeve is that the waitress couldn't properly pronounce foie gras and kept saying \"The Fois of the day...\" which irked me to my bones.  Overall I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Been there a few times now and always had a great time. Very fun atmosphere, especially if you can sit out on the balcony. The only thing that keeps it from 5 stars is on a couple of our visits it tool a little long for  the servers to engage us. Once they did though the service was great."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after a negative experience at a nearby comedy club. I immediately loved the decor and ambiance. With the encouragement of the server I tried their espresso martini and it was perfect! We ordered the house plate for something to munch on with the drinks. A nice variety of cheese and dried meats was accompanied by nicely seasoned toasted bread. Although I didn't sample any, they have a large selection of scotch and whisky, and tempting flights.  The selection of music was kept at a volume that allowed conversation to flow easily without having to yell. Overall I highly recommend this place for a comfortable night of drinks and conversation."}
{"text":"I would of given this restaurant 5 stars except a few misses.  Mainly to do with the service and the bar area.  I had made a reservation, thought I would go early to sit at the bar for a drink which was not happening.  Only 4 or 5 seats - Admittedly,  it was Saturday night and March.  We did go next door to that bar and have a drink there first.  It was also very crowded and that bar is quite large.  Back to restaurant- we sat on patio which is a very pleasant experience, quiet and cozy.    Our waitress was super sweet, but could of been a bit more attentive to details, no offer of the fish special or additional drinks.   The food was on par, better than typical restaurants in the area.   We had the chef's meat platter (would order again), burger (very good)  & pasta (good but not great)"}
{"text":"I'll have to check out the regular menu and see what kind of portions you get to confirm, but for now this place gets a 4 star rating from me.  It's a very cozy but well-designed bar atop Gelato Spot.  Its really neat the way they have a viewing glass sky light type thing that looks into the Gelato Spot from the restaurant as well.  They also have a patio that we were able to enjoy because it's still not too hot.  Not the loveliest view, but definitely interesting being able to look down at the comings and goings of Scottsdale Rd.    The staff was VERY attentive.  Can they be a little less attentive?  Maybe just a smidge..  but it was mostly a nice attentive.  On the other hand dinner took about 2 hours.  It was the 3 course for restaurant week, but there were long gaps in between courses.  Not overly annoying tonight, but we were glad we didn't have any other plans.  For 1st course we had the beet mix and the quail.  Both were very delicious and presented beautifully.  The next course was scallops and chicken for us.  The scallops were done perfectly and seasoned pretty well.  I wish more potatoes came on the platter, less carrots but other than that no complaints.  Maybe some arugula or some green would have been pretty.  It was still one of the best scallop dish I've ever had.  The chicken worked less well, we thought the blue cheese though spotty was a bit strong.  It also needed a little more salty meat - sausage or more prosciutto maybe?  The last but not least course was foie gras and veal chop.  It was actually our first time tasting foie gras - though I don't think we'll ever miss it, it wasn't bad and I believe it to be a solid representation of the delicacy.  The veal was tasty, presented nicely in slices over some grainy base.  This dish was also very good but could have used a little sweetness (cranberries?).  All in all, this was a very enjoyable dinner with dishes that were well thought out.  Everyone we talked to were helpful and not pretentious at all which was refreshing.  We're glad we tried it out.  Happy hour didn't seem to include any food items which was disappointing as we're not big drinkers, but I think I would like to return to try some more offerings even at regular pricing."}
{"text":"This place exceeded our expectations. We were treated so well, from check in until we left...very happy and very satiated.   Our server Beth was incredibly sweet, kind and knowledgeable. The owner came out and introduced himself...made us feel at home and made us laugh. Now we're feeling like family. The drink selection is phenomenal. We really enjoyed the Rye \"tasting flight\" idea. Boy, now we want to find a bottle of the Booker's Limited Edition...Wow. If anyone knows where we might find one to buy let me know.   And now the food. It was better than anything else we've enjoyed in Scottsdale, and we've had some 5 star meals. The attention to ingredients, just the right seasoning and play on flavors...they know what they're doing. Thank you Jason and Jordan. Exemplary job in the kitchen.   Bottom line...run, don't walk to the Second Story and treat yourself to a culinary delight. Tell them Ron and Greg sent you. Bon Appetit and Cheers!"}
{"text":"Not a martini bar (though it showed up on that search on Yelp). Limited menu (seafood shipment didn't make today). Maybe for a whiskey oriented crowd? I can't think of reason to go back here (there are better whiskey bars) ."}
{"text":"Love the dark, speakeasy vibe of the place. Have been wanting to check this place out, and finally got the opportunity. Great staff, great cocktails, great ambience. I can't wait to return and try the food!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time during restaurant week. Although the menu was limited for the week, every course we were served was beautiful and flavorful. Falafal with whipped feta, pork belly lettuce wraps and sea scallop with farro risotto. Many people come for the cocktails (it's a little noisy), but it's worth staying for the food!"}
{"text":"Sad it took us so long to actually try this place.  Yes, it's above the Gelato Spot so you're probably thinking, how great can it actually be?! It's that great.  Super private, small, smells of rich Mahogany (kidding but not kidding), and a breathe of fresh air in Old Town Scottsdale.  Be prepared to wait a minute for drinks, but it's because they are tailored, yummy cocktails.  If you're in despo' need for a quick drink order a beer in the meantime.  Their food is so tasty also!  We've never been disappointed by any order there.  Stop by for their HH - you cannot beat it.  Oh, and they have a TV outside for any major sports game but don't expect the volume up or any loud music. It's best for quality conversations and a good vibe'."}
{"text":"Went for the first time the other night and I will absolutely be back.  We had the entire experience starting with creative and delicious cocktails.  Had an appetizer, then entrees, then dessert and coffee.  Every staff member is on point... All the time.  Impeccable service and great food."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant,. Having dined here many times with friends, it just keeps getting better.  If you haven't tried it yet, do so, you'll be pleasantly surprised.  Service is the best and VERY knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"Blonde .... \"hostess\" incredibly rude at entrance.  Didn't even need to go past the front door.  Pretentious place, no need to make a stop.  Coming from a very welcoming and fun restaurant to that, just about ruined my evening.  Thanks blondie."}
{"text":"We had a great time here, celebrating my dad's birthday. A fine, energetic vibe, and knowledgeable servers who can help you choose the right wine and nibbles. The wine and liquor selection is excellent. I will return!"}
{"text":"I have to say, the whiskey selection is hard to beat.  Several Michters, EH Taylors, and Van Winkles.  Probably haven't found a whiskey selection that good in the Valley.  The cocktail I ordered was strong, measured, and delicious.  Our Waitress was nice, she got the job done but left us alone, which for the most part is the problem as it took forever to get service once we were seated and then once we ordered our cocktails they took forever to arrive.  The bar only had two bartenders, and although quite skilled based on how good my Rye Be So Serious was, and the complexity of the What's Up Doc my girlfriend ordered.  They were either slow or slammed which is where I don't like being left alone, I want information so I can calculate my next move.  Following that you find yourself heading restroom and listening to NPR as you reflect on where the night is taking you."}
{"text":"5 star all the way....when we flew in we stopped here first for dinner...what a good decision. The head chef came out to great us and asked for our feedback on the food. We don't feel so old here either..it's not a young yuppy crowd like many downtown Scottsdale bars and restaurants."}
{"text":"Unlike a lot of yelp reviews, I don't typically do a review unless I've had more than one experience.  I have been to The Second Story Liquor Bar on multiple occasions, some by myself and some with friends. Every time I have been to this place I have yet to have a negative experience.  The staff is always friendly and is very accommodating. The concept of this place is new and refreshing. I was never a whiskey fan until John introduced me to a single barrel whiskey that I continue to drink every time I stop in.  But, in my opinion, the best part is how good the food is.  The happy hour menu like Chicken Katsu sliders is one of my favorites, to their dinner menu with the steak and crab on top, is just as good as any steak restaurant in the valley.   Keep up the good job because you've not only won me over as a patron but you also have won over my friends and theirs too!"}
{"text":"Great date night spot!  The atmosphere is sexy and cool, the staff are impeccably dressed in classy uniforms (hardly would you call them uniforms - I want one!), the bartenders were full of personality and having a blast making craft cocktails and there is a Gelato Spot downstairs, so what isn't there to like?"}
{"text":"The menu has changed drastically.  And not fir the better. Ambiance is still terrific and so is the wait staff.   But the food has become really off.  Took a party of 6 Saturday night and was truly disappointed. Lettuce wraps were awful.  Pasta with chicken had no chicken.  Salads were unremarkable.  Sorry but you guys  really slipped with this new menu.  Thank G-d there was good drinks!"}
{"text":"Cool place. Pretty much all the positive reviews are spot on. Amazing service and amazing drinks. Can't talk about the food since we went here just for drinks and man- they were right up my alley. Classic and strong. Well, I guess \"strong\" is a strong word... they highlighted the taste of each spirit and didn't mask it with sugar and a bunch of mumbo-jumbo. True speakeasy style. The decor is beautiful and the the ambiance continues with the theme.   If I had to complain about anything it would be the cliche outfits. The girls all wear flapper dresses with pearls and the guys were undone bow ties. You can still pull off the style without going all Disneyland. Also, I'm sad you can't see the outside very well from the inside. The have a couple tables outside with a view but seating is very limited. I wish they would have put bigger windows vs tiny ones.   Regardless of those minor style things I will be back for more drinks and I hope to try the food. It looks amazing!"}
{"text":"Allison, bartender. Amazing. Made me cocktail that was to die for. Atmosphere is so amazing, it's a little hideaway and it's beautiful."}
{"text":"My bestie treated me to Second Story for my birthday. We both agreed that we want more experiences as gifts. She found out about Second Story through Eater.com's 'Top 11 new places to try in Phoenix', (March 2016).  So out of a couple choices, I selected this place. We made reservations for 6:15 pm on Saturday. Good that we did, as there was a hostess outside. More for the later crowds and the unreserved. You climb a darkened, narrow staircase and turn to the right. A surprisingly cozy, lil speakeasy, whiskey bar and restaurant.  Waitresses are in lacy black tops and cute cocktail aprons with floral motif and pearls. Bar folk in button-down vests, ties, and nice slacks. Classy.  Our waitress was Jessica. She made great suggestions for appetizers to go with our drinks. It was National Bourbon month. We could try a flight of whiskeys. We opted for the handmade cocktails and sparkling water to sip and cleanse the palate. Gina had the French Revo. I had the Corpse Reviver. Our appetizers were the delicious beer bread made with porter stout and fresh butter with smoked salt. OMG! I could make French Toast with this stuff. Ladies at the next table saw how much we were enjoying the bread and the delectable crab cakes. They ordered a round for themselves.These were not crab cakes but more like crab hush puppy balls. Whatever the pastry was on the outside, it's French type the waitress said, it Melted.In. Your.Mouth. And left you to savor the fresh crab and such. It was served with a butter lettuce with roasted lemon foam dressing. It was like lemony sea foam. Again, we ate it with gusto.  On to our second set of cocktails and feeling great, the restaurant started to fill up quickly. Noise level wasn't too bad and we were enjoying the music in the background.  My friend Gina had the salmon with vegetables. I think there was an avocado crema on her dish.  The fish was delicious and fell apart with your fork. Another great recommendation by our waitress, I had the pan-seared duck (yummy) with forbidden dirty rice, parsnip puree, chive oil, glazed carrots. I had never had parsnips before. It was sooooo good. I loved the duck. We also ordered another round of that beer bread.   I think our total came to about $70 per person ( 2 apps, 2 meals, 2 breads, 4 cocktails)  before tax and gratuity. It was a great birthday present!!! We rolled out of there, fat and happy. We also walked down the street to the Old Town Scottsdale shops, to walk off the buzz for a couple of hours.  Definitely coming back here again!       It's just north of Indian School on Scottsdale road, sw corner above G-Spot."}
{"text":"I do think the hostess being downstairs, either freezing or sweating her ass off, is a little weird but.... The drinks are worth the weirdness. A group of six of us has been here a couple times, and the cocktails are superb."}
{"text":"Tried to get a table at Citizens Public House with no res but the wait was over an hour. So we walked over to this spot and I must say the service was phenomenal, drinks were on point, and food was awesome. Def have the filet sliders, best I've had."}
{"text":"What a great experience! Visiting from San Diego and we were referred from a local. From start to finish it was an A+. Service was above average and the food was delish! Stuffed calamari, soup, lamb chops, sea bass, short ribs, steak and run cake were all amazing....not a bite left. Creative cocktails too!"}
{"text":"So there is no denying this is a cool place! The vibe upstairs is cool, drinks are great and the food we had was good as well. Make sure if you plan going make a reservation, they don't want to let you in without one. There is a bar but with like4 chairs and no standing room. The only weird thing about the need for reservations is there are constantly at least 5 open tables. Anyhow, cool place I would recommend but make sure you call ahead."}
{"text":"Creative, delicious food. Very nice decor and friendly staff. Sarah was polite, quick and helpful"}
{"text":"My first and, so far, only visit to this place was a real treat. I was taken here by my boyfriend for a celebratory, indulgent dinner, since I had had graduated in December from ASU. It was a Thursday night, but we made a reservation anyway - just in case. We had never been here before and didn't know what to expect.   Even at 7pm on a Thursday we were one of maybe 3 occupied tables. Im not sure if it was the cold weather or a weekday but we were some of the only people there that night. I didn't mind; I appreciated that it was quiet and calm. The introvert in me was just so pleased! The venue was small but very classy and upscale looking. I was happy that we had picked such a cozy smaller upscale dining experience.   We were absorbed in the drink menu! There were so many things I wanted to try. I'm a mule fan and read good things about them here, but decided on a champ cocktail instead; we were celebrating after all. My bf ended up getting a mule which was very tasty. My French 75 was perfect - citrus-y, sweet with the tang of gin, just lovely.   For food we started with a mushroom flatbread. I'm a fan of mushrooms so I thought it was amazing! Savory, a little sweet, yummy cheese and crisp bread. The truffle oil was a really nice touch. I would have eaten another one of those for my dinner. But they had scallops. Scallops are my favorite thing to order at a nicer place because scallops are either amazing, or not. And nice places make amazing scallops. I was not disappointed! They were to die for. Nothing beats really good scallops for me and I was in heaven!    Overall it was a lovely night. We had an intimate, quiet, absolutely delicious dinner, and the service was attentive, but gave us space. The only downside was there was only one desert offered, and it just didn't spark my interest (luckily Gelato Spot is just downstairs). I loved it and would definitely be back to indulge some more and try other dishes that sounded just as good."}
{"text":"If you want an intimate place to hide out with your date this is a good choice. Low lights, and small. Never overcrowded and very chill. The drinks are good and so is the food. I love that even though its right in old town that it's quaint and not crowded."}
{"text":"I have been using Yelp for about 5 years and this is the first time I have ate somewhere and felt like I would be an ass for not reviewing. This is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. Instead of pretending like I knew what to order I just let the chef pick. Every selection was spot on and the bartender paired the order with a great whiskey. If you are in Scottsdale you have to try it. The atmosphere is great for customer meeting or a date night. I will be back again!!!!"}
{"text":"General manager Vincent and server Nicole were outstanding.  They completely catered to our tastes, and substituted a beautiful dish for another beautiful dish simply because I was \"offset\" by the presentation.  I have never been so picky before,  and also never so catered to.  They listened to what we were looking for on the menu and made excellent suggestions. The drink menu, which is regularly changing, was creative and delicious, we tried several. :)  The short ribs were insanely good and the  Ahi seared to perfection.  Thank u guys for the outstanding service! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Booooooom! Five stars...no questions! If you don't LOVE this place, then you're retarded! We started our all night, Scottsdale journey around 4:00 (we were in for a long night). John the mixologist (not bartender) was awesome. This man knows his stuff. Me made a rum punch made of Appletons rum which made me wanna slap my momma (ask for it). If you haven't tried it, get on that Hibiki 12. They have it here.  The food was really good too. It was happy hour so we had multiple orders of the lobster corn dogs & the filet mignon sliders. I would only eat them during happy hours. The flavors are great but not worth the regular price for my (non-scottsdale) budget. I would definitely come back for the food & drinks but mainly to listen to John talk about makung awesome drinks. I might make one of those classes. Check out this pic of the rum punch!"}
{"text":"Great place for an intimate dinner and good conversation. Fare was great, their Beer Bread is addicting! And their Chef's Board is one of the best I've had. Hanger Steak was good, but my favorite item is on their late night menu (only available Monday-Wednesday) if I'm not mistaken, but it's a Dry Aged Buffalo Burger and some of their Noble Bread Burrata, paired with one of their craft cocktails (my favorite is the Boulevardier) it's certainly a fine dinner. Location is great and the view from the patio is refreshing. Definitely a fan of the prohibition style decor and the staff is very swanky!  I have to revise this after trying their Cardamom Crusted Duck and their Wagyu Hanger Steak (apparently not the same as the one I originally had during restaurant week, much better this was)."}
{"text":"We stopped in here last weekend for a couple cocktails before meeting friends out in the town. The interior is sexy, drinks perfectly balanced, and the new food menu looked amazing; we'll definitely be back to eat!"}
{"text":"We like Second Story for their selection of bourbons, whiskeys, Scotch, etc. The service is quite good and the atmosphere is lively and fun. Here's the rub: we've been 3 or 4 times in the last few months, most recently last night. The ladies at the entrance usually give us an inflated wait time. We have gotten around it on past visits but last night it seemed legitimately busy and we were told 45 minutes. Our choice was to make a reservation or put our name in and wait. We were also told they're strict about the reservations and we had to ask what did that mean? She was evasive then I asked if they likely take our credit card # and charge a minimum fee for a no show to which she agreed. We put our names on the wait list and then went right next door for our 45 minute wait, only to be called in 10 minutes. We had just gotten a cocktail and could not immediately return so we thanked them for the call but declined the table.  It appears as though the place tries to exaggerate its exclusivity by managing this way. There is obviously a disconnect bw upstairs seating and downstairs hostessing. If it were a one-time thing, I wouldn't have balked, but that's not the case. They either need someone more mature or professional as a hostess and/or refine the approach."}
{"text":"This was a surprisingly modern/cool spot to grab a bite before going out. The dishes were very light with great presentation. The atmosphere was great. It had an old town feel with a fine dinning experience . If you choose to come on the weekend make sure to make a reservation. The place gets very crowded and there are no spots at the bar to stand and grab a quick drink."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place while waiting for our 7 pm dinner reservations at the Mission. Very happy we stopped by! Fantastic atmosphere, service and drinks were very good! We will be back."}
{"text":"The place definitely one of the best in Old Town.  We both had the 5 course tasting menu.  Stand outs were the foiegras, the duck, and the sea bass.  Great flavor, flawless execution.  Excellent cocktails.  If you happen to go for their late happy hour, their Uni Pasta is really tasty as well.  They also have a legit cocktail menu as well.  Really too much to list.  High class food at reasonable prices considering the execution and the quality."}
{"text":"Oh.  My. This place has top notch food and drinks. Not a lot of space so make reservations or go early. I'm definitely going back. This place is definitely special."}
{"text":"The food is good it didn't blow my socks off but it was yummy. I did LOVE the atmosphere however it's small, dark, and cozily lit for a perfect romantic dinner and drinks date"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Scottsdale for a long weekend with another couple and we were looking for somewhere good to go eat on Saturday night.  We found Second Story Liquor Bar on Yelp....and the high reviews couldn't have been more right!  When we walked up the stairs to the restaurant we were immediately struck by the decor and ambience.  It felt like a 1920's speakeasy.  Even the wait staff were wearing dresses that would have fit in during that era. Every detail seemed to have been considered!  And then the food.....OH.MY.GOD.  It was AMAZING.  We decided to do a bit of grazing and share several small plates and a couple of entrees so that we could try more items off the menu.  We started with the Twice Baked Croquettes and the Burrata Caprese.  My mouth just started watering again when I typed those names.  The croquettes were perfectly cooked, filled with ham and manchego and with an amazing creme fraiche on the side.  The burrata.....oh, the burrata!  The cheese was silken and delicious, the tomatoes were fresh, the balsamic glaze was perfection, and the bread was so good that we raved about it to the owner!  I've never had simple bread taste so good before.    We continued with the Chef's Board (yum!) and then two of the Pork Belly Sausage Pasta (really unique and delish).  We finished with the Rum Cake and we were fighting over who got the last bite of the cake and the accompanying espresso whipped cream.  SO GOOD!    On top of all that, the drinks were on point.  Seriously, you cannot go wrong going to SSLB!"}
{"text":"Update: Yes I know you guys follow AZ laws, I was just saying that she checked my ID and didn't acknowledge that it was my birthday. She clearly didn't check it throughly. I don't need you to remedy anything as our server didn't try to on 2/22. The service was terrible and I wanted to voice that. Thank you."}
{"text":"This is an awesome spot to sit down and have a cocktail with a friend.  Highly recommend their old fashion and mint julep as both were well prepared and made for great conversation.  Service was good; however, they should change their attire which I felt was distracting and not in a good way!"}
{"text":"I came here because I was leaving a nearby event and my group was hungry. I used by trusty yelp app to find a nearby place with good reviews. For a casual dinner (we were dressed up but this wasn't date night or anthing) this place was overkill but the data on yelp seemed to be a fit. The Yelp data needs correction. This is not a $$ restaurant. This is at lease a $$$. They have several courses for their meals and the owner advised their proteins are flown in fresh so that would also influence the price.   The waitress was very accomodating but the hostess was pretty stuffy (I understand the hostess was replaced so that is a good thing.) I am not frugal. I just do not typically dine at these places because I don't need 4-5 course meals or high-end proteins on average days. After looking over the menu I realized yelp's mistake, paid for my drink and went a few doors down the street.   I understand The 2nd Story Liquor Bar has happy hour and late night drink specials so that helps. I didn't have a perfect experience but what I did experience but I understand some things were corrected since my visit.   I probably would have stayed and enjoyed it if the 2nd Story had some lower cost alternatives on the menu for average nights."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in old town! WTF biscuits and tuna were outstanding. Great bourbon selection. The New York strip was tender and juicy. Atmosphere is cozy, romantic, and the staff was attentive. Highly recommend trying this place before the word gets out and you can't get a table."}
{"text":"Cool place for a cocktail and app and to enjoy people watching or the great views of Scottsdale!  Staff is kind and the drinks are very unique.  Best bourbon in town and pretty fancy food that is always different and plated beautifully.  You may miss it, so look up, it is \"second story\" and above the Gelato Spot.  Must try when you are in Oldtown Scottsdale."}
{"text":"First trip up to second story last night. Had an awesome time. The food, service, and overall experience were all great. They have a great drink menu including for rare whiskeys, we went for some Parker's heritage bourbon. Food standouts were the biscuits, the meatballs, the mussels, and of course the NY strip. I would highly recommend this place and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Not impressed as the #1 Yelp Happy Hour.  Kinda cool, great selection of bourbon, but happy hour is weak.  No food and minimal drink specials.  Ordered their 'small plate, lower price point' (their explanation for no hh food specials) salad-  after 30min wait cancelled order and left.  May try again for a night cap, but never again for hh."}
{"text":"It was good enough to come back twice in the same week, and I'll probably hit it again the next time I'm in town. Cool ambiance, fancy cocktails, great staff, comfy seating, just a really cool place."}
{"text":"Aliza was awesome tonight, I don't know if there is anyone in Scottsdale that knows more about bourbon than she does! This place is something that you must go and visit!"}
{"text":"This place offers great drinks as well as atmosphere! The DOs: Chilean sea bass ceviche, soy sesame glazed smoked pork belly confit, oxtail confit and butter poached sea bass. The DONTs include anything minced and shaped into a circle. Examples include: kobe beef tartare nicoise and salmon potato cakes."}
{"text":"This is the best food in Phoenix!  I was in on Saturday night.  I had the five course tasting menu.  First course was the ahi chopped salad.  It was so fresh and the aroma was incredible.  I could smell all the ingredients.  Second course was the clam chowder.   Amazing.  The crab was fresh and the chowder was creamy.  Third course was the snapper.  The skin was perfectly crispy.  Fourth course was the chicken tandoori.  Every bite was a flavor explosion. Last course was the pineapple cake.  Not great but okay.  The cake was dry and the flavor combo didn't work for me.  Overall this was the best food experience I have had in Phoenix.  I'll be back again when the menu changes.  So happy to see a young creative chef succeeding!"}
{"text":"Absolutely beautiful. They play old Paul Harvey stories in the bathrooms. Food is pretty, that's about it. Food is disappointingly bad, and cocktails will only be appealing to whiskey lovers. The large ticket presented at the end is eye popping, so it's not even worth the view."}
{"text":"Great place!  Cozy!  The bartenders are carftsmen with making drinks.  Everyone, from the hostess to the bartenders, gave great service and were friendly. I enjoyed the drinks so much I never got around to eating.  :).  I will go back and try to eat next time as the food we saw looked good."}
{"text":"What a cool place!! When we walked up to the restaurant they had a matradee that took us up this awesome stairwell, they had a whole hidden book case, and the dinner room was illuminated with melting candles. We sat on the wrap around patio which over looked the streets of Scottsdale and enjoyed some of their hand crafted cocktails and closed the night with their amazing better than butter cake rum cake. The prices are pretty high, yet I didn't have a chance to try any of entrees. They have a changing menu every six week but I cant wait to come back and try their unique dishes!"}
{"text":"Nice spot to pick up late night cocktails. We stopped by on a Thursday night and it was moderately busy. The bar is right above the Gelato Spot (no you can't bring your Gelato in, they are not affiliated). The appetizer menu is okay, but don't come too hungry-it's not really about the food. Most of the drinks here are Whiskey based. They have a great selection on the Whiskeys, plus some wine/beer and a few other liquor mixed drinks thrown in. Prices range from $14 cocktails to $100 on the higher end Whiskeys glass. Service is fast.   Mary Kate at the front door is sweet and will get you setup! No reservations necessary."}
{"text":"Very surprised about the level of food quality, service, ambiance and everything about this place.  All food items were beautifully presented, and tasted better than they looked.  Our server was knowledgeable, friendly, and made us feel very comfortable.  Great timing bringing everything out.   Venue was intimate, yet energetic at the same time.   Worth trying out if you haven't yet.  I plan on coming back soon, mostly to see what amazing dessert creation the chef comes up with for the day."}
{"text":"The owner Tommy Plato one of the most accommodating restaurant owners ever. He went out of the way for me and my date to accommodate us today. True class act and gave me hope that there is still true customer service that restaurants lack in today's society."}
{"text":"A spin off of an old speak easy with mixology to the max... I sat at the bar and had the bartender's mix off of an old fashioned.   Great spot, location and ambience.  I will return."}
{"text":"I was really excited about coming here, at first.  Then I realized that the $26 dollar meat and cheese board was the worst \"board\" I have ever seen. They \"forgot\" to mention they were out of the pate and didn't replace it with anything. For $26 (and I do not care about the price as far as the food is good) it was just about the worst rip off I've experienced dining at a restaurant. The beet risotto was good, and the drinks were okay too. Expect the fact that the corpse reviver tasted like an aviation....."}
{"text":"The wife and I had date night here, and we loved it.  First let me say the decor of this place is so cool.    The staff was attentive.  Our waitress delivered a few cool stories about the menu.   The menu is really interesting.  There are little twists and additions that are in the dishes that really enhance the full flavor.  Tons of choices to pick from.  Since there are so many choices I highly recommend the tasting menu.  I did the 5 course and my wife did the 4 and we picked a few different options to share.  My 5 course came with a dessert. The description of the desert sounded good, but I didn't really like it.   Had I liked it I think it would have pushed this to a 5.  The drinks at this place are awesome.  I had a chocolate Manhattan and a mule, both were awesome.  My wife had this punch drink which she didn't like but then tried the pineapple champagne drink which she loved and had 2 of.   They took the punch off the menu, and I will say you can recognize a good restaurant because they took it off the bill without us asking, it was just an unspoken thing.  We got a few visits from a manager, and one from the owner Tommy.  Love the personal touch.   Definitely would go back to this place. Fyi it is spendy, but you don't leave feeling it isn't worth what you paid."}
{"text":"I have no words to describe. This place is DOPE.  Ambience - 5 stars  Quality - 5 stars Crowd - 5 stars  Quantity - 5 stars"}
{"text":"Definitely a perfect place for a night out.  I recommend coming for drinks or dinner with a date or a group of friends.  I was searching for a great place for a group dinner because my bff was coming to visit from out of town. I was pleasantly surprised to find this amazing place on yelp.  Inside has a roaring 20's theme. The cocktails were delicious and unique. I should have written this sooner because I forgot what I ordered, but it was a champagne cocktail, something different. The food was delicious. I had a seabass slider and the caprese salad. The menu changes every six weeks, but some items are frequently available.  The huge chandelier overlooking Gelato Spot was a photo favorite.   The service was great, especially since our party of 9 arrived in small groups of 1-3.  If you are coming with a group, I definitely recommend making a reservation.  I look forward to going back on a date, for gno, or with friends."}
{"text":"Wonderful place, great atmosphere, great food, perfectly balanced drinks and friendly bar tenders! John is the best."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to go! It is located on the second floor above a pizza place. The bar setting is intimate and nostalgic. The premier \"mixologist\" not bartender, is well versed and incredibly creative. Also, she is very easy on the eyes guys.  The outside patio sits high above the main drag on Scottsdale Road through Old Town. From here you can take in all of the sites. I had the pleasure of meeting their chef and seeing his garden. Here he grows herbs, squash blossoms and much more. He is expanding it to the roof and growing so many more delectable items in a bio-sustained environment.  The interior is that old mafia feel or that Chicago Sinatra style bar. The back bar is filled with premium liquers and Single Malt Scotch's. This is a must if you are here. If you don't pop in while you are in town, you missed a great stop.   #vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"I read all the great reviews and came here based on that, but sadly to say I wasn't impressed.  The drinks were good! Very unique ideas and the waitress was informative.  The food however, was not worth the money.  If I spend $200 on a meal for two people, I expect it to compete with Mastro's, Wildfish, Olive and Ivy, etc. and unfortunately, it did not come close.  The service was great so I'll go back and give them another shot :)  Update:  I haven't had a chance to come back yet but I want to acknowledge how impressed I was with their customer service!  After my review, Tommy immediately reached out to me and encouraged me to give his restaurant another chance.  He was extremely polite and I could tell how passionate he is about his business.  Hoping to swing by for dinner really soon! :)"}
{"text":"Very cool whiskey and cocktail bar. You can smell the whiskey aromas as you walk up the steps. Nice private place with a simple menu. Very good mixologists. However, no happy hour as of 11/6/15 even though it appears on the top 10 happy hour places for Scottsdale, AZ.  **update** ask the server about happy hour not the bartender. Also the pork crêpe is fantastic"}
{"text":"One of the best Old Fashions I've had in a while.  The bartender explained how to make a purist one while giving me a history lesson.  I went there during happy hour and had 3 old fashions, the burger and the dessert of the evening.  I left extremely satisfied!  This is truly a destination spot!"}
{"text":"I set up a mystery date night for my son and daughter-in-law.  This was to be the grand finale.  I spoke with the very personable GM on the phone about having a later reservation as they were going to a play prior.  She was very accommodating, remembered it was my DIL's birthday and mentioned she has a rose for her.  Very nice touch!  They arrived and were made to feel special.  They texted me saying it was a memorable meal comparable to Binkley's!  I will be going 11/1.  Often times the restaurant week deals are not as delectable, this was not at all the case.  The décor, theme, food, service are all setting the bar for other local Scottsdale specialty bars. Thank you for making this a special occasion for all of us."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. It was dark and sexy-cozy. We came just for a cocktail and had to wait for a table as there were 7 of us but the manager greeted us and put our table together quick. We all enjoyed our brut roses, old fashions and scotch and the icing on the cake was the service. Super attentive server and the manager went above and beyond. My brother in law left his cigars on the table and the manager ran down the road to return them to him. I was super impressed and will for sure return because of this experience."}
{"text":"I forgot the write in on Wednesday but the experience was so great, better late then never. This was my first time at this. Establishment and I was very impressed with the unique menu choices, atmosphere and service. This place is worth going too and in the heart of old town as well! Great value."}
{"text":"Love the different drinks they make! All of them are delicious! The atmosphere is awesome! Perfect for date night or just wanting to grab a few drinks with friends. I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic time watching the Derby here 5/2/15! They had a special menu (derby approved) and had a fun raffle going on so everyone could be involved. It was such a cute facility and very upscale. I am excited to go back and bring my friends! For food I had the Hot Brown- it was FANTASTIC and I drank mimosas and bourbon with diet coke! Needless to say- it was a Saturday Funday!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place and atmosphere.  The service is excellent. Food is perfection.  And they change their menu every 3 months I believe.  John the bartender is so nice and helpful; with helping you decide a good drink.  If you are a guy and want to impress your lady this is the place! Perfect for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"We only stopped in for a cocktail. There was no one at the front, bottom of the stairs so we started walking up the stairs. A flumoxed looking man approached us at the top....\"uh,..um....can i help you? do you have reservations?\"....i'm not sure why we were so odd looking to him.   anyway, we did not have reservations...but another gentleman was able to seat us at a table. our DD wanted something other than water, but the waitress said they didn't have anything non-alcoholic Except water. Hmm. the waitress was essentially just there. not good, not bad, just dropping a drink off and then we didn't see her again until we flagged her down for a check. we would've had another round, but our group got better service at another bar so we went back to it.   decor is quite impressive and so is the crowd...very pretty and good looking people.   maybe just an off night for our server."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time attending a special event. It is a cozy little place with a balcony overlooking Scottsdale Rd.  The bar is stocked with an impressive selection of whiskey, along with a very great bartender, who knows her stuff. My Manhattan was perfect!  I got to sample a few of their appetizers including the \"world\" famous the WTF biscuits - which were deadly good, the sliders and my favorite- the Spicy Asian Tuna on Crispy Stick Ricre! They were incredible.   Tommy, the owner was on site, and is very personable and makes you feel welcome.  I plan to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"2nd Story...I love 2nd Story!!!  This place is on of my favorite places to sit down, sip on a cocktail & watch all the people meandering around Scottsdale below.  You can sit at the bar inside (which is actually quite nice); or, if your lucky, you can score a table outside on the 2nd story patio.  They have a happy hour that ends at 5:30 (at least when I have been there), so might want to head in before then to take advantage of the lower pricing.  I still have not tried the food, but it looks and sounds very good. They are one of the few places in town that serve Marrow.   Next time I will give it a try and report back for Ya'all!   In the meantime I recommend checking them out for yourselves.  I don't think anyone will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great spot for a date, girls night or just because you feel like eating GREAT food and sipping on a super fantastical cocktail. Me and some girlfriends went for dinner and were not disappointed. The Chef came to the table which was a great treat!   I will be coming back here just as often as I can!"}
{"text":"Did not see the first response and just saw the update. We were there on Saturday May 12 at around 6pm. I don't know our waitress' name but we sat on the back wall across from the bar on the kitchen side of the banquette."}
{"text":"First off, I am not a 20-something who regularly hangs out in Old Town.  But, I have lived in Phx for 30+ years and have been to most upper-level eating establishments around town.  We went with friends for Restaurant Week.  We will not be heading back any time soon.  Service was very attentive.  The ambiance has been overstated by many other reviewers - it's got a little bit of kitsch, but in the end, the tables are extremely close to each other and the noise level is on the high end.  It is definitely not an intimate dining experience.  The food was very good, but not home run material.  The entree of venison that I ordered was served raw on the inside.  I'm not talking a little bit on the rare side, it was sashimi raw.  Having not been asked how I would like my meat prepared, I assumed it would be cooked.  I'm a medium-well kinda guy, but my dining partner likes her meat medium rare and she sent hers back to be cooked.  We ordered a dessert of foie gras and donuts, and it was just weird.  All 4 of us tried it, but none of us liked it.  You must really have to like foie gras to enjoy this dessert.  We are not really cocktail kinda people, but they did look tempting.  The regular menu looks like it is probably over-priced for the serving sizes that we got during Restaurant Week, but it was worth trying once."}
{"text":"So, I'll admit, by the time we got here I was dead tired. We had been traveling for 7 days and this was our last stop before catching our flight. Went here based on the Yelp reviews and it really wasn't our thing. Wonderful whiskey selection. Great suggestion by the waitress when I told her I like single malt Scotch with little to no peat. She offered something I had never had and I thoroughly enjoyed it. We sat on the patio which was LOUD. The street is right there and the cars going by made conversation a little difficult (as did the table of drunk ladies). The decor was beautiful. Very 1920's inspired and well done, not tacky. We did not eat anything because the prices are very high. Even the appetizers were pricey. If we were planning a \"nice\" night out, I could see coming here again, ordering food and not being put off by the $19 neat Scotch, but as it stood, it was not what we were expecting."}
{"text":"Step back into prohibition with Michelin stars. Old school cocktails. Classy service. Bananas Foster can only be described as perfect. Not a word used often in my reviews. Stepping back out into Old Town after is a culture shock. Stop in and impress your first date or treat an old friend."}
{"text":"This is an up and coming bar. Hopefully they will continue to have the clientele they are centered around. We loved the bartenders as they seemed very knowledgeable and down to earth. Mixed drinks good and centered around Bourbon and whiskey which was different. Location nice, upstairs of course :) but looks down a Gelato shop which was different. A good place to have a fancy drink after dinner. And they don't only have ginger beer drinks :) we will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I've been waiting for it to open since I saw it pop up on Yelp and now I'm sitting here, with a New England Mule, with my friends, enjoying the rooftop view of Scottsdale.  This place REALLY puts effort into detail. They use specific ice for different drinks to make the drink the way it should be made! They also have a menu that looks KILLER. We didn't eat but I could smell the food and can't wait to go back to test it out.  If you want an awesome ambiance and a place to go try something different in Scottsdale, this IS your place. Also, the owner and servers are on point! I'll stop talking, just go!"}
{"text":"I believe that the true worth of a serious drinks place lies in how good their Old Fashioneds are.  SSLB gets full marks. Excellent drinks, yummy appetizers and indulgent waitresses dressed in lace and pearls all set in a Mad-Men themed bar. While the inside is luxurious and has a speakeasy feel, the balcony has a cool vibe and offers great views of Old Town Scottsdale and it's interesting people. Try the Sazerac or Old-Fashioned with the truffled mushroom flatbread. You know what would have given it bonus points?- Don Draper on their menu :)"}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here and I got lucky that night.   Fantastic establishment. Everything from the Decor to the menu to the extensive liquor list is thoroughly thought out and perfectly executed.   I would recommend this as a date spot and not as a spot to attend with large groups of friends. It works better with parties of 4 or less. The food is phenomenal. I ordered the 5 course dinner with the Inside Out Caprese, The Venison, The Sea Bass and two other things that were phenomenal (I can't remember because at that point the Whiskey kicked in.) I made loud noises every time I took a bite.   Also it is important to note that not only is the food outstanding, but they have an impressive wine and liquor list. I think the waitress said they had 70 different kinds of whiskey. I ordered the Commodore which was a mixture of Whiskey Lime & Lemon and it was out of this world.   If you are taking your girl on a date go here!"}
{"text":"I've dined at Second Story probably close to ten times and this was my favorite restaurant in the valley.  After having been there for the first time since Chef Rusticus's departure, unfortunately that's no longer the case.  The menu is nowhere near as interesting, some dishes were good, some not and the service seems to have taken a bit of a dive.  I don't get the seemingly new focus on vegetarian dishes in a \"whisk(e)y bar\".  Veggie charcuterie?  Sure, it shows technique but it's not something I want with a boozy meal.  I really missed the old chef's board, among many other things.  Here's the rundown:  Shishitos - everyone in the valley is doing these and these were the worst I've had.  Not gross, just boring and bland.  Under-seasoned and the pairing of tomatoes and balsamic didn't work at all.      Fry bread sliders - tasty, but the chorizo was dry, which I didn't think was possible to do.  Rabbit tamales - bland, dry meat on the inside with dense, chewy masa on the outside.  The sauces on top were equally flavorless.    Ham and cheese - amazing.  This was the saving grace.  It was smokey, tangy, rich and the $6 fries added on were worth every damn penny.  I'll come back just for this dish.  The pretty, pearl-covered servers were friendly, but multiple times plopped dishes down in front of us without explaining what they were and grabbed empties off the table without asking if we were done, or saying anything for that matter.  Bar service was slow, but they absolutely know how to make a good cocktail.  I was hoping that my old standby could maintain it's quality, creativity and taste despite the departure of its creative force, but it's not the same place it was.  Still, a decent spot, just don't expect it to live up to experiences from several months back.  Hopefully they can right the ship.  We need places like what this one used to be."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Rihanna ft. Kanye West & Paul McCartney - Four Five Seconds)  I think I've had enough I might get a little drunk I say what's on my mind This place brings me back in time Cause all of my reviews Is singing for Yelpers  Now I'm Yelping Second Story Liquor Bar! And I got 5 more stars till Friday I'm just trying to munch and write by Monday morning I swear I wish somebody would tell me Ooh, that's all I want   This place is totally cute and sauve. I came here with my Yelp friends after a party with the gang.  Second Story Liquor Bar is on the 2nd floor obviously and almost felt like a speakeasy as we climbed the stairs.  There was a band playing some jazz while you can hear murmurs among the crowd.  It was dark indeed.  As we sat we all ordered a cocktail to start.  They had some old fashion cocktails from the hey days of the 20s and 30s, but also some modern takes on some of them.  For our food I went for the Cockles & Mussels; a saffron tomato broth with a polenta base while the cockle clams and mussels were littered around.  Overall, definitely a cold weather bite since it helped warmed the soul.  My friends ordered the Buttermilk & Teff Pasta and the Foie Gras.  I had a bite of the teff pasta and thought it freshly made, but very clean and it gave me a healthy feel.  The star of the night for me was the Foie Gras; beautifully plated with a towering milk bread with toasted coconut and passion fruit.  The duck was cooked to perfection with a light toasty crunch shell.    Overall, I like Second Story Liquor Bar because the ambiance is very chill and a place I can definitely hangout for a drink or two.  The food is unique and presented very well.  In the end, this is my new ace! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"One of the (many) awesome things about Yelp is the opportunities to meet new friends and eat! I was fortunate enough to be invited here by fellow (way cooler) Elite, Bao H. It had been a while but the space was just as cool as I remember it. The speakeasy vibe makes you feel very Madmen-esque. We got a great spot in the corner and grabbed a cocktail to start. I opted for the whiskey sour (felt mandatory). It was smooth and strong, definitely dangerous if consumed in large quantities! The roasted carrot fondue was recommended to us so we opted for that as our starter. I LOATHE carrots but sweet baby Jesus! This was incredible! Not carrot-y at all and deliciously spicy. The Corn Flake gratin added the necessary crunch. It was served with bread cubes and assorted fruit/veggies. 10/10 would recommend. For my entree I went all in and ordered the ribeye (rare of course). Aside from home cooked steak it was one of the best I have ever had. Bao ordered the seasonal pasta with chorizo and I was fighting for a bite! I'm not normally a big pasta girl but this was a killer recommendation by the server. For my second cocktail I went with The Conquistador {Elijah Craig Small Batch Bourbon | Amontillado Sherry | Lemon | Spiced Tea | Allspice Dram | Egg White} and it was just as awesome as the whiskey sour but the lemon added a great tang. I wouldn't change a thang!"}
{"text":"Had a gift certificate won at an Elite Yelp event held here.  With it in hand, took a partner in crime here for dinner.  We had a bit of a wait so sat outside around the \"fire\" waiting for my name to be called.   Once inside, were seated facing the balcony.  Perused the wine and bar menus and I decided to get the Don Draper Rye Flight and he got the house old fashioned.   Each drink in the flight is an ounce.   I decided I liked the Knob Creek Rye the best.  The other two actually tasted the same -- I thought.  For dinner I ordered the new york strip, with its accompanying carrots, mushrooms and greens.   I was told the steak was 10 ozs., and he ordered the chicken and mushroom pasta.     I am thinking I probably should have asked what the price of the 10-ounce strip was.  It turned out to be $50.   I mean, it was good, but $50???    At this restaurant???   The sauce was creamy, and went well with the veggies.  I tasted his pasta.   It was good.  I was not impressed with the presentation, though.   I don't know.   I couldn't put my finger on it, but the way it was presented in the bowl (see my photo) was, well, different. ... Or interesting. ...  Lori was our server.  Efficient, professional and friendly.   Tommy, the owner, stopped by.  When I got the bill, my tablemate noticed the flight was $35 versus the $25 advertised.  We brought this to Lori's attention, and she took $10 off my bill.  We were thinking it would be nice, when the weather is just perfect for doing so, to sit on the balcony inside the lights as they draped down.     I may go back.  It is a small place, so expect to wait.   I think total it seats 80.   It sits above a pizza, gelato restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of people at work. While I was every excited to try Second Story, I was reluctant to bring everyone here because I was sure that no matter how great this place was, SOMEONE was going to hate it. Well, hell has literally frozen over because all 6 of us left, utterly happy and amazed with our experience.  This small, cozy spot has a cool, sexy speakeasy vibe with a nice little bar and a few tables some of which overlook the pizza joint below. They have a rotating menu but I was able to enjoy one of the best caprese salads I've ever had with smooth, light mozzarella, tangy pesto and delicious greens and tomatoes.  For my main, I had the filet, which served up a tender and succulent medium rare, and accompanied with scalloped potatoes, carrot frites and grilled vegetables. I also got to try some of the the stellar buttermilk fried chicken. I'm not a lamb eater but the most critical eater in our group thoroughly enjoyed the lamb so if that's not a raving endorsement, I don't know what is.  Our gorgeous servers were gracious and attentive, their hand-crafted cocktails were amazing and the atmosphere was sexy and classy. This is hands down one of the best discoveries I've made in a while and it's all thanks to Yelp.  I can't recommend this place enough-great for a date night or for a group. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Super delicious. Josh the Chef really knows what he is doing with the flavors. Daniella my maître d' was amazing and precise with her choice of meal as I let her choose."}
{"text":"Very cool upstairs place.  Kind of a speakeasy type place.  If the weather is nice grab a table outside and watch the cars and people go by for entertainment.  My friend had a manhattan which she said was good.  My ricotta gnocchi was hit and miss.  The gnocchi was great but the acorn squash was too charred.  Oh well, I'll give them another try for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Didn't even know that this place existed until a week ago. It's such an amazing dining experience. The food is small portions for the price but the taste is simply amazing.   Drinks are different than most places which is good, it's not bad to change things up. Limited beer menu but they have good choices.  The dinner menu is fairly robust and the drink menu is extensive!  No deserts, but it's not needed since they are right below the best gelato in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Amazing drinks, great recommendations from the owner, delicious food. Couldn't have asked for a better ladies night out!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, great atmosphere, and service... Definitely recommend this Old Town Scottsdale hidden gem."}
{"text":"Restaurant week burned our experience. We wanted appies but ended up with a 3 course mediocre experience. Too bad. So disappointed. :( and our blonde attitude waitress was awful. A terrible person. Haha just read the response from the management, what a lie!! We were never offered any resolution or compensation. Terrible place. Never recommend."}
{"text":"We got 4 items to eat and a few cocktails. Both the food and drinks were good, but not over the top good (like they should have been for the prices.) They do have a happy hour! The cocktails were fun and unique. The atmosphere was romantic, cool decorations and dark lighting. I recommend it for a bite and a drink!"}
{"text":"Who is that girl screening us at the door frame? And wouldn't even let us look around the corner, Very poor first impression and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place! Stopped by for a late drink and snack last Saturday night at around 11pm. I was pleasantly surprised by the cocktails! There was one I had which was turmeric infused (I forgot the name) that I absolutely adored. Sat outside on the balcony over looking Scottsdale Rd. Really lovely. It was about 95° out so thank goodness they had the misters on. They provided the much needed relief from the heat! I'll definitely be back again to explore the whiskeys and perhaps other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely a fabulous experience. Intimate, candlelit speak easy feel environment. We did the 3 course with wine pairing. Daniella was a phenom on the wine selection. I loved the crab chowder and ready to forgo everything else to have more. There is not an unhappy feeling inside me as I ponder this amazing food and beverage."}
{"text":"OK, here goes. Had I written this review after my first experience I would have given it a 5 PLUS star rating. Unfortunately the second time was not up to the first. I will start by saying that we had a reservation. When we arrived 3 or our party of 4 were there and our 4th was stuck in traffic. The hostess said we could not be seated until the 4th was present. OK, reasonable! We then said then we will go up to the bar and wait for him......NO, you cant do that. OK, then just take us to our table, that was reserved, and we will get started on appetizers and drinks. Hmmmm, sorry that doesnt work! After a bit of back and fourth the hostesses agreed to escort us to our table. When we arrived to the \"second story\" there was barely a table occupied and the bar was available.  Seriously, what was the problem. Not only was the restaurant not full, tables remained unoccupied for our entire dinner.  As we sat outside trying to figure out why we couldnt be seated we assumed that the restaurant must be packed and the kitchen backed up and they were surely stalling us. NOT the case. Very strange and was not the best start to our evening. Keep in mind we had talked this place up based on our first experience.   OK, now for the service and the food. Service, outside of the incompetent hostesses, was BEYOND exceptional! Knowledgeable. friendly, understood the food and were confidant making recommendations. The food this time around was good, just not the great food we had the first time around. I couldnt wait to have the charcuterie board again, as it was one of the best we had ever had. It was still good, but was certainly less plentiful and the quality of the ingredients was not what I was promising our friends to be AMAZING. I had the short ribs and somehow I believe the chef completely neglected to salt the meat at all, which made for a disappointing dinner. Fortunately two people had the duck and loved it. Overall the meal was good, but the experience as a whole was a bit disappointing.   All said I will give Second Story Liquor Bar another chance because there really isnt anything else like this place in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"The opening of this hot new restaurant has been a long time coming...   I've seen the stairs leading up from Gelato Spot in Old Town for well over a year now, and heard the \"Cliff Notes\" version of the story for SSLB since before I noticed those stairs!  I attended a soft opening at SSLB on Thursday night and I walked away a little buzzed, with a full belly, and pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food.  It's obvious that Tommy P, owner of both Gelato Spot and SSLB, has put blood, sweat and tears into making his latest concept come to fruition.  He's put a marvelous team in place, and it's no secret that he and his staff have paid close attention to detail in everything from the design and flow of the space, the prohibition-esque atmosphere, unique hand-crafted cocktail list, creative cuisine, etc...  My group enjoyed a variety of the cocktails on the menu... I didn't see anything with vodka (my go-to), so I opted for the \"high & tight,\" a champagne cocktail made with lunetta prosecco, house bitters & sugar cubes, flamed orange peel.  It went down easy!  I get the feeling that this is the kind of place that you can just tell the bartender what you like and have him surprise you.  We also had a tasting of five different menu items.  I highly recommend the Asian Chopped Salad, the Lamb Chops, and the Scallops.  And in looking at the menu, I already know what I'll be ordering on a future visit:  the Chilean Sea Bass and the 24 hr Braised Beef Short Ribs.  If those two entrees are as fabulous as they sound in the description, I'll definitely be bumping up my review to a full five stars.  Our server was well-informed on everything we ate and gave us detailed explanations along with each course.  We somehow ended up without dessert, but the beautiful thing about this place? It's literally right upstairs from Gelato Spot, so save some room for the perfect sweet ending to the story aka your experience.  Second Story Liquor Bar will be another great addition to the Old Town dining scene... open for happy hour, dinner, and late night daily, I'll be adding it into my rotation for sure (at least for happy hour and dinner, as I rarely do late night anymore!)"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place for a while and finally got around to it. The service and ambiance is really good.  Awesome whiskey selection. Michael was great to help me find a delicious wine when the GSM was out. We tried the rabbit tamales cause, I mean how often is that on the menu??  Delicious. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this place after sampling at the AZ Taco Festival.   Liquor and Tacos.... What could be better right?? Well once seated we were surprised that this place didn't offer anything like that on their menu  They did have a taco on their happy hour menu but it wasn't happy hour.  Frownyface.   The drinks were good.  I really liked the el Diablo del sol.  Had a few of them.  The mushroom flatbread was ridiculously good.  I probably could have stayed their all night We were the only ones on the patio but we were attended to often and it was a really nice vibe  Our hearts wanted Mexican so we decided to have a few drinks and an appetizer and then go have dinner elsewhere.   I'm disappointed about the food I didn't stay to try it but I'm sure it's good I assumed that if you are at a taco festival, you do Mexican food.  I understand getting your name out there but it's just weird.   *** You're right.  It's just not what we were expecting but that's no reason to knock you. I put it to five stars because it was really a place I could drink all night.   Btw, the tacos you served at the taco festival were ridiculous good."}
{"text":"I got the chefs board and crusted duck. Oh my gosh that duck was heavenly. I haven't typically been a fan of duck but I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and am I glad I did. And as a special treat, Chef Nick sent out dessert!! He is so incredibly talented and gifted for his young age and he carries himself so well. Had a wonderful evening!!"}
{"text":"Very cool, new Whiskey Spot in Old Town Scottsdale.  You can't go wrong with an Old Fashioned here!!"}
{"text":"Got drinks at the bar. Bartender named Tyler was excellent, as was the other bartender (but I didn't catch his name). Both were knowledgeable, made great drink recommendations, and were friendly and fun. I asked for the Hemming Daiquiri with gin instead of rum and he was able to modify the drink and craft a delicious cocktail. Also, the pork belly lettuce wraps were amazing."}
{"text":"What a fantastic and unique restaurant. Unfortunately there is no vegan options on the menu but they have some wonderful drinks. The bartenders are friendly , Knowledgeable and extremely creative. I will definitely do cocktails and hopefully there will be a vegan option on the menu next time I return."}
{"text":"Best place ever.  Drinks, food, all good.  Great place to have a drink.  Tyler is awesome behind the bar."}
{"text":"Our waitress Daniella was so attentive to our needs and made some great recommendations. The atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable. Great for a romantic dinner for two or a group of friends. The food is out of this world. I'm so picky I send stuff 50% of the time, but no issues here everything was perfectly prepared and flavorful. A definite must to check out if your in the oldtown area. One of the best seabass dishes I ever had. I can't wait to come back and try something else. Make a reservation this is going to be the next hot spot on the map. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Friendly bartenders, amazing food, good energy. - Cauliflower was indeed bangin'! Love the sweet raisins. - Ricotta gnocchi with roasted squash, crispy sage, and brown butter is perfect for fall. - Octopus- this was B's request. Served with yummy white beans and some grilled broccolini. - Stuffed pasta- the best thing I've eaten in a long time. This special was not on the menu Gorgeous green pasta stuffed with goat cheese and sunchoke, served with king trumpet mushrooms.  Tyler served up some tasty tipples including a fab Trinidad sour and a fun riff on an old fashioned. He introduced me to a mezcal cocktail that sounded terrible, but was actually really good. Look forward to seeing what else he has up his sleeves on our next visit.  Speaking of which, chef says that Thursday night pasta tastings are coming soon. And B wants to go for their oysters on Wednesday. Again soon!"}
{"text":"Very sexy restaurant filled with charm and great food. I had the lamb shank, so tender it fell off the bone. They also make a killer Old Fashioned."}
{"text":"First time here.  Ordered my standard tequila and oj.  The bartender then fresh squeezed an actual orange to produce the cocktail.  Top notch!  Good music and good vibe."}
{"text":"The two star rating is because of the intimate setting that this lounge gives you. However in my option the cocktail selection is limited and the prices are way too high! I ordered a traditional sazerac and what I got was basically a glass of sugar. Will not be back, this place is a total bust. Will go to bitter and twisted instead, they actually know how to make a good cocktail!"}
{"text":"Our second time here - love the cozy atmosphere. Great cocktails and spirits list. Very good food. The rabbit tamales are especially good."}
{"text":"Well where do you start? First please ignore the grammar | spelling - I'm speeding through this on my phone....  I've been frequenting this Whiskey influencediiilliiiili Restaurant for the past two years and always feel content and joyful after my experience. The New chef has just released his first menu and he l picked up the \"Rock\" show casing his talents during Arizona Restaurant Week w a 3 course fixed menu. Two choices in each setting!   C1-The Beef Tartar was plentiful and delighting starter plate. Balanced, with acidity, salt and (vinegar or Horseradish) and I selected the Jeffersons Ocean Aged Whiskey - this is a \"Must Have\" if you enjoy unique and amazing American whiskey's C2- I went w/ the obvious choice a 5 spice crepe filled with Pork Belly and truffle oil- such a typical heavy course but the crepe and sauces dressed the dish amazingly well. I heard that C2 option #1 the Ravioli is extremely on point as well. C3- I didn't go with the I obvious first choice the \"Charred Hanger Steak.\" Instead I did the Double Fried Chicken and Crumpet with Bourbon (yes, bourbon) maple syrup!!!! This is total play on Chicken and Waffles- yet refined and delighting, hearty and filling, sweet and a hint of tang!! I paired this with the Berheim Wheated Whiskey / 90 proof / with hints of butterscotch- Toffee- cinnamon and white pepper  Can't wait to see the new menu release this up coming week  Oh and the cocktail selection?  It's amazing! Flanked left to right, ceiling to the floor with over 100 whiskeys and an array amount of the others to play the beat of anyone's palate! Oh, when I said whiskey, John \"The Whiskey Man\" Christie will lead you to promised land when exploring any whisky (ey) from the main land across the Atlantic to Scotland & Ireland. Don't forget that to get your Orient Whiskey fix too!!  My favorites in no order just a biased opinion below   From across the pond - Jameson \"Caskmates\" Irish Whiskey  Aberlour (any) Powers Gold Green Spot  Japanese  Nikki Coffee Pot (just try it - yummmm) Hibiki   American Jefferson (any) Knob Creek Rye (my dram of choice) Elijah Craig 23 Old GRANDAD OGD!!!  ***Don't judge it's the best value bar none"}
{"text":"This place is top notch. The staff is happy and smartly trained. The chef is in his twenties and is a super star already. You can not go wrong with anything on the menu. All is amazing. We loved our cocktails and entrees - steak and the short rib. Perfect for a date night with your lovie."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in Old Town with a view of the area.  Sitting on the balcony overlooking Old Town is a fantastic restaurant. The service we got there was exceptional.  Our waitress was spot on, knowing all of the details of the menu and helping us decide what to order.  We really enjoyed sitting outside and although the balcony is narrow and small, it was nice to enjoy the outdoor air.  The food was exceptional.  We ordered a couple share items which were enough for our small appetites, but then moved on to an after dinner drink and something sweet.  Normally a non traditional item, we ordered biscuits for dessert which were off the charts.  Caitlyn suggested we add the nip of Whistle Pig Bourbon Aged Maple to the dish so, of course we did.  OMG, it was heavenly!  She paired it with a special coffee drink of her choice and it was perfect.  So not to digress, but I need to mention something about the scallop dish we had because it was also amazing! Scallops tender and succulent, cooked perfectly with the most delicate and delectable array of baby vegetables. It was a special that day and it was wonderful!  Liked the experience so much, we returned with friends a couple days later.  Yep it was great then too!"}
{"text":"Me and my BF checked this place out for V-Day for there set course dinner. The atmosphere is fun and very quaint and nice to cozy up to that special someone. Service was impeccable and our dinner was delicious. Thanks for making our day of love a memorable and tasty one."}
{"text":"This is my third visit to Second Story, and this time I made sure to not drink any whiskey.  Why, you may ask?  Lets just say I am a slow metabolizer of this certain alcohol beverage and every time I come here, I have a great time.  Was it the whiskey or the service and food that produced such joy,  I would ask myself the next day.   This time I stuck to basic drinks with Tito, and I must say, this place is fabulous.    The food is creative and well done.  The speak easy concept, if not done well, could have been real cheesy, but they hit it on the nail here.  Service is always friendly, if a bit slow.  The drinks, however are the main attraction.  Mixology at its best.    The icing on the cake is the Paul Harvey retro broadcasts playing in the restrooms.  Don't forget to save room for affogato downstairs in the gelato store!"}
{"text":"Went from 5 stars to 4 with my 2nd visit. Steak was not as good as 1st time and mussels had a fishy flavor to them. Burratta caprese was fantastic though. Still great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ali makes a serious whiskey sour!!! Don't tempt Tommy with a good time or his biscuits and butter!! It's small but quaint. If you want a serious drink this is the place for you!!!"}
{"text":"Cocktails are exquisite, food superb and the ambiance is just...perfect."}
{"text":"Second Story Liquor Bar boasts a cool, relaxed ambience with the feel of a modern speak-easy. Delicious and savory dinner menu, bringing you an upscale culinary experience without the high cost. Almost makes you forget that this is a bar-driven establishment. The sections of the menu are named as if they are running seasons of a television show, which makes for an interestingly refreshing menu concept. The cocktails are all fantastic, head bartender John Christie did a wonderful job with the menu. He is one of the most knowledgable people you will ever meet and definitely a standalone reason to visit Second Story Liquor Bar."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here, drinks were great, apps were great. I had an old fashion- well, maybe I had three. The bartender was friendly and informed, the ambiance was great. There was no TV in the bar area which was a little bit of a bummer because there was a game on, but that might be perceived a positive- because there were no distractions. Great experience."}
{"text":"I came here on Friday night with my boyfriend and another friend. The dining room was full so we sat at the bar. Oh goodness, we had such a great time!! The place has such a great vibe, definitely a cute date night place. The bartenders JT and Alex were wonderful! They were very knowledgeable and so friendly. We had so much fun chitchatting with them about the different cocktails and liquors. My boyfriend and I both work in the hospitality/service industry and we were just blown away by the amazing service we experienced here. We look forward to going back and will definitely recommend this place to our friends."}
{"text":"Upscale bar. No well drinks here. All craft signature cocktails.  Food menu is also gastropub. Food was good. Chorizo biscuits and gravy topped with a fried egg. The cheese fondue was delicious. Sliders were very good!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing and yeah the atmosphere and food is great and all but the service was extraordinary.  She was so knowledgable and professional about all the food and cocktails.  I think here name is Bethany and for someone so young to provide such excellent, top notch service was a joy to see.  She is a credit to the hiring practices and to her entire generation.  Three cheers for Bethany!!"}
{"text":"Great place with really nice food, atmosphere is really nice and the staff seemed very friendly and accommodating, would absolutely recommend giving it a try, I am not a whisky or bourbon drinker which they cater to, but I still thought it was a great experience."}
{"text":"I caught them during menu transition and 105 degree weather, so things were slow.  My first two choices on the menu weren't available, so the chef improvised.  I had the Steelhead and he whipped up a veggie medley to go with it.  Very good.  I also had the shishito peppers which were great and the presentation was awesome!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for some drinks while visiting Scottsdale and we are so glad we did! All of the servers were so friendly and especially our server, Amanda, was amazing and ended up giving us so many recommendations on places to eat that were all spot on. We felt like everyone really took time to talk to us and get to know us and didn't treat us like \"just customers.\" The drinks were really good, but what we loved the most was the really great atmosphere and incredible service."}
{"text":"Fantastic vibe with great food. The hidden gem is worth visiting. Feels like a speak easy with a side entrance as you climb dark stairs to the second floor you are instantly welcome into cool dining and bar area.   Enjoyed the pork belly appetizer and steak for dinner. Fantastic meal and staff was warm and welcoming"}
{"text":"Thought I was walking into the gelato spot when hostess led me upstairs to this little piece of whiskey pleasure!  Great selection of Rye, blends, singles and Irish!  Great beer chasing selection as well. After hours menu is fantastic. The Bison burger was amazing!  Doesn't come with Sides so don't expect Fries. Get downstairs before re 11 to enjoy a little Gelato for dessert!"}
{"text":"Beautiful modern chic decor, cool cocktail selections and delicious food what a good combo. Friendly beautiful/handsome bartenders and waitresses and great vibe."}
{"text":"Second Story is one of our few 'go-to' establishments in all of Scottsdale. Everything about this place is exceptional. We had dinner there several times in the last year or so. We enjoyed it so much, we decided to have our wedding party there in mid July - an evening of dinner and drinks for about 35 people.   The owner, Tommy, is one of the nicest guys you will meet. No ego (despite his success), amazing customer service attitude, he sincerely cares about his guests and the experience patrons have.   Our event could not have gone any better. The staff treated us and our guests like royalty. The food, the drinks, the ambiance, the service - simply amazing. The chef is seriously talented. The food combinations, flavors, presentation, the taste - up there with any ultra high end place I've ever dined at. Great alcohol concoctions - very few of our guests left sober. Most people were staying at a resort in old town and Tommy even called golf carts to the restaurant to transport everyone.  Bottom line - Tommy, Josh and the staff made sure the event was a big success (so many of our guests raved about the experience). For a wonderful dinner, for drinks and apps, or if you are looking for a location for an event of any kind, I STRONGLY recommend you check out Second Story! Hands down - one of the best places in town."}
{"text":"A great place for unique craft cocktails, the Second Story is a cool little Old Town bar and restaurant that's great for an after work drink. The vibe is very prohibition area and unique compared to other Old Town spots. While I can speak mostly to the drinks, the apps I've tried have also been pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"Came here last weekend during spring training, and I definitely want to come back! This place has a speakeasy vibe to it, with great ambiance and decor.  The drinks - absolutely amazing!! The bartender/mixologist is extremely talented. We were asked what our favorite drinks were to order, and the drinks we received were very similar, but with a personalized twist to it. Hard to explain, you'll have to see for yourself!  We also ordered the pan seared rum cake for dessert. Wow that was tasty. Between the three of us we nearly inhaled it!  The owner was even walking around speaking with patrons too! It's always great to see the owner getting face time with customers, shows that he cares and wants the restaurant to do well.  Will definitely return next year when I visit for spring training!"}
{"text":"My mom and I came here. Great cocktails and the burger was one of the best I've ever had. Very underrated. Prices are a bit high but everything is high quality. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"While this was not, in fact, a typical \"speakeasy,\"  the drinks certainly lived up to the billing!  WOW!  Tried four different bespoke (menu bespoke) and my wife had one and a straight Whiskey.   All were PERFECT and delicious.  What's Up Doc was the biggest surprise.  Carrot juice and bourbon!?!?   It works!  In a great way.  And the Rye So Serious? Is another mystifying winner.  Like a chocolate-Orange  hard candy.  SO good.  Sazarac and Manhattan were perfect and exactly as requested.   Food was excellent.  Opted for lighter fare and were rewarded beautifully.  Seasonal (cold weather fried clam and corn chowder) was so good. And rabbit tamales are a MUST.  They do run out, so be prepared if that happens.    Service was impeccable.  Jodi took amazingly good care of us and I hope she is your server.  Ask for her if not.  She knows the menu, likes good drinks and is absolutely delightful.  Management is extremely interested in your having a great experience and we so appreciated that, too.  Well done.    Note:  outdoor patio seating is cute and comfortable, BUT, street traffic was obnoxious.  Loud Harley's  and (gas powered?) golf carts were a distraction.  Not a deal-breaker, but if you can score an indoor seat, it's preferable.  If not, the outdoor deal really is comfortable and cute.   Enjoy.  And, cheers!"}
{"text":"Alright where to start?  Atmosphere:  classy and modern definitely a great dating spot! Dark colors with a lot of candles that add a really nice touch to the whole place.   Service: I had a reservation for 10 people and everything was set for us! After that more of my friends started showing up and they took care of it without me saying a word they added a table and chairs really quick. Lori was our server and she went above and beyond.   Food: I've had the duck and it was really juicy and tender it was just perfect. Also every other dish that I tried on the table was above my expectations.   I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I really don't want to let this secret out, I want to keep it all to myself. This place is COOL. You don't need to dress up, but you will feel more a part of the ambience if you don't wear flip flops. I don't want to give too much away, just go and see for yourself. This is a hidden treasure like Kazbar is. Don't expect to sit at the bar, it's only a 5 seater. Love love love it here."}
{"text":"Went to The Gelato Spot to check this place out before it opened. Met the owner, Tommy and he seems like a really nice guy who cares about the quality of his business. Can't wait for this place to open in March!"}
{"text":"No other Old Fashioned will ever be good enough. These folks do drinks and eats just right. Brought the lady here for her Birthday , per her request and I gotta say, I'm reminded why we decided to get married - she's wonderful and has excellent taste.   I ordered an Old Fashioned and she got the Mint Julep. We have both had horrible renditions of our favorite drinks, but this place took excellence to a new level.   As for food, I was really worried this high class joint was going to be too culinary for me to even know what I was ordering. I was wrong. We got the burger, some pasta that they handmade, and some chorizo sliders. This meal was fit for a king.   If you're looking for good food and drink in Scottsdale and you like to keep it classy, give them a try!!   Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to dine and drink at in Old Town Scottsdale. Second Story is just above The Gelato Spot, providing a high end but, very approachable space to have drinks with friends or impress company. Jason McGrath is their very talented chef, always providing seasonal dishes with incredible detail. They also have an awesome bar program with an extensive whiskey collection.  Second Story's friendly bar staff is helpful in pairing you with the perfect craft cocktails for you nightly needs too. Definitely a place to check out!!"}
{"text":"I would say amazing little hideaway. We went during restaurant week and enjoyed the prix fixe menu. Drinks were amazing and the food \" oh so delectable\" I will definitely be back on another evening to try the full menu."}
{"text":"Loved this spot! Grabbed some seat at the bar about 10PM.  Bartenders were great guys and gave us real answers to out questions.  They clearly knew what they were doing and we got great drinks"}
{"text":"Love what the Plato's have done with the place. Jeremy the bar tender was very knowledgeable about the different types of gin available. The menu is legen-waitforit-dary! And quite witty as well."}
{"text":"Great ambience, amazing food, decent service. Food portions are small, but delicious. 4 of us split 4 things... Short ribs, scallops, pork belly and filet. Our least favorite was the filet. My personal favorite was the pork belly. Every bite was delicious. Only one dessert on the menu.. Rum cake. Also delicious, one side is pan seared. Nice touch and something I haven't seen. It's a very small space so be sure to make reservations, but book online, don't call. I made a reservation over the phone for a friend's birthday. When we arrived, there was no reservation. They were very polite, apologized and got us seated. Overall, it was a great experience and I would love to go back."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. So terribly unimpressed with this place. Great drink menu and the food looked like it would be delicious but after 20 minutes of waiting for a server to show up and repeatedly trying to request service, we gave up and left. I'm embarrassed for bringing out of town guests to a place where the service was so atrocious. There are too many choices in this town to waste your time at this one."}
{"text":"Don't come here for the food. We waited almost an hour for the main course (filet and lamb) and it was served at room temperature... And the side (risotto) was like eating pure salt. The server suggested some thing else instead but we did not wait another hour so she gave us 10% discount. The bottom line is you can find much better places in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Where's the six star?  This place is good as it can get, I've been here three times and all three times I'm met by the effervescent Brooke, who not only has a million dollar personality, she has exceptional taste in clothing. Second Story Liquor Bar, is that which reminds me of a hidden gem, the dark staircase may have there lawyers chagrin in lawsuit fear, but, for me it reminds me of going to a forbidden nightspot, mystery is often the best company and yes, the chase is better then the kill.  I love sitting at the bar, and yes these are real mixologists, there not bartenders, bartenders there most difficult drink is a rum and coke, with a lime. These mixologists make the best whistle pig I've ever tasted. can't wait, I'm making myself thirsty.   There menu is as eclectic as the floor staff. I've had the shrimp taco's which were exceptional, and the burger, which surpasses In & Out Burger, and just about any other burger I have ever had. Then there are the rabbit tamales, OMG, ok double OMG they are so good. This will become or is becoming my favorite spot."}
{"text":"If you eat at one place in Phoenix make it Second Story. The hardest decision you'll face is what to eat but worry not as everything is amazing. Rather than make the decision ourselves we opted to let our waitress decide for us. The carrot fondue is ingeniously delicious, the chicken is up there with the best I've ever had and the salads are all locally sourced, fresh and seasonal. My only regret was not leaving sufficient room for dessert but that's just a reason to come back"}
{"text":"Second Story Liquor Bar is awesome. They hit on all the important notes:  Food: outstanding. Fresh interesting ingredients cooked absolutely perfectly and with amazing flavor.  Try the Dandelion Gnocchi with anchovies....sounds weird but it is phenomenal.  These were by far the lightest, fluffiest pasta pouches I have ever eaten in my life.  Drinks: fantastic.  They specialize in bourbon drinks, and you once you taste one, you understand why.  I really enjoyed a cocktail called The Boulvardier (bourbon, campari and sweet vermouth with an orange twist...very refreshing).  Atmosphere: intimate. It's a very small space, so you feel extra special when you are able to get a table. Fantastic place to take a date.  I will definitely be coming back to cocktail and dine again!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best \"overall\" experience yet!! Starting with the welcoming attitude of each of the staff, followed by the best bar-top meal experience ever and the food was simply delicious!! There's nothing NOT to love. I'd be remiss if I didn't give special recognition to the Bar tender, whom I will keep anonymous, for privacy or until you get a chance to go there yourself.....but by far the most knowledgeable individual especially relating to Whiskeys and Bourbons and I appreciated the drink and meal recommendations!! Highly recommend this great restaurant and I will personally be going back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I wrestled with 4 and 5 stars, so please read the review and make your own decision.  First off, you need a reservation.  We tried to stop by once and were turned away.  In retrospect that was somewhat odd because on the Saturday night when we went it was only about 2/3rds full for the evening.  Food:  The food was exceptional, well executed and nothing over the top.  They made good use of ingredients and everything paired well and had a lot of subtle touches.  I wont go into the details of the food because I am sure the menu changes frequently and there is plenty of detail here already.  Drinks:  Rather extensive back bar that was rather wide but oddly not very deep.  I.e. great selection of bourbons and whiskeys, but didn't seem that adventuresome.  I had an exceptional Boulevardier and a flawless executed Sazerac but they were very traditional.  It's tough to say I am disappointed with the drink list, I am really not, because it is so hard to find the basics done so well, but ultimately I was yearning for another layer of creativity.  Staff:  Very well trained, could talk intelligently on both the food and drink menus.  Was succinct without being too verbose and obviously well educated on the menu.   *Understand this is coming from someone who owned a Gastropub and is hyper-aware of the tight rope of staff training.  Overall the level of service coupled with the quality of the food was exceptional.  It was also reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Came here for an event and was pleasantly surprised!  Very upscale, dark and moody upstairs and you'd never know.  Decorate with a huge chandelier, dark lighting and a great outdoor balcony; this would be a great location for an event.  Now, I was here for a daytime event so I have no idea if it turns douche at night. But the menu was great, delicious food, and my drinks were delish. Pricey, but it *was* an event.  Our wait staff was beyond friendly and attention."}
{"text":"We love it here! Amazing cocktails and ever better staff!! The #ginning is my favorite!! Great for a late night night cap or even to come in early and grab dinner. Michael always makes time to stop by and make sure we are enjoying our experience and we always are!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the French 75 & the fish special scallops were out of this world. Must try the WTF biscuits!"}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant. As you guessed it, it located in the upstairs portion of the building. Not very big but very cozy and cute. It's a bit fancier than I was expecting but we didn't feel too out of place for not knowing. Menu is nicely laid out, like upscale bar or gastro pub food. Whiskey menu is on point, cocktails are fairly priced for what's in them. I judge a whiskey type joint by how well the old fashion is which was just simple and true to firm. Nothing snazzy which is good. Service was really nice, deco is interesting. Would go again! I don't know if they have another way up besides the stairs but didn't look like it. Stairs are pretty narrow as well. Probably not a good place for kids."}
{"text":"Inspired and perfectly made cocktails!  Delightful atmosphere with an intimate & cozy bar.  We enjoyed the comfortable balcony seating.  Knowledgeable waitresses who could accurately breakdown the cocktails and advise on the various quality spirits.  Definitely will visit again when in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Drinks were great. Food was great. Service was excellent. Overall we had an awesome xperience! Really liked the relaxed speakeasy atmosphere and extremely knowledgeable staff. Our server, Aliza, really went above and beyond revisiting several times to share her passionate knowledge of whiskey and got us excited about tasting the Bourbon Flight. Favorite food item was the Burrata Caprese followed closely by the Potato Bites. Delicious. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The perfect ambience is definitely here for a quiet low-key adult night out on the town! The mixed drinks are definitely the star of the show here with very unique, simple flavorful and strong drinks that punch the point. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Exquisite cocktails, great atmosphere, good service, and fantastic food. Limited but delicious menu. Kale appetizer also makes for a great side salad. Desert is done as a single \"desert of the week.\" Ask about fish of the day. Also, great whisky list and whisky fights available."}
{"text":"This is a review for just the drinks. I did not get a chance to try any of the food.  And if you are a cocktail person, you must try this second story liquor bar! They provide your essentials like the Corpse Reviver, Sazerac, and Old Fashioned. The drinks are strong as they are supposed to be and the environment is pleasing to what you would expect for a place with these kinds of drinks. I will be back to try the food."}
{"text":"We had the most amazing meal here last night and can't wait to go back! We splurged and got the 4-course tasting menu and everything came out perfectly. I had the most amazing cod and am sad it's going to be taken off the menu soon as they change the menu every 6 to 8 weeks. Sometimes I find myself hungry after getting a tasting menu but last night was more than enough food.   The service was great as well as the atmosphere and the cocktails were top notch. I do agree with some other posts stating it's a three dollar sign restaurant and not a two but it was definitely worth it.   Happy to say I have a new favorite in town!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but was rather unimpressed.  It has such great reviews, however the staff was ok and the drinks were not that great.  I really enjoyed the fact that there were several bourbon/whiskey fights, however I would have liked to see more well rounded cocktail options.  Its a whiskey/bourbon bar so their cocktails feature mostly these liquors.  The decor was charming, however at the end of the day I don't think I will be visiting again.  Didn't leave with a favorite drink..."}
{"text":"This place is good. The food is good, the drinks are good and the service is good. The ambiance is cool, dark, and romantic with good vibes. However, I will say that the portions are small.... i mean really small! I get the whole tasting menu thing  but when you pay $100 for two 3 course tasting menus I expect not to leave HUNGRY. Everything was a couple bites. On a Saturday night wearing skin tight jeans and a crop top I don't anticipate stuffing myself but I left feeling like I had a starter and The Husband stopped at chick-fil-a on the way home. Dinner was $250 and for that I expect more. Sorry Y'all but don't know that we'll be back."}
{"text":"Came for restaurant week and was not disappointed. 4 in our party and we shared so we each tried everything except the veal and after we were finished our server told us just for restaurant week they were offering an additional course for $10. We were going to go with the chicken, which was awesome, but she came back around and told us they had run out of scallops for the evening and were offering sea bass with the same preparation in lieu...so we got that and were not disappointed.  I highly recommend this place and we are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Robert is amazing. So knowledgeable and makes drinking fun! Wish he and this bar was in my home town.  Just tell him what you like and he will make your dreams come true!"}
{"text":"Thank you to Tyler for turning our evening from good to great!  Stopped in for a drink. (Btw - if you want to eat here, GET A RESERVATION! Any more than a party of 2, and you will be waiting for everything.) Tyler helped me with my whiskey tasting, and thankfully recommended the cauliflower app, which was amazing!  Loved the atmosphere - string lights, good people watching from the upstairs wrap-around patio, and happy bartenders.   Will be back!"}
{"text":"What a magnificent establishment! After the demise of Old Town Whiskey at the hands of the Saguaro management, SSLB head alchemist John Christie has helped establish one of Scottsdale's most unique and engaging drink and food experiences. Based around a spectacular assortment of liquors (try all the bourbon, I have) the Second Story truly crafts a one of a kind experience with personal touch that is so infrequently found in Old Town. The food is an exciting treat and developing well as the chef gwts better and better! Come here and enjoy everything!"}
{"text":"Very good service and great place for happy hour.  Loved the squash blossom Brie fried."}
{"text":"A great place to relax and be taken care of.  The entire staff is well trained and do their jobs well.  Went in to see what this place was all about and have to say it was the best experience.  Detail was made in everything to make this a great experience from the ambiance to the details in the food.  The hostess Loren, wait staff Cara, manager and owner Tommy all greeted us at some point during the evening.  Cara was outstanding in presenting the menu and recommending foods to us. Definitely a place to return to.  The menu was interesting and the caesar salad and  salmon special were great.  Then on to the Gelato Spot for desert, just downstairs.  And that was equally as tasty.  We liked this place so much we came back the next night for pizza and more gelato downstairs."}
{"text":"I cant wait to get the opportunity to go back again!!! When we first arrived, the ladies instantly greeted us. The host then led us to our table. They were certainly dressed to impress! They where in white fitted lace dresses along with beautiful pearls. . Once inside our waitress was splendid. She had a fitted lace dress except it was black and she as well was wearing white pearls. She had a lace ruffle apron, that was super adorable!!! Loved it! She answered all our questions, explained the drinks and recommended us a few of them as well. Now, i cant remember what drink it was that i decided to get, but when she brought out our drinks...she brought them out on a silver platter!! :D  The menu doesn't have a large selection but that is not a negative. I decided to get the duck breast roulade. It was absolutely sensational. The duck was wrapped in  bacon, it also had golden raisins, sweet onions, parsnip puree, brussels sprouts, and orange gastrique. It was absolutely remarkable. I was so beautifully plated. i wish I had a picture buttt...i got to busy eating.. One thing I appreciated was that they were willing to work with my very long list of allergies. This was amazing to me. Towards the end of our dinner Chef Josh Bracher came out and talked to us for quit a bit about our lovely dinner and our experience.    Its the small little details that make this place exceptional. I couldn't have been happier. If you are looking to find a restaurant with good quality food, then you should really go to SSLB. Reading the reviews wont do justice. You will need to experience it yourself. Whether its on a date or even if you take yourself on a date, your experience will be completely worth it!! 5 STARS!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is very classy, the wait staff is top notch and the atmosphere is very cool and inviting."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends to celebrate a couple of birthdays after dinner just to get drinks. The check in process with the hostess station down stairs was very easy and she was very nice. There were 7 of us and we were sat upstairs in their outdoor section within 5 minutes. Walking upstairs the ambience is candlelight and subtle lighting throughout. Our waitress was very helpful and down to earth going over the drink list. They have a very nice drink selection with some pricier drinks but we'll worth the money being aged. I order a New England mule this was very good and came in a nice and very cold copper mug. Again, they have a very nice list of drinks of multiple selections available to fit everyone. Thank you again and we will be back."}
{"text":"Drinks galore!!   The drinks menu has so many choices I was on overload.  Whiskey to the left, Bourbon to the right, Scotch at the bottom (ahhhh the choices) I want them all.  Lol I have been wanting to come here for some time and so glad I finally did.  Great atmosphere, friendly staff and excellent drink choices for every one from the unique fruity/speciality cocktails to the people who take it neat!!   They have something for all. As someone who thoroughly enjoys a great Bourbon and Scotch they have it all.  I am so glad I finally found a bar that carries Stanahan's Colorado Wiskey. It's hard to find out here and is worth it once you do.    I was so entranced by the booze choice I'm pretty sure this place also has food ;) lol. Enjoy and can't wait to come back.    Oh and make a reservation. It's easier to get in."}
{"text":"Had a great evening.  We were a party of two and ate out on the balcony yet it was a little toasty at 8pm the mister system kept us cool so sit next to them if the temps outside are in the triple digits.   I had the short rib and my partner had the hanger steak.... Let's just say amazing.........  Drinks I had a ginger fizz and partner had the pineapple rum drink, then chased down with a double shot of titos and seven.... And we will leave it at that.  Our server was amazing as well she was spot on with the service tonight thanks Lori!    Thanks for a great night!"}
{"text":"I've frequented the Gelato Spot underneath and I finally went to check out Second Story last night. I had some friends in town for the first time and didn't know where to take them since they've already been to all the spots I like. I hoped I wouldn't disappoint them since I didn't know what to expect.  I arrived at 8pm and was suprised to find out there was a wait...thankfully it was only about a 5 minutes. After chatting with the hostess Gabby, who was super kind and sweet, I found out that they have a great late night menu (available 2 hrs before closing), everything is freshly made in house,  and I should probably make a reservation next time I come. The decor inside was classy, fun, dark and kind of a speakeasy feel. It looks bigger on the outside so I now realize why it's better to make a reservation. We all just had drinks which were good but nothing exciting. If you are a whiskey drinker you'd probably love what they have to offer since they have a huge whiskey menu. I do wish that they offered more \"girly\" drinks. Our waitress mentioned that they change the menu often. I'm not sure if she was referring to drinks, food or both.  Overall everyone enjoyed the experience at Second Sorry. I really liked the decor, vibe, service and would like to explore their food menu."}
{"text":"Wow.  What a find!  Don't like chains?  Like a one of a kind, boutique style, intimate environment, coupled with great atmosphere, food, cocktails and service?  Then, you need to go to the Second Story Liquor Bar, a new restaurant located on the Southwest corner of 3rd Ave. and Scottsdale Rd. in Old Town Scottsdale.  The name is derived from the fact that is in the same building as the super popular Gelato Spot on the second story!  From the moment you're greeted by one of the beautiful, gracious, classy hostesses, you'll get the feeling you're in the right place!  The menu is very unique and one would be hard-pressed to make a mistake in ordering.  A must have is the seared Caesar salad.  OMG!  A wedge of romaine lettuce is literally seared on a grill, then covered in this exquisite dressing, the likes of which I've never tasted.  I'm a big Caesar fan and this may be the best I've ever had!  I chose scallops for my entrée and, what can I say other than Mmm, Mmm, Mmm!!  You've got to sit at the bar sometime during your visit and ask for John (with the small ponytail) and have him create for you one of the signature cocktails or an old classic like a Mint Julep, Old Fashioned or Gin Fizz!  This guy is a bartender supreme!  Everyone there has obviously been very, very well trained.  The attention to detail is immediately obvious and the wait staff can't do enough to please you.  All this, thanks to the terrific and lovely general manager, Tracey, a Brit from across the pond who takes great pride in her work.  Even the waitresses uniforms are something to behold.  Absolutely beautiful lace creations accented by pearl necklaces.  I love this place and so will you!  Brian K."}
{"text":"Lovely little location in Old Town with a cool view of Scottsdale Rd. My husband and I came in at 6 pm on a Friday night, and we were lucky to get an outside table. He had a beer and I had the Pacific Rim. Unfortunately it was a little bitter for me, but that's my tastebuds. We had a few plates to share, including the kale salad, meatballs and WTF biscuits. We also share the ricotta gnocchi. My favorite were the salad and gnocchi. Our server was a bit green; I think this is her first time waitressing and she had a hard time describing items on the menu. She was also oddly absent. I was surprised with how long it took the food to come out, but we had a nice time chatting and enjoying the view in the meantime. Tommy the owner is a great guy, too."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere. Not very large, but very engaging. We started with the biscuits and jam. Moved on to the scallops, chicken and mushroom pasta , salad and of course red wine.  Really awesome dishes. The service is fantastic and you can tell the owner really cares, by the quality of everything.  This is a quality place."}
{"text":"I visited this bar a couple of weekends ago. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the drink menu is interesting. The selection for cocktails is interesting and my boyfriend was impressed at the selection of liquors they had. Our server was prompt and attentive, and the drinks came out quickly. The only downfall to my visit was the noise. It is a very small place and there was a group of 13 celebrating a birthday. It was really loud so I had a hard time talking to my boyfriend across the small table. There's really nothing you can do about that though! We ended up only staying for one drink but it was nice to try this place for the first time. We will be back."}
{"text":"One word: Outstanding. The service here at this bar is top notch. This restaurant/bar is cozy and upscale with an early 1900's theme. It is an absolute touch of class. I originally came in to have a few drinks after I left dinner. The general manager came over and personally greeted me. We began talking and she explained the owner's vision for this place, the concept behind the theme of the bar, and so on. She then introduced me to the bar manager. This guy was the most knowledgeable person on bourbons I've ever met.   I originally asked for a Basil Hayden bourbon (which is one of my favorite bourbons) however after talking to the bar manager and him listening to what my pallet is and what I typically like, he recommended I try something new and suggested a Cody bourbon. I was very impressed at how much I liked it. His knowledge of bourbons led me to this one and I have now added it to my list of bourbons favorites. This is an experience that you do not get at 98% of the bars that you go to. Absolutely priceless in my opinion. I highly recommend Second Story. It is unlike any bar that you will ever go to."}
{"text":"We checked into our hotel late 11:00 pm so wanted to grab a quick bite and have a cocktail somewhere.  We literary walked out of our hotel, crossed the street and happened upon this place.   Ambiance was dark but really decorated well. Since bar was closing in an hour we had to order off the happy hour/late night menu. We ordered cocktails and the Cheesesteak.  This was so tasty and I think the loaf of bread was like a sweetbread.  Veggies were grilled and the flavor was like no other Cheesesteak I've tried.    I think looking at dinner menu and reviews I would definitely come back.   Strong Yay in recommending second story."}
{"text":"Perfectly prepared belly with an excellent bourbon (rye actually)."}
{"text":"This place was such a pleasant surprise! The food and service were both great with an interesting ambiance. The only negative we all agreed on is the staircase. Too dark!! After a few drinks this could be a challenge for some.   We all (4) agreed this place is super good."}
{"text":"Very memorable and unique experience. Upscale and different from the your typical bars with a speakeasy vibe and beautiful art/trinkets surrounding the dining area. The waitresses don chic maid lacy maid outfits done classy not halloween-esque at all, and the men are suited up to the t. Very cool vibe and i felt like a movie star being in here.  Drinks and food are 5 star quality and too pretty to eat but we demolished them anyways. GET THE PIMMS CUP! Delicious cocktail with bright and fresh herbal tones it went down so smooth. From beginning to end the service was impeccable and all of our food arrived in perfect unison. Park behind the gelato shop and walk around for FREE PARKING.  The cherry on top was the way they completely accommodated me with their own vegan creation because there wasn't one already available on the menu. It was very good, but with a top chef in the kitchen it wasn't too much of a surprise. The only con was feeling like the majority of things were overpriced. Definitely would come again for a special occasion but this is not a place you can come daily unless you got money to burn. Perfection!"}
{"text":"This was more than dinner -- it was an extraordinary experience!  We each had the 3 course tasting to maximize opportunities to try the menu items.  Every single bite was a perfect explosion of flavors.  I am not prone to hyperbole and not typically inclined to write reviews.  This exceptional meal breaks all my rules. The service was impeccable,; the cocktails were great;  and the Owner a friendly presence who lent a helping to staff when needed.  The smoked yams were a surprising delight. Make this your next reservation."}
{"text":"I love everything about Second Story, it's not a huge spot but the energy is always fabulous, it's interior is intimate but still great for groups and the patio is killer. Their menu has something for everyone and never disappoints. The whiskey selection is awesome but if whiskey isn't your thing they have a great cocktail menu. There is usually a hostess to greet you at street level and escort you upstairs for drinks, bites and/or dinner. It's really a unique experience for Old Town."}
{"text":"A win for liquid refreshment... But be wary of the portion sizes.  Second story is a restaurant really hitting its stride in some ways and slipping in others. The atmosphere is really cool (dark, hip with a bi of swank in the mix), the drink menus is refreshing and innovative (broken up into different eras for a time machine of booze!), and the drinks are made with care.   At this point most people are unplugging their phones to head there way but hold on.  The complaints I have deal with the food. At first the restaurant had great portion sizes and delicious food. Then one of those fell off and it's the portion size. After three recent visits I've come to realize the food is way over priced for what you get. (I even asked the waitress about the change and she did not appreciate the observation). In fact the wait staff is friendly but a bit quick with you. As though saying \"you need to be quite to understand the depth of our restaurant.\"   Probably too deep into that last point but I don't need someone to explain away why I spending 20 plus dollars for a rather modest size meal when there are so many wonderful restaurants in this area.   Conclusion: great place to start the night for a drink. Stay away from the food since you will end up resenting what was ordered for not satiating Your hunger.   To try: phil fish punch cocktail, pins cup cocktail."}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly service.  The food was excellent.  The drinks were also delicious.  This is a great date spot. It is fun to sit on the patio.  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I hate to even give this place one star but just being honest. The drinks were wayyyyy over priced even for Scottsdale! The food tastes like cardboard and cost too much. Definitely not recommending this place!"}
{"text":"Hit this spot up last night with some friends before heading to a dance bar. We had a great time and sat inside for a bit then got a table outside. They had misters going so it was comfortable. Very classy spot with a cool city vibe. The crowd vibe was classy and hip, but not in a snooty way. We really enjoyed it here. Seems like a great place to eat also, but we didn't eat we just had drinks. Definitely worth a repeat."}
{"text":"Great cocktails and cool ambiance. I need to come back and check out the patio.   I can't comment on the food but the manager there was awesome, going so far as to chase us down the street when I forgot something on the table. Thanks again manager guy."}
{"text":"Great selection of whiskey,bourbon and scotch coupled with some good food a can't miss place to go to!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in old town. I'm still confused which nights they're open - but if they are their food is so worth it! Good drinks. Great ambience. And kinda of an exclusive speakeasy feel here."}
{"text":"The food for restaurant week was excellent. The cocktails were excellent (anytime u can get a vesper martini done correctly I am a happy camper) and the service was the shining star, from our server to the gm to the owner it was WIN/WIN all around.   Worth a trip"}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a girls' night out or a relaxed night of cocktails. They often have a wait on the weekend, the speakeasy vibe is fun and the whiskey is strong."}
{"text":"Great unique atmosphere. Love the whisky flights. Food items are small portions but very tasty. Would definitely return"}
{"text":"Have been here several times over the past couple months.  Great atmosphere and furniture although it would be nice if the bar area was a little larger.  All of the drinks and cocktails are very good - recommend the Old Fashioned and Gin Fizz.  The brussels sprouts and mushroom flatbread are tasty shareable items for small groups."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, just what scottsdale needed. A bar with class and all the talent to match it. Simply the best dining experience I have had in a long time. Highly recommend it for any event and to finish it off the GM is English! so nice to see a fellow lady from the mother land. I would recommend booking, word is out about this place and very popular."}
{"text":"Great night at Second Story. This place is a gem. Started out ordering everything on the starter menu & and it all tasted fantastic. Ask Tommy the owner how he got biscuits on the menu if you dare. The place has loads of personality from the owner through every staff member to the Paul Harvey recordings in the restroom. Great location in old town, Gerard there for some awesome food & drinks!"}
{"text":"The friends we were with loved it when I described this charming, sexy place as an \"orgy of cocktails\".  The food is likewise terrific.  With a daring, exciting, and an ever changing menu, this place is exactly what Scottsdale and Phoenix need more of;  nicely done!"}
{"text":"It was a great experience from the beginning to the end. I was especially wowed by the level of service and how enthusiastic and genuine the entire staff was: hostess taking us up, our waitress arranging different plating for all of us - to be able to share, owner stopping by to check on us and even a peak into kitchen revealing two chefs finishing our desert - everybody was on the same vibe of people enjoying their jobs - LOVELY! ...and did I mentioned that all the food was excellent and really special?! Not what would you necessary assume when entering a \"liquor bar\". Loved it and would happily suggest this hidden pearl to anybody :)"}
{"text":"Unbelievable experience. Hard to describe the imaginative and attentive service, food and cocktails we enjoyed. See cheese plate photo. Not even on the menu. Totally custom from Tommy the owner and Robert the bartender. Most amazing gin cocktail ever. Wouldn't come to Scottsdale and miss this gem."}
{"text":"We went here for my friends birthday dinner. She is extremely picky, so choosing a restaurant for her elevated taste was concerning. Luckily i relied on Yelp and found this gem.  The food is FANTASTIC. I tried a bit off of everyone's plate. And the drinks were fun and unique. I would comment on what we ordered but.. the menu changes every 3 months. So  go in for yourself and try, best idea if you are not on a budget is to sample from their menu. They have a course meal deal ($60 i believe) and you can try different parts of their menu.  Such a great experience!"}
{"text":"Would definitely go back for the ambiance and to try other drinks but only an above average old fashioned."}
{"text":"Had a reservation got there a bit early to have a drink.  Were treated like trash for not knowing they had a small bar and couldn't accommodate us.  Left and found a great place down the street.  They need to teach there hostess' how to treat people."}
{"text":"This is a review for a dining experience I had a couple months ago, so I'm not sure if they are still serving these dishes.   My girlfriends and I came here for a birthday and we experienced AMAZING service. I ordered the conquistador (a little strong for my weak taste buds but still good) and my girl friends all ordered the \"every rose has its thorn\" drink, which I later switched to.   Everything we ordered was delicious and if my memory serves me correctly, we had a really great lobster mushroom/veggie started plate.   Both dinner and drinks were 5/5. What really put this experience over the top for me was that (one of) the owner(s) sat down with us, granted he knew the birthday girl. But he sat and chatted with us and dined with us- such a sweet heart. Even better, we had the opportunity to meet the chef who was the mastermind behind all of the dishes, he spoke to how he hand selects all the ingredients and picks everything as locally as possible. You could really tell he cared about what ended up on the plate in front of you."}
{"text":"Love love love love this place. Amazing drinks. Pimms Cup was the bomb. Can't wait to go back for dinner. We had the butter cake and it was honestly the best dessert I've ever had. Everyone there was so happy. Amazing place. Tommy the owner makes you feel like you are family. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Best biscuits ever!!!  They were so good I had to order it twice (once as the app and then again as my dessert).  It is something I will not only remember but will talk about afterwards too.  Yes, that good.  I also liked my dinner of pork belly lettuce wraps and my husband enjoyed his gnocchi dish too.  I only had one bite of his gnocchi but it was melt in your mouth airy goodness.  Plus the cocktails were on point.  I liked that they offered a good number of single malt scotch too!  This place is pretty hip with a cool atmosphere and really great service.  Even though there was only one waitress scheduled for the Monday night we were there, she really did an incredible job.  I would definitely recommend this place to friends and come back to dine here whenever I am in the area."}
{"text":"Unique place. The bar specializes in whiskey, and the old fashioneds were just perfect. Had the mushroom flat bread, which i highly recommend. Service was excellent with great attention to detail. It is a much more laid back, grown up scene than the average Scottsdale bar.  Happy hour starts at ten on Saturday night, so we were too early for the wings. I guess we will have to go back."}
{"text":"This place is perfect if you're looking for classy drinks in an intimate environment. It isn't packed like many of the other liquor bars in old town Scottsdale and has a great view. Our server was extraordinarily nice and helpful. All the staff are dressed to the nines and very personable. They have the best mint julep you will ever have! Truly a gem!"}
{"text":"Drinks a great if you like the overpriced kind with too much ice and not enough drink. Food is way overpriced, tiny portions yet not horrible tasting. I only go here bec some of the girls I work with like the Mules and I'm a fan of their dark beer, which they rarely have any of by the time I get off at 9:30pm. This place is a hit or miss but if you like to dress to the 9 on a Tuesday night and be apart of the \"in crowd\" of Scottsdale I would say this is your place."}
{"text":"Meh....the servers had some major attitude here. The food was good but we just tried it for happy hour.   The food was super tiny. I'd say pass on it personally."}
{"text":"After reading all the glowing reviews about this place, we decided to check it out. Wow, we were very impressed. The friends we took with us can be a little \"persnickety\" about restaurants, so I hoped they would also like it. They raved about it!!  Our drinks were fabulous, trying a few off of the menu, then when they were so good, I had the bartender make a \"bartenders choice\" drink for me. Wonderful. I drank a little more than I should have, but well worth the headache this morning!!   Then, the food, again, pleasantly surprised with each thing we ordered. If you are not a fan of spicy - then just ask about that with each item. A couple of things were a bit too spicy for me - but I'm a spice wimp. Everyone else thought it was fine. We all had bites of each others food. YUM!!!!!!  We will go back for the drinks and the food!!!"}
{"text":"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly  The Good:  Service.  Chef and Manager came to table to apologize (see The Bad).  Dessert was \"comped\".    The Bad:  Took about 30 minutes for a small appetizer plate with not much on it (dollop of this, smear of that, 4 tiny pickles, slice of salami cut into 6 or 8 little triangles) to come to the table.  Main courses did not all come out together.  One plate was forgotten altogether (see The Good). Gnocchi bowl was tiny and tasted burnt.    The Ugly:  Seemed a tad over-priced for what we got.  $6 ice ball in a drink which was not divulged until after questioning the bill.  The option for regular ice cubes was not even provided.  It's the typical Old Town Scottsdale restaurant trying hard to be classy and provide a unique gastronomic experience but not quite hitting the mark.  Maybe, given time?  I think I'll stick to Phoenix (downtown, midtown and uptown)."}
{"text":"I finally made it to this place with a group of friends. I was quite impressed! Space had a good vibe with great service. Not sure why it took me so long to try this place but I would recommend to anyone looking for a great cocktail in lounge type space. This is the place to try specialty cocktails. I'm looking forward to going again soon and have told my friends."}
{"text":"I had been anticipating to eat here since before SSLB opened and what better time to try it than restaurant week! They had a different menu for the week rather than the current one for the month. I did all three courses plus the drink pairings.   For the first course I had the Crispy Sweet Breads with frisée sundried tomatoes, smoked pickles green onions, balsamic fig glaze and dandelion mouse and a New England Mule to accompany it. The dandelion muse was so interesting! It was probably my favorite part of the dish aside from the sweet bread, of course. Everything was so light and it all blended so well. I'm a huge mule fan and the New England mule was nothing short of delicious.   For the second course I had the Spinach Ricotta Gnudi with rapini pesto, brûléed cherry tomatoes, golden raisins, pine nuts, balsamic glaze and seasonal wild mushroom. I'm gonna go ahead and say that I am a huge mushroom hater but on this night I set aside our differences and actually ENJOYED them greatly in this dish. And oh my god, can we talk about the brûléed cherry tomatoes?! I want a lifetime supply of these!! This dish was paired with a Hemingway Daiquiri which I thought was super appropriate. Hemingway said these drinks \"had no taste of alcohol and felt, as you drank them, the way downhill glacier skiing feels running through powder snow.\" And yeah, I couldn't agree more. He would've been proud of both the dish and his namesake drink.   For my third and final course I had the Veal Chop with melted fennel bulb, tomato mustard relish, confit tomato and creme fraiche bound farro. Okay so I'm going to rant and rave about how absolutely PERFECT the veal was. It was seriously cooked so perfectly! I could have ordered seconds or thirds. Probably even fourths. Actually I would have made all three of my courses this dish. I could have wiped that kitchen out of this dish if allowed to. It was absolutely AMAZING. And the mint julep that was paired with this was so refreshing on that warm Arizona night.   My dining experience at SSLB was nothing short of amazing. I will definitely be going back to check out and try the regular menu."}
{"text":"Because of it's name, i've only come here for liquor. I have been here several times, but I have never eaten here, maybe if it was called meat bar, then odds are I would have. But i digress.    First of all the \"bar\" itself is tiny, theres like maybe 5 desirable seats at the bar. So getting a seat at the bar is not a convenient process. It starts with standing outside on the sidewalk & attempting to get the attention of the hostesses that give you attitude as if you're interrupting them from their latest snapchat & instagram updates.   Have faith though, you will eventually be sat. In contrast, the bartenders themselves usually give great service & make pretty good drinks. Are they amazing drinks, no, but still very good. The prices are a tad high, but that's kind of expected since you're probably paying for their prime location.   Overall, this place is just ok. This place is right on par with the other decent cocktail bars in the Scottsdale area. You can defintely do much worse, at the very least you'll get a decently made cocktail here."}
{"text":"We discovered this place tonight and we are now going to call it 'home.'  The ambience was great, loved the food and cannot say enough about John who shared some of the best Kentucky bourbon I have ever had. Please ask for Aliza - she took such great care of us. She was wonderful and we trusted her with recommendations - she didn't disappoint us the whole evening. We will be coming here often...."}
{"text":"It was my wife's birthday and we had a party of eleven. I called ahead of time and spoke to Michael, the manager, regarding reserving a table (or two) on a Saturday night. This was my first time here so I was kind of nervous about the food and service especially with a bigger group of people. Bottom line - everything from the food, drinks, service and ambiance was on point!! We pretty much had everything on the menu from apps to entrees; everything was just simply amazing!! Overall we all had an amazing experience and will back very soon!!! Oh and thanks Michael for making sure we and a great experience!"}
{"text":"This place was very cool.  The waitresses were very nice and unformed were dressed scanty clad.  The night we went for a birthday they had very few liquor or mixers of the options we wanted (sad) and even limited quantities of each item on the menu.   The food was delicious but the fact they out a \"foam\" \"reduction\" on everything was cool on first plate but not on every single plate.   The bartender was also very Nice but sad that drink options were limited due to lack of Inge Tory."}
{"text":"Awesome option if you want your cow to be slaughtered when you sit down & wait a day & a half"}
{"text":"Never made it inside. We wanted a refreshment after walking around Scottsdale gallery hopping. This place looked cool- a little swank. We knew the cubs game had started so when we stopped, we asked if the cubs game was on. Now we probably would have gone in regardless BUT the male-bait hostesses told us \"um we don't have a TV upstairs but maybe you can go to Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers\" the sloppy sorta bar down the street. So that's a shame. Maybe I should have worn something nicer but I had a collar and my nice sandals.  Ended up at Farm Craft for delicious cocktails and - the cubs game."}
{"text":"Perfect date spot, went with the hubs and we really enjoyed every part of our meal. The drinks were amazing so was all the food and dessert. Very classy spot."}
{"text":"On Monday June 27th we took our friend here.  It was his birthday and his wife was out of town.  This was our second visit here.  The first was in January and it was a good but not great experience.  THIS visit was GREAT.. the server ( Lori ) was extremely knowledgable and friendly.  We had asked for Tommy ( the owner )as our last visit review was acknowledged by him personally, and he requested that we asked for him.  He wasn't there yet but stopped by our table when he arrived.  The food was wonderful and service so much better this time.  He bought our table a glass of champagne and birthday dessert of course!  The food is unique and tasty.  The room is elegant.  We want to go on Jazz night ( Thursdays ) to hear the band.  This place is quite the find.  A secret hideaway you must find!!"}
{"text":"We celebrated our 17th anniversary here. It was WONDERFUL. We both agreed it was an awesome experience. The hostess is at the street level but you get to walk through a mini wine cellar looking area up a flight of stairs to the restaurant, which is on the second story. Aptly named. We were seated in a booth in a quiet corner of the restaurant; very intimate setting. We had our little nook to look out from, and felt nestled in and comfortable.   The decor is fabulous - it seems like they are going for a sassy contemporary vintage; chandelier, dark material on booths, large paintings, lanterns at the table. Feels like an old school lounge on one hand. But then there are contemporary surprises and that's the genius of this place - it doesn't feel dated, it feels reimagined. The music was a perfect compliment to the decor; songs like \"it ain't got that swing\" remixed with a more contemporary beat. Loved it.   My husband got a whiskey flight. It was pricy, there's no way around it. $40 but it was so worth it. The cheapest whiskey flight it $25. He's been wanting to try a whiskey flight and he had the Japanese one. Loved it. I, on the other hand, had a glass of a brut rose which was lovely. I am a sucker for sparkles.   There's nothing straight up vegan on the menu but this is exactly what I love about going to a restaurant with a talented chef. The waitress said he could whip me up something and he sure did. By far the best vegan dish I've had out in a long time. It was spaghetti squash with veggies and marinara. I've NEVER liked spaghetti squash like this before. There was also asparagus, onions, zucchini, tomato - it was wonderful. Truly. The sauce had a flavor that I can't identify and was out of the world. The chef also thought about texture and threw some pepitas on for some crunch. Ya, I'm waaaaaaaaay happy and ate the entire thing.  Being my complete opposite, my husband got the burger that had three different meats, a house pickle, and cheese with French fries. He said it was the top #1 or #2 burger he's had in his entire life. That's no small compliment.   We will be back. Not your everyday dinner unless you've got the spare cash, but absolutely worth a visit for something special.   We both want to come again sometime!"}
{"text":"Tried to get in for a bite to eat this evening but they were on a 45 minute wait..  That's pretty impressive considering it is only Tuesday.  Well I just went home and turned on Fargo and decided I would just order delivery from somewhere.  I went with UberEATS tonight and to my very happy surprise I noticed I could order food from Second Story Liquor Bar.  I ordered and received my food in less than 30 minutes.  Everything was prefect and I highly recommend ordering delivery from there when you are too lazy to go out but also too picky to eat crappy food lol"}
{"text":"Great ambiance but it's pretty much all hype. The prices are outrageous given the portion sizes. I was really disappointed when our check arrived, nearly $80 for two appetizers and 3 drinks. The waitress popped us for $6 for water. Ok, it was \"sparkling\" and we got lime wedges. I believe that the upsell price should have been mentioned at the time it was offered. Also, they DO NOT honor their Yelp check in offer for $6 well drinks. My well drink didn't qualify because I asked for it to be on ice and that means it comes with more alcohol so they charged full price and refused to make the adjustment when I paid. Their $12 cocktails aren't very complex either. We won't repeat. Swing and a miss. Oh, and poutine is on pasta?  Chowder with no broth? Strange."}
{"text":"Came here Saturday night with a girlfriend for drinks. We had two waitresses (assuming one was training) and they were both friendly and knowledgable. I will say however, service was SLOW. At one point we ordered a drink that took 20 minutes to get. My friend loved her wine so much she wanted to take a picture of the bottle. The waitress said she would bring it out and never did. Cocktails were expensive. The view on the patio outside is great."}
{"text":"If I could give it a 0 I would. We had a RESERVATION and the hostess sat us and made us wait for 30 MINUTES!!! Then continued to seat people who just walked with no reservation. Food is terrible and it's noisy. DO NOT COME HERE!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden jewel. The atmosphere is very dark and kinda like a Jazz bar type feel. I was beyond impressed with the flights and drink selections. The only reason I'm Not giving it 5 stars because the service we had was eh... Not horrible but not fantastic. She seemed knowledgeable on some stuff but on other stuff like our order or which flight was which..... Not so much. I do wish they would change the music up, we went last time on a Friday night but the music was very tranquil like a spa? It just didn't make sense. I love the concept and the detail of the bar and I look forward to trying them again and actually ordering food next time because the food smelled amazing!  It would be a great place to take a date, or co workers or impress an out of town visitor. I don't believe it's kid friendly nor handicap friendly as you do walk up a flight of stairs. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"after being seated we waited for at least 10 minutes for water, typically wouldn't be a huge deal but we had asked to be seated on the patio and it was rather warm out even though it was the evening.  I ordered the lobster corn dog as a starter for the table and the 6 oz filet. The filet was good. The server compared their filet to Mastro's, not even comparable!!  The lobster corn dog never made it to the table. When i asked about the starter she said she could bring it, but at that point we had already waited 30+ min for our food.  Overall the food and cocktails we had were good, but not great and not worth returning for."}
{"text":"I first visited second story several years ago for happy hour with a friend and was very impressed with their food (mainly their homemade bread mmmm) and drinks. So when I was looking for a place to go with a group of 4 for restaurant week, it seemed like a good excuse to give this place another shot. Unfortunately, the experience was not so hot. It wasn't the food....well....most of it anyway. It was mainly the service.   We were seated on the patio, which was nice. Our waitress ran through the menu. We ordered our 3 course restaurant week meal and added a couple orders of biscuits with their special butter and bacon jam at the waitress's suggestion. We received the biscuits....which were very tasty....but not butter or jam. No one came around for awhile, so we ate the biscuits as is. When the waitress came back, we mentioned we never got the butter or jam so she brought some out, but at that point we only had maybe half a biscuit left. The jam was awesome! Just wish we had had it with the food.   So then the apps come out.....their fine...no problem. When it's time for the entrees, the waitress came by and took all our silverware. Then two meals were dropped off....but no silverware. Then many minutes go by. The other two meals don't come. The silverware doesn't come. No one comes outside. Then desserts start to be delivered..... We had to tell them that they only ever brought two of the 4 entrees and never brought utensils to eat with. I get mistakes happen, but the kicker was they prepared the other two entrees and brought them out but didn't replace the original two....so their food was ice cold. Not a good showing. I had the short ribs and, while I liked them, the other two people who got them did not (maybe because theirs was cold).   So then it's time for the actual dessert. This may have been the most disappointing part of the meal. They billed one dessert as a Nutella budino, which at every restaurant I've ever had it at (which is many), is a firm pudding in a cup or jar . What I was served was a Nutella soup with pretzels and bananas floating in it. The pudding didn't set. I don't know if that was intentional or not, but it was not very good. The other dessert was a plum upside down cake of sorts....it was sad and dry....no one ate their dessert.    So at the end of the meal the waitress knew we hadn't had a great experience and said she was sending over the manager. We waited another 10-15 minutes. The manager never showed. The waitress came back and offered us 15$ off cards for a future visit..... A little weird given a future visit is probably not going to happen. I guess the manager was too busy to come talk with us.  Additionally, when we received our check, we were charged for the bacon jam and butter that we didn't get until after the biscuits were eaten (they took it off when asked).   Bottom line: the bread here is awesome, the food here is good (but not as good as it is expensive), the dessert here is not so good, and the service, at least on our visit, was appalling. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here tonight w another couple for the very first time. All I can say is the food was good but not that good for the price. Very cute interior n the staff service was impeccable but the food didn't blow me out of the water for the price. We started w the cauliflower appetizer. Good. Very similar to other restaurants. I got the octopus entree, my husband got the chicken n mushroom pasta, my gf got the house special: lamb pasta n her husband got the short rib burger. I had a bite of everything n it was good except my husband's chicken mushroom pasta was super salty. I don't even kno how he ate it. He did say it was super salty but he was so hungry he ate it all. My octopus was absolutely delicious. Perfectly crunchy n crispy but so delicious on the inside. Short rib burger was good but hard to screw that one up. My gfs house special pasta was the best!!!   The interior was so cute n cozy. Would definitely come back for drinks but not so much for food. But don't get me wrong . Food was good. But it's more of a drink place."}
{"text":"If you love whiskey this is the spot to go to.  Reminds me of a smaller version of seven grand in Los Angeles.   Took my gf here last night because she's a big whiskey lover.   The vibe here feels like a gentlemens bar but the atmosphere makes everyone feel comfortable.   The drink list is good, and the flights are set up perfect for which ever type of whiskey or scotch you desire.   The staff was nice and our water was always filled and we were constantly checked up on which was nice.   The old fashion is good and since it's been awhile since I had one I forgot how strong they were lol.   Iam coming back to this place and I'm going to get the poppy flight."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere with excellent cocktails. Has a speak easy feel to it. Bartender takes great pride in his concoctions."}
{"text":"Dined here a couple weeks after it opened. I loved this place. It's small, with a great atmosphere.....the patio view outside is a nice addition. The service was great and the food was delicious. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yum!!! If you are looking for food that's almost if not 1 Michelin star quality, then I highly recommend trying this place out.   I ordered the ahi tuna wrapped in potato and my boyfriend ordered a sea bass dish. We also added an order of chicken wings at happy hour price. My tuna was delicious!! It was very fresh and I especially enjoyed the gnocchi and sauces that came on the dish. Another huge plus was that the dishes all came very well plated. It definitely takes the experience another level up.  Since their menu changes regularly, I'm going to spare going into more detail about the food. Tdlr is that it was really good and worth the price. The only bad thing for me is that they don't have dessert. :( I love dessert so that was definitely saddening...but if you're looking for good drinks and food, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere with exceptional service. Started at the bar and had a great cocktail from Wendell. Then moved over to a table and had excellent service from Jody. Limited menu because I was there late at night but every item was done really well. The biscuits are to die for. The Sazerac drinks are done proper and in a classic fashion."}
{"text":"We tried this place for restaurant week. I had my eye on this place for a while and it happened to show up on the list of restaurants. Definitely worth it!   First off the environment/ambiance of the place is hottt! Waitresses are all beautiful and the dim lighting along with the relaxed lounging sitting makes for a very intimate /romantic experience. The customer service is great and I hand get even gotten to the food! So not only is the place/environment amazing...the food and drinks are awesome!  So let's get to the food and drinks right? That's why you guys are reading this . First off their menu had creative titles so that was an impressive start! Well our choice of drinks tonight were the bright and sunny & the coconut and chill. The drinks are described in detail in the pictures I provided. I will admit the drinks are pricey but where are they not with higher quality liquor and a boujee place to drink. They were 14 a piece! Ouch! So I was hoping they had a bite to them and weren't highly diluted with froufrou stuff! The drinks didn't disappoint ! Flavorful but with a bite!   Next we tried the wtf biscuits with fermented honey! Totally worth it!! Outside biscuit just a touch of crisp flakiness with the inside being soft and warm to the taste with a touch of honey not overpowering it! Mmmmmm!   Next was the appetizers! I got the goat cheese ancini with pea and carrot purée. Absolutely delicious . Goat cheese is a hit or miss with me. Sometimes tastes too strong and goat like lol. This one was perfect and delicious! My boyfriend got the baby gem with green goodness dressing. Mehhh...it was the only thing the whole night that was not impressive. Typical salad. So I don't recommend that.    Next the entree!! We both chose the coconut caramel short ribs with bok choy with 5 spices. YUM! Small proportion I will admit but was still delicious. I'm not a big fan on the spice anise so that would throw me off at times. My boyfriend enjoyed it all!   Finally the dessert!! Had with plum upside down cake with cream friache and orange zest. Delicious pleasurable treat! I already know I like upside down pineapple cake and this creative spin on it did not disappoint! Every bite delicious!   The experience was worth it! Pricey, yes! But the environment, food, customer service amazing and worth it for a treat here and there! So now go try it! Especially if you get a chance during restaurant week!"}
{"text":"Go to place when we have out of town friends come in and want something different. We've been there a few times, I highly recommend you call for reservations.   They change their menu based on the season, carrot fondue was a really surprising dish that I can't stop raving about. The shishito pepper app is fun but pretty simple, fun because it's like roulette if one them might be spicy.     Drinks are all well crafted, the waitresses know the menu so ask questions to get the right fit for you. Some drinks are stronger tasting than others.   On one occasion we called ahead, were seated, then moved (they asked us if we would) and then forgotten about. We left after 20 minutes when we still didn't have water. I've been back since and never had that happen again so I think it was a one off. Inside can get loud so we always opt for outside seating."}
{"text":"Food selection was good.  Atmosphere was good. Service was great.  A bit pricy on the drinks, but that was expected.  I had the chicken pasta and it was tasty.  Might be a bit spoiled coming from Chicago, so I wasn't wowed by this place and this the 4 stars.  Probably one of the better places in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Love love the ambiance here!  The food is fresh and tasty, definitely would come back here."}
{"text":"Excellent fun upscale Mixology Bar. Fun eclectic crowd with a good vibe excellent cocktails with a fun friendly staff that is here to guide you to get the best cocktails that you are craving. Also has some interesting food that they serve till 1am. Definitely come by and check it out. They are obviously on the second story so you can overlook Scottsdale Road and Indian School. Call Fun Spot to check out. On the smaller side but Keepsake quaint nice and the noise level down. Definitely come by and check it out."}
{"text":"Still rated a 0 not even 1 star because You're an idiot! There are way to many competitors and bars in walking distance of your establishment to be dealing with a business that doesn't appreciate ALL its customers.   Let's not forget the fact that I could have went anywhere that night but i choice your restaurant/bar.   Wait you didn't even address the real issue and that's bring me check and running my card on a bill that i never saw beforehand moreover no authorizing. In other words, presenting us with one check and returning with a completing different one. You ran my card based on a charge that I didn't approve -- so who's the scammer?   I'm banned, well, that was a surprise since those words never came out of your mouth but guess what?  What person in there right mind who spend there money to be treated the way we were treated so guess what you don't have to worry about me or us returning and I will tell everyone about my BAD experience; and I mean everyone.   If you want to continue being a top rated business you will have so show some respect, even when things go bad, that's real customer service and that pure (I think you me plain) and simple.   All the reviews posted before mine with a poor score you got the never to respond disrespectfully."}
{"text":"Intimate but loud. So in the end is not so intimate cause you barely hear what the other person is saying... Oh but you did that on purpose! ;-) waitresses go around tables with very short skirts and obviously they're all pretty. Don't bring your male date here cause inevitably he will be too caught up staring at them. Not that it's a crime to be pretty, but in my opinion attire decency of the staff also tells a lot about the establishment.   The menu looks very appealing but is limited. Only few items on one small page. We didn't try the food this time, perhaps we will on another occasion. Also the wines by the glass are insufficient. Put a bit more options!   It was a \"meh\" experience and I won't crave to go back."}
{"text":"Average Scottsdale fare. Way overpriced for what it purports to be. Waiting at the door is weird. It was food."}
{"text":"Update: Not sure name calling really addresses the fundamental problems listed in the review...or for that matter the basic concept of customer service in the adult world...but then the petulant reaction comes as no real surprise."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place! John is an artist with drinks. An amazing jewel to find in down town Scottsdale. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Expect greatness when you walk through the door.  They go out of their way to distinguish themselves as something extraordinary, and they succeed.  From the servers' elegant outfits to the carefully selected decor to the classic chairs and benches, 2nd Story LB is out of the movies we watch and wish we were in.    I took my mom and brother here for a special occasion and that it was.  The food was memorable, succulent, and served in perfect unison with the menu description.  The drink menu was typical for a place aiming at mixology drinks but nonetheless excelled in taste.  I ordered a Diablo something and beyond the taste even the glass was classy.    Our server Brittany was unstoppably attentive, humorous, and A+ all around.    They need to work on dimming the lighting a bit but otherwise the mood is perfect for a date spot.  Last thing I'll say is it twas a shame that some putzes showed up wearing shorts and t-shirts looking like casual tourists. Though they were perfectly accepted by the staff, this place is a classy joint...so if you go then at least have fun and dress up a bit more than being in your family room on Sunday watching the football game and enjoy the cool elegance of something wonderful.  Looking forward to seeing this place thrive."}
{"text":"Seriously such a wonderful place! Great people! Great atmosphere! Great food!!! And phenomenal drinks! My boyfriend and I absolutely loved this place and will definitely be telling everyone about it! Check it out if you get a chance!"}
{"text":"If you like large portion American food dont go here ..go to Bucca Di Pepo (LOL) However if you love your food exquisitely prepared and layered in flavors. This is great place. I love the atmosphere and real craft drinks and not a glass full of ice and a one shot and wash, sloshed in by some Scottsdale Douchtender. These are craft drinks made by skilled people. It isnt a place to go knock back 6 Bud Lights and  1/2lb burger. (cold beers and cheesburgers is for that) The story linbe works well and the ambience is a classic throw back to places that are hard to find anymore."}
{"text":"A very cool/unique establishment with good service - but expect very loud music and expect pricey drinks. Not really for anyone over 45 years old. This is too trendy for people who want to go out and actually talk to each other. Also, if you don't mind spending $15 for a drink that doesn't even give you a buzz, well, it's for you. More trendy than classy."}
{"text":"Excellent Moscow Mules served in copper mugs. How many did I have? I can't remember.  What I do remember is that the food was a letdown. It was as though the chef was trying too hard to be cool. Foam on everything? I thought we're over foam already.  Anyway, we both got the tasting menu for $54pp and I ordered Hamachi Crudo, Roasted Beets, and Chilean Sea Bass. The crudo and beets were solid but nothing special. The problem was the sea bass; it was overcooked. And yes, the portions were tiny.  I expected more innovative food and perhaps my expectations were too high."}
{"text":"Fabulous. My Corpse Reviver gin drink was tasty and the food was amazing, as well. Great atmosphere and good times with our large party. Thanks to Tommy for a great time-visit the bathroom, trust me ;-)"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place entirely by accident. A group of work friends and I were strolling down the road, trying to find a place to get our dance on after a really dismal dinner and margarita experience at Salty Señorita. The hostess who sits on at the booth on the street right outside of the Gelato Spot entrance asked us if we wanted to come upstairs...Actually kind of creepy but we were into that I guess? Headed upstairs and the place is beautiful, this very James Bond M -esque woman, who is the owner or a manager greets us and she's accented and fabulous. The waitresses look so classy and librarian bombshell in lace dresses and long pearl necklaces. The bartenders wear untied bow ties...Ugh. This place makes me feel inadequate but I love it regardless.  So for my second dinner of the night, a co-worker split a burger with bacon jam and a too many good things to remember. The menu changes often though, themed on playwriting and storytelling. The menu is separated into categories like intro, prologue, plot, finale, etc. This place is fantastic and classy and a nice place to relax, have a drink or two and some fantastic food."}
{"text":"We came in from Chicago for the weekend. At almost 5 stars, we were excited to check it out and celebrate my birthday dinner. Unfortunately, the food was so salty it was hard to eat more than a few bites. We had the smoked salmon and gem salad for our app and the miso cod and short rib for our main. I will say the wtf biscuits were tasty but that was it. The desserts were amateur and not good. Again, just a couple bites of that and we were over it pretty quickly. We also asked for vodka and grey goose. They didn't have goose so we opted for Tito's. What we got was a cheap rubbing alcohol of some sort. Service was subpar; we had to ask for utensils after our food was brought out. Pretty disappointed overall."}
