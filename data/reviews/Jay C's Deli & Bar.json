{"text":"I went there on a Saturday morning for breakfast with the family.  The good: Food is good, above average breakfast taste. Seats were available and we could choose where to seat. TV's for us men to watch sports (they were live soccer that morning, but they prefer showing a replay of a baseball game?). The \"J'ai faim\" plates (\"I'm hungry\") are a good size. You can have two orders of the same meat on those plates. Waitresses are young, but nice. Always had coffee refills during the meal.   The bad: The \"J'ai faim\" plates were separated in two, which makes them look empty. Asking for \"fruits\" gave me one piece of cantaloup and one piece of orange. A little more generous on fruits, please? Bathrooms are EXTREMELY small, and not that clean (or looks unclean). When we came in, there was jam on the floor that no one noticed (until we mentioned it). Same thing for a fork that fell of a plate that a waitress could not pick up and a customer ended up picking it up.  The place is actually a restaurant/bar place. But they do good on breakfasts. A little expensive but worth it."}
