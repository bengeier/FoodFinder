{"text":"The owner of this restaurant was the executive chef of Great Taste. The food here is authentic northern China cuisine. Not busy place for dinner. The food taste is great, new menu items displayed on the wall (in Chinese), definitely worth to try out."}

{"text":"I came here for dinner with my family for Fresh Taste's supposedly authentic Northern Chinese cuisine. 

My first disappointment was they refused to honor the 5% check in discount. They claimed a \"customer\" made it up. 

Second, although their menu is extensive and reasonably priced, the execution of their dishes was poor. The dumplings tasted like they've gone bad and the other dishes were obviously microwaved; they came out warm on the outside but cold on the inside. Do NOT get the stir fried seaweed dish. It is disgusting. 

The only redeeming factor was the staff were friendly and more attentive than other Chinese establishments. I work close by and haven't tried their lunch menu yet but I sure hope it's a lot better than their dinner. I'll report again when I try it."}
{"text":"I'm giving this four stars because the food is fresh, the tables are clean and the staff try their best. This might be a three-star joint, but I thought about it... And it would be upsetting if they closed. So four stars it is!

This is a lunchtime place you can get food quickly, and it is hot and delicious. So if you work around the area, this is perfect. I once came in at 11, they didn't have items ready. That was a disappointment. She should've told me that most dishes wouldn't be ready instead of saying they would be as she ran my credit card. 

A lot of the food here is fried. Think of the Chinese food you get at a mall. So it's perfect if you are looking into gaining weight. If you are health-conscious, I know they have some stirfried green beans, stirfried vegetables with beef.

It's delicious enough to try it at least once and make up your own mind."}
