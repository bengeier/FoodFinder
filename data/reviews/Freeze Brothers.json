{"text":"Mediocre experience ... The ice cream was waaaay too soft and didn't stand on the cone. Toppings were good but nothing out of the ordinary. 
The man serving us looked like he couldn't care less about having customers.
 I recommend you go somewhere else if you want really good dipped soft serve ice cream."}
{"text":"Delicious, creamy soft serve and a variety of dips from noir to caramel. This ice cream is tops."}
{"text":"Ice cream dipping places are popping up all over the city like mushrooms after the rain. I'm glad this one was open after we watched the fireworks for a bit. (Skipping the end of the fireworks for ice cream is what we did)

The flavour was very good. Loved the Duce de l√®che coat, but the ice cream was not very cold, so I lost a chunk of my precious coat to the floor. I was grieving for at least a min, and pondered briefly about picking it back up to eat it.....alas I resisted.

:(

The place is small but decorated like a old fancy hunting house. (See pic) great for instagram but not sure how I feel abt the two animal heads while I chowed down on my cold dessert."}
