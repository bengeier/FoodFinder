{"text":"Quiet and secluded the place may be but well worth the trip, beutiful building refurbished to the very high standard. Top class flood with excellent service. Little bits make the differance in my opinion and this place does it well even having Multon Brown hand wash in the toliets ( like I say small things) 5* + well done Olde Coach House we will return soon"}
{"text":"Beautiful establishment with very helpful employees. The lamb burger I ordered was delicious, as was the Eton's mess I had for dessert. I missed the starter dish, but my fellow diners seemed to enjoy theirs. The washrooms were also clean and in good condition. If I could find an excuse to be back in the neighbourhood, I'd be back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Had a pleasant lunch at the Olde Coach House.  Inviting atmosphere with a nice variety of sandwiches.  I ate light with a starter and tasty pumpkin leek soup.  Others tried fish and chips and Espetada while sausage sandwich was a hit with a delicious side salad."}
