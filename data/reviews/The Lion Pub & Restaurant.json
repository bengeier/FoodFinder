{"text":"Local, hometown pub with great lived-in vibe and big spaces for big groups. Too bad my service was so meh.  This review's a quickie. I've been to the Lion before, because it is a stone's throw from the hockey arena where I play. The jumbo wings are great, not too greasy and very little unhealthy skin, which is great. So we headed over after our last game in our tournament this past weekend.  Atmosphere:  Rather British, I would say. Dark wood panels, uptight squares, assortment of tables on the bar side. The place is quite large for an independent bar, with two full rooms that could easily hold three hockey teams each. One more of a bar space, the other more of a restaurant area. Nice and homey but clean, but not too clean, just the way I like my bars.  Food: We were in a brunchey mood. We ordered English Breakfast and I got a coffee. It came with scrambled eggs, brown toast, some chunky potato home fries, bacon and two pieces of maple sausage. A tasty heart attack. You can tell I don't order this sort of thing much anymore, huh? The eggs were decent, but the bacon was hard and dry. The sausage was slightly sweet and nicely browned and simple. The menu said it came with fruit, and that meant two orange slices.  The potatoes were the best thing, nicely spiced but not too salty. Could have been charred a little I suppose but I liked them the best. The portion was decent, big enough to share only if you weren't ravenous.  I probably wouldn't come for brunch again, but their wings are solid and if their brunch potatoes are good, I bet their fries are too.  Service: This is where I wasn't too impressed. Not a great attitude from our server, who seemed to find smiling a difficulty. At least our food came on time, but asking her directly for things (such as milk instead of cream for my coffee) seemed like I was inconveniencing her a little bit. Right. Nothing too terrible, just not what I've had there before. It's never been spectacular, but it's never been as meh.   Overall: Come for the independent, hometown bar atmosphere or to watch a game with a big bunch of friends. Come for brunch if you want something old-school, simple, and pretty greasy. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Decided to pull in for a drink and a small snack. Boyfriend got an IPA and we decided to share the spinach&artichoke dip. The chips were clearly stale but we don't complain often because we know how it is sometimes. While we were paying for our meal boyfriend wanted to just let her know that the chips were stale. She responds \"thats funny, a lot of people complain that they are stale but its corn chips so its suppose to taste stale. I personally don't like it but yea\". Great response. Don't ever tell people that anything is \"suppose\" to taste stale. 2 star for the ice cold water and good IPA."}
{"text":"New management... worth a second try!  Took the family here for Sunday brunch. The buffet was really well done... eggs, pre-made omelettes, bacon, sausages, waffles, pancakes, French toast, fruit... all very good and very fresh! All for $12 ($6 for kids)! Excellent service too.  Keep up the good work!  Update: Buffet food quality declined over the last three visits--e.g., replacing all the fresh fruit with canned, very dry eggs. I would pay more for better food."}
{"text":"I'd give the food and drink 4 stars.  If you like pub food you'll enjoy The Lion.    I'd give the wait staff a 2 star.  Wait staff is usually pretty laid back. It isn't bad unless you are looking for another pint or some mayo on the side or something.  Great patio in the summer.  Overall a 3"}
{"text":"Good drinks, bad service,  terrible food.  Finally found a place with both Guinness and Strongbow on tap, a great black velvet!...little did I know at the time that this would be the highlight.  Wife had the chicken curry, I had the 14oz prime rib which is their special...only served Friday and Saturday.   Chicken curry was basically bland chicken on top of bland rice with sauce on top and stirred together....sweet and gross.  I asked for medium-rare prime rib and ended up getting a fatty and blue rare piece of meat which was inedible.  After 10 mins of this in front of me and no waitress to be seen...I just ate the sides,  except for the yorkshire pudding which was like eating thin cardboard.  After I had finished the sides, the waitress finally comes over and says \"Why didn't you tell us, we could have heated it up for you\" ugh.  Do yourself a favor and give this place a miss."}
{"text":"Breakfast buffet, 12.00.   Scrambled eggs, omelette, eggs benedict, sausage, bacon, sweet sausage, belgian waffle, cheesy mashed potatoes, homefries, pancakes, french toast, assorted fruits, juices and coffees.  Basically what I am trying to say is that ots not a basic egg, bacon, toast buffet. For $12, this buffet exceeded my expectations. Yes, some dishes *eggs benedict* may not look as appetizing as they would if they were fresh, but you can eat 5 eggs benedicts if you really want to. You know what I mean?   Good food, very good price. Pretty happy."}
