{"text":"Like all of the other reviews have said this place is cheap for the amount of food you get. Also the food is not bad at all! My co workers and I would go and get lunch specials and bring them back to the office. I wouldn't recommend taking anyone in there to impress because it's a super small \"whole in the wall\" atmosphere. Because they are so small and prices are so low they do get busy at lunch with regulars. The women who serve in there are not the nicest. They are all about business and want to rush you out of there after you eat your food. Again, Food is good and plenty of it for the price but question about going in there because of the service. Order it to go!"}
{"text":"Good, Cheap, Chinese and Food - add Buffett and it is explains why Outlook has recurring event function. I would be tempted to live off the $3.50 lunch specials, but I would burn up my savings with time and gas.  Combos come with rice, egg roll, crab puff and chicken wing. A la Carte comes with soup, rice, and fortune cookie (Take out = no soup)  Menu does not have some standards, i.e., almond chicken - but cashew is certainly acceptable. Sauce abundant but thin, flavors are not bold, and \"spicy\" is not. However, value for $ is substantial and got plenty of spicy with addition of hot oil.  They are tucked into a strip mall with little to no visibility. My sister has lived less than a mile from there for years and did not know it was there. I would not have found this place without Yelp -Thank You."}
{"text":"Lady in the white shirt was so rude. Rushed me out of the restaurant within 20 minutes of me sitting down.  Won't ever go there again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I've had their food twice now and never been disappointed. The staff are super sweet and friendly! The food was made extremely fast. My hubby and will definitely be coming more often to try out different foods!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden jewel. They have good food at great prices. It's hot, fresh and lots of it. It is not a fancy place. There are no daily specials. Just a great place for the time challenged that want a good meal.   It is family owned and run. Everything is prepared and cooked on the premises. Can't go wrong having a meal here."}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best Chinese food I've had. What a pleasant surprise for an assuming little place in a strip mall. The egg drop soup was the best I've eaten and my lunch was $4.75!  It fed me twice!!!"}
{"text":"Years ago, this place was awesome. I think they changed management at some point and since then it has seemed to decline more and more. The last time I went, I ordered Mongolian beef. It looked nothing like what Mongolian beef should look like. It was full of different vegetables when it only should have contained onions. At first, I thought they'd given me the wrong order but he assured me that it was correct. It tasted like a combination of other dishes on the menu. It was not good and not what I was expecting. The staff is always very polite and the service is fast, so I added a star for that, but the food has declined to the point that I doubt I'll return"}
{"text":"I have to give this place 4 stars based on value alone. I don't know how they stay in business. Not because the food or service sucks, it doesn't, but because a lunch plate that provides 2 meals for me costs $3.99. Soup, an egg roll, and a pile of fried rice and Kung pao chicken. $3.99!? And the food is decent. Not great but good enough that I've been back a few times already. $3.99!"}
{"text":"needed to a get a quick meal and chinnise sounded good this was close by and the prices were quite right lunch starting at 3.99 for a full lunch egg roll. rice, soup and main..food was good for the price and were quick with parparing things and having it ready for take out. will return and try something new.."}
{"text":"Been coming here a couple of years now. The food is pretty average for a Chinese food place. The interior is nothing to write home about. But the fact that when I walk in I'm greeted by a big welcoming smile along with the price for lunch keep bringing me back. I have figured out the #1 house chicken is my favorite (extra spicy). I come here once every other week or so, but when I walk in they immediately recognize me and ask if I want the house chicken. This is a nice touch in our crazy world and one that I appreciate. Also if you ask to sub the egg roll for the chicken wings you'll get 2 wings those are pretty great as we'll."}
{"text":"First time I ate here was 20 years ago n I loved it.  Through the years anytime I'm in the area I try to stop   The service has improved - I recalled being asked to leave a tip at some point (rude) but nonetheless their food is prices just right.  My favorite is lemon chicken. And the best crab puffs.  Their soups are pretty good as well"}
{"text":"this place is the worst. I'm from CT and i have been looking all over AZ; for over a the year i have been here, for a good chinese restaurant that atleast can taste or even see some good fried rice or even fried regular chicken wings, not a chicken wing with the meat and skin pulled down the bone to look leg a chicken leg..lol crazy. But this restaurant was the worst i have been to since i have been here. The so called fried rice was just white rice that they tried to fry and then sprayed the sauce over it but when i stirred the rice around the bottom was still white rice......and over cooked, the egg roll they gave us was soggy because they put it in the container with the steamy rice and chicken instead of leaving it out separately to let it stay crispy and the worst were the so called hot and spicy wings, they gave me half parts of different wings, it was supposed to contain 5 pieces but it only had 4 but 1 half drumette wing was regular looking, 1 side wing was regular looking, then the other piece was a big chuck of a weird looking piece of chicken???, 1 piece was one of those crazy pulled down wing and it all sucked!!!! This place sucks, i can't believe they are open for business."}
{"text":"Yes! Yes!,  It may be a whole in the wall but a great place to eat! Fast, friendly and great on pricing!   SO much food for so little price ! Good call on this place!"}
{"text":"have used this chinese takeout a lot but lately food portions have gone downhill,just last night ordered triple delight and i bet that they were maybe two tiny shrimp mixed in with a lot of broccoli and little else,i used to get at least six or seven huge shrimp,i think that was my last visit!"}
{"text":"I had the house chicken today. As usual it was hot and tasty. I was in and out in no time. Next time I am going to try the lemon chicken.  Not much to look at, but food is predictably good."}
{"text":"This may family favorite Chinese restaurant. The price is good and portions are great"}
{"text":"I wish I could write some original witty review, but I have to repeat whats been said before.  It's super cheap, there is absolutely no decor, the lunch special was enough for me to take home as dinner as well, it was fun reveling in a ridiculously value-saturated lunch with 4 strangers.  Egg roll sucks and egg drop soup fairly bland, but entree was fine and surprisingly the fried rice and kung pao chicken were not too greasy.  Definitely will become a weekly lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Try this place after my sister had mention to me how good this place it was very good. The food was very good, we arrive immediately we had a server it did not. Not even 10 for our food to get. After we had our food, the waitress will go to oitlr table often to make sure if we were okay. I like this place!! Good service"}
{"text":"Interesting place. Seems to be family owned and operated. Tip: don't go near closing, which is 8:00pm. They start cleaning and rush you out lol Food was tasty and interesting. I had the triple seafood with veggies. It was veggies, shrimp, scallops, and 'imitation crab' (haha)   Strange but oddly good. I could have done without the 'crab'.  I may come back to try the shrimp with lobster sauce. My boyfriend got it with fried rice. The sauce was a white sauce instead of a typical brown sauce. Looked good. Portions were definitely large and a great value."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time got shrimp fried rice and chicken lo mein i liked both they just needed a little more flavor like salt or something the noodles are my favorite I just with it was more tasty ."}
{"text":"We ordered Mongolian Beef that was full of vegetables served with rice and egg roll. My husband had Moo Gai Pan and had to have his chicken recooked.  It originally came out slimy and undone. They took it back and next try looked just the same....raw slimy rubber appearance like uncooked spoiled meat. Mongolian beef should only have green ions and beef. My dish had every vegetable and the meat tasted funny. Our egg roll was terrible and we could not eat  them.   If you value your stomach and your wallet. Don't eat here.  In all our years together and eating out 4-5 times a week, this is the FIRSt time we have ever left our dinners basically untouched."}
{"text":"Always enjoyed my take out food. Excellent prices. Call ahead it can be backed up at dinner time if you are getting take out."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep ordering Chicken Egg Foo Yong from this place.  Perhaps because the lunch special price is cheap at $4.92.  However, there is so much sauce laden on the egg that you can't even taste it.  This is the 3rd time that I've had this dish and the 1st time was pretty decent, the last 2 times were terrible.  I don't know if they changed their cooks but if/when I come back, I will order something else.  The place gets packed at lunch so they have to be pretty decent."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese fast food.  Lunch specials for $4.95 and very clean restrooms.  The owner always remembers you."}
{"text":"excellent lunch dishes.  portions are huge.  try the chicken chow mein-the best."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since i was born lol this is my favorite chines food place every dish I've tried is delicious! My personal favorite is the shrimp chow main  their egg drop soup is super good, the plates come in combos that include rice two crab puffs and two wings and they are big portions! By far the best chines place"}
{"text":"This food is so gross. It's nothing like Chinese food.  We tried it as we were on that side of town, and never again.  We literally threw it away after a few bites.  I'd say the only good thing about this place is that it's cheap, but it doesn't even out because we had to toss the food.  Absolutely terrible!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I work just down the street and a group of my coworkers go here every Thursday - they call it \"Cheap Chinese Thursday.\" The food is INSANELY cheap - like, between $3 and $4 for lunch, and it's pretty good. The Lemon Chicken is my personal favorite, and I'd go every Thursday if not for the MSG headache. The egg rolls aren't good, though, but seriously, for $3, this place is pretty great. They also have a community table in the middle, which is cool since it's usually packed at lunch and you can usually grab a seat or two at the group table. And, oh yeah: CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"It's an unassuming Chinese restaurant with good food and ridiculously low prices. A regular lunch spot for me, since it's near my office.  Service is very quick as they make every effort to get you out to make room for the next customer. Not the kind of place where you can lounge around as you will receive a look from the staff that clearly says it's  time to go. But the good food and great prices make the former easy to get past."}
{"text":"By far one of the worst chinese food I have ever had. The prices were low though. Like the old saying goes \"you get what you pay for\""}
{"text":"As has been noted by the other reviewers, China Restaurant (kudos for the creative name!) is CHEAP. If you've only got $5 for lunch, this is where you want to be.  The food is not very authentic (it's Americanized Chinese, what do you expect?), but it is very tasty. I make a point of trying something different every time, and I'm there 2-3x weekly. It's close to my work, and did I mention that's it's cheap? Most lunch combos are around $3.50, with dinners around $5. Dinner combos pile on the sides: wings, wontons, eggroll, and rice as well as a large entree. The quality of the food is surprisingly good, considering the price. Dine-in meals include a bowl of decent egg drop soup.  China Restaurant does accept credit cards. I work with the guy who convinced them to start taking plastic, and Cindy, the very friendly and efficient manager, agrees that this was a great move. So, all you non-cash-carrying people, you've got no more excuses to avoid the place."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very good. Been in business at this location for over 20 years. Prices are low. Portions are large. Strange peanut sauce on the egg fu yung instead of the traditional brown sauce, but it is good and you can substitute the brown.  Everything is consistently delicious. Service is good. Very busy lunch business on weekdays so call in your order if you can. Also they take Visa and Mastercard now so no need for cash on hand."}
{"text":"stopped in while in town for business. Super cheap, super fast and super good. Egg drop soup was the best Ive ever had. I then got the Triple delight combo. It was ready in moments, steaming hot. Crab puffs are liaded with garlic, yummmo. Egg roll was good, and fried rice was terrific. Huge plate of food and it was only $8.00!! If in in town again, I will definitely stop in. Try it, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Found China Restaurant (clever name don't ya think) end of last year when a friend took me there and have been going since then. I dig the community seating, it gives it a family feel. Plus I am a people person so it just forces conversation with people. Service is fast & you don't have to wait long for your food. Lunch time you can eat for under 5 bucks and come out feeling full. I have tried a few of their dishes, beef broccoli, mongolain beef, and pepper beef and asked them to make them extra spicy and they turn out great! Yea their dishes are heavy on the sauce but I find that the fried rice goes well with the sauce, the lunch combo comes with egg drop soup (I don't care for it, but not cuz of the place just not a fan of eggs) egg roll fried rice & meal all for under 5 bucks! Can't beat that! When you want a fast cheap lunch and not from a fast food joint, give China Restaurant a try!"}
{"text":"Good inexpensive quality food. One of the best values out there. Good service. Very friendly staff.  Probably cheaper than making the food at home."}
{"text":"This place is awesome .  Although the place looks older the food is great and the employees are friendly. The lunch specials run around $5.00 and that was with a soda! I will post some pictures during my next visit.  If your looking for some good Chinese and are in the area stop in."}
{"text":"China Restaurant is one of our favorites to visit when we are in town.  Fresh food, wonderful taste and the prices can't be beat.  We had to move to Tulsa for our work, but come back to see family still living in the Valley when we can.  Every trip includes a stop here to relive the wonderful food on the menu.  Heartily recommended."}
{"text":"I feel very fortunate to have found this place. The portions are American style (huge) but the food is very much what you would expect from a stereotypical Chinese restaurant and wonderfully inexpensively priced. I am a big fan of the fried rice but everytime we go I bring somebody who tries a lunch combo and appreciates the volume, price, and quality of the food."}
{"text":"Great place to eat for some Chinese food... Lo mein wasn't my favorite, but it wasn't bad. My boyfriend and I both got the sesame chicken, and it was delicious. Perfectly cooked with great flavor. No complaints!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I have been here more than 50 times and continue to return.  Family owned.  Good food.  Good service.  EXCELLENT prices.  This no frills looking place is a neighborhood gem that is not to be missed."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is 3 star, but the price makes it 4 star.  They usually have way too much sauce, but it's not too bad otherwise.  If you're looking for a huge lunch for less that $4, it really can't get much better than this.  By far not the best, but it'll do in a pinch and the price can't be beat."}
{"text":"I eat here at least weekly and sometimes as much as 5 times a week. I almost always order Kung Pao chicken which they do well. I love their egg rolls too. They are very generous with the portions and very inexpensive. They are the best tasting Chinese food in the area."}
{"text":"Panda Express sounds good. I only gave them 2 stars because it was dirt cheap."}
{"text":"Locally owned, AMAZING PRICES! Staff was on the ball and we were asked several times if we needed anything. The portion size was really impressive! I had plenty to take home and have dinner as well! You can't beat it! Two meals for about $5! Will definitely return! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Based off the reviews my coworkers and I decided to come here because we wanted authentic Chinese food. I got the chicken with veggies, everything was covered with white clear gooey sauce. My egg roll was wet, everything looked like a big gooey mess. The chicken looked boiled and not appealing. I literally had to throw it away I couldn't even try it. My workers all felt the same and we all agreed we wouldn't come back. I'd skip this place and go to Panda Express."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. This is a family owned place I have been coming to for years.The prices are low and the food is hot and quickly prepared. Large portions as well."}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall type place, it is very small and gets crowded. That being said, the service was good. It appeared clean (although I did not check out the restroom). The Egg drop soup was very good (and I am normally not a fan of that soup). The egg rolls, just stay away from them. They are horrible, like seriously. I ordered broccoli beef. The plates are massive. The food was ok. It wasn't a bad experience, but I am not impressed, and probably will not be back."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food ive had in Gastonia County. Since moving to NC from Connecticut it was hard finding good Chinese food. Their food is flavorful and reminds me more of The Chinese food up north. Their egg rolls are delicious. The steamed dumplings are crave worthy. Just all around good food. Their pork fried rice is crave worthy as well. I highly recommend China as the best Chinese food in the area."}
{"text":"If there was a -$ rating for pricing- China Restaurant would get it.  The majority of the menu is  less than $5.  The fact that their food is so cheap actually makes me wonder about some things... but I try to avoid letting my mind wander.  Honestly, their food is mediocre.  I had the house chicken which came with soup, a hefty plate of rice, chicken and an egg roll.  The chicken was a overcooked and drowned in too much sauce as a cover up.  The rice was cooked fine however, and I did enjoy the egg roll and soup.  I went during lunch and they were very busy but the service was super fast. It is really a small space and they don't have much seating however there are a couple of large circular tables in the middle where they will sit anyone who needs a seat.  That's kind of cool to me.  I can imagine it's a good way to meet people that work around the area.  This place is a pushover into the four star realm for me.  If they were ever to raise their prices to be more expensive than McDonalds, it would turn into a 3. But no complaints for right now- if you need a cheap place to eat, this is on the top of my list."}
{"text":"This is like a fast food Chinese restaurant. Very simple and you won't get a culinary masterpiece. Still, a great little place. I didn't order a beverage with lunch and got out for under $7, which included a 25-30% tip. The portions are even good. Way better tasting than McDonald's and I was in and out in 20 minutes. Wow!  If you come at lunch, you may be seated at a big table with other parties of fewer than 4. Didn't bother me at all and I was able to get some advice on what to order from some regulars."}
{"text":"Seriously good spot, but I feel like a piggy when I'm out of there lol. But that doesn't have to do with the food, lol I really like their egg drop soup there, not the best,  but its up there."}
{"text":"Pros: Big portions, food was quick. Orange chicken was good (needs more sauce)  Cons: I asked for Spicy Mongolian Beef and got normal beef. Hardly any sauce. Sides were atrocious."}
{"text":"Stopped by here a few weeks ago after work for some dinner. We ordered fried rice and orange chicken. There was a young woman behind the counter who took our order and she was very polite. We got the order to go and it only took about 8 to 10 minutes to prepare. When we got home and opened our meals they were still pipping hot. Both dishes were very tasty and portions were large for the price. They appear to have amazing lunch specials also that I plan on checking out in the future.   *When I cracked open my fortune cookie there was no fortune inside. Is that bad luck???"}
{"text":"I have been eating at China Restaurant since 1997. The place looks pretty beat up, it always has, however don't let looks fool you. The chef in the back has been doling out hundreds of lil gem dishes for years and years. With very affordable lunch menu and a hurry up and eat and leave attitude, this place is great.  I highly recommend lunch here and even dinner. Good food (A LOT) fast service.  Have eaten here a hundred times or more, never sick, always full, and my wallet still with money in it."}
{"text":"Cheap and good for the price, lunch special includes fried rice, egg roll, soup and entree.  Will continue to ear here when working in the area"}
