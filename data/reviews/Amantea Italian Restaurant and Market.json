{"text":"Nothing grinds my gears more than a downtown restaurant that doesn't know how to hustle during the lunch hour. I have places to be! I got the vegetarian Panini which was good but the minestrone soup was not great. The taste was OK but it was pretty much tomato soup with bits of celery and parmesan in it. No pasta, no beans, nothing that would make it a Minestrone soup. I also bought a cookie to go from the counter and took one bite then threw it away. It had no taste to it at all. I think that's probably the first time I've ever discarded a cookie in my life."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery to our hotel late Friday night after traveling from California. The food was incredible. The pizza was thin and cooked perfectly. The pasta was delicious. We are recommending this restaurant to all our friends and family who live here."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Great authentic Italian food and wines. We ate here twice in the same week and both times we had great service. The first time we had the Hawaiian pizza and the second time we enjoyed meatballs with spaghetti. The house red wine was really good for the price.   This restaurant includes a nice lunch deli counter with panini, soup, salad, pasta and more.  Great place for the business traveler within walking distance one block from two hotels.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Really great wood fired pizza, good Italian wine selection. Nice romantic atmosphere. I had the Margherita pizza which was excellent. The service staff is knowledgeable and friendly. The place is well laid out and during the summer they have the windows open to get some fresh air inside"}
{"text":"Came in around 8pm and were 1 of 3 tables in the restaurant (the other two were finishing up when we arrived.)  House wine was $5 and was an OK glass of pinot grigio. Also tried the Cha-Cha Chocolate cocktail for $13 and found it to be way too sweet. Insta-cavities.  Shared the special pizza of the day, the Country ($15): sliced apple, bacon, roasted garlic, blue cheese and maple syrup. At first, we weren't sure we liked it - there are a lot of things going on with this pizza. There would be bites where it was very salty from the bacon and the blue cheese, and some that were very sweet from the pools of syrup. Couldn't taste the apple at all. Once in a while you'd get the perfect combination and it was a good balance. The dough, however, was delicious. Crispy enough to hold up when you picked it up, but still soft enough to give the perfect amount of chew.    Tiramisu was a large portion but I found it to be a bit dry and lacking in flavour.   Also lost stars for slow service. Though it was not busy, we had to wait quite a long time for our drinks and water. The pizza was fresh but a heads up on the wait would have been appreciated. Meal came to just under $50 before tip.   I'd maybe come back to order a different pizza or try one of the pasta dishes. There are just so many food options around, I wasn't blown away to make it my top choice."}
{"text":"The food is delicious so what more can I say.  I didn't get a chance to eat in as I had planned so I used a local delivery service. When my food arrived it was still hot, well packaged and absolutely deliciously authentic.  I would highly recommend the Arancini."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic! From the house wine to the pizza, everything exceeded expectations. The atmosphere was great. A mix between a bar and bistro. The restaurant was a lot bigger than we thought it would be. Cozy and intimate at the same time. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good food. Very slow service at their lunch counter. Would like it to accept American Express."}
{"text":"The linguine with clams which was excellent, light oil-based sauce, seafood with fresh clear flavours. Service was excellent and attentive. Pricing: $15-20 range for nice pasta entrees with quality ingredients, though portions are on the smaller side of average.  This place is huge, ambiance is very laid back and unpretentious. Wouldn't bring a date here but the quality food and the ample space make it a good place for foodie friends and large groups. Deli on site sells cheese and dry pasta."}
{"text":"Great food, quiet atmosphere.  Good bet for a last minute meal at a local gem.  Lunch and pizza are always a safe bet."}
{"text":"This location has a warm inviting atmosphere. While I ordered mine to go, I was welcomed as I entered and was quickly served. I ordered the Manicotti - 3 Shells - Pasta Stuffed with Ricotta Cheese and Spinach Baked in a Creamy Tomato Sauce ($15.95). It was very good."}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars for being straight up good classic old school Italian.  If you're craving home made baked lasagna or manicotti it can be found here.  The tomato sauce is authentic and full of flavour.  The arancini was the perfect blend of crispy and gooey on the inside paired with a fantastic marinara sauce to dip it in.  Kudos to the classic caesar salad as well- Crisp romaine hearts, beautiful dressing (not overpowering). To top it off the house red wine was only 30 bucks for a bottle and while it wasn't the most amazing red wine by any means it was extremely flavourful and fruity for the price point.  A fun atmosphere of live music created a well rounded evening of homestyle Italian cooking and upbeat casual fun"}
