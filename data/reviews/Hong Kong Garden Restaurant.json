{"text":"Excellent Chinese restaurant.  Food was fast, hot and delicious.  We had ginger fried beef, moo goo gai pan and mushroom fried rice.  Everything was fantastic.  Service was great and the bill was decent.  Lots of pickups while we were eating so the food is definitely popular.  I think we've found our new \"local\" Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"A family favorite,  we go there often and are usually impressed.  The staff are friendly and the restaurant is clean. Most dishes are very tasty generally good value. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We are regular customer. Good customer service and their food would satisfy your palate and tummy. The same for pick up foods."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese food and reasonably priced. We ordered the ginger beef, crispy chicken, and cantonese chow mein. All tasted good. We've ordered for pick up and delivery."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why I bother ever ordering from anywhere else. I love Hong Kong garden so much it hurts. especially when I'm hung over."}
{"text":"This is still one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Calgary. I only discovered it a few years ago when I moved to the Bridlewood area, and I'm so glad I did. The family that runs it are really friendly and hard working, and always make you feel welcome. Their ginger beef is my favorite, fresh and crispy everytime. Whenever I'm craving Chinese, I come here!"}
{"text":"Went there a few time its the best Chinese food I've had the staff is great an very professional the portions are huge this will be my go to place"}
{"text":"We went at lunch hour when there was only one other table in the restaurant. We were given the lunch special menu which we ordered off of. The food came out very quickly and the quantity of the lunch special was large. However, as more customers filed in, we noticed that they were given the lunch special menu as well as the full menu. When confronted about this, the waitress told us that we were welcome to order from the full menu, just need to let her know. No explanation why we were not given the full menu or apologies. We already ate our food and didn't want to order anything more.   I am very disappointed at the different treatment that we received than the other customers, hence the 2 stars. The service was fast, the quantity was large, and the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"Neat and clean, friendly place. Good for kids. Owners are good. Lots of parking. Chicken corn soup and stir fry vegetable are pretty good."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant for the first time on my birthday with my friend and have been here 5 times ever since. The menu is in English which helps a basically illiterate Chinese girl like me. Staff only speaks English and canto but no mandarin, which is fine. Friendly staff, fast service, and cheap prices. I ordered two dishes with steamed rice and it only ran $40 including tip. Beef tenderloin hot plate( available spicy nor non spicy) and Szechuan eggplant are my favourites and are all I order. For kids there's fried rice, all my little brother eats. many drink options available and they don't automatically serve you tea as in most Chinese restaurants. The restaurant isn't very busy, lots of seating, and they always tell people yo sit wherever they like, as if the restaurant is like coming home for good homemade meals.And recently I got a calendar as a Christmas gift and fortune cookies as always!"}
{"text":"The food is fine but twice now, several months apart, when we've ordered delivery they've \"forgotten\" a dish. When we called about it the first time, they offered us a credit which we took because it was going to take too long for them to be delivered. Said credit has never been applied to any subsequent order so clearly they don't actually make a record of it anywhere. The second time, last night, they forgot a dish from our order and we refused the so-called credit and demanded they deliver the dish for free. Too bad, because lousy service can ruin a good thing. Won't bother with this place again."}
{"text":"We had great plans for New Year's Eve... there was tickets, themed outfits and champagne to be involved. However the evil little cold bug hit and ruined everything. It was late afternoon when all I wanted to do now was sit in my pajamas, eat Chinese food and watch movies (in self-pity of course) to ring in the new year.   So, with that in mind and thinking that everyone else is going to be out having a fun time, I call to place an order first at a different location at 5pm. I am told very politely that they will not take orders until after 8pm... because they are crazy busy. Since I'm hungry, sick and just kind of want to have dinner before 9pm I decided to try out Hong Kong Gardens... I heard good things.  We walk in to place the order and I am very shocked at the line, it's at the door! So, we wait for maybe 10 minutes and our order gets taken and are told to come back at 7pm for pick up... however when we arrive back... it was even crazier than before! (I guess everyone had the same idea) I think they could have fixed this by doing what the previous company I called did and just tell people no... but well.... They didn't.   We didn't get our food until about 45 minutes after originally told and it was like waiting in line for a lottery, just hoping when they bring out the next bag from the kitchen that they call out your phone number. Some people were quite agitated.... I didn't mind too much.   Once we brought it home we indulged in the prearranged group dinner for 2 (includes: ginger beef, sweet-sour pork, fried rice, spring rolls & mixed veggies) we also got a large wonton soup...  First off, portions are very generous. I found the spring rolls to be just meh but everything else tasted fresh and was just what I was craving, it even tasted good the next day - with the exception of the ginger beef being on the chewy side when reheated but that's probably my fault.  Overall I must say I was happy with the end result, I will just not go again on New Year's!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best Canadian Chinese foods in calgary. I was so happy to find them. They are my go to comfort food!"}
{"text":"We went on Boxing Day, they were busy and the owner seemed stressed out and was a bit rude.  When the bill came, he had added the tip automatically because he said we had a large group, we had 6 people in our group.  However he added the tip again when I paid with my credit card.  I was with family so wasn't paying attention but noticed once I got home that he charged me the tip twice.  So make sure you check your bill before paying."}
{"text":"Team Fam came here for lunch and we ordered the Ginger Beef, Pork Chow Mein, and some rice for good measure. The ginger beef as noted by other reviewers had a good taste to it. The ginger added a nice zing to the crunchy beef. Was it full of MSG? Who knows, but it was kind of like adding a lot of sauce (in this case, sweet ginger) to dry meat, and that's what you have here with the Ginger Beef. What started out promising ends up a dry mess.   The Pork Chow Mein did not fare any better. Sure there was a good amount of pork on top, but it was the same story of having a flavoured exterior with a dry interior. I don't want to say it's on the food court level because this definitely took some time to cook and come out fresh, but I wish it was more moist on the inside."}
{"text":"We've always enjoyed our food here. Always hot and fresh. Their chicken in black bean sauce is great, so is their ginger beef and diced chicken &  cashews in yellow bean sauce (though you better like celery for that dish).   The lemon chicken is the only slight disappointment but it's by far not the worse I've ever had!   The family the owns it seem very nice and by far this is the only Chinese type food (outside of china town area) that we've found worth eating (and not feeling sick after)."}
{"text":"Pretty Decent Chinese Food.  If you call for take out, it's ready in about 15 minutes or less.  The Ginger Chicken is excellent."}
{"text":"Very good food especially their Chicken with Cream Corn Soup.  Delivery is very fast and food is always hot when it arrives.  The restaurant is also very pleasant to eat in and there's lots of parking.  Definitely worth the effort and money to eat there."}
{"text":"This place has been hit and miss.  Tonight was good, ingredients seemed fresh and the deep fryer seemed to have new oil but in past visits we've run into bad tofu and even beef.  I'd go back for a quick dish of something they serve often and in large quantities but stay away from the specialty items on the menu as the ingredients won't be fresh.  The service was pretty good tonight.  This is western Chinese food so expect plates, knives, and forks despite the Chinese print on the menu.  The bathrooms were also acceptable."}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese food in Calgary. We got the dinner for 3 and Shanghai noodles. The food came out quickly and in a good order; First to come out was the wonton soup which was amazing, perfect base and the wontons were great. Then the spring roles. Next was fried rice which again was so good! Had the perfect flavour. We then received our shanghai noodles Which is one of our favourite dishes and they had a perfect amount of sauce and were cooked very well! We got our mixed veggies which I usually think are too salty but here they had just the right amount of sauce, which was nice and I really liked that they still had a little bit of a crunch to them. Lastly we received our ginger beef which was perfectly cooked, which was nice and crisp with the perfect center of well cooked beef and extra saucy which I loved. The food was honestly to die for and just so worth it! Our bill came out to be about 60$ with a couple of drinks. And the portions were HUGE. The service here was amazing, everyone there was so friendly and welcoming. They were always paying attention and my glass was always topped up. Deffinitely a well deserved 5 star rating without a doubt."}
{"text":"Customer service was pretty great. Maybe it was what we ordered but the food was ok. We started with salt and pepper wings. They were good. Large. We asked for sauce and they brought it for us after asking if a dollar extra was ok. We said sure. When the bill came they charged us 2 dollars, and the sauce was no big deal at all. Why bring us bowl of mediocre watery sauce and ask us to pay for that? I don't know. Anyways we pointed it out and they took it off the bill, so extra star for that. Customer service on point.   The shrimp fried rice was very good. Great tasting, nice medium sized shrimp that were plentiful and perfectly cooked.   But ginger beef. This is where the points come off. It was really all batter. Breading. Some pieces didn't even have a piece of beef in it and the ones that did had small tough piece of beef in heaps of batter. Come on.   So for tea, good service, plate of fried rice, plate of ginger beef and an appetizer of chicken wings we paid over $40. Sigh. Come on.   Totally not worth it but wasn't a complete disaster."}
