{"text":"The food is amazing staff friendly and ambiance welcoming and peaceful. My favorite thing in the menu are the grilled turkey chops. I have dined in and have done takeout and it has been consistently good."}
{"text":"I ordered to go a week  ago but just wanted to give the food 5 stars and the friendly staff that took and rang up my order..Chicken and shrimp alfredo,chicken rolls ,and firecracker shrimp appetizer were incredible.Thanks!"}
{"text":"I knew better because I've had not so great service in the past, but someone was having a reservation made ahead Birthday dinner so I tried the place again.  The menu does not offer authentic appetizers. Chicken fingers and fries are not appropriate to be labeled a \"starter.\" Then the \"appetizer\" came out about 2 quarters into the Cavs game. That simple entree should never take that long. Moving on to meal portion....we all ordered at the same time and the food randomly came out. 2 side salads, then 15 minutes later 2 more side salads. After 25 more minutes 2 -3 entrees, then 1 more entree. This left 5 of us with no food for about 15-20 minutes so I ended up canceling my meal and my fianc√©e's meal. It was simply a horrible and inconsistent dining experience at best. Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"They always take extremely too long to produce the food! I don't like that so I really don't eat here!"}
{"text":"Service is Awesome! The chicken, Turkey ribs, Alfredo is delicious. I love the Sangria! Everything I have ordered was very tasty. Nice crowd of people and you feel safe."}
{"text":"Ordered a Chicken Philly through Uber Eats and the food was great! Came hot and fresh. Will order again!"}
{"text":"Went on Wednesday Wing Night. Wings are 40 cents each. I ordered BBQ wings and honey garlic wings. The place reminds me of an old abandonded Western restaurant/bar. Think 'Desperado' bar scene. For only 10 wings, it did take a while for the food to come. You can tell this a place that has a lot of regulars. No one seemed to mind. Most of the people that came in were just ordering food to go or grabbing drinks. But the wings were good! I would definitely recommend the honey garlic wings."}
{"text":"I keep trying and trying to like this place.. It's a hit or miss !! drinks are good food is good whenever you get it. They need help... There service is awful sometimes you will sit over an hour before you get a drink. 2 hours for food come on now... And it doesn't even have to be crowded. Get it to together.. So take you chance.."}
{"text":"We went here after church for Father's day.  I have mixed reviews about this place....

So it took a very long time to get menus, then to order our drinks/food, as well as getting our food.  The reason being that there was only one waitress and she was also the bartender.  She was very nice and friendly but everything we requested took so long for us to receive.

Even though we had an extremely long wait the music was playing was awesome!  I even said to my family that I need their playlist for my Spotify.  OH and we also ran into Wayne Dawson while we were there!

The food took so long to get to our table, that I was so hungry and started eating right away before I could even take pictures!!!!  I am so bummed by this.

When we finally received our food, everything was so good!!!!  My mom order some turkey ribs and she kept commenting of how good they were.  Since I don't eat meat, I had to order all sides.  I had asparagus, fried mushrooms, some of my mom's sweet potato fries, and a side salad.  The sides filled me up and were very tasty.

After we order our food and right before it came out, my sister and I order some adult beverages thinking it would come at the same time as our food... Nope....  We had to cancel our drink order because we were getting ready to leave.

Even though we had to wait a LONG time for our food- everyone who were in my party enjoyed every bite of it.  I highly suggest if you are going to eat at this place is to call ahead, watch a movie or do some shopping before you come and pick up your food.  Oh and it is pretty pricey as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a couple of times and every time we end up disappointed. The drinks are usually good/strong, but the food is subpar. Tonight I got the tilapia Alfredo and the fish was burnt. I asked for penne pasta instead of rice for my husband's dish and he still received rice. I asked for asparagus with my dish, but did not receive it at all. I know I could have asked them to correct it, but the fact of the matter is I should not have to. I should give my order and get what I asked for. And btw, this is every time we order from this place. We will no longer come here."}
{"text":"Food was amazing if u go try the chicken marsala its delish ...the waitress was very nice and took great care of us music was good as well ...cant wait 2 go back again and again."}
{"text":"Ordered my food and had Uber eats deliver. I ordered the starter sampler and made it very clear in caps NO MUSHROOMS SEVERELY ALLERGIC!! Guess what they did, sent my food with mushrooms in it, then when I called about it the chef had the nerve to get on the phone and tell me \"it's fried so USUALLY when fried it wouldn't contaminate the food.\" WTF usually isn't good enough when it comes down to my life!! I told them straight up if I have a reaction I'm suing, then all of a sudden they want to make it \"right\" after arguing with me for 5 minutes to just take it out the container and eat the remaining food. Never will I order from here again!!"}
{"text":"I went there just a couple of hours ago.  This was during a slow time and the bartender took my order.  It was a beautiful day and I must have waited 20 minutes, but I didn't mind.  The bartender offered me a seat and gave me a glass of ice water.  I ordered the Sampler and Wings tossed in Garlic Parmesan sauce which also had fries.  When I got home, the food was still piping hot and delicious!  I must go back for the Turkey ribs!"}
