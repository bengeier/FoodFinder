{"text":"The best 'All u can eat' japanese restaurant in Newmarket!!! The staff and food are great!!!!"}
{"text":"I think for what it is it's very good. Everything that we tried was very tasty. This is our go to place for our sushi fix. The staff are very friendly and accommodating as well.  Akita Sushi in Bradford lost our business to this place."}
{"text":"Usually very good.... Service is fast! Staff is very friendly, they always interact with the kids. The best all you can eat sushi place around here."}
{"text":"This used to be our 'go to' place in newmarket for All You Can Eat japanese food, since there aren't that many in the area.  Their food is average.  The last time we went, and that will be our very last time, we had left over 4 pieces of maki roll and perhaps 3 pieces of chicken cutlet.  The waitress came over and said, \"you have to eat everything!\".  I was quite offended and being regular customers there, I knew the waitress was new.  Anyhow, she was quite rude and said she was going to charge us for every piece that we didn't eat.  I think she was mistaken that she was paying us to have a meal there.  Anyhow, the experience has left such a bad taste in our mouths that we will never go back there. HOW RUDE!"}
{"text":"Great experience for the price you pay   I have been here for years and have been to lunch and dinner. The lunch Is my fave just because I am not a huge fan of the extra dinner options.  The quality of fish is not the best, but for the price you pay it's to be expected. Drinks are free refills, which is nice.  The beef is amazing! We chow down on a huge plate every time. The crunchy rolls (shrimp,mayo,crispy) are an excellent beginner roll. Our fave now is their new ice and fire roll ( crab,cream cheese, deep fried). The tempura is always light and fluffy. Sashimi is a dinner only option, but They offer sushi during lunch though.   They now have a loyalty card so I think after 10 visits you get the next one free.  Overall a nice experience. They have changed management over the years but have kept up with the competition of other sushi shops."}
{"text":"This is most definitely my favourite place to get sushi in newmarket. The female servers are always a little grumpy, but the food comes quick so I'm not complaining. The actual sushi is great, but their hot foods are by far the best compared to every other ayce sushi joint I've been to. Try the fried squid tenticles, theyre addictive!"}
{"text":"Well rounded all-you-can-eat Sushi place in Newmarket. Good, clean environment, friendly hosts."}
{"text":"Great prices for AYCE, not too many options for vegetarian dishes, but the kamikaze avocado roll were delicious!!"}
{"text":"I did not understand how the service was so slow that we were the one of the first few families there before it got crowded and we were the third last family there that night, not by choice or binge.   We ordered and waited 30 minutes before our actual first round came. We had a mind to order wasabi while waiting otherwise it would have been so much longer wait before taking our first bite. I will say that the food was good. Just that I saw they repeatedly served other tables but forgot about ours. I do say \"forgot\" because a few of our orders were missing right until our second and last order. No way we wanted to wait and we couldn't anyways because it was almost 8:45PM!!! We came in right at 6:25PM.   When I asked about our last order of sushi roll, the server said \"I just checked and your is coming right up\". Hmm, right because we are almost the only ones left now. Thank you for giving your attention to our food after everyone else's.   In sum, try not to sit in a booth farthest from the chefs. They might forget you too. I heard a family who sat just one table closer to the chef counter asking about their order status, they left earlier ... came later than us. Hmmm. You know, it got crowded after we ordered our first round but how is it that those people came in and out already?   Anyways, thank you for the food but I would not like to wait every 30 minutes for the next order to come."}
{"text":"This was my first all you can eat sushi experience and I wasn't sure quite what to expect. I was assuming there was going to be a lesser quality product for the $20 per person price tag, but I was pleasantly surprised!  The tempura was awesome, the fish was fresh, and the presentation was very pleasing. Everything you could possibly ask for when you have a sushi craving!  My only complaint is that our waitress obviously did not want to be there, barely saying 3 words to us the entire time we were there, but thats being said, service was prompt.  Overall I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is definatly mine and my boyfriends favourite spot for sushi in newmarket.  The food always looks delicious and tastes fresh! We have found the price is great too, it seems to be a little lower than some of the other spots in the area.  The loyalty card is a great idea too, definatly makes us returning customers!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years as there have always been few AYCE places that actually have survived.  Was there 2 days ago, I must say that their quality and freshness has improved.  Quick service as always and even the soy sauce tasted fresher than in the past.  Keep up the good quality !!"}
{"text":"Average experience at best.  Shrimp tempura came cold and food tasted bland.  Such a shame as this place used to be better.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm a regular to this place, probably been here at least 40 times since moving to Newmarket cause i live a 3 minute walk away. There used to be 3 female servers when I started going here that gave exceptional service, were kind, attending to my needs, and appreciating that I came here often and acknowledged that. This was my go to for sushi due to quality of food, service and convenient location. Back then, I wouldve given 5 stars. But my experience with this place today with the new two female staff members has changed my views. I came in for the lunch AYCE with two people. The place was pretty busy so I saw past the horrible service for a while and was patient with my food and water. Nearing the end of my meal, I had one more order to put in and the lady server looked directly at me with the paper i was holding, gave me a rolling eyed look, and walked away. She then went up to the other female server and started talking in their language with a rude tone, while looking my direction and pointing towards me. They were both clearly very irritated or angry with my table or something but we were never rude to them the whole lunch. When they finally came for my last order after about 30 minutes, the dessert took another 20 minutes and when I asked if it was coming, the lady gave me a rude \"the order's put in already!!\"  Because of their two new female staff members, I will go find a new place regardless of this place being so close to where i live. I miss their old staff and wish their new staff wasnt horrible because the manager is an awesome guy."}
{"text":"A reasonably-priced AYCE Japanese restaurant in Newmarket, conveniently located right across from Upper Canada Mall.  The lunch buffet is priced at $12 for adults and $8 for kids and $4 for toddlers.  Prices do not change on the weekends! There is also an option for a deluxe buffet for $20.  The service here, even though there were several other tables, was amazingly quick. You place your orders by checking off a paper form for the number of items you want (i.e. 2 pieces of eggplant tempura, 1 avocado handroll). Main categories include handrolls, sushi, maki, meat in teriyaki sauce and various kinds of tempura. Other odd items include gyozas and deep-fried spring rolls.  The agedashi tofu was pretty bland, but the edamame and salad, garnished with a light ginger dressing, worked as great starters. As a herbivore, I can't comment on the fish sushi but the inari was tasty, although a bit too sweet. The tamago, on the other hand, wasn't done very well.  The best part? Ice cream is included! You can choose from ginger, mango, green tea, red bean or vanilla. You get a small scoop, but you can always ask for seconds if you're feeling greedy!  Lots of booth seating and tables that can be put together if you've got large groups. 10% discounts are also available for take-out over $25.  A great bargain in a very central location.  3.5/5 stars"}
{"text":"Oh let me start by saying.  Sushi Itto in aurora way better than this place for food!!  That's number one.   Unfortunately, I had a sushi craving today and sushi Itto isn't open on Sundays.  So I ventured out to this place.  My family and I use to come here every other weekend but we got a little ticked off by the service just rude in general so we decided to stop coming hence how we found sushi Itto.    I decided to come here anyways try it out again.  The food isn't bad, nothing to write home about but that wouldn't make me give it a one star.  What does deserve a one star is Pompous ass that was serving us.    He had the nerve to come to me and said we were wasting food!  Never have I ever had someone say this to me because I NEVER waste.  There  was one time at masa in Toronto where I couldn't finish and went to the cash and offered to pay to bring the food home.   Thy charged me $8 and I was happy to pay and tipped VERY well on that. Anyways, this horrible waiter said he took many plates with food, not sure if he's old or just blind or mixing up tables because all my plates were done.  So sorry I didn't know I had to eat every bean sprout on the plate and the shrimp tail for you to believe that it's done.  The only thing I returned was their general Tao chicken which was literally sweet deep fried soggy bread with no hints of recognizable chicken.    So after he comes to tell me this, I am pissed beyond belief and can't finish my meal, I get up to the cash ask him to come see me when he's done serving his tray.  I tell him to bill me whatever he wants but I'm never coming back.  Where he says \"whatever\".  Good way to keep your customers!!! He charge me $5 and an extra $1 on each persons meal.  Think I didn't catch that, please....  Revenge is a dish best served cold and here's mine!!!   Bill come to $41 and I don't tip.  Anyone want to venture why???   Anyways I will keep to my promise, I will never come back.  And just an FYI take a look at all the places I've given 1* to in the past.... They haven't stayed in business long.  I know my stuff guys,  customer service is the most important and I've never had such bad treatment in my life at any sushi restaurant,  it was utterly disrespectful."}
{"text":"I get take out from here at least twice for the past 8 months! I can't Believe I haven't reviewed them yet every single time the food is so fresh and so good and the prices are so reasonable!! I made a mistake of going somewhere that was closer to my house recently the price was double and the quality was not half as good as Taka sushi!!  Keep up the great work guys!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place but I prefer Cynthia's Paradise over Taka. The prices are very similar and Taka has very limited selection in food and sushi.   What I really enjoyed at this place was the the spider roll. It was absolutely amazing. That is one thing that Cynthias doesn't have on their menu. The fried soft shell crab was so tender and crispy.   Their miso soup, seaweed salad was okay. Tempera shrimp was delicious and their bbq eel sushi. I really enjoyed their spicy salmon sushi, those were so yummy and better than the maki. I never really like shu mai but over here, their shu mai was delicious and juicy.   The vibe of this restaurant was low-key and intimate. It wasn't too loud and the food came pretty quickly. The ordering off of a paper menu was really old school but brought back good memories.   The servers were okay. Less interaction, didn't clear our empty plates as quickly.  Would I come here again? I don't know. I just think for the same price, I'd get better quality of food and great service at Cynthias but if I wanted a less crowded intimate setting, I would definitely come here.   Happy Eating fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"This place has gone way downhill since our last visit in 2016. Service was terrible. When we walked in the waitress pointed at a table and then ignored us for 10 minutes even though the place was empty. There is virtually no communication from wait staff. They take your order paper then come by and toss dishes at you as they are walking past. Timing in between dishes was poor.  After waiting a long time, I asked about another dish I'd ordered. Well, another ten minutes after that, the waitress comes by and slams the dish down on our table. It felt like dining in North Korea. The restaurant is looking run-down too, floors dirty, shabby. Not worth $23.95 per person!  We will never go back there."}
{"text":"Taka - the only sushi restaurant in Newmarket that can routinely treat me like I'm an inconvenience and keep me coming back for more.  I don't know what it is about this place either than simply the food is good. Okay, we're not talking about a 5 star sushi house here, but for local sushi? This places hits the spot.   The sushi is fresh, the appetizers are delicious, the less conventional items (Thai curry) are perfection, and they have deep fried ice cream and custard buns. (Which they have a 2 servings per person limitation on ... which is a good thing, cause I could easily down 6 of each of these by myself - no shame.)   My boyfriend and I have a running joke that I should ask for a bowl of rice at the same time I put in my beverage order, with any luck, maybe I'll get it by the time we order dessert.  Which brings me to my final point, and only qualm: the service. Good luck getting anyone's attention, you will ask for the same thing several times, and if you're lucky, maybe just maaaaaybe, they'll bring it to you."}
