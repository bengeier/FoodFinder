{"text":"I've now been here 5 times, and would still give this a 5 star rating. I've sampled just about all their dinner dishes except that bean/vegetarian one because I am a man and I like to eat meat. Their dinner dishes are:

Blackened Chicken: 5 stars, probably best dish on their menu
Steak: 5 stars, the steak is really really tender, even when we order it well done
Tuna: 4 stars, there isn't a lot on the sides which is my only complaint
Snapper: 5 stars, just a really unique and tasty dish. Can't decide if this one or the blackened chicken is best.

My only complain is besides the blackened chicken, they don't give you a whole lot of other stuff on the plate. It would be nice if they gave you more rice or veggies to make you feel more full. This isn't a problem with the chicken though as that is filled with a lot of rice and is probably the best tasting and best value main entree in Calgary. I just wish the other dishes came with a bit more stuff."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Calgary - Try the chimichurri steak."}
{"text":"We hoped to go to Sabroso on Valentine's but left it too late and opted to make a reservation for the following evening. We were pleasantly surprised to find they were offering a set Valentine's menu this evening as well. We were greeted immediately at the door by the hostess and as we were ushered to our window seats, but as we were about to sit I was directed aside as if being called to the principal's office. I was surprised to find I was being offered my choice of red or white rose to present to my wife. A nice surprise and nice touch!

We were fortunate to have Orlando, one of the partners, serve us this evening. As busy as he was overseeing the restaurant operations, he provided excellent service and shared his and his restaurant's history with us.  A free glass of sparkling wine was presented first. As this was a set menu we could choose from soup or salad, three appetizers, three entrees & two desserts. The meal also included a glass of wine with dinner. We chose red which I believe was a nice Argentinian and was listed first on the wine list.

We decided on the Butternut Nut Squash soup for our first course. It was delicious but was barely lukewarm. We selected two appetizers to share. The first, a skewered prawn with aji panca & soy sauce and a duck wonton dish as our second appetizer.  Both were delicious and could easily eaten more.

We had a difficult time choosing the main course. As I had read so many positive reviews for the  Chimichurri Hanger Steak, I had to try it. This dish is wonderful, full of texture & flavour due largely to the mouthwatering Chimichurri sauce. My wife opted for the Salmon (not a menu regular item) dish. We sampled each other's dish and as good as the Hanger Steak was, the Salmon won hands down! Both were however,excellent.

We enjoyed live music all during dinner which was lively but not over powering on our conversation. It was fun to watch Orlando jump in and join the guitar player/singer with complimentary bongos and other hand instruments.

The only negative on the evening was dessert. My wife ordered the churros but I wasn't asked what I wanted. Three small churros arrived along with two chocolate dipped strawberries. The churros were disappointing as they were small and over cooked. After we finished the churros I called over Orlando and I offered (tongue-in-cheek) to buy a Sabroso Classic Flan for myself. I was surprised to find a $9 charge on our bill for this supposedly free item! Neither the churros (menu price $10) or the Flan are good value and are average desserts at best. We would not order dessert in the future.

Parking is extremely limited and we had to park a block away. Overall, we had a fun time and enjoyed our food & the atmosphere very much. We do look forward to going back again soon! Our rating drops from a perfect score because of the dessert fiasco."}
{"text":"A good spot for tapas with a South American twist. The deep-fried baby squid were lightly coated in some spice and buttermilk, with a humdrum creamy dip on the side. A good sized portion with light crunch, but not too out of the ordinary flavor-wise. The chicharron was three fried slices of pork belly, served with a vinegar sauce and a balsamic reduction. Due to the varying widths and thicknesses of the slices, some bits were more like a Filipino chicharron (very crispy, light) while other bits were more like a braised porky belly (soft, dense and fatty). The best tapas was the chick peas with Swiss chard and smoked pork, which had a good contrast in textures, a distinct smokiness, and plenty of spice (but not heat). Very friendly chef and reasonably good service. At ~$12 per tapas, it's A-OK and we were pretty filled up from all that fat. Would give extra stars if the flavors were more out of the ordinary, or the presentation more refined."}
{"text":"Authentic Spanish food at its best in YYC. Great service and environment, the calamari and tuna appies were off the hook. We will be back with friends in the future!"}
{"text":"Food was really good and service was good as well. The chicken mile was spicy than I expected but still really good. I highly recommend the calamari, haven't had anything quiet like it before."}
{"text":"Well I've been back a good few times now, and Sabroso clearly also serves consistency. It's always great. The menu changes from time to time with new and interesting offerings.  The wine offerings are also a delight. 

Now that I'm thinking of it, I think I'll go there tonight. I've got that craving. Es muy bien."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is just down the road from me a bit, so I had to give it a try once I realized it was open. This space has been several restaurants and bars in the past many years, and most don't seem to last very long. It's just that little bit off of the strip that makes it seem so out-of-the-way, perhaps. With The Pint going up just a block away, it extends the 17th Ave entertainment area just that little bit farther that might help to provide the necessary clientele for Sabroso.

What will also help are the best-in-class mojitos that they serve up. Our server and bartender, Jeisson (or was it Jeissen?), told us a couple of the secrets of making a perfect mojito. I'm not going to share those secrets here, as if I tell you yahoos, it's no longer a secret. Rest assured, Jeisson uses these secrets in crafting perfect mojitos.

What makes a perfect mojito? Balance; not too sweet, and not too lime-y. Thankfully, there was no granular finish to the drink, as happens all to often when a bartender doesn't fully dissolve the sugar. Jeisson was very proud of his mojitos, and he certainly should be. I challenge you to find a better mojito anywhere in this city.

I also enjoyed a couple of very well made caipirinha. I can't say they're the best in the city, as I simply haven't ordered them in enough places (they're probably not available in many places). But it was made with authentic cachaça, and it was mighty tasty.

We ordered a couple of sharing items. The ceviche was excellent, with very tender shrimp and scallops, and plantain chips on the side. I would have preferred a little bigger portion, but the flavour was certainly fabulous. I found the beef anticucha to be a little on the tough side, though Jeisson assured me that was not typically the case. 

I'll be heading back to Sabroso frequently. I dig their space. I agree with John Gilchrist's review (google it) that it is a space very reminiscent of Mescalero. And I loved Mescalero."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing restaurant to eat at. Phenomenal service. Very friendly and professional atmosphere not to mention some of the best food I've had in a long time. Will be back for sure with more friends. I highly recommend this place to anyone in town."}
{"text":"Awesome ambiance, great food. First time there. I had the chimichurri steak. Delicious chimichurri, some of the best I've had. Also loved the Cuban style black beans and rice. The chef came ut and talked to us a couple times. Very nice and knowledgeable about the dishes he was serving. I wish they had some plátanos maduros, that would have perfected the plate for me."}
{"text":"I must've been there on an off night judging from these reviews, but phewf, man. This was a disappointing dining experience. We made a reso online, which was great! We showed up and the waiter seemed surprised to see us. He sat us, but then had a big table elsewhere and it took a long time for us to get drinks ordered. The Sangria came and it was yummy! Again, we waited a long time before he took our food order. The menu was SAD. 6 options, and all pretty bla-ze. I ordered the Chicken Mole. My partner ordered the Snapper, but the waiter said they were completely out of fish. All fish. At a Latino restaurant. So he ordered the Chicken w/ Cilantro Sauce. 

The food did come in a decent amount of time, but it was honestly the worst food I've probably ever had. Definitely the worst food I was ever expected to pay $25 per plate for. The chicken was way overcooked, flat and dry. It was chewy and flaky and almost fishy smelling. The Mole sauce dried on the chicken and I could hardly taste it. The waiter kept making sure I knew how spicy it was going to be, but it literally tasted like nothing. The vegetables were two small asparagus twigs and a few square inches of zucchini. There was a cup of white rice with no flavour on the side. Like, what? Partner felt the same way about his chicken, but the sauce seemed yummy enough for him to stomach the whole thing.

It took us then probably 45 minutes to get the waiters attention. He was super nice about it and offered me something else from the menu, but we decided to go. He docked my meal from the bill, which was nice, and he said he was short staffed. Another 20 minutes for him to come by and take our money so we could leave. Within this time, a family of 5 came in, was sat, and then ignored for so long they all up and left.

The reason this place gets two stars at all is because there was some lovely live Latin guitar music playing and the waiter was really nice, albiet swamped. It was not his fault at all. 

I won't be back. The quest for good Latino food continues..."}
{"text":"we went there for a birthday party.. staff were really friendly who provided outstanding services.. always asked if we needed anything and gave us ideas about tastes and flavors about food in the menu.. food was really good.. however little pricey. Also there was a live music at that time..and which was amazing. !"}
{"text":"We decided to try Latin American cuisine on a Saturday night.  After squeezing into our parking space, we entered the restaurant and were greeted warmly by Alejandro, the owner of Sabroso.  Alejandro is the most active restaurant owner I've seen in a long time -- he spends time conversing with customers, serving plates, and playing percussion/drums with the guitarist/singer!   Our server Orlando took our orders on his iPod touch and sent it to the kitchen right away.

Appetizers:
Calamari with avocado/wasabi mayo with lime:  cute, wonderfully fried calamari sticks with a light batter.  The mayo was a perfect match; I just wish that there was more of it!

Potatoes tortilla: potatoes, onions, cilantro in an omelette.  The vibrant dipping sauce had the right amount of spice.

Mains:
Parrilla para Dos:  the grilled hangar steak was juicy and tender, prawn skewer seasoned just right, chorizo, boneless chicken, crispy potatoes.  The sauce was so delicious that I was tempted to lick the plate clean.  It was served with a side plate of risotto, baby bok choy, squash and microgreens -- cooked to perfection.

Desserts:
Milhojas con Arequipe:  the delicate mille-feuille with caramel sauce and vanilla custard was not too cloyingly sweet.  The custard was as smooth as silk.  Mmmm....

Cinnamon Churros:  my son loved his cute little churros coated in cinnamon sugar. It came with a chocolate sauce on the side for dipping.

Fig and Cocoa Nib Bread Pudding:  hubby had this one and I took a quick nibble.  The fig and cocoa compliment one another so well that there's no need for extra sugar.  Let the ingredients speak for themselves!

Maravilloso!   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I met a girlfriend for dinner after work today and we were very impressed. One of the reasons we chose this restaurant is the huge selection of gluten free dishes on the menu as my friend can't eat gluten. Between us we had the jicama salad, the calamari, the snapper and a chicken arepa. Everything was delicious and full of flavour. The service was good, food was good and wine was good. Definitely worth a try if you are looking for something a little different."}
{"text":"The parking lot (entrance on 16th Ave) is tight, and the restaurant itself is on the small side, but large, clear windows open up the space. Our host Alejandro has a big heart: we were welcomed like family. Service is efficient -- orders are input via iPod Touch and transmitted wirelessly to the kitchen. We tried Parrillos por Dos, a platter that includes hanger steak (juicy and tender), grilled prawns on a skewer, boneless chicken, and large spicy chorizo sausage served with a side of risotto, bok choy, micro greens, and roasted potatoes. Delicioso! We'll be back."}
{"text":"This new Latin restaurant was simply delicious. The chimichurri steak and Vera snapper were flavourful and refined. It's great to have a nice restaurant within walking distance and just before 17th. The best par to the experience? The staff. The owner, servers, chef and live musicians were friendly and entertaining! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's gone. Closed down for non payment of rent for months. The location appears to be especially cursed, bring the third or 4th restaurant in that spot in 7 years. 

Too bad, they did try but the marketing was terrible and the street profile was worse. I'm sure all the construction on 14 st SW couldn't have been very helpful."}
{"text":"Great Latin food.. Probably the most authentic Latin food in Calgary... Everything was very good... The fish is fresh and all the dishes are very tasty... I would like to go back there to try the different dishes they have..."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I had in a long time. Love this intimate half a century old place. It is small but cozy, friendly and just makes you feel good being there. Basic over easy tasted like they had chickens in the back ready to go lol!  thanks!"}
