{"text":"Best sticky tofu in Toronto lol love the snacks as well"}
{"text":"There's a rich aroma of stinky tofu as you step into the shop. You will like to stay for your meal if you a fan of stinky tofu. By the way, there are only two seats at the shop. I believe it is meant to be a shop mainly for take out. At first I wanted to order the Hokkaido Cream Omurice but it's not available and so I ordered a Curry Omurice and a Boneless Chicken Cutlet. The presentation of the Curry Omurice is nicely decorated and garnished. It looks like a plant in the middle of the curry aea with the yellowish eggs and red slice of tomato. The chicken cutlet looks good too. The cutlet is big. The taste of both items is ........... SPICY!!! HOT!!! You will love these two items if you are a fan of spicy food. To me, these two items are a bit too exciting to eat but the taste is good though other than spiciness. If you are a yelper and you checked in at the restaurant, you will have a complimentary fresh tea or milk tea. So the complimentary iced drink put my fire off.   I would like to come back again and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews on their stinky tofu, we decided to give it a try. We left super satisfied, they did not disappoint at all! We ordered the mala stinky tofu, in which the spicy sauce comes on the side. Although the sauce was not that spicy, the aroma of the stinky tofu was strong. We could smell it as our order was being made. After finishing the bag, we kept craving more, so it's safe to say it's one of the best stinky tofu we have tried in this area!"}
{"text":"This place has only two seats, so more for take out. But the stinky tofu should be eaten immediately because you don't want it to get soggy.   The stinky tofu was amazing. Eating the stinky tofu here gives me memories of walking around Causeway Bay in Hong Kong. I think this is one of the best stinky tofu in Toronto.  The squid balls were good, grilled shrimps were not bad. The popcorn chicken was okay, there are better ones around the area. I find it not dry enough.   The Hokkaido cream omurice was not bad. Except that I think when buying take out the rice was not wrapped inside the egg, and a little too much rice. The minced pork rice (new item) not on the menu was good. The minced pork was very flavourful and the rice have sauce. The egg was a small egg and nicely marinated. Everything went well together. Having said that as a stinky tofu lover, this little hidden gem is worth checking out just for the tofu itself! Will be back again."}
{"text":"I love their stinky tofu! Quite a bit of wait but it's worth it! Ordered the peppered tofu instead of the mala tofu, EVERY. SINGLE. BITE. is stinky!!!!!"}
{"text":"I usually don't eat Taiwanese food in Canada as it's never been replicated well. However, I decided to give it a try based on the good reviews. Although not all the items on their menu are authentic (e.g., the seasoning and size of stinky tofu are quite different from what I had in Taiwan), I do like some of the modifications the owner made. I never like oyster vermicelli, substituting with shrimp was a great idea and I really enjoyed it. Japanese Omrice tastes very Taiwanese and reminds me of my time in Taipei. The place is definitely worth five stars because it is way better than Green Grotto, Wiki Star, and other places that claim to sell Taiwanese snacks."}
{"text":"The stinky tofu is very authentic, exactly like how it tasted in Taiwan night market. One tip is to eat it in house because the tofu is not as crispy outside if order take out. The noodle soup base is so dense and thick like other Japanese Ramen soup base, but a different take into the flavor (sesame)."}
