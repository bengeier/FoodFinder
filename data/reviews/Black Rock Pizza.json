{"text":"I've eaten here once and got take out once.  The salad was good and fresh and I really liked the pizza.  It a very thin crust, which I love and a good sauce.  It's a good place to bring kids too. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Large space. Would be great for a party. Pizza very reminiscent of Village Inn pizza-thin crunchy crust with nice amount of cheese and Italian sausage to make it chewy, tasty and filling. Gourmet pizza it is not. It was a Thursday night so I didn't expect a crowd, but I wasn't sure our waiter was on his A game. I hope they are able to fill the place up on weekends."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Thin crust, lots of cheese (mix of mozzarella and provolone), and great toppings on the Hawaiian. It was nice finding somewhere that serves Canadian Bacon instead of ham on the Hawaiian pizza. The breadsticks were awesome--it was like a hunk of focaccia bread.  

Nice atmosphere. Enjoyed hearing a band play. Who knew such a great place was tucked away in the Lincoln square mall!"}
{"text":"Love this place, the buffalo chicken pizza is awesome...thin crust, plenty of blue cheese and hot sauce...perfection! Friends have had the sandwiches and salads and all reports were positive. Nice atmosphere, much nicer than most pizza places. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Sadly, this place is closed. I think it was the location, I'm not sure how much of a crowd the lincoln square mall draws."}
{"text":"Very good food! I work in Lincoln Square Mall and it's nice to see good places to eat or shop at joing the Lincoln Square Mall, I have lunch there often and the pizza is great! The Chorizo stuffed Mushrooms are to die for! The space is large so it would be a fun place to host a get together at. I would recommend their pizza to anyone!"}
{"text":"We love Black Rock!!! This is THE best place to get pizza!! We became fans when they were over on Race St. Now that they have more room it's even better!!! They also have live music, real pinball tables, and support local charities. My kind of place!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a winner.  Pizza has elements of Monical's and Papa Del's...but brings it's own game to the table.  Recommend!"}
