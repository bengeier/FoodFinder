{"text":"Quick search on Yelp for good Hakka Food yielded this restaurant. Other reviewers are right - this place is in a really sketchy neighbourhood but the food is good!  We went many of the suggested dishes on Yelp - - started with the Chicken Pakoras. Okay. These were amazing. Not a ton of breading - just right. And the flavours were soooo yum! I could eat this all by themselves all day! I've had many versions of Chicken Pakoras and this is hands down the best one. We also went the Crispy Beef as everyone seems to suggest. It was good! Gingery, sesamey and nicely done with some onions. Wouldn't be Hakka dinner if we didn't try their Chilli Chicken with gravy which was also good! Could have been a touch spicier but it was good nonetheless.  We had the Hakka noodles which was also good. The shrimps were a bit small - but there was too much going on with other ingredients to miss them too much.   Service was great - friendly service on the phone and the food was fresh. We'll be back to try other dishes soon!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and 2 times they said they didn't have crispy beef and asked if I meant chili beef even know I have had the crispy beef before ..."}
{"text":"This place looks kind of sketchy from the outside but the food speaks for itself. Every dish I ordered came out nice and hot. The server was very friendly and helpful in picking out dishes. Our food arrived in good time. I took off a star because I find the dishes and cutlery should have been more cleaner. Otherwise it's great food at a budget price. Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Most pathetic and disgusting customer service, not only gave me a wrong order, but also denied to pay back and the server she was yelling on top of her voice. I have been a regular customer and i am totally furious and disappointed."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there today based on the reviews and we were NOT disappointed. We got spices and pepper shrimp, spicy wings, manchurian chicken fried rice, and manchurian fish. Everything was absolutely delicious! This is our new favorite place. The people in there are super nice and helpful as well. Must go!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here or picked up from here often.   A friend introduced me to the restaurant.  She's been friends with the owners for years.  I would never have entered otherwise.  The location and appearance is iffy but inside is very clean.  First I started going down their specials menu but when I reached the General Tsao chicken I was hooked.  Portions are very generous and the staff very friendly.  Sometimes I share a meal with a friend as the portions are that large.  Great value for great food"}
{"text":"Deeeeelish, fast and friendly staff.  I was in a pickle and needed a quick bite. They were open and tried them out. Large portions, flavourful, and fast. Check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Possibly the best hakka restaurant in Toronto. Hakka is a fusion of chinese cuisine originated in India and invented by Chinese immigrants. The food there is a bit greasy, spicy, and hot, but that is what Hakka is all about. Try their manchurian chicken and hakka noodles if you are there. Other than that, they also do some typical dish famous in Canada... such as General Tso, kung pao etc, but I would recommend you to be brave and order Hakka, The waiters are very polite and the place is clean (even the washroom at basement)."}
{"text":"We chose this place based on the existing reviews and we were not disappointed!!!  Anyone who goes there MUST order the Crispy Beef. Honest to god it is AMAZING. So flavourful, tender and perfectly sauced. Not the least bit chewy or rubbery. We never order beef with any Asian dishes but Lotus Garden is the exception.   Singapore noodles were as expected and yummy. Still not quite sure about the Manchurian Chicken Chow Mein it wasn't our favourite but we were glad to try it.   We live around the corner and ordered delivery. It took just under an hour, which we were prepared for so that was fine. Cash only for delivery.   It's so nice to have found a (Indian) Chinese food place that uses fresh ingredients and is not overly greasy. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"If you love Hakka there's no better spot than this..We get take out here at least once a week and everything we've tried is delicious..quality fresh ingredients and so full of flavour. I could review every dish individually but it would take too long, they are ALL so good! The soups are not to be missed! Edward the chef is friendly and very accommodating. We couldn't be happier we've discovered this place..all thanks to the reviews below."}
{"text":"We were curious about Hakka cuisine but had never tried it.  After having spent several hours reading reviews of Hakka restaurants in the GTA we chose this one.  Wow!  this place is great!  The food was so fresh and flavourful,  very yummy.   The staff was awesome, friendly and helpful - which was a bonus since we really didn't know what to order.   Do not let the exterior dissuade you!  The food is genuinely fresh, fresh, fresh!     We had the hot and sour soup, the Manchurian Vegetable balls, the Manchurian Chow Mein, Crispy beef, Chili Chicken, and the Szechuan eggplant.   Each dish was better than the last!   Eat in, take out - whichever you like, the food is awesome!!  Can't wait to eat the left overs tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"Clean and great little spot. Awesome customer service as well. I visit here about twice a month,  Suggestion: Chicken pakora"}
{"text":"I can't understand where all the great reviews for this place came from. I had their Hot and Sour soup, Crispy Beef, Chili Chicken, Manchurian Fish, and Thai Fried Rice. Other than the soup which was good and the fish which was adequate the rest were not even close to some of the other Hakka restaurants out there like Spadina Garden or Faley that leave you feeling satisfied and pleased after most any dish you order. The rice was almost inedible and most everything seemed like it had been sitting out for a day before they used it to make the food. Quite stale. I wouldn't recommend this place to an enemy."}
{"text":"This is my go to dinner take out since it's super close and never disappoints.   Great prices, large quantity, tasty and flavourful, and friendly service. Would strongly recommend any/all of their chili dishes.   Only complaint is the kitchen service. It usually takes at least 40 minutes for an order for us. Had 1 bad experience with a super long wait time, but that was only once awhile back and they threw in egg rolls. Also, they usually have only 1 person at the front of the house taking calls, waitering, cashing out, etc. so it can get slow when it's busy. Would recommend delivery if possible."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Crispy Beef is a must. So good! Service is great, very attentive and accommodating. I've heard their delivery leaves something to be desired but have no personal experience with that."}
{"text":"50 minute wait was unacceptable. I get that you had two big parties of people dining in but we put our order in before they arrived and were told it would only take 30 minutes. It was our fault for taking a walk for our \"30 minute\" wait, I guess they forgot about us...unacceptable.  The food once we got it was very hot and in large serving sizes. The crispy beef wasn't the best but the Singapore noodles were tasty. We also had the general Tao chicken and chilli fish. Tasty but have had better!   We might go back but would probably explore other Hakka restaurants first. The seating area is small and outdated but if you want food fast, dine-in & opt out of take-out!"}
{"text":"The Manchurian Chicken on rice is top notch, and one of the best in Toronto.  Looking to try the Crispy Ginger Beef as that seems to be a crowd favourite."}
{"text":"we live in the area but always had to travel to Frederik in Scarborough for descent Hakka. we ordered the crispy beef, chicken pakora and other Hakka staples. we were very pleasantly surprised! the food was fresh, tasty and a great blend of spice and heat. the price was reasonable. strongly recommend this family owned eatery if Hakka is your craving."}
{"text":"Your typical Hakka food choices but very reasonably priced. I ordered ahead of time but had to wait an additional 20 minutes when I arrived to pick up my food as it wasn't ready. Nevertheless, pretty good food, all day specials (includes the weekends), and good prices. Can't go wrong with that combination!"}
{"text":"I called and my take out order of Manchurian chicken was ready in 15 minutes. so fast! enjoyed the meaty pieces of chicken, tasty gravy and the spice was perfect. Great for take out :-)"}
{"text":"Beef and broccoli is yummy, Chili chicken (with rice or noodles) is delicious. This is defintly near the top of my go to list if I need some quick hakka food..."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!  It's tucked away in a small strip mall. The food was fantastic! Went for dinner with my wife and we loved the food.  Great taste; fresh; huge quantity; and not greasy.  Lots of variety on the menu.  Friendly staff.  We'll be going back again."}
{"text":"What can I say about lotus garden? One of the very few Hakka style resturants in the east end. It's one of my faves in the area! It's family owned so the food has always been tasty and well portioned! I love the general tsao chicken and the schezuan beef!"}
{"text":"The food is tasty. I ordered the chicken soup & ginger chicken. Tasty but I didnt like the atomsphere :("}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has so many great reviews. The food is okay but nothing great, it's not the best I've had and not close to the Indian Hakka Style.   Ambience was so-so and not worth the long drive.  Brown girl says, \" -_- hmm\""}
{"text":"First of all, I'd like to say that the Lotus Garden had the best hot and sour soup I've had in a while. We also ordered the chilli chicken and the Manchurian Veg Fried Rice which were totally yummy. Second, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the veggies used in the soup + other dishes were actually fresh -- not the often used frozen peas/carrots/whatever that so many restaurants feel are just what the doctor ordered.  The food was absolutely amazing - very flavourfull and good quality.  The portions were gianormous -- their small hot and sour is more than enough for two people -- and the prices are laughably low.   Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Very nice hakka food. Ordered crispy beef, hakka fried noodles and they were amazing. Definitely coming back. They have delivery service too."}
{"text":"Unfortunately when I came again after such a great experience, the noodles looked no where close to how it looked in my previous review. It lacked spice and flavor, and really tasted like steamed vegetables with some carbs. We tried to get more spices on it after, but it still wasn't the same taste and was kind of disappointing. We were told that the management has changed from last time, but because of this experience, I cannot stand by the review that I gave before :("}
{"text":"I hate to do this because it means advertising this hidden gem to more ppl and potentially diluting their cooking down the line but I feel guilty not telling ppl how good this hakka is.  It's the best I've ever had and it's the cheapest I've ever paid.  Unbelievable.  The quantities are insane, like they're trying to go out of business.  They must be growing their own meat and veggies because I don't know how they can give so much *good* *quality* food for so cheap.  Everything was top notch.  Even had little twists on dishes I'm pretty familiar with that really made them stand out from other spots.  Little tanginess where you don't expect it, little crispiness where you don't expect it.    The pakoras must be the best on the whole planet.  Honestly, I can't imagine how you'd make a better pakora.  Crispy, fluffy, super flavourful, super flavourful, not overpowering flavour either, like an etherially infused spice flavour.  Really delightful stuff.  Eggplant.... they actually slightly batter and fry the eggplant before cooking it down so there's a hint of crisp to it and when you cut into the eggplant, it's not overcooked to the core like you'd expect with the dish.  The inside is still white but the whole dish is flavourful, fantastic. Crispy beef was among the best I've had.... next time I MUST have fish. Next time, thankfully, will be tonight.  Maybe I'll see you there!  Honestly, if you're at all interested in hakka, this is the one!  They just replaced my go to hakka spot.  Sorry, go to hakka spot.  There's a new go to hakka spot in town..."}
{"text":"Ridiculously good hakka cuisine. We tried the hakka noodles and chili chicken. Both were flavorful with the right amount of spice. One of those dinners where you hit the full point but keep eating because it is just too good to stop."}
{"text":"Sooo good! The Masala chicken and Jeera beef were both incredible. It's as if you've taken all the delicious flavors of Indian food and then added the positive qualities of a good Chinese stir fry. Boom, that's hakka food. The hakka style rice noodles were also quite delicious. One thing to beware of though is that they only take cash or debit and their machine doesn't read American debit cards."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Nine years in Toronto and I've never eaten Chinese food in Chinatown. I've also never tried Hakka style Chinese food before.  That being said, this is the best Chinese food I've had in this country. The Hot and Sour Soup is the best I've EVER had. Manchurian Egg Fried Rice was delicious. First time trying Crispy Beef and it was also delicious. They made a mistake with my American Vegetable Chop Suey and gave me chicken and shrimp instead of veggie, but it was still really good, I just picked out the shrimps. The General Tao chicken was a bit gristly and should have been spicier, but had good flavor.  The young man who took my order and served my takeout bags was beyond sweet, and the restaurant itself was very clean and smelled good.  As someone else said, don't be put off by the crazy neighborhood (someone was outside in the street screaming about \"get off my street!\"), the food more than made up for it. I'm moving more central, but will definitely make the trip out now and then to try other items."}
{"text":"It was one of nights where the bf & I couldn't decide where to eat dinner tonight...#firstworldproblem lol so we definitely went on yelp for some help. We saw a couple of Hakka chinese restaurants around our area & the first one that got our attention was LOTUS GARDEN!  We ordered manchuran fried rice, garlic chicken & crispy beef. We wanted chinese brocolli w/ garlic (Gai Lan) which was not on the menu but they quickly accommodated to our request right away ^_^   As the food came out, there was a bit of a mix up w/ another table. The new server had given us the Thai fried rice & another chicken dish. We were quite confused but indulged in it anyway. The owner then was quick to respond to the error & made changes. We ended up keeping the dishes as well as it was so delicious. She sincerely apologized & made sure we got the 2  mistaken dishes for free & on the house.  As the food came out, it looked as good as it tasted. Crispy beef was nicely seasoned & definitely had a nice crunch effect to it which I loved ! The Thai fried rice...OMG never had I ever ! Tasted any fried rice like the one here @ Lotus Garden. It was sweet & savory & had a nice touch of little pieces of crispy  chicken & pineapple *2 thumbs up*. In addition, the Chinese brocolli was also delicious.  Funny thing about my experience here, was as the bf was packing up our left overs....I tried to race him in getting as much food on my plate before he packed everything up. IT WAS THAT GOOD!  I can honestly say that this is the best Hakka chinese food I've ever tried & believe me...I was never a fan of Hakka Chinese food until now. *round of applause* to LOTUS GARDEN for exceeding my expectation"}
{"text":"When I came here in January, I absolutely loved the food but was so disappointed when I came back here in April. Apparently the owners changed and the food just doesn't taste the same anymore! Our hakka style schezuan noodles had no flavor or spice. The lady was nice enough to add some more sauce to it, but unfortunately they just turned out to be a yellow, sour mess. If you had asked me months ago I would've recommended this place without a doubt but now it's just gone down the drain unfortunately."}
{"text":"At first I waited half an hour because they hadn't opened yet, but let me say it was    worth the wait ! I would've had waited two hours just to have this chicken pakora , not spicy but so good , AMAZINGLY GOOD!!   The area looks shady but that's the great part, u wouldn't really expect this place to be good, with potholes in the parking lot but whoever doesn't try just because they see a place that doesn't look good, THEY ARE MISTAKEN! With one waitress that's getting a job done she doesn't have time to talk, and neither will u, because u can't talk when your face is stuffed ! We were a party of 3 and we ordered 4 plates which were more then enough!      I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ,   Order the chicken pakora for sure"}
{"text":"Very very good Indian Chinese - Calcutta style. Best tangra chicken in Toronto. Excellent Hakka noodles. Don't allow yourself to be turned off by the strip-mall-war-zone neighbourhood ethos or by the odd characters in the general vicinity. Let your tastebuds be your compass as you makka for the hakka."}
{"text":"We ordered take outs Chicken pakora- flavourful, right amount of batter and the portion was pretty big! Crispy beef - sweet and gingery taste Chili chicken - delicious, just wished they gave a bit more.. Hakka stir fried noodles - brought me right back to my Hakka Chinese roots  Location - a tad far but worth the drive Definitely recommend and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had the privilege of having their red soya noodle before the owners sold their business.   One of the hidden Hakka places that served some very authentic Indian Hakka food. It's sad to see them go.   I haven't tried their food by the new owners yet."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite restaurant in Toronto. Quality is up there. Very cheap meets huge portions, something I cannot say is typical for either Chinese or Indian."}
{"text":"The Haka style noodles are a must. We also had a beef with veggie stir fry that was good. We heard people there say the Crispy Beef is excellent so we will try that next time.   Portions are generous. Great value. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"This place has by far the best customer service of any chinese restaurant in Toronto. Their food is quite delicious and their prices are affordable. I used to go to Yueh Tung which has slightly better food but their server and prices aren't as good as Lotus Garden. This place is awesome."}
{"text":"Based on the other glittering reviews, we gave this a try last night. Yep, it really is that good. Everything was better than usual for this kind of fare. I like the variety in the menu. Everything was very well prepared and delivered on time and hot. We will definitely order from these guys again."}
{"text":"Great food. Fantastic bang for buck. Not the greatest interior but not different then other hole in the walls. Not the greatest place for a date or first impressions but if your looking for good Hakka halal food for cheap price and good customer service you won't find too many better ones in the city."}
{"text":"Just finished a great dinner.  Eat here if you like spicy. The place is very casual and does not appear too clean but that should  be overlooked.  The crispy beef is a must.  Very flavorful.  Ginger chicken was spicy with a huge amount of ginger, yummy. Manchurian chicken Chow Mein was very good, if again, you like spicy.  The stir fried veggies were not good as the cook used too much soy sauce (overly salty). We took home more then half the food.  A enjoyable dinner for another night."}
{"text":"Family's been recommending me this place for years but today's my first time and honestly I'm so impressed . Right from chilly chicken to sweet noodle to the soup ,I loved it all !!"}
{"text":"The last time I was here I just thought it was an off day because the food didn't taste quite the same at all. Not that it was bad, but it didn't have the same unique taste. I ordered take out again today and it was even worse! Everything was super sweet. None of the dishes tasted the same as they used to AT ALL. Must be new owners. Such a disappointment as this used to be the #1 take out place for us :( I'm bummed."}
{"text":"The decor is very basic, but the food is delicious and freshly-prepared.  The serving sizes for the Manchurian Vegetable Balls (like a pakora) was enormous, which was a problem because they were so delicious I ate too many before the main dishes arrived!  We really enjoyed the seasoning of all the dishes.  Very reasonable prices.  Definitely our new go-to Hakka spot in Scarborough (which has a lot of Hakka spots!)"}
{"text":"Very underrated. Quite well variety. Hakka flavor is authentic. Service and food is very good. Can be a bit pricey.  They also offer halal which makes it open for my parents.   Their soups are good. The signature items are must try."}
{"text":"Outrageously good. I was having a lazy night and got the veggie pakora and the hakka shrimp noodles for takeout.  Not going to lie. I ate 4 pakora on the way home... so tasty. Literally so good. The hakka noodles were very good too. The pakora stole the show because they were crunchy and tasty with a little spice.  Very large portions and a very cute clean space.  All the positive reviews are true and I would definitely suggest visiting. I will likely be back for this crispy beef that everyone is raving over... beef is rarely my first choice at Chinese but they did so well on all the other dishes that I'm actually excited to try it."}
{"text":"Solid Hakka food at very good price. Portions wet big and great for sharing. My kids like wonton soup (what kid doesn't?). I ordered a medium bowl expecting the same stuff you get at every all-you-can-eat buffet. I was pleasantly surprised. Nice Fresh veggies and very good wontons.   Chilli chicken was good, not great. Beef and veggies was very nice as was the mixed chow mien.   The dining area is super basic. Don't expect fancy service or a romantic ambiance.   But for great value, this will be my go to place for takeout near the Beaches end of toronto where the Chinese food is terrible."}
{"text":"So sorry to say that since the the owners changed (about 10 days ago) this restaurant has gone drastically downhill.  None of the items are the same as the previous owners recipes. Everything was over salty. Very low grade meat with too much batter. Nothing was even remotely spicy. Will never go back to this place. So disappointing."}
{"text":"Update (April 2018):  I've been a regular here for years.  New owners and the food definitely was not up to par on my first couple of visits.  My most recent visit will absolutely be the last.  1) Food cannot be cooked in five minutes and is obviously sitting there aging while it waits for someone to order it.  This does nothing to enhance it.  2) Meat is burned/dried out. The taste is very bland and even a large portion of house hot sauce poured all over the food cannot salvage.  3) Meat, as mentioned by others, is low-quality and is a very small portion by ratio (should I be grateful for this?).  4) The dining area used to look very clean.  Now, in general, but particularly the floor, looks dirty.  5) Finding not one but two hairs in my food was enough to call it.  6) While waiting, I noticed from the little that can be seen through the doors to the kitchen, that there was a large pile of meat sitting out unrefrigerated, next to a cutting board where someone was chopping vegetables.  Definitely they will fail a health inspection.  Very, very sad to have the original business gone and replaced by this."}
{"text":"Very very tasty food, very good service by the waiter. She was thoughtful, patient, understanding, gave great advice and her personal opinion on how to go about ordering what and very accurate about what the food was like.  The restaurant is very clean inside and furnished well. The portions are huge, I was filled with one dish. The atmosphere was great.   All in all, a lovely experience I'd love to replicate in the future. Do recommend. Fair warning, they were a tab bit slow in bringing out the food at 1PM on a Saturday but it was blistering hot so I think we were the first dishes they made. Not sure how that translates to the rest of the day or week."}
{"text":"We ordered vegetarian manchurian pakoras, manchurian noodles, chop suey, chicken in black bean sauce, a soup and schechuan fried rice for take out. Had read great reviews about lotus garden and the food did not disappoint. Manchurian was crisp on the outside and super soft on the inside. They had packed the gravy separately (sensibly). The noodles and rice were hot to taste and red in color -- reminiscent of the Hakka cuisine back home. The chicken in black bean sauce was the highlight though. All in all, well worth the 1/2 hr drive. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"When word spread that the owners of Lotus Garden sold their business, I was simultaneously worried and intrigued. Would the new management team be able to carry on the legacy of the best hakka restaurant in the GTA? Would they bring anything new to the table?  We finally made the time to go back on a Sunday evening in May. There's still a lot of good here: portion sizes are still excellent, the chicken pakora remains a really tasty option, the prices have only gone ever-so-slightly up ($6.50 specials instead of $5.99, and that might just reflect the higher minimum wage), and the customer service - while different - is still charming in it's own strange way.   Ultimately, however, I am not sure it's worth the out-of-way drive anymore.  CHICKEN PAKORA: still good, still tasty, and largely retained that perfect crunch (maybe a little bit off). 4.5/5  CRISPY BEEF: went from a very unique style to a more tangy, traditional look. It went from legendary to average at best. 2.5/5  VEGGIE PAKORA: meh. No crunch. 3/5  MANCHURIAN FISH: decent?  CUSTOMER SERVICE: I mean, the new guy is just hollering left right and centre, and that's kind of funny. Not the same calm, serene, pleasant experience as before, but not necessarily bad either.  All in all, I'd pop by if I were in the area and hungry - but ultimately, I think I have to find another dish here that doesn't make me wistful for what used to be."}
{"text":"A friend of mine is Hakka, and so I trust his judgement when he says that a place has good food. When he described it, he said its like his mom's cooking, which is about as good of a review as you can get. We went with a group of people and have been coming back ever since. The food is so good! The shrimp balls are worth the trip alone! The chicken pakora is amazing, as is the crispy beef. The corn soup is also really, really tasty and we always start our meal with that. The prices are really reasonable given the portion size and the quality of the food. The staff are super friendly and more than willing to make recommendations. I was just there last night and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I would like to give this a 4.5, but since we don't have .5's yet, I'm just going to round up. Lotus Garden is located in a small strip mall on Danforth and Warden and isn't very noticeable. I thought with the great reviews that it'd be bustling at dinnertime so we decided to get there just before 7. To my surprise, the place was empty and we were the only ones eating at the restaurant. If you are driving there, do mind the potholes. The parking lot looks rough.  We ordered the chicken pakora, Manchurian egg fried rice, crispy beef, and chili chicken with gravy. The waitress chuckled and said we must be new to Lotus Garden because our list is what all the newcomers order. We wondered if that meant these dishes aren't their best dishes, but I don't mind coming again to try other things. Anyways, back to the dishes!  The best thing on the table was definitely the chicken pakora. It was crispy on the outside and the dark meat so was juicy on the inside. (Side story: I'm a huge dark meat chicken lover, so much so that the owner of a shawarma joint in Mississauga used to call me Dark Meat because he didn't know my name. Sorry....I digressed again)  The crispy beef was delicious was well and had the right amount of ginger to give the sweet sauce on the crispy beef a kick.  The chili chicken was good, but I expected more heat from the chili chicken. The chicken is also fried before it's tossed in the gravy. The chili chicken gravy goes well with the fried rice.   None of these dishes were very spicy. Having said that, both my friend and I can take heat. The portions are generous and my friend and I split the leftovers to pack as lunch the next day. I think the total came to less than 40 dollars which is great value in my opinion. I will definitely be back to sample the other pakoras!"}
{"text":"It was good for a east end hakka place! i tried manchurian fried rice with chicken, it was pretty good!"}
{"text":"This was our first time having legit Indian-influenced Chinese food, so we weren't too sure what to expect. Since everyone seemed to be raving about the crispy beef, we went with that, even though I also wanted to try the chili chicken. It was definitely the right choice. There is nothing subtle about the dish; the presentation, aroma, and taste are all very much in your face as soon as it comes out. It's stir-fried in a manner reminiscent of westernized Chinese meat dishes (like General Tso's), with a crispy and sweet exterior and tender interior. The choice of vegetables and sesame topping go well together, while there are some spices to give it a bit of a kick. We also had a combination chow mein to go with it. That was also quite tasty with a lot of noodles, though I couldn't tell much of the fusion influence there."}
{"text":"Food is ALWAYS fantastic. Solid tasting hakka food that will keep you coming back often. As a very pleasant surprise, the customer service is an added bonus in these types of places. (Great lunch specials too)"}
{"text":"It taste okay.. the ratio of meat and noodles is so off, you get soooo much noodles and barely enough meat. I don't find it has any taste just over all very oily."}
{"text":"My favourite Hakka restaurant in the GTA! We have known this family for several years and one of the cooks, is one of the first original Hakka chefs in the city. His son has now opened this restaurant and is cooking alongside his father. We stop by this restaurant on a monthly basis. Their food is authentic and delicious, the perfect mixture of Chinese and Indian flavours. It's unique and has a bit more spice than traditional Chinese food, which is something I love. Their service is warm and friendly and it's a family run restaurant, which I find are becoming more and more rare. Stop by for some delicious pakora (chicken and shrimp), chilli chicken (dry), chow mein and soups (lung fung soup)!"}
{"text":"This will be our new destination for Hakka - better than others I've reviewed!  What distinguishes the place here is the freshness and quality of the ingredients.  We especially like the bombay beef, which was very tender along with being flavourful and the Manchurian egg drop soup, loaded with tasty veggies, but all we ordered were winners.  The place itself is extremely plain and is located in an unpropossessing strip mall (currently with a burnt-out) storefront in an obscure area.  Don't let that put you off.  The service was excellent and the manager was very friendly, pleasant and obviously appreciated the repeat business of one member of our party who introduced me to this place.  Also, the prices are a bargain and the portions are huge."}
{"text":"Just ordered the Thai soup and chili chicken for take-out.  You should specify on the \"daily or weekend special\" because I was charged their regular menu for the chili chicken.  I personally prefer the crispy beef (had this when I dined in) over the chili chicken.  I also prefer the Thai soup over the hot and sour soup since it was more flavourful.  I dined in once (last month) and their atmosphere is very casual.  I don't eat Hakka food often so can't compare it to another place.  Their daily/weekend special is worth your bucks."}
{"text":"We went on a friday night and it was packed and a lot of people kept coming in. We had the Thai Soup, Chili Chicken, Manchurian Chicken Fried Rice and the Crispy Beef. They have great specials every day and I'm so jealous some people get to eat here all the the time. We got the medium Thai Soup and it comfortably fed 3 adults and 2 children. The Chili Chicken was good but not spicy at all. The fried rice was really good and so was the Crispy Beef. It was a tad rubbery and a little too sweet but I've never had Crispy Beef before so I wouldn't know. I would definitely order all of those things again. If you're american just know that none of your cards will work so make sure to bring cash."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food delivery I've had in Toronto. In fact, I just went on a 1 week trip to Hong Kong, and other than a few outstanding meals there, this restaurant was just as good as any of the restaurants I tried there.   We had the following  Hot & Sour Soup - Show stopper here. If you go this restaurant, order this. I'm not even a big fan of hot & sour soup, but I was told to order this anyway. I don't know what they put in this thing but it was the best hot & sour soup I've ever had.   Hakka Chicken Chowmein - Another incredibly tasty dish. Make sure you order it! A little bit more spicy and effervescent than your traditional cheese noodle dish.   Chilli Chicken - Spicy but also very good!  Manchurian Beef - A little bland compared to the other selections, but I still enjoyed it   It took almost an hour and a half to get to our door, but we quickly forgot about it after we tasted how good the food was.   Food for 6 people including tax, tip and delivery was only $60, and we had leftovers for the next day. At this price point, you can't get much better!"}
{"text":"I had the sweet and sour chicken, and I asked for fried rice instead of steamed rice... didn't happen. I walked into the place and it was busy. The one gentlemen in front of me had a mix up with his order, and one sir was unpleasantly waiting for his order. So I told the cashier working that I wasn't in a hurry. When I brought my food home I was hoping they didn't mess up my order, and they did. Steamed rice instead of fried, it didn't really taste like chicken but, \"how was I to tell\".  All in all I would not go here again, I have had better Chinese food."}
{"text":"It's not often you find a halal restaurant with such great dishes. We had the chili chicken, crispy beef, manchurian fried rice with chicken, and garlic honey wings.   Impressive amount of food for a great price. The dishes are well balanced with all flavors. Not overly sweet or salty. Just fantastic.  The restaurant is a little difficult to find if you're not from the area, but I highly recommend taking the drive over to eat here"}
{"text":"Best Indian Chinese food ever had in Toronto. It's a nice little place with good customer service. Everyone should try the Veg/Chicken Pakora.."}
{"text":"Food was fresh, hot and spicy.  Each dish was unique and delicious. So much variety.  And the food is also halal.  For such a small restaurant they are very professional and well mannered. Have been here at least three times and will return for more."}
{"text":"Sorry but I failed to understand why this restaurant has such high rating. My friend and I were looking for late night food in the area and this restaurant was open until 11pm.   We ordered vegetarian chow mein and honey crispy chicken. We asked the server if the honey crispy chicken was spicy or not. She said it's not. When the food arrived, turns out it was slightly spicy (but I couldn't eat any spicy food at all). While the chow mein tasted great, the spicy chicken was the deal breaker. I also want to point out that the colour of honey crispy chicken dish was really dark (almost like black) and not very appetizing. There's a nice big glass of water to cool down the heat, but don't expect them to refill your glass of water."}
{"text":"Food is really good!! Went there to eat a couple of months ago...did have to wait a long time for the food like 45 mins (they were backed up) but it was worth it. When the food finally came my husband and I were amazed! Delicious! Chili chicken was fantastic! Overall the food was really really good!!  Just had it the other day but did take out this time. Food was ready in half hour for pick up =) and again everything was delicious!  Can't wait to have their food again. Oh and it's a halal restaurant for those who eat halal."}
{"text":"This is one of those times where your mom's lessons about not judging a book by its cover reigns true. A little restaurant in a totally divey strip mall (seriously, it's always on the news), but the food is downright amazing. Try the crispy beef it's unbelievable. The hakka fried noodles were also great, not spicy enough but delicious flavors. A good array of appetizers and different dishes. I've had take out multiple times and it's always been fresh, reasonably priced and fully eaten."}
{"text":"At least where I'm from in the states, Chinese takeaway has a reputation for being greasy and inauthentic. But I was pleasantly surprised by my experience at Lotus Garden.  The restaurant is small and seems mostly designed for take-out, but there are a few tables if you want to eat in. The owners were charming and fun to talk with. The woman at the order counter was extremely friendly and made sure I got everything I'd need: my order, any utensils, extra sauces, etc.  Based on previous reviews, I ordered the crispy beef and the chicken pakora. I wasn't a huge fan of the crispy beef. I didn't realize it would be so saucy and sweet. There wasn't any spice or kick to it, which I prefer. The chicken pakora, on the other hand, was amazing. It was spicy, juicy, and tender. Also, all of the food was prepared very quickly - maybe 5 minutes from when I ordered until when I got my food.  They have a lot of menu items, so I'll probably be back to try something else. You should stop by, too, if you want some quick and easy Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Based on Yelp reviews I decided to give Lotus Garden a try.  The Crispy Beef was tasty but very sweet, it could have used some chillies and ginger to make it less one note.  The Chili Chicken was disappointing, it had some nice heat going on but the sauce was heavy on the onions and salt.  Yueh Tung and Chilli Chicken House in Mississauga are still my favourite versions of this dish.  The mixed fried rice was also a miss with a burnt taste and frozen mixed veggies and a few baby shrimp and tiny pieces of chicken here and there.  I wanted to love it, but I won't be back.  Sad face.    My search for Crispy Beef to replace Yen Ching's continues."}
{"text":"Took quite a long time for our meal to arrive (30 min+). However, the food was really tasty. We ordered 1 chili chicken meal searved with rice and the amount was perfect for the two of us. You'll have a hard time finding a better meal for 2 for ~$7.5 in Toronto.   If you don't mind the waiting time, and are looking for \"Indian Hakka\", this is a good place. Would've definitely given a five star if not for the long wait."}
{"text":"The lady who seated us was nice. First thing I did was run (down the long stairs) to the washroom. The washroom was clean. Me and my friend ordered chicken fried rice and chilli beef with gravy (without sesame seeds cause I'm allergic). The chilli beef had a looot of onions. If you like onions you will love this dish. The dish tasted good and SPICY no doubt. The fried rice on the other hand seemed like it was already cooked before we got there because the chilli was so steaming hot compared to the rice. But it was good. I was a bit disappointed only because the ratings here were so good! Found this place on yelp and we were in the area. Maybe I'd go back but order something else on the menu. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken chow mein, crispy beef and chicken fried rice for delivery. The food was enough for dinner for my gf and I and some leftover for brunch! They only deliver after 7pm and depending on how busy they are, expect your food to arrive at least 30-45minutes after ordering.   The food was decent for the price. Everything added up to $25.50. For four meals, that's better than eating fast food."}
{"text":"Great Hakka restaurant! Service was extremely friendly and fast. Would definitely recommend if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"From Pittsburgh area and wanted to get some Hakka from nearby where we were staying.   Food was decent for portions but I must admit that the flavor of the food wasn't very exciting at all. However, The restaurant was kept clean and organized. In my opinion it's not the best Hakka in the area but defiantly not the worst either, worth a try."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered dinner for two. The food was delicious, and came in large portion."}
{"text":"Cheap good food. When I'm craving chili chicken , I especially like to come here for take out. Dry, no gravy. Also love their masala chicken! Atmosphere isn't so great but their cheap prices make up for it."}
{"text":"Awesome Hakka spot in the east end. Everything I've had here is on point. Favs include Chili Chicken (obviously, what is Hakka without this dish), Masala Chicken and Stir Fried Rice Noodles.   Also, bonus points for having a Chicken Wonton soup. You don't find that at many places, usually pork/beef/shrimp or some combination of those.  They also get quite busy during lunch/dinner hours - so call about 30 minutes before you plan for pickup."}
{"text":"This was as true to Hakka food back in Tangra in Calcutta. The place looks outdated but don't be fooled, the food is amazing. It's not your run of the mill Hakka joint, their menu is full of real authentic dishes.   My favourite dishes among them are the red noodles (true Hakka staple you will find in Tangra) and the Shrimp Pakoras that remind me of Ha Gao (dim sum dish)."}
{"text":"Great place to be. Food is amazing, friendly staff. Not expensive at all. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The sweet and sour chicken is the best in the city. It's the perfect flavour with the right amount of sauce.   I would say the crispy beef is better at Fred's uptown, but I know I'm alone in my family for thinking that!   The people running it are really nice and we usually don't wait too long for our food. It's great how much food you get with your order so it's definitely a cost effective dinner + leftovers! We found one order of anything plus rice is good for two people. Add some variety with a second dish and take the leftovers home!   Also I think now I recall the rice sizes are huge. Whatever you were thinking, go one size smaller!"}
