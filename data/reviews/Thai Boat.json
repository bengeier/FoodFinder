{"text":"I love Thai boat, they have the best spring rolls I've ever had any where. Beef yellow curry is delicious and pad see yu is amazing with coconut rice. It's the one place I never get disappointed in the service or food. The people there are so nice and they all work together so efficiently. 

It's one of the few restaurants I've ever been to that all staff serve you and you're not stuck waiting for your server or trying to remember what they look like when you need something."}
{"text":"if you're looking for good thai food this isn't the place. Green curry was watery, basil stir fry dish was more Chinese than thai, and the papaya salad had romaine in it."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant!  After spending 3 weeks in Thailand and eating the best food ever- we were sceptical if finding anything comparable in Calgary-- however Thai Boat is as close as it gets for us.

Service has always been ok for us-- we can usually get a table (with 2 kids) right away.  They are fairly accomodating to the kids-- who usually chow down on the chicken and corn patties while we wait for the rest of our dinner.  

The soups are delicious and well priced to start off your meal.  
Will always go back here!"}
{"text":"Generally a good place; one of the better overall places to dine in the further northeast. I believe their curries are their strongest point."}
{"text":"Had good food for lunch.. We chose the combo 1 and it served for 2 people... Worth for the money... Will prefer to go again...
Good ambience, good serving time, good taste...
One thing I felt missing was the spice level which other Thai restaurants usually have..."}
{"text":"This is a really good place. Not truly authentic Thai but suuuuper tasty!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Worst PadThai I have ever had. It was just noodles in sauce. Small portion as well. Just all around sloppy, expected a lot more based on the whole \"Authentic\" theme they are going with..."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed this restaurant. It has Thai decorations, but not over the top, and lots of humorous sayings on plaques to keep us amused. The owners seem to have a sense of humour and aren't afraid to be unique, which is a nice change in this day and age. The service and food has always been good in the past and was again this time too. 
A friend and I met here, ordered the Papaya Salad with medium spice, the Lemon Chicken appetizer and the Swimming Rama (who could resist a name like that!) with coconut rice.
It was lovely to have a gluten-free \"breaded\" item but it didn't quite live up to my expectations, it was a bit past crunchy and more into just hard. It was fine when I dipped it into the peanut sauce that was part of the Swimming Rama though. And I did quite like the lemon sauce so not all was lost. 
The Papaya salad was something I've not had before, I enjoyed it, but can't say if it was the way it was supposed to be or not really. 
For dessert we each had the Mango/coconut rice and it was just fine. 
We managed a couple of pots of Thai tea as well. It was an herbal tea, naturally sweet, with a subtle flavour of its own. You can buy boxes of it to take home, which I might just do next time I want to add to my tea collection. 
It looks like they have a buffet option as well, but I didn't pay attention to it as buffets are generally a mine field for gf folk. 
I have to remember to pop in for lunch more often when I am doing business at this end of the city, the parking is free, the prices are reasonable, the food tasty and the service quick.  :-)"}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times and the last meal I had there was much better than I remember it to be.

We were a group of 6 adults and 2 kids.  This is not really a restaurant to bring your little ones in the evening.  The ambient is fairly quiet so if you're not comfortable with your kids being loud (if they are loud) then it's not the place for you.

This last meal we ordered:

= Massaman Curry
= Green Curry
= Pad Thai
= Black Pepper Sauce Prawns
= Bok Choy and Prawns in a Coconut Sauce
= Deep fried fish fillets with sweet and spicy sauce

The Pad Thai was really good.  Slightly different from most of the Pad Thais I have tried before with a slight hint of spice.  I am not usually a curry person but really enjoyed the Green Curry with beef.  All other dishes were really tasty as well.

One item on the menu that I have not seen anywhere else before is Thai Iced Tea with Cognac.  I could smell the Cognac but the flavour of the alcohol blended very well with the Iced Tea, so much so I couldn't really taste the Cognac.  Worth a try!

Since I was pleasantly surprised with the better quality food, I will probably head back there in the near future."}
{"text":"Thai Boat

Felt like Thai food last night and decided to visit the Thai Boat. It's located in a strip mall in the NE across from the White Spot and Joey's.  The ambience, is okay for a strip mall environment, but nothing special.  You certainly don't need to put on your tuxedo and strapless dress for this location. Service is okay if you like being served by unsmiling teenage Asian children...

I thought the menu selection was okay, although a little unprofessionally put together.  It was awkward to read, and looked like it had been printed by a teenager. The wine menu was very limited and was hard to read as well. While I'm not a beer drinker, I chose a Chang Thai beer. Not a bad flavour with the spicy and aromatic food.

We chose three different dishes; beef chicken and prawns, together with rice and noodle side dishes. To my astonishment, the food arrived within five minutes of placing our orders.  I felt uneasy wondering how that was possible.  In all cases, we thought the food was watery and not as creamy and rich as we have previously experienced it at other Thai restaurants. 

Anyway, from the time we got there, to the time we left, it took 35 minutes....no asking whether we wanted deserts or not, no asking whether we wanted anything else, no more drinks or not....just the bill handed to us. And then I had to personally present myself to the bar counter in order to pay for the food on the chip machine.

I'm a strong supporter of \"ethnic\" restaurants, but I hate it when the ungracious kids, of hard working and well-meaning immigrants, don't care a damn about their attitude and service that they are offering to their paying customers.

I'm sorry, I wont go back there, and recommend that you don't waste your time going there as well..."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and I've had some great meals in some great Thai restaurants. Alas, this wasn't one of them. The ingredients that you should taste - the things that are the essence of Thai food - lemongrass, basil, kaffir limes, coconut milk, galangal, - are all missing or muted. What you're left with is closer to the chinese food you'd find in an all-you-can-eat buffet. Can't fault the service or the decor though, which were both fine. The plates, serving dishes and cutlery have to be seen - they're fabulous. With a different chef this place could be much better."}
{"text":"This was our go-to place. The staff are as awesome as always, but sadly the food is not what we remember. Lots of veggies and meat for sure, but the curry flavours need a refresh. The Tom Yum soup also needs some work. Sad day."}
{"text":"\"We make your spicy dreams come true\"

I kid you not. It is written on the front page of their menu. They have several levels of spiciness to \"make your spicy dreams come true\".

The Satay appetizer is pretty good. For entrees, I've had the penang curry w/shrimp (good), the duck curry (not enough duck), and the #40 noodle dish (very good). The curries were good, but even at the spiciest level, it wasn't spicy enough for me when I'm in the mood for spicy. The #40 noodle dish was pretty good, and you don't need to denote the spicy level. It had a nice kick to it. It is a bit oily though. All dishes are pretty filling.

As for drinks, both the coconut juice and the thai tea are good.

Service is a bit off. Sometimes it takes a while, or sometimes they forget. I've even had change given to me for someone else's bill when I just gave a credit card to pay my bill.

Not the best thai, but pretty good for NE area for lunch.

+ good noodles
+ good drinks
+ good for groups
- odd service"}
{"text":"Thai Boat has been a go to place for lunch for me & my coworkers for years.  Thai Boat marries scrumptious Thai food with super quick service.  Personally, I avoid the lunch plates b/c I think they run a bit on the smallish side.  My friends and I pick a few dishes from the a la carte menu and then eat family style.  Everyone gets a bit of each so everyone wins.  Some of our favorites are the Massaman beef, Panang prawn and Sweet & Sour Chicken (it's not fried like the Chinese version).  Thai Boat also makes a mean Thai tea which is super sweet and creamy.

Wednesday is buffet day at Thai Boat so I avoid it like the plague.  It is very popular so it's very busy.  If that's your thing, definitely check it out but we much prefer the more laid back rest of the week."}
{"text":"If I could give this a no star I would! First off the dishes were such small portions, second the dishes had maybe a couple of pieces of meat in it so when you order a bunch of food, you'll probably get a single portion of meat in it! And last the service was just beyond rude. The waitress wasn't helpful in the food selection and she didn't even bother asking us if we needed the bill. She came by to ask if we were done and then walked away! Took us about ten minutes to get her attention so we can pay and leave. There's so many other places to go to for Thai food so don't even bother with this one. This isn't my first time here, when I went couple of years ago, it was such a great place but now quality of food and service has definitely gone down."}
{"text":"If you like Thai food, you like this place. The decor is kind of authentic, the food is excellent. I had the green curry and all the veggis in there were super fresh. Very pleasant service."}
{"text":"I've never really went for Thai food before so I can't really tell what is authentic and what is not -- generally I find a lot of the Far East foods similar in style and taste because countries are so close together and there are peoples of every country living in other countries not their own.

Decided to try out Thai Boat with two of my friends yesterday just to get a taste of what it was like. We arrived around 7pm the place wasn't packed or anything.

Decor was more the cliche bamboo/wood/stick hut type style which I honestly don't mind. I really like when restaurants take creativity a little further and decide to decorate by how or what they sell inside their restaurants.

First thing we did was order their new Thai beer called Chang. I'm not a connoisseur when it comes to beer but I do love all beers so this Thai beer was no exception. Definitely quenched my thirst for the meals to come.

We started off with some Tom Yum soup, it is a kind of sweet & sour kind of soup that includes mushrooms, tomatoes, celery and shrimp placed in a elephant shaped bowl (cool!).

I tried out the Coconut Rice which tasted actually fantastic I'm definitely a fan. My first plate was the coconut rice with a stir-fry mixture of breaded fish, onions, green peppers, red peppers in some sort of sauce.

My second plate was the coconut rice paired up with some of the beef stir-fry which essentially had the same ingredients. I was playing kind of safe with what I was eating since it was the first time venturing there.

My last plate was the coconut rice that I covered in the rich and tasty broth of the Curry Chicken bowl we had ordered. I usually don't even like curry but I definitely enjoyed this dish the most. Nice chunks of chicken with onions and potatoes.

I also picked at the Papaya Salad which was tasty I thought as well. My friend thought it was pretty spicy but I found it to be the perfect amount that you're not ripping your lips off your face.

I'd definitely come back here and try this place out again!"}
{"text":"2.5 to a 3 star for this one. Barely a 3 as the service here really has a lot to be desired.
We decided to dine in, we had only had take-out from here one time before. The food is pretty good - when you get it. We were left with our closed menus at our table for just too long before being able to order. The restaurant was not very busy.
I did like the presentation/plates BUT if you are hungry, you may be disappointed with the portion sizes.
The Pad Thai noodles were cooked perfectly, not too soft and was spiced very hot as I had requested.
The yellow curry was OK, was really missing some more coconut milk. It was definitely edible but lacking flavor. The chicken in the curry was very good.
We left kinda hungry, however we felt that the prices were decent and would consider again for a take-out order but never as a dining option.

Most disappointing - slow, impersonal service and portion sizes
Pluses - parking not an issue, clean, cute eatery and food - good."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! We had Green Curry, Cashew and Basil Chicken stir fry and coconut riceSaw your restaurant featurette on Shaw Cable TV."}
{"text":"Food: 2.5/5
Service: 3/5
Overall experience: 3/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

I've had my fair share of Thai food in Calgary, and Thai Boat sadly disappoints. The food was just \"okay\" where a few of the dishes' flavours were too mild or bland. On the plus side, Thai Boat is fairly spacious, allowing large groups to come in and share various dishes family style.

My first visit to Thai Boat was with a group of about 10 people at 7pm on a weekend. Although the restaurant was full with other groups around us, the food came out surprisingly fast. Our server was patient and attended to us frequently, re-filling our water glasses. The decor is a little drab, with a Thai motif of bamboo/wood and mini-models of Thai temples scattered around. Nothing to get excited about. 

I was able to try a bit of everything from their menu including appetizers, soups, salads, curries, stir fries, noodles, and rice. Curries were about $10 with your choice of beef, pork or chicken, and came in a decent size where 2-3 people can share (depending on how much you eat). They provided us with a plentiful amount of coconut rice, stored in a metal tin container like you would see at a Chinese restaurant. The rice was fluffy and had a delicious coconut aroma that paired nicely with the curries. 

I ordered their Tom Yum soup which had a nice balance of sweet and sour flavours. It had 3-4 pieces of large succulent prawns, mushrooms, and other herbs. I happened to order mine extra spicy and they definitely did not hold back on the Thai chilies! Despite breaking a sweat, I enjoyed it!

For appetizers we tried their calamari which was heavily battered and oily (definitely do not get)!! We also tried their 'beef jerky' appetizer which was dried beef strips that still had a soft chew to it and was accompanied by a yummy sauce. For our main we ordered the Pad Thai which came in a very small portion (barely enough for 2 people). The noodles were overly sweet and gooey. I enjoyed their sweet and sour pork stir fry which had a well-balanced sweet and sour flavour with lots of onions, bell peppers, and sauteed meat.

We tried most of the curries on their menu including their Green Curry with Chicken and Red Curry with Duck. The curries consisted of a fair amount of onions, red and green bell peppers, and meat. Majority of the curries were very watery and only had a mild coconut taste with no spice. Although many people in our group didn't eat spicy food, I still expected the Thai curry to have some heat but would be mellowed out by the coconut milk. The meat within each curry dish was overcooked and tough to eat. 

Overall, I wouldn't recommend Thai Boat for 'good' Thai food. The food was forgettable and the prices does not justify the portion and quality of some of their dishes."}
{"text":"Wed lunch $12.99 

I went for the $12.99 Lunch Buffet  on Wednesday only.  It was my first time dining at Thai Boat.  

On the Buffet menu:
Coconut Rice
S&S Spicy Chicken Wings
Green Curry Chicken 
Pork & Stir fried mixed Veggies
Beef Veggie 
Seafood stir fry 

I was surprised there was no  PAD THAI... like hello!!!!!!!!! 

I wasn't that happy with it...  

I was happy with their dessert - Fried Banana and coconut ice cream  BUT for $4.00 for 1 banana and a scoop of ice cream :( ehhhhhhhhhh   It probably cost 30 cents for that banana lol"}
{"text":"Thai Boat is a great little place.  If you're in the middle of this largely industrial part of Calgary and you'd like to get a bite to eat, it's probably one of the better options available to you."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the worst restaurant experiences we have ever had. We had gone for dinner to celebrate my birthday. There were 6 adults and two children in our party. When we got there around 7 pm the place had a number of people there and while it was busy, it was not packed.

After we were seated, the server arrived to take our drink order. We gave our drink order and, at the same time, also ordered dinner, skipping appetizers, as it was quite late already for dinner. The server seemed quite put-out because we did not order appetizers.

After a wait of 20 minutes, a different served dropped off one small dish of Pad Thai at our table. We waited for a bit expecting the rest of our order, consisting of roughly 8 other dishes, along with coconut rice, would arrive shortly but it didn't. When I asked one of the servers where the rest of our order was, our server, who we learned later was the son of the owner, came over and told us it was coming and that we, a party of eight, should start eating the small Pad Thai dish! 

We were incredulous. I asked him what the rationale of bringing one dish at a time to the table was, particularly, when many of the dishes are combined together for dinner? At this, he responded, \"well, we have to take care of other tables too\"! As if the fact that there were other customers in his restaurant was our fault for which we were to be penalized. This person's rude demeanor surprised all of us. 

Shortly after that, the rest of the food arrived, but one of our dishes was missing. When I asked the server about it he told me in the same rude manner as before, that I had not ordered it. I pointed out to him that I had ordered two of each dish that was in our order and received two of each, except for the one dish I was speaking of. Of that dish there was only one. Instead of addressing the issue, he continued to argue that I had ordered only one, and in a manner which lead one of the members in my party to wonder, \"is he on drugs?\"

When I asked to speak with the manager about his belligerent and obnoxious behavior, the server walked away. I then approached another server and she informed me that the person serving us was the manager there. I then went back to our server and asked him to give me the name and phone number of the owner of the restaurant but he refused to do so! I then approached another employee of the restaurant. Her response to me was that I would have to deal with our server and that there was no one else who could help me! Persisting in my attempts to get the name and number of the owner of the restaurant, I approached yet another server. This person informed me that the person who was serving us, was in fact, the owner's son! 

Lol. I couldn't believe it. Never in my dining  experience have I ever encountered such juvenile, uncivilized and uncouth behavior than I and my party did that night.

In the end, we all paid the bill and left wowing never to return and also committing to warn others to choose a better place to eat than this one with meager portions, substandard food and rude and obnoxious owners."}
{"text":"Google had it at 4 stars... way off.  Should have looked at yelp instead.
Had spring rolls which were meh.  Tom yam soup, thai see woo noodles, beef satay sticks similar.  Nothing was really hot temperature wise which gave us pause.  Beef satay was chewy.  Shrimp was borderline not fresh.  
I would go only if nothing else is available.  We were looking for post 9:00pm snack so we chose this one.
Service however was very friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai I've found in Calgary. Can't say enough good things about this place!"}
{"text":"If someone told me that at the edge of a strip mall would be a Thai place, with all of my favourite dishes, I wouldn't have believed them... and I certainly wouldn't believe the food would be any good. But I'm sure glad I was wrong!

The red curry duck wowed me. Wasn't a big fan of the pineapple bits, but the spice was right, and the duck was juicy. The pad thai was decent although, I thought for the price, it was a little small. It could have been more flavourful, then again, it was sitting next to a strong dish. 

The service is attentive and kind and the space itself, well has \"boat\" like features and bamboo galore. And, if you're anything like me, you'll get a kick out of the happy faces and zen like sayings on the menu."}
{"text":"Food and service was great.i just can't put 5 stars as the food serving is too small. My toddler can finish it and will still ask for a burger. Price is decent but come on, you can throw an extra scoop on your servings."}
{"text":"Was in Calgary for work so we decided to come here since it was close-ish to our hotel.

I got the thai iced coffee photographed here and it was delicious! My coworker got the thai iced tea and said the same.

I got some pad thai with chicken. It was really good. It had some good spice to it which I liked. My coworker is in Canada much more often than me and commented that most of the Thai places were not big on the spice and the fact that this one was was noteworthy!

Excellent place! Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food here is aweful, but it's a nice, clean place with a personality hence the two stars. The food won't kill you, but you wont enjoy it either. It's not really thai food, not even Americanized thai. Just some pseudo-Asian mix that doesn't taste good. Too much sugar, too much peanut sauce, too little real flavor."}
{"text":"Good food! Kid friendly and service was good. Portion sizes of plates are good and would recommend two dishes per person and coconut rice very tasty."}
{"text":"I have rarely tasted better, more authentic Thai Food that these guys. Their Beef Rice in Chilli Paste or the Chicken Cashew Rice in Chilli Paste - I think #64 & #65 on the menu."}
{"text":"Kids activities in the area.  Driven by this place a zillion times. Curiosity got the best of me and I decided to drop in while kid one was doing her sports for a quick bite to satisfy an unusual rumble in the tummy.  I knew it would be take-out so I was hoping it wouldn't be too busy since it was after all a Friday evening.  

Wishes were granted (good for me, not them?) as it was pretty quiet.  I was able to walk in, be greeted, they seated me while I reviewed the menu, place my order, pay and be out within ten minutes.  Superb. 

Headed back to the activity and happily ate my chicken with thai basil/veggie stir-fry....accompanied by coconut rice.  Even though I only ate half of the meal, it satisfied the rumble.  It was good, not great, but good enough that I would return to sit down and try more of their dishes.  Friendly peeps and service were also winners that evening."}
{"text":"Got the red curry and pad Thai for take out. Not that good. Pad Thai was flavourless and didn't have good ingredients. Red curry didn't have a sweet coconut milk taste. Plenty spicy put not familiar tasting to other red curries I've had."}
{"text":"Having visited Thailand many times, this is not authentic Thai food. It's more like Chinese food that tried to imitate Thai. The food was awful. It was very salty and had a flavor that certainly was not what is typically is supposed to taste. We had the basil chili beef and lemongrass chicken off their lunch menu. The portion is small to average but didn't matter, didn't desire to have more. The 2 dishes came to almost $30 including tax and was not worth that. The one star is for the nice waitress. The decor is just cheap dusty souvenirs thrown together; has no ambience. I would give this restaurant a miss. The food just isn't good."}
{"text":"If ever there's a quadrant in this city that's jam packed with awesome eats, it's the Northeast.  And the Thai Boat is no exception.

My very first visit to the Thai Boat was an apres-work shindig with my coworkers.  It was the first meeting of our unofficial social club.  Five of us made our way over there and cozied ourselves into one of the booths.  I don't remember exactly what we ordered then, but I do remember it being so good I had go back.  That was five years ago.

With many visits to their Wednesday lunch buffet (make sure you go before 1:30 or you'll miss it), and just weekday and weekend meals with friends, the Thai Boat remains one of my favourites.  On my most recent visit, we ordered a red curry, some pad thai and coconut rice... but chances are if you think it sounds good, it's going to be good."}
{"text":"Thai Boat is located in a strip mall on 32 Avenue in the NE.  I'd say the parking is OK.  It's typical strip mall parking where people park like idiots and take up two spaces.  If only they moved a couple inches I would be able to park there kind of parking.

It was one of my co-workers birthday and she suggested Thai boat for lunch, so we headed that way.  When we arrived, we got seated right away.  There is a lot of things going on with the environment, lots of random decorations, but cute.  We ordered some thai tea..the cups are unique... small green cups with big handles, I think the handles are an elephant or something.

We looked at the menu, and decided to pick a few dishes to share.  We started off with springrolls.  They were alright, really hot..definitley fresh out of the fryer.  Then we went with 4 dishes:  Nua Narm Tok (Spicy beef salad), Sweet n Sour Chicken (on the menu it says beef but we substituted the beef with chicken),  Curry beef dish, and Pad Thai with prawns.  We also each had a side of the coconut rice.  The food came out pretty fast,  the first thing I did notice was the dishes appeared to be small.  But we dug in.

I must admit, the dishes may appear small but they can fill you up!  I absolutley loved the Curry beef dish...there was a spice to it but not overpowering.  Some onions, potatoes and green peppers added.  Its REALLY good on the rice.  The Sweet n Sour Chicken was meh...plain tasting with some veggies in, the sauce seemed too runny.  The spicy beef dish was good...spicy but good!  And lastly the Pad Thai...In my humble opinion, I expected more.  The taste was plain, the prawns were nice but I wish there was more flavor!

All in all, Yes.  I would go back to Thai boat.  The prices are decent, the service is OK, and the food comes out fast.  Some dishes can be VERY tasty but I guess you have to choose the right ones!"}
{"text":"2.75 STARS 

My group and I were looking for dinner nearby our hotel and opted for Asian food rather than American food (since we had American food for lunch). Originally we were planning to go to White Elephant Thai, but realized that they only took cash whole we only had credit card. On the way we passed by Thai Boat and decided to come here instead despite the lower reviews. 

Service was pretty good. We were promptly greeted, served water (gave us a pitcher too), and served us quickly. 

Menu had many options with a variety of cheesy quotes sprinkled within. We opted for the typical \"safe\" Thai food options: the chicken Pad Thai, chicken satay, and hot pot.

Chicken Pad Thai: Definitely not the orange, sweet Pad Thai that I'm used to. Their version was more salty, flavored with fish sauce and was more like stir fried noodles to me. We asked for this dish to be a little spicier and they did just that! Spice levels here are high so when you ask for spicy, they'll deliver on this. Dish was okay, not what I was expected so maybe that's why I was disappointed with it. 

Chicken Satay: Salty and comes covered in peanut sauce already. The chicken is a bit on the smaller end but it was very hard to mask the saltiness of the dish.

Hot Pot: When we said \"hot pot\" we were expecting the Tom Yum hot pot soup that most Thai places refer to it as. Instead we received a dish similar to a stir fried clay pot of beef w/ stir fried veggies.  

Overall, +1 for service, +1 for the food coming out quickly, +0.75 for spice of the Pad Thai. The food really wasn't what I expected of typical Thai cuisine and seemed more Chinese to me so that may be the reason why I wasn't too impressed with the place. The portions are a little small if you are coming in with a party that is hungry but if I had cash I would probably choose White Elephant."}
{"text":"Great business lunch quickly served.The food is good at a very fair price. Great selection of food to appease your selective taste requests."}
{"text":"Wanted to give this place a better rating but the chicken pad Thai I ordered was unacceptable. The chicken was sour and rotten I think totally rancid. The Tom Yum soup was great but the rancid chicken completely ruined the meal. They took it off the bill but the one bite I ate made me sick for three days. When we told the staff about it she offered to re make it with the same chicken!"}
{"text":"Thai Boat has unique decor and serving dishes, which I really like.  I've never had a bad meal here, either.  The lunch buffet  is good and everything that is meant to have spice certainly has it and gets your blood pumping.  I love the green curry with chicken as well as the Pad Thai.  The menu is slightly bizarre but once you figure out what you want, you're good to go.  It's entertaining, really.  The placement of the restrooms is a little awkward because occasionally you have to squeeze past the staff, but that's a minor detail.  There tends to be enough parking and service is fast.  It's not a place I'd consider to be good for dining because of the quick service, but it's great for lunch or dinner when you don't want to spend a bunch of time in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Nothing bad, but nothing to write home about. Service was fast, bathrooms were very clean."}
{"text":"Got take out and it was ready fast. Picked up the Tom Kha soup with was very fragrant and flavourful. I wished I'd ordered a larger size!
Also got Angels Kiss, ground chicken and small shrimp in a coconut lemongrass broth with steamed rice. It was also very nice and had plenty for a lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Good portions (not too much) for lunch. Designed to be ordered for individuals. Unfortunately I've never tried this place for dinner. I doubt it would be bad, but the lunch experience is certainly good."}
{"text":"Me and the hubs had a little business in the area and finished just before noon. Hubby ate there before and figured he'd give it a shot. We had the little one in tow, so we had to eat and run, so the buffet seemed like the best and fastest option. 
And hey, when you have a little squirt with short attention spans, sometimes the buffet is the best way to go. 

It wasn't stellar by any means, but I give them an extra star because they didn't charge a plate for the 2 year old and I appreciate that. 
Even though we got a booth, sorry, but that seating was uncomfortable. 

I would definitely give this restaurant another shot but I would order off the menu before I would eat buffet."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch with 8 other people.  Getting a reservation was not a problem.

Their Wednesday lunch buffet for $12.99 has gone downhill.  On the menu was just regular rice (not even coconut rice), chicken wings, chicken stir fry, beef stir fry, pork stir fry and seafood & veggie stir fry...... uh... No pad thai?  No dessert?  The selection was not worth the $12.99.

To top it all off, at the end of the meal the server comes and asks if we wanted separate bills.  We asked for separate bills, then she says the gratuity would be tacked on automatically if we chose separate bills. Huh?  That's never happened before, where a restaurant tacks on a 15% gratuity if we ask for separate bills.  Let alone a buffet where we had to serve ourselves.

I wasn't happy and it will take quite a bit of persuasion to go back there.

P.S.  I had a really bad case of the upset stomach after eating there.  A few others did as well."}

If I am in the area again, I wouldn't doubt going there again!!.. I really liked this place!!"}
{"text":"O-M-G.  These people do NOT play with spicy.  I ordered medium spicy and I teared up continuously throughout the meal.  Whew. 

Despite the amazingly vast menu, I settled on beef and veggies.  I wanted something simple, but, if it were another day, I would be all about the great stuff they had on the menu -- coconut rice, mango curry, lychee dishes. 

The waitress was nice, but, as the restaurant was practically empty and I was sitting there crying from the spiciness, she could have refilled the water a little more.  Or just given me a pitcher.  Whichever.  

Note: They do not take AMEX.  Blah."}
{"text":"Pretty good authentic Thai food.  Prices are reasonable.

We ordered the following:

- Stuffed Chicken Wings with tangy sauce - great appetizer
- Shrimp Red Curry - Very, very good - needs a little more spice but goes so well with coconut rice.  I really like the freshly cut zucchini and red and green peppers in the curry.
- Swimming Rama - we had the chicken cury and bok choy with crushed peanuts - not too bad
- Fish dish with some vege
- Pork with asparagus

Coconut rice 

Will definitely go back to try other dishes at Thai Boat!

There's also a lunch buffet on Wednesdays for $12.99.  Have to try that some day."}
{"text":"I love this place!! It's family style dining (many smaller dishes for sharing) the menu is great lots of options but the best part are all the names and fonts it really utilized Microsoft word fonts on that!! The service is usually really great. The real champ here is the food it's always hot and the flavours are fantastic I'd eat here all the time if I could!"}
{"text":"This place was sort of a default lunch location for our travelling office gang. When in doubt whether to drive to a food court at Sundridge mall or get something 5% more decent we were like: \"Maybe Thai Boat?\"

And it was not bad that place. Rather timid prices, abundant portions, but in my humble opinion - nothing to love or tell the stories about. Just some good Thai food for the lunch. Never any stomach trouble afterwards, so I assume the kitchen to be clean enough.

Service was kwappy though, always making us wait and frequently requiring to build a queue directly to the counter, because the waitress was sooo busy doing something else instead of bringing us a bill.

Worked as a lunch destination, though, no big deal."}
{"text":"I give it 5 stars...heres why

They have been open for more than a decade now.

The decor takes you to Thailand.

The chef is Thai.

The sauces....are all authentic and they don't cheap out.

Their cutleries and plates are all matching and really high quality.

I've tried their lunch buffet years ago and it used to be like 9.99 and recently when I went the price didn't go up as much...$12.99

Considering the inflation...thats not bad price for buffet lunch.

The spices they put make the food so good. Gotta have coconut rice....its priced mote than white rice but you get about 2 servings in a fancy container.

Thai food is known for its spiciness and coconuts. If you like these 2 things...this is the best Thai place to go to..."}
