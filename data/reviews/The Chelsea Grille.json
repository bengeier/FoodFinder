{"text":"Food is above average. Alcohol prices are at or beyond level of Hoffstodt's. The ambiance is stuffy and leans old. Entrees took awhile to present themselves, a recurring theme other reviewers mention as well. Soups were average. Nothing screamed \"fresh\" or \"very unique\" or \"old world hits the nail on the head\". I wouldn't avoid Chelsea Grille but I wouldn't seek them out. Didn't make the regular Oakmont rotation.  Like a mediocre boyfriend, they didn't do anything wrong but they also didn't do anything particularly right. The Chelsea Grille will please your grandparents. You tell people it was pretty good to you but you end up eating at Carnivores and Hoffstodt's all the time."}
{"text":"There were 7 of us and Gary was our server. He was great! We had the Ahi tuna dinner, ravioli dinner, Alfredo, and St. Joseph pasta, fish sandwich, kids cheeseburger and a kids hot dog. Everything was fabulous, we took half our food home for the next day, the fish sandwich was so huge! I would definitely eat here again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I'd went here with a Party yesterday and it was the first time in years I've been there. The table ordered a seared tuna app which was pretty decent. It came with wasabi, ginger, and toasted bread. I liked how the items went together and was pleasantly surprised as for whatever reason, seared tuna usually never tastes as good as I hope it would. In this case, I was happy. The table also got an eggplant app. It had an egg batter, shrimp, a creme, and it was laid over a bed of Frank's hot sauce. The plate itself was big and could easily be an entree. I was skeptical, but enjoyed the contrasts in flavors. The egg batter is something I don't see much outside of this area, and it sort of sent me back to my childhood which was nice. For main, I ordered the NY Strip. It came with these red potatoes that were surprisingly good. They had some crisp on them and seasoning that really made them stick out to me. The steak had a very nice sear on it, but it was overlooked for my liking (I'm a rare to medium rare fan). The bread they brought out was a very nice ciabatta and I personally ate a bread loaf. I'm very low maintenance in all parts of my life except a few, bread is one of them.  I'd like to give them 3.5 stars in all truth. I'm very happy to pay top dollar for a good steak. I'm not one to mind going to a place like Morton's if the steak is great. While mine was good, I expect it to be cooked to my liking if I'm paying almost $30 for a NY strip, or at least be close (it was between medium and medium well). I'm about to head to Eleven which likely means steak again (I'm in vacation, this isn't a lifestyle), and I'm sure that I'll be dropping $20 more for a steak, but I'm also sure it'll taste amazing."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food, a bonus star for the honesty of the waiter.  I ordered a NY Strip steak - cooked just the way I requested it.  Tasty - which it better be for $28.95 (one of the pricier entrees).  Sauteed mushrooms on top were an extra $3 and were also quite good.  Side of green beans was a little soggy/limp and a little sad looking as the gb arrived on their own plate.  Tasted fine - I'm guessing out of a can though.  House salad included dried cranberries, candied walnuts, field greens, red onion, cucumber, cherry tomato, and more.  Fantastic.  One of the best restaurant side salads I've had.  I went with balsamic vinaigrette which was a little oily, but tasty.  Other companions who had the house salad also enjoyed.  One had the Caesar and thought it was under-seasoned.  As for the other entrees, my companions were not as thrilled with the food.  Main issue was they thought it was under-seasoned/ a little bland.  Most entrees come with two sides - you get to choose from salad, soup, potato (white cheddar mashed, baked, fries, redskin+), pasta (penne with marinara) or vegetable (last night it was broccoli or green beans).  Most entrees between $14-20.  Waiter was excellent.  Told us they didn't make their own desserts, but that they were fine for what they were (cheesecake, etc.)  We passed.  They do make a cookie which arrives with the bill."}
{"text":"Great lunch had a fabulous risotto cake with shrimp, WOW!  Great service, nice place."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed by the food. Staff was friendly and professional and the atmosphere was nice with a decent wine selection. I had the chicken avocado wasabi salad, which was literally 4oz of grilled chicken over spring greens. It had no substance or flavor, the dressing was very mild and I guess the chef also tossed the lettuce  with dressing prior to serving it and it tasted like they also spritzed it with both oil and vinegar because I occasionally had a bite where I was wondering if the lettuce was bad. The waiter went back to the kitchen and grabbed dressing because he thought the salad had nothing on it lol.  My friend had the calamari pasta, I tasted the calamari which obviously comes in frozen because it was rubber. Another waitress walked by an offered is each a lemon Italian cookie at the end of out meal which was good, not too over powering. I visit Pittsburgh occasionally and my friends and I try a new restaurant each time. I honestly wouldn't go back based on the blandness of food."}
{"text":"Some of the best fries I've ever had in a sit-down restaurant. The burgers are pretty good as well. I've never actually had anything else of theirs; for some reason, whenever I'm in Oakmont, I crave burgers. I'll also say the place is a touch snooty-feeling, but that's also Oakmont for you. When you're done here, pop over to the Oakmont Bakery for some crazygood cupcakes. Epically delicious."}
{"text":"Food was yummy. Not a place to go if you have food allergies because most foods are pre-prepared so little flexibility . Won't return for that reason."}
{"text":"Five of us for dinner and everyone had a great meal.       The house salad that came with the entrees was way above average with different types of fresh lettuce, veggies dried cranberries, candied walnuts and the homemade raspberry vinaigrette dressing was delicious. The manhattan style seafood chowder was very good with lots of chunky veggies, chopped clams and white fish. Our meals were chicken parmigiana, chicken saltimbocca (instead of veal, accommodated by request), Australian baby lamb chops (done perfectly--medium rare, slightly charred exterior), sole francaise and one of us had the eggplant and shrimp mornay appetizer as their entree which was perfect. I tasted them all and each one was delicious.  Service (Pete) was spot-on. Friendly and attentive. Happy to make a recommendation.  Topped off the meal with still warm house made cookies offered compliments of the house. And not to shortchange the cookies -- those cranberry white chocolate chip gems were almost worth the trip by themselves!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on Saturday for lunch.  The seafood chowder was really good.  Shrimp clams, fish and I believe scallops.   Deep rich seafood taste with a perfect consistency.   Wish I would have ordered a bowl not a cup.  Typical salad but with candied pecans and cranberries.  I personally didn't like the ranch dressing.  I think it was too much mayo or no butter milk.  Lacked the tang.  Cuban sandwich was fantastic.  Freshly roasted pork and ham.  A little light on the meat but at the price $8.99 a fair deal.  Tasty fries.  My wife tore up the vegetable panini.  Great selection of veggies and the spinach was very very good.  Great job. We will be back."}
{"text":"Wife and I had dinner here before the Candlebox show at the Oaks.  I can literally not think of one thing that I didn't love about our dinner.  I dunno .... maybe it's because it was date night with my lovely girl, or maybe it's because the atmosphere was inviting and comfortable, the appetizers were delicious, and the entrees were outstanding.  Even the iced tea was awesome.  I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Chelsea Grill. The food was decent but service was poor. I find it wholly unacceptable to pay $60 for lunch with wine for two people and then have to take my check to the bar to pay the bill because the server cannot be found. This place needs to step up the service. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Currently my favorite place for angel hair and meat sauce in the tri-state area...........they have a unique sauce that is great!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Chelsea chicken was thin and cooked perfectly. Crab on top was excellent with the shrimp and the sauce tied it all together perfectly."}
{"text":"We have been patrons for twenty years.  Food is always very good with menu changes and old standards.  They take the time to provide eye pleasing potted plants at the entrance.  Service is swift and pleasant."}
{"text":"Food portions were amazing but all of the food was so bland! I had the chicken parm, it was not seasoned at all and the white sauce they put on it was literally tasteless. My boyfriend had the fried calamari which was ok but the marinara sauce was also tasteless! It doesn't even taste like they use salt and pepper! It really sucks because the food portions are incredible and the food was cooked well. But I won't be returning do to the lack of flavor."}
{"text":"LOVE Chelsea Grille... always a great experience... servers are very friendly and go above and beyond...  food leaves you with no surprises... i have SO MANY favorites here... remodel is fantastic with very warm and cozy colors... just makes it that much better!  You cannot keep me away from here!"}
{"text":"Love Chelsea's - food is outstanding - gets very busy on weekends so i would recommend a reservation-  MGR is wonderful - he accommodated us when we had a reservation issue - really great choice- love the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch menu!!  Most of the places my coworkers and I go only offer a small lunch menu, but Chelsea Grille has something for everyone!  Salads, soups, appetizers (try the stuffed portobellos!), seafood, pastas, sandwiches.  You'll be able to tell just from the heavenly smell when you walk in that you're in for a real treat.  Everyone in our group enjoyed their lunch entrees, though I wish the portobello appetizer was a larger quantity... I could seriously eat about 10 of those things!  They are stuffed with lump crab meat and draped with a fantastic sauce that reminded me a bit of a marsala.  For my entree, I ordered the shrimp salad because I LOVE arugula and this salad was jam packed with it!  Bibb lettuce, arugula, parmesan crusted shrimp, and tomatoes -- simple and delicious!  I paired it with the creamy chive dressing that was out of this world.  Next time, whether it be for lunch or dinner, I definitely want to try a pasta dish (or three). They all looked and smelled heavenly but I had to resist carboloading on my lunch break ;)"}
{"text":"Food was good but not outstanding. It is a serviceable community restaurant with overly large portions."}
{"text":"I had my most delightful sandwich ever! Their Lil' Johnny Stuffing Sandwich was divine!  I think it's only on the lunch menu.  They take stuffing and put it in a bread pan and slice it like bread! it was moist and the chicken inside was even juicer!  My only complaint is that it was dark inside. Kinda gloomy, but the food was so GOOD!!! Also their fries are batter fried! this is not a meal for someone watching their calories haha."}
{"text":"Ordered the spinach and chicken canaloni.  Mel ordered the chicken romano.  Both were excellent.  Had the roasted garlic for an app.  Doesn't compare to the Tuscan Inn's.  Waitstaff was attentive and knowledgable.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I am angry that  when I order a meal I am required is accept a starch. I would like my salmon with 2 vegetables. NOT potatoes or rice. Be flexible with your customers, to rigid..."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal. The chicken marsala, chicken Parmesan and eggplant parm were all delicious. Service and server were excellent even though it was very crowded."}
{"text":"Food was awesome and the prices were very fair! I got chicken parm and my wife got a fish sandwich. We also got fried zucchini to share. Portions are huge!  Amazing!"}
{"text":"The Chelsea Grille is my favorite restaurant! I have been there many times over the past year and have never been disappointed with the food or service! The fried zucchini and bruschetta are amazing! Their eggplant parm is another favorite of mine! I love the homemade cookies at the end of the meal as well!"}
{"text":"After walking around the cute historical town of Oakmont, we stopped into Chelsea Grille for lunch. The food was delicious, and nice sized portions for the affordable prices. Our service was wonderful; Penny was our waitress and made sure our drinks were never empty. I highly recommend the Lil' Johnny Stuffing Sandwich, which was a melt-in-your-mouth artwork of a sandwich!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Absolutely loved my Parmesan crusted chicken salad. The anchovie dressing is home made and paired perfectly with the mixed green salad. The Parmesan Chicken is warm as well which made it really good. AND, it's right next to the Oakmont Bakery which I'll review next."}
{"text":"Not bad, but set aside some time for your meal. I arrived for lunch and was promptly seated, and ordered fried calamari as an appetizer. The calamari was a generous portion and well prepared - it wasn't too soft or too chewy, and the breading was great as well. I then ordered eggplant parmesan and a meatball, which took quite a bit longer to arrive. It also came with soup, which was average and didn't really convince me that the rest of my meal would be great. Fortunately, I was wrong. The meatball had the perfect texture, rich and flavorful. The eggplant parmesan was well breaded, not oily or over fried, and was some of the best I've had. The pasta and sauce were alright, but they seemed a bit of an afterthought as they were very mild in flavor. All in all, I'd return if I'm not in a rush."}
{"text":"After some intense antiquing in Oakmont/Verona, I ended up at the Chelsea Grille with my husband. While the service was good and the Christmas decorations were lovely, the actual meal was merely adequate.   I had the Parmesan chicken salad, while he had the turkey wrap. The salad was quite large, but there was more cheese than lettuce and the chicken was pretty dry. The turkey wrap was fine, and the accompanying fries were tasty.  It was an okay experience overall.   The really great thing about eating here is that the Oakmont Bakery is right next door. So after our meal, we headed over for a coffee and a little sweet treat."}
{"text":"Friday night bar menu, along with the staff who work it, are terrific. Great place for comfort food"}
{"text":"Very good food. Especially for the price. The only downside to this restaurant that I've ever seen is the service. Even when there's only five other people in the restaurant the service is terribly slow. If you're not in a hurry this is the place for you. Everything that I've ever ordered has been delicious. The steak is phenomenal especially for the price. The specials are usually very tasty as well. Also makes a pretty good drink. I like how they have a different take on the old fashions on the drink specials."}
{"text":"Have dined here many times...this is my \"go to\" place for Fried Calamari.  Each time I've ordered it has been presented in a light buttery batter fried to perfection w/lemon wedges and marinara....these just aren't the rings, either!! As to the rest of the menu??? Couldn't tell you!! This is where I head when I want calamari...no place else compares so far!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and even better service! I strongly recommend this places to anyone out for lunch. The bar tender Sam is awesome!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this review short because I'm not a Yelper that uses this outlet to tear places apart.   Service was mediocre at best. We waited at the host stand for quite some time before the host returned, even after being noticed by multiple servers with no acknowledgement. Our server was just ok. No serious complaints, but nothing more than bare bones service. At the end of our meal we waited  about 20 minutes for our bill before the manager (I assume) finally brought it over.   Food was not good at all. I had the Shrimp Fritta with chicken noodle soup and roasted potatoes. He had the homemade ravioli with meatball. The soup appeared to be homemade and a little on the thick side, which was ok, but no flavor. I'm not one to season my food after it's been delivered, but I loaded that thing down with salt and pepper. Then the entree...four shrimp. Yep you read that correctly, four shrimp for 12.99 and a small tasteless side of roasted potatoes that I also topped with salt, pepper, and ketchup. Unfortunately I would take a frozen ravioli and meatball over this homemade dish any day. Lacked flavor and didn't taste fresh at all.  The best thing about this place is its close proximity to Oakmont Bakery."}
{"text":"First I want to say this is the first time I have been to Chelsea Grille since the remodel and I was so impressed. Last time I was there it was very outdated but now it's bright and looks beautiful! My mother and Aunt and I went for an early dinner. Mom had the Veal Romano with mashed potatoes and a house salad and we split the Bruschetta app. The Bruschetta was very good, I would have like more fresh basil rather than pesto with it but that is just my personal preference. Mom loved the veal and potatoes and was impressed with how much variety was in the house salad. I will say the bowl it is served in made it hard to cut as both her and my Aunt made the same comment and they loved the House dressing. My Aunt had the Chicken Romano and Brussels sprouts and she enjoyed both. I had a cup of Seafood Chowder and it was very good I was impressed with the size of the shrimp. I ordered the Seared Tuna salad medium rare. The tuna was cooked perfectly and the Mesculun Greens were nice and fresh. My only complaint was the Balsamic Dressing, it lacked flavor, it didn't have the right oil to vinegar ratio and no salt. I had to add salt to the salad which I don't like to add salt to food after it is cooked. I enjoyed the meal and I will defiantly go back I am dying to try the Polenta entree. Overall we had a very good meal and the waiter Peter was very nice. I love both Hoffstots and Chelsea Grille and always recommend them to people coming to Verona and Oakmont."}
{"text":"I was invited to dine here by my friend, my first time at the restaurant.  It is attractive and comfortable.  My dish, chicken miceli,  (Sauteed chicken breast layered with fried zucchini, Swiss cheese, then baked with Chasseur sauce) was delicious and it was more than enough for a lunch entree portion.  It came with two side dishes: a couple of bites of cole slaw and a large order of seasoned fries.  I wish I had been told that they were seasoned, not my favorite type of fry, but they were satisfying.  There was excellent warm bread and whipped butter.  The meal was reasonably priced at $11.99.  My friend had a chicken salad that was ample and looked delicious.  Service was pleasant and attentive.  I will return when I have the opportunity."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service and great ambiance. Knocked a star off because there was a high amount of flies around our table. Very odd. Otherwise a great little gem in oakmont."}
{"text":"Chelsea Grille is our go-to local restaurant. With a menu similar to Hoffstots Cafe Monaco but less expensive, it's a great place to get a reasonable dinner. Service is decent, although it can be on the slow side. The fresh bread is a nice way to start the meal; the house salad, with cranberries and candied walnuts, is fantastic; and, pretty much every pasta dish is a huge, delicious portion. My favorite dish is the Eggplant Mornay with Shrimp, which is a HUGE portion. I recommend ordering the appetizer side. With the bread and salad, you'll be just as full. Only a few of the desserts are homemade so we rarely order anything but the cakes are always good.   On a side note, The Chelsea Grille has just gone through a pretty major renovation and is now more open, airy, and bright. I was very impressed with the changes.   I will say that, on this visit, my husband wanted to order the special. The server said it was sold out so he picked something else - only to hear a server at the next table selling the special to another party. It was just weird.  Our bill (two drinks, two entrees, one dessert) was only $60, which is why we love the Chelsea Grille. If you're in Oakmont for the Open or to shop, consider the Chelsea Grille for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Cool place.  Tucked in a nice area.  I had the home made Gnocchi with two meatballs.  Very homemade flavor. The meatballs were like tennis ball sized.  The gnocchi was excellent as was the sauce.  My friend had the NY strip steak and said it was excellent.  Good atmosphere.  Friendly, fast service.  What more could you ask?  Great place.  I'll return the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service and the food was delicious! The house salad went beyond the usual side salad. Filet mignon was cooked perfectly. Parking was a bit odd, if I went at the dinner hour it probably would have been difficult."}
{"text":"Wonderful service.  The food was delicious.  The only reason I didn't give a 5 star is due to the fact that my food was a little on the luke warm side instead of hot.  The hostess went to a different restaurant to get us a high chair because all of theirs were in use.   I would recommend the St. Josef's pasta.  I will absolutely be returning to this establishment!  Prices are pretty fair as well."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.  Had the coconut shrimp, seafood bisque and a cole slaw.  All were delicious.  Shannon was the server.  No complaints."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, had a really nice family feel. That being said the inside looks like it could use a little love. While portions are generous, the food still seemed overpriced for the quality we actually got. Husband ordered chicken Romano and I ordered chicken parmigiana and we both felt like half the flavor was just egg."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places!   Always feel welcome when Corey and Sam are bartending.   Probably the two best servers all-time.  You guys ROCK!"}
{"text":"My in-laws brought me here for my birthday because they are in love with the sauce, and rightfully so. Their sauces are so flavorful that I was tempted to lick my plate clean, even though I'm normally the type to get light sauce on a dish.  The food is great but what puts this restaurant at 5 stars for me is the service. I have a severe food allergy that I didn't even think to mention before ordering. When I received soup that I realized could cause a really, the server promptly checked with the chef and ran back to warn me before any harm could occur. He then found me a safer side that was delicious and paired well with my St. Joseph's Pasta.   In short, come for the food but stay for the service."}
{"text":"The overall meal and service was excellent! I had chicken Romano and it was cut very thin just how I like it. The chicken was very tender and the sauce the poured over the chicken was very tasty.  The house salad was one of the best I ever had the pleasure if eating."}
{"text":"J and I came here for lunch this afternoon. We normally do research on restaurants before going, however today this was a spur of the moment choice. The dining room to the left and bar area to the right was fairly empty. There was no hostess at the desk so we walked in and asked a server if we should seat ourselves. She had a bit of an attitude and curtly said \"no\". She sat us and I asked her if they cook w/ peanut oil as I'm allergic to nuts. Again, I normally do research but this was spur of the moment. The waitress said that they cook w/ 3 different types of oils, including peanut oil and there really wasn't anything for me to eat. I asked her if she could double check b/c I found that odd that they used three different oils. When she left another waitress came and asked us what drinks we wanted. When I told her about my allergy, she said that they only cook w/ soybean oil. When I told her what the first waitress said, she looked shocked and said that that was incorrect. At that point the first waitress came back and said \"we're only cooking w/ soybean oil today\". It was a strange start to lunch, and as a result this place gets 3 stars. Now, on to the food. J ordered a coke and the fish sandwich w/ fries. I ordered a sprite and the Parmesan crusted chicken salad. Everything was pretty good, and they gave enough portions that we could take food home. Our waitress (the second woman) was kind and funny, and refilled our sodas quickly. We decided to split the chocolate skyscraper cake with vanilla ice cream, and J ordered a cup of coffee. The cake was HUGE and RICH. I don't see how anyone could eat it w/o ice cream or something else on the side. Overall the food was decent and everything was less than $40 which made J happy. They also played great music from the 90s which was a bonus. Not a bad spur of the moment choice."}
{"text":"Overlooked pasta.  Low flavor. Veal parm with \"omelet\" crest.  Bad salad dressing. No depth not complexity  to any of the dishes."}
