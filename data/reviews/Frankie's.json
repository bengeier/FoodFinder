{"text":"Nice atmosphere, friendly and helpful staff. For me, the burger was a bit greasy, but otherwise was great. 

The place is understaffed, which makes me feel like I'm being a nuisance when asking for something. Not the fault of the servers obviously, but something should be done to help them out and let them be personable instead of constantly rushed. To add to my server's workload, she was doing dishes since they don't have a dishwasher in the back. Also, the menus are all paper and not the most pristine looking. 

Would come back for the great service and fresh food, but I hope the owner hires more help and looks at some of the fine details. That will make this place less pretty good, and more amazing."}
{"text":"So happy to stumble onto Frankie's...

Everything you want in a diner and more! Cute spot with great food, great staff and great prices."}
{"text":"Great little local hangout.  Wine is cheap and free flowing. Burgers are also awesome.  What a gem! Just don't go in the daytime but great to watch the game and hang at night"}
{"text":"Frankie's is one of my favourite places in the neighbourhood. Great food! Great service! Great atmosphere! What more could a guy ask for right down the block on Queen West. 

Kudos to you for the amazing transformation your place went through, it is a real success story and adds a wonderful new take on the food scene in the neighbourhood. 

Your neighbour,
Shawn"}
{"text":"First impression: Wow! Great service and food. 
Ordered the #delicious which is as described from their menu: Homemade hash browns saut√©ed with onions, Bell peppers, and corned beef. Topped with three eggs with a side of toast.

I additionally requested: Eggs sunny-side up though still a bit runny,tomatoes to be fried with the beef and onions, and spinach on top. 

5-6 minutes later the server brought out my order exactly as I had requested! Was very impressed by the cook's attention to detail as the eggs were perfect, the spinach nicely placed on top of the eggs, and the actual meat of the meal well seared and cooked. Order came out hot fresh from the pan and it was absolutely delicious.

The cook who prepared my meal had a very keen eye, and I will definitely be back.

Only minor issues I took were with the hot sauce being in an opaque, rubbery ketchup container, the TV (CP24) being a bit loud, and the seats not having cushioned backing."}
{"text":"The BEST vegetarian burger I have ever had in my life. I usually remove the bun on my burgers but not for this one. The experience is too divine to ruin. I had the soy burger - moist patty, meaty texture. I added onions and blue cheese. My burger also came with potato chips. 
My boyfriend ordered the Ossington Melt. He was drooling. I didn't try his burger as I'm a vegetarian but I did sneak some of his sweet potato fries. Crunchy on the outside and perfect on the inside. Frankies is our new Friday night treat :)

You must eat here!"}
{"text":"I went in on Friday . I seen the sign they were doing ribs so I said \"why not\". At 13.95 with fries and coleslaw I couldn't go wrong. The ribs were fantastic fall of the bone. The beers are cheap and the place is real nice and clean . I'll definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Down to earth, TRUE Queen West roots. Great burger. Great Club. Mickey Mouse pancakes for the kids. Sincerely run. 

Bathrooms could be cleaner, but otherwise..."}
{"text":"I've been here now a couple of times and I regret now not coming more often! The breakfast here is outstanding. The prices are reasonable and the portions are indeed generous. It is also quite cozy and really comfortable inside. If you're looking for something fancy or pompous then you need to look elsewhere because this place is not at all that pretentious. It is however a place you can almost call your own because it has that family eatery type vibe with friendly and engaging service handled in the mornings at least, by a genuinely friendly lady that does her best to make you feel at home.. Not only will I be back for more breakfast in the future, I also want to come by during regular menu hours (after 12 noon)  and give it a go."}
{"text":"Lovely, family-oriented owners
Highly tolerant of the two four-year-old boys I come in with regularly

 Low prices for \"American portions\" 

The spot has been around for a long time. What i respect is that they treat all patrons with respect, some of which are CAMH patients. 

the burgers are, surprisingly, to die for... recently I overheard a woman in the booth next to me  recommending the burger to her friends, they ordered them and raved! 

I LOVE the club sand which.

VERY kid friendly! An order of pancakes for my son often comes in the shape of Mickey Mouse!

Dont expect a trendy or pretentious environment, do expect one that is true to the neighbourhood... prices are low, attitudes are sincere. 

Great  and inexpensive spot to meet fot breakfast, a casual meeting or a even a hockey game. 

Worth a visit, for sure"}
{"text":"Ordered the eggs neptune for brunch. The smoked salmon was fantastic with the hollandaise sauce on a crispy english muffin. I would definitely recommend it. 

The homefries were great too. I didn't like the sausages as much, though, and the veggie omelette was good but not as good as the eggs neptune. Maybe I'm biasd though since I love smoked salmon. For the prices, though, the food is worth it. 

After we got our drinks, the waitress informed us that it would be another 25 minutes before the food would be ready. At first we were a little concerned because we had to be somewhere else later, but the food actually came out in about 10 minutes, so that was an unexpected but pleasant surprise. 

If I could, I would give Frankie's 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Tried this place since my boyfriend tried it and had nothing but great things to say about it so thought I would see what the rave was about. Their motto is best burger in town and don't agree with that at all. They have an interesting variety of burgers which is a plus however mine was merely decent. Was  almost burnt and overcooked and didn't impress me at all. Nothing special or out of the ordinary. On the bright side the Bartender (our server) was friendly. Dont think I'd go back though. Open to try their breakfast if I did.  The city needs more breakfast joints."}
{"text":"Fantastic place if you feel like being blatantly ignored for 35 minutes, have to beg to order coffee and inevitably have to walk out. Cheers to Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Ate here with some friends. Food here is good. I ordered a grilled chicken Caesar salad and it was a nice big portion. The grilled chicken is very juicy and not dry or rubbery at all.

Restaurant has free wifi to connect to and board games if you want to play something.

If you have mobility issues, please note that washrooms are downstairs on the basement level. You will have to go up and down some stairs.

For Pokemon Go players, there is a stop nearby but it's not close enough to be constantly accessing it. If your GPS likes to make you walk even though you're actually not moving, you might sometimes be able to touch the stop."}
{"text":"Came here for the burger, was not disappointed! Frankie's Original is 6oz (so decent sized patty). It's loosely ground, great texture, very very juicy, and the toppings are fresh and abundant. The fries are the nice thin cut kind, and the onion rings are large with well cooked soft onions inside, comes with bbq sauce to dip. For under $10, you'll leave very full. A friend got the big mac knockoff, which is two 6oz patties. It was insanely tall, and he couldn't eat barely any of his fries afterwards. We only had water to drink too. Really great value, very tasty burgers. Restaurant is clean and new-looking, despite apparently being around for 40 years."}
{"text":"I know my burgers.  I'm somewhat of a burger connoisseur and let me tell ya this is one great place.  Finally a burger joint that when I finish it, I can actually say I've enjoyed it and am actually full.  Great choices, look fwd to coming back again."}
{"text":"I'm thankful I don't live around the area b/c this diner would easily become one of my fav restaurants.

Atmosphere & service: The atmosphere is a clean hipster designed restaurant. Felt very bright and comfortable eating there. The waitress was informative but seemed like a no nonsense kind of person. Smiles would've been welcomed but honestly she was good at her job so no real complaints.

Food: burgers! I went @ lunchtime on a weekday so they might've had a different menu for dinner. I had the hogtown burger which was BBQ pulled pork with their beef patty, crispy bacon and coleslaw. Simply delicious and even their salad was fresh. I liked the way they plated their food. It looked appetizing as soon as we saw it out of the kitchen. 

Would definitely recommend and reasonably priced too. Watch out for the specials for even better deals!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place doesn't hit the \"Top Toronto Burger\" list because it is consistently awesome."}
{"text":"I come here at least once or twice a week for takeout. I always get the chicken souvlaki and greek salad so I cant comment on the rest of the food, but its a great cheap and delicious option for breakfast, lunch or dinner and I always make a note to tell people about it if they are in the area. Good food doesnt have to be expensive and trendy!"}
{"text":"Been here numerous times for breakfast & lunch...such a good deal! and such good food! Eggs benny is delicious!! Burgers and onion rings are good too !"}
{"text":"My breakfast was super delish I really enjoyed it they gave me so much I didn't finish"}
{"text":"I lived on Ossington and passed this joint over a hundred times. I never gave it a second thought, as it always seemed like a sketchy bar where old drunks go to die. One time a month ago my boyfriend and I were in the neighbourhood and my blood sugar was dangerously low enough to kill someone, so we popped into Frankie's as a means to avoid homicide and wet our whistles. 

We ordered the pulled pork poutine and a cobb salad. To kid ourselves of making healthy choices, we substituted the regular fries for sweet potat'er ones (which wasn't a bad choice, by the way). I was shocked by how solid, good the food is there. The salad was abundant and fresh, with good portions of everything. Caesars are practically perfect for $5, with a pickled string bean instead of celery! Yum!
The poutine had just enough gravy and cheese and didn't skimp on the juicy pork. \"This is the first time I've seen you actually satisfied by a poutine,\" my boyfriend said as I rammed a dripping forkful into my obliging maw. 

When I went back a second time, I ordered the tex-mex burger. Again, enough guacamole and cheese and fixins. The patty was the way I like dem thighs, THICK. Homemade fries...no more words necessary. You get what you pay for and they aren't over-ambitious with their style. It's classic and it's good. 

Due to popularity and convenience I had been to The Lakeview one too many benders. Cram that place and the kitchen gets overworked and sloppy. Pork gets dry. Burgers aren't so friendly. Next time you're thinking diner food in the hood, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Had a pretty rough experience here. Ordered over the phone, and asked for a Frankie's original with just cheese and ketchup (yep, I'm that guy) with a poutine on the side. When I got home with the burger I opened it up and found mustard, pickles, relish and onions on it. Nowhere on the website did it say that this would be on the burger, and also they didn't add my cheese. Then I looked at the bill and saw they charged me 5.95 for my side poutine when on the website it says 2.95. The poutine ended up tasting decent, not amazing but pretty standard as far as diner-type places like this go. If it wasn't for the poutine I would have given this restaurant 1 star. Regardless I do not plan on going back."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed, just completely satisfied when going to Frankie's. Food is delicious and made with love.  Love the fact that it is one of the original staple restaurants on Queen. Customer for life."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with the wife and everything was great. Supper cheap and cheerful."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with Frankie's? Great food, good service, an eclectic clientele making for some great breakfast conversations. While other breakfast places have long line ups, Frankie's always has a seat for me."}
{"text":"Awful! and the flies were nonstop!  If I could leave this place a negative star I would!   I came to this placed based on the yelp reviews...I should have known it was the worst when the cab driver asked why are you coming to this restaurant when their are so many other places in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"I have been going to Frankie's for lunch a few times a year for a few years now. I have never been disappointed. I usually get the pulled pork mac and cheese and love it but have also had other menu items such as burgers. This is a great place for good food at very reasonable prices (especially considering the portion sizes!). The other thing I really like about Frankie's is how chill it is. I have never felt rushed or anything like that. There's quite a few regulars who come in and sit at the bar and nurse a beer and the staff are super friendly about it. In short, this is a great place for a yummy comfort food meal."}
{"text":"Was baffled by the high rate of this place, which turned out to be quite a disappointment. The food was below average, the host/waitress/bartender was totally unfriendly and the interior looked cheap. Besides, since when can't you have side salad instead of fries? Apparently now you have to pay extra for it."}
{"text":"// I don't understand all the good reviews this place is getting.  My partner and I were there today.  The food took 30 minutes to get to our table, our server was seemingly uninterested in us after she took our order, and while the burger I had was okay, the wilted salad I had with it was only matched by the awful hash browns my husband received with his breakfast.

The place was not super busy, but even if it had been, that's no excuse for poor food and poor service.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Had brunch last Sunday at Frankie's.  Breakfast was $5.95 for three eggs, three sausages, homefries and toast.  There was live musician playing rock and roll covers on an acoustic guitar and diners were getting up to sing!  The service was great, the price was amazing and the vibe was more Saturday night than Sunday morning.  So happy to finally find my go-to Sunday brunch spot."}
{"text":"A mainstay for me, Frankie's has reliable breakfast, lunch, and dinner covered. It has great value and never disappointed me. 

Today, I was more impressed than usual when the server asked me \"is this your watch?\". It was! I had left it there two weeks earlier...and they held on to it for me! I've been late for everything without my Timex, but no more. Thanks Frankie's."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Great Food, Great Service, Decent Prices and Never Disappoints. 

Food: Love the Texan Burger w/ Sweet Potato Fries ($1.50 extra). Great wings. 5/5

Service: Lovely waitresses, always attentive. Even when it's busy. 4/5 

Ambiance: Bar/Diner. Cozy, casual. 3/5

Price: Decent Prices. Defenitly worth it for what you get. 4/5"}
{"text":"The food at Franke's is simple and classic brunch food. We came as a group of three and got seated immediately on a Tuesday morning. The waitress was nice and brought out waters and took our orders quickly so we would get our food ASAP. 

The food itself was nothing too fancy but good flavours and decent portions. I would say the style of potato they serve is not my fav but a bit of salt and pepper will do wonders to it. 
Would come again for my post-hangover brunch with friends."}
{"text":"I had their original burger here. To be honest, I think this place is better than Burger's Priest(deep fried heart attack) and Richmond Station(soggy burger).

The presentation is lacking, but the taste is the best. The patty is grilled perfectly. It had a little bit of char, but not too much that it's bitter and not too little that it tastes uncooked or worse, still bloody that it makes the buns soggy. There is nothing worse than a soggy burger. The original burger is served with fries and some spiced mayo.

Service was friendly and helpful. The server showed all of the good specials they have and didn't try to rip me off by talking about their fancy toppings. This is a plus for me because I rarely got servers who don't say that everything on the menu is good.

Most burger places in Toronto depend on presentation to get hyped and almost all, fail to live to that hype. Frankie's gives you no fuss burgers, grilled perfectly, and spiced secretly. Don't expect fancy burgers with truffles or what not when you come here."}
{"text":"Their burgers are absolutely amazing - they taste like BURGERS, which is shockingly rare these days.   The prices are decent and the food is good.  When I've gone in, the breakfasts look INCREDIBLY YUMMY, but I haven't had the chance to try them yet.  

A lot of people I know like the cobb salad.  It was okay (the lettuce is basically shredded into tiny slivers, which is a bit odd) - the chicken was fresh and it was tasty, but it took FOREVER to make (I waited almost 40 minutes) and the salad dressing was almost entirely oil.  Like, to the point where I wonder if they made a mistake and gave me a little container of oil instead of dressing.  But nope, someone else I know got it and had the same complaint.  It made the salad absolutely disgusting.  So if you order it to go, make sure you have a good salad dressing to go with it.  I'm normally not fussy - I like a good oily dressing YUM! - but I'm not a huge fan of pure oil slathered on lettuce.

I think it's a bit ridiculous that they charge you for using a credit card there, but last time I went, it was only a minimal charge."}
{"text":"This is my second review on Yelp. The first was sheer disappointment. This one is to reflect my absolute amazement. 

Frankie's is a very open friendly environment. I've only come here twice, but it's gotten better each time. All of the servers are extremely friendly, where they take their service to a next level by approaching you with a relatable reference, pun, or honesty that you can appreciate and respect. 
 
Now the main reason for this review is the food. I'm a huuuuge pulled pork fan, moms is the best of course.. No one could ever beat it. Until my visit to Frankie's. Perfection. I look forward to my next visit to Frankie's...I hope you look forward to your first, and many more to come, because this place will definitely keep you coming back. New found love."}
{"text":"It is always a scary situation to walk into an establishment you've walked by several times, but have never entered, thinking it was a bit \"sketchy\", but I have to say: Frankie's is neither sketchy nor scary. It is probably one of the most inviting, quality restaurants that genuinely cares about the customers and food they serve. 

On a later-than-we-should-have-been-out-with-a-three-year-old, my wife and I decided to venture into Frankie's at about 8:30pm with our over-tired and over-hungry son. The establishment is small, but the layout uses space well, and is beyond reproach in cleanliness (which can be difficult to achieve late on a Saturday). 

We were greeted warmly, and were not rushed to make choices from the wide offerings in the menu. And what an offering! It's a balanced menu with calorie-conscious and self-rewarding items, all of which read deliciously. 

My wife ordered the four-cheese grilled cheese (and was asked at the time of ordering if she was sure she wanted the blue cheese, which I can appreciate, knowing some people aren't fans of the blue- but she went with the item as designed, blue cheese and all). My son wanted macaroni and cheese, and I ordered the Canadian burger, knowing you can't really go wrong with that combination, and being in a new restaurant, I wanted to play it safe. 

What great food!! It was ALL delicious, offering quality, well-considered twists on each plate. The grilled cheese was a cheesy blend of flavours that simply... worked. Grilled to perfection. The Mac and cheese was a kid's (and adult's) dream - cheesy, tasty and clearly made from scratch. The burger and fries was probably the best burger I've had for a long time (and I've eaten at Burger Priest recently) - the ground chuck was tender and spiced well, the bacon was grilled to perfection (not the rubber so often encountered in so many restaurants), and the maple mayo made this burger into the stuff of dreams. This wasn't a burger to be consumed quickly: it deserved to be savoured. 

On the way out, we chatted with the chef and our hostess/waitress, and offered our compliments for a fantastic meal. Not only did they seem genuinely happy to hear we enjoyed our visit, they seemed honestly modest in accepting the praise. Everyone should try Frankie's. I know we will return soon."}
{"text":"They recently underwent renovation. The new signage says \"Frankie's, THE WORLD'S BEST BURGER\".
Given my previous love-hate relationship with the old Frankie's (it was Cheap, but oh-so-many-unpleasant-smelling-people-around-me, but its Cheap!), I had to give it a try.

The place now has 3 plasmas at the bar, some small-uncomfortable-looking (but clean) booths, and good lighting.

I *think they kept the old menu and the old price too (maybe the fries went up?). I ordered the Original burger with cheddar, and a glass of white while I waited.  
I wasn't asked how I'd like my burger, but she was friendly while I sat at the bar. My server was kind, BUT, VERY preoccupied with the cute gay couple sitting next to me, and didn't see me try to wave her down for some water . Oh, well. I don't blame her.

My burger (just under $7 after tax) was actually, med-well, and comes with pickles, lettuce and tomatoes. Still the same mediocre cheap burger from the old Frankies. But the meat was very dry, despite having a hint of pink in the middle. I also tasted some jalape√±o in the mix perhaps? (which I liked). 

Overall, if you want my verdict in a phrase, it's Big Mac but slightly bigger.

Don't get me wrong, I'd go back, it's in my 'hood. I just felt let down because their new signage seemed to promise more."}
{"text":"My review is based on my first and only time visiting Frankies, but I honestly don't expect a great deal of variation. What you have here is a dirt cheap, licensed grub-diner kind of deal. I think I paid about $6 for a bacon cheeseburger with fries, plus a $2 draft of Coor beer (not Coors, Coor). The burger immediately reminded me of the frozen discount brand patties my family used to barbecue eons ago, which isn't a terrible thing for someone like me (I have a great love of food, I can be picky, but when I'm hungry my standards are fairly slack). 

This seems like an excellent place to go after getting slammed at a near-ish, cheaper bar for some cheap food and maybe a few refresher beers. I love how close it is to the park / my house, so we'll see how it combos in the warmer months. With seldom exceptions, you get what you pay for. I'm quite sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"(Review is of weekend brunch only) Unfortunately, the weekend brunch shows all the signs of a young team that doesn't know what it's doing -- we hope this can be chalked up to growing pains from overhauling the restaurant from L'il Baci. Service was inattentive, and the plates (including on neighbouring tables) looked tired and uninspired. Salads, sides and eggs looked limp and colourless. Multiple people on the patio received thin-looking BLTs that were not cut in half -- not a sign of a seasoned kitchen crew. The Hollandaise on my poached eggs was a wet and translucent coating - barely noticeable. Instead of an English muffin the Benedict was served on a single thick slice of burned toast, the carbonized flavour of which totally overpowered any egg or Hollandaise water I might have otherwise tasted. The wife got a small bowl of pasta with a poached egg on top, and again both the presentation and the flavour was flat. The dining room and backyard patio of this cozy spot are beautiful -- here's hoping the brunch team finds its inspiration soon."}
{"text":"Very good value. I had their big breakfast and #Delicious. Everything was very solid, the pancakes were buttery, bacon was done just right, the corn beef hash was indeed delicious. 
I would def recommend this place to a friend, and will come back again."}
{"text":"Live around corner never ate here. Came here after movies with a friend one night. Burgers, fries and salad fairly good. Gravy tasted burnt. My friend wanted wine against my wishes. They served cheap Fusion wine at over $5 a glass..for $2 more he could have gotten the bottle. The waitress said they were NOT a 5 star restaurant but a diner. Oops!! Long time to get the bill cause only 1 person working. 
Place clean throughout though.....
Maybe return to this diner for breakfast one day.."}
{"text":"Price decent, food good, but service is quite slow.  They were understaffed with only two working the front on a weekend the time I was there, not sure if this is a regular thing thou.  

I had the Egg Neptune which was great.  The sauce was light, yet flavourable and the poached eggs oozed perfectly when cut into.  The taters were also a good size cut with a decent quantity.  Overall, a great place to go for breakfast."}
{"text":"If your in the neighbourhood for brunch, you can't beat this place. 

Cheaper food, great service, the decor is really basic but clean. 

Bacon slices are nice and thick. Basic breakfast for 3 eggs, 3 slices of bacon, 2 pieces of toast of white,rye, or brown, a slice of tomato and homefries for around 6 bucks."}
{"text":"Was excited that Frankie's had a facelift and was very impressed with the interior. was very disappointed in the meal, the grilled cheese was created on restaurant takeover and looked delish but in reality it was messy, smelly and tasted greesy. The crowd at this place is really sketchy and the staff was not friendly, they were actually arguing with each other in the kitchen!
Save your money for one of the many other queen street gems!"}
{"text":"YUM! We're in Toronto for the weekend from Michigan, so we had no idea where to eat. Came here bc of the great yelp reviews and they did not disappoint! The food is fresh and portion sizes are great. You can get a giant plate for only 8 bucks. Sides are generous portions as well. Get a side of hash browns! They're soooo yummy and crispy. I had the french toast and it was heavenly, and all of my friends loved their breakfast, too. Definitely a great find!"}
{"text":"Holy hell, what can I saw about this marvellous place? I've been going to Frankies for FIVE years now and each time I go, I'm super satisfied. Firstly, the guy who runs the place has been there for years, and I believe he is the son of Frankie himself. His love for the place shows up in the food. 

The burgers are great and come in a spectrum from basic to psycho-crazy-cool. You want doritos, chili, a fried egg, bacon or nearly any kind of cheese on your burger? You got it! Their sandwiches are great too. Their club sandwich was a staple when I was going to school in the area, a REAL chicken breast and thick cut bacon? AMAZING! And who doesn't love a mid-day pint? As far as I remember Kool has been on tap there for years, and the kegs are always fresh.

It's a clean place, and offers a chill, relaxed diner atmosphere. There are regulars, buy I've never had any trouble with any of the others who have rolled in. Quite the contrary! If you're a bit of a social butterfly like I am, you can find plenty of people to talk to, some more colourful than others, but this is Queen West! 

Chicken tenders are high quality, their fries are unreal, and you'll find something for everyone. They always have either basketball, hockey, or baseball on. It's a great place, and if you're local, looking for an affordable and friendly place to grab a bite, then Frankies is perfect!"}
{"text":"Sur les avis √©logieux de notre ch√®re CM Evelyn, je me suis rendu dans ce caf√© dans le sud ouest de la ville. 
Ici on est dans une restauration typique de dinner nord am√©ricain avec omelettes, burgers et salades Cesar.
Le gros avantage est le rapport qualit√© prix, des plats copieux et un service rapide.
A recommander si vous √™tes dans le quartier et que vous cherchez un brunch le dimanche matin."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with the place. The place seemed like under staffed. Kinda stuffy environment. We ordered #delicious and waffles. The food quality wasn't bad so hence the three stars. The price was good too. 
Got a table close to kitchen. Kina stank every time they opened the door. The waiter wasn't very presentable, let's just say that. Hardly cleared the plates or attended much to the table.."}
{"text":"Great Price - Affordable

Good Food - A Little Con * Hollandaise Sauce Wasn't The Greatest 

Great Service - Quick * Friendly * Clean

I definitely recommend this place and look forward to coming back !!"}
{"text":"I like coming here for consistently good food. Most satisfying when you want diner food but don't feel like doing the dirty diner thing. There a good vibe here that is brought out by the servers and atmosphere. Always a bit busy with a good amount of background noise. I recommend the Cobb Salad."}
{"text":"Not an extensive menue but what they do they do well. I had the classic cheeseburger and it was very juicy and delicious. I like the layout w the wooden tables and benches. Only downfall was it took a long time to be seated on a slow day. I like the music they play throughout day is classic and enjoyable And they have a large selection of bottle  beers."}
{"text":"The best breakfast I've had in Toronto, hands down! After reading the stellar reviews on Yelp, Tiffany N and I strolled down the street from The Gladstone hotel and popped in around 11 a.m. The place wasn't full, but definitely not deserted either. I noticed a sign for cheap mimosas and Caesars on the way in which was awesome.

The place is lovely. A bit of hole in the wall vibe mixed with some comfy booths and tranquil colours make it a great spot for breakfast. I decided to go with the Guac Omelet which was amazing, and shared half of Tiffany's challah french toast - super yummy as well!

Our server, who was holding down the fort, was kind and patient and the vibe was totally a comfortable place I'd love to become a regular at. I can't wait to visit this place again when I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Frankie's is your typical diner. Average food, average place, average (sometimes below) service. I've always picked up take-out. The first time I went I got a burger, which was meh, and the fries were so bad I didn't return for a while. There is a lack of places to grab quick lunch food in the area, so I came back in some time for the chicken souvlaki, and the reuben sandwich. Both of these are grossly overpriced. The souvaki is alright, but I prefer the mall version. The reuben was very small for $10. It was made from those small sizes of rye bread. I was expecting a sandwich so big it would be cut in half for that price. When I ordered the reuben over the phone, the server asked me if the fries were okay, or if I wanted a different side, as she proceeded to list them. I asked her, does it come with a side? And she said no, actually... Okay, so why are you asking me? Or tell me it's extra? But for $10 + tax, it should come with a side. It was a decent tasting sandwich, but should have been half price. When I asked the server why it's double the price of the chicken souvlaki sandwich, she said \"I don't know, I only work here.\" Lolz. This is the type of response I've gotten in the past to some of my questions. Their milkshakes are artificially tasting, but are yummy.

They also open at 8 am, unlike what their info says."}
{"text":"This is the PERFECT place to go and eat an early breakfast, or if you want a nice, clean burger that's well-made with giant steak cut fries.

The restaurant has a nice and simple layout, with a very warm and welcoming feel to it. Everything is spotless, including the bathrooms which are very well-maintained.

I usually order the \"Big Breakfast\" or the \"Eggs Benny with Pulled Pork\", and the food is SO CLEAN and well-made that I can survive for the day without feeling like I ate a brick. I also don't feel \"off\" or sick like I usually do from other restaurants that I've ordered breakfast from. I can't stress enough how CLEAN their food is. 

For lunch or dinner fare, the burgers are your standard old fashioned burger, with an assortment of topping choices, or you can select from the pre-made concoctions they have on the list, though nothing really jumped out at me. Nothing too  daring or unusual that would maybe get people talking a little more about this place . However, the burgers are very well done and also VERY clean in the gut, but it's nothing \"gourmet\" or anything I'd write home about..

The staff is super-friendly and very attentive to tables, aside from when it comes to bringing the bill. I think it's just because it's a very \"down-home\" type of atmosphere and they're not rushing to get people out of the place, which is OK with me. This is just a warning to people who may get impatient (I would suggest to go up front and pay at the bar if you plan to leave within 5 mins after eating.)

I feel the bar could use a bit of improvement, but that's only a minor issue that I have with this place.

All in all I would say that Frankie's has a winning old-fashioned formula, and a knack for keeping things simple yet effective. 

If it isn't broken, then why fix it?? I'm happy with a restaurant that keeps old-fashioned food going in the middle of a \"gourmet tornado\" of \"try-hard cooks\" with something to prove. However, if you want gourmet, there are tons of alternate options for you on Queen, but I urge you to give this place a try."}
{"text":"Can't say I recall the last time I put my fork down after a breakfast and immediately started to feel the fluish waves of headache and stomach pain. This places takes greasy spoon to a level not even reachable by small town diners attached to gas stations. Thank the lords we shared this heaping plate of old, dirty grease, bland overcooked eggs and undercooked potatoes, and skipped the all-day-on-the-burner coffee. Blech. The staff seems sick too, why are they here today? No thanks, Frankie, I'll pass on the side of laryngitis."}
{"text":"This review is for the cafe, not the bar. I don't drink, so no clue if the bar is any good, and you shouldn't trust me anyway!

The cafe is terrific.  Service is excellent.  The food is really nice and is a great value especially in comparison to most other Queen West cafes.  The omelettes are tasty, the pancakes are what you want in a pancake.  The peameal bacon is off the charts good."}
{"text":"This is a good breakfast place on a hipster street.   Nice decor.  Friendly staff.  Good value.   They accommodated us by reserving a table (for a few minutes) even though it was a non-reservation time because one us had mobility issues.    A  neighbourhood restaurant with good breakfast choices."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch and to be honest, I thought my eggs benny were pretty mediocre. The hollandaise sauce was very heavy handed, and didn't look particularly appetizing, even though I love that stuff. It was overly thick and a brighter than usual yellow. I was also unimpressed that the side veg was a few slices of cucumber. Bleh. Hubs liked their burger though.

We did get seated right away and by the time we left there was a short wait for a seat. I can see how it could be a good neighbourhood place. The prices are very decent for downtown brunch."}
{"text":"Craving a Canadian rendition of a Big Mac? Have a thing for no-frills brunches sans hour long waits to be seated? Well, chances are you'll dig Frankie's.

I'm sure if I lived in Toronto (and resided in Queen West), I'd be somewhat of a regular. I love a good greasy spoon diner, and Frankie's seems to elevate that slap dash genre a few notches up the bedpost. With familiar favorites that anyone in North America would recognize along with items to fulfill any regional cravings (peameal bacon BLT for instance), they've got you covered. Plus they make a pretty mean Caesar complete with a delightful pickled green bean to boot. 

Best of all, if you happen to be taking out Suze Orman for a meal, she'll be proud that you picked an inexpensive place like Frankie's to indulge."}
{"text":"I previously really enjoyed the freshly prepared salads but something changed in the last three months where the cooked ingredients were stale multiple instances.

Today was the final straw when I found a pubic hair in my food.

It's become hard to look forward to the next meal from this place when food handling/hygiene has become questionable."}
{"text":"I've had the burgers, fries, poutine, rubin sandwich, and of course breakfast at Frankie's and I have yet one complaint to make. Neither do any of the companions who accompanied me each time and who selected and enjoyed other various dishes. Friendly service, historic, and a walk around the corner for me. Can't ask for more!"}
{"text":"What a great experience !!!!
Our waitress was a gem !!! She greeted us warmly when we entered the restaurant and was attentive ,patient , considerate , efficient, cheerful ... ( I could go on and on about her !.) . Our meal was tasty  and reasonably priced . I loved the sweet potato fries !!! The restaurant atmosphere / environment/decor  was what we wanted ( lively , comfortable ,casual  and artistic ). 
We will definitely come back here next summer . We are visiting from NYC and are going home this weekend. Wish we could go eat at Frankie's next week :)"}
{"text":"The food was ok my potatoes were burnt.  And we waited over 25 minutes for our meal.  Definitely not a good place to go if your hangry !!!!"}
{"text":"Looking for brunch spots on Queen West, this seemed like a good place for one of us to brunch and the other to lunch.  

Service was great - very friendly server who offered a few suggestions for food.  We took her up on one - the pulled pork eggs benny (amazing) and I piggybacked on that and went for just the pulled pork sandwich.  Not one for heat, I asked for no jalapenos and it came out with them anyways.  One bite in and I had to send it back - it came back jalapeno free and was excellent.

Overall, great prices, great service and great food.  A definite must for food if you want a diner and are in the area."}
{"text":"Cozy modern diner that serves up classic diner menu items with quality ingredients. When you first arrive, there is no room to stand and wait for your table so either come down early for some breakfast or head over later to close time for some lunch. Like I said, the place is small so I would avoid coming with a large group of friends (best is to come in a group of two since this place accommodates best for small groups). The breakfast is affordable but tastes amazing! They offer everything from classic breakfast to omelette to pancakes. The coffee is much better quality than your typical diner coffee! Give this place a try for your weekend brunch cravings if you're in the Queen & Ossington area!!"}
{"text":"Great greasy spoon in the neighbourhood the food is great. Place is a little small so if you have a big group you might not get a table right away if you get there around 11-12 on Saturday or Sunday but it is worth the wait. Prices are cheap."}
{"text":"Yesterday we picked up some burgers to eat in the park for Canada Day, and damn what a way to celebrate. We got the Canadian burger, the Frankie's #1 and the Hogtown. The Frankie's #1 was absolutely delicious - with two patties, pickles, secret sauce and a sesame seed bun it blows the McVersion of this burger out of the water. It, like all of their other burgers, was MASSIVE. A two-hander you can't put down. The patties were well-seasoned and succulent, and they didn't hold back with the toppings!

We upgraded to poutine because, well, Canada Day, and it did not disappoint. The gravy was yummy (although I could have used a bit more cheese) and the thick, steak-cut fries held up their end of the bargain and didn't get soggy or mushy. 

I highly recommend Frankie's and their delicious burgers. I do not recommend you eat one if you have anything else to do that evening because the food coma was pretty deep."}
{"text":"Of all the places that state they have the \"World's Greatest Burger\" I would say that Frankie's might actually live up to that claim. The husband and I arrived in Toronto in the afternoon and after some relaxation, we decided it was time for a bite and a brew. I started searching Yelp for something in walking distance. As we are staying in the Queen St West district, there were a lot of options. I am always game for a good burger and Frankie's had good reviews so we decided to check it out. 

First off, above and beyond the amazing food, the atmosphere and the bartender/server Zee, set the tone for our experience. We're from Michigan and I am a huge hard cider fan. I knew I liked Zee when she recommended one of the best hard ciders I've had to date. Toronto's own Brickworks Batch: 1904. So that started things off right. In the front of the bar, \"Two Old Guys\" jammed out on their guitars singing set after set of the classics. They rocked!

Now, let me tell you about the food. I ordered The Canadian burger. It had 100% (perfectly cooked and juicy) Canadian chuck, Canadian cheddar, lettuce, tomato, red onions, Peameal bacon, some crispy things (fried onions?) and the best sauce I've ever experienced - Maple Mayo. I may have died and gone to heaven. The fries were crispy and delicious, though I couldn't eat them all after packing away that burger. After dinner, Zee kept the drinks flowing, and convinced us to stay and have a great time. She is an engaging bartender and I do not have a single regret about spending a small fortune on burgers, ciders and shots. That is not to say Frankie's is expensive, it's actually quite affordable. We were just racking up the tab because we were having such a fantastic time. 

So thank you to Frankie's, Zee, Two Old Guys, Brickworks Cider and Toronto for a great night. Josh is still sleeping off his hangover. We're definitely coming back here in the future."}
{"text":"Frankie's has always been a top brunch place of mine. They serve you with decent portions at affordable rates. This is the 6th time I've come back to Frankie. Had been used to going to the location on College and Yonge. Decided to try this place as it was closer to Eaton's. Service is great, their staff are always greeting you with those smiles that just brighten up your morning."}
{"text":"Weekp, they say they're open at 7am and I walked over at 7:15 prepared for amazingness. They were closed and the lady inside told me come back in 5-10. It's 8am now and they're still not opened so I went to Starbucks. Bummed but so hungry I just can't wait any longer."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times before, and have always had an excellent experience with their food. Cheap, large portions, and really tasty. Great bang for your buck if you want some comfort food. 

I love their pulled pork Mac and cheese. You're not going to finish it, so prepare to have some for the next day too. Great \"problem\" to have! Their sweet potato fries are a go to if I'm not that hungry. 

Vibe is hella casual so you're not going to feel like you don't belong. You know the feeling I'm talking about. 

The one thing I would say is that their beer isn't great. I've never not had a flat beer here. It's not somewhere you're going to exclusively for drinks anyway. The food is the highlight here. Drink elsewhere then come stuff your face at Frankie's."}
{"text":"Disappointed based on reviews. 

Disorganized, and the staff scraping off dirty dishes, then handling the clean ones without hand washing in between,  was off-putting.  

Food was nicely cooked though."}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best food in toronto. It's American portions- which is obviously amazing. Everything I tried on the menu was good. Also- eggs Benedict and poutine for breakfast? Gets rid of those woes real quick"}
{"text":"Food is well priced and is actually decent. Service is great. Would come back for sure."}
{"text":"small portions, okay pasta, slow service even when it isnt too busy.
my pasta needed more sauce and the bread we got wasnt very flavorful. i'd recommend going to fusaros instead."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant had their mushroom melt was so big so tasty. We were a group of 6 and the others had the chicken wing's thai chilly ,fish and chips and chicken with rice great taste.  Also had the sweet potate fries great. Sampled almost all the dishes . Really a great place to eat a must go to.

As far as the serve Zee is great very cheery was really friendly and will come back when im in the area."}
{"text":"Best burger in town! It was so tasty and cooked perfectly (slightly pink). The fries are good but not my preferred kind- they are clearly homemade but I am embarrassed to say that I like my fries more...processed. The onion rings are crispy which is good for most but I like mine a bit softer. Service is fantastic- came with the kids and they were very kind. Decent beer selection. Looks like nothing from the outside but worth the visit!"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast but had their famous burgers instead.  The Frankies #1 burger is like a big Mac but waaayyyy better with two huge patties,  it was filling.  The Texan burger was a lovely melody of spices.  Not too spicey.  The jalape√±os were deep fried and the guacamole was very delicious.  The side greek salad was huge and the onions rings were good also.  Service was great and price wasn't bad either.  Can't wait to return for their all day breakfast."}
{"text":"We live right around the corner from this place and get take-out from them all the time.  For what you pay its really really good. Love the chicken club. Fries are not the best but still edible. Kind of always full of weird people though..."}
{"text":"This is a tough review to write. The food was fantastic; I got the Frankie's #1 Burger with Poutine, and my girlfriend got the grilled chicken club. The first problem was that we weren't greeted as we walked in, although I got over that quickly. The food took quite a while to be ready, and once it arrived, we didn't see our waitress for another maybe 20 minutes. She gave us very small glasses of water which we finished quickly...all we wanted was a refill. It was 90 degrees outside, we each could have drank pitchers of water. We had to flag her down for the water refill, and she arrived (annoyed) with what was basically warm water. 10 minutes later we had to flag her down for our bill. Luckily, they have free wifi so the extended dinner wasn't a huge problem. So, all in all, the food was five stars but the service was one star. The other reviews seem to note great service, so perhaps I came in on a bad day."}
{"text":"One Sunday afternoon after a weekend bender with some friends visiting for the weekend, we came here for brunch because it wasn't far from where our friend lived and where we were staying for the weekend. When the five of us got here around 2pm and most of the brunch crowd has just been sat and most of them are finishing up, so there was just enough space for us. I reckon it would be much busy with queues had we tried to come here earlier. 

There's seating at the bar and decent amount of seating at tables, likely to accommodate a larger group.

They have your usual breakfast/brunch items. As usual, I went for eggs benedict (read my Ann Sather review), although they didn't have crab cake benedict, I went for a smoked salmon benedict, which is the next best thing. The order comes with a side of potatoes, but due to lent, I had given up potatoes and asked if they could substitute it for something else like sweet potato fries (which I can have). 

The answer is no, you cannot substitute your potatoes, you have to order the side as additional side. This doesn't make sense to me, I'd be okay to pay the difference if it cost more than the potatoes, so if I replace the potatoes with sweet potatoes, it would only cost $1.50 instead of $4.25 (*not actual price for sweet potato fries at Frankie's, but from what I remember, it's close enough). When I was about to give up arguing and tell them to just omit the potatoes, the server suggested to replace it with a salad. Which I still had to pay $1.50 for because it is an \"additional side\" even though I didn't have the potatoes (as a side, it costs more than $2).

I'm disappointed with their inability to be flexible. I used to work in the service industry and nowhere has it lack the willingness to accommodate to the customers. It wasn't like I had asked to customise my entire meal. 

The food and server was pretty good and the only reason this didn't end up being a one-star review. 

Come here only if you do not have any dietary concerns and order off the menu as it is, because they won't replace anything anyway. I feel ripped off at the end of this meal."}
{"text":"Came back with more people, ordered (mostly) different stuff, and I now think it's worthy of a 5 star rating. They're still understaffed, and this was really apparent on a Saturday at brunch, but the food. The food.

Frankie's #1 burger was again amazing. The meat is so ... meaty. Almost decadent, with how strong and beefy it is. The pickles were really good, actually. The 4-cheese grilled cheese (ordered with extra brie instead of blue cheese) was buttery and delicious. The fig jam was a perfect accent - sweet and smooth.

I ordered the Rocky (cheesesteak) with onion rings, with no peppers. The rings were unimpeachable. The steak was tender and (again) meaty. The cheese was perfect.

5/5, eagerly awaiting my return."}
{"text":"I went to Frankie's and ate two breakfasts. And I feel like I should put it on a shirt or something.

To be fair, I didn't eat all the breakfast on the plates and I did share the French toast, but when confronted with a menu made of all the items I want to order I have a hard time choosing. This is why I ordered both the French toast and a standard eggs/bacon/toast deal. If you want my advice I say get the French toast - it is so diner-delicious!

The prices are cheap and if you are in the mood for drinks I hear they are a real bargain here.

Frankie's is definitely one of the best breakfasts I've had in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Within the same week I got a call from management team of Frankie's who profusely apologized for the incident.After investigating the matter he courteously invited me to Frankie's and I went there last Saturday.Looks like the staff members have been coached because the servers including the one who was rude last time, we're very polite to all the guests. THEY were serving and asking every guest if the food is good and if they need anything. 
I am happy that they take the customer,s feed back seriously"}
{"text":"we stumbled in here and had no idea it would be so delicious!! everything is amazing. the atmosphere is also very homey and relaxed."}
{"text":"Decent burgers and friendly staff in a quaint and cozy restaurant, with more than fair pricing.
I had the Hogtown Burger which comes with pulled pork. Admittedly despite asking for certain ingredients to not be included it came with the works but was still tasty. My dining companion had a veggie burger which he said tasted like the Yves patties you get in the grocery store, but by adding a fried egg and sauteed mushrooms, he said it was one of the best prepared veggie burgers hes had in a while.

Sidenotes: french fries were a bit greasy but nicely crispy and pretty good tasting. Also, 5 beers on tap to choose from (Kool, Moosehead, Barking Squirrel, Mill Street Organic, Mill Street Tankhouse Ale).

1 Hogtown burger with fries, a veggie burger, order of deep fried pickles, and a pitcher of Barking Squirrel came to $47 after tax before tip which is a pretty fair deal. And for that, a 4 star review is due!"}
{"text":"When I came in, I did not feel very welcomed at all. Once I ordered, the sever was not very nice. I order a Rocky which is a Philadelphia Cheese steak sandwich. When I got it, I was very disappointed, the melted cheese tasted terrible. The sandwich was a mess. The steak parts were delicious but other than that, it wasn't a good sandwich. So I only ate the steak parts and once I payed and told the sever I didn't like it. She gave a dirty look and was so rude to me. I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"Walked and waitress said it would be a few mins for a larger booth for our group (2 kids 3 adults). Waited. Another group came in and took the booth and the waitress didn't say anything. We stood at the bar waiting and decided to sit near the bar. The lady behind the bar was rude to us saying that we couldn't there. Needless to say we went else where."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast.  I loved everything I got. Nice waiters. It was a slow Monday morning when we were there. My friend and I sat and enjoyed watching Price Is Right on the big screen while locals (who obviously are regulars) talked about how they disagree with the answers the contestants gave. It was so chill and laid back. It's great for anyone who likes to stay away from the tourist stuff and just hang like your at your favorite local place. I'll be back there again."}
{"text":"Really good food and service.  I recommend the Guac Omelette.  The home fries were good as well.  Casual and friendly staff."}
{"text":"After a long day, I just wanted a return to my roots so tried Frankie's for the second time. I had the pasta with clams (hold the bacon). It was a small but exquisitely prepared delight with chili flakes and the lightest of white sauces. A glass of dry Prosecco and cordial service completed the evening. Thank you."}
{"text":"had the canadian burger with sweet potato fries,, was very surprised, wasn't expecting such great food. Not the best burgers but if your in the area you won't be disappointed,  Also very filling but a little over priced."}
{"text":"Best spot on Queen st. For bfast. 
We were sitting at Drake's first, service took forever and wasnt cordial at all. 
All the contraire here at Frankie's where you feel at home.
Food is great, service is awesome and pricing is balanced -just like the flavours 

5*!!"}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast place. Great food and service. Try Frankie's, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great diner. Big portions for good prices and they have great specials often as well. I had athe chicken and waffles last time and they were perfect!!"}
{"text":"Fast, fresh and tasty lunch yesterday! I was craving a burger and Frankie's did not disappoint. Hot fries accompanied a plain burger with all the garnishes and it was just what I was looking for...with cheerful and prompt service. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice diner but nothing amazing. The Reuben was very good and the portions are generous (a TON of fries). There was too much meat on the Reuben for me but I just picked some off and then it was perf. The chicken caesar wrap was tasty as was the Greek chicken wrap! The waiter was very patient with our indecisiveness when we needed about half an hour to stare at the menu. Didn't really FEEL like a diner but pretty cute"}
{"text":"We headed over to Frankie's as a result of great reviews for their burgers.  

D√©cor is functional.   The burgers were fine - they wouldn't make my top 10 list.  Waitress was nice.   

Would I return:  If I lived in the neighbourhood, I'd have no problem going back - but I don't and there are other places I'd rather check out the next trip to Toronto.
Would I recommend:  Unlikely at this time."}
{"text":"Overall it was an ok experience at Frankie's. The food was well cooked and the size was huge. But the waitress with blonde hair was kinda rude. She said my friend and I could sit here because this table was for 4 people, but there was a couple who also sit at the large table. Then she said if the restaurant got busy later, we had to change to the small table. Excuse me?! Did she ask us to change the table when we ate? But the other waitress with dark hair was nice and I hoped the tip went to her."}
{"text":"After spending a night in a hotel in downtown Toronto for a work event, my husband and I went for an impromptu brunch before heading back home to Mississauga. We decided to move away from the comforts of Cora's and after doing some Yelping, came upon Frankie's. Thankfully there was a parking spot right in front of the restaurant that opened up right when we got there.

Food: As good as it gets. I was feeling something savory and \"diner-like\". I ordered Frankie's Original Breakfast ($7.95) which had 3 eggs, sausage, home fries and toast. I can't complain at all about it. Everything was perfect and I loved the inclusion of the tomato slices and the availability of hot sauce. My husband ordered the Frankie's Big Breakfast ($10.95) which included sausage, bacon, eggs, toast, home fries and pancakes! He said his was great too. Our only feedback would be that the pancakes were a little on the hard side. What really stood out for us was the value of the dishes. They're very well priced for the amount that you get. 

Service: It had a family restaurant feel to it and when our server was busy someone else jumped right in to help so we never felt ignored or forgotten. The food came out in a timely manner (thankfully because we were starving).

Overall experience: The reviews totally didn't disappoint. I liked how it was small and cozy. When we came in it was a little confusing because I wasn't sure where to stand to wait but that really wasn't a big deal. We waited for less than 15 minutes. I liked the tvs by the bar so there was something to watch in the meantime. I'm not familiar with the area so I'm not sure about parking but I know that there is at least street parking. We would definitely come back to Frankie's because it's a simple place that's been around for a long time for good reason."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious meal last night. My boyfriend and I were walking the area, we saw this place, decided to walk in and give it a try. BEST decision this year !!! Delicious kale/radicchio salad with outstanding Caesar dressing, delicious delectable thin crust pizza with incredibly fresh toppings of fiori di latte, roasted eggplant, superb tomato sauce and thin crisp crust to hold it all together. Our waiter from England was superb, knowledgeable, funny, and very honest and helpful with their menu. The menu isn't extensive but trust me, their choices will please you... Don't walk RUN !! and eat there... Bravo and best of luck Frankie's...YUMMY !!!"}
{"text":"Frankie's was probably the only brunch place which had a relatively short wait time on a Sunday afternoon. Sunday brunch in downtown Toronto is extremely popular. I would recommend going early around 11 am if you don't want to wait in lines. 

So finally we got seated. The servers were quick in taking our orders. I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Peameal bacon. I was a bit hesitant about it since it is hard to get right. I took a risk anyway. The food arrived relatively quick. I was quite disappointed with the poached eggs as they were almost soft-boiled. The Hollandaise sauce was a bit on the tangy side. I would probably skip this dish and order something more traditional if I were to come here again. My friend ordered some pancakes and they came with table syrup. Service was attentive. Overall not a bad place but I have had much better."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I went to frankies hoping for a normal lunch...but once we walked in no one showed us to a table and the waitress just stared at us and ignored us. So I just led myslef to a table as I am a regular so I didn't think it'd matter since she didn't have the courtesy to show us to a table (there was a table free and clean and no one else came before us). I didn't mind about how she didn't show us to a table...but it took her 40 minutes to get us our food and when we asked she said she didn't know when it's be done and she did not bother to check or assure us she'd check with the kitchen. I've been going to frankies since I was in high school I have never had this kind of service even when it was super packed or busy the server would always come up to me right away to either take me to a table or assure me she'll come help me in a bit...."}
{"text":"Exactly what I wanted that morning - cheap, filling, fantastic breakfast. Nothing pretentious. Nothing over the top \"gourmet\", just sticking to the basics."}
{"text":"I can't refuse the opportunity to check out local diners wherever I go. Curious as to how Canada does breakfast (if any different from America) and Frankie's did not disappoint.

Huge portions and a good selection of your typical breakfast menu -- Canadian bacon is of course thicker so that's a huge plus. 

Our waitress was friendly. Prices were cheap for the amount and quality we got.

Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast at an even better price! Hash browns are nice and crispy, try one of the benedicts. Service was prompt and friendly - no wait for Sunday brunch - and I love the ambience."}
{"text":"Ok so- I am reviewing and rating Frankie's on the fact that it is a cheap diner. Not five star cuisine. It is a hidden gem in west queen west. For what it is- Frankie's is amazing. 

FYI- if you want a nouvelle dining experience, and don't care about the price-point, disregard this review. 

Food- great for what it is. Salads portions are generous. Omelettes are probably the star of this place, second to the burgers. Yes they do not have crazy variations with fois gras or truffles, but what they do, they do well. 

Drinks- I ordered a White Russian the first time I went to Frankie's. The waitress told me she didn't know how to make it, but if I told her how, she would be more than happy to. WOW. Ended up with a classic and delicious White Russian. 

Service- AMAZING. AMAZING. Wish I knew the name of our waitress to give her props. She accommodated every request (White Russian, changing cheese on salad order, dressing subs) without blinking an eye. 

Frankie's is one of my favourite places. The low key atmosphere, great price:food, and amazing service make it a highly recommend place to check out, as long as you know what you are signing up for (ie not a 5 star gourmet meal with duck liver pate with caviar)."}
{"text":"Great little diner with a really sweet waitress. This little nook has great food and a relaxed atmosphere. If you are in the area stop by and get the french toast."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast.  Hit the spot: bacon, pancakes, sausages, etc.  Also great low-key feeling.  Staff was real friendly."}
{"text":"Got the Eggs Neptune for Sunday Brunch.  Hollandaise sauce was spot on in flavor. And the garnishing was fresh and well presented. Great food, very reasonable prices and friendly, prompt service."}
{"text":"SO...this ISN'T THE BEST FOOD in the city, but it's quite delicious considering the price point and it's super convenient. 

I've been here a couple of times and the food is consistent. The burger's a quite good (they actually taste like meat), and the onion rings are hot and fresh (though the french fries leave much to be desired, as they taste slightly of onion rings and are a little soggy). 

The chicken wings are good, while being large and super crispy! 

The price of everything is UNBELIEVABLY CHEAP, especially considering the location, and service is super friendly! 

I'd definitely recommend at any point during the day (especially post drinking eats!) and will probably be back for just that!"}
{"text":"Go to Annabelle's instead!
In all honesty it pains me to give Frankie's only 2 stars. 
I live in Leslieville and have been travelling across town to Annabelle's ever since I discovered it because it is that good !! I was so excited when  Frankie's (their sister resto) opened up around the corner.
  Alas, I will get back in the car and travel across town.
\"we do three fresh pastas that change daily $10\" 
Nope! they are  $12 -$13.  Is it a big deal ?.. maybe not. But if the menu says $10 (as does Annabelle's) then why does the chalk board say otherwise??
Pastas were disappointing ... not al dente in fact under cooked.  
Spicy Meatballs - under cooked and missing the spice altogether. 
To be honest, just lacking the same flavour and magic as it's sister Restaurant. 
On a positive note, Good Service, Good Space (the patio is great).
But the food was a miss. I really hope this is simply growing pains and they will achieve the same delicious success as Annabelle's."}
{"text":"Grabbed a late lunch with a prominent thespian and enjoyed everything about the experience from the humor of the staff to the perfection of The Canadian. Don't say no to the sweet potatoes"}
{"text":"I had to give it a 5 star, I'd have to think really hard to even attempt to come up with a complaint to justify only selecting 4 stars. 

Frankie's has a small town feel when you go in for a late Sunday brunch, smiling faces greet you and there's a team dynamic to ensure everyone gets their orders fast. 

Split the Pulled pork eggs benny with crispy hash browns and a side of fresh cucumber & tomato. It was great, and it didn't last long on our plates. 
Had to try one of the infamous old fashion burgers and it was absolutely delicious, toasted sesame buns and a med rare patty. And a Poutine, which took second place over the hash browns (which shocked even myself!)

Its sweet little spot, I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Ordered brunch here on a Saturday morning and enjoyed every bite of it! Used Doordash and they arrived on time with the food hot. I got the eggs florentine and my cousin got the chicken tenders. The eggs florentine was amazing perfectly cooked. The chicken tender on the other hand wasn't cooked enough and the batter almost tasted raw,so disappointing after my experience with the eggs. Will be ordering here again just not for the chicken tenders!"}
{"text":"Awesome food for low prices - really good value. Have tried multiple things on the menu and they're always generous portions and great tasting."}
{"text":"I came here randomly with my boyfriend for dinner before watching Rent at Lower Ossington Theatre.

I got a Somersby blackberry flavoured cider. It tasted like medicine at first and I almost regretted not getting the apple flavour. However, after a few more sips, it tasted better. I would've never expected this little bar and cafe to have such an interesting selection of beer.

After going through the huge selection of burgers available, I decided on smokin' hot honey burger and I upgraded my fries for some sweet potato fries. The burger was delicious! Unfortunately, I do not do well with spiciness and I was dying halfway through my burger. I took out all the jalapenos and it was still spicy! My boyfriend then informed me that the patty itself was also spicy so be aware of that. I was so happy that I upgraded my fries for some sweet potato fries because they were delicious and made to perfection.

It's easy to pass by this restaurant because it doesn't look like anything special from the outside but it's definitely a nice place to grab a bite and a drink!"}
{"text":"After running a recon stakeout from across the street like Robert Redford and Richard Dreyfuss with binocular flasks, I figured out who this Frankie really is, and he is Guy Fieri in witness protection north of the border. Hiding next to the camh after school special hangout of Tom's, between the blocks featured in the New York Times and Vogue, there lies \"Frankie.\" 

Snowed in, not caring to ask about menu items and hunting one down online, I saw the two words \"Texas\" and \"burger\" put together on Yelp, a seminal duo where nothing could go wrong like the buddy cops, Gibson and Glover. 

In Frankie's eyes Texas means a burger with fried jalapenos, nacho cheese doritos chips and nacho cheese. Mammas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys who don't order the Texas burger."}
{"text":"Gord and I had breakfast this morning at Frankie's Bar & Cafe.

We both ordered Frankie's Original Breakfast.  I had mine with ham and home fries.  Gord had his with bacon and fruit.

The server was doing double duty by cooking ... and it showed.  My toast was cold.  My homefries were both hot and cold.  I had ordered my eggs easy over and one was medium.  Gord also ordered his eggs easy over and all three of his eggs were medium over.

It's probably quiet in the morning so is more cost-efficient to having one person do both jobs ... but it's too bad the quality of the meal has to suffer."}
{"text":"Had brunch here on the weekend. Was initially going somewhere in Liberty Village but a certain restaurant which didn't allow for reservations had a wait time of up to 1.5 hours. Ridiculous. Anyhow, we walked around and came across to Frankie's. The only seats available was at the bar, which was fine. 

The service was good and the food came fairly quickly. I also liked the prices as it wasn't inflated like most places in the area since it was in downtown Toronto. 

Ordered the big breakfast. It was alright but I question the number of eggs used. The big breakfast is supposed to come with three eggs. I did ask for scrambled, and I usually make three at home also, but it looked more like 1.5 eggs were used. I had a huge craving for pancakes... but it was definitely better at I-Hop. But yummm Canadian Maple syrup !!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, huge portions, reasonable prices and nice/fast service. What more can you ask for in great breakfast spot. Would recommend and will return."}
{"text":"I came for a light breakfast with my bf. We split the Frankie's Original Breakfast and got the peameal bacon for $1.50 extra. Unfortunately, they don't have gluten free toast or pancake options, but the rest of the breakfast was delicious! The eggs were perfectly cooked, and the home fries were super crispy. Best potatoes I've had in a while.

It was a bit chaotic in the restaurant. The two waitresses seemed frazzled and understaffed, but they were friendly and served us in a timely manner. The food is affordably priced. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I was really curious about this place as I had passed it so many times.
Sat at the bar.
I tried the Greek salad which was superb, mainly because it was more village like and had two extra large slices of feta on top.
I'd like to go back to try some other items.
Price point is great."}
{"text":"I walk by this place at least once a week, and never ate here till recently. TBH, I thought it was a dump. How pretentious of me! On a whim, ate brunch here with a few friends and needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised! Yes, it does attract some eclectic folk, but it really adds to the charm!

Place has mostly seats for small groups, with a few bench style seats for more in the back. Was super busy when we got there so it was about a 25 minute wait - nothing to gripe about for Toronto. 

Food menu is CHEAP! Felt like I was stealing when I paid because the bill was so low. Don't let the price indicate the quality though, the burgers were off the chain! Burger menu is extensive, but I just got the Frankie's original....with poutine. A bit dirty but don't judge. Real curd, and the gravy was hot and beefy. BT ordered the waffle.. must've been good cuz there wasn't a crumb left!"}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I went here for a date and it was fantastic.  The staff was super nice and the burgers were one of the best I have ever had.  I had the Texan burger and dear lord, so much flavor!! Definitely recommend this place.  Also, pretty decent pricing too!"}
{"text":"i can't get enough of this place. 2nd time i went here within a week and they never disappoint. i had the fish with greek salad special...large amount and the fish w as delicious. excellent crunch factor. no fishy taste. and good batter. my friend had their turkey burger with sweet potato fries special. honestly, I've never had a turkey burger before and this was the best burger i had in general. warm juicy patty, amazing toppings and the buns were whole wheat. the fries were delicious and large. would highly recommend this place for awesome eats at an affordable price"}
{"text":"Service was excellent, food was just right. Prices are great too. For $5.95 you can have great bacon and eggs :)"}
{"text":"Went to Frankie's last night for dinner and it was delicious! Crispy fries, tasty burger, delicious chicken wings, and a chocolatey shake. High on calories and high on taste. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge diner fan, so when I moved to Toronto and saw I was across the street from Frankie's, I couldn't resist. My first time going I had their pulled pork eggs benny. It was DELICIOUS, the eggs were poached perfectly, the hollandaise was the right amount of creamy (and it didn't separate), and the pulled pork was flavourful. What really stole the show, if that was even possible, were the home fries. They're crispy, but soft on the inside, and seasoned to perfection. I was blown away! 

I heard that the burgers here are really good, so literally 3 days later I came back for lunch. I got the Texan which is crispy jalape√±os, spiced havarti, guac, and Doritos on top of a burger. I thought my first bite of that burger was the best I've ever taken but... it just kept getting better somehow. All of the flavours and textures worked so well together. The beef patty was thick, juicy, and done JUST RIGHT (I hate when diners over cook their burgers).

The service is efficient, friendly, and quick. My glass was never empty and my food never took long. This is a must try in the Queen West neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Wandered into Frankie's around midnight on a Friday night. 

Very eclectic mix of clientele - lots of drunk underaged Asians (I'm sure this was random), a kooky local who was camped out at the back playing solitaire and a few normal looking types ordering drinks at the bar and eating late night burgers.

My date ordered a Greek burger (hyuk hyuk) with sweet potato fries. Fries were definitely tasty but I didn't try the burger. Although it seemed everyone around (drunk people) were really enjoying their burgers.

Friendly waitress and prices were decent. Good spot to stop for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"The burgers here were delicious and the toppings were plentiful and just the right amount of food on the plate. At first the fries look sparse, but trust me. The space is beautiful but apparently lacking AC which sucked on a hot day. Service was slow, but it was lunch and I'm guessing they don't get TOO much business around that time - forgivable. The strawberry milkshake was soooo good too.


 :) My kind of place."}
{"text":"The space was newly refreshed, and the service was great as usual. They have great options on the menu and at an affordable price for Italian comfort food. 

I know they are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, but we only dined during dinner. My husband and I opted for their daily $10 pasta specials which is a steal. There were 3 pasta options to choose from when we went, and we ordered their cassarecce and fusilli. Both pasta dishes were delicious and pasta was cooked to al dente. The portion is on the smaller side, but if you order a side to share with the $10 pasta it would be a good meal.

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's all about the downtown TO weekend brunch scene! I wouldn't say I was disappointed with this place (ok, maybe a little), but only because of the high rating and lineup for seating. This is a solid brunch/breakfast place with some decent lunch options as well, albeit nothing spectacular. 

FOOD:

The Eggs Benny I ordered was a bit over-cooked, so the eggs didn't have that desired \"runny-ness.\" The peameal bacon was tasty, and the Home Fries plentiful, but bland. Veggies on the side was a nice touch.  

SERVICE:

The servers behind the counter were friendly and attentive. No long wait times for the food. 

ATMOSPHERE:

Nice Mom & Pop shop vibe here. It's a bit cramped, but such is the downtown experience.

VERDICT:

I probably wouldn't go out of my way to dine here, but if in the area (or as a backup plan), it's the way to go."}
{"text":"3.5 Cheap place to grab brunch/breakfast in Queen West. There are a lot of options, but expect your standard American breakfast choices. I got the guacamole omelette, and while it was decent the guacamole tasted like it came from a tube and not fresh."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Frankie's on a whim last Sunday for brunch because the original place we wanted to check out was a 30min wait. We waited less than 10min to sit as we agreed to sit at the bar.

We were so hungry so we quickly ordered the same things: a cup of coffee, and the pulled pork eggs bennys.

The food didnt take too long, and it was a massive portion. You could probably share one order between 2 people. 

The pulled pork bennys, oh man, I don't even know where to start. It was so saucy and delicious. Just thinking about it makes me want to fall into a food coma. That plate was literally the epitome of a food coma. Highly recommend this dish, but highly would not recommend it if you have plans to be active after. I didnt leave my bed for the rest of the day after that.

10/10 hangover/brunch meal"}
{"text":"Frankie's Bar and Cafe is a gem hiding in plain sight. Looks are deceiving and this place is no exception. Depending on what time of day you peek into the storefront window, you might mistake it for a hole in the wall. Of course, you'd be completely wrong. It's pretty modern and updated looking in here, including screens to watch sports on near the bar.

Must-try items:
Frankie's #1 Burger
Frankie's Original Burger
Chili Cheese Fries

It's clean and inviting, and 1 server is enough to keep customers attended to. That's rare in today's bar and restaurant world. The prices will definitely win you over, as well as the portion sizes. It's a comfortable place to have a drink as well. I'm planning on coming back for breakfast anytime soon. They deserve bonus points for being open early till pretty late. Don't miss out."}
{"text":"Cheap and big portions of food. Came for Sunday brunch at around 10:45am and there was a backlog of parties waiting to be seated, but the tables were available. There were only 2 ladies working the entire floor so you really need to flag them down if you want anything... from ordering to getting a coffee refill. 

I ordered the big breakfast for $11 and I have to say this is one of the cheapest places I've been to for Toronto breakfasts. Bacon/home fries/eggs/pancake were all amazing. I had a really empty stomach that morning and I still couldn't finish it.

PSA they also charge an extra 25 cents if you pay with card."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast after another restaurant was Too full. The restaurant is located on a hip street. As we walked in we needed to wait for a spot. The restaurant is quite small so I would not recommend coming in bigger groups. We were 6, so we had to sit at the bar. The wait time was about 25 minutes however when we sat down our food came pretty quickly. This is a great place to come for a basic breakfast. I haven't tried their burgers so I don't have any review regarding that. Other than that it was a good place."}
{"text":"One of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I've had in awhile. Challah bread loaded with four cheeses (cheddar, blue, brie, and swiss). I. love. blue. cheese. The sweet fig jam they provide to dip it in is a nice change from the traditional ketchup (but don't worry they still give you ketchup too), and the side fries are the high quality chip truck, skin-on kind. Top it off with a can of pop and its really everything you need from a good diner dinner. 

Extras: service is fast, and you can easily get in and out for around $15-20 tax and tip included. The ambiance is nothing special but its pretty clean and comfy so it works."}
{"text":"Frankie's is a must! This was a great experience. Came by here on a Sunday evening for some food with two good friends. We all got different things and we all loved it! I got the Texan Burger and it was honestly amazing, especially with the Doritos, guacamole and deep fried jalape√±os, a must try. I also got the sweet potato fries which was probably the best sweet potato fries I've ever had. Plus our server Jordan was extremely nice and helpful, she deserves a raise  :)"}
{"text":"Great small restaurant, nice staff, cool vibe. 

Food is very average. Came for brunch, hollandaise was very thick, potatoes were overcooked/cold, toast was cold, omelette was bland. Spinach and feta both have strong flavors, so I was surprised the omelette wasn't very flavorful. Cheap prices though, so you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"The old lil Baci sort of redux.  A bit of a facelift and some tweaks to the menu but still the same great food and comfortable vibe.  We stopped in for a cold beer and a few pizza's... and yes!!  The pizza is small, big if you aren't starving but a good size for a personal.  The pizza is really worth a trip - fresh thin crust flavourful and melt in your mouth.  This has always been a neighbourhood staple and I am happy to see they didn't stray too far from a winning combination."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed Frankie's. Super delicious! My favourite part out of our meals was the onion ring poutine. I nearly convinced my husband to not order it and I am glad that he did. Amazing onion rings! I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Really a fan of this place. Ive only ordered take out and mostly burgers and chicken, but its been a success every time. Not mind blowing mind you, but pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Frankie's only has three stars? Ridiculous. This is a rare occasion where I want to run around Toronto shaking people screaming \"Try it again! TRY IT AGAIN! Come on, people! Frankie's is The. Best.\" 

Pitchers of beer are barely over $10, and the food. Oh the food! Their lunch and dinner specials are huge plates of homemade upscale diner goodness for reasonable prices. Just the other day I got the chicken fingers, a salad and a poutine and cleared that giant square plate happily. That plus a pitcher of beer I bought for the table came to $23 dollars. You really can't beat that. 

Menu favourites? If you ask they will make you onion ring poutine - hold the fries, bring on the rings and their version of the big mac. Go to town, burger lovin' buddies. 

PEPPER POINTS for the service. They once slightly undercooked something and I watched them make up for it not once, but twice for my friend. Huh? Yep. They remembered on the second visit and sent some fried chicken over for the table. Sweetest service around the strip."}
{"text":"Oh Frankies, you are near and dear to my heart. I've been coming here for the past year because of the proximity to the theatre I work at and for the good prices! Cheap drinks and cheap, tasty grub. Wins in my book!

Also the service is great. Super friendly servers. Usually have specials but the burgers and some appys are definitely notable. I'm a sucker for diner food and this place always satisfies me. I frequently come alone when I'm in the hood for a quick lunch or dinner and sometimes with a group for post show drinks and grub. Always leave happy. 

If you're in the area and like diner food or a good burger, definitely pop in!"}
