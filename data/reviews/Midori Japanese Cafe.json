{"text":"The sushi was well-priced and tasty.  My dude wasn't won over by the chicken teriyaki he ordered, but I guess it was decent.  There are korean options on the menu but I didn't know how veggie-friendly they were so I stuck to sushi.  Midori is a cute little place and I prefer it to other sushi joints nearby."}
{"text":"It was a tight space but cozy. I ordered a vegetable jap-chae  ($11) and the wait time was around 20 minutes. It came with a side of miso soup, but the actual dish came with less jap-chae than expected. The dish was split into half white rice, half jap-chae, which was not advertised in the menu. Was a bit dissapointed that I paid for jap-chae and got more rice than the actual dish. Service was friendly, and they had no problem splitting the bill between friends."}
{"text":"Midori was our go-to place for years. They had bad dishes (negi toro made from cheap cuts, and instant ramen), but also some great rolls (anything with the spicy mayo sauce). Everything was a reasonable price. I also appreciated the noodle dishes and Korean food that added a little variety to the menu.

It seems there are new owners now, and while the quality of the fish has improved, the sauces have not - where is my beloved spicy mayo? The prices have also increased dramatically.

I almost want to give this place 4 stars because it's still better than the many mediocre sushi joints in the SW, but it's not what it used to be."}
{"text":"Perhaps not an upscale eatery, but food never disappoints. We frequent this place since it opened and never had a bad time!"}
{"text":"Was on the hunt for casual and cheap japanese food one late evening, thought I would give this place a try. Ordered a tempura ramen (didn't know that was a thing) and a few salmon rolls. The salmon was ok, nothing special. Tasted like salmon, was appropriately sized, and didn't get me sick. 

Was expecting real ramen - think fresh wavy noodles and thick, rich pork bone stock. Instead I got a bowl of original flavor instant noodles with a few skewers of soggy tempura on top. Reminded me of desperate college midnight meals I would rather forget."}
{"text":"I find the sushi at Midori's as good, if not better, as any place in Calgary without the crazy prices. They original rolls, which is good for those who are adventurous. It is a small restaurant but I love the cozy atmosphere. The only downside is the service, which can be iffy. They are always very polite, but sometimes the wait for the food is long, and the waitress doesn't come around  to check on you very often. However Midori is a favourite of mine despite its faults."}
{"text":"Good cheap sushi and rolls on a 17th ave patio. Great in the summer as you can people watch while having your meal. It is also a novelty to be able to eat sushi outside giving the meal a much more social feeling to it as you can chat, people watch and nibble away at your heart's content. 

They also have some great sounding Korean dishes that I will be back to try.

{"text":"I love Midori.  Maybe because it's pretty close to my house, but there are other features that keep bringing me back.

Pros:
Tuna tataki - so damn good here, my favourite in the city
Pretty good sushi, tasty, and a good variety of rolls
Friendly service every time, food comes out in good time
Patio - love sitting on 17th people watching while eating sushi
Reasonably priced

Cons:
Pretty small place - if it's busy you can wait awhile for a table (but you can do pick-up if that helps)

Overall, every experience here has been good and I will always be back. Can't get enough of the tuna tataki!"}
{"text":"Now that I am firmly established in my perch overlooking 17th Ave SW, I find myself hankering for a little sushi lunch action every once in a while.  Being that there are a couple of options close by, I have made Midori the spot where I bring colleagues as I believe it has better value and quicker service as compared to its counterparts.  

Pros:
 
If you order the bento box (sushi - about $15, chicken or beef teriyaki - about $13) you are going to leave full.  Add a roll to this and forget about any productivity for the afternoon.  Fast lunch service but arrive early if you want a seat.  Excellent \"junk food\" sushi, you know, the kind with tempura, bits of other fried goodness and such. 

Cons:

A bit pricey, very small dining room.  No waiting area for take away customers means guests waiting are learing while they wait.  Special rolls are quite expensive, especially when compared to the amounts of food received in the Bento.  

I kind of wish they did a lite version of their Bento subtracting a few items and bringing it in under $10 bucks.  That being said, if you need a sushi fix in an intimate environment, then this is a place for you."}
{"text":"You would think after my recent quest for the Sushi Samba badge that I would be sushi-d out for a while. Well, that is not so! A trip to Midori is always a way to put a smile on my face! 

Midori is my favourite \"hidden gem\" place for sushi in all of Calgary. It is a family-run, small restaurant that just does it well. The sushi is reasonably priced (sushi is always an expensive date!) and we are always served with a smile. Neither the decor nor the sushi is fancy, it is just a really comfortable place to go for some really tasty food.

The restaurant has all of 5 tables plus a few seats at the bar and there are even a few outdoor seats for those warm summer days. Despite that, there is never a long wait. Take out is a popular option as well. 

I highly recommend the green tea, yam tempura rolls and spicy salmon rolls. Just thinking about those makes my mouth water... in fact, I might just have to make a trip there today....

{"text":"My girlfriend and I love Midori! The fish is always fresh and the prices are excellent. We particularly enjoy the spicy crunch tuna roll and spicy salmon roll, but everything we've tried has been great. Midori is the only place we come for sushi in Calgary."}
{"text":"The spicy salmon role is delicious! It has plenty of spicy sauce for all eight pieces. The service is very friendly, but the food takes a while to get out of the kitchen. Unfortunately, despite rhyming our order back to our waitress, we ended up with only one order of ramen instead of two and it was missing the dumplings. However, it was the server's first day and mistakes happen."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi restaraunt in Calgary. The prices are reasonable, the service is great and the sushi is delicious.
Definitely try the Firecracker roll and the Crunch Midori roll, they are both delicious!"}
{"text":"Got the salmon tuna crunch roll last night for take out and it was really good. The only disappointing thing was they forgot the soy sauce. I'll definitely be back for more soon."}
{"text":"Save your $ and dont get any ramen. Its the same as the one you can buy at grocery stores. 

But the sushi is good!"}
{"text":"Had a favorable experience at Midori. Found it a very cozy little restaurant with a nice 17th Ave urban vibe. Enjoyed the convenience of having a variety of sushi sets to make ordering quick and easy, such as the couple sets. 

This place is really fast. The order was ready in about 5 minutes even though the restaurant was full and there was only one server and one chief. Interesting!  

They also have a small Korean section on the menu that needs to be sampled, an intriguing reason to come back next time. 

In my opinion, it isn't the best place in Calgary for sushi. However, it certainly is satisfying and rather close to me. On a sushi craving day when I'm feeling lazy to travel elsewhere, it would be the right fit."}
{"text":"When my roommate told me that Midori Japanese Cafe was the best sushi outside of Vancouver, I didn't believe him.  That's why I made him take me there and take care of the bill.

Don't tell him that I told you this, but I think I have to agree.  The tiny (and I mean tiny) sushi joint is easily Calgary's best kept secret when it comes to all things Japanese.

The must haves include The Double Crunch ( ($11.95) and the standard but delectable California Roll ($5.50). And you would be missing out if you didn't try the Butterfly Roll ($11.95)

Also, if a tiny restaurant isn't your thing, their take-out is stupidly fast. You can call them and go and pick it up and they'll have it ready for you almost immediately. It is like they can read your mind!  They can't, can they?"}
{"text":"Great sushi restaurant! Prices are reasonable, sushi is fresh and the rolls are tasty. Service is fast. It has a patio for people watching on 17th ave. Solid."}
{"text":"We don't normally eat downtown a lot because of how expensive it tends to be, but we were short on time, needed something relatively quick and not overly-filling, and spotted this place.   For fun, we thought it would be a good idea to share a couple of rolls and a pot of tea, so we went in.  It was quiet, we were really the only people in there but it was early afternoon so the lunch rush was over.  That worked for us, sometimes we like it quiet.

We ordered Gyoza, the Crab Salad roll, the Alaska roll, and the Fire Cracker roll for sharing.  The tea was light, flavourful and very hot.  The funny thing was the cups kept trying to walk across the table from the little bit of moisture on the bottom breaking the friction between cup and table surface, so they would glide a little.  Brief amusement while we waited for our food. 

The gyoza were delicious.  They were very fresh, delicious and the sauce had some sort of a sweet vinegar hit to it that was amazing.  The crab salad rolls were fresh crab, love the crispy tempura bits throughout, and the hint of spiciness was perfect.  The Alaska roll is one I normally shy away from but in this case the fish was fresh and delicious, had a really nice smokiness, and the avocado was just right.  My favourite was the Fire Cracker roll, not as spicy as I would have imagined from the ingredients listed but it was a different kind of spice from the crab salad rolls.  The Fire Cracker ones were crunchy and delicious with an awesome heat to them.

Honestly I'd eat all of those again any time!  Next time we're in the area I wouldn't mind trying a few of their other rolls as well."}
{"text":"I used to work a block down, and Midori was my favorite place to go when I wanted to treat myself to sushi for lunch. As I discovered last night, they don't take reservations, but they've got an excellent patio for Puppy Watching. That alone deserves a star or two :).

Minus half a point, because I ordered an \"Avocado and Spinach Goma Salad\" and there was no spinach to be had. It was tasty though, and I love the hell out of Avocado, so I didn't send it back. Minus another half, because I was out of tea and the service was slow so I only got a glass of water at the very end of my meal. Aside from those two things; the food was all wonderful, and I really enjoyed the Yam Tempura and the Avocado and Yam Tempura roll...

(Can you tell I tend to be one track minded at sushi restaurants? Put yams, avocados and deep fried things in front of me and I'll be in love with your restaurant in a hot minute.)

Really glad we were able to enjoy sushi and sunshine (and PUPPIES!) before the crazy hailstorm last night! Bonus points for the free impromptu ~ A Very Loud Man Talks On His Cellphone ~ show that took place behind us."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5
Service: 2.5/5
Overall experience: 3.5/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

Who knew this little hole in the wall had tasty yet decently priced sushi (considering it is located on 17 ave). I drove past this place several times and I thought it was this ghetto little shop with poor/okay quality sushi, which happens to be the case in Calgary. However, I was very mistaken. It's not ghetto, but it is fairly small, boasting only about 15 or so seats. There are tiny booths against the wall and a few chairs at the sushi counter where you can observe the chef making your sushi. 

The decor was nothing special. A typical low brow Japanese restaurant with a large mural of a pagoda and pictures of their 'special sushi rolls' plastered around the restaurant. I found the sushi pictures on the wall sort of helpful, but pointless at the same time since I couldn't see them all at once. Our server was a quiet young girl who attended to us when we needed it. It kind of bugged me that she didn't mention we had to go up and pay so we ended up sitting around for 15 min after eating, waiting for the bill to come. 

Unlike most Japanese places I've been too, there are no order sheets. You tell the waitress what you want while she feverishly writes it down by hand. I find this cumbersome especially if I just want to order a few pieces of sushi, or with a large group. There was surprisingly only 1 chef making sushi but he was very quick to prepare our meal considering I went with a group of 6 people. 

Their menu consists of your usual Japanese fair of miso soup, terikyaki, Yakisoba noodles, ramen, udon, bento boxes, and a variety of rolls. They also have a small Korean menu (Bul-go-gi, Bibimbap, Jap-chae) which was very interesting to see and may warrant another visit.

I ended up ordering sashimi which costs about the same as other places, but the quality of the fish was top notch (no fishy taste) and they gave generous portions. I tried their tuna and salmon ($1.80/$1.90), Toro ($2.70), Hamachi ($3.00), and Butter fish ($3.00) which was new to me. Loved it all especially the Butter fish which is a white fish with a light, creamy texture. 

Their traditional rolls start at around $5.00-$6.00 and their \"special\" rolls are a little over $11. My friends ordered their: spicy tuna and spicy salmon (8 pieces of each), Dragon Roll ($11.95), Valentine Roll, and Fire Cracker Roll (tempura, hot pepper, sour cream, and smoked salmon). The portion of the sushi roll pieces were average (a little more than a loonie in diameter), but it was made well. Many of their special rolls had tempura in it and drenched in sauce which I don't enjoy as much. 

My other friend also ordered their Bento Special (about $16) which is enough to put you in food coma. There was salad, soup, rice, beef/chicken teriyaki, gyoza, half a roll and about 5 pieces of nigiri.. give or take. He said it was pretty good. 

Midori is definitely worth a visit! Their sashimi is fresh and the portions are decently proportioned for the price. The sushi rolls tasted good (nothing out of the ordinary) and the size was \"fair\". I will definitely come back to try the rest of their menu and sample more of their sushi!"}
{"text":"Midori is great! Sushi is one thing we can get pretty particular about and people get fairly loyal to their spots so it's tough to please everyone but Midori is the closest I've seen to being universally liked in Calgary!"}
{"text":"I like you and your crunchy rolls midori, you don't measly shove a tiny bit of tempura shrimp inside a roll and call it crunchy. Instead, you shovel a whack of fried tempura bits over a sushi roll. That gives me an idea that the next time I buy sushi on the go, I'll crunch up some shrimp flavored chips and roll my California rolls around it.

I also liked the savory gyozas you whipped up. But for the price I paid for seaweed salad means I should get a bowl full of seaweeds, not half filled with generic salads. Oh well I needed room for sushi anyways.

It sort of took forever to pay though. But our wait wasn't as bad as the 30 minute wait you put an obnoxious hipster couple through. For that I'm actually rewarding you with one star.

Prices are fair. Location is prime. You're all right Midori, you're a pass in my books."}
{"text":"I love trying new sushi places and finding out they're good! Midori had a decent selection, quite well-priced and very tasty. My butterfish and scallops were a bit frozen, but all-in-all it was very good. I'd definately go back. 

On a side but still important note, the washroom was very clean."}
{"text":"Great tasting combos and unique dishes . Service was good . Downfall is its so small but if you get there early you will be happy with what you will get ! Nice and quiet so you can converse . Great place"}
{"text":"If you're looking for fast, inexpensive Japanese fare, this is the place to go. Their hot dishes are always served piping hot, and the ingredients are of high quality. 

My favorite dish is their beef teriyaki udon. It's a plate of thinly sliced beef teriyaki with a bowl of udon soup to dip it in. The beef is served sizzling at your table, and the sauce is sublime.

Here's another interesting thing about this restaurant: I don't think I've had a Coke that tasted so delicious in my entire life. Maybe it's because the can they give you is near-freezing, or maybe it's the tumbler full of ice they serve it with, but I don't think you can have a glass of Coke anywhere that's better than this. Seriously. Try it."}
{"text":"After waiting 30 mins for food... I received only what i can describe as fried rice balls. I couldn't even find the fillings which Gould have been salmon shrimp and mango. All I could see and taste is rice covered in sauce to disguise the absence of seafood."}
{"text":"Nice, small and quiet sushi bar. Sushi was average, but definitely not bad. Crunch Madori Roll was interesting and tasty. Staff were very nice an quick to serve. I would come again."}
{"text":"This is a Korean-owned place making Japanese food, and I feel that we have been positively ripped-off. I don't care how great some of their premiere items are, if you can't stand behind all of the dishes you are featuring you should not be serving them- and if you do serve it, you should simply not deserve a good review.

The damage:
$10 for what is literally, a bowl of instant noodles you can pick up at T&T for 0.50 plus frozen vegetables and four pity-skewers of yam, shrimp and overcooked chicken. Horrendous. I could have made a better package (because I would have bought a better tasting package. They probably picked the Curry Doll Noodle brand) in 3 minutes. It took them 20 to bring it out. For $10 I'd expect at least the decency to throw in a second bag, but they obviously only put one tiny 50 cent bag in.

$13 for obviously frozen packaged udon with the same frozen vegetables and a few pieces of grilled protein. How hard is it to make udon and add store-bought soup base and toss in some vegetables? Another 3 minute dish that took forever, and tasted like it only took 30 seconds to make. Also, extremely tiny. Clearly it was just a bag.

$7 for brown rice with toasted seaweed and spinach. Except they didn't have spinach, and didn't even have the courtesy to tell us - so here's a small bowl of random packaged Korean seaweed that probably was $1 for an entire package that could have been used in 20 plates of this.

There are loads of better Japanese places; yes even in Calgary, you don't have to run to Vancouver. The reviews horribly mislead us to waste $35 here, and I'm inclined most of the reviewers here have never really tried any good Japanese food to know any better.

I'd feel bad because the service is actually decently nice, if tragically slow."}
{"text":"I don't eat as often as I should, Midori is down the street from work and I have made a promise to myself to eat here more. All the rolls are great, my favorite being the double crunch, the sashimi is awesome, always had a great experience."}
{"text":"Midori is a great place for sushi in Calgary. It's hard to find somewhere with decent sushi without paying an arm and a leg but Midori is one of the best I've found so far. I really like the \"crunch\" rolls (although the tempura bits cannot be good for you). The Caterpillar roll is my favourite so far, I think.

My only complaint is that they never refill water... so service is a little lacking. I drink a lot of water; when I drain the glass within the first 10 mins, a refill might be nice. Soy sauce is salty! And when everyone at the table is in need of water, definitely an indicator!

All in all, I'll be back, though. A place definitely worth a visit (or 2)"}
{"text":"It's tiny, and the exterior looks a bit tired, but their combo dinner with two small skewers of chicken, miso soup, mixed green salad, seaweed salad, four pieces of nigiri, and four California rolls made a satisfying early evening meal for me on a Friday evening right after work. They do take reservations by phone, so if you want a table, make sure to phone ahead, else you'll have to sit at the sushi bar."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 3 stars because it's not the most enchanting venue, but the sushi was very yum. A nicer selection of wines and beverages would be great. Ultimately a casual or take-out joint kind of place. I came here on a date and I don't think it was particularly conducive to romance :P"}
{"text":"I've walked past this place many times but never given it a second thought, I tend to stick with my usual sushi spots but we had a craving and the Yelp reviews brought us to Midori. Not much on the outside, small but ample space on the inside. I do like the 'patio' outside, it's different for a sushi joint. There were a couple other tables and bunch of take out orders, so we figured it was probably a popular spot. We ordered Tempura Udon, Seaweed Salad, Spicy Crunch Salmon, and Valentine Rolls. All were delicious! The fish was really fresh and we were really full afterwards. The lady working the till & serving was very sweet and accommodating. I would definitely return to Midori in the future if I had a sushi craving while on 17th Ave!"}
{"text":"I've been learning to like sushi, but Midori might very well have me falling in love with it if I keep spoiling my tastebuds with the sushi-tastic rolls and dishes I found here.  

With limited seating available, the best choice for Midori Sushi is to phone in your order ahead for takeout.  We walked in off the street and there was a steady stream of people picking up orders while we waited.  Although if you're not sure what you're in for from the menu, being on location can help with pictures of each of the dishes lining the wall to give you an idea.

If you're not sure what to try... introduce yourself to the yam roll.  Super tasty and with a bit of crunch, this one is by far my favourite."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in awhile and went back for dinner tonight. 
The food was awesome and I found everything to be fairly priced.
Try the firecracker roll it's delish!!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Midori, and until I discovered a few sushi places even closer to my apartment, this has always been my go to spot. Since high school, actually, when I would be in the city and searching for a little nook to curb my sushi cravings. 
They have a few fantastic vegetarian options, which makes the livin' eeeeeeasy for Sarah Louise. However, sometimes if I ask for something such as a cucumber and avocado roll TOGETHER, they want to charge me for one of their more expensive options sans meat, which doesn't particularily make any sense to me. So I end up having them separate and wishing I could combine the two. 
I love to eat on the patio here. Also, the rice is always pretty impeccable, which is something that I am very picky about. The miso soup is alright, and this place was my first introduction to real Genmaicha tea. Solid.

(23/30)"}
{"text":"Synopsis: was looking for ramen, but this other place closed at 2:30pm. Looked for alternatives on Yelp - this placed turned up. 
Spicy tuna roll = 4
Ramen w/pot stickers = 2
Tempura udon = 3.

When I think of ramen, I think of a shoyu or pork broth with made-from-scratch (I think I'm spoiled) noodles. What was had here was in the neighborhood of Top Ramen and major disappointment. At least my son's tempura udon was done right."}
{"text":"This restaurant can be hard to spot as it's a small cafe but judging from the number of people that constantly came in, I could tell it's a favourite amongst people.  Inside there just a few booths and seating by the counter and we were lucky to snag the booth right by the door around noon.  The waitress came by with menus and it took some time for our tea to arrive.

Since I wasn't very hungry, I ordered the teriyaki chicken rice and miso soup to share with a colleague.  My other colleagues ordered the sushi, with chicken or beef, rice, and salad.  The food took a little long to arrive so it's not ideal if you want a quick lunch.  I like the rice and decent number of pieces of chicken.  The sauce wasn't overwhelming and just enough tang to give it good taste.

Our meals all came to about $14 including tea.  I would certainly come here for take out if there were no seats for eating in or I didn't have time to wait as it was about an hour we were in the restaurant.  Next to try is the sushi!"}
{"text":"I've always liked Midori. I think it was the first restaurant/cafe that I went to when I first ventured down 17th Ave as a young highschool fleeing the suburbs on a Saturday. Back then, going for sushi downtown felt pretty grown-up. My 17 year-old self was struck by, what I perceived as, the authenticity of the place and more importantly, the low prices and good sushi.

Midori has stayed mostly the same. There is still the sort of Japan kitsch decor, the prices are low, but have increased slightly, and the menu is more-or-less the same.

I still think that Midori is the go-to place for well-priced, and delicious sushi. If I recall correctly, it's also locally owned by a Calgary family, and certainly, the service is Calgarian; efficient and polite."}
{"text":"Always a good experience. Seating outside in the summer to have lunch or dinner and people watch is something everyone should do once in a while on 17 Avenue."}
{"text":"I actually enjoy Midori. It's quite small, but it doesn't discount the food. It's fairly busy during peak times, but considering its so close to where I live, I don't mind taking it to go. The staff is super friendly and the sushi is always fresh! They have original rolls which is mucho importante to me because I don't like getting just \"salmon rolls\". I always like trying something new and love how they have pictures posted on the walls that leave me drooling over which roll to try. Haha. 

Another great feature is that they are open throughout the day. It's not one of those 2-3 hour stints till you wait till the dinner rush! Greatly appreciated by those who have inconsistent meal times. Anyways, although Midori doesn't look particularly visually appetizing on the exterior, the food is great!"}
{"text":"We had decided to get take-out as we didn't feel like spending time in a restaurant.  We ordered the Combo, an extra order of tempura (assorted) and two pieces of creamy scallop.  The take out menu which we had from months past said it would be about $50.  We ordered and they said it would be 30 minutes.

We arrived about 35 minutes later and the food still wasn't ready so we had a seat.  Immediately the lady puts a sign saying their CC/interac machine was not working so it was cash only.  OK, so we went for a walk, came back and our food was ready.  It came out to $60.  When looking at the new menu the prices had gone up.  Oh well... it happens.

The miso soup was well.. miso soup.  I think I've never successfully been able to tell any kind of miso soup apart.  The salad was nice and fresh with a ponzu / soy sauce type dressing that was delish.

Our sushi was just OK.  I've had much much better for the same price.  It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't amazing.  The rolls were the right size.  The rice was a bit overcooked in my opinion.  I'm not sure if it was a matter of it being in a take-out container, but our rice kept falling apart.

I'd be willing to go back just to see if they could do better."}
{"text":"This place is ok... Is not the worst sushi I have had in town, but is not the best either... I would say if you are walking by.. Or close to the area and don't want to go far, is ok to go there, But if you really want a good sushi; you should go somewhere else..."}
{"text":"Absolutely lovely little cafe. Attentive, kind service with absolutely KILLER sushi!! Big fan of the spicy tuna crunch roll and the red tuna sashimi. Left happy and full!"}
{"text":"On my first visit I was not expecting anything spectacular since sushi has become a generic option these days but this place actually makes GREAT SUSHI! And I really like the staff."}
{"text":"When the sushi craving hits me and my boyfriend like Jaws slamming into the bottom of your glass boat, we call up Midori.

When we were first acquainted with this little treat, we kept trying to eat in at the restaurant and I was amazed at how many people came in to pick up their order while I was still waiting for my tea to reach the table.

For Midori's service is slow, so phone ahead, place your winning order: ours includes miso soup, all vegetable tempura, tuna and salmon sashimi combo and 2 yam flake rolls (one each) and stride on in 20 -30 minutes later and waving your method of payment, while trying not to cringe at the waitress taking 5-10 minutes to get the drink orders on her tray.

But I forgive your slow table service Midori, because I have learned to beat the system. Your food is delicious, though your debit/credit machine reminds me of trying to connect to the internet back in 96."}
