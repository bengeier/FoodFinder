{"text":"My family and I have a tradition to have pizza almost every Friday. In the last few years or more, the quality of pizza has declined.  We tried Jilliano's pizza for the first time last week and we loved it!!!!!!! They serve the best pizza in this area! Thank you Jilliano's for your great service and superb pizza! You have given back what we have been missing, DELICIOUS Pizza!!! Truly Thankful, The Scott's"}
{"text":"I last reviewed Jilliano's 2 years ago.  We haven't ordered it as much the last year or so because of the Marco's PTO nights.  We ordered a few months ago and I didn't really like it but my husband still did.  We ordered again last night and something seemed different, even my husband didn't like it.  Usually I just stick with the cheesy bread because the pizza sauce is too sweet for me but even that tasted different.  Like they started using cheaper ingredients or something.  It just didn't taste very good and it's the most expensive pizza place we go to.  Think we'll be moving on.   3 stars because my kids ate it and no one got sick so that's positive!  Lastly, and I hate to judge a restaurants food by their staff, but every time I've ever ordered, whoever answers the phone and takes the order sounds as if I'm ruining their day.  Not rude or anything just annoyed that I've called.  If they had online ordering I would order that way just so I didn't have to call and bother anyone"}
{"text":"Omg...finally, found my new #pizzahome! Pizza done right. From the prices, hospitality and food, Jilliano's is on the money... I think I can speak on behalf of most pizza lovers, we like toppings \"to the edge\". Thnx, Jilliano's! #pizzaexperts #satisfiedcustomer"}
{"text":"My son and I went in here for lunch one day and stood there for several minutes and even though the girl looked at us, she never said a word, she even walked outside to bring food to the only other customers there, and ignored us.  Needless to say, we left without ordering anything."}
