{"text":"Just got the nicely nicelys pizza and a large fry. Pizza is amazing. Juicy flavorful chicken yummy mushrooms and big chunks of garlic. Ingredients were so good. Crust was perfect too.  Fries are just regular crinkle ones but atleast they were good! First time for delivery will atleast once a week!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite cravings spots for sandwiches. I've tried quite a few of them and have yet to be disappointed by any. Their pizza looks great but I haven't personally tried one but based on these other reviews I may have to check a couple of those out too. Not to mention one of my favorite desserts is right in the same shopping center."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill significantly, sadly!!!  When we lived in this part of town some years back, we ate here occasionally, the pizza & service was always decent, good enough to enjoy once in awhile.  Then we moved across town so we didn't go as often, it wasn't convenient.  Over the past few years, the few times we went, it was okay... the sauce seemed different, but it was okay... good enough to eat, nothing to get excited about.  So we didn't go for quite some time.  The one thing that was always... always the same, when we ordered pepperoni, each square slice had 3 or 4 pieces of pepperoni on it.  Each time, we'd say \"dang, next time we need to order double pepperoni\" because I like lots more on my slices.  But we always forgot to order it that way.
A couple of weeks ago, we were trying to decide what to eat, and I thought of Nathan's... we decided to give them another try, since it had been quite a while.  I actually remembered about the pepperoni this time, so we ordered a medium with DOUBLE pepperoni & light sauce... nothing else.
Our pizza arrives... with 4 pieces of pepperoni on each slice... umm double??  But worse, the cheese was overpowering, it was like triple the normal amount of cheese.  When we said something, they argued & said \"That IS double\" and when we asked about the cheese, he said \"Yeah, I put on extra cheese for you\"... WHY?  We didn't ask for \"extra\" cheese, we don't LIKE a TON of cheese!   I said \"this is not double, unless you've cut way back to only 2 pieces on each slice... we've always gotten 3-4 pieces per slice... this is nowhere near double. Paying for double should have had at least 5-6 pieces of pepperoni per slice.  The cook was very rude, took the pizza, grabbed a huge handful of cold pepperoni and dumped it all over the pizza... so now we had way too much, and it wasn't cooked into the pizza at all.  Because of being loaded down with cheese, it didn't taste too great either... all we could taste was cheese.  We ate just enough so we weren't starving anymore, and we  left the rest.
Extremely disappointing visit... each time over the years has gotten worse, but this was the very worst!  Really bad service and terrible pizza!  They should have offered to re-make the pizza with the correct cheese & correct pepperoni, or refunded our money, they could have at the very least apologized... but no, they just get nasty & rude!  Very sad... they used to be a good, family run place... now just rude people making wrong pizzas and then they refuse to fix them when they screw up.  We won't be back again, they've used up their second & third chances, each time worse than the last."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the world! Knowing that the pizzas are made daily and done by hand is what makes it more delicious. I'm usually craving this place. I'd probably gain some weight but totally worth it lol"}
{"text":"Was here Sunday night for dinner.  I decided to try it because I had a gift certificate from Restaurant.com and I heard it was good pizza.  The restaurant is on the corner of Lake Mead and Buffalo next to smash burger.  Inside is pretty cool. They have a bar and booth seating with the walls decorated in Detroit sports stuff, and theres like at least 10 nice flat screens all over and a giant projector screen.  Most had the sunday games on, 1 had the nascar race, and 1 even had cartoon network (there were a couple tables with kids). 

So when you arrive you order at the window and just find a seat anywhere with your number. The fountain drinks are self service, I didn't order any beer so I'm not sure how the tab for that goes. (Too bad they aren't self service...amirite?)  Anyway we ordered a large appetizer sampler and a tri sampler pizza. The pizza is 9 squares and you can get 4 toppings of w/e on each row of 3. Pretty cool for sampling.  I got one with chicken bacon garlic and onion and it was the shit. Along with our 2 fountain drinks and minus my gift certificate, we ended up paying 20 bucks, or 10 each.  

The food was enough for 2 EXTREMELY hungry people, or like 4 people that are normal. The appetizer sampler was a bed of crinkle fries with 4 huge onion rings, 4 shrimp poppers, 4 chicken wings, 4 chicken tenders, 4 mozzarella sticks. I think thats it.  The onion rings are tasty but the onion was very thick cut.  Everything else was kind of standard fare.  The pizza was very good. Not extremely greasy and the toppings are good quality. The crust had a nice crunch to it as well. 

I'll be back if I'm in the area for sure because its good food and good value."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of  great Chicago style pizza from Gino's or a New York style pizza pie from Ray's on 7th st.,but Detroit pizza can certainly hold it's own. Northside Nathan's is clearly underrated. The Motor -city style pizza is not round but square with a nice thin layer of tomato sauce followed by a great loving portion of cheese. Add whatever toppings you want to keep it simple or check out their signature pizza like the \"Guys & Dolls\" or the \"Gangsters Choice.\" If you aren't a pizza fan (which I don't see why you wouldn't be) make sure you check out the rest of their menu! My own vital tip is beware repping other teams at Northside Nathans. The decor is all Detrioit 24/7! Tiger, Lions, Wolverines oh my!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza and salad just can't believe the prices are so high.  $20 for a medium and $11.00 for a salad."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service. Salads are always fresh and the pizza... Not only looks amazing but also is the way pizza should taste. Service is always with a smile. This place has been a family favorite for many years and will be for many years to come."}
{"text":"Considering I was given a completely different price then what they tried to then charge me double at delivery, I would have to recommend to never order from here. On top of that the staff was completely rude and could care less to apologize or try to rectify the situation.
I truly appreciate that the owner took the time to respond, therefore I am giving you more stars so my review won't hurt your business :)"}
{"text":"I've made it a tradition; any time I'm in Vegas I have to eat here. Best pizza/wings in town, absolutely love coming to this place."}
{"text":"This place is really good. I went here right after coming back from Detroit MI and it was like I fell into a pizza parlor right where I was. My fiancee is from Detroit and this instantly became our favorite hang out."}
{"text":"Pizza hot all the way until the end?  Never experienced that before.  Excellent pizza, very good wings and great mozzarella sticks...We were pleasantly surprised as last few pizza places up Northside here have disappointed.  I would recommend this pizza for sure..VERY NICE."}
{"text":"gotta say... consistent consistent ...

despite other Expert Defensive Yelpers opinions who trust sites like Wikipedia (which is written by other self proclaimed experts)...who know all about what the pizza scene is like in Detroit I say to you this.......

square rectangle round and even heart shaped pizza can be found a plenty out there...the deep pan is a Chicago thing that is sprinkled around in Detroit area.. these guys do it square and the pan style was super fresh and had a great great great crust like normal. 

Latest try was Sky Masterson... Anti Pasta (bit too acidic for me but huge portion nonetheless)  This personal pan was so so good.  

Just wish there were more herbs going on to intensify the flavors - the sauce is just a smidge too sweet on each tray but I understand why they do it.. this is def a kids/family spot.

Thanks NN Pizza for taking me home!"}
{"text":"Best pizza&salad.... family friendly. Great music. Fun game for the kids... several tv ' s to watch!"}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing... truly grand. Generous with ingredients and terribly fresh! Love it. The downside is that it's very dark and you'll have tiny children running around your table (yeah, it's always like that), but well worth it for the handmade and truly fabulous food. Reasonable, too!"}
{"text":"This place was great.  Not sure if they got a new owner or a cheap one.  Could tell a difference in food quality, and they had the shittest forks!  If that cheap bastard bought those forks, he needs to get out of the industry.  So I recommend, if you want good food go somewhere else. Want a good laugh, go in and see the forks!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Love it. Even though im from Chicago and this is a detroit place, they have really good pizza and wings. My friends and I ordered nicely nicely and gangsta choice pizzas. We also got onion rings and wings as well. It is a small place but I love that they always show all different sports on the tv's."}
{"text":"This use to be one of my favorite pizza places till it took over an hour for my Delivery to get to me and then they charged my credit card and when it got to me they tried to make me pay cash when I already paid. I'm not happy with the service I have received from them and this will be the last time I order from them. I don't feel it is Appropriate to charge your customers twic"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for 15 years and still love it! I used to live down the block and someone introduced me to this great joint - I quickly became an addict! I love that it's family owned - Todd is always a joy to run into and his beloved father even made our lunch deliveries to the office back in the day. I have yet to eat anything here that I didn't like - salads, subs, chicken, pizza - love it all!  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza ole skool video games bring you back to simple days a decimate eat In place"}
{"text":"This review is more for their customer service than their food although their pizza is excellent and so are their salads. But I wanted to leave a review about their customer service.  I placed an order for delivery I accidentally clicked pick up. I wasn't able to go pick up the order and when I called they told me that it was going to be an hour and a half before they could deliver it because of so many deliveries of head of mine. I said that's fine I would just save the pizzas for the next day I needed to make my kids dinner and they didn't want to wait any longer.  I felt bad because my order had been sitting there for 20 minutes due to my mistake and I was wondering where it was. And then I saw on my email saying it was ready for pick up.  I was a little bummed that my pizza wasn't gonna show up until two hours after it's made. However, It was delivered 10 minutes after I hung up. The pizzas were still hot the salad was still fresh everything was delicious. So they went above and beyond to deliver my order quickly  even though I had made the mistake of clicking pick up I will definitely be ordering from them again great food great service."}
{"text":"I love Northside Nathans. The pizza is great and the chicken wings are crispy and awesome. The garlic ranch is good on both. I wouldnt consider it to be authentic Italian pizza by any means, but it is still really good. They have cheap lunch specials and good prices in general. The employees are always nice and helpful. They have old school arcade games which is pretty fun while you are waiting for your food. It is very family friendly."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time and I really didn't think the pizza was that great. I did really like the chicken wings though. They were nice and crispy which is the way I like them. I would go back for the wings."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The best pizza I've had so far in Las Vegas. The wings are flavorful but not very juicy. I will be returning as I had the vegi deep dish and it was delightful."}
{"text":"It's good pizza, really big servings.  I definitely recommend sitting inside and taking in the whole 80's vibe.  They even have vintage stand-up arcades like the pizzerias of my childhood.  The service is really good.  Staff/owner was really sweet and patient while we went over the very long menu with tons of options.  Already been there twice and will continue to come.  Glad my friend recommended it."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 pizzas and a Caesar salad for the office and they were all appreciated.  The Guys and Dolls had a generous amount of toppings.  It took no time to finish all of that pizza.  The Nicely Nicely's also had a super amount of chicken on it.  It was a good value for the money and I will be ordering from them again.  One constructive criticism is that the large salad that is portioned for 3-4 people isn't that large.  I was expecting more for the $9.35 price."}
{"text":"Stopped in because we'd heard it was a pretty good place and just moved to the area.  I'm honstly mad that I have to been their sooner. This is the best pizza I've ever had!! We got the a meat lovers essentially, I can't remember the name. But it was AMAZING! Pepperoni,  meatball, sausage and bacon. Oh my word.... so good!!! Every bite was like Heaven! The crust was outstanding. Crispy with every bite. Perfect sauce. Can Not Wait To Return!!!  Am recommending to everyone!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm a vegas local and have been looking for a place to call home to watch sports, eat some good grub, and relax. This place reminds me of many cozy sports bars I've been to in the central north and Northeast. The staff here are very nice and attentive.
You have to try the Detroit redwings plain! So crispy and reminds me of Texas fried chicken in miniature. The Sky Matterson pizza is awesome too. Good place to watch the Golden Knights!"}
{"text":"Food was good i ordered Sky Masterson which is just like a meat lovers. Tasted good but it wasn't all dat.  Staff is nice and the atmosphere is sports sports sports.  Good place to watch the game. Currently watching 2nd game Spurs vs. Heat.  Lots of tvs and booths and a HUGE tv in the middle.  LET'S GO SPURS!"}
{"text":"Northside Nathan's serves up a very good thick crust pie.  Unfortunately, I could never take my father here since there is Michigan stuff all over the walls and my dad was a big Ohio State fan.

The lunch special is a good value."}
{"text":"This was the first pizza place I tried after moving to Vegas and I have been hooked since. I don't usually choose thick crust pizzas any where but the thick crust is amazing here. We now frequent this restaurant at least once a month. We have only had the thick crust pizza, cheese bread, salads, and wings. The wings are the best because they come without sauce and everyone can dump as much hot sauce on that they want so there is no arguing over how spicy to order them.

My favorite part is that you order up at the counter and fill your own drinks. You don't have a waitress coming by and bothering you and you can hang out and watch one of the 10 TVs as long as you want. Northside Nathan's has definitely become our pizza out place. We have never ordered for delivery. I wouldn't want to with this place."}
{"text":"We've been going to Northside for years...great pizza, medium-thick crust Detroit style, with a crispy crust when it comes out hot from the oven.  If you like thin crust you can order one too.  Their salads are fresh and crisp and the ranch dressing gets rave reviews from my kids.  The staff claims they make the ranch fresh everyday from scratch.  Great chicken fingers and their fries are always good.  They have sandwiches and pasta too but the pizza is their forte.  It's one of the few mom and pop places here in Vegas that is truly homemade and delicious."}
{"text":"Service is friendly and accurate. I been inhaling their pizza for years now.  The vegetarian is the best I ever tasted. Their home made ranch is to die for! The salads are huge! And the fries are worth the wait. I definitely recommend this place. Great food!"}
{"text":"Good pizza.  I really like their black olive pizza.  Their sandwiches are
good.  I like the Edsel (hot ham and cheese).  If you order fries with this have them hold the lettuce and tomato as they make the fries mushy on deliveries."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time with this shithole. They do not deliver after 8pm but they are open till 10pm. I called around 9:30pm to place an order for pickup and no answer. I called 6 times but they refused to answer the phone. Some places will never be great with this kind of customer service. 

STAY AWAY!!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. Above average service. Dine in or carry out, I love this establishment! It's a pizza joint mixed with a midwest sports bar. The pizza crust has a very distinct yet delicious flavor. A friend of mine has an aversion to cheese but loves everything else about pizza (cheeseless pizza, I know, weird). The fact that we can order a 4x4 pizza with one quarter cheeseless, and they get it right every time, is a big reason it is our go to spot whenever we want pizza. The staff is always accommodating and will even refill your drinks for you at their self serve soda fountain so you don't have to get up. If you're looking for great pizza and and a great place to relax with friends, head over to Northside Nathan's. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Cool little place on the northwest side of town! Husband took me here after coming with his friend a whole back. The place feels super homey & is full of memorabilia & fun decorations all in honor of Detroit. You order at the window & they deliver to your table. Not much seating, but we came at a time when it wasn't busy at all. Vending machines & a few simple arcade games line up by the front door so you have stuff to do while waiting. 

We ordered four piece chicken tenders that came with fries & ranch. We also got a regular 13 inch pizza that had all the meats on it. You can tell the food was fresh because it was super hot! Always a good thing. They have a bar with beers & a some wines, I believe. It's serve yourself fountain drinks & iced tea. Everything was so good & greasy, YUM!

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Always the best pizza. And I'm obsessed with their fries. I got the veggie pizza and added pepperoni. Even better when you find a way to save a few bucks!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best wings in town! Crispy and delicious! Pizza is great as well. Only gave 4 stars rather than 5 because they are a bit pricey. Decent dine in area for families equipped with arcade games."}
{"text":"Have never been disappointed with this establishment. Personal size pizza (4 small slices) was exactly enough to go with an order of wings. The wings were meaty and perfectly cooked. I highly recommend if you just want good old fashioned pizza and wings !!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre to bad - try Rocco's - don't waste your money here. Jeez, I'd almost go to Pizza Hut first."}
{"text":"Sorry, pizza was terrible...Owner change...Pizza is not ITALIAN...Nice setting, higher priced than before...Detroit Pizza is listed on menu...If you ever had a Detroit style pizza, this was not. A lot of there help does not speak English."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Love the pizza, love their crinkle cut fries with ranch. Happy 4th Nathan's, bringing wings to aunts house."}
{"text":"Decent but not great. Pizza wasn't spectacular, but it was different, and the atmosphere was all right. I would consider watching sports there next time over steiners or roadrunner. Lots of TVs, but I would be concerned they only watch detroit."}
{"text":"I have got to say my visit was pleasant . Well it was short but the staff was friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was nice .
I ordered the Cristina salad and derp dish pepperoni and sausage and onions with extra jalopenos. 
My first time here ever and I just wanted to taste the pizza .. pizza was ok.. the salad was amazing , I came home and ended up eating more of the salad than the pizza. 
Pizza was good.. just too salty for me .
I'd still go back and order more food though"}
{"text":"Forget about the pizza, I am here for the wings. Nowhere have I found better! Your classic vision of hot wings can remain buckled in the car, because Nathans is serving up a mini version of deep fried chicken! Plain, crispy, thick n' juicy wings that you'll have to squirt the hot sauce on yourself...but don't bother, instead dredge them in their ranch dressing which is full of garlic!

Not only did the wings get dunked, but I smothered my pan-style pizza crust in their ranch as well. So much so that I left with offensive breath and a garlic hangover the next morning that I (almost happily) couldn't shake. 

Pros:
*Very casual dining, neat décor, the pizza cheese is the kind that actually strings about  2 feet when you serve a slice, lil' bar in the back, DID I MENTION WINGS?

Cons:
* Very casual dining, terrible music, lack of pizza sauce and minimal toppings, french fries are too identical to Ore Ida, first timers aren't so sure where/what to do (ex: place order at window, grab silverware, sit down)."}
{"text":"THE best pizza place in town!!!! It's a little pricey, but it's my special pizza treat. The ranch is to die for too."}
{"text":"First time eating here. The cashier told me that I have to try their wings. I was very satisfied with his recommendation. The food took a little longer than expected, but they had a variety of shows to entertain me. Will be back in the future!"}
{"text":"Thanks but no thanks for your reply as we won't patronize a place that does not stand behind it's gift certificates."}
{"text":"I love this place and they do the sicilian pizza right.  The staff does a great job and very friendly."}
{"text":"After wondering for a while if this place was any good I finally got a chance to eat here. The bar/pizza joint was clean and the service was good. The fact that you order and pay at the counter then they give you a number makes it feel more like a fast food eatery, but more and more restaurants are adopting this style of service. We ordered the Downtown Sampler at $14.95 and the 13\"pizza called Greek-Town for $14.50. The food arrived in a timely manner, however the taste of it was average, nothing really outstanding about the food here. But  also nothing is bad about it that's why I give it a three star rating"}
{"text":"Always come here for lunch or early dinner when on this side of town. Live in Henderson, yet drive here to have their amazing Pizza!!! Great fresh flavor!"}
{"text":"Yummy, Yummy, Yummy, pizza and salads.  I haven't had anything else on their menu but it's the best pizza around.  Nice cozy litle restaurant too.  Great place to go.  Penny O'Brien"}
{"text":"Not very impressed with the Detroit style pizza here.  I had high hopes and heard great things about Northside Nathan's.  The pizza was not the way it's made in Detroit.  Crust was too crispy, with no flavor.  It was more on the thinner side than the typical Detroit style crust. They didn't skimp on the toppings and it did have a good amount of sauce and cheese on it.  Problem I'm finding is outside of Detroit most places seem to make the Detroit style pizza crust too crisp.  The crust needs to be crisp with buttery caramelized edges that are soft when you bite into it.   I have been accused of being a pizza snob so maybe I'm overly picky but it didn't do anything for me.  The other people in my group ordered a regular hand tossed pizza and I found that to be better.  Nathan's is decorated with cool Detroit memorabilia and a colorful mural of the city with popular landmarks on the back wall.  I will probably give it another shot since it may have been an off day."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas. The Tri-Quad Sampler is perfect for my family, since everyone gets exactly what they want. Awesome Greek salad too."}
{"text":"The pizza taste very different from how it tasted about 2-3 years ago. Whatever change they made is such a tragic mistake. The only reason they get 2 stars is because the pizza was hot.. But it is very bland with no flavor at all!!!  Also, my medium pepperoni pizza was $17 which I would have no problem paying for something with flavor but their pizza is gross."}
{"text":"Though this is a pizza joint, their salads and wings are surprisingly good, too. 
The Greek salad comes in at under $10 for a huge portion of freshness and flavor, while the Detroit Red Wings are a crispy delight with a side of awesome sauce- literally. They come with a garlic-ranch dressing that must be made in-house because it was incredibly flavorful. In the words of Anthony Bourdain, I'd lick that off of a bicycle seat.*

Other points of interest: they have plenty of beer specials, outdoor seating is available, and phone-in orders are ready fast. 


*Disclaimer: I have no idea if Anthony would agree with me about the sauce."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is gunna hate me for this but, I say their wings are way better than mad onion. Please hear me out before you can start judging me.. I love their wings for it's lightly breaded crust, which is crispy to perfection. And the meat is always tender and juicy for being the dark meat. I guess the only downfall is their prices are moderate for a limited number of wings.

I love ranch, so I guess that makes me a ranch connoisseur. Thus, I love their ranch. It has this garlicy hint to it. I usually mix it with a little bit of the buffalo sauce. And to upgrade my fries, I smother em with parmesan cheese. 

I've never been to Chicago, but it definitely has that kind of vibe. It's great for families and they have huge servings. Not only are the wings great, but their pizza is mighty tasty as well.

Not a lot of people notice this, but there's a huge parking lot in the back. You know, just incase it's packed in the front."}
{"text":"We recently went here for dinner with a group. Ordered the deep dish pizza and truly, it was fantastic! Lots of toppings and cheese. Well done so no doughy taste or uncooked areas. Huge portions and price was excellent. Service was great as well and the servers took great care of us. Sports atmosphere, but not too loud. Highly recommend it! Yum!!"}
{"text":"I've seen this place never went inside. Until a friend told us and took us there for lunch! The wings are amazing! Fresh and crunchy-- ate them all the way to the bones!!!  Their pizza was really good as well. Their crust is the best part, freshly made-- hand delivered to the table.  Decor is old school, cute little place. Lots of Detroit items. Places old school music. Def a hidden little gem. They also have different types of hot sauces go try with the wings too."}
{"text":"This is a great little hole in the wall pizza joint. I went here with my grandma and aunt for dinner. My grandma loves the chicken wings, she says they are the best ever! She ate 11 all by herself!  The pizza was hot and fresh and was good. The salad was ok but nothing special, a little disappointing, but it was good. Overall an enjoyable restaurant. The environment and decorations are great, there was so much to look at."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best pizzas in Vegas!  If you're a fan of thick-crust pizza - not that thin cracker-type California style pizza then this is a place you want to check out!  Good atmosphere and great pizza, family friendly but they do have a limited selection of beers to enjoy along with many TV's showing sports for the adults and cartoons for the kids.  Guys and Dolls is a fantastic pie!!  Great pizza place!!"}
{"text":"First time coming to eat at Northside Nathan's and the food was great. The prices for the pizza and drinks were fair, and the restaurant has a good location. Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"So I was talking with a Co worker about food. I asked him about pizza. He suggested this place without missing a beat. He told me that the pizzas were square! I was all excited. Let me tell you that this place didn't disappoint. The cheese was plenty and gooey and that crust was crunchy I will return."}
{"text":"Love this place. Have tried most of the menu and never disappointed. My favorite pizza on this side of town. Haven't tried a lot of pizza places in town but so far best in town."}
{"text":"I really really would not recommend this place. I came here because they offered deep dish pizza and I've read about Detroit style pizza not too long ago. I thought I'd give it a try. I ordered an 11 inch deep dish pizza with pepperoni and sausage and wings

The pizza is, imo, on the cheaper side (in quality). The sauce isn't very spectacular. It tastes pre-packaged and you cannot taste almost any herbs in the sauce. It also doesn't taste really fresh. I noticed a chunk of dry oregano in the sauce but it didn't seem to add any flavor. The cheese is spread kinda thinly to boot, so you end up tasting more of the bread. It also does not have any particular flavor. Neither the pepperoni or the sausage stood out. Honestly the pepperoni and sausage toppings in Pizza Hut has more flavor. The crust is decent but that's as far as the positives go. The only saving grace for this place was the wings. They're done well but a place that bases its business on pizza shouldn't have better wings than pizza.

 I don't know how they manage to make an awful pizza. It's on par with cafeteria/frozen pizza. Think Tombstone. Red Baron would be a step up above this place.  Go anywhere else. Glazier's grocery store is miles better than this pizza and better too. $7-8 versus $14 for a two person pizza. Sam's Club is better. The gas station pizza at Snacker's is better. Anywhere else but here. Save your money and take your business elsewhere. You'll thank me for it."}
{"text":"Well, it's a pizza joint, with your normal pizza fare. But with items such as \"Detroit wings\" on the menu this place sets itself apart. 

The pizza here is delicious. We've ordered in and takeout (never delivered -so can't comment on that). It's always cooked through, no soggy crust, good toppings, and not super greasy. We usually order the regular deep dish style, but they also offer a thin crust. The wings are served naked and crispy, but come w a tasty wing sauce on the side. The wing sauce is a nice addition to you pizza too. Sandwiches are served here, which I can't vouch for firsthand, but I've been assured are quite good as well. They have a bar, where you can get cheap beer to wash down that pizza pie. 

The service is minimal, but acceptable here. Order at the counter and pay. They'll bring your food to you. Self serve drinks, plates, etc. And they will clean the table. I like this type of service for a joint like this, as they wont dote on you. Just grab your pizza and beer and have some dinner. 

Added bonuses: arcade games in restaurant such as ms pac man. And next door is pink box donuts, open 24 hrs. So you can get your sweet tooth on or pick up tomorrow's breakfast after dinner!"}
{"text":"I'd say... average. 

I kind of feel like they're confused about whether they're a sit down or fast(ish) food place. 

You walk in and are right at the register/ordering counter. You place your order, pay, and sit to wait for your food. We didn't wait terribly long - about average for pizza - and were brought our meal to the table. The server didn't seem very pleasant when at our table - she was a little cold/curt when speaking to us. She did come around and refill the drinks a couple times and then was at another table with a friendlier tone and taking orders? It was a bit weird. 

I got a pretty simple pepperoni and sausage pizza, can't remember what Hubs got. I couldn't finish mine and got a box to go - but honestly didn't end up eating it later. It just wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Nothing special. If my girlfriend would go to round table I would rather go there. This place is to expensive for what it is. Windy city is way better"}
{"text":"Pizza is not bad, but loud music will drive you out of this place"}
{"text":"Being originally from Michigan, this is one of the best pizza places I can find here in Las Vegas.  I have been to both locations (the other is on Flamingo & Fort Apache) and both are delicious!  This location is bigger with a bar, where the other location is MUCH smaller and no bar.  Even though I prefer round-shaped pizza (and I'm pretty sure almost every pizza place in Michigan is round-shaped) this square pizza is the only I will eat!

Our friends that are originally from Las Vegas love it too!

We also get their Caesar Salad- which is good.  Salad & Pizza- can it get any better?  

Its definitely a casual place, refill your own drinks, but they serve your food and they clean up your table when you leave.  You never feel rushed and you could hang out for a while.

They also deliver!

If you don't want the regular chain pizza (Pizza Hut makes me ill!) then this is the place to try!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza was deep dish tomato and garlic. They always heaped the toppings on and it was fun eating a square pizza. :)"}
{"text":"Just ordered a large thin crust pep, sausage, mushrooms and black olives and got here it a large pepperoni. I swear I repeated my order like 4 times"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Northside Nathan's Pizza for the last ten years and all we can say it is the \"Best Pizza\" in town. Additionally you should compare their prices to others and you won't be disappointed or hungry after you eat it."}
{"text":"Tastes just like Pizza Hut, except square.  Good grub food.  Not sure if it's a correct representation of Detroit pizza, but Lil Skeeza's (Ceasars), also from Detroit, is GREAT, better grub.  Flavored crust and crazy bread, WHAT?!!!!!!"}
{"text":"While in Las Vegas for the International Pizza Expo we had to stop by Northside Nathan's, so we hooked up with some pizza loving friends from the Detroit and hit the place up.  Before we left for the Expo we had been planning on checking this place out but we honestly didn't really have too high of hopes for it.  We found a couple of pictures of their pizza online and didn't think we would be impressed.

Well, we could have not been further from being right on this place. The second we walked in we were greeted by the owners and shown some good ole Detroit hospitality. No they didn't try to sell us guns, drugs, join their gang, or any other dumb Detroit comment you can think of. These folks were warm and welcoming. The place just felt like we were back home.  The place was loaded with some great Detroit sports memorabilia and some big screen TVs.  The dining room was anchored by a very nice and well thought out mural of Detroit as well.  These were some guys that clearly hadn't forgotten where they had come from.  Even the beer on the menu paid homage to Detroit. So we were pretty happy before we even started to eat.

We always order a pepperoni pizza (Detroit Style in this case).  I was a little disappointed to see them using Aluminum pans instead of the old-school Blue Steel pans that the famous Detroit Style places use like Cloverleaf and Buddy's.  They also put the sauce under the cheese which isn't true to the roots, but not the end of the world.  As we sat to wait for the pizza, the cheese bread came out.  It was some small bread loafs cut in half with some garlic butter and topped with some good tasting mozzarella cheese.  Nothing fancy but just plain good.  Around the same time I was finishing the bread, the pizza came.  The first bite reminded me of a little better tasting Jet's Pizza.  If you have ever had Jet's pizza you would know they do the deep dish pretty good.  Northside Nathan's featured a dough that was soft and airy, the sauce was clean and not over-seasoned, they really let the tomatoes do their thing with no strings attached.  The cheese was plentiful and baked to perfection, it tasted downright fantastic.

In the end, there is very little that I could complain about at Northside Nathan's.  I think it's hard to get a good crunch on the bottom of the pie when you are baking with aluminum pans.  The overall flavor was very good and we were very happy that they are representing Detroit in a great way with some good food.  If you are ever in the Vegas area and craving some good pizza check them out.  Todd, Shirley, John and Craig will take good care of you.  We look forward to the great things they have to come in the future.  See you guys next year!"}
{"text":"The best, local, reasonably priced pizza in LV this side of the strip! If I can't go get Evol Pie I'm eating Nathans"}
{"text":"Been coming here for my lunch breaks from work as a getaway to catch up on espn sports since they have 4 hd screens.

The folks that work here know their regulars and treat everyone with fam oriented service. I like the cozy feeling and vibe. It's close-to-tavern design is what makes it humble. 

it takes between 10-20 minutes to get food. but guess what this place has. old school arcade games to kill time. dank.

as for their eats, lets start with their breaded wings. perfectly fried to give that texture so when you bite in, its crispy shell and  juiciness in the middle makes each wing 'lish ('lish short for delicious). their wings dont have hot sauce, which comes on the side. tastey enough to have on its own. they give as many ramikens of ranch or bleu cheese as you need. and allow me to say, they have by far the best side of ranch compared to any other ranch ive tried. their pizza is deep and rich, so cheesey, 2 slices can be filling. 

i gave one less star, because i personally would love a billiard table in here. and ive never been to or tried actual detroit pizza so i couldn't compare. :)"}
{"text":"THE PIZZA WAS SQUARE!! 
That's not really a problem LoL and the food is all good nasty junk food like you'd want from a place like this. Cool atmosphere for what it is too. 

Trans-friendly- yea sure. maybe a few customers would be dumb but the staff is very nice :)"}
{"text":"Always good and always done right!!! B-E-S-T ranch EVER!! We have an over abundance of pizza establishments that are much closer to where we live, but we will go out of our way just to come here.  We leave full, with tons of leftovers, and never disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the environment, the food, the drinks. The tv's are amazing."}
{"text":"That's awesome. I got a comment back, from the owner at that.. And there were amazing coupons on our to-go box that definitely warranted a fifth star! Thanks John, see you soon!"}
{"text":"LOVE IT!!!!!
Finding a great pizza joint in Las Vegas is hard to do and this place takes the cake.
It is the BEST when you dine in and the cheese is warm and stringy.  We had the 
nicely nice with jalapenos.  Take the time to dine in...always tastes better.:))"}
{"text":"A place to get good pizza, but their sides are no good and over priced. I'll order pizza again! Very tasty."}
{"text":"Definitely Detroit-style, a very good imitation of Buddy's.
The pizza was great, the fries were good, the popcorn shrimp so-so."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Nathans! Best square deep dish around! The Nicely Nicely is our fav..."}
{"text":"The pizza quality is great! My biggest issue was the online ordering process. In haste I wasn't paying attention to the inches listed (\"6\") and I ordered two personal pizzas thinking that they were full sized (lol!). So my biggest comment about this place is PAY ATTENTION WHEN ORDERING ONLINE! For the price $20 I could have just ordered Novecento and had the same quality but more pizza."}
{"text":"I am a big pizza person.   Nathan's is okay but not great.  I've had bigger and yummier personal pizza for cheaper.  This personal pizza was so TINY and I paid 9$ for it! Really? I honestly would of saved the 9$.  Probably won't come back unless prices go down.  The pizza should of been a few $ cheaper for its size.  And each topping is 60 cents.  I usually pay 60cents for a LARGE not for a tiny personal pizza."}
{"text":"Wow....my husband and I ventured into this little place because the Einstein's across the way ran out of bagels.  Again.  (How does a bagel shop run out of bagels??). So we tried out Nathan's.  Stepping into this little gem is like stepping back into time, in a good way.  Brought back memories of a cool 1970's pizza arcade and the pizza is AMAZING.  The ambiance isn't for everybody but if you love great pizza, give it a shot!  We had the pepperoni and I can honestly say that it's definitely one of the best pizza joints in Vegas."}
{"text":"Accidentally walk in just to try it out.... Suprisingly! They're  delicious. Pizza and wings! Nothing else I can but it my whole family's favorite... Just brought in 6 More people and treat them out....Yup it's a hit!"}
{"text":"You walk in and order at the front counter before sitting down. Prices are a little high, especially if getting your own 6\". A 6\", small side salad, and a drink will run you around $14. It came out pretty quick. The pizza itself was nothing to write home about. A lot of cheese and not much sauce. Might come back to give it one more try but not sure yet."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and you get a bunch of food for the money. The only downfall was the booth seating was rather uncomfortable & the music was annoying!"}
{"text":"First time and definitely will be back!! First time since moving to Vegas a couple years ago that I have felt that Midwest vibe in a restaurant. Great atmosphere. Food was amazing (fried pickles, Greek salad, wings and thin crust pizza). Staff extremely nice. So happy we tried it out!"}
{"text":"I went here a bunch of people on a Friday night. It was defiantly a dive bar feeling with a supposedly \"Detroit\" feeling. I couldnt vouch for that as I havent been there but it was cool. There was a lot of knick-nacks on the wall from sports teams and stuff. The lighting was very dim and it was hard to see. We went there with a friend who was in wheel chair and it was hard to accommodate him. We didnt make a reservation and we had a party of 8. There was no wait at all. But like I said it was akward eating without the accommodation for my friend. They kinda had to stick us in the middle isle on a long table where they were limited space while the people behind us in the book kinda brushed our backs as they tried to fit into their booth seat.
Reguardless, I have to say I ate there a week ago and I am still craving their traditional Detroit 1 topping pizza. We got 4 pizzas: 1 topping pepperoni, Nicely Nicely's: garlic and chicken, Adelaides special/the works, and the Sky Mastersons pizza: Sausage and pepperoni and onions. All the other pizzas were ok, I didnt like the chicken one due to how dry the chicken was, the works was kinda soggy, and I didnt get to try the Masterson pizza because I was so full. Like I said the one I loved was the 1 topping pepperoni. It reminded me of when pizza hut used to make personal pan pizzas with the semi deep dish crust- oily yet still crunchy and super delicious. My mother always told me the best way to judge a pizza is by eating as little toppings as possible, so cheese and cheese+pepperoni is the way that I judge a good pizza. 
We also got 50 wings- 2 orders of 25. It was delicious. The wings dont have any sauce on it as they are fried \"naked\" style- no breading. Super hot and crispy and golden on the outside with a sweet/juicy/tender/hot chicken on the inside. Compliments to the chef who cooks those wings.
The best part is that they make their own ranch dressing there: Marvelous Marion. Im not a huge ranch person as I prefer blue cheese but everyone seemed to love it. Each set of wings comes with 2 ranch sauces and you can order blue cheese on the side for 55 cents.

The only downside about this place is that the pizza is kinda expensive (18-20$) for 9 piece pizza and also it wasnt clear how to order! We kinda just sat there for like 10-15min wondering when the water was going to come. And the waitresses are all just standing around. It was very confusing. We finally asked the lady to take our order and she told us we have to order our own food at the front window. The good thing is that the beers are cheap (PBR for 1.75) and other beers are anywhere from 3-5$. 

I probably be back although it is kinda out of my way for WINGS and that 1 topping pepperoni pizza!"}
{"text":"Called this location prior to visit, the boy that answered the phone was so rude we didn't even want to go. Food is good so we gave 2 stars."}
{"text":"Yummy deep dish pizza reminiscent of Detroit naturally! Had a mix of the Gangster's choice and Nathan Detroit! Both garlic fantastic! The atmosphere was welcoming and the walls were filled great memorabilia!"}
{"text":"In June we have lived here for 3 years and just found this place!  It is DELISH!!!  We had a Italian sub and antipasta salad.  The bread on the sub was awesome and the dressing for the salad was great....  Only thing missing would be the yellow peppers on the salad but that is a ok with us!  Trying the pizza next!"}
{"text":"New York has floppy triangles.
Chicago has reverse topping deep dish circles.
Detroit has thick rectangles. 

Northside Nathan's is real Detroit style pizza. Consistently well risen sweet dough.  Tangy tomato sauce and real mozzarella cheese and fresh veggies and meats.  Decent topping amounts. Overall a solid pizza that I will gladly try again for a second opinion."}
{"text":"Northside Nathan's has always been the best in Vegas! Super fresh ingredients, and baked perfectly! We've been here several times and have never been disappointed!! If it's pizza, it's Northside Nathan's!! Come early to make sure you get a seat."}
{"text":"I used to love this place a lot. They're a bit on the expensive side, but the pizza was great. Not NY pizza great, but great for what it was. I picked up a pie on Tuesday (6/2/09) and it was devoid of flavor. Not the first time this happened. What makes a pizza place great in my opinion is consistency. I've dined in a few times and the staff seemed annoyed and came off as rude.
I'm officially done with Northside Nathans."}
{"text":"Being from Detroit and growing up on amazing (the best) Detroit pizza from Loui's, Buddy's, Jet's, I was so excited to find a place that served \"Detroit style\" pizza and classic Detroit style antipasto salad. We knew we had to try it. We ordered a large square with pepperoni and ham and medium antipasto salad. The salad was good. It had an abundance of ham, salami, and cheese. The dressing was decent. One of the stars above is for the salad alone...
The pizza topping were good too. The cheese was deliciously melty and there were an abundance of toppings. There's that other star! 

I have nothing good to say about the crust of the pizza we received. It was horribly dense and flat almost like they left an ingredient out OR they used frozen dough. There was hardly any of that delicious crispy crust you see on a real Detroit style pizza. It was tasteless, hard, and really dried out. I am not sure if we hit the restaurant on a bad day or if it is always this bad. Compared to the pizza we had last night, we'd rather have Great Baron frozen french bread pizza, Little Caesar's, Costco pizza. For $36, we expect a much better quality than we received. It makes me sad that the pizza we received was labeled \"Detroit style\" when it so horribly represented real Detroit pizza."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the reviews so I decided to make a delivery order. Had to wait an hour for a 4 piece pan sized, cheese pizza and some wings, when it arrived the crust was wet and soggy and wings were complete mush. We sent the food back, had to wait ANOTHER hour for my food. Asked for wings to be more crispy, got them back completely fried to the bone. Imagine biting into a ball of fried chicken skin, that's what I got for dinner. Disgusting experience never coming back."}
{"text":"One cold night I was playing Mario Kart and on a winning streak. Conundrum: I'm incredibly hungry but don't want to stop playing. Solution: pizza! As any good yelper does I opened my app and searched for a somewhere to order between races. 

I ordered the Gangsters Choice and a Greek salad. 
I was not disappointed with either! 

The Gangsters choice has capicola, garlic, and jalapeños. The pizza is not deep dish but has a similar taste. Personally, I love slightly burnt crunchy cheese and they never disappoint since their pizza is a square I get the crunch on all sides. The garlic is abundant and freshly chopped. I'm a fire eater so I can use more jalapeños, but for the medium lovers it's perfecto! If you don't like spicy don't get this. One of my friends couldn't eat past 2 bites due to the spicy level. If you are a ranch lover then you must try theirs! It's 75 cents each, but wow, you'll never see ranch the same again. 

Their Greek salad was simple. Black olives, red onions, cucumbers, feta cheese, and romaine lettuce. It was perfect! 

I've got this same deal about 3 times since the first time I ordered it. Haha.

I highly recommend. Their pizza is a little expensive (compared to chain delivery places), but very much worth it. ( just to give an idea $15.25 for a 9 piece one topping pizza)"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. My relatives enjoy all the pasta and salads and such, but Im there for PIZZA so I guess its safe to say all their food is great! Very worth the price. Not that expensive but its definitely not Pizza Hut"}
{"text":"Detroit Pizza is delicious. I'm a huge fan of Northside Nathan's. I remember going here when I was younger with the family. I just moved to the area and order on the yelp app for delivery. It was fast and simple. The pizza is good but make sure you know what size you are ordering. I ended up getting two smalls instead of 2 regular size pizzas. It luckily worked out. We kind of got a little sample going. I also ordered the churros and ice cream which was really delicious that or I was just really really hungry. I will be ordering again for sure but making sure I get the right size. It's better than the normal pizza hut and dominoes. I think the next step is to order wings and give them a try. It's good to have a nice pizza place close."}
{"text":"I like how you do not feel rushed to leave. I like also how tasty the pizza is.  I love their fries and I even tried the fried pickle which was quite interesting.  Great place for group gatherings.  The staff is pleasant and helpful. I definitely recommend checking this place out. It is a like a sports bar but family, friend gathering friendly."}
{"text":"I stopped by after a craving for pizza overwhelmed me. There is a very nice priced lunch special for a 2 topping personal pizza and drink. I added some Detroit Red Wings to my order. I am pretty new to the Vegas area and have been searching for a good chicken wing. I've tried several local bars and what not, but I think I have found my wing! NN has a extra crunchy fried wing not tossed in some dreadful wing sauce, which makes it perfect if you like naked wings. The pizza is good as well, but there was a slight sour taste that did not sit well with me. I got the same off putting taste at another local establishment. My taste buds could be off, I'm not sure. Menu taken with, I will return. I am not a Detroit or Michigan anything fan but, the place has a true oldschool sports bar feel. Enjoy the sounds of the 60's playing in the background."}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza in town.  I also love the Cadillac sandwich.  Dine in or take out, it's just great!"}
{"text":"I have done take out before last Fall. The Food was really good. I ordered delivery thru Yelp and it was not a good experience. Plus the food was by far below par. I honestly don't know what changed. The pizza was bland at best. The garlic cheesy bread had no garlic flavor. The Detroit wings were hot but mushy in texture. I was less than impressed this time around."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite pizza places in Vegas.  Their deep dish is super yum (Sky Masterson or Pepperoni and Garlic are the best).  Their chicken wings are also the best I've had in Vegas.  It's a bit pricey but well worth it."}
{"text":"I'm a repeat customer. Omg sooo good. I love their pizza and greek salad. Generous helping of cheese cake droolz! This time I ordered the small sampler great for two people and sky masterson pizza it arrived fresh and hot!"}
{"text":"We ordered lunch and it was awesome. Fast delivery. Fair prices. Great food. We will be regulars."}
{"text":"Our food was just delicious. We ordered the large Gangsters Special and Canada's Cup and a bucket of wings. Pizza was perfect. Perfectly cooked. Ingredients were on point. Just the right amount of everything. Excellent. Just excellent!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in years. Reminds me of Nancy's In Chicago. The traditional round crust was crispy but perfection. It's of cheese & the mushrooms made it taste like a mushroom pizza ( I swear with the big chains nothing tastes like anything if that makes any sense) 

5stars, will be back soon"}
{"text":"I came here a couple times and I loved the food :-) just that every girl employee that has taken my order has no personality what so ever. I came here last week on a Tuesday and I came across a male cashier that actually had a great personality compared to the other female cashiers. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem. The pizza is delicious, the wings are the best around (similar to wingers if you've ever had it) and the salads are always fresh and tasty. The staff is friendly enough but the flow of the restaurant is a little confusing."}
{"text":"We got the pepperoni sausage and onion pizza to go. I personally love pizza and they had good sauce and a good crust. The pizza was really good all in all. The service was quick and friendly. They have a lot of parking in this area. And they have some options in their shopping center, such as they have a smiths if you want to go to the store or a Starbucks if you want some coffee. They have some TVs in their place so you can watch games or whatever you want while you are there. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant until they featured on Dirty Dining! I find it interesting that I continue to see advertisements on Facebook promoting visiting.  I'm asking if the health violations have been corrected and I've received zero response. This means one of two things. Either the problem hasn't been corrected or you simply don't care to address a customer that visited your establishment at least once a week.  I'm done."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok, average at best. Employees on the other hand, rude and disrespectful. I paid for 4 soft drinks and ask for a water for myself. After being eyed by the bar tender, she actually approached my table and stated I needed to pay for another soft drink because I only paid for 4 and got 5. REALLY! Are you serious! The only thing I drink is water, period. Long story short, my four y/o son actually used my water cup for his lemonade and I used the larger cup for my water. What a joke. Will NEVER return to this mediocre pizza joint that was recently SHUT DOWN due to numerous HEALTH CODE VIOLATIONS, featured on Las Vegas KTNV.com DIRTY DINING. I guess the employees attitudes go hand in hand with the way the kitchen is managed. Stay far far away from this place unless you want to leave with food poisoning with accusations of being a thief."}
{"text":"I went there because someone said the wings were good.  I called and someone who barely spoke English took my order.  She said 25 minutes.  I got there at 30 minutes.  There was a line to buy food.  I saw a woman (who barely spoke English) and told her that I already ordered my food.  She said that I still have to wait in line.  15 minutes later I finally got my order.  When I got home, the order was wrong and the food was cold.   Basically, they treated me like I was not important at all."}
{"text":"Ordered a 16\" custom Detroit-style pizza, half Guys n' Dolls-half pepperoni, pineapple, bell pepper, bacon.   Very bland, and needed more sauce. Had to add more cheese and garlic when heating up leftover. Was lucky to find a piece of bacon every 3-4 bites. After seeing all the pics, I expected to be highly satisfied for our 1st visit. Wasn't really. 
On the other hand, had the small sampler appetizer:  the chicken wings were Awesome!"}
{"text":"If you love thick crust pizza then this place is for you. The crust stays crunchy and intact. There's nothing worse than a soggy crust pizza. I thought that it was a little overpriced (20.00 for a 3 item medium pizza) and the wrong meat was on my pizza. The staff is super friendly. I ordered a medium pizza with Canadian bacon, mushroom and olives. I got ham instead of Canadian bacon. Trust me I know the difference between the 2. It came out in a square shape and I loved that the crust was crunchy and stayed that way. It was a good tasting pizza and if you don't mind the crust then this is the perfect place for you. I personally prefer thin crust. They do not offer thin crust because this is Detroit style pizza joint. I would definitely come back. I would recommend ordering one of the pizza off heir menu instead of adding toppings on its own because they charge 1.50/topping and it can get on the pricey side. I know a place that doesn't charge for toppings."}
{"text":"My dad, sister, and I are first timers here. Again, I'm a huge pizza fanatic. They offer deep dish pizzas for a reasonable price. I ordered the Nicey Nicey pizza. It was pretty tasty! My dad ordered a sub, no complaints from him.. And not even a crumb left over. So I guess it's safe to assume that he liked it. Lol! The cheesy bread is delicious! Comes with marinara sauce and 4 big slices for a small price! 

I like the decor! It has a sports bar feel to it.  TVs everywhere and games as well. If you want to try out a new pizza place, I recommend trying this place out. 

I docked a star just because the cashier absolutely had NO personality. She wasn't welcoming whatsoever. We had a little trouble figuring out what to order, she just stood there staring at us."}
{"text":"I don't like this pizza no flavor compared to Napolis, verrazano, due forni, or Rocco's"}
{"text":"That was some awesome deep pan crust!!! I was just a Pizza Hut fan before cuz that's what I grew up on. Here's a place that beat the taste! I'm veering away from my habitual choices I guess. Change is good, yeah.

I saw this place when I picked up Pink Box donuts the other week. I was due to spend time with my Vitug famz so I brought up suggestion of this place for grubbs. No hesitations- we met up here.

Pizza came out to the table after about 15 minutes from ordering. I wish I took a picture of our 9 piece square deep pan mushroom-pepperoni-sausage pizza. I would've wanted to show how crispy the edges even looked, just as it tasted. And the cheese! All stretchy gooey and yumz! I don't think the flavor was only in the toppings. It had to have been in the crust too. Whatever is in their secret recipe made us kill that pizza. Satisfyingly hit the spot and we were super hungry.

They have pinball games and some kiddy games. The interior is fun looking with all sorts of state representing posters. The walls in the pick up window area for to-go orders is done up with license plates. The dining experience is kick back casual. Really gives a no-rush atmosphere.

I've tasted Chicago and New York style pizzas. It's a first for me with Detroit style pizza. They appear to be the only one in this area with this to offer. I'll be trying other pizzas for sure. I'll be ordering from here too when family is in town. I'm glad I decided to try them. And they're close by. They deliver too!"}
{"text":"Decent pizza (love the thickness of the crust), bit pricey, Chicken wings are great, and service its quick"}
{"text":"Decent sauce - square pizza - crunchy but tender crust.  

Note that it can be totally crazy trying to get a table (people shoving each other out of the way -- one family taking up 2 or 3 booths).  Might want to consider take-out."}
{"text":"Northside Nathans.  It was an accident I even ended up here. SmashBurger was pretty busy - I just wanted to get in and get out without having to wait in a big line,  so I opted for NN.

The decor is pretty generic,  family areas with brighter paint on one side - dark earth tones in the adult areas. TV 's all over.

I ordered at the window, as you walk in. I ordered a meatball sandwich. And a beer.
I was hoping for a meatball sandwich that could at least get close to a \"\"Busy Bee \" meatball sandwich.  No such luck.  Busy Bee is a small mom & pop market in San Pedro,  Ca.  If your ever in San Pedro - maybe to see the USS Iowa - google \"Busy Bee Market \". One of the finest sandwich purveyors I've  ever encountered. Anyway, this Northside Nathan was OK - but nothing to write home about.  The toasted bun was a mouth scalder. The marinara and cheese had some flavor - but the meatballs themselves were bland. On a scale of 1 to 10 - 10 being  a Busy Bee meatball sandwich - Northside Nathans scores a whopping 4.

I rate NN 3 stars. It wasnt aweful, it wasnt bad,  it was just an average meatball sandwich . You probably won't  even remember eating it,  let alone recommend it to others."}
{"text":"After ordering from Nathan's for 3 years (carryout), I called this evening and was told they would not deliver bc they were too busy. I offered to pay over the phone with my cc like I do each time and have my partner pick up the pizza after seeing his last patient at the hospital. Bc I couldn't bring my i.d. to the location I was told Marco the owner said no, they would not sell me my order. 

After 3 years of ordering pizza 2-3 times per month this is how the owner treats a regular customer. It's apparent you don't need my business. I will no longer use your restaurant, and look to another pizza place for my orders, party and office orders. I'm sure Rocco's, etc will be happy to serve me. FAIL"}
{"text":"The worst customer service ever! I called and placed an order, walked in 5 minutes later and changed one of the pizzas. I left without checking my pizzas. I got home to find the original pizza I didn't want. I called them and they said no problem come and get the correct pizza. 2 minutes later they called me and said they couldn't change my order because the pizza was already in the oven. 1. Who does that? 2. They never said that... Cause I wouldn't of paid for the pizzas. The stupid girl said you have two options, bring back the pizza for a refund or exchange it for the correct one. I told her to keep the money and the f***king pizza cause I WONT RETURN! 

I can see your point about not wasting a pizza, but tell me. Don't say ok and then let me pay for it and still give me the unwanted pizza. Lost my business for life. I will not recommend this place to anyone. The customer isn't always right at this place!!"}
{"text":"Placed a delivery order at 12:11PM, received an email saying that it would be delivered at 1:11PM. Still had not shown up, so I called Northside Nathan's Pizza at 1:26PM to check on my order as it was already 15 mins late, I was advised that the driver had just left with my order. It is now 1:46 and still has not shown up. Now mind you I am 1.1 miles away and only ordered one 6\" with an order of fries. I now have 5 mins left of my lunch and am hungry with no food in sight. This has not only been a waste of $17 but also a waste of my time and day. I will not be ordering from them ever again!


UPDATE:
delivery still had not shown, it is now 1:53PM. I have wasted my lunch waiting for them and am now hangry. I called and cancelled the order and requested a refund. Lady that answered the phone did not give any apology at all for the ridiculous waste of time. I will definitely be spreading the word among my coworkers not to order from them."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place ever. No other place compares! I've been coming here for years. I go with a basic pepperoni pizza and a house salad and I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"Went to Northside Nathan's last weekend with my guy and our friends. We had fries, wings and a pepperoni pizza. I didn't eat the wings, but heard they were pretty good. Atmosphere was alright, nothing crazy. The fries were good, nice and crispy, and their ranch went really well with them. The pizza was decent, the crust had a nice garlic-y taste. The $40 total for fries, pizza, and wings seems a bit high to me, considering the quality.

Overall, I wasn't really wow-ed with Northside Nathan's. Would probably only come back if it were a friend's idea."}
{"text":"Good Detroit style pizza. This is rectangular thick crispy pizza with sauce on top. However, it is not like the gold standard for this style - Buddy's Pizza in Detroit. Note that the smallest pizza is very small so a medium is probably good for one person. The large is more for 2 people. I had plain cheese & vegetarian & both were good. There is plenty of seating. The restaurant is filled with memorabilia, much of it from Detroit & Michigan sports teams. They also serve Faygo root beer, which is a Detroit area brand. Service is friendly."}
{"text":"Never had Detroit style pizza before, so we checked out NN...Pretty good pizza, and I love the taste of the crust,,,The pizza doesn't  get soggy, and the toppings are just the right amount.

Their wings are pretty good too...we got them to go, and when we got home to enjoy them, they were still very crispy...Neapolitan, Roman, New York, Chicago, or Detroit
style, as long as its a great tasting  pizza, I'm a fan of any style...ALOHA!!!

{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this place. My family and I love eating here. We can count on coming here. Food is delicious and reasonable. My only minor complaint is the charge for ranch. I feel like being a pizza and wing joint. Their shouldn't be a charge for extra ranch."}
{"text":"Was anxious to try their pizza. Had heard positive reviews. Had a pepperoni pizza delivered last night and I needed to get a magnifying glass to locate sauce on the pizza. It was delivered cold and tasted like cold cheese bread. It was my first time trying their pizza and quite possibly the last. Maybe it was just a bad night for the cooks? On the upside the cheese cake was very good. Delivery to Summerlin is a plus. It was better than the Dominoes I ordered last weekend."}
{"text":"Hello! Nice menu that offers cool combinations like the Sky Masterson, featuring pepperoni, sausage, ham and meatballs!  The place is decorated with a tribute to Detroit, the sports, and city representation. the side salad is topped with carrots, tomatoes and cucumbers. They have your other basic fare like wings and mozzarella sticks. The kids get to watch cartoons and the adults get their sports fix. I highly recommend this place get more visitors... i think it's taken for granted because of the commercialized restaurants nearby at Boca park. Come down!!"}
{"text":"Two times I have called up to get pizza delivered and they wouldn't deliver because they were closing in 45 minutes. Another time it was an hour before closing. They must bot care about repeat business. We will spend our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love this place...been comig here for years.

The chicken wings here are great..great size and juicy as hell. Never do ya get those overfried dog toys!

The Antipasta salad is bomb...simple..and packed with meat and cheese. Not to leave out what may be my favorite dressing for an antipasto  salad..ever.

What of the pizza you ask? Its kick ass as well...nothing super spectacular but it is better than most places. Served square/rectangle several styles but fave is the mini so I can be a true tank and get wings and salad too!!

Small bar inside but still family safe and they have a bazillion TV's to watch whatever you want.

All in all...this is one of my staples in my food routines."}
{"text":"Waited 30 mins for my carry out order. Staff barely spoke english. Pizza was mediocre, and didn't have sauce on top (as true detroit style pizza is). Wings were very small as well.  Overall, just not a good experience, not worth the money, and probably won't return."}
{"text":"I am not sure how I haven't reviewed this place. I found it when I first moved here four years ago. This is one of three pizza places I'll go to in Vegas that I actually really like the pizza at. At one time I actually did live in Detroit and I can attest to the fact this is Detroit pizza. There are three good things that have come out of Detroit: cars, Eminem, and northside Nathan's.  

The pizzas are square, they're very cheesy and I like the sauce and the crust is crispy but doughy in the middle of each slice it's so good, you get both. It's very reasonably priced too, I've always gotten really good service everyone has been super nice. I think they have traditional round pizza too but I love their deep dish square pizza so much I haven't even bothered with anything else. I usually get the small/personal size it's four square slices, sometimes if I'm going to have lunch or dinner for a couple days I'll get the medium, that one has nine slices. I also really like their go blue garlic cheese bread that's very good as well. I've had their mozzarella sticks too, you've had one mozzarella stick you've pretty much had them all they don't stand out in any particular way,but they're good as well. 

I know pizza I am from New York. It's not easy to find good pizza in Vegas but I promise you this is one of the places. 

Be there or be square!"}
{"text":"This place is called Northside Nathan's for a reason. If you expect REAL Italian pizza you might get disappointed. But you will get disappointed with 99% of the American pizza places also.

The eastern influence is undeniable! The chicken wings could easily rival my Hungarian grandmothers fried chicken and the pizza dough is more like a 'beerde' - if you speak Swabian - or that of a thin crust tart. The toppings with my Greek style were surprisingly fresh. 

I will come back!"}
{"text":"Since Tenaya Creek Brewery doesn't serve food, we ordered delivery from Northside Nathan's, which is nearby.  After browsing the menu, we decided to get a Large 1/2 Guys & Dolls (Sausage, Pepperoni, Onions) & Veggetarian (Onions, Peppers, Mushrooms, Tomatoes, Olives).....$24.  They told us 45 min to 1 hour.....not bad during the Super Bowl.

The food didn't seem to take long to deliver.....we anxiously tore open the box and started to dive into it....it was very very good!  The crust is thick like Sicilian style Pizza and is fluffy and full of flavor.  The Pizza is square-cut and holds the toppings well on the crust.  It hit the spot!

Easily one of my favorite Pizza & Sandwich joints in town.

Return Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"A really fun and laid back atmosphere. This is the best pizza found here in Las Vegas!! The crust is to die for! The staff is always very nice and the music is the best. 70's and 80's hits!"}
{"text":"Wanted to order a pizza tonight. Called to see what time they closed and the girl says \"ummmmm we close at 10 but lemme see if we're closing earlier\" wtf?!?! Then she returns and says \"the manager wants to close early\" What type of business is this place that isn't open for the time they advertise???? I will never visit this place and I'm telling all my friends not to go as well. Smh"}
{"text":"Had a weird experience at Northside Nathan's last night.  Bought a restaurant.com GC which you have to dine in to use.  Drove over around 9pm, seeing that they were open until 10pm on restaurant.com.  Showed up and there was a sign saying dine in only until 8:30pm, take out after.  Turns out they were painting the inside, so we had to get our pizza to go.  Luckily, the girl honored the GC anyway.

This place is so close to my house, I don't know how I've never been here before.  Got a large deep dish pepperoni, and it was really, really good.  $22 though after tax?  Glad I got my $10 off GC.  Seemed a little pricey, though a steal with the GC.

Very buttery flavor.  Mmmm."}
{"text":"I walked in 4 minutes before they closed and wasn't going to order so the staff could go home... not only were they happy to take my order, it was honestly one of the best pizzas I've had in town.  I tipped then 80% for being so attentive and happy even though they wanted to go home. Amazing service AND food!!"}
{"text":"Food's good. Ambiance good. They advertise NFL game day - every game, every Sunday on their door. And The Simpsons are on at 1pm on a Sunday. Conclusion: Go for the pizza. Not the games.

Appreciate GMs response. Since my post my fam has made Northside Nathans a regular pizza dinner stop after family outings. Great pizza. Great service. Great place."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmmy! My family loves this place! We. Normally order a large and do half of two different toppings. They let you customize what you want or choose from a menu of specialty items. The crust is deeeeelish! It's also a rectangle and cut into squares. Between the 4 of us we still have enough for left overs :) 

Don't forget to cut out the coupons from the pizza box or take advantage of the coupons they give out from time to time!"}
{"text":"Great food, lousy  service. Went there before Xmas at 630 and was told I would HAVE to get it to go because it was there Xmas party and the mgr wanted everyone out by 7. What kind o cheap ass feeds his employees the same food they make and serve day in day out. They wouldn't even offer to give give a break on the price. Won't be back and I'm a regular."}
{"text":"Consistently good food is so hard to find and it's here. I prefer this pizza over any other in LV."}
{"text":"Omg this place is the BEST! We usually get their chicken wings, fries and pizza. Never fails, they serve good portions and always end up taking food home. Iam not a pizza person but this place can make me eat 3/4 slices!"}
{"text":"I love the pizza here it's delicious took me a while to find a good pizza place and I found it can't wait to try them all"}
{"text":"Love this place! We have been coming here for over 8years. Love the pizza and atmosphere. Just need to update the kid games."}
{"text":"Lunch-time service was poor at best. after 10 minutes I had to remind them I ordered a beer which 5 minutes later I found out they ran out of. The waitress spoke no English - zero. After my daughter received the wrong salad and sent it back she said her Caesar salad was \"OK\". Chicken finger appetizers were blah. fries were good. The pizza that I finally decided to have to go...Was great tasting!"}
{"text":"We visit Northside Nathan's at least twice every month and are never disappointed. Their pizza is always hot, fresh, and perfectly crispy around the edges. My two-year-old loves their french fries, and the rest of us love their big, crispy onion rings with garlicky ranch dressing.

We've also tried a few of their salads, which are always ice cold and fresh. Their meatballs, whether with spaghetti or in their sandwich, are big and hearty and full of flavor.

We love the casualness of this place in that we can get our own drink refills, watch their big TV's, and let our toddler check out all the bright lights of their video game machines."}
{"text":"This place is by far our favorite pizza place! Love their pineapple and pepperoni pizza and crust!  My daughter loves to play the arcade games there as it's very family oriented! They are always busy and have seating outside too. There's always Pink Box next door too that's hard to resist. Overall, they rock!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, and extremely suprised!!!  Went there on a reccommendation, and was pleasantly suprised. Pizza was loaded with flavor, tomato sauce was not acidy,with just the right amount of cheese. The wings were outstanding as well, crispy on the outside and tender inside, my kids loved the fact that sauces were on the side so they can dip. This will now be our go to for Pizza in town."}
{"text":"Pizza is good, ingredients are fresh. We come here for the hot wings, they are scrumptious!"}
{"text":"The cook and the cashier very lazy the restaurant was slow not a lot of people in it I don't know where the owner is also as far as the food was made it was just thrown together just to get me out of the way again there was not anyone else in the restaurant"}
{"text":"Definitely Recommend!! Pepperoni pizza is so good! Cheese is very gooey !! Also tried the wings and they were good as well! I love that the food is so hot when it comes out! My kids loved their food as well. It seems like a bar at first but no its actually kid friendly!!"}
{"text":"This place is great  families. They have booths you can sit in with your kids and the food is great. We ordered the sampler platter and one of the deep dsh pizzas (i cant remember exactly which one, but it was DELICIOUS!). They offer a varietyoof beers and wine which is kinda cool. And decent prices we spent about 40$ for the 4 of us to eat. 2nd time here and we'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Best pizza we've had so far in vegas. Quality ingredients! The price may seem high, but you can tell everything is fresh!"}
{"text":"My daughter's volleyball coach chose this for their end of season team party location.  We'd never been, but I'd noticed the restaurant a few times when shopping in the area.  

The restaurant has a homelike sports pub feel, with several TVs to watch your favorite sport, without all the loud noise of large pubs.  

They serve your standard pizza, salad and wings, but I was impressed with the pizza.  It was deep dish, but they still managed to crisp the bottom of the pizza.  So tasty!  

The service really earned them the 4 stars in my opinion.  They were friendly and attentive, offering to refill your drinks at the self service bar and giving a discount for team orders."}
{"text":"All time favorite pizza place. Reminds me of my moms homemade pizza. And the chicken wings and tenders are awesome. The atmosphere is wonderful, especially during Christmas. I really enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Let me start with I'm so happy this place exists in Vegas, I'm from a small town about 45 minuets North of Detroit. Whenever we went into Detroit we would always get Pizza in the Detroit style. You have nailed the taste of Detroit Pizza. The entire experience was wonderful, from the decor of Detroit sports teams right down to the food. Service was absolutely wonderful as well. Now that I live here I will definitely be back for more. Keep up the great work & as always GO BLUE, Go Wings, Go Tigers, Go Pistons & Please Bless our Lions!!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is amazing! My husband is not a fan of deep dish and their pizza is the only deep dish he likes. All of their pizzas look so yummy that you want to try them all. The inside is small, but has a cute east coast look and theme."}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza place in Vegas. Great Detroit style pizza, fresh salads and great kid's stuff. Even a bar for the grownups! We love this place!"}
{"text":"This was a first time for a place really close to home.  I was a bit disappointed with the inside, which was kinda honky-tonk and dreary.  

We shared a Nicely Nicely pizza and a salad.  The menu said Romaine blend, which I'm glad I noticed, since it meant iceberg.  Kudos to the kitchen for honoring our request to make it all romaine.

The pizza was okay, with tasty chicken, mushrooms and garlic, but we're not great fans of square pizza and, after all we ARE New Yorkers by birth and upbringing, so most pizza pales by comparison. It was was acceptable, though the abundant cheese didn't taste like genuine mozzarella. Still, the crust was crispy, so it fit the bill.

I ordered a glass of wine, since Sheila's Law stipulates that any food remotely Italian must be accompanied by wine.  It wasn't the best, but at 4 bucks a glass, I'm not complaining too loudly."}
{"text":"I love deep dish pizza, and square deep dish pizza is even better! Northside does Detroit style pizza which means it's deep and it's square (just like Detroit?). Their restaurant is decorated with Detroit gear set with an orange Detroit Tigers wall and a red Red Wings Wall (sorry Pistons, I didn't notice a wall for you) which is cool since they are my hubbies teams. 

You walk in and order at a window where the menu is located on a machine top or you can grab a menu. Then you can sit at any booth. We happened to have a Groupon for $20 so we got an 11 inch Guys and Dolls pizza, two fountain drinks, and hubby got a beer. With the groupon we only paid $4. The pizza is delevered to you and placed on a platform at your table. The deliciousness is hot so don't burn your tongue. I didn't think we would finish it all but three pieces for me and six pieces for him later and it's gone! If you love deep dish crust, the square-ness of the pizza gives you that extra crust love with the corner pieces. If you're not a big crust fan, go for the sans-crust middle pieces. Something for every pizza lover. 

When our lunch was done, they even gave us a customer appreciation coupon for the next time for a free mini-skinny pizza which is thin crust. They do have other things on the menu, but why do that when they're so good at pizza? Love it and would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"First of all the pie was not worth almost 17.00 !!! It was not what I call deep dish !! At least not like Buddy's !! Not even close !!! It was maybe 1/2 inch thick !! It was barely enough for a hungry man !! Sorry for bad review but I still have to give you one star for value , thickness and taste !! The sausage was awful !!!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch after church and I must say that the pizza was amazing.  We had the Detroit deep dish equivalent of a supreme with everything on it.  The pizza tasted fresh and was very hot.  The atmosphere is fun with sports, celebrity, and vintage video games.  This is a great staple for pizza in the northwest."}
{"text":"Just picked up this Medium Deep Dish 2 Topping Pizza for $18.00 Are you Fng kidding me.. Only 9 pieces is small forva medium and this is NOT DEEP DISH. This is A FUCKING JOKE of a pizza.  To expensive and. Do not recommend. I would give Zero stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Nathan's pizzeria specializes in Detroit pizza. If you wonder what Detroit pizza is, it's a combination between Chicago's deep dish and regular thick crust pizza. We ordered the \"nicely nicely\" which is chicken, garlic and mushrooms. The crust is nice and crunchy. The mushrooms had a great taste to it. The whole combination was great. The restaurant also offers bar food, sandwiches and beer or wine. It's family friendly and also a good place to hang out w friends! So if u r feeling like you are tired of your traditional pizza, come and check this place out!"}
{"text":"ATTENTION EVERYONE!!!!!! THIS PLACE HAS THE BEST WINGS AND PIZZA IN THE CITY!!! The food here is the best in the city when it comes to chicken and pizza! The staff here treats you like family every time!"}
{"text":"It's right by my house I love the pizza, especially the thin crust. And the wings r delicious and they have this red hot sauce in a bottle and it's amazing on everything must try. They even took my credit card over the phone and delivered pizza to my girlfriend who wasn't feeling good at home. Love this place"}
{"text":"So ready to leave my former home of Detroit, Michigan. I took for granted all the cuisine that I would miss. Pizza is one of them. Northside Nathan's certainly delivers on one of the pizza styles found in Michigan, and it nice to play nostalgic, with menu items giving reverence to the Detroit Red Wings. Anyhow, I'll tell you what I love. I love the square style pizza. Although it is a deeper crust, it is still fresh and the dough has a crispness and texture that I love. One thing I do notice, however is that due to some of their special flavorings in oils and herbs, that I can tell, at times, when there is a different cook. It's never disappointing, but sometimes it may provide a different taste. My only fault with Northside Nathan's, and it is slight, given it's cuisine, is that there is not much outside of that which is dipped in fat and/or fried in the offerings beyond pizza. The only choice would be one of their four different types of salads."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW. I enjoy pizza just as much as everyone else. But I like the fact that the pizza is think, airy and flaky.  The sauce is a little on the sweet side but with the toppings I feel it equals out. 

I recently went here for a friends birthday and have to say it blows and pizza hut, papa johns or dominoes our of the water. We had the antipasto salad with plenty of vine ripe tomatoes and tons of little bite sized salami and cheese. But as another reviewer said the dressing is a little acidic therefore I suggest using only about half of it. We also had some of their wings; that unlike most pizza joints are of the breaded variety instead of the fried or oven baked. The breaded wings are fried to perfection, light and crisp but are not spicy as the sauce comes on the side. Our pizza was their classic Guy and Doll (sausage, pepperoni, onion) and was fantastic. 

For those who don't normally like square deep dish give this joint a try. I did and have deemed it one of my favs."}
{"text":"I got the gangsters choice. Delicious! Super fun sports bar atmosphere. Super nice staff. Fast service. Fresh delicious pizza!! It was very unique from anything I'd had. Which is a huge plus since pizza is usually pizza! I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and definitely found our Go-To Pizza place!

We've ordered both takeout and just tonight, delivery. Our food has been correct, ready when told it would be, fresh and hot. 

We've had the \"deep dish\" style pizza which is finger licking delish! Look forward to trying the traditional style. 
Lrg. Greek Salad: the romaine is crisp, fresh, topped with freshly cut vegi's, lots of feta, and black olives. 
Toasted Ham and Cheese: now, I was taken back by this item because my hubby always orders sub-par ham&cheese subs in the past. When we opened the takeout container, I immediately could tell the roll would be out of this world. Asked him for a bite, and sure enough went back for 2nds and so on. SO TASTY!

Look forward to eating my way through this menu because what we've experienced so far, we love it! Happy to call Nathan's our Go-To Za establishment."}
{"text":"Love this pizza. Had Detroit style in Detroit, was racing about it so my wife looked it up and found we had one near us. Gave it a try and was not disappointed. Being from the east we like a cheesy greasier pizza. This fits the bill. Pizza that's like back east is a tough find in Las Vegas but we love this place. It's a thick crust, square pizza. We had the extra cheese and a guys and dolls and both were crispy around the edges and super cheesy. Guys and dolls was loaded with toppings and really good. 

You order at the window and they bring it to you. Nothing fancy but good pizza. Plus there's a pink box donut next door for desert"}
{"text":"One of the best deep dish pizzas ever. Just like Victory Pig pizza in NE PA. Nice atmosphere also with friendly service."}
{"text":"the food is good but lately the service is garbage. they CONSTANTLY mess up your order every single time and it's getting old. loyal customers are getting fed up. I don't know if it's new employees or what. when Todd was here it was great not anymore."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Vegas!   Their chicken fingers also rate number one with me.   I think it's a corn meal flour mix coating. The pizza crusty us amazingly crispy on the edges yet deep dish Chicago style.   Flavorful and not greasy (most pizza causes me to have gastric stress, but not this pizza nor the fingers)."}
{"text":"This place has awesome decor and a great pizza joint feel. I've never been to Detroit but the friend who lives in Detroit for a little bit whom I came here with said that this place is legit. 

For this place you have to go to the front to order. We didn't know so we say at our table for ten minutes thinking \"when is the waiter coming?\"  But food here is decently priced, especially the beer. Pbr was 1.75!  That's super cheap. We got 3 medium Detroit style pizzas and 50 wings with the ranch sauce.  Make sure you order the sauce cause it's house made and so good!!

The pizzas were good. Normally I prefer thin crust New York style but I thought it was yummy. We ordered the works, a pepperoni and mushroom one and the chicken jalapeño one. Thin crust is still my favorite though!  The chicken wings were bomb!  They were more like fried chicken wings because it wasn't saucy at all. It was deep friend, crunchy and juicy.  Not the traditional wings you'll see at Wong stop but I really enjoyed them!  Much more than the pizza for sure. 

I probably won't come here again because it was out of the way for me. Summerlin is too far and this place is not special enough for trek. But if your around the area and craving pizza and wings try this place out!"}
{"text":"So good! I recommend the Mozzarella Sticks and Chicken Fingers you won't regret it. They also have great hot sauce, Im not sure if it's housemade but it pairs well with the food!"}
{"text":"Came in for a bite before doing some grocery shopping at Whole Foods (I know, I know..pizza and WF sounds contradictory). 

They are doing lunch specials where you get a 6inch 2 topping pizza and a drink for $6.85.You can add fries or onion rings for $1 or a side salad for $2 and some change. 

We added on the onion rings and those came out pretty fast. Not bad, but a tad cooked too long so it was on the harder side of crunchy. 

BF and I got to share one with salami and jalapenos and one with meatballs and olives. The crust was crunchy and it came out piping hot and quick. It's \"kinda\" Detroit style, more inspired I feel, a bit different than what I actually can get in Detroit. What it reminds me more of is the deep dish my elementary used to make. That's not meant to be a bad thing- my school made fresh (not packaged Tony's frozen) squares with pepperoni bits and I thought that was the best thing ever.

It was a nice throwback to my school days, was decent of a lunch meal at a good price, but it isn't my preferred deep dish around. 

The server was nice as well so 3.5 stars. I'm a fan, but it is just a-ok."}
{"text":"Pizza was average and a little overpriced. Staff seemed 50/50 as far as friendly or just doing their job and waiting for their shift to end. My biggest issue was the silverware and plates, which are self-serve from a table near where food is ordered. I picked up FOUR knives that had crusted cheese/food on them; gross! And I had to dig through the stacks of plates to find three that did not have some type of crumbs or crusty food on them. It just seemed dirty and the server who brought our food didn't speak a whole lot of English from what I could gather so I decided to not mention it nor request speaking to the manager... so I doubt I'll be back. Plenty of other decent pizza joints in northwest Vegas and they are much cleaner!"}
{"text":"Ahh Detroit, home of the lust-worthy Ford Mustang, incredibly talented rapper Eminem, and sweet sweet old Motown music. Do you know what wasn't just on that list??? Pizza, that's what. And after trying Northside Nathan's, I can see why. Now I can come to one of two conclusions after eating there; either Northside Nathan's doesn't accurately represent Detroit style pizza (much the same way that a lot of \"New York style\" pizzerias in this town bear absolutely no resemblance to real New York pizza), or Detroit needs to stick to manufacturing the vehicles I love to drive, and leave the pizza to the big boys (New York and maybe I guess Chicago). 

The ambiance in this place is easily 3.5 to 4 stars. It's got a really cool decor. The service was also good. The counter girl was friendly and helpful. They also have lots of good promotions going on with coupons all over their website and on the pizza boxes. 

So those were the three redeeming qualities of Northside Nathan's. Unfortunately, after that everything came tumbling down. The crust was far from terrible, it actually was the most decent thing about the pizza. The most apparent problem was that the cheese was of the artificial blend variety. Whatever it was, I guarantee the box it came in didn't read \"Whole Milk Mozzarella\" or anything of the sort. The \"meatball\" topping was just that awful, flavorless crumbled ground beef topping. The sauce was barely existent, but maybe that's a good thing, because the little that I could taste was really sub par. I doctored it up with Parm, Red Pepper, Oregano, and Garlic Powder, but as Eminem once said \"Nurse, we're losing him. Check the pulse!!\" Alas, it was too late to save this terrible pizza. I won't swear off Detroit style pizza for good, but the chances of me returning to Northside Nathan's anytime soon are somewhere between Slim and Shady. 

P.S.- Something I learned from this experience... If a restaurant has a hard time not burning your fries, it probably isn't going to fare too well in the more difficult areas of the food menu."}
{"text":"We are former Detroiters who go out of our way, adding miles to visit this location on every Vegas visit, have posted pictures and recommended this place for pizza to many former Michiganders now living in AZ. Really looked forward to their pizza again last Wednesday, Sept 26.  Don't know if Malinowski from Warren MI sold the place, but the crust on our medium pepperoni pizza was not edible. The crust was dry and tasted like days old bread. We thought it was very strange when our pizza was delivered to our booth almost immediately after we sat down. It must have been precooked and left sitting. We were hot and  tired after riding the Harley 337 miles so we picked off the toppings, ate them, left and headed to check in to our hotel so very disappointed. Also, I used ladies room before leaving and the ladies bathroom had 3, yes three, visibly empty soap dispensers and no hand towels."}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza!!! Crust is perfect and the service is on point!! Never had Detroit style pizza before this but, I Would imagine this would be the standard!! So good we went twice in a week!!"}
{"text":"Service and delicious food go hand in hand...I just came in again because of our last experience...this time we brought my mom and sister. They loved Nathan's. Thanks. Love that fresh brewed tea! Our waitress was very attentive thankyou sorry we didn't get your name."}
{"text":"We walked in and went to the counter to say,  \"seats for two\". At that moment I realized it was an \"order here\" counter. I then saw all the self serve condiments, drink dispenser, plates, silverware etc. etc. The ordering of our food was the only restaurant human interaction we experienced while dining. It's an order here seat yourself restaurant. The Detroit sports' themed atmosphere was interesting especially being a former Detroiter. As for being raised in metro Detroit I was anxious to see Northside Nate's take on Buddy's Pizza, the square pizza king in the Detroit area. We ordered the antipasto salad and small four piece, sausage, pepperoni & onion pizza. I ordered it well done (for extra crunchiness) but not burned. OK, now the results and comparisons to Buddy's. The antipasto salad was very good along with the dressing. It was comparable to Buddy's. And now for the Buddy's pizza comparison....a drum roll please. Bottom line, the pizza was very tasty. It wasn't Buddy's but it was better than a few of the Buddy's pizzas I've eaten. To get closer to Buddy's, the crust needs more crisp and crunchy (more butter or oil? Who knows). The upper pizza was comparable though. All in all we enjoyed the food, ambience and will definitely try again."}
{"text":"This place is a little slice of Detroit, minus the Robocops and crushing unemployment rates.  Their hot wings are really delicious, but be sure to ask for more hot sauce if you're going to get them delivered.   They can be sparing at giving that up.

The pizza itself is okay, nothing super special -- though when hungover, it does magic.  Combine with the wings and NFL playoffs to create a really fun environment when eating there!   PS:  If you put a little ranch and hot sauce on their Guys and Dolls pizza, you will increase the deliciousness 10x.  

Definitely try it out on sports nights!  PS:  Large is LARGE.  Huge. Feeds three people and leaves half leftover."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great service, and reasonable prices.  We've been coming to Northside Nathans for years and have never anything short of an amazing experience here.  Food is always delivered hot n fresh and we never leave with any leftovers as the pizza is just so good.  Restaurant dining room has always been clean and there's almost always a selection of booths to choose from.  Also a great place to catch a football game on TV.  If you're living in the Summerlin or Northwest part of town and are looking to try a different take on pizza then check out this joint as you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"WORTHY OF A SLICE! 

The environment is great you instantly are taken to Detroit! The art work and collection of memorabilia is very unique and by the time you leave you can't help but feel like you've been to the D. 

THE PIE: I'll say the the look wasn't that impressive and the taste was average, it wasn't bad I actually ate most of the pie by myself. It said it was thin crust but it actually was more like a standard pie size, the cheese to sauce ratio was pretty even and I enjoyed the experience!

OVERALL: This is the kinda place I'd go to if I was in the area and wanted a reliable pie that I knew I could eat and be satisfied, the price was about right for the size and the service was on point. Keep up the good work northside and that means a lot coming from a westsider!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely  \"meh\"......had a pepperoni with chopped garlic, also an order of onion rings and garlic bread.  I\"ll start with the pizza first.  It was just a notch above supermarket stuff.  Not worth the money, won't be back.
The crust isn't my thing (too squishy and bleh), very bland flavor and I suspect the cheese on this  pie re-heated  for the second night is gonna be rubber.  (seemed to already be going that direction as I ate).  Could barely taste the garlic......it was there a bit, but not much.  Overall lacking in flavor and seasonings. Didn't even smell very pizza-ish.   The onion rings had practically NO TASTE which is difficult to do with onion rings, but they accomplished it here.  And the garlic bread was ......yucky.  soggy and not good.  I wish I'd saved the $34 this cost and bought a few grocery pizzas to shove in the freezer when I had a pizza craving....would have been just about as good.  Very disappointed because a lot of people apparently like this place but I'd skip it if you know the difference between good and meh pizza.  I didn't try anything else on the menu so maybe they do some things really well.....just not the pizza I ordered.  :( :("}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in Las Vegas for deep dish pizza. Consistent taste and quality. Great toppings. Great atmosphere (at least at the Lake Mead location). Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food just keeps getting better and better it seems.. The chicken pizza is to die for! Even the salad is good! Nice and fresh.. Customer service is excellent! Just a little pricey"}
{"text":"Headed here after a birthday party at Chuck E Cheeses, wasn't willing to spend $50 on 2 generic low quality pies (+ extras but still). It'd been a while since I was in and had enjoyed the pizza the two previous times I was here. Nathan's was my first \"Detroit Style\" pizza experience. Being a Native New Yorker I'm typically bias when it comes to pizza. We ordered the 6\" Gangsters Choice, 6\" Canadians Cup, and an 11\" Cheese Pizza. 3 Pizzas fed 5 1/2 people no problem with a $12  Domestic bucket for the ones that were of age. Honestly it was just the right amount of pizza with everybody leaving satisfied. Mum is excited to go back . Especially when it fed all of us for roughly $40 + tip. 

since it's not table service I tend to leave closer to 10-15%. 

The gal at the window wasn't the friendliest, but I can get over that.

 Might be a good low-key scene for football if they have the package."}
{"text":"Overpriced and underwhelming. We got a thin crust and a Sky Masterson pizza. The crust was tasteless and under cooked (Even the thin crust was doughy in the middle.) There was barely any sauce, which was not tasty. The sausage is the food service variety that looks like rabbit poop. For what they are charging, you expect a premium pizza. This was not what was delivered."}
{"text":"It's delivery but you should of got d'giorno overpriced and crap quality... took an hour which I don't mind waiting for a great pie which for $30 I expect it to knock on the door of greatness at least. Texture, ingredient quality and just about everything was a huge disappointment wish I would have gone to smith's and picked up a frozen pizza, honestly would have been better"}
{"text":"Always great food and friendly hot ,fresh Detroit style pizza and Detroit red wings are to die for."}
{"text":"I have to say so saddened by today! I've actually come weekly if not more since my post last month. I'll let the pictures speak for themselves. Might be time to find a new pizza place. :("}
{"text":"I will start out by saying that I am a former Detroiter who has eaten Buddy's Pizza my whole adult life. I have also sampled Detroit style pizza in NYC at Emma Squared and in Austin at 313. The restaurant is full of Detroit memorabilia  and fun. The menu is colorful and creative. We ordered a small antipasto salad and a 4 square Detroit Guys and Dolls. The salad was perfect. I loved the dressing and the meats and cheese were plentiful. We did not order breadsticks but otherwise, it tasted very close to home. It was a generous portion so we were able to save some to eat with the pizza. We loved the flavors in the pizza. The sauce was excellent. The cheese blend was good. The meats just right. The only criticism was the structure of the pizza. It did not match up to the original nor the other competitors. A square of Buddy's is very filling. I had one square of this one and let my hubby have the rest. I am gluten sensitive and shouldn't be eating regular pizza anyway. Buddy's offers a gluten free style in Detroit. Regardless, I live here now, so if I crave a Buddy's Pizza, this will suffice. I would give 3.5 stars if the app allowed."}
{"text":"This was my first experience here, I rate it a 7 out of 10. Only because the waiting time seemed to take a while and the edges of my pizza was very burnt. Other than that, I did like the wall decor and environment there. Music taste was unique plus they were playing Tom & Jerry so that's a plus and the Coca Cola was bomb there! Probably best I've had. The service was kind when ordering and when we left. Overall it was okay, but next time I definitely need the bigger size, the one I ordered I didn't think was going to be that small for $8!"}
{"text":"I must say they serve the best wings in vegas. Very crunchy and juicy. We had thin crust pizza, it was delicious but I just wish it had a little more sauce. They also have self serve drinks."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this pizza restaurant since it opened in 1998! We tried it the first week it opened and have been loyal patrons ever since.

My husband is from Michigan so we became fast friends with the owners and he always feels a taste of home when we come here. The decor is all about Michigan sports from the Tigers to the Pistons and even some homage to the Lions.... There is also a bar with video poker machines for those that just want to hang out and gamble. We come for the pizza!

The menu features pizza, wings, fingers, salads all with names from streets and places in Detroit and Michigan (really fun!).

The pizza always tastes fresh and the crust has the right amount of softness and crunch. The cheese literally melts in your mouth along with lots of other toppings to choose from. 

Hands down the best pizza in town!"}
{"text":"I love this place's pizza. They did get my order wrong. 

I wasn't very happy when the pepperoni, green pepper, and mushroom pizza ended up being a canadian bacon, sausage, and mushroom pizza. I let them know and they offered to replace it, but why does this happen to me so often?"}
{"text":"Close to my house so I like to go get their vegetarian or supreme pizza and enjoy a pitcher of cold beer with wings while watching sports on their numerous tvs.  The place has gotten a little pricier with the food quality not staying as good as it was, but I like the atmosphere, service and take out.  Big selection of pizzas available and this is what you come here for.  The other foods are just for those who want variety."}
{"text":"Not only is the pizza the BEST. The environment is great, small and quiet. Fast and friendly. Try the Caesar salad.. Great specials/coupons too. Love this place."}
{"text":"Solid 4 star pizza, my first time here brought by locals who told me it was a square pizza?! ok... cool retro vibe, great music, sports on tv, loving it so far, ordered wings they loved em... I didn't try Em! Out comes the square pizza and it's a ooey gooey cheesy hunk of heaven... seriously I never heard of Detroit pizza!! I'm kinda a pizza snob so they were watching me... I loved it!! Loved the vibe, the service, and well the pizza, that's what we came for right??!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place !! Really good ranch and wings. their 6inch pizza is perfect for one. Great tasting. Good clean place to eat and the service is good"}
{"text":"Ho hum....no idea what's the hoopla is all about, 
Had some take out (after seeing all the great revues) a pizza and some sandwiches.
The pizza was ok, nothing to write home about, the philly cheese was ok, not much there for the price, the italian sub was salty beyond belief, not sure how they managed to do that. 
All in all...and in MHO....I think whoever gave all the 5 star revues ...have very low standards. for the cost I expected something good, my fault."}
{"text":"on our quest to find the best pizza in LV, we recently tried Northside Nathan's.  We started with the small Antipasto salad advertised to serve 2-3.  Four of us ate plenty and still had some to take home.  It was tasty, topped with cheese and salami cubes.  We then ordered the chicken wings which were flavorful and crispy.  We ordered the veggie pizza and the roasted chicken pizza.  Both were good, but I would have like the sauce to be better..  I would come back again when I desire deep dish pizza, but we are still on the hunt for the best pizza in LV; as this was not it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food, and they deliver which is awesome. They could use updating on their restaurant but overall I've never had any bad service or bad food."}
{"text":"Second time here and I can't give it more stars. I planned to get their pasts this time but they only have spaghetti or ziti with choice of marinara or meat sauce. $1.50 more for meatballs and from what I saw (or didn't see) on the pizza, I passed. Tried the medium size Sky Masterson and still wasn't satisfied with what I got for the price.  Now they have mastered the pan pizza crust; top notch. But it had pepperoni, ham, sausage... no meatballs to be found. There are round pieces of sausage the size of corn kernels; if they call THAT meatballs I would have walked out ordering the pasta. Face it; this place is a sports bar so it should have sports bar prices. Now I can see coming in here Sunday afternoon, buying a bucket of wings (15.95 for 25) a beer and watching football. The place is great for that. They just need to take the \"Sumerlin\" out of it.
Things they can improve on:
1. Re evaluate the prices on most menu items
2. Put grated cheese dispensers on tables or the condiment stand. The staff shouldn't need to hunt one down for you when it should come with a pizza.
3. Turn on the closed caption on the TVs. Watching SportsCenter  doesn't help when they can't explain what the suspensions were this week.
4. They have a great video menu screen, but it changes too fast to actually READ the specials, menu items or when Happy Hour is. The only screen on long enough to read is the company offering the service."}
{"text":"I know Im a pizza snob and I have an extremely high standard when it comes to pizza, quality, quantity, freshness and ambiance.

This place definitely was average or a little less than average on all accounts.

We ordered a combo pizza with 4 different types of pizzas and the only thing I can say is that they are one step above a frozen pizza. Was nothing special about the pizza.

We also ordered a sampler platter and it was ok. Worst frozen onion rings Ive ever had. Chicken fingers weren't bad, fries were like frozen oven fries. But no Mottzeralla sticks?

Its a bar go and get a few drinks but dont come here for the pizza.

Ooh, they do have a sit down pac-man and a Gallaga arcade game. Get a drink and play a few $1 games but stay away from the pizza!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I can remember. (It's time to update the broken booth seats and just get rid of the extra games, they never work or are turned off) 
The food is great. Always finding myself craving the pizza and fries. Really good. 

They are always over turning staff- I mean almost everytime I come in there's a new girl up front which means I need to tell her where on the cash register to find my daughters motoscooter order, and ALWAYS need to ask for the drink that comes with it. Which is annoying.

Came in today to see they changed the straws- weird I know but let me explain. They are no longer wrapped, so they are all open for everyone's hands to touch when you go to grab one out of the container. This is seriously gross. 

Those few concerns aside, like I said pizza and fries make my mouth water and I order pickup all the time because of this. ( Delivery is always told at least a hour and I live up the street, that might be something to look into on their end ) 

So 4 star rating mostly for the pizza, fries, and ranch, one off for the concerns which clearly haven't been a deal breaker yet."}
{"text":"well be back there deep dish is nice along with there chicken wings more of a breaded texture vs what you see. a little pricey but ok. didn't realize they deliver to my location"}
{"text":"This is a pretty popping pizza joint. Whether you like regular hand tossed, chicago deep dish, fries, chicken strips, and other delectable greasy morsels. They have tvs all around the restaurant which you can view from the booths or bar counter. They also have outside seating for anyone who'd like to do people watching instead. Their deep dish Chicago pizza is worth a purchase and so is their deep fried pickles. So this is how it works, order food at window to the right when you enter, they give you a number, you find a seat and their team members in cool fedoras bring your food and get you anything there after. If you'd like a low maintenance place to watch sports, have some tasty pizza, this neighborhood family friendly establishment should be your final destination."}
{"text":"When I think of \"deep dish\", I automatically think of Chicago style where there are cheese and toppings galore.  Well, I'm not a pizza expert, nor have I ever tried Detroit style pizza before, I just love me some good pizza. 

And that is why this review is \"A-OK\".  There was just way too much crust for the amount of toppings in the \"Sky Masterson (pepperoni, ham, sausage, and meatballs) and \"Nicely Nicely's\" (chicken, garlic, and mushroom) for my liking.  Thank God the ranch dressing was delicious, because that was the only way that I was able to eat the leftover crust once my toppings were devoured.  If you like thick crust- then you'll love Northside Nathan's.  

We also ordered the chicken wings and those alone have me intrigued to come back.  We ordered take-out, but I still have a couple coupons and the atmosphere looks nice with all of the TVs- so I will try dining in, ordering a thin crust pizza instead."}
{"text":"Terrible food this time pizza was dried out ff too well done and very greasy and I asked for chicken fingers tossed in mild sauce"}
{"text":"OMG! I've had a lot of pizza in my day and this is by far THE best pizza yet. If I could give 10 stars I would. My taste buds are in heaven!!!"}
