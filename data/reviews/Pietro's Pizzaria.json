{"text":"Pizza and hoagies are amazing! But when I called to order, the guy taking my order just seemed grumpy and not personable. Fast delivery during dinner surge. I will frequently eat their pizza in the future"}
{"text":"We got a white pizza with pepperoni (but got no pepperoni) and a calzone. Both were pretty good. Just order VERY early, we called at 6:00 (guy who answered had 0000 personality) and was finally delivered at 7:40 (3 miles away). Delivery guy never uttered a word, just stood there with a box of pizza, good thing they told me my total when I called, I would have had to guess!  They also don't take credit cards-what a pain, still had to go out in the rain to ATM. Not worth the trouble"}
{"text":"Meh.  I had high hopes since we live so close but their wings are strange.  In a bad way.  I don't know how they made them, but they tasted like they were breaded then grilled or microwaved.  They were just...strange.  Pizza was neither good, nor bad.  Cheesy bread sticks are good, but,our go-to in the North Side was Riviera Pizza and Pasta's cheesy bread sticks. Those are just gifts from heaven so everything else pales in comparison."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza and good Italian hoagies too. We usually get the big one. It is a thick crust with a sweeter sauce and just the right amount of cheese. The delivery is fast and friendly. And the prices aren't bad either."}
{"text":"Rude, terrible service.  Grumpy.  Had a very bad experience with customer service.  Pizza is tasteless when you feel like a bad customer for just ordering."}
