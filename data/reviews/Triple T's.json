{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with the delicious food and great service given by Lindsey last night. The outside of the building is plain and austere, not very  welcoming. My friends and I ate the special, New York strip. My husband ate the Delmonico steak. All were cooked to perfection! The salad bar was filled with fresh veggies along with side salads as well as popcorn! Finally the prices were very reasonable!  We will come here again and recommend it to our friends."}
{"text":"Just stopped for a little lunch. Ordered the Rueben. The meat came in a big slice but was delicious and as tender as I have ever eaten. Bread toasted perfectly, one of the best Rueben sandwiches I've had in a long time.

Dinning room is very clean and is a nice place to eat. 

If you are headed east on Hwy 30 from Fort Wayne/New Haven stop and give it a try. 

I have been driving by this place for 10 years to and from work and have never stopped. I will be stopping and trying other items on the menu in the future."}
{"text":"We stopped and ate at Triple Ts today for lunch. It was very good. We did not find its location right away. The address listed led us to a cornfield 10 miles off the highway before we typed in the name of the restaurant and google maps brought us to it. It is located right off of highway 30. It is a metal building with no sign, just as others have described. We ate a breaded pork sandwich, and the buffalo chicken sandwich with cheese fries. Both were very good and staff was very friendly. They also have a yummy looking dinner menu with steak and fish as well as mainly sandwiches and burgers at lunch. They also serve pizza. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place on our way to Goshen, Indiana. There's no sign and it looks a little sketchy. Don't let that deter you.

The mushroom swiss burger was VERY good. My fianc√© had the philly cheese steak and my mother in law had the ruben. It was all great. Fries were great as well.

Many guys sitting at the bar. 

Over all it was a relaxing lunch."}
{"text":"Don't let the rough exterior faze you.   The interior is very warm and cozy,  and we were made to feel welcome.  We had the specials.  My wife had the fried fish,  it was tasty and piping hot.   My Delmonico steak was tender and cooked perfectly.   Salad bar was very good,  but they have it only on Friday and Saturday.   Baked potatoes are huge and baked just right.   Service was friendly,  attentive and prompt.  We will definitely return."}
