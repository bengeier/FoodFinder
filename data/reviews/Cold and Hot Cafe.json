{"text":"Revolting.  We bought one of the freezer burnt Popsicles.  Inedible!  Terrible service and old products."}
{"text":"Very weak service with a consistent lack of attention.  Food delivered at different times between my guest and I.  So much so in fact he had finished eating by the time I had food.  The food itself was bland. I had a crepe with turkey and cheese. Processed ingredients with a dismal side salad. It was at best 'ok'.  No drinks offered, I had to ask for water when my meal finally arrived. WiFi was offered but no one knows the password.  I really look forward when places open in this neighborhood but it would be really nice if they actually understand the restaurant business first.  I think they realized that I had a less than positive experience as they offered us some cake prior to departure but it also failed to meet the mark.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went for gelato pops for the kids and we were shocked at the freezer burn pops they were selling - looks like they had been there for a month! The baked goods looked equally aged! Kids tried to enjoy them - but it was a bust! I think we will stick to our home made ones - at least I know when we made them!"}
{"text":"The fruit popsicles are amazing!!! The owner is super knowledgable, and explained the process of creating each Popsicle. No powder or preservatives either...I'll be back many times this summer."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place and he has THE BEST fruit Popsicles...100% real fruit, no chemicals or anything else and they are incredible.  This is a must try...I recommend the raspberry, it was off the charts!!!"}
{"text":"Cool little spot in the area. The owner is a very nice man. There is a poster up front offering free sandwiches to people without money."}
