{"text":"We had the chicken dinner plate, it was delicious. Everything is so fresh, salad was great! Had the biryani rice... really good! Green Chutney is super spicy. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"So to all the concerned people and prospective customers... THIS IS A GREAT PLACE to eat and has no comparison to the last place that operates at the same location. So why can't the internet and web services like google and other food review places get that corrected in their database. The last place owner and food was crap.   This place is Nirvana for those wanting delicious food made fresh. My last visit there I saw the owner making fresh Hummus and we talked food. I love food and you know this guy does too. Most of the ingredients such as the turnips, hummus, pickles, cabbage and dressings / sauces are made in house.   Food is great have been 3 times this week and have told everyone about it.   Looking forward to everything on the menu."}
{"text":"The best shawarma I've had in the GTA to date. The food was fresh, delicious and prepared with care and attention to detail. Unfortunately its really close to the office, so I can see my self coming here once a week for lunch. Fatal. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing shawarma and chicken souvlaki platter!! Service was amazing - the second I left I commented that I've never had a shawarma made with such care - and it showed when I tasted it! Would probably drive out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"Came here as a fluke because we couldn't find The Works Gourmet Burger Bistro. We were driving around and I had crossed over into being hangry, hubby knew he needed to get me some good food right away.  Saw their special in their window: 2 shawarma wraps for $10.99 SOLD! Had chicken with everything on it. They had a genius way of wrapping it that kept things neat and prevented any drips on our hands (see pic). It was savoury and delicious: tender chicken, crisp veggies, soft pita, flavourful sauces with a nice kick of spice.   Not much in the way of decor or ambiance but it is fast food after all. Server was pleasant and a BIG plus is their free wifi!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and super friendly staff and great service.  They make sure each customer feels welcome.  The food is prepared fresh and you can taste the quality.  They have many options on their menu, and I can't wait to come back and try them all.  I also really like how they have fried pita crisps (that you typically have in fatoush salad) at the front that you can enjoy with your meal... very fitting with their name."}
{"text":"One of the best tasting shawarmas i have had...and trust me i have had a lot! Food is fresh and serving size is perfect.  A lot of shawarma places don't season the meat well and rely on a lot of sauces to give flavor. Fattoush's shawarma doesn't need any additional sauces...although their gatlic and green hot sauce are delicious"}
{"text":"I think I must have come on an off day because my experience is quite different from everyone else's.  I came here because of a few elite taste buds I trust rated this one at least 4 stars.  For me, the wilting pink edged lettuce, soggy and soft falafels, and lukewarm mushy potatoes, make me think they changed a lot since the other reviews.  This spot shares the same lot as the Brampton Courthouse.  So don't be surprised to see a lot of police cars about and if anything, it might make you feel safer.  Fattoush is a fast casual spot.  It's not very big or bright but it's functional and fairly clean.  It reminds me of most fast food spots.  Service here is attentive and kind.  You have a question or a request to swap... no problems.  Prices here are fairly reasonable, especially if you get the deal of the day.  My concerns came quickly when I spied the vegetables on display.. the lettuce looked old and already decaying with it's pink and brown edges.  Not a good sign.    Falafel plate with large salad & roasted potatoes - A very generous plate of vegetables topped with olives, pickled vegetables, peppers, and tomatoes.  There was 5 falafels on top coated with the requested garlic and hot sauce.  Unfortunately the brown and pink lettuce put me off immediately.  Also the garlic sauce was not garlicky at all and the hot sauce was super mild.  The falafels were not cooked either... mushy and uncooked in the middle with the outside being moderately crispy but more oil drenched.  I think they were cooked in a low temperature.  The potatoes looked good but they were really just lukewarm boiled potatoes with the 2 mild tasting sauces.  2.5/5  Hummus with beef - Another large dish of hummus that was generously poured in and topped with some beef that was reheated on the griddle.  Though it was a big portion, nothing stuck out as being flavourful.  I do have to mention the hummus was at least very smooth.  I'm not sure if they made it in house or not.  3/5  Falafel side - Same issues as the Falafel plate... undercooked, soggy, and oil drenched.  It's unfortunate and I seem to be looking for another spot for my falafel fix. 2/5  Overall, it seems to be run by a nice person but I think the execution and quality doesnt match what others have experienced here.  Perhaps a year later, things changed for the worst?  That would be unfortunate."}
{"text":"Had the chicken plate and was very impressed. Fresh ingredients and sauces were awesome. I do wish they included more meat and the biriyani rice could have been better but maybe I should have opted for the house rice."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good place to eat a late lunch, we found this place on yelp so we gave it a try. The guys at the restaurant are extra nice, my kids loved their Falafel, chicken shawarma, and kufta wraps. We had the Hummus for appetizer and the chicken shawarma plate special. The food is like home made! Loved the salad with the pickles. So coming back again."}
