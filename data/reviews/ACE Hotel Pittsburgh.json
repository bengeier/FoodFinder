{"text":"Worst possible hotel experience imaginable .
I paid full price for a suite ONLY to be kept awake by some horrid horrid sounding Brazilian band through the paper thin floors. 
DO NOT EVER STAY HERE."}
{"text":"Had dinner and drinks there last night. Food and dining waitstaff was excellent, loved the atmosphere. Almost had to arm wrestle the bartender for a drink though. It wasn't crowded or busy, just poor service at the bar."}
{"text":"Loved this hotel! Check in was easy; our \"medium\" sized room was huge. The decor and vibe of the hotel/rooms/restaurant was a nice change from the norm. 

We used to live in Pittsburgh and visit often so it's great to have a hotel in a neighborhood close to our friends and the places we like to go. 

Also so happy to have found a dog friendly hotel that's actually welcoming and dog friendly. Most accommodate dogs but make you use a separate entrance or exit, can't bring the dog to through lobby, etc. 

Everyone we met was really kind, helpful, and sweet to us and our pup. 

My only complaint is the weird hallway smell. Our room didn't smell and neither did the lobby or elevator, but the hallway had a weird cheese/molded smell. We asked about it and were told they recently changed something in the ceiling? Not sure exactly what that was."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a friend one afternoon. I am extremely disappointed with the food and experience.

First, our server was not knowledgeable of the wines that were on the menu and did not offer to sample any for us. We ended up getting wine that we hated and they have a VERY limited wine list for all of the hype of this place.

I ordered the traditional breakfast that came with toast. I told the waiter I didn't want butter, but he insisted I get it. It came and it was disgusting with a ton of butter. My eggs were not done and they were cold. My sausage and bacon tastes like they were sitting there for three hours extremely well done. Everything was cold. I will not be returning ever. I have lived in Pittsburgh my entire life and this was by far the worst meal I have ever had at a restaurant in my life and I go out about four nights per week."}
{"text":"My complaint is about the bartenders. I've had multiple bad experiences now. Overcharging from what the price is promoted as/giving the wrong change. Bartenders say what you ask for is sold out only to upsell without letting you know that they're selling you a drink that cost twice what you initially asked for. Very disappointed that the start of a night out has to begin with an argument with a bartender that is clearly in the wrong and so inconsiderate. Wish I would've asked to speak to a manager last night when one the bearded bartender tried to ripped me off in the gym."}
{"text":"Intimate, community based hotel that encourages locals as well as visitors to enjoy it's amenities (art, food, architecture, ambience). As Pittsburghers know, Monday can be a desert when it comes to finding a nice place to eat. Thankfully, the Whitfield is open on Mondays. Brunch is served seven days a week. Staff is charming and competent."}
{"text":"This place was incredible. The rooms looked kind of small and hostel-y from the website but they are super cute and weirdly functional inside. The staff really went out of their way to help me as I was staying with a dog. We hung out in the bar one night and it was really really packed. I didn't get a chance to try the food but I will be back for that."}
{"text":"Our lunch here was great. Chai tea donut holes were amazing and the table favorite. Carrot ginger soup of the day with crema and coconut pieces was interesting and excellent as well. Pastrami sandwich is what they are known for, but we enjoyed the roast beef sandwich with roasted peppers more. Both were excellent and above average. Great vibe and ambiance for brunch. The latte and mixed drinks were fabulous although a little pricey. Will be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I've heard many great things about Ace Hotel, so when I found out that one had opened here in Pittsburgh, I knew I had to check it out! As soon as you step into the hotel, you're greeted with a very warm, down-to-earth welcoming vibe. They have a restaurant and a bar/cafe in the lobby as well as a 'Gym', which is more of an event space I think (On the Friday we were there, they turned it into an area with games and drinks. They even have a photobooth in there!) 

My staycation was nothing short of amazing. We stayed in the suite, which wasn't extravagant like a normal hotel suite but it still had its own charm. I absolutely fell in love with the hipster/industrial theme with a hint of modernity that they were going for. The suite came with a guitar as well which was a nice surprise. Great amenities, very spacious and cozy. Every aspect of the hotel's interior is decorated very tastefully, even to the tiniest details. 

I didn't get a chance to try the restaurant or bar, but based on my positive experience in the hotel itself, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere.  Hostess was at first hesitant to give me a table since I was alone and there were couches where people can eat.  I really liked the baked grapefruit.  Interesting options on the menu.  Unfortunately, I got my latte luke warm."}
{"text":"Our room had a great view of the church. Loved all the extra touches and thoughtful design--mags, window seat and hooks to hang things. Bed was comfy and restaurant is fantastic. Fun social vibe in the bar and lobby. Would definitely stay again."}
{"text":"Don't stay here if you're traveling on business and want a good night's sleep....

Food is really good, service is nice. COMPLETELY ANNOYING that there is no sign outside telling you what the building is: there's clearly some interior designer in the company that prioritizes trying to be hip and cool over actual functionality and...I don't know...helping out of town people actually identify that this random brick building is the hotel. 

I'd stay here again if it weren't for the ROCK CONCERT happening in the auditorium, physically vibrating my room. Which is cool if you don't need to be at a meeting at 8am but it's a weekday so why would I consider whether or not a ROCK CONCERT would be happening at my hotel?? 

So, if you're in Pittsburgh on leisure and don't need to go to bed before midnight or wake up early, this is a great hotel. But if you have adult, work-related responsibilities, do yourself a favor and book the Monaco."}
{"text":"I save my yelp reviews for places that really blow me away and the Ace Hotel Pittsburgh just crushed the service these last couple of days for me. I couldn't be more pleased with a hotel stay! 

My travel plans didn't go as I expected (totally my own fault) so I was getting in to Pittsburgh about 10 hours later than I had planned. I'd alerted the Ace staff and when I was even later than than the first update I gave them, they called to check on me! After chatting with the desk agent, I decided it might be better if I changed my reservation to the next night. The hotel had the availability so he switched it immediately. He also set it up so I could check in exceptionally early the next day AND upgraded my room since I was having a rough go of it. Their service is seamless. Everyone in the building is exceptional at what they do and you can tell it matters to them. I love the koolaid they're drinking and I wish more businesses would follow their lead. Plus that shower tho! Omg. I'll seriously look for Ace Hotels when I travel from now on. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"So, it's been a long time coming that I spend a night with my lovely fiancé at the much talked about Ace hotel in Pittsburgh. Due to a lack of air conditioning in our heat box of an apartment, we decided to spend a night in comfort. The Ace Hotel did not disappoint. What began as a simple quest to find a safe haven from the heat, quickly turned into a friendly party with other hotel guests and patrons. Not only did the room exceed our expectations, but so did the cocktails, delicious room service breakfast, games and music in the gymnasium, and the service. Can't say enough about the service really. Bartenders, who were insanely busy, tended to us in a timely manner which, honestly, wouldn't have mattered. The drinks were definitely worth the wait if there was one. Front desk guys were super cool and informative. Door guys were Johnny-on-the-spots managing the door. And, room service was quick, friendly, and the food was delightful. And besides all of that, where else can you drink delicious bourbon drinks and shuffle through fun games in the gym such as corn hole and ping pong while grooving to sweet beats? My guess is nowhere. We will definitely be back. Four thumbs up!(me and my fiancé)."}
{"text":"I wish I had great things to say about this place but I really don't. Yes, the room was nice and the lobby was hipster cool but having people look down their nose at you is not my cup of tea. From the moment we walked in I knew that our colorful tattoos and laid back lifestyle was going to clash with all the black tattoos and dick tight jeans.
Our bathroom barn door wouldn't slide close unless we both pulled on it. Everybody raves over the bathroom care products, we didn't have any. Housekeeping never stocked them or forgot to put them in there in the first place. We left one morning and was gone for HOURS only to come back to our room door OPEN! When we let the girl know at the front desk and all she said was \"oh, I'll let someone know.\"
So from then on out housekeeping was locked out of our room till we left 3 days later. 
It is a nice hotel but I just don't think my husband and I were cool enough to be there."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Ace Pittsburgh last weekend.  Great rooms, dinner at Whitmore's was very, very good.  The bar was a real scene on Friday and Saturday, great service, friendly staff, and good drinks.  Its a loud, happening scene, and I felt like I was in Tribeca.  Also, enjoyed eating at some of the other neighborhood spots like Spoon and Noodles.  Wow, what a change since my last visit to Pittsburgh!  

Great job, Ace.  Love to see this happening in Pittsbrugh."}
{"text":"This is like all the other Ace hotels. Cool building with a hip interior design. Even if you're not staying as a guest, it's still a great place to hang out and get work done or grab brunch at the restaurant. I went on a  Sunday for brunch without reservations and there was a 45-minute? wait, so be sure to call ahead. Luckily there was seating at the bar."}
{"text":"My husband recently booked a weekend away for my 30th birthday. For the weekend away the Ace Hotel was our home front. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous inside, and a very scenester setting. So if your looking for a standard hotel, this isn't the place for you. We had reserved a Suite sometime in advance, so I was very eager to see our room. The room was very nice, a lot of sitting space which included two tables, a window nook, rocking chair, and also a bench. The views were breathing taking, as waking up to the beautiful sky on the 4th floor was probably my favorite thing. 

I think the major downfall to the weekend was the awful bathroom that we got in room 418. I believe it is one of the handicapped rooms, and it was utterly awful for my husband and I as the shower head hit us at the shoulder blades, and kept falling out of the holder every time we tried to move it. I actually had to position the sprayer towards the wall because it was spraying all over the floor. Squatting down to shower was a bummer especially after reading all the great reviews of the showers. 

I have to say the staff is some of the nicest people. Usually staff act like you are nonexistent, but every single worker acknowledged us and was super helpful and nice.  

The room service is amazing and I suggest trying out The Whitfield for breakfast... AMAZING! 

I would love to stay here again...just not in room 418."}
{"text":"I love this place. The bar is great. We can't really afford to drink here and are dive bar people but we do all the time anyway bc the drinks are so good and staff so nice. Michael is our favorite and so nice to us. Then the other staff- also great. I feel welcome here and appreciate the cheap beers too. I love coming here and send everyone here when they come to town. I appreciate what they're doing to offer cool programming and embrace local culture too. Yeah it's fancy and trendy but they're nice, hire nice people and I've never gotten attitude when I come in covered in sawdust after work. Glad they're here."}
{"text":"The bloody mary's are outstanding (especially with Boyd & Blair). Their version of eggs benedict is on point for Sunday Brunch. They surpass most E. Liberty business with their diversity policy & the space is gorgeous. However, those bar stools make you feel like you've been violated. Worst bar seating ever. Splurge Ace Hotel and switch those torture devices out!!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in Pittsburgh and great service I loved the honey brioche buns and the almond joy Ice cream was fantastic"}
{"text":"Great stay here. Mixture of rustic and hipster feel. Great for a weekend stay. Love the neighborhood as well great restaurants around the way and the front desk staff was wonderful"}
{"text":"All of the positive reviews below, to this point, are based on either coming to hang out and drink/eat or taking a tour, but not from the standpoint of being an actual overnight guest.

As a place to grab a drink/coffee, socialize, network and have a bite, this is a great spot.  If we still lived in Pittsburgh, we would definitely be visiting from that standpoint.

I preface all of this with 'I get it'...Ace is trying to be the hip/cool/party hotel....I get it.  Walking in, the first impression is that everyone working at the Ace looks right out of a Portlandia sketch...as though it is an exaggerated version of what they think people at the Portland Ace look like (it isn't...been there multiple times).  

We stayed for 5 nights from 12/27 - 1/1.  The rooms themselves are really cool, well-appointed and fabulous-looking when you walk in...especially, if you haven't seen/been to an Ace-like hotel before.   Design is definitely favored over practicality.  We did not spend a ton of time in the room and while it is great for a one/two night stay, I would not go back for a longer stay as it just is not comfortable from a long-term visit point of view.  

Our two biggest issues with our stay:
1)  The doorstops on every door in hotel (or at least on all of floor 5), which regulate how fast/slow the door closes, are so loose that each time someone enters/exits a room, a thunderous boom resonates through the floor and literally vibrates the room.  It seriously sounds like someone is slamming a door with all of their might each time a door closes.  Couple that with some folks coming in at 2/3AM and some leaving at 7/8AM and it makes for a very poor night of sleep as there is no way around the booms (even tried earplugs and a white noise app).

2)  NYE (again....I 'get it'...it's a party night)...people just openly partied in the hallways and not just partying, but really amateur screaming, yelling...like they belonged at an undergrad rental in South Oakland.  Around 4AM, a group moved into the room beside ours, jacked up the music/bass and went on with...just random screaming.  We called the front desk twice before someone was sent up to ask them to bring the noise down (it took 5 minutes of security pounding on the door before they could even hear it, to open up).  Security came to the group with a very meek, wishy-washy..'uh...could you please, possibly turn the music down a little?'.  They did not even do the obligatory gesture of turning it down while security was there.  Security left and nothing changed.  After another steady 30 minutes we asked to either be moved to another room or we were just going to check-out.  To their credit, they did move us to a quieter room, where we got our total of 3 hours of sleep for the night before we had to leave for travel.  However, it really just ruined NYD as we were totally exhausted.  While we appreciated the gesture of moving us to a new room, that was just a band-aid on the problem.  The solution would have been to shutdown the party b/c while we were able to sleep a few hours in peace, there was still a hall full of guests that had to contend with the party.

When we're back in Pgh, we'll likely visit for the atmosphere and vibe, but since there are some big flaws in the overnight experience, we'll definitely be going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Okay I didn't eat here so this review is just of the bar and the open gym. First, the space is very eclectic and open. The drink menu is interesting and their old fashioneds, while a little sweeter than I like, are very good. 

The reason this place gets 5 stars is because the open gym is so rad! They kept the old YMCA basketball court and repurposed it as a play space for adults. There is ping pong (my favorite), corn hole, Nintendo game ish stuff (all video games are Nintendo to me), and other board games.

I will definitely be back and this place will be a go to when I have friends visiting. Well done, people."}
{"text":"Super quirky and beautiful hotel. Great bar + cocktails. Super accommodating + friendly staff. Honestly, the only gripe I had was with the parking situation which I just ended up parking at the meter for an hour till it was free (after 6 pm?). On the whole, I had a great experience and I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"No hotel is for everyone but this one suited me perfectly.  Recently spent three nights here and had a near flawless stay.  If you are into the staff all being in a uniform and kissing your butt at every turn, the Ace may not be for you.  The staff comes to work in whatever makes them comfortable, no dress code and while it may be super casual, everybody and everything ran well and odd requests were met with \"not a problem\"!  Everyone I encountered were super nice, warm and naturally friendly.  The building is a retrofitted, early 1900's YMCA and some many of the old elements are preserved while still managing to be up to date!  I had the smallest room of the room categories and it was plenty big for me.  The ceilings and windows are high, giving the feeling of even more room.  The bed and bedding were super comfortable with four extra long and soft pillows.  My only little complaint is that there were no USB ports to be found in the room for charging devices but plenty of standard power outlets.  As others have mentioned, parking is a bit of a drag and the $25 per night (with unlimited in and out) valet can add up.  The food I had in the restaurant was excellent and so was the Stumptown coffee they serve at the cafe.  All in all, I hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"We thought we'd try dessert at Ace. Boy were we surprised. Not just an extensive dessert menu, but also dinner, drinks and wine.
We ordered 2 different kinds of ice cream sandwiches. Yes, you heard me right...2. as well as an olive oil chocolate cake. 
YUM! Such different items. They really took care in creating a unique dining experience.
The dinner menu looked really good. We will have to get back. 
4 stars and not 5 because it was really loud. Lots of people; Lots of noise."}
{"text":"The Ace is a stylish and funky small hotel located in the East Liberty district.

They have done a wonder job of connecting the hotel to the local community through art commissions and programming. 

One entire floor of the hotel is occupied by the gym. This hotel has lots of cool amenities!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend surprised me and took me here for brunch- I had no idea this place existed and was so intrigued by it. Yes, it's a hotel, and I'm sure it's an awesome one. The ambiance is classy, yet rustic and modern. The dining area is pretty large and it wasn't as crowded as I thought it might be on a Sunday morning for brunch. I started with the Nitro cold brew from Stumptown and it was my first ever nitro coffee experience. The head on the coffee was unbelievable- it was so fresh. I haven't had a better cup of nitro cold brew anywhere else. It was incredible and I didn't need to add any creamer to it. I also had the bruleed grapefruit, with seasonal berries, which was so incredibly delicious. I loved every bite. For my main entree, I had the mushroom gravy & biscuits with pea shoots- it was super tasty. I really enjoyed it. The biscuits were flaky, yet withstood the gravy nicely and didn't fall apart when I ate it. My boyfriend had the Whitfield Breakfast and loved it. We both had a great experience here overall and I'm dying to come back. Side note- the gym in the back of the Ace Hotel is awesome and I am dying to come to an event here!"}
{"text":"This was my first time staying at a boutique hotel, so you could say I approached it with a healthy dose of skepticism.  With its records playing in the lobby, felted \"do not disturb\" signs, and urban-eclectic decor, Ace Hotel almost seems like a parody of hipster culture.  That being said, it is a really comfortable place to stay in Pittsburgh.

Despite the bougie-ness, the staff were friendly & helpful, the room was cozy, and the bed was comfortable. The shower worked well, and the bath products they source from Rudy's Barbershop are really nice. This hotel is missing a few amenities: despite the former YMCA \"gymnasium,\" there's nowhere to work out, and parking is valet/street only.  But for a short stay, these are minor inconveniences.  And Ace Hotel makes up for it by running \"activities\" (movie screenings, live music, dodgeball, etc.) almost every night.

The room service menu sounded tempting, but I wasn't in love with the carrot bread with goat cheese I had for breakfast one day.  The restaurant and bar seems to draw a lot of locals, so I probably just ordered the wrong thing.

You can tell that this hotel is a gentrifying force in the neighborhood: a taxi driver told us that a soup kitchen in the church across the street closed after the hotel moved in, which is kind of sad.  But it's not like the neighborhood is unsafe at all, and there are plenty of cute restaurants, shops, and bars in nearby Shadyside.  It's also a short walk to the express bus, which is super convenient for getting to downtown Pittsburgh in only ~20 minutes.  Overall, if you don't mind the hipster vibe, Ace Hotel is an accommodating and comfortable place to stay in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"This is the coolest hotel I have ever stayed in!  They took an old abandoned YMCA building and turned it into a trendy/swanky/hipster hotel!  The design is awesome!  They still have the gymnasium but it's outfitted with a huge projector screen and there is cornhole set up, and a photo booth (we are suckers for photo booths).  The rooms take cues from the 1950's (record players with a stack of records to choose from, a guitar hanging  from the wall, claw foot cast iron tub and a walk-in shower that looks kinda like you're at the gym). The lobby has a full service restaurant which looks fantastic, and a James Beard award nominated pastry chef.  They have full bar open til 2am (even on Tuesday) and a lobby full of comfortable seating and games to play!  Can't say enough about this place!"}
{"text":"The Ace Hotel in Pittsburgh is a true gem. First off, the space is amazing. It's a really awesome rehab of a YMCA. I love how they play off of the buildings history yet at cool and functional features to give the place a welcoming vibe. In addition to a great space and nice rooms, the staff is really friendly and helpful! I was driving in from NYC late and they went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable / accommodate me. Overall, I'd definitely recommend staying here while visiting Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I stayed 2 nights and felt really pampered.  It's the old YWCA building, and there are little sheets pinned to the walls explaining the history.  The rooms are hipster cool, and I love the Rudy toiletries --and especially the Malin + Goetz skin cream!

My 1st night-- lo and behold, the problem with construction at the Presbyterian Church (described on Yelp) reared its ugly head again!  I arrived after midnight from Los Angeles for a late check-in, and by the time I was in bed-- it was 3:00am.  I was awakened by a low and dull thumping at 7:15am-- which continued until 9:30am.  I put in ear plugs and stayed in bed until 10:30am.  (3 hour time difference made it 7:30am PST).  When I complained to the front desk, they comped me $50 for meals, and moved me to an inner room the 2nd night.  I slept like a baby.  I would highly recommend for the personal attention!"}
{"text":"Adorable botique hotel. Came for a quick weekend and got the deal on the suite for two nights. We could bring our dog for only $25 more a day so we brought him along. The bar downstairs is even pet friendly and he was definitely mr popular whenever we took him down with us. Also those with dogs ****the church across the street has grass but they have an actual pet relief area you should use. Just go to the right when you walk out hotel door just around the corner of the church.  
The suite is cool and quirky with a big claw foot tub and a record player and guitar on the wall. I brought a bath bomb and I tell you it's a must. The shower is stocked with great shampoo, conditioner and shower gel. I love when hotels do this over small one use bottles. I never get enough conditioner otherwise and the products here are much nicer. This concept is also green which I like.
The staff was great in every area from valet to room service to front desk. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has quality on lockdown. Atmosphere, flavor, service, craft food and craft cocktails. You can't go wrong eating or drinking here.

Thanks for doing Pittsburgh right, Ace Hotel. We love you."}
{"text":"Ace Hotel is a very cool place. It's an old YMCA converted into a restaurant and a bar. It is also a hotel. The food is of high quality. The drinks are exceptional. I had the mushroom gravy and house made biscuits with grilled spring onions and Pea shoots. I have had it before and ordered it again because it is that good. My husband had pastrami hash with an egg and a caramelized grapefruit with fresh berries. We also had a dessert of three house made donut holes with caramel sauce. Our server was a really nice guy. I'm sorry I don't remember his name. He was attentive and happy. I love this place and would love to go in for dinner."}
{"text":"A nice hotel, but it felt like the target clientele was the sort of people who don't stay in hotels that much and are expecting an experience rather than traveler amenities. I mean, the room I was given was made up to look like maybe a musician's apartment (guitar on the wall, blank music sheets on the desk, etc). It was quite charming, really. 
On the other hand various little things weren't working, like one of the shower fixtures. The sink soap had a tag attached telling me I could buy my own downstairs. Awesome. But the shower only had those down-market liquid soaps. And so on.
But don't get me wrong: the bed was comfortable and the pillows were fluffy. The room was quiet. There was a nice view out the window. Maybe the right destination for that week-end getaway."}
{"text":"This was my first time staying at this hotel and I was incredibly impressed from the staff to the food to the service. They accommodated all of our needs, evening large very late night dinner order.  The shampoo and body wash smell amazing!"}
{"text":"Very hipster.  If you love that vibe then go.  If you don't  don't...REALLY.

If you are agnostic, then I'd say it can work, especially on a short trip where you're looking for something different or want to help support the resurgence of the area.  This is not a spot for luxury or anything of the sort.  For that you may want to try the dahntahn spots.  Here you will get fairly easy going, decent nights sleep, low bed, Wigle Whiskey in the minibar (now that's actually pretty cool).

Parking not an issue I was there for 3 nights and did on street with no tix at night the entire time.  Neighborhood (for tourists) is transforming - not great, not scary, just a local neighborhood and very unpretentious (but so is the B generally).

Restaurant is great, fantastic food, excellent service and lots of activity.  I would encourage reservations (as soon as you check in) if staying over a weekend.  Even if you don't use it, it's good to have becuase it is a bit of a hot spot otherwise."}
{"text":"Came in for drinks a few weeks ago after hearing the buzz. It was pretty crowded (it was a Friday night) but we somehow managed to find a place at the bar. I'm not sure the space is used effectively for housing as large a crowd as it draws.

The bar staff is friendly and fun, and they really care about making something you like - I am always a fan of that! I really appreciate it when a server says \"you don't want that thing - you want this other thing\" and it's not because the other thing is more expensive or whatever. I stuck with drinks because I'd already eaten, but the food menu looks intriguing.

I'm not so much a fan of the prices of everything, but I have a feeling that this is the new normal for bars in East Liberty :/

I'd love to come back, but I'd be more likely to do so if they started a happy hour and/or late night special thing."}
{"text":"Came in a chill Monday. Tremendous bar program. The bartender was attentive and the drinks were on point. Can't wait to come back and try more of the daily punch options. Love this place."}
{"text":"I'd give a 1.5 but round up to 2. Cool rooms that evoke the hotel's yesteryear as a YMCA, but are a a lot more comfy. Great windows, view of the church across the way. Near some restaurants, has a great-but-expensive-for-Pittsburgh bar. 
So, why a low rating? Expensive rooms, lack of usual amenities (hey, no lotion?? Do hipsters not get dry skin??). The kicker:  super duper loud! The bar/restaurant noise was audible in our 3rd floor room. And second night they had a techno concert on the floor below ours. When I called about it, they were nice but like, \"oh, you can hear it?\" They moved us up one floor, could still hear it, but we dulled the sound through a white noise app and ear plugs. If you do stay, ask for the 5th floor, and check the calendar for concerts."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Family style steak - enough said!   This is a carnivore's dream, and all the sides were wonderful too!"}
{"text":"Loved this YMCA refab in ACE.  There is so many things going on there.  Monday night dodge ball, no kidding, like from high school days.  Disco dances, private DJ parties, private events, on site catering.

Please do stop for a handcrafted cocktail, they are truly an experience to be had."}
{"text":"Omg guys and girls go to this place 4:30pm to 6:30pm the happy hour is so great they have super yummy fun cocktails like The last one standing  and The fairweather so Refreshing... O and the apps is a must try the corndog and chips , burger  and the French onion dip with chips  only like 5$ to 8$ so grab a group a friends and have a great time 
So check this place out my YLEPERS !!!!"}
{"text":"Great cocktails! Refreshing, modern, laid-back atmosphere. I plan to visit the cafe in the daytime."}
{"text":"Hipster Mecca. Staff was exceptional. Rooms are great, perfect size for a short trip. Location in Shadyside is ideal, can walk to several bars and restaurants but why leave when you have the bar downstairs? There is a photo booth in the gym, be aware it takes photos immediately, no delay. 10 out 10 -  would recomend, and will stay again."}
{"text":"Great concept turning the local YMCA into the newest Ace Hotel. Keeping the gym feel was a cool touch as well. It's a mix of hipster hideaway meets after school program.

The bar is great. Friendly staff and good drinks. The fourth River mule is definitely worth trying.

The lobby was jam packed with people. Lots of seating options for people to kind of just hang- which makes sense since first and foremost it's a hotel.

With all the hustle and bustle of the lobby, I don't think I could ever stay at the this Ace. I don't think I would ever feel at peace with all of the noise, but maybe that's why people go there? Maybe I'm too old?  Or maybe I should just take an Ambien before I go to bed. Either way, it's a cool place to check out at night."}
{"text":"I surprised my wife for her birthday by bringing her to the Ace hotel for a night (Thursday-Friday). The surprise was a hit! Ace has a reputation of quality, uniqueness, and design. You get all of those things from the moment you pull up to the front door of this great hotel (former YMCA building). 

1. Valet parking - great experience and $25 a night. 

2. Lobby - Whitfield restaurant to the left, bar and seating to the right. The Whitfield is extremely good and priced high. The bar is a bar with a happy hour available (4:30pm-6:30pm, daily). The burger is $10 during the happy hour and that's a great deal! Everything is designed smartly in the lobby, and it is a great place to catch up with friends in the evening or to relax and read in the morning. They serve Stumptown coffee (you have to pay for it), which, if you like coffee, is a fantastic coffee roaster. 

3. The room - we got the medium size room. Great, great, great design to the room. Bathrobes. Great view. Excellent smelling soap (this is a must for me). Extra things to purchase from the room. Room service, etc. The bed was very comfortable (firmer than most hotels, which I like). Tv was small. 

4. Check-in time is 3pm and check-out time is 12pm (I love this later check-out time). 

5. Within walking distance to the best restaurants East Liberty has to offer.

The service at this hotel is great. I let them know the occasion for our stay and there was a handwritten note wishing my wife a happy birthday, 2 free coffee coupons, and a bottle of fancy water (probably harvested from Middle Earth or something). Great experience there. 

I gave the hotel 4 stars because, at face value, its priced too high. I reserved a room when there was a promotion and I paid $150 for the medium size room (after taxes and such). You'd probably pay $30ish more on a regular day, and that price isn't worth it to me. It's just not. BUT it seems they run promotions all the time. 

Stay at the Ace. If you appreciate design and quality service . . . Stay at the Ace. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Cool, over the top hipster hangout with a lo of cool art and shows in the old school sort of literally gym turned art exhibit and concert space.  You will find an interesting variety of artists, hipsters, and urban fashionistas hanging out and some intelligent conversations about politics, art, and the illuminati.   bar tenders are friendly but they fairly expect some effort from you to engage in conversation.  Definitely check out the VIE visual art and media festival in the Fall (I'm assuming it will be held here again - perfect place for it)"}
{"text":"I got a chance to check out Ace Hotel. The atmosphere is wonderful. I love the hipster idea! It was very welcoming and the people that work there are so down to earth and fun. It was definitely happening up in there on a Monday, with a DJ! WOW! I got a chance to try a few select appetizers that were delicious!!!!!! The Carrot Au Gratin was heaven on a plate. I definitely will come back again to for a ladies night out with my friends. And order more food and drinks. OH, and the Moscow Mule and Industry Punch was sooooooo good!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was only at the bar for this review, but the experience was pretty good. My group sat at one of the collections of couches and chairs, which gave enough comfortable space for all five of us. The seating areas were spread throughout the lobby, but I didn't feel like I was going to be overrun by hotel business. The decor is bright, styled with mid century modern pieces, and overall the atmosphere is very inviting. My only complaint about the room itself is that when the sun is almost down (around 8:30pm), it becomes very dark inside, and they don't adjust the lighting at all.

Everyone ordered a drink, and the waiter was very nice. He was prompt about bringing a wine sample to one person in my group who wanted to try something before deciding. We felt that the drink selection was good - there was enough variety for something for all of us. We also ordered a few small plates. First, we ordered the duck fat kettle corn. It was very delicious, although it tasted like normal kettle corn to me. We also asked for two orders of pirogies. Each order came with three pirogies, so we ordered two because there were five people in my group. At first, we only received one. The pirogies were very delicious - they used a blend of cheeses for the filling, and the cooked them so the outside was just a tad crispy. After receiving the first plate, we asked if our second order was coming out. Turns out, the waiter had misunderstood our order and only put in one plate of pirogies. After asking, he put in the other order and it came out quickly, so it ended up being not a problem. 

Overall the experience was a good one and we had lots of fun. I deducted one star for the food mixup and the lighting, but I still feel that those were minor issues and will definitely be returning in the future!"}
{"text":"Here's my expectation: A hotel is a vacation, whether you're booking it as a staycation a few blocks away from home, as a rainy-day-jar experience in a new city, as a refuge for your bags while you're traveling, as a safe space while visiting relatives, or as a hole-in-the-wall what-can-I-afford while getting lost wherever you end up. With all of the hype around the new Ace Hotel in Pittsburgh, it seemed like the perfect getaway--a repurposed old building in the heart of the East End, excited and hip staff to pair with the unique rooms, and a price point that says \"I need to be taken care of\" without saying \"I need to be pampered and spoiled.\"

Here's what I got: The room felt like a dorm room. It had a beautiful view, but the shade didn't go down the whole way to cover the window. Even though we were on the third floor, we could hear the party going on in the lobby/restaurant/bar well after we'd had our fill and closed the door. There weren't any tiny soap bottles or bathroom amenities to bring back with us as a memento, which is something small that I appreciate about visiting hotels. The hand soap was a black mini-tile with a tag hanging from the mirror, and I didn't realize it was a bar of hand soap (and even went so far as to ask about why there wasn't hand soap when checking out...I am so sorry). The blanket was awesome, but the sheets were coarse and the bed was very low to the ground. The TV didn't have a sleep timer. I don't think they offer room service, and there isn't any enticement to eat there the next morning--they offer Stumptown Coffee (yum), but you don't get any complimentary morning perks for spending the night.

I feel like the minimal, elegant design and delicate, articulated brand created the guise of being taken care of without providing the amenities to accomplish the goal. Is this the new expectation? Am I being too greedy in wishing my parting souvenir was more than a matchbook? Am I being too harsh in hoping for some nice body wash, lotion, or a good pen to take with me? A stay at Ace isn't inexpensive, but I can spend less and stay a few minutes away at a Hyatt--get a studio room with a King bed, some nice in-room amenities, a gym to work out in after work, and a small-bite plus coffee spread in the morning.

I don't want to sound like I'm complaining, and I fear that this review impresses a really awful personality onto myself. The staff were extremely friendly and I had an awesome time making the most of my night. I just don't believe the hype. I wish I did; I just don't."}
{"text":"Love that I can go into this great community space for coffee, brunch, a drink, whatever and be greeted by friendly, unpretentious folks."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to work from. So this review is primarily about their lobby area.

There's plenty of diverse seating in the lobby, and there's something about the white walls + light green accent paint + greenery that make this place especially soothing. 

The coffee is exceptional, and the aesthetic inspires.  One of my friends only drinks chai tea lattes at coffee shops, and he confidently states that this is the home of the \"best chai tea latte in Pittsburgh.\" What I really love about this place is the passion that some of the baristas have shown. On several occasions they have taken the time to create their very own twists on traditional coffee staples, and the experiments have always been a win. My favorite was the \"Fall Spice\" blend that one particular barista created to add some flavor to an otherwise-ordinary latte. 

But this place goes beyond the coffee. It's a hotel (obviously), it's a wedding venue (my friends got married here and it was INCREDIBLE), it hosts the ever-delicious Whitfield restaurant, and it's a hang-out spot amongst tourists and locals alike. 

Special tip: go to the bathroom at least once while you're here. The soap smells incredible, haha"}
{"text":"What is pretty fabulous about this place is that they have turned an old YMCA into a hotel (still definitely feels \"old\") with a super trendy bar/restaurant area and allow access to their gym area for board games, ping pong tables and corn hole tosses! While I have not stayed at the hotel, I have frequently visited their lobby bar to enjoy their drinks and have played a few games of ping pong in their open gym area. This place is actually a lot of fun! Fun place to take your hipster buddies for drinks in a renovated building and a fun place to take your attention deficit friends for action and games too!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this hotel chain! The room is functional in such a fun quirky way! The hallways are soft and inviting & the lobby is fun and lively! The coffee at the coffee bar is excellent and the drinks are worthy of posting to Facebook! I'm in love with everything about this place. And it's central and walking distance from everything."}
{"text":"The Ace is beautiful! Wonderfully restored old building, adorable rooms and great food & coffee! What more could we ask for?"}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed here for a night for a little kid free getaway.  We arrived in the evening after work.  The lobby was LOUD AS HECK, but the man who checked us in was friendly and welcoming.  We'd read on some reviews that the hotel was loud and thus were a bit nervous based on the lobby scene, but the upstairs portion with the rooms was very peaceful and quiet.  (NOTE:  The door slamming issues mention below much have been fixed.)  Our room was great, bed comfortable, there were cool things to look at, and the bath products smelled great.  Check out was easy and they even adjusted our bill to include a \"locals\" discount.  The only reason I am giving 4 instead of the 5 stars, was because the lobby bar was full of insufferable hipsters (although the bar tenders were great) and the food (at the bar and in the restaurant) was adequate at best.  Overall we loved the look, feel, and location of the hotel.  The building was gorgeous.  I would come back."}
{"text":"Haven't stayed here but their cafe is really great! It's such a relaxing and pretty place to eat or sip on coffee."}
{"text":"Met friends for drinks and bar snacks on a Monday night. All the drinks were exceptional! Great snacks, we had the pickled deviled eggs and the french onion dip with housemade chips. Got a great seat at a table in the lobby area. It was a long wait to get the bartender's attention, but we had a lovely time!"}
{"text":"I've had breakfast/brunch twice now at the Ace's in-house restaurant, the Whitfield and I have to say their version of Eggs Benny is by far one of the best I've had in quite some time. The interior and building itself are so beautiful, and really spectacular job in refabbing this historic site. I'd like to go back for dinner at some point, and maybe check out some of the social events/programs at ACE."}
{"text":"The Ace Hotel is a wonderful down to earth place to stay in East Liberty. We decided to visit it and since was the aftermath of Christmas we were able to get free parking in one of the lots.

The hotel is located on S Whitfield St in the former YMCA building. When we entered we looked around and saw many antique looking furniture as well as a record player, board games, a lounge area, a restaurant and a bar on the other side.

We went to the front desk and they arranged for my husband and I to have a tour of the place. Our tour guide's name was Zeke and he gave us some background information on this hotel. He noted that it is a work in progress and not everything is completed yet.

We first toured the ballroom with can be sectioned off if you want to rent an area for a private affair. They have retained the original black and red tiles in the ball room as well as in the elevator and even in the public restrooms. 

He then took us to see a suite. The suite we visited had a ceramic tile bathroom, however, it had  outside the bathroom and old style bathtub to lounge in. Also it has an honor bar, a record player with records, as well as nice views. The bed is a foam mattress that sits in a frame so there is no box spring.

Zeke went on to explain that they use furniture they purchase in the strip district which is old style and update it a little to give it an antique feel. As in most hotels you are given rental bathrooms which are available for purchase at the front desk along with some other things.

The final room he showed us was the gym they are working on. We couldn't enter here since it is currently under renovations. I asked about parking. Zeke told me that they hope to have valet parking available around Jan. 6th so that visitors could make use of that service.  

He took us down some stairs and told us to be careful since he wanted to show us some pictures of the East Liberty heritage.

Our tour ended so I inquired about prices. One night's stay can range anywhere from $300.00-$400.00 night depending whether you pick a room or suite and the type requested. Currently they are offering a 25% discount through Mar. 16 if you are living in the Pittsburgh area on the room rates.

The Ace hotel is an expanding chain with hotels in major cities such as New York City, New Orleans, Los Angeles, Palm Springs, Portland, and Seattle. Sorry Atlanta-you don't have one yet.

I love the concept and it is a very nice hotel for the price you would pay for a mid range chain hotel in a major city. It houses the new Whitfield restaurant where we had lunch and is near public transportation. Bike parking is also available. We were glad to make our first visit here!"}
{"text":"Meh. Cute inside but slow service. Ok drinks but not anything great. Would give it another try and try the food."}
{"text":"What a cool hotel. A real change of pace from the traditional business stay hotels i frequent for work that cost much more. I stayed here for pleasure not business so cost was a concern. I was not expecting how nice of a room and hotel experience in general for the dollar value. I give the cost/quality a A+ 

This hotel is more of an experience than just a place to sleep. Old school touches that they cleaned up but never changed are super cool. The place is still being worked on but that didn't bother us. I would describe it as a \"hipster feel\" guitars on the walls and a record player in your room. 

We didn't even need to leave the hotel to find a cool bar to hang out at. The party was right here."}
{"text":"In a landscape made of chain hotels, Ace Hotel sticks out. Unique interior design, nicely sized rooms with quirky interior (my room had a guitar and a vinyl player, and of course, vinyls), located in the revived East Liberty neighborhood. The hotel also has a hip restaurant (think duck patee) and a bar (open till 2am, and with LIVE MUSIC).

The hotel took over a former YMCA building and is part of a speedious re-urbanization of a neighborhood that used to be a retail center with theatres and plenty of shops in the early 1900's. With Google and Carnegie Mellon closeby, the Ace is another sign that modern times have arrived in East Liberty.

I love this boutique hotel but be aware of two things: Parking is only available on the street (2 hours max), or you can valet for $25/day. Also, the prices really differ by day so make sure to play around with your dates if your travel time is flexible."}
{"text":"Let me clarify- this review is for the bar only (Not the hotel or the adjoining restaurant).

3 stars for this place because, well, some nights it's 1 star and sometimes it's 5.

Things you should know:
+ this place is dog friendly, which is great for people like me; But if you're not pooch friendly or you're allergic, this might not be the place for you. I've been there when there have been up to five dogs at the bar (though I've only seen that many dogs there once- that was the five star night). Also there's a chance there will be a person bar who insists that the nice (stranger's doggie) can sit on their lap, at the bar. Yes I am that person and yes I know it's unsanitary. 

+ The cocktails and liquor selection are pretty good

+ The duck fat popcorn is amazing.

+ The food on the bar menu is just OK and it's not very exciting, but you can ask to order off of the restaurant menu - most of the main entrées are amazing and come with fantastic sides.

+ The service decides the night here. Sometimes it completely sucks there are a handful of bartenders that just are not interested in you, what you want, or while you're there. This has happened to me more than once. The other bartenders and servers are amazing will tell you jokes as you sit around and can recommend fantastic drinks.

It's a little noisy but generally a good ambiance. Oh and don't be surprised the inside looks like a former YMCA.... turns out that is because it is an old YMCA. Huh, imagine that."}
{"text":"I've been to Ace Hotel a couple of times for events and the bar. I wanted to wait to review until actually staying there which I did this past weekend. 
For the events I've attended the space was perfect. The former gymnasium is the ideal spot for larger gatherings. The lobby bar is laid out nicely with comfortable seating and board games; makes you feel like being at the best house party in town. Bar prices are  a little higher but not too terrible ($8-$10 average for a cocktail). Even on a Friday night when the place is jam packed, service is quick, friendly and accurate. We've also eaten burgers and fries (different visit) and I have to say they were really tasty; juicy, fresh and mouthwatering. As far as the actual hotel rooms and stay...I'm in love. We live a ten minute walk from Ace and thought it would be fun to stay a night during my birthday weekend. We weren't let down at all. I love the room concepts and the simplicity of the design. Simple and tasteful. Basic but not in a bad way, at all. The building is a former YMCA and the rooms echo and honor what once was. That's the beauty of it all. Refurbished, reused, recycled. Dare I say perfection? The mini bar is stocked with local beers and alcohol and the treats range from Zagnut bars to ramen in a cup. Room service available too. Bath products are courtesy of Rudy's Barbershop and Pearl Luxury Soaps...totally to die for. The shower head is EVERYTHING! The room robes are hoodie-style and so soft and comfortable. We had the \"small\" room which is actually a nicely sized space with an incredibly comfortable king bed. 
Hotel staff seem to really love working there because everyone is so happy and friendly from valets to housekeeping, front desk and bar. Will definitely be back for other events, bar visits and of course another hotel get away. Kudos, Ace...this place rocks!!"}
{"text":"I went to the Ace Hotel for brunch! What a lovely experience. The food was amazing and so creative (bruleed grapefruit, lemon mousse with meringue and shortbread and blood orange mini donuts.....YUM !!) but the attention to detail with everything including the decor and the plating of the food was what wowed me! Of course none of this would matter if the service wasn't great....which it was! I hope that the quality of both the food and the service don't drop in the future! I'm definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"If there's another place I can play ping pong undisturbed in a giant gymnasium while sipping all the Tecate I ever wanted AND ALSO head inside the lobby bar for legitimate cocktails and board games in a comfortable lounge...I am not aware of it. 

I may not have stayed at the Ace, but somehow I still overstayed my welcome. Go figure."}
{"text":"Been to Ace in NYC and now have been to Ace Pittsburgh several times.
We're actually staying across the street at Hotel Indigo(very nice),but we've him over to Ace Hotel every day for coffee.We also did a family brunch for 6 yesterday.Coffee great.Fun atmosphere.Hipsters galore.
Only complaint is ADA access.Only wheelchair access is an outside mechanical lift-slow-cold-wet and a PITA."}
{"text":"Always delicious. Excellent duck spaetzle! Every entree I've ordered has been delicious. Impressive wine, cocktails and dessert. The atmosphere is nice, laid back with a mixed crowd."}
