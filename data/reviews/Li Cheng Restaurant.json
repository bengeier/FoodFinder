{"text":"Lots of vegetarian options. Good food at good prices and great daily specials on food and drinks."}
{"text":"We have been going to this place regularly for a couple of years now. The food is always fresh and tastes great. We usually just order take out and pick it up ourselves and sometimes eat in. The dinning room experience isn't the best the service is good just the place fills up with beer drinkers watching the game. 

Don't right off this place on the curb appeal. We did for many years and so glad that we have them a shot. This is our goto place for a great Chinese food. 

Favourite dishes:
Chicken Fried Rice
Chicken or Beef chop suey
#100 (I never remember the name of it) we order it not spicy. Thin noodles with chicken shrimp
Crispy Ginger Beef"}

{"text":"Absolute crap!!! Save your money!! The area is in need of a good Chinese restaurant until then I will hit Chinatown!! Too bad that Asian Star on Eglinton closed down."}
{"text":"You get a good amount of food for the price, but most of it is not as good as you would hope. When I ordered the combo plate for one chicken balls, I got two chicken balls with hardly any red sauce. I got too many vegetables and not enough rice. I was really disappointed. I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"The inside of this restaurant is bit of a bar type place with a pool table and a large tv with a bar table. 

Sat down on the regular table and ordered the special chicken chilly which is supposedly one of their more popular choices. The food came fast and tasted decently okay.. Not awesome but not bad either.. 

My biggest negative is the plates supplied had some permanent greenish color stuck on it.. Did not like that. Color wouldn't come off even if I rubbed it with the paper towel. 

Also the lady denied my coupon saying its only for take out even though the coupon doesn't say anything about it.

It seems like a nice place to come grab some drinks and bite to eat... Maybe will do take out next time."}
{"text":"Located on Marlee, the outside isn't the greatest. Looks very bar-like and tacky. The inside is alright. I've never seen a Chinese restaurant with a pool table inside lol, but whatever they're doing, they're doing it right. We order food to go from here. We got fish & tofu, chicken and broccoli, and rice. They gave us complimentary fried chicken which were delicious and piping hot. All items were surprisingly good - guess you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover :P The items did take quite a long time for them to prepare. Would definitely order here again."}
{"text":"This place has been up the street from me forever and I finally ordered from them. I wanted to wait until I had ordered several different dishes before I made my review.

The food is good. I love the sauces they use, for example the broccoli in garlic sauce. I found some of the spicy dishes hit and miss for me but for anyone who likes mild-to-medium spice, they would be perfect. I wish they explained their noodles selection a little clearer on their menu; I'm not familiar with traditional names and thought some dishes would have the thin noodles but they turned out to be the fat ones.

I do love that credit card orders are authorized over the phone. Most places ask for the number but still try to take an imprint at the door. When the delivery person comes, all I have to do is sign, slam the door and hope I don't bite my tongue while eating.

The delivery was extremely quick, around 30 min. He was really friendly and polite, which I don't always get with delivery guys so it was a nice change. I found it extremely cute that the girl who took my order also confirmed that even though my order was right under $20 before taxes, I would still get my free spring roll. She told me that if they forgot to put it in the bag, to call back and let them know. I also received a free calendar. I often wonder if making these calendars are extremely cheap as I know a lot of businesses that give them out.

For any chinese food cravings I may have where laziness is a factor, I will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"For the price, you can't beat this place. The staff are always very welcoming and hospitable. The food is always good and the beer is always cold. . 

This is a nice family run neighborhood hang out, where you can sit down, relax, watch the game and shoot the breeze with your friends."}
{"text":"LiCheng is my go to spot for take out chinese. The deep fried chicken wings are my favorite. A squeeze of lemon and boom best wings. The chicken and beef fried rice isn't the greatest but I definitely recommend the pan fried ho fan with beef. Perfectly saucy and quite tasty. The also have great soup. My fail proof is the hot and sour soup. Really anything you order from there you'll probably enjoy. The staff is quite friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"This restaurant is next to my home and open till late. So when I have some late dinners this is one of the choices. Soups here are good. Calamari is very different from what you would have had in the past but is good different.
I am not a fan of their appetizers as they are a bit sweet for me. Dumplings are alright"}
{"text":"I really liked this place, I went so late night and they were open.
The plates are big, came lot of food. And the tastes are so good.
But the best thing is the price, I think any other place can beat it, really, is so cheap.

The service is not that fast but they are kind and nice!

They have options to eat there in the restaurant or just to take out.

I recommend it!"}
{"text":"There isn't too much going on for this place. 

One and only Chinese restaurant in my neighborhood, so I had couple takeout. 
Their lunch special is cheap. I mean cheap! Starting at 3.99 and it shows Very small portion, barely fitting half of the container they put it in. Taste isn't that great either, I would prefer food court Chinese food over this place any day."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, Eglinton West was home to a plethora of Chinese restaurants, old and new. 

Dedicated old-school sinophiles had their choice of sweet-and-sour superstars at all price points. From House of Chan (really more of a steak joint, with prices to match), to China House, to Ken Fong (an exciting discovery, since it co-opted much of the late, lamented Lichee Garden's menu), to Tasty Chinese hard by the subway station. 

House of Chan moved East following expropriation for an LRT station. China House was torn down to build condos. Ken Fong is now a turnkey sushi joint and Tasty was taken over by a mostly empty philly cheesesteak shop. 

But if you walk just past the Allen, and a few blocks up Marlee avenue, Licheng remains. 

If you're like me, and love a good greasy spoon, Licheng is promising from the outside. A bold yellow-and-red sign welcomes visitors, promising the usual regional cuisines. A banner draped over the parking lot/patio promises cheap lunch specials, which have become less cheap over the past two years. 

I ignore the fact that most summer evenings, said patio is hogged by a rowdy, hard-drinking crowd. 

I also ignore the fact that during the day the space itself is clogged by lonely drinkers nursing small dishes of dried chow mein noodles alongside their Domestic Bottles. 

One hungry day i venture in for lunch. I order off the special menu-chili chicken, wonton soup and an egg roll. 

An old, bald, squinty man at the next table tells me how he's a functional alcoholic.

I learn a lot about functional alcoholism during this meal. From his description, I wonder it it's actually a thing. 

The soup arrives first. Like most of its kind, the broth tastes primarily of salt and soy and msg. It goes well with the tale of broken dreams unfolding beside me. Also with the few slivers of barbecue pork at the bottom of the bowl. 

The egg roll is crispy and greasy. It has ruplured just a bit, meaning some of the insides have gone rock-hard. 

The chicken is battered and coated in a decent, slightly sweet but mostly hot sauce. It would be great if the bird itself were just a bit more tender. The rice on which it is served would be great too, if it were just a bit warmer. 

Maybe a drink would help. 

I leave, and decide I'll order in next time. 

On the plus side, my wife is a much better dining companion. On the minus side, the food is that much worse. 

How and sour soup arrives hot but muddy in flavour. Moo Shu and General Tao chicken are undone by more rubbery chicken-dark meat only-I don't know if it's so lousy because of over-or-under cooking...I'm in no hurry to conduct further investigations. Or to go back. 

I opt for that drink, to wash it down before the leftovers (plenty of those) get binned. 

Eglinton West is a neighbourhood in transition. I only hope a new Chinese place transitions there permanently. 

In the meantime, anybody know what the Tasty guys are up to?"}
{"text":"Just purchased food from here for my two children, and our family, and as my daughter was half way through her food found a steel piece on her plate!!!! Our money was returned, but first and last time. Also, as we were coming out of the restaurant another customer was complaining about soap in her food!!!"}
