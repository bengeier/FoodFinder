{"text":"Been here a few times with friends and fam from out of town honestly I have always been very happy with the experience.  Yes its expensive but food is good maybe not 5 star good but the views and overall experience is the best.  Sucks obviously on a foggy day but when skies are clear you will see whole city and amazing views, good drink and food."}
{"text":"After all the hype - just ok. View was FANTASTIC and the revolving part was really great. We dined about an hour before sunset so we saw the city in the day, dusk, and after dark, all lit up. Service wasn't very good - I think it was kind of busy, but that's not really an excuse. It seemed like they wanted it to be a very fancy dining experience (prices, decor) but it came off as pretty touristy. There were lots of families there with loud children and people wearing jeans. For ~$100/person I would have expected better service, food, and atmosphere. The food was alright - ate from the pre fixe menu and it was normal 'fancy food' salmon, small salads, chocolate cakes, etc. The worst part was that near our side of the restaurant, we happened to have a great view as the sun was disappearing, so lots of other people crowded around our table to take pictures of the sunset against the glass - rude. Good for the view, but maybe just go up there to have drinks? Much better view that the observation deck (which we stopped at on the way down) TERRIBLE view..it was all fenced in for safety I assume, but it made for an awful view."}
{"text":"Awesome view- make sure you go when you can watch the sunset.  We had steak and lobster and it was delicious.  The lobster tail was larger than most and the steak was perfectly prepared.  This restaurant gets mediocre reviews which I don't understand.  It is expensive but you are paying for the view along with the food and the food is really quite good."}
{"text":"Great place to take your second half for a date, birthday or anniversary! Good thing, you do not have to wait in line to get to the restaurant. Separate elevator takes diners to the top floor!
Views are gorgeous, ambiance is quite nice! Service is ordinary! Food was alright,  slightly overpriced but we know why, we are at one the most visited places in Canada.
All in all, very pleasant experience! My wife was very happy and this is a key!"}
{"text":"Been here on several occasions for fun. We usually choose the set price menu. Vegetarian options are great. They change throughout the season. It's pretty classy in terms of a fine dining experience. Clean, impeccable service, and delicious."}
{"text":"I like it, I'm usually a harsh critique to food, but come on guys! this place's seafood was amazing, I had the sea food platter, the lobster was so sweet and delicious and fresh! 

the soup was great too! 

This is definitely the better CN Tower rotating restaurant between this location and Niagara location. 

I highly recommend it if you are looking for a classy date place. 

the only down was that large groups are way too loud, if you were seated around them, you are shit out of luck. like me. unfortunately. but the atmosphere was still amazing once i mastered to block their sounds and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband for his 30th birthday, and unfortunately it did not meet our expectations at all. First off, I had made reservations in advance but we were seated right beside a table of four even though the restaurant was basically empty (it was a cold Monday night). Although our waiter was attentive, he spent the entire time chatting nearby with another waiter when he wasn't serving us--it was pretty distracting. He also gave an unsolicited explanation as to what an amuse bouche was when we ordered, which makes me think he had erroneously assumed that we had never eaten at a fancy restaurant before. 

My main complaint however is that the food was nothing special, and our main dish arrived lukewarm. The chilli tuna was prettily presented but flavorless, and my husband remarked that our prime rib and fish tasted like reheated gourmet airplane food. The smoked salmon was good, but I got sick about an hour after leaving the restaurant. We expected MUCH better for the price we paid. I am aware that part of the pricing has to do with the rotating view and atmosphere, but in all honesty it isn't worth it. We've been to the rotating restaurant in Ottawa which has equally stunning views, lower prices and substantially better food.

I am normally happy to try anything once, but in hindsight I would much rather have gone to the CNTower to enjoy the view, but pass on this tourist trap."}
{"text":"Had a great day here ..came for birthday lunch with my girlfriend. .had a great time.. i had the prime rib perfectly cooked at medium. .she had ziti wild mushroom dish also great...their appetizers wild salmon and three ducks were so good.
They also brought me a dessert for free because of my birthday i guess...
Will definitely be back great food and service plus relaxing atmosphere with an amazing view go early with you want a window seat.
Thank you again 360 resturant."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to go here since I first moved to Toronto back in 1989. It wasn't at all what I expected, it's more touristy then \"fine dining and romantic\", though when I think about it, makes perfect sense. 
My friend and I shared one of the seafood towers, but I would like to go back and try something else from the menu. The decor needs some freshening up, seemed very outdated. Service was good. Great wine list. I would go back, especially if I had company from out of town because that view from any angle cannot be beat. We went up while it was still light and the watched the sunset, stunning. 
I'd give it 3.5 stars, but I don't get that option here."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for brunch, and it was great. Food wise, it wasn't top notch (though we came here for brunch not dinner) because not everything that we ordered was worth recommending/reordering. Some plates were really good and tasty, and others were just average. At the restaurant, you end up paying more for your food because of the view that you get. If you're new to the area or are travelling, it's worth coming here for lunch/dinner so that you get a great view of the city. It's cheaper than buying the ticket separately just for the observatory; enjoy a meal and visit the deck below on your way down. Then you get your bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars for the view and the experience of the tower...
But I really did not like the service of this place. I felt rushed and server even picked up the signed copy of the check while we were at the table. I thought that was really rude."}
{"text":"Definitely not a place I would go to again.  My girlfriend and I were visiting from Boston and wanted a special Toronto experience; naturally one of the first things that came to mind was dinner at 360.  To summarize: the food was below average, the prices were outrageous, and the service was sub-par.  Obviously people go for the experience, not the dining, but they should still put some effort into their food and hiring exceptional waitstaff."}
{"text":"I would strongly recommend this to anyone visiting Toronto! The views are awesome. The day we visited was nice and clear and at 115 story's up, wow! The food was also very well prepared and the service was excellent. All of the staff was on the ball.

After lunch we went down 1 (or 2?) floor(s) to the observation deck and took some great pictures.  There is also a glass floor you can stand on and see all the way down to the ground below!
Well worth it."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the view was amazing and the service was amazing. I had the lamb sausage, then a steak and finally a chocolate lava cake. Everything was amazing and we'll cooked, it took less than 5 mins to bring out the appetizer, and less than one minute between meals, it was like when one person took are plates away there was someone else already coming with the next cource, the view speaks for its self, and the whole restaurant rotates so you can see every angle of the city of Toronto. I would completely recommend going if you are in the area but it is a little pricey, it cost $300 for the 3 of us but other than that it is by far the best restaurant that I have ever been too."}
{"text":"We had lunch here on a Sunday afternoon.  I had heard mixed reviews about 360 but we wanted to come to the CN Tower anyway so we decided to try the place out.  It was amazing.  We ordered the Seafood Tower which was totally fresh, flavorful and worth every penny.  If I could remember the name of our server I would give him a shout out too. I know he had worked there many many years... He was so friendly and kind and the service matched the food. Out of this world.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great meal. Might seem expensive but if you were going to the top of the CN tower to start with, it's a fair price. Kids had a great time."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5
Service: 4/5
Atmosphere: 5/5

Let me say this first: when planning a visit to Toronto, a trip to the top of the CN Tower is a must-do item for everyone.  Now, just the trip up the elevators is $35 per adult, so why not enjoy some food while up top too?  For the cost of a main dish (~$40), you get admission to the tower and an unforgettable meal!"}
{"text":"One word that describes this place perfectly... EXPENSIVE. But one thing I can approve of is that their food has upgraded itself from a 'wtf is this?!?!' up to a 'meeh, its alright' My past dinner experience here scarred me for life with their HORRIBLE food and I was planning to never return here again but having family come over from Asia, they wanted to visit the famous Canadian landmark - so really, I had no choice.
I'm assuming the reason why it's so expensive here is because you're really paying for the scenic view and the experience of dining \"at the top of the world\". 
But to my surprise, when I arrived at the restaurant, my tourist personality came out and I was 'oohhhing and ahhinng' at the view. I even went out to the extent of taking pictures with our window (so sad, but true). I won't deny it, the view is spectacular! 
Anyways moving on to the food I found out that it wasn't as bad as I remembered it to be. I had ordered the Ontario Lamb with Rosemary Juice along with a side of asparagus w/ mozzarella cheese and a dish of sweet potato frites .The food overall tasted pretty good and was nicely presented. The only con was that their portions were quite small for the prices you're paying. ALSO, the waiter that was serving us gave me quite a disappointment. He seemed to be very.... cold towards us. At one point I wanted to say to him 'why so serious, dude?' He never smiled at us and he seemed to have selective service towards potential big tippers. I give you 3 stars for the surprisingly good food, the amazing atmosphere, the overly expensive meal and the suckish wait staff."}
{"text":"The restaurant sucks but the view is worth it if you go for lunch and know not to expect too much. Because if you pay for an entree you dont pay to get to the observatory floor. Otherwise, steer clear. 

The service sucks, they really dont care too much here... I didn't eat my first course because it was gross. I gave it a try but it was disgusting me. It reminded me of what you drink before a colonoscopy. Plus it was cold soup--and I guess I dont think it's appropriate in October.

The waiter noticed I didn't eat. \"You didnt like?\" I said no and he shrugged, like \"whatever\", and took away the soup. You don't offer a salad instead? My soda was empty. Didnt care. 

The chicken and green beans were decent but the potatoes were wayyyyy oversalted, although edible--as long as you're not hypertensive. 

Desert was good, but waiter never refilled coffee. Because he didn't care. 

Bascially the service sucks and the food is meh. It's what I like to call fake fancy...tricking tourists into believing they are eating at a classy four star restaurant is fake fancy."}
{"text":"With the in-laws in town, we chose the 360 as our first night dinner. With my last dinner here over 20 years ago, I can say that the 360 has upped its game. Although I miss the nostalgic branded take home goblet glasses, I did enjoy the classier approach to dining. Entrance to the tower is quick if you have reservations and from the get-go, it's all a very organized affair. We were seated at a comfortable booth by the window with a perfect view of the city below. Our server was for the most part reliable aside from his hesitancy to answer questions about gluten free options. We all chose the $75 prix-fixe option with my choices being; Red Beet Borsch, Duck Confit Salad, Lobster & Shrimp Ragout, and Roasted Lemon Curd Mousse for dessert. Everything was well prepared and delicious. The Lemon Mousse was a tad too tart but I'm okay with that. Having taken our group pic against a green screen on our way in, we received the final picture towards the end of dinner. A beautiful evening finished with free admission to the observation deck and glass floor."}
{"text":"5 stars for the experience, 3 for the food and service. This was my second time being here, the first being 3 years ago.

1) Environment - Honestly, you really can't beat eating a meal 1500+ feet in the air with a view of the city, how could you? I booked reservations for 2 online (easy to do), got tickets to go up once our bookings were confirmed and after a short wait in the elevator line, we were at the restaurant. The view is absolutely breathtaking. It was a bit of a cloudy day when we went but still was amazing to see Toronto. The restaurant rotates quite slowly, but be careful not to leave things on the floor (almost got my umbrella crushed between the floor and one of the pillars as it turned!). With your reservation, not only is the trip up covered but you can also walk down to the glass floor, go out onto the observatory deck, and basically get the full tourist experience. 

2) Food - it is very pricey for the quality and taste. The meal was a shade under $200 for the pair of us, which is to be expected for what it is (two 2 course meals with wine/cocktails). The portions were on the smaller side (again to be expected) but the taste was quite ordinary. I had the salmon which was flavourful on the outside but somewhat bland-ish after that. The caesar I had was average to below-average, with poor garnishing in my opinion.

3) Service - it was OKAY, nothing great. The servers looked quite disinterested to be frank. There was a bit of a comical exchange between myself and a server who thought I had certain dietary restrictions based on religious assumptions, but I thought this was out of good intent and not malicious or stereotyping. It was difficult to get their attention at times because there is usually only one server (maybe 2) for a section of the restaurant (or it appeared that way at least). 

All in all, I think it is worth going once for the experience. There is a vegetarian menu as well for those who have dietary restrictions. The food is average, but the view is unparalleled."}
{"text":"The view was amazing, the service was good, the food was not so good and was not worth the price. The experience of the view and having some drinks from up there was worth it. But the food was just OK. We didn't have any reservation, but we could still go there without a line up or anything and it was just close to Christmas, so I thought it would have been more crowded, but it was not."}
{"text":"As others have said, the views are great and it is a treat to have access to the lower levels after your meal. However, they seem to have stacked the admission fee to the tower on top of what should be charged for the meal. I had the prime rib, which was really tasty but I've had the exact same quality of food at other restaurants where the price is $20-$30 less expensive for the same meal. Service was good, and the ambience was alright. I'm happy to have gone for the novelty but would go elsewhere for a good steak and more romantic atmosphere for the cost ($65 for dinner and an appetizer)."}
{"text":"The view of course was amazing. As long as you are on the outer ring of tables, there is no such thing as a bad seat since you will make one full rotation every 72 minutes. The elevator ride on the way up was fantastic as well. Its all glass so you can look out at the city on your way up, and also there is glass in the floor. The only problem for me was after the elevator ride and then sitting at a table while everything was moving, I started to feel a little dizzy. Food was expensive as expected, but was still pretty good. You do not go to a place like this for the food, you go there for the experience and to say that you ate there. Am I glad I went? Yes. Would I go a second time? Probably not."}
{"text":"Obviously you go there for the view ... and the view is great.
You also go there for the food and it's Okay. Not \"wahou\" but not a robbery neither. Quality and quantities are there; not a lot of creativity ; a little overcooked for the meat. Good service.
 A nice place to go for the experience and goo moment."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto, we decided to have lunch at 360 before checking out the glass floor, etc.
Menu was small but had a little something for everyone.  Of course we went with the prixe fixe menu since it was a little more than just an entree would cost.
I had the Summer tomato salad (which was excellent) and the salmon with fried capers (which was decent).
I loved the view as we ate and rotated around.  I liked the set up of the restaurant, which had most tables by the window so you could enjoy the view.
Service was ok-nothing stellar. 

I would recommend to anyone visiting Toronto with the CN Tower on their list to visit."}
{"text":"Just finished a great night here. Yes one could say it is a tourist trap however you will never get a million dollar view like the one you get here. The food quality is excellent and yes very expensive but what do you expect your not paying a entrance fee as it's included in your meal price. 

My daughter loved we came for her birthday upon arrival they greeet with and area where you can take a pic as a momento. I got suckered into buying it. 

I had the Cesar salad and for my meal the salmon. For dessert I had maple syrup 3 ways... If your coming here get that dessert it is amazing. 

Broke the bank but well worth and happy that this restaurant is ours to enjoy in Toronto."}
{"text":"A truly wonderful dining experience. We had the prix fixe menu options. I had the roasted pumpkin and garlic bisque with duck confit and dried cranberries, the arctic char with hubbard squash, hazelnuts, and wild rice, and the Canadian cheese plate. My meal was paired with a lovely Canadian 2014 Pinot Gris. My daughter had the kids' prix fixe salmon option which came with asparagus (which she loves) and french fries (I do wish mashed potatoes had been offered as with the child's prime rib). Her dessert was a creme caramel with two little buttery cookies.
Our waiter was very attentive. He immediately offered my daughter a Shirley Temple and made sure that she left with a handful of candy.
The view is spectacular of course. Do be sure to arrive 15-20 minutes before your reservation to process through security and take the elevator. We were delayed waiting for the elevator as there was also a private party that night, but our hostess seated us in a different section so that we'd get to see the entire rotation.
It was quite loud so an intimate conversation might not be possible. Expect constant photo flashes. There was a birthday party and a proposal that night, as well."}
{"text":"The food here is terrible. I would honestly rather eat fast food than the food they have here. I don't mind paying a lot for good food, but this place is clearly a rip off when you compare prices to quality of food. A place like The Keg for example is worth the price, this place is not."}
{"text":"What a missed opportunity! A spectacular view with spectacularly bad 'food'. We were four people and every single main dish went back to the kitchen half eaten and we had all come in with hearty appetites. 
The prices are way out of line but that would be tolerable if the food was of good quality and handled with some artistry. A frittata could be a simple, delicious dish but the one served at 360 was an amateurish unpleasant tasting mess. And why in the world is a major tourist attraction in the province not serving and highlighting the fantastic local Ontario produce? Oh well, just another opportunity wasted."}
{"text":"a bit costly, but a full 360 degree view of toronto from this rotating restaurant.  solid service and  nice meal.  its all about the view."}
{"text":"Nous avons pris le forfait menu fixe; ce qui inclu la visite du belvédère et le plancher de verre
Nous avons énormément apprécié notre souper du mercredi soir d'été..
Bien accueuilli  ( on avait réservé trois jours davance)
Le service avec Mr Carlos était chaleureux et il nous a bien conseillé...
Notre souper était succulent: magret de canard, le saumon et les pâtes aux fruits de mer...sans parler des entrées!!
Et du dessert au chocolat
La vue était imprenable par un temps si ensoleillé
Les vins sont un peu cher; les moins dispendieux débutent à 44$ mais le choix est énorme...
Vraiment formidable et agréable à faire!

Août 2015"}
{"text":"This place was all about the view, once you have seen it once, that's enough.  I'd rather look into my husbands eyes.  4/5 service (5 if didn't have to ask to order our mains as waiting so long). Ordered slow roasted Canadian beef sirloin and barely warm big fat and fatty slab meat slopped on top of perfectly cooked vegetables.  The waiter said they couldn't substitute any aspects of my dessert-very inflexible and dessert very disappointing.  Lucky my awesome husband made up for an average and overpriced meal"}
{"text":"The view was FANTASTIC.  I ordered a mixed seafood platter, and my crab claws were spoiled.  BEST oysters I've ever had.  A bit overpriced, but remember you save $20 from the obs. deck.  My husband and I spent $140 on lunch, a bit pricy, but you only live once.  I will definitely do it again, but skip the seafood platter."}
{"text":"Not to be missed! Great food at a bargain price (3 courses menu of really fine cuisine) for 65 CAD which is only twice the price of a single admission ticket (30 CAD) to the panoramic terrace. Very good service and an unique experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic view!!!!! The 2 tier seafood is not good at all, and it's not enough for 2 people as main dish. We changed our order from 3 tiers plate was because the server told us 2 tiers is actually enough for 2 to 3 people in despite of the menu said 3 tiers for 2 people as main dish. The mussels are the smallest I had seen ever. The servers had very bad photography skill, which is a big pity n waste for customers capture the best moment under that amazing view. I had to ask different servers to take photos for me n my bf, and my bf was pissed off for the suffering of my bothering instead of eating. Still none of the photos was good. I was so disappointed since we had been looking forward to this special meal. The servers were too busy to serve our need. That's why we didn't order dessert since no one came to us for a long time."}
{"text":"Delicious food in a perfect place!

Before I went here, I didn't really know what to think. Since CN Tower is the #1 tourist attraction, I thought their food would be good, but maybe not that special. However, it was very special (in a good way). They have a fixed price 3 dish lunch/dinner with a lot to choose from (one extra combination alternative between Dec 1-24). You can also order from their À la carte. All the food we ordered was fancier than the little more expensive restaurants in the city and it tasted much better as well. It was actually the best food I have had in Toronto, after being here for 4 months.

It rotates in a perfect pace while you're eating (takes about 72 minutes to go 360 degrees).

And another great thing - if you have made a reservation you don't need to buy a ticket to the Tower (it's free to go up to the restaurant and also to the lower level after you're done). (Because of this, you'll get the food for more or less half price)."}
{"text":"The view was spectacular! The food was pretty good too! Caesar salad had a garlic aioli dressing instead of Caesar dressing... Kinda weird! I'm giving it a 4 star because there were so many waiters coming to the table and they forgot some drinks and we had to remind them about the drinks. Also, the raspberry sorbet was VERY sweet. Te strawberry ice cream however was very good!"}
{"text":"Dinner at the 360 restaurant in the CN tower is truly a one of a kind experience in which no other restaurant will ever compare. I went to Toronto to celebrate my 27th birthday and made reservations with high expectations and this restaurant definitely set the bar high...1,151 feet high to be exact. Upon entering the elevator, I felt the adrenaline all over my body as the elevator shot up 5.1 mph to the top while the view of the city enhanced with every foot higher. The restaurant itself has a nice mellow vibe and everyone was welcoming and attentive. The lights were perfectly dim while we watched the rotating view of the sunset from all angles. Yes, the restaurant rotates! The food was amazing! We chose to do the prix fixed menu which was perfect and totally worth the price plus it came with access to the observation floor and glass floor. We each an had appetizer, main course and shared a bottle of wine which we selected from their 500+ list of located in their \"cellar in the sky\". Our waiter Shan was extremely polite and attentive; a true gentleman. We were dying to take pictures with the view and he accommodated us by moving chairs and tables aside so we can capture our perfect picture. My friend asked if there were any treats for birthdays and he said that there usually weren't but that he would see what he can do and minutes later came out with a little cake with a candle on it. In conclusion, (lol) anyone who visits Toronto should definitely make dinner reservations at the CN tower...it's an experience like no other."}
{"text":"There is such a nice view you should not missed it! Even the food is not good, but still worth?seafood always the best choice. Do try the AAA steak :p there also offer fresh oyster, it is so good... But we did not try. Coz for dinner each person have to Oder a entree to get free visiting tiket."}
{"text":"We recently decided to check out the tower while in town and decided to go up to the 360 Restaurant for lunch while we were there. I would highly recommend doing so if you go during the day time.

I'm a little surprised as some of the negative reviews on here. I would agree that it is a bit pricey, but at least the menu has several options and you get to go to the observation deck included with your meal.  The staff were very friendly and willing to take group pictures.  Perhaps some of the food is so-so as some of the other reviews state, but our food was actually very good.

One thing I am very surprised about are the negative reviews about the service; our service was actually top notch and rivaled that of some 4-5 star restaurants I've dined at.  Perhaps I got lucky and got a great server, or others weren't so lucky and didn't, but our experience was great overall.

Not something I'd do every day, but I'd certainly recommend checking it out once."}
{"text":"Amazing views of Toronto from up here. The food is just ok, nothing extraordinary. I had one of the Prix Fixe choices and it turned out to be decent meal.
The service is good and the decoration of the restaurant is very nice.
Would recommend to anyone visiting Toronto.  The view while dining is just fantastic."}
{"text":"The food is too small and the price was high. Never go when hungry. The only things was good is the view and experience.  I recommend people to pay 25$ to CN TOWER entrance and go to the observation floor instead."}
{"text":"one of the best views of toronto and great locally sourced seafood makes this a win."}
{"text":"I got the salmon for main dish, it was over cooked and too salty for my liking. However my friend got the pork and it was tender and juicy (great pick) 
For dessert I got the apple crumble- it was good 
My friend got the tower - it wasnt so good
Over all, for the price food was okay..mainly for the experience and the beautiful view."}
{"text":"Read some of the other reviews and I have to disagree.  This was one of the best experiences I've had in a long time.  The views are incredible and the prices are reasonable.  If you go to visit the lookout tower, it cost $23 while a 3 course price fix menu cost $55.  WELL WORTH IT.  I had salmon, heirloom tomatoes and a great dessert.  Its something everyone should try while in Toronto."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the view and the experience, I would have walked away from the place waaaay before the food came. I wasn't given choice for seating (I didn't get the seat near the window) and I had to look out to the view with a few heads covering my view. It was a bit crowded, the menu lacked choice, and the food wasn't all that great. Also everything was overpriced. From the food to the photograph."}
{"text":"The view is really nice from the CN tower and we wanted to eat and enjoy the view. When you read the menu you really think your going to enjoy tasty and enjoyable food. I took the ribs sandwhich and my girlfriend the perogies. Both of the dishes were not tasting much and greasy. It was not disgusting at all but when looking at the price and the menu description you get disappointed. Service was really good and the selection of beers and drinks are interesting. I would hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"CN Tower is worth going. Hope you enjoy the dishes there. May I post the recipe for you? Haha."}
{"text":"Went here for my anniversary.  You pay for the view and the view alone.  Don't eat the main dishes.

High security to get inside.

NEED a reservation.  I made a reservation but they tried to stick me in the back row... why would I come up for the view and then view people's heads.  Maybe specify you are looking for a window seat when you reserve.

You have to order a main course or else you pay the $10 each to get up there... and also if you want to go to the top top then its an additional $10.  I wish i just got the appy and paid the $20 for us to get up there.

The food is not good.  We had an appy of salmon, which was quite good.  The flavour and the sauce was great.

For the main course.. it was bad. My man ordered the lamb and he got 3 tiny pieces of lamb... of which about HALF was just fat.  Almost a $60 main course of a very small cut of lamb you would assume it would at least be lean.  He also said \"it was just cooked... not marinated.. not sautéed with anything... only cooked and cooked alone.  No flavour.\"  I had the hen... which was also lacking flavour.  It was enough meat on the plate for this dish but also very very plain.  About as much flavour as just taking a plain piece of chicken and putting it in the oven with nothing else.

All together the Salmon appitzer, the main (plain jane) hen dish, and the main (fatty and unflavoured) lamb, no drinks, came to $130."}
{"text":"The main reason why someone would go to a restaurant without parking, to be packed in a line up, go through security, pay a hefty price for a meal that isn't that great with poor customer service is to watch a spectacular sunset! 
Being with my fabulous company made this experience ever so enjoyable. It is my second time at the CN tower. First time I went with cousins as a kid. I didn't remember much about the food but do remember it isn't worth going at night as it's badly lite so for the second and probably last time I visit, I wasn't able to take good pictures. 
Our waiter was an older asian man who was quite rude, careless and didn't know anything about the menu. He never came once to give us a refill; my boyfriend's son had to get up and ask for water! One would  expect impeccable service and excellent food when spending nearly $200 but not at 360; it's just a tourist attraction and anyone who wants fantastic food shouldn't bother. 
If you want to try something different like a restaurant that spins up in the sky, this is a neat place to go but forget about luxury at all levels as it only tries to imitate it."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying went here the weekend of Canada day and boy was this packed.  As my reservation stated walked into CN tower and walked right up to the 1st desk of 360 restaurant then was told to walk all the left side up to the security point.  As I walked past all the people on the right line I thought to myself 'thank god I have a reservation to the restaurant there is no way in hell I would have waited that line just to go to the top of the tower.  

We passed security then went to the 2nd desk and then we were escorted to take a picture and finally to take the elevator up to the restaurant.  Once we arrived we were 15 minutes early but were still seated right away.  Our waiter was super kind and patient since I had to translate all the items on the menu to the in laws lol its ok though.

The bread they bring you is fresh and tasty.  For appetizer we ordered the summer tomato salad which was good,small but we all four shared.  As entrees we ordered three striploin steaks and te lamb rack chops.  The steaks were cooked just how we ordered.  The hubby loved the lamb rack chops.  The side dishes they give you are huge we ordered baked potato(which brings two huge potatoes),an order of asparagus and an order of roasted rapini and we ate from each side dish.

Overall great view and experience,plus you get to skip the lines.  Pricey but worth it.  Oh yeah if you decide to go up to the observation deck once you are done eating, do not be silly and wait in line to take the elavator back down.  Just walk back down to the restaurant and tell them you ate there and they will take you down NO NEED TO WAIT IN Line YAY"}
{"text":"We went during the summer and made an evening reservation and got  the highest \"prix fixe\" menu option, which I believe is around $70 dollar per person. The food was average, considering the place, I expected better. Looking at other tables that went \"a la carte\", their food seemed better. however, our choice gave us access to the \"look out\" and \"Glass Floor\" levels; which we enjoyed after our dinner. I would go \"a la carte\" next time. To be honest, the view is worth it, I enjoyed that more than the food...not saying that the food was horrible, it just fell short of my expectations. If you don't care about accessing the look out or glass floor levels, you can get away with sitting down at a table and ordering inexpensive items, just to experience the 360 moving view....Amazing! Overall, the 360 Restaurant and Tower are worth your time!"}
{"text":"I give this 4 stars because first I have two kids. I can skip the line and go straight to the top of the tower ( even two floors above the observation deck). This on its own deserves 4-stars. We went for a 11:30 am lunch. My kids were so surprised by the view. The food was good. Both my husband and I ordered the prefix 2- course meal  for $59 and My kids also ordered the prefix meal that includes a drink, main course and dessert for $40. I had the duck 3-ways but portion was a bit small. Main course I had the cod which was okay. I wish the temperature of my food was a bit hotter. Service was good and professional. The best part was that after dinner we could walk down the staircase for the observation deck and glass floor. We then walked back to the restaurant and took the elevator down ( again time saving and skipping"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to the CN Tower's 360 Restaurant for a long needed night out.  We had made a reservation prior to our arrival.  It was both of our first time at this restaurant and the process of getting up to the restaurant seemed daunting.  Luckily the staff at the CN Tower is helpful and kind and led us through the security check and to the main elevators.

Once we got to the top, we checked in at the host desk.  They told us that the wait will be about 15 minutes.  This would be annoying since we had a reservation, but it worked perfectly because we were invited to walk around the Observation deck.  Access to the deck is provided with your meal.

After walking around and admiring the Torontonian views, we returned to the host who lead us to our table.  The most unique feature of the 360 Restaurant is its spinning dining area.  Walking to our table, the rotating view was definitely unique.  Some windows are marked with little stickers which remind you of which direction you're actually facing.

We decided on the fixed price menu, $55 per person.  The meal began with bread and butter.  To our surprise, the bread was cold, we were slightly let down by the disappointing bread in this otherwise, fancy restaurant.  The rest of the meal was very good, from the ceasar salad, to the chicken breast.  Dessert was especially good. An exquisite chocolate mousse adorned with berries was a great ending to the fantastic meal.

Our waiter was polite enough to take a picture of the two of us with our camera and offered a keepsake photo of our visit which was taken by the entrance in front of a green screen.

Our visit to the 360 Restaurant in the CN Tower was a memorably good experience in a Torontonian restaurant.  This is sure to be a restaurant saved for special occasions and romantic dinners."}
{"text":"I wouldn't bring my friend to the 360 restaurant at CN tower again. The food was definitely overpriced, and wasn't tasty at all. I ordered steak, and ate a bite of it. The view was okay, but not as fantastic as I thought it to be. The food was horrible. That's all I can say."}
{"text":"We brought some guests here for the prix fixe lunch and to enjoy the view from the CN tower minus the crowd downstairs.

The food and service isn't particularly outstanding as I thought it would be, the price really just goes into for the comfort of having a nice place to see the views without having your hair blown around in all. The portions didn't look very big, but surprisingly I was full at the end of the meal.

The dark chocolate tower came out to be like the leaning tower of Pisa... it didn't taste bad, but I would think that for this price they would pay attention to this sort of detail."}
{"text":"I went to that restaurant with my friend, coming from France. 
I made a reservation for 9:45 pm, which is pretty late if you want to take the best advantage of the view, by seeing the lake and the city during the sunset...

Some friends recommended me to take the seafood platter for 45$ : any deception, it was delicious ! 
We stayed for 1h30 which is actually the time to make a complete 360° turn (yes, the restaurant is rotating).

The service was ok, we hadn't wait too long. This restaurant is very classy and stylish. I didn't see any kids...only couples around 30 -40 yo. 

Pieces of friendly advice : make the reservation a long time before, take the seafood platter if you like it, and go there to admire the sunset !"}
{"text":"You will get a good view of Toronto from 360 but not the best food. The risotto  was the worst...

There are so many great restaurants around the area, so I recommend that all one should do at the CN tower is to look and leave!"}
{"text":"4 out of 5! great place to go with tourists! Spectacular view and food is very tasty! I recommend the steak or lamb! $$$$"}
{"text":"I stopped into 360 while visiting the CN Tower and took a chance because the menu looked great. But for a restaurant in one of Toronto and Canada's top attractions, this place needs a lot of work. To start with, the water is really bad - affects the ice and soda too. The menu looks and reads great, but the food itself is just above average. I ordered the steak frites which came beautifully presented. The steak wasn't cooked how I ordered it, but aside from that it was bland and oily from the bed of peppers. The fries themselves were cooked in old oil and so tasted bad. But the service was fairly bad too - waiter wasn't busy (restaurant was empty) but spent most of his time watching TV - made no attempt to seat me when I entered and was just not really interested in being there. 

Pricing is quite good but to be honest, I'm sure there are better places to eat. This is technically a state-run restaurant but it's sub-par. I've read some good reviews it had in the past, so I think it's just become a victim of the economy. It's a real shame however as it has high footfall from the CN Tower visitors, but falls down on quality and service. 

But you actually can't believe the views. Best thing about this place. The rest is just average."}
{"text":"Great Sea food. 

And what can a say about the view is the best. Go for a dinner and see the sun come down it is gorgeous!"}
{"text":"Do not eat here, no matter what you may hear!  Food was extremely over priced,  was mediocre at best and service was horrible!  It's absolutely a tourist focused place, which was very disappointing. The view was spectacular but even that couldn't make up for everything else that wasn't good. 
Do your research and find someplace, any place else to eat!"}
{"text":"Subsequently spoke with another manager who professionally and kindly resolved the issue. We took her invitation to return....

...and we did. 

A+. The level of professional service from Javed and Nazmul was subtle and sublime. All courses, especially the corn and tomato gazpacho, duck confit and cod three ways were perfectly prepared.

Needless to say, the 360 views on a crystal clear day were spectacular!"}
{"text":"The location is worth this very expensive visit! We had the 4 course menu, and it all tasted fine, But it wasnt fantastic. The service was good and the wine selection exellent! The floor is rotating so you will See all of Toronto from the Best view. A great experience. Except they placed to women next to us, that wanted our Windowseat and the waitress told Them \"30 minutes\" and we just had our appetizer. That was kind of stressful and annoying. I send back my steak because it was impossible to chew and got a new perfect fantastic steak. To go to the view point two levels down afterwards was disappointing, it was fenced up, so you couldnt really See anything or take pictures . I wouldnt go there for that, But go for the restaurant experience- thats great."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! Service was unbelievable, and I would definitely go back again.  It was very expensive, but you pay for what you get.  Beautiful view and service was great! Would recommend both tourists and locals to go here!"}
{"text":"The portion sizes are EXTREMELY small for how much you pay. i bought the 2 course meal and i was shocked when they brought out my meal. So so small, and so are desserts. The menu doesn't have much variety, mostly fish. The 360 rotator overall is cool, the view is incredible, and the servers are very kind. I would go back"}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate my birthday and WOW, the view is amazing and the food was pretty good. 

Service was great and going up the tower was a breeze. You get to bypass the lineups to eat at 360. The whole restaurant turns, like a rotating disc which is really cool. There is an overwhelming selection of wine!!! You have your choice of going with the prefix menu or just the dishes, I chose the 2 course prefix menu ($65). You get a variety of dishes to pick from which I got the trout clam chowder and pork tenderloin. The chowder was creamy and the pork tenderloin was so juicy and tender. Only con was that the food was a bit on the cold side. I also got dessert which was a warm cranberry pecan tart  and my golly the tart was hard as rock. Really hard to cut into.  

Overall, I had a good time and would recommend this restaurant for anyone who wants a unique experience.

Bonus - there is also a complimentary entrance to the lookout deck that you can check out after your meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for the lunch hour and we knew not to get our hopes up based on some of the reviews here. The service was pretty standard considering it was difficult to get a hold of our server. The view was absolutely terrific and worth it, and I was surprisingly impressed by the food. But for the perpetual fishy smell in the air and water and the barely okay service, I give it three stars."}
{"text":"My wife and I made a trip to Toronto for our anniversary. I chose to surprise her with dinner at 360 restaurant.

Let me preface this by saying that I planned this more for the experience than excellent food. I assumed it would be a bit of a tourist trap and I was right but that was not a big deal.

The views were awesome! Service was good. But the food.. Quite disappointing.. 

I had the $75 prix fixe. First course was a red beer borscht. It was ok..

Next was a fresh fish and seafood chowder. It was very bland... Seems like someone forgot to season it. Also the clams were gritty and not cleaned properly..

Main course was black trumpet mushroom crusted halibut and prawn ravioli. The carrot and ginger jus were a terrible match for the fish. The halibut was again bland, as was the ravioli. The ravioli was quite doughy. Main course was terrible.

The dessert I had was dark chocolate 3 ways.. I found they really hid the flavour of the dark chocolate.. And with a wilted mint leaf, it made it look sad..

The only reason I gave three stars was because of the overall experience with the views. If this had been a regular restaurant with this caliber of food, it would have been hard to even give a 2."}
{"text":"5 stars for the 360 view but their food just did not live up to expectations. Got the New York steak medium rare but when I received my food it was overcooked. I'll come back for the view of Niagara falls but maybe next time I'll order something that's not as easy to mess up."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Wednesday and they were only serving a few tables. Service was good. Food (Chicken and Chocolate lava cake) tasted great. If the rotating floor is making you feel naucious sit on the side that you're rotating forwards, not backwards. Expensive, but you're paying for the view too. Can tour the observation floors too."}
{"text":"Grossly overpriced for below average foods! The view is amazing at nigh sure, but the foods you have to put up with are pathetic. My fish dish was so poorly cooked and bland. How can they charge almost $40 for this? My friend's steak was tough and flavourless. Smh. But service was excellent and I was surprised by the big portions. I would still avoid this place since paying that much for the view doesn't make sense. Scaramouche has both fantastic foods and view."}
{"text":"Definitely do a dinner at the restaurant instead of paying to get up the tower! Admission to the CN tower is $32 per adult, but just add a couple more bucks and you can get a main at the restaurant! Much more worth it! You can access the viewing deck after your meal and the food is great too!"}
{"text":"This is one of my fav resturant.  There was only 1 time i went and the food was not up to standard, but overall the food is exceptional.  The view is amazing from up here and best part the tower revolves so you get to see the whole of Toronto.  Depending on your staff - some of them are friendly and others are just plain boring and professional with no converstaion.  Be prepared to spend at least $100 per person to enjoy your meal comfortably with drinks."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to 360 when taking friends to the CN tower.  I have been to the CN tower many times, and for the cost of admission, it's worth it to go to the restaurant for dining.  This is my 2nd time going to 360 for the prix fix lunch.  I think that it's a good experience to really just sit and enjoy the view while dining.  I highly recommend it.  The food is really delicious, and as long as the company is even better, you are guaranteed to have a great time.  The service that we received this time around was okay, but not as good as the previous visit."}
{"text":"I took my significant other to the 360 Restaurant as a fancy date to cap off our weekend together, and it absolutely blew our expectations away. We are still raving about the food and the experience as a whole two days later. 

A meal reservation grants you access to the viewing deck and glass floor rooms after eating; this isn't cheap on its own, so if you're going to enjoy the experience you may as well pay the extra for an incredible meal. Plus, the view from the dining room was 100% better anyways. 

We each ordered a two-course pre-fixed meal; she ordered an appetizer (smoke trout and potato chowder) and I ordered dessert (chocolate lava cake), and we shared all four plates. We both agree this was the best meal we've ever eaten, and she's done a bit of travelling, and I've eaten at some of the best rated places on both the east and west coasts (US). 

It's not just the food and view worth noting - we wanted to write reviews just to praise the staff and the atmosphere. From the time we entered the building, we were greeted by friendly people guiding us from one place to the next. The elevator to the top took about one minute, and there was a guide to explain a few things (which was nice, because talking helps to not focus on the fast-moving elevator rocketing away from the earth). 

We were told a full dinner rotation would take aprox. 72 minutes, and we estimated from sitting down until paying the check, it took us about 75 minutes. Incredible. The waiter was excellent. He came to check on us exactly when he needed to; we never felt rushed, and we never felt frustrated that nobody was paying attention. A server came around to re-fill our water every time they were low; again, we never even though about it. The first course came quickly, the second shortly after, and the third took just enough time to make us hungry for it, but not that we were impatient. Everything was perfectly paced, and that is a culinary SCIENCE that most places don't understand. 

There are some complaints about price, and no, the 360 is not a cheap place to eat. Understand the menu ahead of time. Our meal was about $140 without drinks or tip included. That being said, we knew that going in, and the experience was more than worth the price we paid. We both agree, we would go back again and try new dishes. 

TWO PIECES OF ADVICE: 

1) TRY THE CHOWDER! It's incredible! 

2) Go on a clear day. We changed our reservation because of a storm and overcast weather, and ended up going close to sunset on a perfect clear blue day. It was amazing, and easily the best date I have ever been on, and the perfect way to end my trip to Canada. Thank you 360! See you soon!"}
{"text":"Definitely a top notch place. 

The view of a Toronto from a window seat is gorgeous. The waiters there are very efficient to bring your drinks and to refill them. The best part is that when you are seated the seats move and by the end of your dinner you make a full rotate seeing Toronto all together. 

The food here was expensive, but was definitely worth every penny. I would suggest that everybody get a 2 course meal or 3 if u want a dessert or just more food. I got a 3 course meal and I was so full it was hard to walk.

After your dinner at the 360 Restaurant you can go down a floor to go to the glass floor and a walk way out side that you can roam freely in.

If your a tourist i would definitely recommend coming to the 360 Restaurant just make sure you make reservations."}
{"text":"Superb View, Mediocre Food, Average Service

We went there on June 5, 2014 to celebrate our anniversary.  The view was amazing but food was sub-par, definitely not worth the price but I guess part of the cost is the view. 

We requested a window seat when we made the reservation for 6:30 PM.  When we arrived at 6:25 PM, we were told we'd have to wait for 15 minutes for a window seat.  We ended up waiting for 10 minutes, not a big deal.

My husband ordered the Pan Seared Atlantic Salmon with Matane Shrimp and Tomato Vinaigrette that's part of the \"prix fixe\" menu and I ordered The Grand Platter from the seafood bar menu.  Salmon is a pretty safe choice and the dish was average, nothing to brag about.  My seafood platter on the other hand was a big disappointment.  Aside from the cocktail shrimps everything else was less fresh than I'd expect, certainly not worth the $95 price tag.

As for service, the waitress seemed nice though despite being one of only three tables served by her when we sat down we didn't get bread.  And when we asked her to take pictures for us she seemed a little annoyed at first.  

All in all it was an ok experience.  Nothing beats this view but don't have high expectation on the food."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying that the food at the restaurant was some of the best I have had. The views are some that you have never experienced before and it makes for such an enjoyable dinner. Where else can you sit 1100 feet up in the air, while revolving, and eating dinner? It was amazing in that aspect.
The gripe that I have is, that I was seated by myself around 7:45pm. I was alone for this meal, just for reference. My waiter didn't even come over to my table for 20 minutes!!!!! So for 20 minutes I'm sitting there looking at the views, trying to pass the time on my phone and watching other people enjoying their meals. He finally came over and asked if I was ready to order, no \"what would you like to drink\" or \"my apologies for the wait\". Seemed like since I was eating by myself that they cared less. I told him I hadn't even ordered a drink yet and that I would like to do so. I ordered Steam Whistle, a Toronto locally brewed beer. He brought that over to me and then I waited a little longer till he came back to take my food order. Thankfully the food didn't take as long to come out as he did, or I would've been there all night. The food was very good, yet the gnocchi that I had to start was rather small. I got the two course pre fixe menu. There were about five gnocchi and some sauce. The entree was a lot better and more filling. 
The nice part was that after my meal I was able to go to the observation deck and the glass floor. 
I would recommend since it is such a different and neat experience, but be prepared to wait and take awhile at the restaurant. Probably won't be going back"}
{"text":"To make this review short.

Service- good, but not the best I've ever had (like at Jacob's)

Decorations/design- very modern, sophisticated and clean

Good for:

-dates
-romantic stuff
-business (during the day)
-special occasion dinners (birthdays, anniversaries etc)

Now onto the food!

$65 prefixed

-caesar salad, not your ordinary one, the dressing had a bit of spice to it 4/5
-half chicken, nicely done and very satisfying 4/5
-dark chocolate tower, 3/5. I took off points because for dark chocolate it was still very sweet. But overall it was still good

a la carte

-prime rib ravioli, accompanied with a huge bone marrow, so if you like bone marrow this dish is a bonus for you. The ravioli with the prime rib stuffing was very good, delicate and one of the best i've had. They top the ravioli with veggies and it worked perfectly. The bone marrow was a surprise for me since it wasn't mentioned in the menu. I felt bad for wasting that huge thing, but it's not for me. 5/5

-mash potatoes (sides are extra $9) 2.5/5. This was very bland


Overall, you're paying for the view. The food is pretty good, bread basket is provided so if you're trying to save money, eat that and order a cheap main."}
{"text":"I visited this place with some friends while on a business trip and I'm so glad to have had the experience! I thought it might be one of those places where you pay for the view and the food and service would be lacking but I was surprised.  The wait staff was fabulous!  Very attentive but not obnoxious. My dinner was delicious; beef, green beans and potatoes cooked to perfection. What can I say about the view?  The view was amazing!  It rotates slow enough that you don't notice it.  Needless to say, I really enjoyed my dining experience."}
{"text":"La vue est fantastique, la nourriture correcte - tout comme le service. Le prix du menu (65$) est à relativiser avec le prix de la visite du belvédère seul (35$)... 

Il ne faut pas s'attendre à un gastronomique mais la vue, surtout au coucher du soleil, vaut vraiment le détour."}
{"text":"Spectacular view! Make sure you make a reservation a head of time ! For the location of the place prices are expensive but ok .
Service was good . Food was delicious also except one veal plate we got which was only ok ."}
{"text":"Tourist trap? Yes!  Pricey? Yes! But hey life is short and it is an experience not to miss.  We frequented this restaurant over the years but recently celebrated 2018 New Year here with our big family in Toronto and had a memorable night."}
{"text":"I made reservations on open table and at the time the only availability at a reasonable time for a family with kids (before 9pm) was at the Horizons restaurant (more like a Grille at the CN Tower). Although we were happy to be whisked past the 2.5 hour regular wait to ride up in the elevators we were surprised that our reservation had been upgraded to 360 but no one gave any explanation (we also didn't ask). Later when we passed by Horizons on the way out we thought it didn't look like the kind of place that would require reservations. So not sure what to make of that. The experience at 360 was of course amazing-breathtaking views. The outermost (window side) tables offer the best vantage point. Request one if possible. Food was delicious-overpriced but if you consider that the cost includes elevator fare I think it's more reasonable. The gazpacho was delicious as was the cod three ways. The chocolate three ways was a bit disappointing. The decaf coffee came out in a mini carafe that was about two cups worth. Our server was efficient and had a pleasant, professional demeanor."}
{"text":"Try it once.  Neat experience.  Decent food, but not as special as other fine dining restaurants.  It's tight up there, and not at all intimate, but you certainly see the city!  The chocolate tower desert looks amazing and tastes okay.  The port tenderloin was cooked nicely and the pancetta and pea tart was excellent--the highlight.  Don't expect to feel special here..."}
{"text":"Went here for anniversary dinner. We came at sunset and got the 3 course meal with a bottle of wine. Great view, really great food! Definitely a spot to try out if you haven't yet"}
{"text":"Another Toronto favourite, tough to get more Toronto than eating a great dinner at the top of the CN Tower while you slowly rotate and enjoy a full view Toronto. Kobe steak is fantastic an the lobster is choice. Highly recommend eating here at least once for the experience. Are you really a Torontonian if you haven't?"}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars
Service: 2.75 stars
Value: 3 stars

Dinner at the 360 Restaurant at the top of the CN Tower was the highlight of our trip in Toronto. We've never been to CN Tower nor 360 restaurant before. All five of us decided to try their prix fixe dinner (CAD $68, $55, and $21 for kid's meal). Each course had two to three selections to choose from. 

For the first course, we picked chicken mole sweet corn polenta tart and roasted squash bruschetta with toasted hazelnut pesto. The chicken mole was alright. The bruschetta was too hard... I think my mom makes a much better bruschetta. For appetizer, hubby had the King Cole duck three ways (duck prosciutto, duck galantine and duck rillette beamsville sour cherry chutney, with fennel mustard), which was unique and tasty. The duck galantine was particularly good with the bread. I ordered the smoked Atlantic salmon with caper berries and pumpernickel bread. Both appetizers were pretty good.

For the main course, hubby chose the slow roasted aged Canadian AAA prime rib of beef and he loved it. The beef was tender and so soft that it melt in his mouth. I had the pan seared fillet of Arctic Char, which was a disappointment. The fish was overcooked and dry. 

For dessert, we had the pumpkin cheesecake with butternut squash ice cream and cinnamon raisin brioche pudding with caramelized bananas and rum raisin ice cream. The portion of every dish was pretty big. We were all very full before the dessert came. So we only tried a little bit of the dessert. The food overall was average, not everything tasted good. What hot about this restaurant is the stunning view of Toronto from 1,151 feet above.

It seems to me they try to make the restaurant upscale, but their food needs improvement in taste and presentation. Also the service here was not outstanding too. Not all the waiters were nice. The one who served us didn't seem to be that friendly at all. He never smiled or greeted. But the bus person who helped our table was really nice and talkative, and helpful.

If you've never been to the top of CN Tower, eating at 360 restaurant worth a try plus the dinner includes the ticket to the observation deck. But once is enough, I wouldn't spend the money and eat here again."}
{"text":"The best part of this restaurant, in my opinion, is meant to be the view of the Toronto city core that you get from above the regular observation deck. And the view is breath-taking, especially at night. 

The service was very good, and the food was better than average. The portions more than justify the prices that are charged (on average the main course for dinner is around $40 to $50, but you do get a significant amount of food for the price). Given that you do get complimentary access to both the lookout and glass floor levels of the CN Tower with your meal ($32 per ticket for general admission), it is definitely worthwhile. 

Yes, it is a little gimmicky. Yes, you're unlikely to come back again and again and again given the price point and the food that falls short of being stellar. But the view of the city at night? Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Never again

Came here for a company's dinner. Had low expectations but I guess that was not enough to make me dislike the place so much.

The table that they sit us had this smell of raw eggs. I asked for the cheese platter as an appetizer and the bread looked old, the pecans looked old and the cheese was at most ok.

I had the beef cheeks as my main. It was not bad but not very good. The meat was dry. 

The service was bad. Rude. Unprofessional.

I would never had chosen this place and have to intention to come back here.

The view was nice but every time I look at the window I felt dizzy.

Never again"}
{"text":"Best view in the city!

A meal here - as you would expect - is fairly expensive, but I think it's worth it for special occasions. They have a vegetarian menu (not sure if vegan), which I appreciated. The service was great and the food was delicious. We didn't get a seat by the window, which I was disappointed about, so next time I will probably request that when booking a table.

Also, you get access to the viewing decks and the glass floor, so you can go down after your meal and enjoy the views!

Note: they only seem to have prix fixe menus"}
{"text":"I'm giving 4 stars because of the view. I had feta + watermelon for appetizer and steak for main and chocolate mouse for dessert. It was pretty good. When you add the view, it's totally worth it. If you have friends or family visiting you in Toronto, you can take them out for lunch here then enjoy the observation deck afterwards for free. Also, you don't need to wait for the elevator if you make a reservation which is awesome. I brought my parents here last summer and they loved it."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was also really good. The restaurant has a fantastic ambience to it, and a true million dollar view. 

Some people said that the food was just ok, which was definitely inaccurate to my experience. The food is certainly above the level of a Jack Astor's or a Kelsey's. I got the pan seared halibut and my girlfriend had the salmon. The people that are saying it's bad must be attending Michelin star restaurants in Paris, because the food at 360 certainly is good. Also, the prices are high on the menu but you also have to keep in mind that you're getting admission into the tower free of charge with the purchase of a main, so after you deduct that cost it's not THAT BAD, and it certainly isn't too bad with the view. 

A few notes... Try to go right around late sunset or just at night for that matter. View is good during the day, but exceptional at night -- something out of a movie. They do serve complimentary bread and butter which id opt for over a $15 appetizer. The dining room does take a while to make a full rotation, like half an hour, and they brought our food out overly quickly. Like within 8 minutes of ordering. With that said, we ate very slowly just to be sure to take it all in."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a great view. The food is alright. It is primary a 2 or 3 course prefixed meal. The tartar is pretty amazing. The tower signature dessert is pretty good also."}
{"text":"It has been probably 20 years since the last time I have been up to CN Tower and to eat. This time around, we went up for lunch. They have the pre-fix menu for $55 for lunch and it includes the admission to the Observation Deck below so not a bad deal. With reservations, they will try to seat you by the window with the 360 degrees view of the city, it takes about 90 minutes to go into a revolving circle. When I first sat there, I do feel it moving so it takes a little to get use to so that I won't get dizzy. It was a pretty sunny afternoon so the view was amazing.

I got the PEI mussels & clams as starter. The grilled calf's liver & crispy sweetbreads with maple smoked bacon and caramelized onions. It was something different than the normal steak or fish. I liked it, and polished off the plate clean. For dessert, I go the Lindt dark chocolate lava cake. It was very rich, not very sweet but heavy dessert. The service was good, very attentive. The entire atmosphere of course is the winner, up in the sky looking down and enjoying the skyline of Lake Ontario, Island airport, financial district, and the entire downtown."}
{"text":"I had a dinner with my grof here on a Sunday night. Food was OK,  not great but above average.  Staff were extremely nice,  they even have us 4 deserts on the house.  The views were stunning,  make sure you request a window table."}
{"text":"The food here was great! I had the Beef Tenderloin and would recommend it to anyone! Amazing .. Simply amazing ... Food .. Staff .. View! A must go if your in the Toronto area."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, but it didn't suit my taste. The deserts were so delicious though! Fun things to look at and overall a nice place to visit with family or friends!"}
{"text":"Great service good food large portion and on the expensive side but you can enjoy the view and the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Overrated. Overpriced. Fixed prices.

Your only menu choices are:
A) $65 for 2 courses
B) $80 for 3 courses 
C) a la carte meat and seafood for minimum $65 and up to $95.

-Appetizers are horrendously tiny. I had the beef tartar which was bland. 
-The gnocchi were literally fried potatoes that tasted awful - this is not gnocchi!! 
-The Atlantic Salmon main dish was good but the cheddar cheese on top was an odd addition. 

Avoid this tourist trap. You're better off paying for the tour to the top of CN which is cheaper than the restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Great view, service, and food. 
We had sea food platter and enjoyed it. 

You get to skip the line if you have restaurant reservation."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute 5 for the view and a much better bet than paying to go up and not eat. But manage your expectations, I give the food a 1 or 2. I've had cafeteria food that's far better. No creativity, thrown together, and has that feeling that you're eating at a business conference at the holiday inn express."}
{"text":"The food was alright, nothing too special. I had the 45-day old tenderloin steak and for that price, I think you can get much better at other places.

The only concern I had was the service. I had a reservation at 5:30pm and made a request to sit by the window for the view. When I got there, the seat was not offered to me because they were full, which is fine since they told me it's not guaranteed. When the couple sitting by the window left, I thought it wouldn't hurt to ask if we could be switched over to that table since no one is sitting there now. Shockingly, the waiter snapped back at me with a solid no, because other people are waiting, they're very busy, and we're not the only ones who want it. \"That's all I'm saying\" was how he ended his response.. and then he walked off. As a customer, I was utterly disturbed with his attitude. A gentle \"I'm sorry, we have others coming in already\" would have been fine with me.

Later on that night, the same waiter came over to shift our utensils for a dish that he thought was supposed to be ours. However, it turns out that the platter was for the table beside ours. Again, no apology whatsoever. 

For the price I'm paying for this restaurant, I felt like the service is way under par and was treated with disrespect. The view was excellent and I did not mind the food though."}
{"text":"Like other reviewer commented, if I'm rating on food alone, this place gets one star and no more. But adding on another for the experience. Because we were a party of 8, we were not able to sit close to the windows. The seat I was in was furthest away from the window and honestly, i couldn't see anything other than the sky. But relatives from out of town got a better view. If it's not because of free admission to observation deck and glass floor level, I doubt I'll ever want to revisit the restaurant. And on top of that service was poor. Had to ask for water so many times and the bus boys were very lousy and loud when collecting the plates. It's a shame. Such fantastic idea with a restaurant and they can't seem to get it together. But at the same time, why would they need to. Even with that kind of food and service, it was still full house."}
{"text":"Unfortunately Yelp doesn't give 1/2 stars. This place is more of a 3.5 star. The food was mediocre when compared to the price. You're really paying for the view. If this is the only touristy place you have time for, it's worth it. Ordered the two course lunch. Well portioned. 1st course - Squid Avocado Toast. Squid was a bit over cooked thus chewy. Pesto? Sauce was great. 2nd course - Pork belly and scallops. Scallops were perfect. Pork belly could be a bit more fatty. The peas were dry. Not sure what's going on with the garnish-ish side on the plate."}
{"text":"I took my parents here for Fathers Day who were visiting me from out of town but they have been to Toronto as visitors in the past. The best part of the experience was to sit and get a view of the city for a whole hour and a half (about 1.5 rotations so we could the city literally from a 360 perspective) from above ground level...like 351 meters. 

I had the Black Peppered Steak which was ok (3 star) and my parents had the Halibut and the Salmon respectively. I think they enjoyed their meal more than I did but for me the combination of being able to view the city on a clear day and having a nice meal with my parents was the real experience and something I recommend for anyone that wants to enjoy a special event with special folks from a sky high perspective :).

So all in all, food was a 3 but I give it a 4 for the combo of the view and the food!

P.S. I did see the waiters with some braised cornish hens (which is also on the menu) that looked pretty good."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5
Service: 4/5 
Ambiance: 4/5 the view creates the perfect setting

First time visiting Canada and this was a must go-to restaurant.  Decided to make lunch reservations to celebrate my hubby's bday and place lived to my expectations. 

Given its location and popularity, the price for lunch was reasonable ($55 p/person) and the prefix menu gave enough options to choose from. I ordered The Canadian steak as my entree and was extremely pleased. We followed waiter's recommendation and ordered the Lava cake for dessert... One word: DELICIOUS! 

If you are already planning to visit the tower and pay the $70 admission fee, mind as well pay a little extra and soak in the views from the comfort of your own table while enjoying a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"To go up the CN Tower, you can either pay thirty something dollars for the elevator ride OR you can choose to dine at the 360 restaurant (Keep in mind you have to spend a minimum amount for each person since you didn't pay for the lift tickets: i.e. you can't come up for free and just get a small dessert, you got to order a proper meal).   

We got the $75 Prix-fixe. This choice is a step up from the first Prix-Fixe option which is $65 per person. The reason we went for the $75 Prix-Fixe was because we just liked the appetizer and main menu options better than the other one. They also serve you a small pre-appetizer dish, which so very small, but delicious nonetheless. We tried the Sesame Albacore Tuna and liked it a lot. For the appetizer, I got the clam chowder and my girlfriend tried the smoked salmon appetizer, both were good. For main, we both got sirloin steak, I got mine medium, and she got hers medium well. The steaks were both seasoned very well and very good , mine was nice , moist and juicy, hers however was a bit on the dry side. After trying my steak she wished she had gotten a medium steak as well! 

For dessert we both got the Dark Chocolate Tower with sour cherries. The dessert really wasn't as good as we thought it would be. It was kind of plain, not chocolaty enough , not really as sweet as other dark chocolate cakes we are used to, but someone who likes their dessert less sweet might like this cake, the two of us not so much. 

In the end, we spent about 2 hours in the dining area, we  enjoyed our meal and especially the 360 degree view which was super nice, and then we spent about an hour at the look out area up stairs.

The Service was excellent; out server was very personable and quite  knowledgeable and gave us a lot of info about the history of restaurant and answered our random questions about the  different parts of city we could see from up there! 
Overall, the food was pretty good, price sort of high but you get a pretty amazing view and the food covers the lift tickets, I won't be coming here everyday, but if I have a visitor from out of town, or for special occasions, I think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"A landmark attraction of Toronto, this place did not disappoint even with it's prices. 

I feel when you pay for a meal at a restaurant, you are paying for so much more than just the food they put on your plate. You are paying for the service you get, you are paying for the atmosphere, you are paying for the experience. This idea is very well illustrated by the 360 restaurant. 

What I mean to say is, you might feel just a slight bit cheated by the prices if all you had to show for it was the food. While the food itself was quite delicious and not at all disappointing, the prices were high for what was being served. But again, I stress that you really can not divorce the meal from the experience, and the experience of eating at the 360 restaurant is truly amazing. 

I made sure to book my reservation around sunset, and I was glad to have thought to do so. We also reserved a table that was nearest to the windows without any difficulty. The view is just phenomenal. I'm not afraid to say I've been up in a great many towers in my day (the Space Needle, the Washington Monument, London Tower, Ostankina Tower in Moscow, etc., etc.) and this one definitely holds it's own. You are way, way, way, higher up than the Space Needle, for example. There is a great view of the lake to one side of the tower, and all the city to the other side. Straight below is a view right into the Rogers Centre, but don't expect to be able to catch a game... the people down there are miniscule. 

A few things to keep in mind if you decide to dine here: 

1- make a reservation. They sell out, especially on weekends. 
2- while your table may be rotating on the outside ring of the restaurant, the bathrooms on the inside of the ring do not rotate. This means the bathroom will be in a different place every time you have to go, which can be quite tricky once you've had a drink or two. 
3- try to go on a clear day during the sunset. It's just the best way to experience the place. 

Don't let the price thing deter you. It's $20 just to get up in the tower to tour it without a meal, and that's comped if you have a 360 reservation. So keep that in mind. After you have eaten, they let you putz around the observation deck at your leisure.


edit: I just realized I wrote the entire review without even mentioning the service or the food. I guess that goes to show you what was memorable about this place. The service was not bad, but didn't stand out for any reason. I'm pretty sure I got a steak entree and it was good, no real complaints, but again you can see it was pretty forgettable. Oh well. I still stick with my 4 stars."}
{"text":"We're both from Toronto and do not frequent this tourist location. However, the revolving restaurant concept sounded quite appealing and we've heard amazing things about the view.

Service. The service was amazing. The reason I say this is because, on top of providing quality service, our server (and many other servers) acted as photographers for many tables. They were all happy to do this extra favour.

Food. This is where the perfect rating dropped to two or three-stars. Food was very mediocre, nothing special. We both ordered steaks and had a few cocktails on the side. The portions were quite large and filling but we both didn't finish our meals, not because of the portion size, but the taste wasn't appetizing enough to finish.

Atmosphere/view. This is where I gave it five-stars. We're both from Toronto and seeing the entire city at such a height, in one rotation was pretty amazing, especially at night over the city lights. Lots of photos were taken. The speed at which the restaurant rotated was not too bad, however you did not need a drink to feel as though you're tipsy. Forgot to mention, it was perfect place for date night.

Price. Food was definitely not worth the value. Overpriced food for mediocre taste. But hey, I'm pretty sure everyone shows up for the view.

Overall, I would say the amazing view saved the ratings from dropping to a two-star or three-star. This is definitely a place you'd like to go once and save the photos as memories. Don't see myself coming back, unless they continue to do a prix-fix Winterlicious menu."}
{"text":"Best views of Toronto hands down! The seasonally changing menu features many Canadian sourced ingredients all of are prepared to perfection! Did I mention the service? It was spectacular too! This place is a must!"}
{"text":"We dined on July 26 evening. It was a bit pricy comparing to similar restaurants but still acceptable considering the \"price\" for the tickets.  While, the quality of food was just so....so  so did the service. Overall, a nice place to visit once, not many."}
{"text":"It was the second time I went there and once again, it was just okay. Yes, the atmosphere is great. If you have never been here, for the experience's sake, make a visit. But would this place be my \"regular\"? Not really. Sure, great view IF the weather is great, but for the price you pay, the food is not that great. Instead of $70 for lunch, I have had better service and better food for about $50 dinner. The presentation of the food is absolutely great. But taste-wise, it is just good, not exceptional. Will come again only if I am with a company that has never been to this restaurant before."}
{"text":"What a view! 
My boyfriend and I were visiting TO, and figured we should try the famous 360 restaurant.  We arrived half an hour before our reservation, hoping to sit at the bar and wait -  however a table (next to the window!) was already ready for us. We started with oysters (served with cocktail sauce, horseradish, and lemon).  They were fresh and delicious. I had the best escargot I've ever tasted! They were served in a roasted garlic-y sauce with pieces of cherry tomatoes... mmmm.  I also had the prime rib, which was good, but not well done enough for my taste, and a rosemary infused bread-pudding type side.   My boyfriend had the tasting menu with wine pairings.  I'm too engrossed in the escargots to remember what he had, but he loved it! Dessert was beautifully presented, and the lychee martini had a nice kick! Also, if you order a main, you don't have to pay for the ride up. 
Service was friendly and attentive, although we couldn't fully understand our waiter's accent. 
Overall it was an amazing culinary experience to be tried at least once (or more if you don't mind the high price tag)."}
{"text":"For the penny pincher types, it is actually cheaper to NOT do the Pre-Fix ($65), which includes CN Tower tickets in the meal.  Instead, people should buy the tickets separately and purchase the meals off of the pre-fix options ($19 or less per entree).  No matter what, you have to pay for the tickets, so you may as well avoid the 15% tip on them in the Pre-Fix.  If you want to save money further, avoid the libations.

Overall the meal was good.  We had a Atlantic Salmon appetizer, which was probably the most gourmet dish we had all evening; the fish was fresh and paired very well with a rich goat cheese and a thick, buttery, Caesar-esque sauce topped with some light greens and a hint of pickled red onion for a little bite.  Unfortunately, it came in a very small portion.  My wife settled on a beautiful looking Duck Breast entrée that was pretty good.  I had the Prime Rib, which was pedestrian and lacked a sauce.  The ice cream and cookies dessert we chose was basic and just okay.  What really made the experience for us was the main attraction; the 360 rotating view in the comfort of the warm restaurant.  That is what really makes the meal worthwhile in my book."}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant!  Not only is the location unlike any other place in the world but also the good was quite exquisite.  Even though my palate is not really accustomed to the Franco-English cuisine, I didn't find the dishes foreign at all.  I personally chose to play safe and had the Salmon with their garden salad and yet, I still had unique experience because the way the dish was put together.  People in my party had the roast beef and the lamb.  Both were really happy in the end.

Lastly, we had a chocolate(s) sampler and it was worth the price of admission.  That and the mango sorbet made our meal very satisfying.

Obviously, the view is incredible.  We were able to watch the Blue Jays game from our table! (really small but still impressive).

Anyway, you cannot miss this spot when you come to Toronto."}
{"text":"Great dining experience with breathtaking 360 views of Toronto! The restaurant is located in Toronto's iconic CN Tower.  Upon entering, you will see a long wait to enter the tower.  However, if you're lucky to score reservations at the 360 Restaurant, you will happily bypass this long line after checking in at the restaurant's ground level desk, and will thereafter be able to proceed to take an elevator up to the restaurant.  My beau was able to get reservations and get a wonderful window table for us.  One of the best dining experiences I've had -- great food, wine, service, ambiance and views.  Entrance into the touristy area/level is included, too!  Perfect place for a romantic dinner or special occasion!"}
{"text":"Scam, Scam, Scam. This was single handedly the worst dinning experience of my entire life. I would not suggest this to anybody ever. This has completely ruined Toronto for me. I intended to have drinks and desert here and made a reservation through open table and it notified me that I would get a complementary ticket for the special glass bottom walk with a full meal, but I was not interested in this. What it did not tell me was that I would be charged the price of a full meal whether I ate it or not. This is a complete scam, and one that I would expect from a cheap restaurant looking to take advantage of tourists because that is exactly what they did. Desert for 6 people and not even all of us had a drink, over $400. If you want to come here be prepared to be treated like garbage and be robbed. This is exactly what will happen to you. I was misled and misinformed and taken advantage of. This has completely ruined my perception of Toronto and will never return. I wish I could give lower than one star and would be reimbursed for the food I was not served and did not eat."}
{"text":"The revolving platform restaurant at the CN Tower is pricey, but eating here pays for the ticket up to the observation deck. The premise of a revolving restaurant is pretty cool in itself, and it was pretty cool to get a 360 degree view of Toronto.

The service was good. Food was on-pace with the speed I ate, and while some may complain it be slow, it also depends on when you go. The waiter was amicable, better than most other restaurants.

I had the Prix Fixe. For the appetizer, I had the Caesar salad; the main course was the Stuffed Chicken with Parmesan; and dessert a Chocolate Tower. The salad was prepared well, visibly appealing, and pretty good. Five pieces of Romaine topped with italian dressing, croutons, ricotta cheese.

The main course featured two pieces of lightly fried chicken thigh, stuffed with cheese and spinach. Side was mash potatoes and two baby tomatoes. The chicken was lightly dry but still tender, although the taste was one dimensional. Presenation and portion was great though.

For the Chocolate Tower I was expecting some sort of Ice Cream or cake topped together dripping or covered in chocolate. Instead it was a 5 inch tall cylinder shaped mousse, wrapped with stripes of chocolate, topped with a piece of dark chocolate. It was declious.

Overall, while it is pricey, it was worth the view, the good portioned food, quality presentation, and the classy atmosphere. Definitely a must go for tourists of Toronto."}
{"text":"Great experience, the revolving restaurant is a must if you have not experienced before. The service and food were good but you pay for the view, good for a special occasion. The Horizons restaurant is 1 floor below the 360 restaurant more casual, cheaper but does not rotate."}
{"text":"The 360 restaurant in Toronto was NOT worth the money.
We had made a reservation for a Thurs. the first night Toronto of 3 nights.  We were told we needed to order at LEAST the 2 course pre fix dinner in order to receive the pass for the observation level.  Needless to say, we ordered the 3 course pre fix dinner-$160 for both of us without tax or tip. ( I had the veal which was very greasy , and my husband's vegetable was way undercooked.) As the evening progressed there was no break in the clouds and we could NOT anything out of the window.  After dinner we politely asked to speak to the manager so we could obtain a pass for the next day ( or night)  The manager absolutely refused to give us a pass.  The restaurant was not very busy, so even if everyone in the restaurant asked for a pass it would not have been that costly.  This was just BAD business.  Needless to say, we did not return to the CN Tower and we never saw the view that is so famous for Toronto.
Food was very mediocre. WAY too expensive for the evening.
The manager needs a course of customer service.
Try the Stratosphere in Las Vegas for an enjoyable dinner and view.

{"text":"Came for the tourist-ish gimmick, stayed for the delectable dining and impeccable service. 

The 360 degree spinning view was beautiful. The view of Toronto was all we hoped it to be. The true surprise though was the food and service. 

Very expensive for a family of 4 but it really is meant to be a special treat. The 4 of us all loved our meals and agreed each was one of the best meals we'd had. 4/4 itself is a very rare occurrence, especially with teenagers and picky eaters. 

We had the lamb chops, stuffed pork tenderloin, prime rib and chicken linguine. All 4 meals beautifully presented, good portions, fresh and flavorful. 

If I'm ever in Toronto again, I'll definitely come here to check out the view in the evening and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"The view is magnificent but the food is subpar for the \"fancy\" pricing. The dessert is delicious but how hard can it be to make chocolate taste great?! If you decide to go just get dessert + tea/coffee ;)"}
{"text":"Not sure why the posts are low?  We had great food and service, lovely views. Full access all the way up CN - quite spectacular!  Worth dinner for the admission. They have s separate vegetarian menu if you ask!"}
{"text":"As a visitor to Toronto, my husband said, \"The CN Tower is one of Toronto's most famous attractions.  If I came here on my own as a tourist, I would think the 360 Restaurant would be the best way to get the best Toronto had to offer.  After that experience, I would be happy to vote for Trump.\"

As a GTA native, I was extremely disappointed by the service at the 360 Restaurant.  My husband and I were arriving back in Toronto from our honeymoon and wanted to have one last special experience in the city before going home so we booked a reservation.  Upon arrival, we sat down, marveled at the view for a few minutes, decided on drinks, appetizers, and mains, and then my husband went to the bathroom and came back before we even saw our waiter (10-15 minute wait).  Since we had already decided on everything, we had hoped to put our complete order in right away.  Upon arrival at the table, our server simply asked, \"Do you want anything to drink?\"  When we gave our drink orders he said okay and walked away without giving any introduction or asking if we needed/wanted anything else, etc.
As a side note, we ordered a signature drink (which is supposed to come with a complimentary signature glass) and when our drinks were delivered, the signature glass was plopped on the table in a plastic wrapper.  It looked extremely tacky and took up space on the already small table.  Though I can understand that it was probably given to us at that time in order to avoid forgotten signature glasses, there must be a better way to present the souvenir.

As a former server, I was appalled at the service in such an expensive and seemingly high-class restaurant.  On our way out, a manager asked about our experience and wanted to \"take care of it\" but basically said that he would only correct our horrible experience if we stayed that evening.  Unfortunately, we had already wasted 45 minutes and were unimpressed - we expressed that we would want to return on a different evening to start the experience over.  We gave the manager our email and never heard from them.  I also tried to call back a couple of days later to give more detailed feedback, was told I would receive a call back from a manager once they were done \"running around on the floor\" and never received a call back.

Didn't get to try the food, customer service nightmare, glad I got my signature glass for my wasted hour."}
{"text":"The only thing it has going for it is the view! I didn't like the food or the prices! Although the food presentation and overall atmosphere was great, I just wish it tasted as good as it looked. Service was really old school, I did not like it."}
{"text":"I made a reservation a couple of days before and only had a couple of options for dinner time - around 4 or after 9 pm. If you want to eat around dinner time I recommend making a reservation early. 

My boyfriend and I both ordered the 2 course prix fixe ($65 each). One of us got an appetizer and one got the dessert. We had the bi-costal fresh fish and seafood chowder  (pretty good, but was not really a chowder like I was expecting), alberta prime rib of beef (very large serving), 45 day aged beef tenderloin (good but not worth the $12 supplement), and the chocolate three ways. We both ordered a signature drink (fruit punch and some sort of mint lemonade). Both were good, and we were happy to get a glass to take home.

Since I was in Toronto for a vacation, I thought it was worth it overall due to the view. The food was good but could have been better for the price. Server was very good and took many pictures of my boyfriend and I when I asked for one."}
{"text":"Amazing views as expected but the food and service was terrible. I live in Toronto and I just wanted to enjoy the view of our city on my birthday. I knew the food wasn't going to be Michelin Star standard but the service and quality of food made it difficult to have an enjoyable experience. Just way below standard for the price they are asking. They kept on pushing deserts on us. We were just ready to leave."}
{"text":"Great view and good food. Instead of paying a fee to check out the CN tower, we decided to get dinner there which includes access to the tower. We didn't have to wait online for the elevator ride and was taken straight to the restaurant. The restaurant is constantly rotating so if you have motion sickness, you might feel the rotation bothering you a bit. Overall, good experience."}
{"text":"We decided to go here for the first time to celebrate a birthday last year. Very pricey place to be for very little food. Fine dining of course! Service was great but the food - ok. Wouldn't like to go back there again"}
{"text":"Wonderful meal with incredible views and we really liked our fun waiter Michael.  For a touristy location we were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. We each chose one of the price fixed meals and found them to be a very nice way to go. Order and sit back and just enjoy The experience. We. Sat by the window, had a rain storm go bye and saw the sunset to boot! Loved our Toronto experience!"}
{"text":"Warning: Do NOT order the seafood platter

I took my partner here for our anniversary thinking it would be kitschy touristy fun. Though we're both locals, he had never been up the tower and I thought it would be cute to have him experience what I had experienced as a kid in the 90s. My expectations were pretty low for this restaurant, and I knew full well that this place would be a tourist trap. But damn, did this place set a new standard for terrible. From the moment you sit down at your table, you quickly realize that their MO is to drive volume rather than deliver quality food and service. The 2-tiered seafood platter we ordered was the perfect example of this. You could tell that everything - from the rubbery, tasteless lobster, to the still-defrosting crab legs - was cooked and prepared hours in advance, if not the day before. I couldn't quite figure out what the kitchen staff had done to screw up the oysters. You would think all it takes is to have fresh oysters cleanly shucked, but they came out butchered and tasted like it was going bad. The prime rib that followed was another comedy act in itself. The taste was bland as to be expected, but the real kicker was when the busboy came to offer us horseradish and started BANGING his serving spoon on our plate. I must have made several pained expressions on my face, because when it came time for dessert, our server offered it to us on the house. He was nice.

Oh well, we laughed and were amused with how bad the meal was. He got to go up the CN Tower, finally. Come here for a drink and enjoy the view. Just don't stay for dinner. 

P.S. I wouldn't trust them to make your favorite cocktail either. 
P.P.S. To management: if you're going to charge $22 for a 6 oz glass of wine, your servers better know how to describe them.
P.P.P.S To management: when your customer kindly asks one of your servers if he could move closer to the window, don't have them tell the customer to get up and speak to the host himself. Either have the waitstaff ask the host on the customer's behalf or tell him politely that there's a likely wait time."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fun night out or want to impress your clients, 360 restaurant is where it is at!  I have been a few times this year and every time I have been very impressed the calibre of service as well as the quality of food.  Considering the fact, you are close to 1,500+ ft from the ground, they do a decent job of serving yummy meals.

Look out for the little fish markers on the windows, they are fun to spot as you rotate around the city.

The only downside is that it is a bit tourist; they make you take a photo before you head up.  Bonus, you get to access to the viewing deck at the CN Tower, it is included as a part of the restaurant experience.  You can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and atmosphere. The restaurant was everything I expected it to be. Our reservation was at 9pm, but we were still able to view the city from all angles. I started with one of the restaurant's signature cocktails. Toronto's View From The Top consisted of Rosewood Estates Spiced Mead Dilon's Method 95 Vodka, white cranberry and orange bitters. Great, strong drink!!! You had an option of a two/three course meal. I had the hearts of romaine and  baby kale salad. This salad included 360 Caesar vinaigrette, maple glazed bacon lardons, focaccia croutons and shaved parmigiano. This salad was so good, I left nothing on the plate. For an entrée, I ordered the pan roasted duck breast. The King Cole duck breast was finished with pine sea salt flakes, maple and chili jus, brandied cherries, cauliflower and allspice puree with rainbow Swiss chard. This was a great dish as well. 

The service was great and this place is good for dates/meeting with a group of friends. I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and it is a must do if you're ever in Toronto."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto on business and made reservations at 360 with a co-worker.  Our experience was nothing short of perfect!  We arrived a few minutes prior to our reservation, and were taken right upstairs on a dedicated elevator.  We were seated immediately at a window seat, can't beat that!

We had already decided prior to arriving that we would be doing the prix fixe menu.  $79 (CAD) is an excellent deal for a three course meal - approximately $62 USD.  We don't have a comparable restaurant in CT view wise, but at any fine dining restaurant I would expect to pay upwards of $75 USD for a comparable meal.  I thought it could get pricey if opting for the steak or seafood options, but I was very happy with the prix fixe menu.

We both loved our food and ate everything.  I believe the menu changes seasonally and had just changed over to the spring menu.  The portions were substantial, plating was lovely, and taste was great.  I had the Canadian smoked salmon - 3 different types, with brioche.  Definitely worth the $6 supplement!  The chicken main dish was huge and quite tasty.  Then I was so thrilled to find a lemon tart on the menu - I love lemon desserts but they are so often overlooked.  It was great!  I opted for the suggested wine pairings on my first two courses and was quite impressed.  This was my first time trying Canadian wine!

The view is the reason you're there - it takes 72 minutes to rotate around.  They time everything perfectly so that you're not waiting a long time for your food, but you aren't rushed either.  We got our check just after we had completed a full rotation.  

The price of the meal includes entry to the observation levels, including the Sky Pod.  The Sky Pod requires timed tickets, so my suggestion would be to leave the restaurant and go there immediately, to lock in your time (ours was about 45 minutes later) and then go wander around the other levels to pass the time.  Regular CN Tower tickets are $38, plus $15 for the Sky Pod, so getting this for free with dinner is really a great deal - plus you skip all the lines and waiting for the elevators going up.

This is definitely a must do if you are visiting the area.  Without a doubt, I will go back when I next visit the Toronto area.  I think it would be cool to go during a baseball game when the roof is open."}
{"text":"This is really an amazing restaurant experience. Dining more than a thousand feet above Toronto on a revolving platform is a truly unique experience.

The nice thing about this restaurant is that it doesn't just rely on the revolving platform to provide a great experience. The food is a true fine dining experience. Everyone's dishes were really good and I'd definitely recommend the cod three ways.

Be careful when you go to the bathroom! The tables keep revolving and if you don't remember your section you can get very disoriented!"}
{"text":"Well worth it to come here for a meal..if you decide to get the Prix fixe menu. The Prix fixe menu allows you to enjoy not only a good 2 or 3 course meal but also full access to the observation deck and glass floor level which would normally cost you about $35 admission. The Prix fixe lunch menu costs $56 before tax and tips for the 2 course meal and $69 for the 3 course meal. 

I came up for lunch and had the 3 course meal. I ordered the cheese platter as an appetizer, the Atlantic salmon as an entree and the Lava cake for dessert. The appetizer and the dessert was great, I would recommend for others to try, the Atlantic salmon however was small in its portion size (to the point where I stole food off my family members plates). The entree I would recommend is the prime rib, it is well worth the extra $8 to get, it's cooked well and the serving size is very generous."}
{"text":"GREAT FOR A SPECIAL OCCASION!!!

We went to the 360, or \"The Top of Toronto\" as it used to be called, for my Birthday.  This place used to have a bad reputation for it's poor food and gimmick of revolving so that you were too spun to notice the sub standard fare, but a few years ago they completely redid everything, including bringing in a world-class chef and really turning it into a 5 star fine dinning establishment.  The well stocked wince cellar is also a great addition, although I doubt that the wine is kept in a cellar when one is so high up!  

What a wonderful choice for a special occasion, with not only the wonderful view but the gourmet food!  I had the snails for my appetizer and they were the best I've ever had.  Since then I've said a few times when ordering this dish that they are not as good as when I had them at 360.  Every course was expertly paired with a nice wine, and the wait staff was professional and courteous.  Don't take too long in the washroom though for as the outer table ring continues to revolve while you are gone it can be then hard to find your way back to your table, as it will not be where you left it!
 
Although it was very expensive, it was worth it for a magnificent experience, although I'd only want to do it every few years and only for a special occasion. It was also worth it that the elevator was included, as well as going to the Observation Deck after our meal.  People normally pt $30 - $40 to go to the top, but this is included when everyone in your group has at least the 2 Course Fixed Meal."}
{"text":"The views are absolutely amazing, but their food is below average. Anyways, it's still worthy it to go there least once just for the stunning views and experiencing the revolving restaurant."}
{"text":"Haha... this place is a serious joke. 

My boyfriend and I came here one day to celebrate a special occasion and it was really foggy so the view was just white. (Which is fine since it's not their fault, it's the weather.) 

What really bothered me was the waiter's attitude. He had a very snobby attitude and treated us like we were not good enough to eat there (?!) Not to mention the food was just not worth what we paid. We both got steaks and even the Keg makes better steaks. :/

Probably never go back."}
{"text":"Great service, food, decor and lighting. Recommend to arrive a couple hours before sunset to enjoy the view to the max. Very romantic."}
{"text":"Great quality food. The waiter could have been less arogent though lol. Although i know my stuff when it get to drinks. For sure recommend visiting here if you havent already"}
{"text":"Fantastic views of the city, mediocre food. The staff were nice enough. It's worth going for lunch or dinner if you're already considering going up the CN Tower since the price difference is not that much, but I wouldn't go back necessarily for the food, just the experience of the rotating restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was no where near good enough to demand the price.  I don't feel bad about going, however, because the view is spectacular, and the whole freaking place rotates around.  The Tower and the view are amazing, the food isn't, and the price is in double eagle steak house land."}
{"text":"No complaints. Remember when considering the restaurant that you will be SAVING the $32/person fee that is typically charged just to go up the elevator to the viewing areas. 2 adults, the 75/person price fixe menu, a glass of wine and an 18% tip was $215.    Sounds like a lot, but a nice dinner on the ground in downtown toronto would have been at least 1/2-2/3 of that and I still would have paid $64 for us to go up to the cn tower observation deck!"}
{"text":"To just get it out of the way, the best argument for eating here is probably that it's a nicer way to visit the CN tower.  You get your own elevator, no waiting, and much nicer conditions (i.e. a comfy chair while being served a decent meal) for your sightseeing visit!  I added a star due to the view alone.

We came for a Friday lunch in late November, so crowds were not at their height - which was just fine.  We got window-side seats, which was just awesome.  The atmosphere is comfortable, fairly spacious (not crowded together) and it was a really beautiful view.  We had the Prix-Fixe lunch which is all we were offered, for $55/person.  Here's the blow-by-blow:

APPETIZERS
Caesar Salad - good, w-bacon and big sheets of parmesan.
Pork-and-Apple Sausage - fine, not memorable

ENTREES
 the Supreme of Chicken - yummy mashed potatoes.  Chicken has some spice that was not to our liking - not quite sure what that was.  
Moroccan Lamb Shank - succulent, fell off the bone, delicious sauce, quite good

DESSERT
Apple & Cherry Crumble - yum
Trio of Creme Brulee (banana, raspberry, mango) - fine, not served warm as creme brulee should be in my opinion.  Love the 3 flavor choices.  Was served w- a dollop of whipped cream on each, which is unnecessary calories imo, so I didn't eat that.  They gave me a 2nd banana instead of mango by mistake, which was ok w-me.

Obviously the meal is overpriced, but if you factor in that $25 of it would have gone for the elevator cost, choosing to eat here is a very viable option if you want to visit the CN Tower around lunch time.  As a package, I recommend it, probably even more so at times when the Tower is crowded.  You get to go from the restaurant to the viewing deck and glass floor areas anyway."}
{"text":"I've lived in Toronto for many years and of course the CN tower is thought of as a tourist trap.  I came here for a celebration dinner with low expectations, but was completely shocked with how breathtaking the view was! 

I ordered the $68 prix fixe. For appetizer, I had the meat + cheese board served with an amazing side of seedy mustard. I also tried my cousin's escargot dish, which was packed with flavour - albeit the accompanying toast was a little burnt. For the main, I chose the Prime Rib and it was juicy, tender and perfectly cooked. My only complaint is that the portion was just wayyy too big (hmm around 12oz. I would say?). I had the Dark Chocolate Tower for dessert and it was too rich and decadent for my taste. I moved on to try the Maple Walnut Roulade with Meringue - the combinations were so creative and tasted excellent together!

The view was completely captivating. I felt like a kid trying to look up and down Yonge street, locating Queen's Park, the OCAD building (which really stands out btw) and anything that caught my eye! It was so much fun watching the Porter planes take-off and land too! Three hours later, I was standing on the deck, still staring at the view and getting all dreamy eyed from the sunset. I'm so glad I made the trip here!"}
{"text":"Been here in the past and the food was sub par for the price. Decided to come back for our 1st anniversary and try out the food again and to our surprise the food was a lot better and our server Geoff was amazing was very knowledgeable with the food menu and drinks. We ordered the seafood platter with a tomato salad and smoke salmon for our appetizers, the seafood platter was a great choice but the salmon was a little heavy on the seasoning side. For our appetizer we ordered the Lam chops and bison steak both we cook wonderful with a lot of taste and very fresh. Will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Il faut se rendre compte que certaines tables n'ont pas une belle vue du tout, et si on a la malchance d'y tomber, le repas est gâché. Mais les plats sont bons, en particulier si on considère qu'un ticket pour monter sur la tour coûte $36."}
{"text":"It was definitely expensive for lunch, but it was good too. Of course the views are what makes it worth it. I'd rather pay to eat and then get to see the views than just pay the fee to go up, but that's just me! It was so nice to look out over Toronto while having lunch. I am scared of heights so the elevator up scared me haha. I had the Shaved Niagara Prosciutto as my starter and it was very good. Then I had the Rainbow Trout as my main dish and ice cream for dessert! Now I probably won't go back again, but as a one-time touristy thing I think it was worth it. Then again, my gf paid!"}
{"text":"Great view. Everyone in my party loved their food. Sure a little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"So if someone ever told you that they loved the experience at 360, believe me its because they were mesmerized by the view. Food is below average

I had come here for dinner with family and as I mentioned, loved the bright view of Toronto on  a sunny evening.

If you are coming here for first time, I suggest go for a prix-fixe menu as its a food and entry combo. Its double the price but worth it. Also go for 2 course only( if despite of knowing that they serve average food why would you want to eat three course...but entirely up-to you)

Plus when you are eating, you are slowly circling around the city with a view.

Service at this place is good...speedy and nice..

Food: I ordered Ziti with BC wild mushrooms and Dark Chocolate Tower and both failed to impress me.

Ambiance: OK but view- spectacular!!

Therefore this place deserves a 4 star :)"}
{"text":"Me and my husband dined there one night. It was pretty empty and maybe it's because less tourist during winter season..

For appetizer, we both got salad $20. Came with 3 pieces of lettuce and bacon crumbs.

One of our main dish was lamb shank. The lamb shank was raw and completely reeked like they used rotten meat. The manager came to our table and apologized and offered us a complimentary entree. You can see the rotten lamb shank in the photo I have posted.

Dessert was cheesecake. I can tell the cheesecake was frozen and they just thawed it with garnish. What a disappointment.

Our bill was $250 and we were served rotten and undercooked food for our $50 main dish."}
{"text":"Feeling very disappointed about this place but at the same time, the reviews were on point.
The food is horrible. It's not fresh, we felt rushed, and waaay too expensive for what it is.

The only reason why I would go back there is to grab a nice drink with a beautiful view (because the view really is amazing, especially since the restaurant rotates around the tower so you don't miss a thing!).

So don't waste your money on bad food, just have a nice drink and enjoy the incredible view."}
{"text":"We were celebrating a very special occasion and wanted to do something a little out of the ordinary.  I had never been to the 360 Restaurant before and when this was proposed as an idea, I thought why the heck not?  The reservation process was dead-easy (thank-you OpenTable). 

When we showed up, there's the hassle of all the security measures although you kinda feel VIP standing in separate lines PLUS you didn't pay $22.99 for the elevator ride.  The annoying part was the obligatory souvenir photo.  A nice family was having their photo taken when we arrived.  The staff member told us they would take our picture, but not to worry - you don't have to buy it.  Seeing as we were actually trying to beat the last 2 guests of our party as this was a surprise, we were in a hurry.  I didn't have time to wait for a cheesy photo.  I tried to get out of the photos, but she wasn't having it.  Based on her reaction, it seemed like she thought I was trying to jump the line.  Thankfully, one member of our group did a much better job of explaining the situation and we were granted a hall pass.

When we got to the entrance of the 360 there were loads of people just everywhere.  What's the deal?  I thought you could only get there if you had a reservation?  They check this downstairs before they let you ride up.  We waited for about 60 years before even getting to the hostess desk.  I confirmed the reservation and they told me our table wasn't ready yet.  They were kind enough to find us a place to sit and wait.  Poor planning... it was right at the elevators.  We were waiting there long enough to start attacking the candy bowl.  And also long enough that our guest of honour arrived and caught us (unprepared) on the couches.  SURPRISE!  (Fail.)

We waited another little while still and then were finally seated.  Thankfully, we got a good window table.  I didn't even think to make that request, but once inside the restaurant, I realized there are some tables that seriously suck in terms of the view.  I didn't know what to expect of the rotating experience and actually feared motion sickness, but it's slow enough that you don't really feel it (and it's not a disaster for the servers).  I was told it takes about 73 minutes for a full rotation.  Our timing was excellent as we saw full daylight, sunset and night time. It was interesting to see the city from a different perspective, plus play the guessing game of which buildings are which.  

Dining:  
The wine list is extensive, but offers some reasonably-priced options as well as some bottles in the thousands of dollars.  Beautiful wine cellar in the center.

The menu offers a couple of prix fixe options.  One at $55 and a another (better) one at $68.  The $68 offers an amouse-bouche and the better appetizers such as escargot and entrées such as prime rib.  There are also plenty of à la carte options.  Appetizers averaged around $16.  The entrées varied from $35 to $60 per lb for seafood.  There were also seafood platter options, the largest at $325.  It would feed quite a few people, so it's not super outrageous when compared to the rest of the menu.

I opted for the à la carte, but did a terrible job of it.  My appetizer of a half-dozen oysters ($18) were fantastic.  Gigantic malpeques!  Although only served with horseradish and seafood sauce.  I prefer more interesting toppings.  My main was an eggplant vegetarian dish.  The eggplant portion was breaded and pan-fried.  Absolutely delicious.  There was subpar paneer and some 'protein'.  All served with a curry-flavoured sauce.  It was actually very filling, but I only really enjoyed the flavours of the eggplant.  My dessert was by far the worst option.  I ordered the caramelized pineapple with star anise, Vanilla cream, galangal sorrel gelato ($12) because I love pineapple.  Bad move.  I didn't realize galangal (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galangal) and sorrel (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorrel) are both herbal/medicinal flavours.  I thought it was weird.  Others called it offensive.  It was described as the flavour of Buckleys.  Lesson learned: never let me order dessert for you.

We then went downstairs to the observatory.  Jumped on the glass floor, walked around outside, hung out at the look-out.  The look-out now has cool digital viewfinders? binoculars? (I don't know what they're called).  That's new since I was there last.

It was fun as an experience, but a little overpriced for the food and service.  There was nothing overly exciting on their menu.  Pretty standard stuff.  (Unless you count Buckleys gelato as exciting...)

I won't be back any time soon unless a tourist drags me here.

This might be my longest review yet!  I originally hit the word limit before getting to the food portion and had to edit out the long parts about the adventures just getting to the restaurant.  I'll save that for my autobiography."}
{"text":"Extremely terrible. Never ever come or recommend again. Most importantly, the food is not fresh at all. For the appetizer, i ordered smoked salmon, which is taken from freezer, not freshly made at all. The main- Pork! Pork! Pork!, one of the pork is smelly. It is very terrible and disappointed for me when eating. Besides, the rib eye costs me $85, which should be 16oz. However, it might be only 8oz or even less. We used to enjoy 8 oz beef in restaurant very often, and we are familiar with what an 8 oz beef should look like. I added two pictures to compare the size and weight, one is \"16\" oz and one is 8 oz (the last picture). Laatly, the price is wrong for us. It should be $58 for a two course but when we are paying the bill, it is $65 (which should be the price for dinner). But the waiter changed back to $58 after I complained. 
Overall, not a good meal at all."}
{"text":"Vivek quipped that \"The 360 has the atmosphere of an upscale chain steakhouse.\"

I've actually decided to not review this restaurant simply because of that one statement.  It was spot on and summed up a 1000 words which I could have used to describe the place, but I've decided to check the box after all 8 months later.  

So uhh...the 360 kinda feels like a steakhouse I've been to before...dammit no!

Okay...feel like an upscale chain....UGH!
-------------------------------------------------------
My first visit here was in 2007 after being given the position of impresario of a friend's birthday dinner.  I was younger of course, which meant this place held much more novelty in 2007, it was true what they say, and they say that it houses the world's tallest wine cellar.  Well, more like the wine cellar at the highest altitude, but this is no longer so as I'm sure that said title belongs to the Armani Hotel at Burj Khalifa, Dubai.  But their website's claim remains unchanged, who knows.
It was a very successful evening which a couple of my very refined friends was given unprecedented insight to how kitsch I can be with my wine selection and behaviour.  It's something with the altitude, I'm just a different drunk in the sky..
That time we had a waiter who was just amazingly knowledgeable about the food, a totally pleasant snob who placed the wrong dessert in front of me, then decided it was 'on the house' rather than taking it away.  I really liked that guy.
I ordered a bottle of 1991 Bourdeaux for $70.  $70!!!!!  I felt like I should have worn a tube sock on my head because that was the biggest robbery I have ever committed in my life!  And the wine was insanely good!  

Then, it was another two years until my next visit, during the whole economic meltdown where I discovered that the wait staff here was replaced by a team of service people of...well, another specific ethnicity.  That's the most I will say.
I ordered two dishes, and none of the waiters were able to tell me what I was eating.  My waiter actually went to the chef where he brought out a black & white print food description of my meal and handed to me to read.  I was embarrassed for causing this scene, it was just horrendous.  

Over the years I've been here a couple of times, always for dinner so I could never fully appreciate the view it offered.  Everytime the rotating floor faced the lake there would just be this huge patch of darkness which secretly made me nervous.  You can't book the window wide seat because it was given out randomly to people who showed up.  It can get annoying because the floor did rotate, which meant the washroom is changing locations all the time.  I can never figure out which way to walk was closer in this saucer! 
You NEED a reservation.  Let me say that again; You NEED a reservation to come here.  You cannot walk in and expect a table.  So if you're a terrorist...you must have polite telephone manners in order to honour Allah and retrieve your 70 virgins.  

The wine selection is decent, it really is, and can only be seconded by the likes of OPUS or Barberians.  I still can't believe I got a bottle of '91 Bourdeaux for only $70.  I shall forever rejoice on this.
As to whether if there is outdoor seating which is always asked in the Yelp survey, why the hell would you want outdoor seating HERE?

Too bad it just feels a lot like a chained steakhouse........AW CRAP!"}
{"text":"Made reservations on OpenTable.com. Came on a Sunday lunch where the line to get into the tower was extra long (outside and inside!) The meal reservations come with the benefit of skipping the long line and having access to a private elevator. Fantastic views await and although we had low expectations of the food, we enjoyed our prix fixe $58 salmon dish paired with dark chocolate lava cake. My sister found the prime rib (+$10) bland and tasteless - she had to ask for HP Sauce to make it better.  One in our party picked the squid appetizer and regretted it because of the slimy fishy taste and smell. Lunch comes with comp bread too. 

The place itself needs more organization and friendly ushers. it was a bit chaotic shuffling from the revolving restaurant to the glass floor to a non-revolving viewing deck . 

It's a nice pricey treat for a first timer in Toronto or maybe someone who wants to impress on the 3rd date. However if you've been to the same kind of resto in Atlanta or Chicago, you can skip this altogether as it is more of the same..."}
{"text":"Best view in Toronto. Cannot beat the view rotate around the city 360 degrees. This is great place to have dinner and enjoy the spectacular view. 

I would said the lunch prix fixe menu with three course hold the best value. Although the web indicate $$$$ for the meal. But it include the ride to the top of the tower. The ride along is $C44. The prix fixe lunch is $C65. Go figure. Just have a good lunch and enjoy the view. 

The chef has good skill. It is more into French cuisine. The prix fixe change time to time, please check their website. The tree courses meal include appetizer with three item combination. It is very creative. The main entrée I have the duck. It was nice and juicy. The final course is the white chocolate mousse tower. 

The service is great in the restaurant. The restaurant is slowly rotate and you can enjoy the view. Some may feel motion sickness but this can be taking care by have that person seating face the direction of the rotation."}
{"text":"This was everything I had hoped for and more.  We had made reservations for a 1:30 lunch on line several days prior.  We arrived at the CN tower at 1:00, but with our restaurant reservation, were directed to the elevator where we were put in a separate line that allowed us on the next available elevator.  We arrived at the restaurant a few minutes after 1:00 and were immediately seated.  Our served was especially friendly and helpful with the menu, wine selection and identifying buildings and sights.  The view and the food were spectacular.  The salmon tasted fresh and was cooked to perfection.  My wife thorowly enjoyed her scallops. All in all...a fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for dinner well in advance of our trip to Toronto so that we could dine at the right time to enjoy the view and sunset. We also requested and got a table by the window without any problem, which was great. We throughly enjoyed the quiet atmosphere and gorgeous views throughout our meal. 

When we arrived, it took several minutes to get through security. I recommend arriving 15 to 20 minutes early for your reservation to accommodate this. You have to walk through machines that blow air on you, which might be the weirdest security measure I have ever encountered. It wasn't painful though so if it makes my dining experience safer I'm OK with that. 

For dinner my husband and I chose to order from the two course prix fixe menu. We enjoyed both courses which included a salad, sausage, beef tenderloin, and the boneless half chicken. Everything was well cooked and really delicious. 

After dinner we also had the opportunity to visit the lookout and glass bottom floor levels for more views. 

All in all, we had a great visit and highly recommend it if you are visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"Breathtaking view and experience with mediocre food.  I had higher hopes for this place,  but they were dashed after I ordered the rabbit which was too gamy. The pork tenderloin was delicious.  The drinks,  ok. The desserts,  just ok. The lavender lemon tart was a bit above average.  I just couldn't get over the gamy taste of the rabbit and I could not complete my meal. That was 43 dollars down the drain.  But despite my disappointment in the food, it was an experience I enjoyed."}
{"text":"Oh my what a difference a year makes.  Last year our meals were delicious and the view so worth it.  Tonight not so much.   My one son could not eat his prime rib dinner ($75) because he thought the taste was \"off\" and my other son could not cut his with a knife as it was not tender.  I had the taste of Fogo Islands($65} and and it was awful.  I wish I had taken a picture of the (2) two inch by two inch pieces of cod and the few shrimp that were  baby shrimp  and the three \"snow crab legs\" were the size of tweezers.  I am not joking and  they were served all in a disgusting coconut foam.  Service was horrible with not drink refills offered (at $3.25 a soft drink)  and to top it off my pet peeve - getting a bill for  over $300 and the recommended tips included TAX!  On  $300 at  20 percent of $39 tax that 
 is an extra $7.80  you are tipping on the tax if you are not paying attention!  Beware of the tipping scam."}
{"text":"Was here on Friday, May 23, 2014. My boyfriend and I went for our anniversary. We both had an absolutely wonderful experience. We both got the prix-fixe four course dinner. We were seated right away at a table by the window. 
Food: 
The amuse bouche was wonderful, grilled pineapple with goat cheese crumble and pistachios. Had a slightly spicy flavour which nicely offset the sweetness. My mouth was very amused! 
The appetizer was smoked salmon with cucumber salad and capers which was very nice (even though I don't like capers). Very beautifully presented
The 10oz striploin was cooked to perfectly medium-rare, very flavourful. Came with mashed potatoes and greenbeans which were both very flavourful and cooked well.
The desert was the real show-stopper. Chocolate three ways. My favourite was the chocolate ganache raspberry tart and my boyfriend loved the orange chocolate cannoli but both were absolutely delicious.   
Service: 
Our waiter was the right amount of attentive, took care of us well without bugging us too often. If anything to complain about was the pace of the courses was a little too quick. A break in between would have been welcome to enjoy the view, company and ambiance. 
Ambiance:
Of course the view is amazing. We went at 6pm and got to enjoy the setting sun through dinner. I'm very sensitive to motion but had no problems at all because it rotates so slowly and smoothly. 
Overall:
The food was excellent, the experience was lovely. Yeah, no huge portions but that's not why you come here. Yeah, maybe a little pricier than other restaurants but the view and amazing food are definitely worth it. With both our dinners and a glass of wine each (amazing selection btw) and tip, a little over $220 which when you factor in the elevation cost is probably what we would spend at any other nice restaurant. We've decided to make this an annual thing for our anniversary. Take your out of town friends, take your dates, take your nana."}
{"text":"When you first walk in to the CN Tower, and you have made reservations,  you can bypass the lines and enter into the tower by going through a concierge area to the right of the ticket purchase kiosks in the lobby.  After this, you are directed down the hall and around a corner where you would be greeted by very friendly staff.   The staff members then confirm your reservation and give you a piece of paper (pass). After this, you are directed down the hall to a waiting area where you wait for the elevator to arrive.  An attendant  verifies your pass so that you may go on an elevator and up to the restaurant for reservation. 

Once you're up on the floor, you show your paper slip  at the entryway of the restaurant again, your reservation is confirmed. Once it is confirmed, you are directed by a waitstaff to a table. We were lucky that it wasn't super busy when we went. I recommend getting there about 15 to 20 minutes prior to the reservations so that you have time to wait if there is a lineup to get onto the elevator to meet your reservations.  

The staff from the greeters all the way to the restaurant are very friendly.

The food itself and the menu probably change based on seasonal preferences but I found the menu to be good. I liked the fact that the restaurant used local or Canadian-based ingredients. Being from the metro Detroit/Windsor area, it was nice to see that part of their salads had Leamington Roma tomatoes. That's pretty local from my neck of the woods.  The options at the restaurant include various food options that are also vegetarian friendly which is very important to me. 

At the restaurant, you may order à la carte or, you can do a two course or three course meal. We were able to schedule our reservations online and were able to specify seating. Any seat in this restaurant has an amazing view as the floor is revolving.  Although not all the tables are along the window, I would recommend if you have the ability to request a table by the window, do it.  In my opinion,  a seat by the window is better than some of the seating that is a little bit further away from the window (although you still have a view) 

We had a great experience in the food was fresh it was beautifully presented and it was full of flavours. The desserts at the restaurant were mediocre l, but the presentation is beautiful."}
{"text":"The view was amazing, the food presentation was good, but server made our experience bad by basically rushing us from start to finish. I told her to give us some time and she kept coming over asking if we are ready yet. Also, when she gave us the bill, she kept looking over us to see if we have paid yet. It's very annoying. The bus boy was much nicer than our server! He should get tipped. Plus, the prime rib I ordered was overcooked. I asked for medium well, it came out super well done. Dry and hard to chew. It was a big disappointment. Also, the bread was cold and the seafood platter was almost frozen. I think if we had a better server this experience would have been a lot better. I say skip this and go eat at Skylon tower."}
{"text":"You will see lots of 2 star and 5 star review for this place. When you factor in a lift ticket normally costs 35 bucks and 3 course meal cost 80. 45 dollars for a full dinner is a steal. The food was high quality(slightly on the small side but still filling). The waiter was very attentive and engaged with us. If you took that restaurant and placed it on the ground and still charged 80, I would still give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch while on a family vacation.
I really enjoyed dining here. There is a pre-fixed menu with good options for appetizers, main course, and dessert to choose from. 

It was such a nice day and the view of the city was beautiful. The restaurant doesn't spin fast at all so you barely even notice that you're moving when eating. 

As someone coming to visit Toronto for the first time, I would definitely recommend making a trip to eat here."}
{"text":"So this was the second time I had been to 360. I mean, we all go for the atmosphere and view which makes the trip up high worth it and the prices too. Luckily, this time around they had a prix fixe menu. I chose the $75 option. VERY good choice. Stick to the seafood, it is very good. I had tuna, duck and a fish fillet, wonderful. The dessert was a dark chocolate tower and it was so yummy. The only things I was underwhelmed by was: 1) the servers have no personality. (or at least mine didn't) He did his job correctly and was fast and efficient, but it was like we were almost on a rotation? Speak to us as much as necessary, get us out as quickly as possible to get a next seating. Maybe it was unintentional, but it definitely felt like that. And 2) cold bread. I was really disappointed at that. They bring out a small basket of bread and you're excited because you love the smell of fresh bread and putting some butter on it, but, it was cold. Completely unappetizing. I don't know if it was a mistake or if it is always like this, but, no one likes putting butter on cold bread - especially at a fancy place like 360."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is HORRIBLE. Bad service, expensive prices, mediocre food. I'm not sure if it was because we had a party of 8, and gratuity is automatically added to the bill, but the server did not seem to really care about us. My dad, previously being a waiter of fine dining, automatically noticed the unprofessionalism of our waiter. I guess the view of Toronto is suppose to distract customers from noticing how horrible they are. 

We ordered two seafood samplers for the 2 tables (split with 4 people each to see the view) at $40/each, which consisted of 3 jumbo shrimp, 2 crab claws, 4 oysters (not fresh), 6 mussels, and some miscellaneous odds and ends in the middle with chopped pepper, small shrimp, onions. The jumbo shrimp was good, but how could you go wrong with shrimp cocktail. 

I asked the server to provide some of his recommendations, and he basically listed the entire list of entrees. Very unhelpful. After we placed our order, I expected bread to come, esecially at a fancy restaurant such as this. I spoke with one of the helpers of the servers, who told me that bread is only presented upon request. Now, REALLY?! So after about 15 mins of forgetting about me, I gave him an eye as he walked by the table, to let him know that we wanted bread. He only gave one of the two tables a basket of bread, and I had to ask again for another basket. I was getting annoyed at this point.

 I ordered the salmon, which didn't have much taste. The other people at my side of the table had the chicken, sirloin steak, and lamb. They all had to add some salt and pepper to give it some taste. They weren't too impressed with their meals either. We skipped on dessert.

The ONLY plus about dining at the 360 is that if you make reservations, you get to skip the line to the top of the CN Tower. You also get FREE access to the Observation Tower and Glass Floor in which is one and two floors below the restaurant. You do however, have to wait in line to go back down the CN Tower. So if you were interested in seeing the CN Tower, dining at the 360 may be your best bet to cut lines, and the view is included in the meal, which may be why dining there is so costly. The entire bill for 8 people for 2 appetizers and 8 entrees came to $491. Tax in Canada is 14% (cost of free healthcare). Together with Grauity added almost $120 to the bill for CRAP service."}
{"text":"A great place to go to if you want to impress someone who may not really be a foodie.

Took my mother here and some family not from Toronto who rarely go out to eat. They really enjoyed the food and wine but the rest of us who live in downtown Toronto and have access to some of Toronto's best weren't quite impressed.

I had the Veal Osso Bucco with Quebec Foie Gras. The veal was slightly tough and chewy and I felt the Foie Gras could've been better as well. 

I feel the price is really more so for the stunning view of Toronto and getting to experience the glass floor and observation deck.

The service is excellent. Everyone very friendly and accomodating, made my family feel very welcome.

Definitely worth visiting at least once for the view alone, but if you're looking for serious eats you might want to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Compare with the ticket for CN tower and the waiting line for that, it's really a smart idea to pay some extra $ to have a lunch in 360 Restaurant. The food and the view there worth every penny I paid. It's a great experience, I'll totally recommend it to anyone who hasn't been to the tower."}
{"text":"Fantastic views! Great prefix and make sure to make a reservation before hand! It is a must experience if you are visiting Toronto. We had the best experience and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Worth at least one visit! I can't name a restaurant with better ambiance- you get to dine here on tasty food while enjoying a breathtaking panoramic view of the city- all 360, because you're rotating! Memories of eating here with my family will last a long time.

My family came here for dinner and we ordered from the fixed menus. I got the $55 meal. The food was simple, flavourful, and satisfying. The ingredients were fresh and the veggies were tender. My Sea Salt Crusted Salmon with Fried capers came with asparagus, which I normally HATE, but I could not stop commenting on how good the asparagus was to my surprise. The salad was good as well.
I'm not much of a sweet tooth, and I was stuffed after the main course, so the dessert (dark chocolate tower with summer berries) was not memorable... but it was still pretty good.
Portion sizes are quite large. I wish I could have gotten the kids sized version my little sister ordered (but I'm too old :( )
That said, I can't say the food was the best I enjoyed. Especially not for that price. But it was very good food... and a wonderful atmosphere. I enjoyed my evening thoroughly and I have to say the price was worth it-- for the experience, if not for the food."}
{"text":"Outstanding Food, but the service is more like a chain restaurant, the view is perfect and i think with that kind of food, the perfect view and good service it would be just the greatest restaurant experience !!! #WeddingAnniversary"}
{"text":"It was my second time dining at this restaurant. My boyfriend and I were seated by the window so we got a spectacular view of the city. We ordered the seafood platter and tenderloin to share. Both dishes were delicious. The service was great and attentive.  It was overall a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"If you have time and money, this is definitely a place to be. The dishes were fairly small, but all delicious. The lunch menu was very filling and $60 per person for two courses, $74 for all three courses. My green salad appetizer was okay, just overdressed. My main course, however, was incredible! I got the lentil and barley fritters, which had the texture of a falafel, and came with kimchi and a really great sauce. I give that a 10/10. For dessert, my mom and I shared a lemon tart and it was so tasty. Not too sour, not too sweet, and the marshmallow balanced everything out very well. Not to mention, the views from the tower were incredible. Definitely glad we went."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is amazing. I came all the way to Toronto from New York City for an Anniversary dinner that I will NEVER forget. Upon entering the restaurant, the hostess was very nice and polite. I arrived early at the restaurant, as instructed, and although I was 30 minutes early, my table was still ready for me. Once seated at the table, our waiter was awesome. He was a real people's person, and you could tell that he loved his job. Now when it came to the food, it was phenomenal! I had the prime rib with the pairing wine, and my date had the salmon. The food was really something to remember. By the time we finished, we were too full for desert. After dinner, you are welcomed to go and look at the view on the lower floors. I literally don't have one complaint about my experience. The service was amazing, the restaurant was beautiful, the view was outstanding, and the food was phenomenal. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone that is in town or out of town, and if I ever come back to Toronto, I will definitely take a trip because here. If I could give this place 10 stars I would!"}
{"text":"View was spectacular, food is very average almost a mediocre not worth of the price & services does not meet my expectations."}
{"text":"It's overpriced, but the views are incredible and make it definitely worth it. 

Hit and miss dishes, but the hits at our table were definitely the short ribs and the chocolate lava cake. Had a really lovely lunch!"}
{"text":"Let's start with pros:  beautiful place, attentive servers, spectacular view of entire city.
Now the cons:  where do I start?  I do not feed that food even to my dog.  I am not sure all the people who give high marks regarding food are comparing the food with.  The prime rib was 75% fat.  Another prime rib was so dry that the waitress voluntarily changed it.  But the quality of meat was the type one should grind for dog food.  The Salmon was so dry you could have broken someone's head with it.  The beans were totally raw and was not even eatable.  Salads while semi- good, were such a small portion, it was a teaser than a course!  
Basically enjoy the view.  I was very disappointed and certainly not recommend the place for food unless you just are willing to pay the price for the view as I would not buy their food at any price ( or even free)."}
{"text":"I have been in Canada over 4 yrs and this is my third time in CN tower.But this is my first time in 360 restaurant. It was a very good experience. Every dish is so delicate and waiter was so patient for recommendation,introduction,service and take photo for us. Nice 360 view all over Toronto was very impressive. Food are good and for sure expensive. 3 course set for 2 people with another 2 drinks will be around $240. But the view worth everything.     
Oh,remenber u need to make reservation at leat 3 weeks ahead,otherwise u won't able to book the 6-8pm reservation cuz it's way too popular."}
{"text":"The views are breathtaking and the food was equally delicious. I didn't get a chance to go out on the observation deck to view the city through the glass floor this time, but it will be on the list for the next trip!"}
{"text":"Good value if you want to check out the CN tower - but a mediocre meal regardless.

I honestly do not know how this restaurant claims to have won culinary awards. For quality of food, considering view and price point, it really can't hold a candle to Canoe. I had the salmon, which was passable, and my friend had the steak, which was fairly bland with an unfavourable texture. We also shared a completely unmemorable chocolate tower dessert, which looked much more impressive than it tasted. The wine was good enough, but that's fairly irrelevant to the kitchen.

HOWEVER, if you intend to go up the CN tower anyway it's surprisingly good value (-$30 each from your meal if you consider the cost of going into the CN tower), and is worth your while for the experience itself. 

Overall, I'm not particularly compelled to return, except perhaps with a tourist friend who wants to check out the CN tower."}
{"text":"Steaks were cooked appropriately. The side dishes are definitely big enough to share between 2-3 people"}
{"text":"Service was alright. Food was alright. View was amazing. Don't know why people have to dress so fancy to dine in this restaurant. Not having to wait the long line up to go up the tower was great because you have a reservation to dine here. Overall decent. This is a spot just for an amazing view of the 6ix."}
{"text":"The view is probably still worth going to this restaurant. Service is wonderful but the food is only average. It is typical of a place that depends so much on tourists so I should have expected it. The food is very overpriced for the quality. I would suggest going up for viewing but choosing somewhere else to eat"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit here, but this place is way overpriced for the quality of food they serve. I know that part of the price is the view and the experience, and I'm ok with that. But I paid $80 for a ribeye steak that had the quality of a $20 cut of meat. (Plus, I had to send it back because my medium steak came out on the rare side of medium rare).

I ordered a baked potato as a side dish, and they brought me two. That was weird. I noticed that the menu suggested two side dishes for each entree (and I can see why at those prices).  I think because I only ordered one, they forced me to buy two. 

The waiter was very good and very attentive. Our drinks were always full.   All in all, we had an enjoyable time, but I wouldn't go back unless the food quality improved or the price dropped to match the quality."}
{"text":"A must experience for visitors and locals. Of course, it is not the cheapest, but I challenge you to find a place with such an amazing view and tasty, fine food where you'd spend less.
We made a reservation a week prior to our dinner, however walk-ins seemed to be very welcomed as well (we did go on a Thursday night though). My girlfriend and I were seated by the window, as she asked when reserved. Needless to say, best seats in the house. We had the chance to overlook the entirety of the city lit up for the night while we dined and enjoyed nice conversation, surprisingly since the restaurant was pretty packed.
Now, the part everyone wants to read about: the food. Well, we liked it a lot. It was not mind-blowingly delicious, but it was definitely of great quality and flavor. We had the tuna and the celery and fennel bisque as appetizers. The tuna was really good, however nothing special. The bisque was both of our favorites. It was soooo velvety and the flavors were delicate but so balanced not to result blend. 
For entree we had the salmon and the duck breast. Both were amazing. The salmon melted in our mouths and the duck paired wonderfully with the accompanying sides of mashed potatoes, cranberries and sautéed greens. We definitely recommend both dishes if ordering from the fixed price menu.
Their selection of wines is astonishing, so we both ordered the suggested pairings. As Italians, we must admit our first Ontario-wines experience went really well, as both wines did perfectly pair with the meals and were rich but delicate at the same time.
To top it off, we ordered the chocolate tart. Loved, loved, loved the meringue. It perfectly accompanied the combination of chocolate and orange that filled the tart.
Of course, we did pay quite a lot for such a big meal, but we received complimentary entrance to the tower, which saved us more than $40, and the experience of eating at such elevation was definitely worth the price. True, maybe the quality of the food can be replicated in a slightly cheaper restaurant somewhere else, but in the end you pay for the experience and the view. It is not a meal you'd go back for every month, but we definitely recommend it for very special occasions where a unique atmosphere is needed."}
{"text":"Options are limited for vegetarians. The food is not great either. But the city looked beautiful from the top - the view made up for the food!"}
{"text":"Wonderful 3 course meal, starting with a nice New Zealand red wine, moving to the smoked salmon, the rabbit for dinner and the pecan tart for dessert. Each course was bursting with flavor and appeal, the rabbit being my favorite with its wide noodles, mushroom based sauce and lovely seasoning. You can't beat the view, seriously the best seat in town, though the prices are steep. 

My colleague had the shrimp cocktail, more like super jumbo shrimp cocktail, and the steak with green beans along with the vanilla ice cream for dessert. He enjoyed every bite though he thought the shrimp to be quite ridiculous in size and a bit much for an app. 

Five stars, great service, helpful and friendly staff. We had Billy :)."}
{"text":"Beautiful view and not a bad seat in the restaurant. There are plenty of food options and the waiter was very good with recommendations. The food was delicious as to be expected. 

Expect to stay about an hour because they want you to have a chance to see all the way around the city.  
But they will rush the order of you request so. 

I was sensitive to the movement at first. I thought it would be nice to sit close to the window but on the contrary. But when I switched seats with my husband I was able to enjoy the view a lot more."}
{"text":"View was good. Food was good but not exceptional. The duck salad left me very good impression though. However waiter was hard to call and service was slow and poor, with very close tables and seats which are hard to move on the carpet, it was very uncomfortable sitting there to eat. The wine collection was good I think? I don't know much about wine but everyone likes the wine we ordered. We went for dinner and it was very noisy."}
{"text":"Don't bother with the tour ticket - go to 360 instead!

Had a great meal at 360 and an amazing view of Toronto. The food was all very good - seafood, drinks, and of course the long bone pork chop! Very nice presentation. 

Yes it's pricey but you get a a great meal which includes access to the observation deck and time to sit an enjoy the rotation. The service was a bit lacking - they didn't even explain the menu or try to offer anything in particular."}
{"text":"View was excellent as expected.  Food was better than expected based on some of the reviews, everything was delicious.  Price was as expected, as it's a tourist destination.  Service was OK, fine at first but a bit slow at the end  as several large groups were seated nearby.  Recommended if you can afford it."}
{"text":"General admission to CN tower = $36, HUGE WAIT LINE for elevator to go up

Price to eat at 360 = $58 (lunch), $65 (dinner) - so you spend $22-$29 for a gourmet meal, get access to the levels of the tower included in the general admission and most importantly go up the tower in your own elevator and DON'T WAIT IN LINE (or a very short line)

So for folks going to the CN tower for the first time, I definitely consider making reservations at the 360 instead of just buying CN tower tickets.

The 360 restaurant service has definitely improved from the last time I was there. Reserving window seating previously was a big headache. Now, you request it upon arrival and if nothing is available you wait for next open table while touring the other floors of the tower. It's such an efficient system.

Food has vastly improved, service is friendlier, views are unbeatable especially on a sunny, clear, summer day.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had lunch at this 360 restaurant on a last second whim without knowing anything about it. 

- Service here was good. Kind of cool being escorted up in the elevators by other staff members (your ears will pop, but it doesn't last long). 

-Food here was delicious. For dessert, Get the chocolate tower. Om-nom.

- Great view and quiet atmosphere - Perhaps a little too quiet in the day time. But that might change at night. 

Honestly you're paying for the experience. Like any other fancy outing, remember it's okay to treat yourself once and awhile :)

Afterwords, you get a free tour of the observation deck and glass floor. Makes the experience that much more enjoyable.

I would visit the 360 restaurant again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. I have to just say I found it to be OK. You ride to the restaurant on a glass elevator Willy Wonka style (although this glass elevator does stop at the right floor) and are greeted by a breathtaking view (assuming there isn't any fog/too many clouds, which it was clear when I was there last night). You then work your way around the curves to your seating destination, which thankfully is marked with a number on the stairway or a trip to the bathroom could mean having a real hard time finding your party again. The menu is rather limited and pricey. I ordered a steak at the recommendation of our server...it was overcooked and just OK. My dining pals ordered chicken and fish and also had the same reaction. My culinary highlight was the bread... I have to say the view was gorgeous and you certainly will get to see everything as it moves at a reasonable pace. What would have made that experience better is a guide for what I was seeing - not being at all familiar with the Toronto skyline/area, it would have been great to have some highlights/must sees pointed out to me. When you finish eating, if you want to also access the additional viewing levels, you walk down what almost feels like a staircase that will take you out to a seedy bar. While the view is still spectacular, it's not the same as when you have less people in the revolving floor above. The food wasn't worth it, but getting the revolving view was...and if buying an entree was your ticket to entry for that, so be it...I just wish places like this would think a little more about the food and service a little more..."}
{"text":"The best eating experience I've ever had thus far. It's not just the food (which was incredible) but the view and the atmosphere was like nothing I've experienced. If you go for dinner, I'm 100% sure you'll enjoy it. I felt like a don, watching over my city #viewsfromthe6ix"}
{"text":"This was totally worth the money! We did the 2 course lunch at it was $58 which is not bad considering it includes the cost of getting to the glass floor after your meal. Our food and drinks were delicious! Very elegant presentation and menu options. We received excellent service, and rotating in the restaurant is something everyone should experience if they can! We went with a baby and I was a bit worried about disrupting other people if the baby cried so we opted for lunch instead of dinner and I was glad we did. We were celebrating my mom's birthday which I had mentioned in our reservation and they remembered and gave a free dessert with a candle in it that said happy Birthday on it. I was very happy they did this because we were celebrating a birthday away from home and I was worried how I would get my mom a cake with a candle! :)"}
{"text":"Food was average and it was extremely cold in the restaurant. I ate my food with my coat on... I asked three times if they could make it warmer and I was told there was nothing they could do."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I did not foot the bill for our dining experience, or even part of it, but I did see the total ($500+ for our party of 5), and I can understand why people think it is grossly over-priced. 

I'm on the fence about it, and I will go right out and admit that's because I didn't have to pay $500 for it. If I did, well, no, let's not even think about that!

I'm a local of three years, having married a local, but have never been to the CN tower.  But everyone in our party had been several times, so the consensus is to go in the early evening so you can see everything in daylight, and then watch the sunset, and leave after dark. I think that seeing the city lights at night was absolutely an incredible experience and I wouldn't trade it for only the daylight! But a mix of daylight, sunset, and night lights- I just might! 

We made reservations (they are necessary) and requested a table by the window (recommended!) and boy was the experience incredible. Several times our table was just quiet as we watched the lights outside, because the entire restaurant rotates slowly so that you can get a full view of the city while you dine. 

Most of the complaints in previous reviews were about the wait times and lines, but we didn't have any of that at either the restaurant or the tower itself (and we were there at dinner time, 6-9!), so I can't comment. In fact, the observation deck was completely empty when we went down after dinner. 

And now for the food! I quite enjoyed my meal, but I know that other party members found it just \"okay\".  What I did like was that they provide a completely separate vegetarian menu with easily made vegan items, so we had no headaches about ordering. 

I really enjoyed myself, and as long as you don't go overboard on appetizers and desserts and drinks- the prices are okay (at least for vegetarians!).  I certainly wouldn't mind coming again for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Having never been to Canada or Toronto, I knew I couldn't leave without getting one of THE best views of such a beautiful city. The food wasn't spectacular, but paying $35 more dollars to get the view and a meal was well worth it to me. 

Just a few tips - 

- When making reservations, ask for a window seat, or you could end up towards the middle of one side. 
- Check the weather forecast. if it's cloudy you probably won't see much
- Best time I think is sunset. It is absolutely gorgeous

To go up the needle and see the view is about $30...add another $35 and you can order off the Prixe Fix menu and eat a good meal. I tried the charcuterie appetizer, Prime Rib with roasted veggies and a potato gratin for my main course and the lemon raspberry dessert. The charcuterie came with meat and cheeses and was really delicious. The Prime Rib was good and served Medium rare, honestly I didn't care for the potatoes. The lemon raspberry dessert was so delicious, but the chocolate tower looked amazing! I had a nice glass of Malbec to wash everything down. Of course you're going to pay more to eat here then most restaurants, but coupled with the view, it's a place to go for a nice occasion or to celebrate a special event. The restaurant rotates all the way around in a little over an hour, but the views are simply amazing. Included in your meal price too, is the chance to go to the glass floor and to walk on the sky deck. Overall I had a great experience and it was the perfect ending to my first trip to Canada!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to go to this restaurant and was so DISAPPOINTED with the FOOD. We ordered the prime rib which had a FOWL taste.  As a culinary school graduate, we were taught  you should always taste what you are serving. THIS WAS NOT DONE. Our server could  have  cared less and acted like he wish he was somewhere else. 
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT.  Till the Quality of the  food improves, 
we went 12/4/2016. oh the view is awesome."}
{"text":"PROS: The view is stunning! The restaurant is 115 stories high, and the restaurant revolves so that you can see all of beautiful Toronto. It moves very slow (probably took an hour to do a full rotation) so you will not feel queasy during your meal. Very comfortable seating area as well. It's a upscale setting, so it's a good place to dress up and go to for an anniversary, date, birthday, etc. 

CONS: The service was a bit of a let down. Our server seemed like he didn't want to be at work, or to be serving us. He seemed almost annoyed when he was taking our order. Which seemed odd since we weren't asking all sorts of questions or being high maintenance. And after the dinner we had, I thought it was all overpriced. The prime rib was massive, but not as tasty as other prime ribs that I've had. The salmon and scallops dish was a good size but my friend said it wasn't the best she's had. We had tuna & shrimp cocktail for appetizers - nothing special. And the desserts weren't super impressive either. The side dishes were yummy at least (we got the mushrooms and french fries with truffle aioli). Other than that, the quality of the food was not great. Pretty bland to sum it up. So overall, I felt like we paid A LOT for food that was \"meh, it was okay.\" I expected a lot more since this is an upscale restaurant. 

The only way I would come back is for the views."}
{"text":"To avoid the crowds, we made a reservation on a weekday and for lunch.  Dinner is always cool, but personally I'd rather be able to see everything during the day versus seeing the night time lights.  But that's just me!

As the elevator doors opened, we checked in with our welcoming hostess, and were seated in an inner dining booth.  If we wanted an outer table along the glass window, it would've been another 45 minute wait.  Eh, didn't bother.  Just being up there is grossly romantic enough.    

We were greeted by the water waiter whom filled our glasses.  Then were greeted by our actual waitress Sandra.  We were starving, but she knew the menu and made some excellent recommendations.  

You can start by doing either a regular meal with sides, or with their Prix Fixe menu:
2 course $58
3 course $72

We did a 3 course, and tried:
~ (plate #1) Organic Ocean BC Humboldt Squid which was on a baguette toast, with avocado, sea salt, lime, and soft chopped up squid.  Mmm mmm, what a way to start!  That squid with the avocado was simply appetizing.  
~ (plate #2) Crispy Perth County Pork Belly and Seared East Coast Sea Scallops, and my oh my!  The sea scallops were \"perfectly\" cooked, and for them to be topped with King Salmon caviar.  BOOM!  Instant explosion of flavor in your mouth!  Memorable!  As for the pork belly, it too was cooked to perfection!  Tender inside and easily breakable with a fork.  You gotta try this dish!
~ (plate #3) Ice cream and cookies, that being a scoop of Lindt milk chocolate and salted caramel ice cream.  Joined by a shortbread friend, and a pistachio biscotti.  This ice cream was so damn smooth, and not overly sweet.  What a great choice for dessert!  

There were so many good choices on the menu, but I decided on the Perth County Smoked Pork Rack Chop (16oz @ $65cad) which came with a summer fruit Mostarda.  A sweet tasting little compliment to the chop.  Kind of like a guava jelly topping that I really enjoyed!  And also included was a Niagara apple and peach cider jus.  Awww man, what a savory salty sweet combo!  As for the thick arse chop itself, DAMN!  The rub they put on it seared into the fat was just heaven!  

Now, at first they came out with a \"well-done\" chop, even though I had ordered it medium-rare.  I didn't complain, nor did I say much, but I showed it to Sandra and she immediately took it back and got me a new piece.  And honestly, I'm not sure which one I liked better.  The well-done chop, or the pinky center chop.  But thanks to Sandra, she fixed the problem right away.  The manager even gave us a complimentary lava cake.  How nice!  I mean, if anything, it was my birthday.  

Sides ($11cad each), we had the:  
~ Butter and Chive Mashed Potatoes - Real potatoes, DELECTABLE!
~ Sautéed Foraged Mushrooms with Thyme - Luscious!  

Coffee!  They've got special coffees ($9.85cad)
~ Monte Cristo Coffee with Grand Marnier and Kahlúa, but I held off on the whipped cream.  Holy fook Batman!  Even this was enticing!  It's probably because of the Grand Marnier.  

Well, there you have it folks.  Pricey lunch, but I enjoyed every plate.  Would I come back here again?  I mean, yeah WHY NOT!  I'm paying for excellent food, the excellent 360 degree views, and without the sticky gross observation crowd."}
{"text":"I should've known. I am paying for the view and not the food, but I really did not expect the bad service and food we received.

There was not a single thing we ordered (between 2 appetizers, 3 entrees and 2 deserts) that tasted remotely nice. After a hefty $300 tag with tips, I would atleast expect immaculate service. The wait staff was in our face, cleared dishes without asking and literally took them from the other side of the table without so much as an excuse me. 

Take heed and eat at the small shops a few blocks away. Your wallet and palette with thank me"}
{"text":"Nothing beats this revolving view of the city. Food is decent, but nothing spectacular as for fine dining. You're paying for more than the food here. Service was better than I expected."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here tonight for my birthday dinner. The only reason I'm giving this restaurant 3 stars is for its amazing view. Although the food was quite delicious, I'm not so sure it was worth the $79. While the appetizer (niagara charcuterie) and main course (veal osso bucco w/ foie gras) were both amazing, the dessert (mocha mousse) was only aesthetically appetizing. 

What really killed this experience was our server's attitude. It seemed we were the youngest (read: youngest looking) diners at the time, and apparently, that was a problem for our server, Kelly. We didn't get an introduction to the restaurant, like other Yelpers said they received, we were not told about the 72min rotation (not that I cared, but it would have been a nice touch).  While he went around the area asking other diners how their meals were, we were ignored. 

When the meals came, nobody had bothered to explain what they were. The closest thing we got to an explanation was a runner who asked who was having the osso bucco. The meals were simply plonked down on the table. 

Now, I may be a huge stickler for service, but if we're paying $79 per meal, I would expect at least some kind of service. 

Overall, I was extremely disappointed, especially since I had been looking forward to this for quite some time now. If you're in the area, and have the money to spend, just take your business to Canoe."}
{"text":"I was very excited for my dinner here because of the beautiful view. The site itself isn't as high as other towers I've visited but it served a good purpose for the sites of Toronto. My boyfriend and I ordered a Grand Prix meal each and the simple word for our food was mediocre. The steak was full of fat, the cutlery wasn't sharp, and the dessert was much too sugary. I guess for the food and the tour of the building it was all worth it. We had a difficult time finding our way out. The elevators need to be accessed by an employee and we waited for quite a while. My experience overall was acceptable."}
{"text":"Come here for the experience, but don't expect much from the food.  My fiance and I came here to celebrate our anniversary and it did not meet my expectations. 

The concept of a rotating restaurant is neat, and in under 90 minutes you can see all of Toronto. The restaurant is clean, and the atmosphere is quiet. The patrons are a mix of tourist and those celebrating special occasions or anniversaries.  

We had the set lunch menu, I ordered the seared sea scallops with house cured pancetta as an appetizer. The scallops were delicious. Fresh and meaty, just melt in your mouth, perfect. If I were to do my rating on this plate alone it would be 5 stars. For my entree, I had the braised Canadian AAA beef short ribs, they were the worst short ribs I have ever had (including the time I accidentally set my slow cooker on high for 9 hours while I was at work...). The beef short rib was dry and stringy, my butter knife could not cut through it and there was not enough 'au jus\" to choke it down. The carrots were flavourless and I'll have nightmares of eating the sweet corn polenta. Do yourself a favour and DO NOT order this dish. It's shocking to me that it made it out of the kitchen. 

The view and the seared sea scallops was the only redeeming thing about the 360 Restaurant. The only time I saw our server smile was after my fiance paid the bill. if you want good food, I'd recommend another restaurant, but this place has the best view of Toronto in town (though if you're local, it might feel odd at first not seeing the CN Tower)."}
{"text":"Since we were planning on going up the CN tower anyways, we decided to take others suggestion to bypass the lines & get lunch at the CN tower which enabled us to go to the observation deck and glass floor (which is just a tiny section) level. We had made reservations and requested the seats right next to the window knowing that the restaurant layout was so that there are actually three rings that circle away from the windows. However, when we finally got to the restaurant about 15 before our reservations, we were told that that the window seats would not be available until 45 min later so they invited us to go check out the observatory level first. 

Little did I know at that point, I should have just left because the food was absolutely not worth waiting for. Even though it was fun to be in a rotating restaurant and the views were nice that afternoon, the novelty wore off as I became more fixated on the food. Each course was an utter disappointment. We opted for the 3-course pre-fixe for ~$65 per person. 

There were lots to choose from, and we tried the (hairy) duck platter three ways; (cold) arctic char; and duck sausage; chocolate lava (glacier) cake. The duck appetizer itself was quite delicious if you I ignore the hair on the platter. I loved the duck pate, and the 3 pieces of tiny toasted bread.  I went ahead and ordered the cod even though other reviewers had mentioned theirs had been super DRY and SALTY as if it was nuked in the microwave thinking that it could have been an anomaly. However, mine was also super dry and salty as well that I simply could not finish the two pieces of cod. It was definitely a major waste of food. Even though I wanted to tell our server, but she was nowhere to be found during our entree portion and then the busboys ended up taking it away. When I left I noticed a lot of food was put under a heat lamp, perhaps that is why the fish always taste so awfully overcooked? 

The duck sausage was fine. The chocolate lava cake was not hot at all, and as others mentioned, it might as well been named as a glacier cake in the menu. There was this weird glob of cream on the top of it that made the cake look not delectable. But who can say no to the chocolate portion?

Overall, pretty disappointing experience and I would suggest to others who are thinking of dining, is it worth $200~for a 60 hour novelty of being in a rotating restaurant or is the quality of the food more important? Hopefully 360 one day does improve the execution and quality of its food, because it's such a waste of experience to have a terrible meal in such a nice environment overlooking Toronto."}
{"text":"The view is undeniably great. Unfortunately, that's about all this place has going for it. It's not that the food is bad, it's just not worth the price we paid for it. I've had as good or better fare for 1/3 of the price I paid here. You do however get access to the lower levels which is a plus if you've never been to the CN tower (but once you've seen it, you've seen it). 

My experience wasn't helped by a server who cleaned our plates off the table and dropped a greasy fork on my back. He just picked up the fork and headed to the kitchen. No effort to clean the food off the back of my shirt (I had to ask another server for a napkin and he and my friends cleaned the food off, and apologized). Unfortunately we had another appointment after so I was forced to stop and buy a clean shirt after already paying an arm and a leg for mediocre food."}
{"text":"This place is getting 4 stars because of its view and service.
The waiter was amazing. Very sweet guy, didn't mind taking pictures for me and was very attentive:-)
However the food.... was ok and not worth the price to be honest. You are pretty much paying for the view, which is ok, but at the same time I wish the food was better.
Still, worth to go at least once."}
{"text":"I can't remember the view. That's how memorable my experience at 360 was, and don't even get me started on the food...

My point is: If you're going for the view, go! Take the ride up the CN Tower, up and down past the restaurant. Then, take the money you saved on a \"tourist meal\" and have a taste of Toronto that's worthy of your foreign coin without the hook-factor of the tower to draw in diners.

Explanation of two star rating: the service was decent, and i'm not neglecting that there IS a great view."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the food here, nothing outstanding but good quality. 

Service was slow but not horrendously so, about two hours in total for dinner. 

A bonus for all the cheapskates is the free admission to the tower outlooks, save yourself $23"}
{"text":"HAHA.... one of the grading points is \"Outdoor Seating\"?  Had to snicker!  Loved 360.  Food was great and ...what a VIEW!  Was slightly disappointed that they didn't have more veg/vegan options than just pasta and grilled veg since it is such an extraordinary location.   My better half loved his meal and mine was pretty good.  I have to say it was the best sorbet EVER!    Loved the view - we made reservations so that we timed it around sunset.  So beautiful.  Great for special occasions.  We have a rotating restaurant here in Phoenix but it doesn't compare!  P.S.  We went outside on the observation decks during March and I couldn't believe the COLD -  inappropriate words suddenly flew from my lips !  My better half laughed at this desert mouse (he is from north of Toronto)."}
{"text":"A great restaurant with obviously a great view. The oysters were great! We were able to update our reservation time twice without issues which was nice. 
Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Canada Day was my third anniversary with my boyfriend, so we reserved a table like half a year in advance (crazy I know--what if we split up? nah!) We used OpenTable to reserve the place, and got lots of notifications before the day of. It was pretty nice that they wouldn't notify me until the date got much closer, and they wanted to make sure that I remembered it. 

As we went towards the restaurant, we were asked if we wanted to take a picture. We complied and they told us that we would be able to see this online if we wanted to purchase it or something. Since it was a special day, why not?!

We took the elevator up with a bunch of other people. There were other couples, as well as some families. Everyone else seemed to be really rushed to get in front of each other. I didn't really mind, so I ended up entering the elevator after everyone else. Being in an elevator with loud families squawking at the city view feels a little weird. Since I was the last to enter the elevator, I happened to also be the first to exit the elevator and to enter the restaurant. 

When we got to the restaurant, we were literally a large crowd waiting for us to be seated. There was a mom who kept urging her 6-year-old to get ahead of me and get a waiter's attention. I thought that was a bit rude, but I let her anyway... maybe they were in a rush to eat? Dunno. Either way, the waiter decided to seat me first. Not really sure why. Maybe he liked how my boyfriend and I dressed patriotically (he happened to wear a white dress shirt and I wore a red dress on Canada Day). 

We were seated at the window, giving us a beautiful view of the city as we slowly rotated around. I had the lobster lasagna (enjoyed the clams, not the shrimp so much) and my boyfriend had the AAA Alberta steak (pretty good!). We also shared a clam chowder and enjoyed some Riesling. It was a bit pricey, but I really enjoyed the whole experience. The waiter was very accommodating and came to check on us at all the right times. 

Towards the end of the dinner, a person from the photo-taking place earlier came by and showed us the picture we took. He asked us if we'd like to purchase it...and we did. It was a picture of us in front of the restaurant (green-screened of course). Not cheap, but hey -- it's our anniversary. This was very good timing, and I'm not sure if this was planned or anything. We were about to pay for our dinner, and we were clearly happy. 

They told us that we could check out other areas of the CN Tower since we ordered an entree each. We totally took advantage of that and basked in the flashing red and white lights. Lovely experience!"}
{"text":"Note there is a special entrance for restaurant guests so you don't have to wait in line, you also instantly get to take a touristy picture that they will print and try to sell you later on. I kept a small note they gave me with a web code and saved a digital copy later on for free :) 

So happy that the chicken and steak is Halal! Call to confirm the details on exactly which steak (only a la carte - not prix fixe) and chicken is Halal. This place is definitely pricey so I went for a special occasion, it's justifiable because normally you'd spend $38 per person just to go up there so I took that into consideration. The ambiance is really fancy. We went for dinner I got the 3-course prix fixe ($79) which was good because we got an app, main and dessert. My husband got the Halal 16 oz rib eye steak ($85) and an order of truffle fries ($11). You also get complimentary bread. Everything was delicious, service was good and the rotating view was amazing. They also wrote \"Happy Birthday\" on my dessert plate. We went to the observation deck after and spent some time. 

The only cons: I requested a table near the window and did not get one, tables were really tight."}
{"text":"Food 3-3.5 Stars,  View and ambience - 4.5 Stars

If you are able to dine here AND get a window seat, it's a beautiful view of the city, especially at dinner right before sunset. The tower revolves and takes almost 1 hour to make a complete revolution.  The ambiance is nice and the staff is attentive.  It's not the most beautiful view I've ever seen from a tower but it's pretty nice and I would dine here again for that view. 

On wards to the food.  A dinner meal for 2 will easily run you over $100 CAD per person if not more.  Hubby had the 3 course prix fixe menu, $79 and I initially started off wanting to try the 3 course but by the end of the 2nd course which I couldn't finish as I was full and didn't like one of the cod servings so I stayed with 2 courses for $65. They do have an ala carte menu and I watched a couple of ladies way smaller than me consume a whole steak and lobster dinner which looked scrumptious.  I should have ordered off the ala carte instead.
If you want free access to go to the lower viewing level of the CN Tower after dinner, then you need to order minimally 2 courses for your meal.  The staff will show you the way (go down the stairs).  

I had the smoked salmon appetizer which was delicious with thin slices of salmon circuitously plated while you circle slowly around and around the city.  
My entree of Fogo Island (local) cod 3 ways was disappointing.  
One was a salt cod fritter with was OK, the cod belly with Yukon Gold potato gratin was the best tasting of the group and I did not like the pan-seared Fogo Island Cod with carrot puree , asparagus and mushrooms.  That cod tasted as if it was dehydrated or dried, then rehydrated before cooking.  I like fish but this dish made me wish I had ordered something else.

Hubby had the chowder which he said was OK but he really liked his prime rib 10, Alberta beef with sour cream, asparagus, au jus. He declined the horseradish. He paired it with a glass of Canadian miritage wine, $14 which was decent tasting. 
Interestingly, a lot of the wines on their list are from California (nothing but the best!).  His hazelnut torte was good but not memorable. He didn't like the crust which was a thick layered, hard cookie-type texture and prefers tarts made with puff pastry.  

The most amusing part of dining here is that if you have to run off to the bathroom and when you return, your dining partner has rotated off and is not where you left him.  I guess it's a good way to ditch a bad date if you were inclined to do so.  
The staff is acutely aware and no less than 2 persons came to my assistance when I am sure I had that befuddled look,  to guide you back to your seat.  That's good training on the part of management."}
{"text":"This downtown Toronto restaurant has an outstanding location and unbelievable view. The view simply cannot be beat. Do not come expecting to have great food. They are living on the location and not the food. It is still worth it just for the atmosphere and the view of the Toronto skyline and lake at
 sunset"}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant! It's a revolving restaurant near the top of the CN Tower and it's 100% worth it for the view alone. You also get free access to the observation deck if you get one of the prix fixe meals and you bypass the observation deck lines, which is fantastic. The food was fantastic (we got prime rib and salmon) and perfectly cooked and we were pleasantly surprised that the restaurant was worth the money overall; we figured we were paying for the view, but the whole experience was great. I definitely recommend this for anyone who hasn't been to the CN Tower before!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple of years ago, obviously the best part is the restaurant rotation #views. I remember the food was ok, didn't blow me away... the prices for the food was way out of my price range but i didn't pay for it so.... lol"}
{"text":"location location eh?

That's what you are paying for.

Spectacular view, interesting experience but food was really disappointing and expensive."}
{"text":"Jaw Dropping! It was great for the special occasion we celebrated. I don't think I could have found a better restaurant in the city! Best view you can get of Toronto! The food was great, but I would have paid just for the experience. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I was not feeling super hungry so, after ordering a $12 cocktail, I asked to order an appetizer, mentioning I'd be ordering dessert later. I was informed that anyone who didn't order a main course, would be charged an \"elevation\" fee. That's crazy. I understand instituting a minimum, but let YOUR CUSTOMER decide what that will be comprised of. 

So, I ordered the grilled veggie entree from the price fix instead of what I wanted. And it was tasty (except the cabbage--turns out cabbage is super bitter grilled!). I was surprised given the bad reviews and what the general word on the street is. But, it was $38! I'm stunned. Stunned! My asparagus, broccolini, and bell pepper cost what a steak should cost. I would greatly have preferred the salad and side I wanted, another cocktail, and some tea with dessert, which would easily have cost more anyway. I'm glad I held off on those because I felt this coming. I did order dessert, but the dark chocolate tower didn't deliver. It was the consistency of marshmallow but not very flavorful or chocolate-y.

The view is spectacular, and the fact the place rotates is just amazing. There isn't a bad seat in the house. Even if you aren't seated along the window, you'll have a beautiful view because those tables not beside a window are elevated. The restaurant is lovely as well, although I hardly looked anywhere but out the window!

The view is certainly 5 stars, and the service is a 4 or 5, but the experience was a 3 because, at the end of the day, I walked out without having what I wanted."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the service was friendly. The view is awesome. I liked the food a lot. I like that if you purchase an entree then you get free admission down onto the observation deck. The entree sizes are very filling. The four of us got our own entree, but in order for me to save room to try dessert, I had to wrap up part of my entree because there was too much for me to finish. (The leftovers tasted good after warming them up in the oven). I'm obsessed with the 360 White Chocolate martini. It is soooooo good. I had 2! The four of us shared 2 desserts to ensure there was nothing left and the desserts were yummy. We had the maple trio (cheesecake, creme brulee, and tart - all containing maple) and the chocolate tower. It's a nice place to go for a special occasion, but with it being such a tourist spot, they are pretty lenient with the dress code. (A little too lenient in my opinion, esp for the price of everything on their menu)"}
{"text":"We went here because parents visiting Toronto, so wanted to show them the bird-view scene of the city along with a decent dinner. The view was really beautiful, but the food and service whereas were not that enjoyable.

The food was not bad, but you can get those kinds of prix fixes anywhere with around $30-35 per person. I ordered 2 courses include the braised rabbit and the dark chocolate tower, the meat tasted pretty plain and greasy (maybe they put too much oil instead of dijon mustard in there). As for the dessert, which I thought a mousse, turns out it's just a sponge cake that was made into a cylinder and pretended to be tasty...didn't like it.

The service was not satisfied too, the waiter was kept implying us to eat faster by various \"methods\", so they can bring the next guests to the table. I mean it's not wrong to come and ask \"how's the food\", but it will be too annoying to have one guy comes with a question \"have you finished\" in every 10 minutes. I know you guys busy, but it's too unprofessional to serve in that way, especially in this type of restaurant with high tip and meal charge.

In conclusion, not recommended except the great views."}
{"text":"Given that an elevator ride alone would have cost over $20, the restaurant is actually a compelling value given its spectacular and romantic views.   The night view is particularly great.

My one issue is that I came with a large group, and when one very thin woman wanted only a salad, the waiter became stern and angry and charged her for the elevator ride.   He could have at least presented the idea that someone else at the table could order an extra main dish."}
{"text":"The 360 Restaurant at the CN Tower was one of those \"must do\" things from a Toronto visitors guide. Being our (wife and I) first time in Toronto, we made a point of making sure we went there for dinner. 

The best thing about dinner there is the view. You can particularly see all of Toronto. Although, if you get motion sickness it is probably not a good idea to have dinner there since the dinning floor spins. 

Now a little bit for the cons. First the staff is somewhat, well...I wouldn't say rude, but like it was almost like we were bothering them for coming there to eat. The person that brought the food basically just dropped our plates on the table and walked away. Hey, how about asking us if there is anything else we need. Now on to the food. The food was not bad. It was cooked and presented well. But you can tell by the price versus the quality of the food that you were paying for the view. The food was perfectly fine, but you would expect that this would be about the same as a $20/plate dinner. But since this was the CN Tower, it was closer to $45/plate. So the word \"overpriced\" would be the correct statement here. Of course for those visiting Toronto for the first time, it is still worth going. Odds are their business is mostly first timers/tourists, like us. Now that we have experienced it, we probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"Even though I live in Toronto, I went to CN Tower first time after 25 years. Of course I am going to go all out, I did the edge walk which was awesome and decided to go the 360 Restaurant. My reservation was at 5pm perfect time to see the whole city view and then end off with the sunset. It was very romantic and classy ambience. I had the dinner- a la carte which included salmon tar tar, butternut squash soup, green salad, honey lemon chicken w/mashed potatos/gravy/veggies, and mango sorbet. Overall food was amazing, excellent service and kick ass view!"}
{"text":"I ordered a fogo island three way cod for the main dish. Fogo island is an island north east of Newfoundland. The island has become increasingly popular which has attracted many tourists from Canada. I was surprised that CN tower was able to serve fish from a tiny island in Newfoundland which makes me wonder the transportation cost that it needs to do so.

Anyway, the fish was average. It wasn't anything spectacular. The restaurant serves you three small fish piece with a bowl of mash potato. Though, you are paying the premium price because this is CN tower and you are eating with a 360 revolving platform. Keep in mind that a two course meal is priced at $65 and three course is priced at $80. This does not include wine."}
{"text":"Went there for a very special occasion and it was so so beautiful! The restaurant, the view, so very romantic and you get to go on a sky deck for free! This restaurant is more of an experience so food almost doesn't matter and if it does, this place isn't worth it. Food is okay at best! Desserts, however, are quite good! I wouldn't go there just because it's extremely expensive and food isn't worth the money, but I'm glad I got to go there once to experience the whole deal."}
{"text":"You are definitely paying for the view. The food is fine. The view is breathtaking.  And including the lookout and glass floor levels it really isn't much more than going for lunch at a decent restaurant and then taking the tour. The reservation process online was easy to use and there were no complications. The food was good. My daughter didn't like the \"big cookie\", nor did I.  Otherwise it was a lovely lunch."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!
Our waiter Carlos was wonderful. 
Great wine list. 
Overall a great experience. 
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"You are paying a bit steep for 2 things... the experience and the view!

Okay, so it's a very touristy place.. that's the only reason why we are taking 1 star away.. At $150 for a meal, one enjoys a pretty nice meal in NYC. At 360 however, we weren't that impressed with the food. We got the $65, 2 course prix fixe option.. 1 appetizer and 1 main course... Mrs. got the ONTARIO LAMB SAUSAGE WITH MINTED SUMMER PEAS (which was really nice, but smaller portion) and I got the SMOKED TROUT AND POTATO CHOWDER (which was delicious, but portion wise, really small).

For main course, Mrs. got the ROASTED BONELESS HALF CHICKEN WITH GREEN OLIVE BUTTERMILK MASHED POTATO and I got the SMOKED PAPRIKA RUBBED NAGANO PORK TENDERLOIN WITH YELLOW PEPPER SOFRITO. The Pork seriously lacked flavor and was really dry and the Chicken wasn't seasoned at all.

Food wise, we didn't really enjoy our entrees... but experience wise, it was really fun.. something different!

Service was really nice. Lisa, our server, made sure we had a very nice and happy experience at 360!"}
{"text":"This review is based on our personal experience, which is perhaps quite different from others. The view was excellent (but not necessarily great from our seats), food blah, service BLah-er, overall experience mediocre. It would have been nice to be seated right next to the window to fully enjoy the view, but sitting in the back, with a view of other diners enjoying their view, plus the not so great food was definitely not worth a $200 meal. Don't get me wrong, we've been to many restaurants where you basically pay for the view but still end up with not the best seats, but those times at least the food somewhat met the palate expectations, unfortunately here it did not.  The appetizers (ham hock and squid) were too cold for our taste and definitely not appetizing. The pork belly and scallops was probably the best thing we tasted but was still just ok. Beware when you order the $11 french fries with \"truffle and aioli sauce\" you have to remind them to add the truffle and aioli because initially it just came out with ketchup, and not even a drizzle of truffle oil. As for the service, they seemed like they had a long day and just wanted to go home, and we didn't deserve the A+ treatment that others received, leaving us to feel as if we shouldn't even ask for a refill of water.  Basically, we should've just skipped out on the restaurant and just gone through the regular admission for the CN tower."}
{"text":"My wonderful best friend and her boyfriend treated me to lunch at this restaurant because I wanted to go to the CN Tower. This restaurant has a price point to match its views. It is a marvel to see the city of Toronto from so high up and since you get a ticket to skip the line to the top with your lunch, you really cannot match this deal. 

Is the food ah-mazing? No. But if you want to impress your friends from out of town (i.e. me), you'll want to check out the lunch deal on this place."}
{"text":"Took my friend out here for a birthday dinner and we really enjoyed our time. I booked it around the evening so we can watch the sunset and it was breathtaking. We had the 3 course dinner. Both our appetizers were okay. We enjoyed our main course and dessert. I found the food really filling compared to what was on the plate. The service was good. It was my first time in the cn tower so I enjoyed the fact that I could see the glass floor. I did find the meal quite expensive with wine it came up to a little over 200. However it is something I'd only do once, so in that sense it was worth it."}
{"text":"My wife and I were very excited to have lunch at the restaurant and it didn't disappoint , our waiter named Babu did a nice job but seemed to forget about us a few times and we ordered the fogo cod and clams and the chicken supreme , very unusual but good nonetheless. And of course the views were absolutely unbeatable ! The only negative was we both ordered a bloody Mary and honestly it was the worst one we have ever had . Give the 360 restaurant a try if even just for the spectacular views while rotating 360 degrees every 72 minutes."}
{"text":"The view was great. The food wasn't bad at all. A pair of well-dressed canadian customers tried to pass us by skipping the photo taking part just to be 1 spot ahead of us? Amazing. A lot of rude customers there. But the waiters were excellent."}
{"text":"I expected the view to be gorgeous, stunning etc. but I was pleasantly surprised by the food. 

I took my family here (they were visiting) and it's a perfect place for visitors. You get a view of Toronto (hopefully it's clear that day) and you get a great meal with it too. A ticket to the Observation deck is $36 but a 3-course meal that includes access to the observation deck is $52 for lunch...hmmm...i'm thinking the lunch is a MUCH better deal. 

Ambience:
Modern, with gorgeous views of the city and Ontario lake. The restaurant revolves and it's perfect for viewing. 

Food:
I wasn't expecting much since the reviews were not exactly glowing. But we must have had good chefs that day

- Grilled Calamari Rapini: grilled perfectly, not chewy or overcooked. My mom and i loved our dish
- Butternut Squash Soup: my sis loved her soup
- Truffle and Chanterelle Tagliate: my dad loved his pasta too
- Beef Short Ribs: fall off the bone tender. good flavor. a little rich for my taste, but definitely hearty
- Salmon: My sis and Mom loved their salmon; the orange demiglace was a perfect balance with the grilled salmon
- Trout with sweet crab: my dad loved his trout 
- Quark Cheese Strudel with rum raisin cream anglaise: i'd suggest skipping this in lieu of...
- Triple Chocolate Espresso Torte: My sis and Dad loved their dessert
- Dark Chocolate Tower: i think it looked better than it tasted but Mom liked it anyway

After our 90 min lunch (it takes about that time for the restaurant to revolve fully), we made our way down to the Observation deck, Glass Floor etc. 

I'd highly suggest either going for lunch or an early dinner so you can see the view and not just city lights. It's definitely a MUCH better deal than just buying tickets to the observation deck. 
It gets more crowded in the restaurant later, so definitely try to go earlier for a more private (and less noisy) experience"}
{"text":"360 really doesn't have the best food, but it certainly has the best view in the city!

seriously, why would you pay admission to the cn tower when you can come here and enjoy an average meal with amazing view with access to cn tower included in your meal!?  there is a revolving platform that circles the towel 360 degrees so you literally get a 360 view of toronto and then some while you're dining.  hence, the 360.

i had the prefixe menu, started out great, but ended poor. 

1)  beet amuse buche:  delicious.  i didn't think i'd like beet so much!  so excited, it's tasting great.
2)  smoked salmon:  not bad, i can do without all the capers (yuck!) but not bad.
3)  sirloin:  i asked for medium, it came out well-done.  should've asked for rare if medium meant well-done for them.
4)  mint chocolate pie:  they were gracious enough for me to swap my dessert, but mint chocolate pie was just meh. 

i can't believe they messed up on my entree!  but that's ok, at least the view of toronto made up for the not-so-good meal :(  they have an impressive wine collection!  so definitely order a bottle of wine.

before or after dinner, enjoy a stroll around the tower for the view!"}
{"text":"I went here 10 years either my family for vacation. In order to get to the restaurant you walk on a floor that is just see through glass and carpet in some area. The food was good, but I'll never forget the giant chocolate dessert that I had. It was even bigger than my face."}
{"text":"Bottom line is that this is a great dining experience not often encountered at a tourist hot spot, the views are to die for, the food is good but I recommend the 2-course options given the massive size of the entrees.

I was surprised at the quality of this restaurant given its touristic location. The cuisine is award-winning and the waiting staff was very professional. The view was of course immaculate with a full 360 degree rotation every 72 minutes allowing you to take in the city and the Atlantic Ocean. 

We made a lunch reservation for 12PM before flying back to New York in the afternoon. You get to cut the (not too long) line for the elevator up once you check in on the 2nd floor and go on a special elevator directly to the restaurant. There was already a decent crowd in the restaurant when we arrived but we still got a window-side seat; these filled up by around 12:30PM and people had to sit in the booths which were 15 feet removed from the window and the view did not appear as nice. 

We opted for the 2-course pre fixe lunch for C$55 per person and were very glad we did not go for the 3-course which included a dessert. 

The appetizers were normal sized:
-Grilled trout soup which was excellently prepared, creamy, and savory
-Filet of salmon, good, nothing too special

The entrees however were huge (and a bit limited on the seafood side, more meat-based):
-Lamb shank, I thought I must've gotten the entire shoulder blade of the animal, was quite filled by the end; this was tasty, but note it has the typical gamy taste not everyone enjoys
-Braised beef short ribs, which were excellent and tender with a nice sauce. This was also huge, came out in a brick that my fiancée could not finish so I ended up stuffing 1/3 of this down the gut as well

By the end we were pretty stuffed and ready for a walk, there are private stairs to take you to the observatory deck and see-through floor levels which was convenient.

A suggestion is to remember the number of your section as the restaurant rotates and you can get slightly confused, I walked the wrong way to the bathroom and did a full circuit around."}
{"text":"I am rating this 4 stars because of the view and the people. The view was impeccable, having lived in Toronto for my whole life this is the best view of the city I have ever had! It was right around 7:45 when me and my girlfriend of 1 year started our anniversary dinner we got too see the sunset it was so beautiful and romantic. The waiter was nice had a great smile too. The food on the other hand was sub par. My steak was 79$ I asked for medium it was cooked well, but for 79$ it left a bad taste in my mouth! That taste was overpriced! Other then that I had a dark chocolate tower for desert it was delicious! The chocolate just melted in your mouth! That was worth the 14$ I payed for it it might have been worth more! Overall it was a splendid experience, I recommend everyone should go at least once for the view and the desert!

{"text":"Come for the view - a truly unique experience!

This has been echoed by many of my fellow yelpers but the 360 restaurant is really all about the view.  If you go for dinner, try going at around 730 pm or so (this is for the summer) so that you are seated during broad daylight and get to watch the environment shift into sunset, then eventually twilight as your meal progresses!  You will get to see all of Toronto regardless of where you sit as the restaurant literally rotates in a full circle every hour or so.  Afterwards, you can head to the glass floor and outside area to do the normal touristy things.

The food is quite expensive, but  I thought it was fairly priced given the fact that the purchase of a meal results in free elevation up to the top as well as the ability to completely skip the long lines.  I went for the $55 prix fixe dinner option and also split a 41 dollar bottle of riesling with a friend.  The food was decent quality but make no mistake, you are paying for the view.

I would try and reserve your table online in advance as the restaurant can get quite packed.  Also, attire seemed to be a mostly smart casual with some people opting for more formal business attire.  My group mostly wore jeans/khakis and a button down shirt and this was in line with the attire of other diners."}
{"text":"This was my favorite meal of my entire trip through Toronto. Not only are the views amazing here, but the food is top quality, and the price you would pay to take the elevator up to the tower anyway is dropped (however, the meal isn't cheap, so it all sort of evens out).

We decided to do brunch here on Sunday, instead of coming for a dinner, because we were told the reservations had to be made at least a week in advance and it was too difficult to plan our schedule that way. I'm actually glad we made that decision, because I got to try one of my favorite dishes which probably wouldn't have been offered on the dinner menu.

The setting here is fantastic. The dark wood tables, and very open layout are so friendly to the eye, and then you've got the great views of the harbor to accent it all. The waitstaff is also one of the best I've encountered, and they weren't shy about taking pictures with each of our 10 cameras (I'm sure this is quite a regular request here).

I chose to go with the 3 course menu instead of the 4, as I didn't think the amuse bouche they were offering was worth the $12 difference in price, and after seeing someone else who ordered it I'm pretty sure I was right.

My first course was the tarragon infused, wild mushroom and leek broth, which featured summer chanterelles, truffle oil, and scallion threads. This smelled amazing, especially if you love the earthiness of mushrooms, and the flavor of the broth was very nice, but the textures were way off. To start, the overall lack of mushrooms was a big disappointment. I think there were only 4 or 5 in my bowl. It was however LOADED with scallion bits, entirely way too many in my opinion, and the textures were too firm. The guy sitting next to me went with the poached shrimp \"cocktail\" with Mary rose and cocktail sauces, and included 5 huge, perfectly cooked shrimp. I was quite jealous.

For my main course I could not resist the spinach and berkshire double smoked bacon quiche \"lorraine\" with sweet potato fries, frisse salad and cherry tomato vinaigrette. This is one of my favorite ways to prepare quiche, and it's so hard to find one that is really well done, because most restaurants do it as an afterthought. It was absolutely flawless (check out the pictures, it's oozing deliciousness). The mix of ingredients was perfect, and you could taste every ingredient quite distinctly. This was by far the best quiche I have ever had, anywhere. The sweet potato fries were also done perfectly, and people at the table had a hard time keeping their hands off my bowl.

Desert was a bit unusual, as I don't typically go for it at lunch, but I must say what I ordered I was pleased with, especially considering the heavy options that others at the table chose. I decided to go with the warm apple and bitter cherry tart, with puff pastry and vanilla ice cream. The flavors were great and light enough not to make me want to crawl into bed feeling bloated after. The cherries were especially nice, and went brilliantly with the vanilla.

You can definitely drop some cash here. The wine list is probably the best I saw in Toronto, and they have some seafood \"towers\" in the hundreds of dollars, the likes of which I've never seen anywhere else. Of course, it's a perfect date restaurant if you're trying to impress, just try to make sure you stay looking at each other and not the awesome view the whole time."}
{"text":"5 stars for the view but 3 for the food. Our server was great and recommended a great starter we enjoyed but the prime rib was below Outback standard and the chicken dish was just average. The view is incredible and the service standard for this type of restaurant. With seeing the view during dinner there is no reason to go a floor below for the viewing deck and the glass floor is crowded and tiny so not that big of a deal"}
{"text":"This meal was surprisingly fantastic. I had lowered my expectations because tourist traps generally don't try especially hard. We went for brunch and had the prix fixe menu. The bellinis were delicious - good house champers. The summer tomato salad with smoked mozzarella and tomato sorbet was an original take on a standard. The supreme of chicken was perfectly cooked and the desserts were both awesome. 

Delicious meal aside, the view is fantastic. Wonderful way to take in Toronto."}
{"text":"It's one of those things that you just have to do it once while you are in Toronto.  A two-course prix fixe lunch costs CAN$58 which includes a ride in the glass elevator, admission to the observation deck, and the glass floor.  If you think CAN$58 is a bit steep for lunch, consider the fact that general admission alone is CAN$36.  In that respect, your gourmet lunch only costs you an additional CAN$22 (plus tips).

Believe me that it's worth it.  After lunch, we went downstairs to the observation deck and it was nothing like the peaceful, relaxing, and enjoyable lunch by the window side of this rotating restaurant which completes a 360-degree revolution in 72 minutes.

The observation deck was crowded and it was hard to find a good spot to enjoy the view or to take a nice picture.  While navigating through the crowd, you also have to be careful and not getting hit by the dozens of selfie sticks.  After soaking in an hour-long panoramic view in the restaurant, we saw no point of lingering in the observation deck.

As for the food, I went there with a reasonably low expectation but was very pleasantly surprised.

ROASTED ONTARIO CHICKEN SUPREME:  It was a quarter of a chicken with the breast and part of the wing and it was roasted perfectly well.  The skin was golden brown; the meat was moist, tender, and flavorful.  The gravy was a slightly sweet and tangy black currant and pink pepper jus which complemented the chicken very well.  

PAN ROASTED DUCK SAUSAGE:  One bite and you could taste that it was freshly made and minimally processed.  The sausage had a coarse and meaty texture and you can actually bite into and taste the duck meat.  The gravy was a reduction jus with a rich maple flavor, sprinkled with some brandied cherries, and a hint of chili that gave the dish a little heat.  It was so delicious that I would rank this in my top-five list of the best sausages that I've ever had.

If I must be picky and take a star off, I would complain that the signs to the restaurant were not clear.  There was supposed to be a separate line (and elevator) going to the restaurant but it was not clear at all.  I had to ask many people along the way to get there.  And there was a separate check-in for those who have already made a reservation on Open Table, but again the signage was not clear.  The reception area at the restaurant was a bit chaotic and clearly understaffed.  Considering the fact that each elevator emptied a couple of dozen people, the line formed rather quickly if the reception staff were not quick and efficient."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with amazing seafood, a nice wine list, and a breathtaking view. We had a group of five (1 senior, 2 adults, a teenager, and a child) and everyone found something they thoroughly enjoyed. Everyone in the grouped enjoyed their dinner and the view.  My boys especially enjoyed watching the planes land on the nearby islands.

Bill was a great server and the ambiance was nice...plus the two observations decks were included when you eat at the 360 and there was no long line to wait in.  
Skipping the long lines was completely worth the price of dinner!   Not to mention the views and amazing food!"}
{"text":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.... TRUST ME. 

I went here for a friend's birthday dinner. Just getting to the restaurant is a pain as you have to go through several touch points (expect line ups for security check, getting your reservation slip and heading to the elevator). 

SERVICE
I found the service to be very good and attentive so that I would give that 4/5. And of course the view is impressive and the only reason anyone should come here.

FOOD
What a joke - I paid over $100 for a glass of wine, some soup and a lousy chicken dinner that I couldn't even finish. I've had much better food all over the city and outside of it for far less...even the free birthday dessert was a let down (I believe it was there chocolate tower).

AMBIENCE
Ambience was horrendous and that combined with the food is the reason for the 1 star rating. This restaurant draws in A LOT of tourists that drag around small children and babies. So for our dinner we had a screaming toddler sit by us, and then by the end of a meal a 1 year old baby...I get that they are families, but this is not Kelsey's where it's expected. This is a fine dining experience where you'll pay $22 for a 6oz glass of wine.... so yeah it would be nice not to have screaming children who I doubt want to be there themselves. 

OVERALL
If you're looking to celebrate a special occasion go some where else, you'll get more for your money and a far better experience."}
{"text":"Overpriced but it's worth it!
If you are visiting Toronto, I fully recommend! It's a good restaurant with a great view."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at the restaurant. The ambience, the view, service, and the food (salmon) were all close to perfect. My friend and I had a good time, and we sat next to the window (highly recommended since you can see the entire downtown and even parts of the Niagara falls) and saw the roof of my hotel (Fairmont). It was fun and would visit again."}
{"text":"We dined here for my birthday lunch and it was my first time here.  First off, you know you're mainly dining here for the views so without a doubt, that alone makes the experience worth it!  It was a crisp yet sunny afternoon and the bird's eye of Toronto was mesmerizing.

We opted for the 3-course prix fixed menu.  Mushroom chowder appetizer was quite tasty; salmon and prime rib of beef were quite delectable yet fare typical of similar restaurants 'on the ground'; and apple crisp with ice cream and dark chocolate delice topped it off quite perfectly.  I even had a cute 'happy birthday' shout-out on white chocolate.

Service was relaxed and all our needs were met.  We were not rushed through our 1.5 hr. lunch.  We got to thoroughly enjoy the views and take breathtaking photos.  Complimentary access to the observation deck and glass floor was a treat too although we've been there before so didn't stay too long.  

Would recommend this restaurant as a classy escape from the usual dining experiences to celebrate special occasions and as a nice way to efficiently play tourist at the CN Tower and tick off an item on the culinary to-dos."}
{"text":"I spent New Years in Canada and decided the CN Tower was a must see! After finding out that they waive the $30 admission fee if you dine here, we decided to do just that. We were able to call and get reservations a few hours prior to our arrival. We were also able to bypass the long line for those not dining, so this was a win-win situation for us! The speedy elevator whizzes us up to the 113th floor and as we exited, we were wowed by the view. We requested a table by the window and they were happy to accommodate us. The view was absolutely AMAZING. It reminded me of the fabulous and very much missed Windows On The World in NYC. Having said that, the view alone requires you to dine here at least once! Throughout our dinner, the restaurant slowly revolved. It takes approximately 75 mins for a full revolution, so you won't miss a thing if you have a full meal. 

After we are seated, we wait a while to place our order. Our waiter unfortunately had a huge party at the table next to us, so that took up a lot of his time. Despite the slow beginning, our service turned out to be decent. Some of us did the prix fixe menu ($65 and $75), but I elected to order from the regular menu so I could get exactly what I wanted. I did a few calculations and it wasn't much more than the $75 prix fixe offerings. I started out with the clam chowder. It was pretty tasty and loaded with seafood. For the main course, I ordered the Prime rib. That was also was tasty. I absolutely loved the rosemary bread pudding that accompanied it. My friends ordered the Lavender honey glazed half chicken, and that was also excellent. The portions were large enough for us to take home leftovers. For dessert, we had the Apple Rhubarb crumble, and the Pumpkin cheesecake! They were both amazing. We cleaned our plates and headed downstairs to the viewing area. I totally enjoyed my 360 and CN Tower experience!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Toronto, wanted to see the city view from the CN tower, and had lunch there for the hubby's birthday. I made the reservation three days ago on open table and then reconfirmed by calling this morning and requesting a table by the window. The restaurant makes a revolution every 72 minutes and we did not feel rushed to leave. 

Our group chose the 2 course lunch for $58. I had the 360 green salad which was very light and fresh and delicious. It far exceeded my low expectations for a tourist restaurant, in fact, I'd love to replicate it at home. The duck sausage main course was fantastic. We didn't care for the squid appetizer because the squid seemed tough and overly smoky. Hubby thought his pork belly and scallop dish was mediocre. One daughter had risotto which she said was, \"good.\" The other daughter had prime rib medium rare which she gobbled up but it looked a bit more toward medium to me. 

I ordered the wine pairings with my 360 salad and duck sausage and they were really were the perfect accompaniments. There's a reason this restaurant has won wine awards! 

The kiddos ordered $12 non alcoholic drinks that include take home glasses with the tower etched on the side. Our server brought us a bag with new glasses wrapped and ready to go, at the end of the meal, which dazzled the girls. 

Hubby was given a yummy chocolate lava cake with happy birthday written in chocolate around the plate edge. It was a nice addition to his meal. Our server thought the youngest had ordered the lava cake and ended up giving us the extra one. 

The service was a tad slow but we prefer that to being rushed through a celebratory meal. I think we could have sped up the service if we had asked. 

It was an unforgettable birthday and I'd go back for another special occasion. I also recommend it for a first visit to the CN tower as it costs $36 for general admission to two tower levels. Everyone must go through the security check and metal detector but after that process it seemed like we breezed through to the 360 elevator with our lunch reservation."}
{"text":"So, if your in town and visiting Toronto's best attraction, I recommend sitting down and eating at the top of the CN tower. One adult ticket inside the tower is $32 dollars. A Pre Fixe Lunch is $55 with free access to the observation deck. I look at lunch being $23 dollars. You get a 3 course lunch. Appetizer, Lunch, Dessert, And a awesome view! What more do you want!

The food was amazing! Their wine list is a mile long and the restaurant revolves so you can experience all of Toronto. 

I had the Trout for appetizer, deelish. Main dish was the Salmon with potato and salad. The flavors were out of this world. I had Mango sorbet for dessert.

Service levels are extremely high and the people are friendly. 

I will definitely be back to do this again."}
{"text":"While the meals are expensive, a minimum of $56, you save the $25 fee of going to the top of the CN tower so as a tourist it's worth it. The food is excellent quality. My wife and I got a sea food sampler platter and 10 oz prime rib steak. Seafood felt very fresh, the platter included crab claws, salmon and oysters. While the description for the prime rib is 10 oz I think our cut was 16, we had to take more than half home, it was juicy and delicious.

The slow rotation took us all 360 around Toronto during our one and a half hour meal. We especially enjoyed seeing the lake view."}
{"text":"One word describes the 360......Brilliant. This is the fourth time I've visited the 360 restaurant, and I've been overjoyed every single time I've went. 

My girlfriend and I headed out for lunch yesterday, and arrived at 12:15, to a surprising empty restaurant. Our waiter was extremely courteous, and spoke with a professional tone. I ordered the 3 course lunch, with a Shrimp appetizer, spinach stuffed chicken supreme, served with a unique sauce and mixed vegetables.  My girlfriend ordered the BC salmon (paired with a rosé) and it was cooked to perfection, along with scallops and potato in a cream based sauced. 

For dessert, she ordered the lemon meringue (pictured) and the display, along with the taste, was fantastic. It was accompanied by a torched marshmallow, fried orange peel, and whipped cream. I ordered the Lindt milk chocolate ice cream, which is by far the best ice cream I've ever had. 

Although I do agree with it being very pricy, it is worth every cent. The view is absolutely breathtaking, and the fact the restaurant revolves makes it even cooler; to get a full 360 view of Toronto. While waiting for food, my girlfriend and I played a neat game. We looked at places on maps and tried to find it from the tower. 

Overall, I recommend this place to everyone. Though the price is steep, make an exception and try it out at some point. You'll be glad you did

Edit: Check out the Louis XIII Magnum. $80 000 bottle of cognac"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this 3 and a half stars. 

Let me start of with the ambiance and view. Honestly, It really and truly is amazing, and I do recommend it for dates, special birthdays, anniversaries, and for tourists. The inside of the restaurant is huge, and I love the seating arrangements and the lighting and how everything is placed. The view is beautiful and breath taking, especially in the late afternoon-night. I haven't been since the twelfth grade for a friend's 18th birthday, but I can still remember the view in my mind. 

The food is alright. I can honestly say I did not enjoy the bruschetta at all, but I loved the crab soup, and the steak. However, it is very pricey.

The service was really good, the servers were very friendly and accommodating. 

Overall, like most have mentioned, you are paying for the view."}
{"text":"We come here when we entertain our colleagues from overseas.  Fixed price $60 for 3 courses is pretty good when you factor in the $35 it would normally cost you to ride up the CN Tower.  The food is okay  and the view is spectacular although it gets noisy with a lot of large groups chattering.  Service ranges in attentiveness depending on the night.  I've had spot on and rushed / neglectful service.  Most recently it was the little things that were missed.  Drop off your food but don't offer pepper or steak knives for the steak such that you have to chase them down.  Do it once in your life if you live in the GTA."}
{"text":"I've heard mixed reviews about this restaurant and this is the second time I've eaten here. A friend was here earlier this week for his wife's birthday dinner and he complained about how expensive it was ($230 for dinner for tw and one alcoholic drink for one person). I would say if you want to enjoy the experience and pay as minimally as you can, go for lunch on someone's birthday or when celebrating a special occasion. Menu is pre-fixed for $56 two-course or $69 for 3-course. If you get the two course and it's for a birthday you can let them know and they'll bring our a birthday dessert (chocolate lava cake) so you'll get a free dessert. The food is pretty good. We got the mushroom soup to start and salmon as the entree. My mom and husband enjoyed it. I got the pumpkin and onion tart to start and the chick pea and purple cornmeal polenta as my entree. The only thing I didn't like was the pickled carrot and celery on the pumpkin tart...it was as sour as eating a lemon- no exaggeration! Portion sizes are decent. You get bread and whipped butter to start so all together it fills the stomach. 
As for ambiance, you don't get any higher than this. Beautiful view of the city and I LOVE the revolving concept. There's no bad seat in the room because after an hour and a half you'll get the 360 view. It's the perfect place to celebrate a milestone or a special occasion. I booked through Open Table and let them know it was my Mom's birthday and I didn't have to remind them about the candle-lit cake at the end - they brought it out after our meal. 
Once you're done eating, you can go down to the lower level to the observation deck and then a level below that to the glass floor. 
Mom enjoyed her birthday and husband was satisfied."}
{"text":"Declaration of biases:
-I think that the construction of pointless concrete sticks (Space Needle, CN Tower, ...) is stupid and makes a city uglier.
-I didn't pay for my meal at 360 Restaurant, or even see how much it should have cost. I was there for a corporate event.

I really enjoyed my food at 360. The shot glass of gazpacho was probably the best I've had, and I wish I could have made a whole meal of it.  The escargot and snapper were great.  I see that Yelp has this place listed at four dollars signs, which seems a little outrageous; I need a really special occasion in order to spend the money for even a three dollar signs place! I think the deciding factor for most will be the view. It's certainly a great one, so it just depends on how much you care about that sort of thing.  If it was my money, I'd rather spend it on hipper, more fun place with a lesser view (or none at all)."}
{"text":"The view was spectacular! Our waiter was attentive and the food was delicious. I had the scallops and pork belly and my husband had the duck, both were delicious. Tickets to the observation deck and glass floors were included with our dinner so it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"This is a very good choice if you're visiting Toronto. You want to see the city and the CN tower is a must. By booking the 360 restaurant you get to visit the tower including the observation deck and the glass floor without paying for admission. You do pay for a two or three course meal at a good restaurant. The service is excellent and the courses are cordon bleu standard, as are the wines. No hurry here, and the views are absolutely unbeatable. The restaurant takes seventy two minutes per revolution, and the meal is worth at least a couple of laps.
It isn't cheap and it is a tourist trap, but it is worth every penny."}
{"text":"Keep in mind that you're paying for the \"360 view.\" 

I've actually been here a few times, all for special occasions. I remember when I first went and I thought it would be a really fancy place however, its a mixed crowd with mostly families on long weekends. So don't worry about under dressing! 
Originally, I made a reservation for 8 PM (the day of) but my family got hungry and we were already downtown around 5 PM. Wanting to save the day, I called the restaurant and the person who picked up was very helpful. It was 5:20 PM and I asked if they were accepting walk-ins and for how much longer. She told me that they would be for another 30 minutes.
Ran to the restaurant ahead of my family and managed to get a table for 5 just before the cut-off. A man named Carlos was our server and he was wonderful and very considerate of Chinese dining and culture. The main reason we came to 360 was for my grandfather to get a view of the city (touristy) and to experience European-styled dining. Although the menu was very limited and didn't suit my grandfather's liking, he tried his best to make substitutions and make us feel welcomed. 
We brought individual plates to our table and aligned our entrees down the middle so we could all share. Here's a list of what we've ordered:
Appetizers - mushroom chowder (really didn't like it. It had a vinegary base), Niagara charcuterie (not bad)
Entrees - maple tarragon brined supreme of chicken (it was well cooked and not dry), Quebec pork tenderloin (a bit dry but we got well done), Niagara Pancetta wrapped fogo island cod (my grandfather enjoyed this), Atlantic Salmon (ok), and Barley and almond gnocchi (crispy-ish).
Desserts - apricot frangipane tart (this was good), warm caramel apple crisp (it looked like there was cotton candy on top?), lemon raspberry verrine (love the sweet and sour combination)

Once again, Carlos was very informative and told us we could do 5 entrees with 2 appetizers and 3 dessert, which would come to a total of five 2 courses. 

If it wasn't for the great service before and during our meals, I probably would've left $400 shorter and unhappy. 
Food wise, this wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Went to 360 for a company dinner, so we got the special treatment, but even without it I would say that the service was good and attentive. The restaurant itself is what you would expect from a spinning restaurant at the top of a tall tower - expensive, fancy, good food. But not GREAT food. Even though the prime rib was quite delicious (so was the wine), you're really paying for the experience, rather than the meal.

They also have liquor that come out of taps. TAPS. I want one for the kitchen at home."}
{"text":"360 is the quintessential \"if you're on an expense account\" or \"I have a special occasion and need something over the top\" kind of place. I was type A- in Toronto for work and my client needed to woo me so, I expected the evening to be a little cheese-tastic... lots of boring work-related talk and order something I normally would not order on my own dime and be ready to get back to the hotel by the time I finished off my appetizer. However, that was not the case! 

The experience proved to be less cheesy than I initially thought it would be and the food quite a bit better than most people had described on Yelp. My dining companions were alright after all. The ambiance was lovely and service pretty good. And of course, there were the prerequisite business and bachelorette dinners occurring all around. 

All the men at the table ordered a ridiculously large serving of meat, which they all raved over and the girls leaned toward the lighter offerings. Everyone seemed happy. No one complained of being disoriented as the ball spun round. In fact, it was a really nice, ever-changing view of Toronto at night. A very pleasant experience that I would likely not spend the money on if I had to pay for myself!"}
{"text":"First off, my mother and I had gotten a Canadian vacation through Amtrak, along with a dinner at the 360 Restaurant - for an additional $200. 

With this package restaurant deal, we are able to get an appetizer along with an entree and desert off of a separate menu; labeled \"Fit Menu B\". This phantom \"Fit Menu B\" seemed to be something that many people didn't do, and we had to ask for the menu privately. 

To begin, this 'restaurant' is cramped. It was, granted, a Friday night - but cramped and loud as ever. As being taken to the table, there are three rows of seats. One by the window, one in the middle and the big booths on the side, all fairly close to the glass of the windows. 

We were seated and given menus, after we explained that we had a different menu, another girl gave us our \"Fit Menu B\". The waitress then came back, but brought a different attitude with her, a very unprofessional one. She almost seemed like she was angry because we had a menu that didn't have the $100 crab legs on it. Our waitress was just about one of the worst I've personally ever experienced (other than every waitress at every Denny's). My mother and I almost felt neglected, after we would see her check in on other tables and walk right past us - not asking us how our food was ONCE. She didn't even bring us our food, water or bread.

The water 'boy' was a middle aged ethnic man who talked so fast and had such and accent it was hard to even understand what he was saying. It's almost like they didn't see us, or something; they would walk right past us time after time. There were many times that we had to ask for water, and bread; which might I add, was actually crusty/stale on the end parts. After almost an hour of dirty looks and awkward attempts at staying clear of the 1 foot area between the tables - it was clear we were not wanted. 

Past the service part and onto the food...it was OK. The salad was a few stalks thrown together and lightly DRIZZLED dressing. Not sure if they think less dressing is more classy or what, but much of my salad was left dressing-less. 

I had gotten the spaghetti and my mother got the prime rib. We have to admit, the prime rib was pretty good, along with my spaghetti. And it was just that, good nothing really to come back for. The desert was a mango moose that was topped with strawberries for some reason.

All together, we weren't given any closure on when to leave or what to do. So, we just got up and left, remembering that the bill along with the tip were both included with the paper printed voucher we gave the woman who seated us. 

I think a lot of this restaurant tries to rest it's heavy shoulders on the fact that it's really a tourist attraction and not a restaurant. Sure, this place has potential - in fact it had it's potential around last year. Just check the stats for the past few years, it's quite interesting; the rating have just been going down. 

Cons:
- WAY. WAY. WAY, too pricey. 
- Terrible service, unprofessional attitudes.
- What seemed like uncoordinated staffing.
- Cramped spacing and seating.

Pro:
- Nice lighting.
- View was spectacular.
- Food wasn't terrible, but worth $200? Maybe not...

Final Conclusion:

Eat here with the full intention to be spending over $250, for just 2 people. Eat here also if you would like a fabulous view of the Toronto city along with it's fast lake and waters. Dining here will also include a feeling of being rushed and unimportant. Will not being going back."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday here which was a surprise for me - A lot of thought and planning had gone into the evening to make it ever so special for me.
Unfortunately the waiter ruined our experience - he wanted us to \"hurry up\" and place our order. He brought out the appetizer almost as fast as I could order it... The main course was immediately thrown in front of us before we had even finished the appetizer. 

That's when I finally said something to the waiter. I mentioned that we (myself and my friend) were here to celebrate my birthday and would like to not feel so \"rushed\". He then exclaimed that they had to serve \"900 people and this is the way it works here\". 
Seems like more of an assembly line than a fine dining experience to me. I will definitely NEVER RETURN. 

The view is of course stunning but they service is brutal. The food was a 3/5. The dessert was the best part."}
{"text":"We spent the weekend in Toronto and thought we'd check it the 360 Restaurant for lunch before we left. 

First off the experience and your surroundings are amazing.  You truly are paying the premium for the view.  The menu is expensive but if you consider normal entrance to the CN Tower is $30+ you are basically paying regular prices for a fancy dinner. 

On to the dining experience.  We made reservations for 11am because we were leaving right after to head back to the states.  I'm not sure if it was because we were so early, but the waiters and staff were very robot-like and did not really make you feel comfortable.  Not sure if that's the case all the time or maybe because it was just early.  I'm not saying the staff was mean but they just did not really have a personality. 

I ordered the Bison steak a la carte and asparagus.  The bison was recommended to be cooked medium rare, which wasn't a problem.  Bison tasted okay.  It was not anything unbelievable or I would crave again.  The asparagus was generic and served with a piece of butter on top. 

My girlfriend ordered the 2 course meal.  She had a Caesar salad with bacon.  The salad came with a drizzle of dressing and a couple nice big chunks of bacon.  She loved the bacon but the salad was too plain for her because of the lack of dressing.  The waiter recommended she try the arugula ricotta agnolotti.  It basically looked like a pirogi shaped noodle stuffed with arugula ricotta.  It tasted very bitter and she did not like it at all.  She took half a bite and left the rest.  The waiter came around and we told him that she did not really like it and she ordered a side of fries lol.  The waiter did not really make any attempts to try to fix the situation and maybe offer her half off the entree or a free dessert.  I should add I tried a piece of the dish and it really was very bland and bitter.  Nothing I would enjoys. 

Overall it is something someone should experience but the food is not anything amazing.  The steak and eggs I had at Boca earlier that day made my bison steak taste like spam, but that could just be my taste buds.

I'm giving this place 2 stars only because of the amazing view.  The service and menu lacked."}
{"text":"I guess I have to say the same just like countless others have. You come here for the view. The food is just a distraction. Food is mediocre at best and incredibly over priced !! But the view was absolutely fantastic and breath taking !!!  

Like the guide explained.. The restaurant makes a complete circle in 72 min... We were there for 72 min and loved every minute of it :) Ordered the steak which was cold by the time it arrived and the chowder was bleh at best :) my friend ordered the Cesar salad which was hardly a handful and the tart was edible to say the least ;)"}
{"text":"Myself, wife, and kids had a great experience at 360.  We dined for lunch just prior to catching a Blue Jays game in their closely neighboring ball park.  The casual atmosphere lunch afforded was appreciated since our ball clothes consisted of some very casual attire.  Dining in provided us quick VIP access to the tower without the additional ticket expense of just purchasing a ride to the viewing levels.  We enjoyed great good in the rotating dining room.  We went around just over one complete revolution during our meal so we got to enjoy the city view and the bay which was phenomenal.  A private stair case down to the public viewing levels exited the restaurant so it was a complete tower experience.  The food was pricey, but enjoying the iconic Toronto CN Tower in such a privileged way made it worth every dime."}
{"text":"2 stars. 1 for the view and 1 for the service. Our waiter Kelly was excellent! Food was possibly the worst I have ever had. Prime rib very undercooked and looked awful. We had to send it back to the kitchen.  The duck was bland and dish was cold..close to inedible.great to see the view but v expensive for food  that is not of a high standard."}
{"text":"The food was good, but not as spectacular as you'd expect for the price. You're really paying for the view.  The restaurant is pretty cramped, and the tables are so tiny I was constantly afraid of knocking my wine over. The watermelon and feta salad was fantastic.  I had some sort of fish 3 ways main course, it was okay, but not great.   This is the sort of place you go once every 3 or 4 years for a special occasion. 

The service was great, but now that I've been I probably wouldn't be back unless it was just for drinks."}
{"text":"Three stars only because Im rating the food. LOVED the salad. The goat cheese asparagus tortellini left much to be desired. Kids left half their meals, but devoured dessert. Ride up in glass elevator. Revolving view made the meal worth the price. Visit for the experience, not the food."}
{"text":"Really wonderful experience having lunch here on a special occasion, when my cousin graduated from U of T. Three of us had a beautiful seat right on the outside of the restaurant with a view for miles and miles of Toronto and the surrounding countryside. 

The service was personal, attentive and kind, while the food was hot and DELICIOUS. We had two apps- the charcuterie plate (including Riesling poached fresh figs!) and the beet plate (hearty and delicious). For the main course we had the salmon (YUM), chicken and Ontario pickerel. For dessert, we all had a bit of a chocolate dish pictured on the menu that was garnished with gold. The selection of mixed drinks and craft beers was also great. 

After eating, they invite you to walk downstairs to see the regular viewing decks. You get the whole experience! 

If you're looking for a dining experience that will make your day feel really special- this is the spot."}
{"text":"Restaurant with a view.

We chose this place for a business dinner. The revolving restaurant provides the best view. Try to get seated close to the window. The wine selection is amazing. I tried the lamb chops and did justice without any appetizers. Do not end without the maple syrup three way dessert."}
{"text":"The star is simply for the food and service: It's not good. 

Natasha was good, but we didn't see her many of the times we needed her (like for water, to tell her we didn't get a side dish we ordered,  to grab dessert, & for the check). 

On the menu, it's perceived that everyone must choose a 2 or 3 course menu. We asked Natasha if those who are not eating, if we can just pay for the entrance to the tower, and she said that's fine. We were happy about that. 

The food wasn't good. Period. 
The squid salad was super fishy, the fries were super salty, the scallops we're gummy, and the prime rib was rubbery. The desserts (which took over 30+ minutes to get ugh) were just ok, nothing I'd go gaga over. 

For the party of 8 plus 2 kids, we spent over $650 and you have to remember: not everyone ordered a meal!

Would I go back? Nah. Not worth the time or money. I'd rather go to the tower first thing in the morning and then be over with it. Maybe even do the skywalk (but that's also super expensive!)."}
{"text":"Wow.....I have to say I was told how bad the food was at 360 and I have to say they were not right....the food is very decent.  Is it worthy of the price....hard to say....I have had better for cheaper, but the food and view are good enough to justify the price and the experience. I would suggest you do it once, but probably not worth the second trip unless you are with out of town guests.  Otherwise, go have fun, enjoy the view and relax...."}
{"text":"We came here primarily for the view, which was phenomenal. The service was also wonderful, as is expected for a restaurant this costly. The food was good, but probably not worth the price. The ambience was really nice though. It's a great (albeit expensive) way to experience CN Tower if you're not expecting food that will blow you out of the water."}
{"text":"I blew my wallet coming here for dinner and I don't think I'll regret it. My fiancé had a blast here, probably the best surprise dinner she has got from me. She wasn't expecting the cost to be so high, but it's a given when you're at The CN Tower!

The food was good, but it's worth noting that you can probably get the same quality at The Keg or Baton Rouge. But obviously when you're here, you're not coming for the food.. You're coming for the experience. That is exactly why I brought my fiancé here - for the evening experience! We both had the ultimate prix feast, so that consisted of a few fancy named appetizers I cannot pronounce, steak + whole lobster, dessert and a bottle of wine of your choice. The steak was mouthwatering goodness and when I took the first bite, I had thought I wet myself a little lol. Jokes aside, the food was incredibly made, fine dining at its.. finest! The service was also something to take note of - 11 out of 10 stars for friendliness and well mannered gestures. He was absolutely grrrrrrreat throughout the evening, always following up with us and asking how our night was. Simply impeccable service and outstanding management (GOOD JOB GUYS!)

4 stars for the food experience, 5 stars for service and another 5 stars for the awesome skyline view of Toronto. That is a total of 14 stars!  :)"}
{"text":"360 Restaurant offers amazing views of Toronto. It is a bit of a tourist trap. However, the food is actually not bad considering it is a bit of a tourist trap.  

For dinner, the 360 Restaurant offers a 2 course meal for $65 and a 3 course meal for $79.  General admission to the CN tower is included in the price of your dinner (a value of $36). Depending on how you look at it, dinner is a value add if you're interested in seeing the CN tower anyways. If you were not interested in seeing the CN tower, then dinner may be pricey.

The food is not bad, but do not go in expecting \"Michelin\" quality.  This is a restaurant that serves thousands of guests a day.  It is better than what you would expect at a restaurant that caters mainly to tourists. The ingredients are fresh and local. However, there are better restaurants in Toronto if you are merely interested in having a good meal. The service is attentive. Despite being a busy restaurant, the waits are minimal and service is efficient. 

I would recommend this restaurant if you want to see the CN tower and decent food. If you simply want a good meal, there are many other options in Toronto. If you want a restaurant with a view and extraordinary food, then try Canoe."}
{"text":"Food was good and the view was even better. I ordered a pork chop from the a la carte menu which was really tasty and huge. I also ordered the dark chocolate tower and B52 coffee for desert; also great! Service was a little slow but not to the point where I was unsatisfied.

Everything is pricy ($100+ for person for just food) since you're dining at the top of the CN tower, the 3rd tallest building in the world, but it's so worth it for the view and the experience. Also consider the fact that admission price is \"waived\" when dining, which is normally $36 a person. If you want to go but don't want to spend a lot at least go for a drink and desert. 

Need to make a reservation and arrive at least 20 minutes early because it takes a while to go through security and wait on the elevator lines.

I will definitely go back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Ok food. Amazing views obviously. The service was slow and not that professional.drinks were not bad. You come here for the experience and not the best food or service."}
{"text":"Long wait even though we had booked it days in advance 
Food was not very impressive 
But if you are going there for the view and experience... it is still worth it
We were lucky enough to see the air show while enjoying our lunch that day! It was very exciting and an experience we will never forget!"}
{"text":"Freakin majorly overly expensive man. We didn't get to enjoy the views  because were seated more inward towards the center of the restaurant and the food was grossly expensive and tasted no batter than what I could have gotten at say a Ruth Chris. 

This would be a one and done for me."}
{"text":"Excellent meal, service and view.  Very pricey!
The prime rib was awesome and the lobster was thick, juicy and flavorful.  Try their signature drinks..."}
{"text":"Ein absolutes MUSS in der Stadt ist der Besuch des CN-Towers.

Diesen Besuch kann man sich noch ein Stückerl angenehmer gestalten, indem man einen Tisch im 360° reserviert. Man wird zu einem separaten Eingang geleitet und umgeht die lange Warteschlange am Aufzug. Die Fahrt ist im Restaurantbesuch bereits enthalten. Dies im Hinterkopf ist das Restaurant mehr als nur zu empfehlen.

Zum guten Preis bekommt man hier ein fantastisches Gesamtpaket:

Hervorragendes Essen (Modern-CAN). 
Zuvorkommenden Service.
Eine atemberaubende Aussicht.

Alles in Allem ein rundum empfehlenswertes Erlebnis!

Ich war vor über 10 Jahren das Erste Mal dort und viele weitere Male in der City. Einen Besuch im 360° habe ich stets unternommen. 

Auch ein Abstecher hoch ins SkyPod lohnt!"}
{"text":"Well worth it for the views. Thoroughly enjoyed dinner, though, yes, as many have commented, the food is generally not great. Both the filet and lobster were overcooked. On the other hand, the heirloom tomato starter was amazing. The tomatoes perfectly ripe, flavorful sauce and nice cheese to go with."}
{"text":"Fantastic view of Toronto

Pricey but worth a visit

Food is good, service good, simple menu

Date place for sure"}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here for our anniversary. The views are beautiful especially at night. Very classy and romantic. But that is ALL they can offer. The food was mediocre and it definitely shouldn't be. We were expecting a 5 star meal but I'd give a rating of 2. Come here for the experience and the views but don't expect anything beyond that"}
{"text":"We came here for the prix-fixe dinner. The service was fantastic. We were seated along the window, and had a great view of the city - I'd definitely recommend requesting a window seat for this purpose.

Unfortunately, the food was quite disappointing given the price. We had Caesar salad, salmon, and the roast beef. The salmon was dry, and the roast beef was difficult to chew through.

I don't regret coming here (because of the experience/view), but would caution others to come prepared for a mediocre meal."}
{"text":"Pricey, but the food was very good.  I guess you're paying for the view with the upcharge in prices.  But then again, by making lunch time reservations, we were able to bypass the 1 1/2 hr wait and go straight on up . . . and visit the observation deck after our meal.  We also did not have to pay any additional fee to visit the tourist deck.  The service was friendly but slow.  Kinda nice if you want to linger and enjoy the view, not so convenient if you have an after-lunch meeting to get to."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst \"restaurants in a fancy tall tower\" restaurant. The quality of food is depressingly low. 

Me and my girlfriend took a reservation here at 8 pm and were seated in a table for 2 which was not adjacent to the mirrors. Upon our request we were moved after 45 minutes of wait time to a table near the Windows. This is perfectly fine because they always have a page volume of people to accommodate. I was actually glad that they considered my girlfriends request and moved  us accordingly but then came the sad part.

We took the 2 course pri-fix menu in which she ordered he chicken and I order the salmon. The chicken was dry, hard and felt cooked a long time ago. The salmon was clearly not fresh and the fish overall was below average. I have had much better salmon in restaurants while paying much less.

All in all, I would recommend people to not at all waste their money on the food here. Just come up for the view and leave."}
{"text":"Stop 4 of AlzCon 2k16. (The third one is too boring to review.)
Quite frankly, I hate views, because I am of the strong opinion that anything which someone did not create is not worth my time. 
And they're boring. 
Cities are interesting because of how dense they are with cool, unknown things to find (which is how Pokémon Go managed to take over the world), not because of how pretty the skyline of stupid glass office boxes are. 
The whole crux of 360 Restaurant lies firmly in its turning view, which makes the whole experience almost as uninspired as its godawful name. You see, the view is actually a distraction for the food, which is equally unimportant and terrible. 
Eating the bread is like chewing on cardboard. The rib eye steak (which is obviously cheap in that it's not marbled or fatty and more akin to prime rib) looks and tastes like it was baked instead of grilled, and is woefully unseasoned, with steak sauce left on the side in an unsuccessful attempt to veil laziness with style. Sweet potato fries came with mayo, for some reason. (Dip them in the steak sauce instead, legit.)
This restaurant is my antithesis. You should only come here if you have too much money to spend, and can't be bothered to support good local registrants like La Palette. To complement the food, I recommend bleach. 
Have I mentioned how much I hate views?
1/5"}
{"text":"Worth the money if you're a tourist in Canada. The view is spectacular...but it does take some getting used to because your table is physically moving rather than the building. Have a drink as soon as you sit down!  Hubby had prime rib, and I had prawn and lobster pasta, calamari was our appy (tasty) and peach crumble with sour cream ice cream (Ice cream had it's own unique flavor, but it was good). All in all, it was definitely our most expensive meal, but worth it, your at the top of CN Tower in Toronto!"}
{"text":"The best views! I was concerned about the bad food reviews, but ignore them! The food was great!Glad I went, it was a special evening."}
{"text":"View = 5. Food = 4. Service = 5. Atmosphere = 3 because of all the selfie-takers especially the table of 6 with the selfie stick. Came here for a special celebration. The food was delicious. I had the pumpkin bisque, osso buco and for dessert the white chocolate and cherries and meringues. Our server was chatty and attentive."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service.  My niece have not finished the food and the waiter took it away without asking and he never feel sorry about that, also give me the dessert when I was still working in entree.  Not going back and not recommend to my friend to go."}
{"text":"GOOD:
The view. the restaurant makes a full rotation in a little over an hour. On a nice day, it is absolutely gorgeous. The service is friendly. The food is good, but not as fabulous as the view.

BAD:
If you don't line up before it opens, you might get a seat on the inner ring. The best bet is to be on the outer ring so you don't have obstructions to taking pictures. The price is a bit high, about $75CAD after tip and tax, but you do get access to the observation deck area, not the upper pod.

1-star: I've had hemorrhoids more pleasant than this. 
2-star: I would rather avoid this place. 
3-star: On par with other similar establishments. 
4-star: Will return as often as possible. 
5-star: I refuse to find a better place."}
{"text":"I suppose when you come to Toronto as a visitor, going to the top of the CN Tower gets on your list. The night before we had dinner at Canoe which also boasts great views, albeit not so high, and terrific food.

Bottom line: It is fun but expensive for moderate food. No surprise.

If you go to see tower without dinner it will cost you $30 but free if you have dinner. You'll also cut the long lines.

The service was very friendly. The restaurant rotates once about every 72 minutes. We made it around a few times. You get good views of the city and lake. We found ourselves surrounded by annoying kids and crying babies. I guess that's what you get at a tourist spot.

The food was just okay for what you pay, $300 for the two of us including tip. The bread is pedestrian and accompanied by cold butter. The trio of seafood appetizer is flavorless. The Caesar with bacon was drowning. The lamb with harissa was really fatty and not spicy as I would expect. And so on.

After dinner we went downstairs to the viewing platform, stood on the vertigo-inducing glass floor.

If I were to do it again, I'd go for dinner and limit my food purchases, have a few drinks, and get the view."}
{"text":"2 stars for the food and 5 stars for the view and 5 stars for the experience. It was a breathtaking, roller coaster kinda dinner. The view is so grand! The observatory was scary and fun and the whole dinning experience was unforgettable. It was very touristy but I was ready for that. So just enjoy it."}
{"text":"The best way to visit the CN tower.

My cousin made reservations for my whole family and hers to have an early dinner here on a busy Saturday.  There were eight of us in total and making a reservation the day before didn't seem too hard.  We were glad we did because when we arrived entering the tower was a nightmare.  It was crazy busy.  We were directed right to the front door to security.  Once we took their restaurant elevator up, we were escorted right to the front of the long line of the restaurant bypassing the insane amount of people without reservations.  Reservation is highly suggested!

Once seated we were given their menu and complementary bread and butter.  They had a choice between a two course or three course prix fixe meal.  I think the two course was about $65 and the three course was about $80.  For children, they also have a prix fixe two course menu for $40.  They also had steak and seafood a la carte menu.  I choose to do their two course prix fixe because I did not need dessert.  There were seven appetizer options and eight main choices to choose from.  As my appetizer I went with their Celery Root and Fennel Bisque.  This light soup included smoked scallops, celery, and sprouts.  It was refreshing and delicious.  For my main course I decided on Crispy Perth Country Pork Belly and Seared East Coast Sea Scallops.  This large dish included a beautiful presentation of two perfectly seasoned pieces of pork belly, three delicious scallops topped with king salmon caviar and served with some grains.  I loved it.  The presentation was beautiful.  I definitely recommend it if you love scallops like I do.  I was lucky to also sample a few of their other appetizers and main courses since we went with so many people.  Everything tasted pretty good.  

For the $65 or $80 for a prix fixe meal that includes admission is the only way to visit the tower I think.  For the food, convenience and ambience you will be glad you did.  The service was excellent.  Our waiters were quick with requests and food came out fast.  Drinks were always refilled and we didn't feel rushed or anything although there were so many people in line to dine.  You get an unforgettable view of the city.  And their rotating tower is just amazing.  After you dine there you can take one of their private elevators to check out the other floors for free. You also get the ability to take a more private and much faster elevator that regular admission people do not get access to.  If you see the crazy lines you will be glad you dined here.  Basically we were in and out and got to see everything.  I had a wonderful time here and would recommend dining here if you want to check out the CN tower."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch before I had to rush off to the airport.  The ambiance is great, and the view is fantastic.  I love ambiance, views, etc....and I wasn't disappointed!

The lunch menu was great!  I can't believe how much food we got at such a reasonable price!  The meal was way bigger than I'm used to for lunch, but I would do it again.  The prime rib was yummy (although the chocolate lava cake I ordered was more like a chocolate glacier cake....no trace of heat!)

If you're visiting Toronto I'd recommend it.  Especially since you can also visit the observation levels for free!  (Otherwise you need to pay a separate price)

Overall it was a very enjoyable experience.  I'll come back the next time I visit!"}
{"text":"I think this place gets middling reviews because of the price. Yes, it's relatively expensive by Toronto standards. But the food is very good, and when you consider that you're not only getting an AMAZING view for your meal but also saving the $35 ticket to get to the observation deck (since that's included), it's definitely worth it. Maybe even a good value! We highly recommend it, at least if you don't have small kids (who probably won't appreciate the food)."}
{"text":"I came here for my anniversary and I had a mix experience. We had a window seat and it pretty much made my experience a 5/5. The view was amazing and the atmosphere of the restaurant was great. However for the price of the food I was expecting a little more (not quantity but quality). I don't think our waiter said more than 5 words to us throughout the 2 hours we were there. We decided to get the 2 course meal and have dessert elsewhere and I'm glad we chose that. It was also the first time for me at the CN Tower so it was a great experience to have since it included going to the observatory."}
{"text":"So you want dinner and a view? Perfect you found the right place but honestly speaking for the price I paid the food was not that great. Flavours were all over the place no consistency with the meat and just decent service. At the end of the day you're paying for the service undeniably but it would be nice if the food would match its prices. 
This is the type of place you go once and never go again because it's mainly for the view. 
You will definitely get some brownie points from the wife/girlfriend/fiancé though."}
{"text":"Very romantic and perfect view for a special occasion. They offer a prefix and ala carte menu but not everyone at the table is obligated to do the same thing. Food was good but not great. You dine here for the experience rather than the for the food."}
{"text":"I think you are paying for the beautiful and great view of all the city of Toronto. It's a nice and romantic place, very quiet but the food isn't so good, you have to try the two courses meal to have a table. Food is not incredible, good attention of the staff."}
{"text":"Food and service were both very good. Cheesecake was to die for"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I enjoyed a meal at the 360 Restaurant recently to celebrate a special occasion.

We made a reservation ahead of time, which allowed us to skip all those annoying CN Tower lines and get to the top of the tower in record time (and in an uncramped elevator).

We were seated almost immediately next to a window, which we had requested when making the reservation.

I ordered the $55 prix fixe menu, which covered not only my ride to the top, but a three course meal as well.  I chose their Ceasar salad, cornish game hen, and butter tart with maple ice cream.

The salad was very good.  The ingredients were fresh, and the dressing wasn't overpowering or overdone.  My biggest complaint about this course?  Our waiter was a little on the lurk-y side.  I know we were there for an earlier sitting, and that they would be taking reservations after ours, but coming to check on me four or five times during a single course?  It's a bit much.  My boyfriend had sweet potato fries with a lemon aioli while I ate my salad, and he said they were fresh, sweet, and the quantity was such that it began to justify the hefty price tag.

The cornish game hen was good, if not a bit unforgettable.  It was certainly cooked well, but it was nothing you couldn't get at a street-level restaurant.  The butter tart, however, was fantastic.  The maple ice cream perfectly complemented the flavours, and the candied pecans sprinkled on top were a perfect addition.

All in all, I love this restaurant.  The food and experience makes the price tag feel worthwhile.

The only thing I really hate?  The forced \"photo op\" before you take the elevator to the top.  Why would I want a green screen photo of me \"sitting\" in the restaurant when I can take one myself when I am actually up there.  It felt forced upon us as well, as if we weren't allowed to bypass and just head up to our reservation."}
{"text":"The view was fantastic, but the food was just ok. Please give yourself enough time, because it was a 3hr experience. Way too long. Sat at 1:30pm, didn't leave until 4pm. Loved that the floor rotated  so you definitely got the 360 degree view."}
{"text":"please do not try to under-mind your customer as if he/she is a 5 year old who's never experienced fine dining.  ughhh...i don't mind being educated on stuff i didn't know, but i hate to hear excuses BEFORE food even arrives.

i came with 3 of my coworkers, and none of us left happy.  except the view which really isn't anything unique, everything got on my nerves.  first off, service is just robotic and average at best.  there's no sense of genuine friendliness all around it.  the food isn't exceptional, including the desserts.  we liked the grilled calamari and warm smoked duck which were from the appetizer section, but our main dishes were grossly disappointing.  they had one of the worst dessert menus i've been, not even serving the most basic cakes. on top of that, the price is ridiculously inflated for the portion and ingredients used.  i guess we do pay for the view and ambiance, but again, they are not anything special.

however, what peeved me the most was our waiter's demeanor.  even before my order of pan roasted halibut comes out, he tells me that the fish will be tough and dense.  he says a lot of customers have been complaining about their halibut, and that it is unavoidable due to the nature of the fish.  seriously???  i've had many halibuts in restaurants, and i don't ever recall encounting that issue before.  the dish indeed came out very dry and bland, almost inedible.  well, at least he set my expectations low and shut me up from complaining... 

each customer is expected to order at least one main entree even if he/she is not interested in going down to the viewing deck which is right below the restaurant.  this is a ridiculous policy since the view from the restaurant is the same as the deck.  also, the restaurant revolves, so if you are very sensitive to motion, either drink a lot of alcohol or don't drink at all."}
{"text":"Out for a walk-about for my first time in Toronto, I dropped by the CN Tower for a look and found myself indulging in an afternoon snack from 1500 feet.  

Unexpectedly, the CN Tower had as much security as any international airport.  I had to go through a TSA-like checkpoint and a second verification before getting into the tower.  Once inside, I found it swarmed with Chinese and Indian tourists and found myself immediately nauseated.  Thankfully, there was a hostess stand for the 360 restaurant and I quickly signed myself up for the $65 prix fixe meal to skip the crazy lines for the $35 elevator trip up.  For a meal and peace and quiet, it was a no-brainer.  (Three brazen French students snuck along with the diners to avoid paying for the $35 elevator ride.  Shady.  They were promptly shown the door.)

I got up for the first seating at 4:30pm and had an entire slice of the restaurant to myself.  Just fabulous.  I soaked in the views of Toronto in the afternoon light and marveled at the incredible level of construction activity taking place.  I counted at least 26 active cranes.  

For my meal, I ordered the salmon carpaccio, 16oz prime rib, and lava cake.  It's a heavy meal for any normal 4:30pm, but with the 3 hour time difference from California, I was famished.  The food was surprisingly good, on par with any decent restaurant.  Since I came alone, the meal was a perfect match while I took in the prismatic effect of the setting sun on the city.  By 6pm, the sun had set and the city sparkled below.  Stuffed to the gills by the big meal, I had to leave to join my wife for her dinner meeting at Luma.  

With tax and tip, I tabbed out at $85 Canadian (about $60 US), a great deal for a pre-dinner and a show in the sky."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to come here during our recent vacation to Toronto. We're from the US so we just decided to make reservations online two weeks prior to our trip. We only had two times to choose from, 4:15 and 5:15. We chose the later reservation. 

Upon arriving, after going through security, lines, etc. we were told that it'd be another hour before we'd be seated unless we didn't want a window table. So an hour later, we were seated. We both chose the prix fixe menu, which honestly, is the only sensible option. One main entree is almost the same price as the prix fixe menu. 

We ordered a half bottle of wine, since neither of us are heavy drinkers. Big mistake! Do not order a half bottle of wine, they totally short you. The waiter brought out a decanter of wine and poured us each a glass, leaving maybe 3 oz in the decanter. I'm sorry, but a half bottle of wine is way more than two measy glasses. 

The food was good, I thoroughly enjoyed my salmon appetizer and the maple walnut roulade for dessert was exceptional. My boyfriend's halibut main entree was terrible. Totally dry and tasteless. I've never seen him not finish his plate. 

When we left, just after sunset, I noticed how many empty tables there were. Which irked me that we had to make such early reservations when there were always empty tables available."}
{"text":"First thing to mention .... to those whom complain about it being to pricey !  WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ?  ....Burger King .....This is a landmark tourist destination and like any tourist attraction there will be lines and associated cost !

The view at night is SECOND TO NONE !!!!
The menu is CANADIAN ... featuring the best beef in the world ...ALBERTA ( AAA )  BEEF
The food was Fantastic  !!!
The deserts were decadent

If you are looking for a night out for a special occasion dinner, go to the 360...make reservations and show up after 7pm to avoid the longest lines

If your looking to be a chronic complainer and expect everything for free...May I suggest a street meat cart !!!!"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time this Sunday. Overall not worth the price. 

The view, fantastic. 
Food, below everage.
Service, pretty good.

In my opinion it's worth going there once for the experience. That's about it."}
{"text":"One star for the view. Food sucks here, seriously. I could tell that the food weren't prepared with heart. Food tasted so bad. Salmon was old and dry. Chicken tasted so weird and there's a disgusting smell. Bad experience."}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars firs it gorgeous view and service! Our group had a beautiful time! I recommend the salmon and ask to substitute for mash as a side. The food wasn't incredible and neither were the prices but it's worth the experience hands down. Once in a lifetime."}
{"text":"The only positives about this restaurant is gorgeous 360 view of Toronto (it takes a little over an hour to completely rotate) and the complimentary access to the observatory deck with the purchase of an entree.  The overflowing wine cellar with the glass encased Hennessy Louis XVIII Black Pearl was a nice touch as well.

Other than that, it's not worth the hype.  The boyfriend and I both partook in the $75 pre-fixe menu and we were both extremely underwhelmed.  The amuse bouche wasn't worth the extra $10 over the $65 pre-fixe menu.  My peppercorn steak layed on top of yukon gold mashed potatoes tasted mediocre, even after adding fresh ground pepper on top.  The lemon tart for dessert tasted good... but nothing out of the ordinary.  Each soda/juice refill is at a cost ($4 per refill).  Service was spotty throughout the night and the food took a long time in between each course.

The atmosphere is fancy, but the dress code is casual.  A individual ticket to the CN Tower is about $30 for general admission, so paying an extra for a 3 course meal with a rotating view of Toronto isn't such a bad deal. (Be sure to request a window seat when making your reservation)"}
{"text":"Except the view nothing else is exceptional. The food was pretty ordinary. I went there on a saturday night. It was crowded and service was below par. If you want to see a 360 view of Toronto then it is worth it."}
{"text":"It's a prix fixed menu at $65 for 2, $79 for 3. 
I did the $65 and got the zucchini, and then the lemon chicken. The serving sizes are perfect and can fill you up. They suggest on the menu that you need two $9 sides, don't do it, it's for them to make extra money and you probably won't finish it.

Go in with an open mind and know you'll be spending $100. 

Over all the service was great, and so were the views."}
{"text":"Julie

3 Stars for the View 
1 STAR FOR THE CRAPPY FOOD
averages out to 2 Stars.  Forget that...  Changing it to 1 STAR....

I guess it's a spot to go if you're a tourist or if you want to impress your non-foodie date.....

Went for a $68 prix fixe.... Knew it was going to go bad with the \"Bread Test\"...  Hmmmm, what's the bread test????  Well, if you know that you're going to spend $100 bucks on dinner at a restaurant, they should have pretty good bread, right ???  Well, it Sucked...  Stale, Chewy and old tasting.  Couldn't they at least warm it up????? How hard is that.  Waiters are not too attentive as we sat there waiting for a while before orders were taken.  Other than that, the waiters are bad when providing service as they reach across tables instead of walking around the table.

But on to the food....  This one is a chore...

Started with Amuse bouche which was watermelon with feta cheese.  Ok starter... How do you screw up a bite size piece of watermelon and some cheese.

App was Galantine of King Duck and Foie Gras.....   Horrrrible....  Worse I've ever had.  Tasted like it came out of a can???  What up...  truly terrible.

Entree was Pacific Halibut and Panko Fried Oysters - Oven dried Roma tomatoes, early summer potatoes, lemon aïoli, caper vinaigrette.   Terriblllleeeeee.    Halibut was a rock and the fried oysters tasted worse than a microwave meal.  Tomatoes and potatoes were the only things edible.  Didn't see any capers??? 

Dessert was Berry Shortcake   and sour cream ice cream.  The cake was stale and definitely OLD and HARD. WTFFF????  could not believe it.  The best part of my whole meal was the sour cream ice cream.  

How can this be a restaurant????  Please avoid.   

Go see the view at the observation deck and get a burger at the restaurant on the observation level.  But don't dine at 360...."}
{"text":"I don't know how this got such high reviews. There are wayyyyy better restaurants than this one for the same price. Coming here you got to subtract the ticket price from your meal and that's what you're actually getting. 

Yes the view is lovely and you can get amazing pictures. But the food, I would definitely pass on."}
{"text":"5 stars for the amazing view and getting to skip the ridiculous line to ride the elevator to the top of the CN Tower. 

0 stars for service. 0 stars for food.

In my opinion, this is the type of thing you might do once - and definitely never again. While the view is as amazing as everyone says it is, and that line to get to the top of the CN Tower is hellish, the experience you have to endure to get these perks is pretty awful.

First, let's start with the service. I can't possibly imagine it being more rude. We ordered two steaks and several cocktails. None of it was enough for our waiter. He looked like we had just slapped him in the face when a) we didn't EACH want to order an appetizer (and he was horrified when he realized we wouldn't even be sharing one) b) we opted to share a side (they \"recommend\" 2 per person - 1 was more than enough for us to share). c) we didn't want dessert. Mind you, the bill was still around $180 for 2 people. On top of the weird upsell pressure and general snotty attitude, he also wasn't very attentive and brought us bread at some point maybe a half hour into our meal? It was so awkward.

Now the food. You would think with the way he was pushing us to order more food from the menu its at least something tasty he'd expect us to be satisfied with. This food was almost inedible (save for the mashed potatoes which were very good). I've never had a filet that tasted so bland and tough. I've had better food at McDonalds, and didn't have to spend $50 to get it. My boyfriend, who doesn't eat red meat very often, also ordered a steak, which he thought was OK. When I bit into it I gave him a sad look - it was abysmal. I don't know how they have the gall to charge the prices they do and serve such terrible food. It's truly shocking. 

Bottom line: for first timers and people dining on someone else's dime only. Savor the view the one time - and then never come back."}
{"text":"When you eat at this restaurant you are really paying for the view and not the food. For the price you are paying, you expect it to be decent but they turn out to be horrible. We started off with a seafood platter ($200) and everything tasted frozen. The most disturbing part was that we found a piece of hair on the seafood!!! This should never happen at a fine dining place. For our main, my friend ordered a New York steak and it literally only came with the steak with nothing else. She requested medium rare but it came out to be almost well-done. If you are charging $80 for steaks at a fine dining restaurant, you should never make these mistakes. At the end of our meal, we were pretty upset cause it was just not a good experience. A lot of people told me that the food at this restaurant isn't great, but I didn't expect it to be this terrible. Next time my friends decide to visit Toronto, I would only recommend them to visit the CN tower and not the 360 restaurant. There are more options if you want to a nice view and actually tasty food; for example Canoe. The 2 stars I gave this review is for the view and not the food, the food deserves 0 star."}
{"text":"I don't want to sound like a broken record so I will keep this brief. Dined here tonight for a pal and fellow Yelp'er's birthday. I had the pan seared salmon (entree only with water to drink) as my meal. With tax and tip, I paid $50. Quite expensive for salmon, but you have to consider the fact that you're paying for the entire experience. Service was excellent; out server was very personable and quite attentive. I loved the view of Toronto; since the floor rotates (hence the name!), you get a view of the entire city from each direction. After dinner, we had the opportunity to check out the observation deck along with the glass floor. 

I won't come here everyday, but if I have a visitor from out of town, I think I'll be returning for lunch.

Good for: tourists"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the overall experience however the food was lacking. When you make a reservation at the 360 you also get complimentary access to the CN Tower where you can ride up the glass elevator and take a look at the city from feets above. When I came, I chose the 3 course fixed price meal. For the appetizer I had the carpaccio salad, steak for main and a strawberry meringue for dessert. I thought the salad was bland and lacks seasoning. Once I got to the main, who would have thought you can go wrong with steak. But it happened. I asked for medium rare but instead got medium. I can see that they were extremely busy so I ate it. Would not come here again for the meal, crazy expensive and thought it was alright. None the less, I did enjoy the view and the full experience."}
{"text":"The best dinning view in Toronto. ...that could be the whole review as well as the only super positive.

We had our time booked and arrived earlier as suggested during reservation. As there was no line up, we were at the top almost 15mins earlier. The restaurant was almost empty but they still let us stand there and wait for pretty long time before giving us the table. Strange.

Our server was very nice and polite, but I was but dissapointed with no option of a draft beer. Anyway, can of a beer for 12$ tasted ok.

My appetizer was a terrible pick. I went with the duck pate, but they are using such a strong cheese in it that it tasted really strange. My wife went with salmon and it ws good.

For the main course, we botj went with the 45days aged beef. That one was very tasty. Bug portion of meet, but make sure you don't mind fat if you pick that one.

Overall it was a ok food, but absolutely not worth the $$$. However, the view makes it up and you won't regret paying the final amount on the bill."}
{"text":"LOVED the atmosphere. Definitely make a reservation so you can skip all the long lines like we did. Food and service very average & the price isn't cheap, so don't go if that will ruin it for you."}
{"text":"Five stars for the view, one star for the quality of the food and the price of the food.

Entering the bottom of CN Tower, they made it pretty clear which line was for the 360 restaurant. The lineup to get into the 360 restaurant took about 20 minutes, which was understandable considering that it is just a tower.

We arrived a little earlier than 6:00pm (our original reservation) and many people were there already. We kindly asked the hostess that we wanted window seats and they kindly accommodated. 

Sitting by the window, was an amazing experience as we watched the whole city beneath our feet. Please be careful if you get dizzy easily! When I sat on the side of the table where I was moving backwards (cause it rotates), i felt as if I was going to faint. Switching to the other side felt much better.

The waiter was very nice and introduced the meal for us quite well and how to find where we are sitting if we needed to go to the bathroom. We decided to order some oysters and the prixe fixe meal. The oysters had a bit of sand in them, so I knew they weren't cleaned properly. The meals tasted as though they were re-heated. I realized I was correct when we left because we peered inside the kitchen as they were reheating the food that came up from downstairs. The dessert was the best part, but even then, it was mediocre."}
{"text":"I was absolutely blown away when I came here. Obviously I was expecting good food and service, but it was incredible! I had the bacon ceasar salad, roasted chicken with mashed potatoes, and chocolate lava cake. My god, everything was so delicious, and even though I've had these kinds of meals before, I never knew they could be so good. The server was great and he knew the menu inside-out. Since my family and I had reservations, we didn't have to wait in line because that would have taken forever, as it's quite a busy spot.
I highly recommend that everyone who visits Toronto goes to this restaurant. But be smart and make a reservation!"}
{"text":"You come here for the experience, not so much for the food.  It was my first time visiting the CN Tower and dining at the 360 Restaurant the best way to go about it. If you eat at here, you do not have to pay for admission to the CN Tower. I'm okay with an mediocre meal for a great view.

We made reservations in advance and luckily got seated right next to the window! We came here for dinner and the view was amazing! The ambiance is great as well - very romantic. The waiter told us that if you are there for 72 minutes, the restaurant would have done a complete 360. This is such a breathtaking view, especially during sunset.

We both got the $65 prix fixe (Heirloom Tomato Salad, Caesar Salad, Pan Seared Atlantic Salmon, Citrus Glazed Boneless Half Chicken, Dark Chocolate Tower, and the Mixed Berry Tart). Food was average for the price - it wasn't horrible, but wasn't amazing either.  No complaints really except in my Heirloom Tomato salad I had a bad tomato that wasn't fresh. However, service here was great for us.  Our waiter was very attentive.

Definitely a must see if it's your first time in Toronto!  But I don't think I'll do it again unless I was bringing someone that has never been here before - it's one of those once in a lifetime things you do."}
{"text":"I ate here and thoroughly enjoyed the food and of course the AMAZING view. I would put this on a to-do list of a trip to Toronto.

FWIW I came here for dinner. Eating at the restaurant allows you to bypass the line and you also don't have to pay just to go up in the tower. That in itself is a lot of value. 

Usually restaurants and general 'tourist traps' like this are subpar but I was surprised that the food was actually pretty good. I see a lot of reviews bashing it, but I was impressed by most of what I got. When you take into account you get a really awesome view (its higher than the observation deck) and get to take in the whole city from the comfort of your seat its even more awesome.

I did the prix fixe,
Appetizer:: duck confit salad. This was really awesome, the duck was really tasty and i loved the dressing they used. I'm normally not a 'salad' person but this was awesome.

Salmon entree:: It was pretty good, the salmon could have been a little more juicy but it was still pretty good. The green peas sauce around was kinda not so great (sorta odd taste, hard to describe) but the mashed potatoes and peas underneath where good. Overall it was good.

Dessert:: peach crumble, this was good. I tried this and the lemon poppy custard cake dessert, and the chocolate tower dessert. All were really good.

All in all it was a great experience."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an upscale restaurant, I would highly recommend coming to 360. Make sure to make a reservation ahead of time and be seated by the window! The whole venue slowly rotates so you will get a full view of the city. Unfortunately it was super foggy the day I went to eat here - so make sure you come on a sunny day! With a reservation, you are also able to visit the observation deck after you eat ($35 value).

There is a vegetarian option and extensive drink/wine menu. The service and food is great, especially considering that each entree is around $50. You're essentially paying for the experience of dining at the CN Tower and being able to see the view (best in Toronto). And for $50/person, that is pretty decent."}
{"text":"The food is only worth 2 stars. But since it's better than the other rotating restaurant on top of a giant phallus I've been to (Space Needle), I'm throwing in an extra star. The view really is great and you don't have to wait in line to get in the elevator, so I guess it's worth it."}
{"text":"The best view and great food. Me and my boyfriend were very pleased. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"This one is hard to rate.   You can't beat the views and by-passing the line for the elevator to eat here.   Also, with the elevator ride at $35 or so, and the prie fixe menu being $55 for lunch, really - it's a no brainer to pay the extra $20 to get a meal and a view, no matter how average the food or service is.

Being said that, the food was about average.   I wouldn't say that it was great or out of this world, but we were generally pleased.

What brings this review down the most is the service.   Our waiter was really not very friendly at all, and several times during the meal he blamed it on being so busy. 

We decide to order a bottle of wine to enjoy with our scenic views.   I order off their wine list a 2010 bottle of their house wine.   Now one thing I was impressed with is that they label which wines on the list are corked and which have screw tops.   My wife and I enjoy wine and doing a bit of wine tasting and buy some nice bottles.   Usually screw tops aren't as impressive as corked bottles so we specifically looked for a corked bottle (they had plenty on the menu).   The waiter brought out a 2011 bottle of the house wine with a screw top.   Before he twisted it open, I said that's not what we ordered.  He began to argue with me saying it was.   I asked him for the menu and pointed out to him the difference.   He said it's all the same.   I refused that bottle and ordered a different bottle.   He comes back about 10 minutes later and says they are out of that wine.     I said never mind, no wine for us.   Then he made a comment that we refused a bottle that we had ordered - I said, no - you brought us a different bottle that was listed.    Overall - just a poor experience."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but really pricy.. well, they include the elevator fee already there, so take it as 1 shot for 2 places to visit, CNT Glass floor and a good/romantic Lunch/Dinner..

I suggest you to look at their menu in their website before booking and also book 1-2 days before.

Overall.. Good view.. good food.... mmmm and good view lol"}
{"text":"Go here for the view.  In about an hour, the revolution is complete and you will have seen Toronto from above.  On a clear day, you can't see forever, but you can have the most magnificent view of Toronto imaginable. What a great way to begin a vacation and get an overview of where you will visit. You will need a reservation for the restaurant. If you can make it for dinner and watch the beautiful sunsets, do it.  Very nice.  For the price of a prix fixe meal, the elevator to the top is included.  Note: If you just went up to the top, it would cost you half as much, so the meal option is a good deal.  I must warn you -- the food however, is mediocre, tourist fare.   I'm not sure this restaurant could do any better as they are catering to an international audience and must have standard menu items - chicken, steak, seafood.  If fact, I'm wondering how they serve as consistently good food as they do to 500+ diners each evening?  But they seem to. The Ling Cod was really good. I thought the Rabbit had too much mustard sauce. The pineapple dessert was alright. The wait staff was hurried and not  attentive at all.  The noise level was low, so a conversation with your table partner is relatively easy. Just remember, you are going there for the view -- not the meal.  So a 5 for the view and a 2 or 3 for the food = 4."}
{"text":"I visited Toronto about a year ago, and my amazing cousin's took my mom and I to dinner at this restaurant and the view was just amazing.  I'm giving 4 stars mainly for the view, the Prix Fixe meals were \"meh.\"  What's not to love when you're 100 stories off the ground!

Food: I had a salad, chicken, which was a little dry but overall edible, and a chocolate dessert.  The food was decent overall, enough to fill me up.

What amazed me most was the view! The view is honestly to die for.  I was able to watch the sunset as we revolved around, and it was gorgeous!  I enjoyed watching the planes take off and land, and the ability for my cousins to point out special locations for me, since I was a tourist.  This almost made up for the mediocre meal I had.

Note: You should note what table you sit at, if you do use the washroom.  The dining area revolves, but the washrooms do not. So it would be a good idea just to remember where your table is located at. :)"}
{"text":"5 star view, 3 star meal. The view is clearly to die for. Food, not so much. We ordered from the fixed menu: 2 course meal for $69 or 3 course meal for $76, but something tells me the food from the regular menu was just as mediocre. The floor rotates slowly while you're eating to give you a 360 view of Toronto. It takes approximately 72 min to make one complete turn. We were hesitant to go because it had been raining all day, but it eventually cleared up and was still an amazing experience! Not to mention, you get free admission (which would be a $25 ticket) to the glass floor and outside deck area, which is nice to see after dinner."}
{"text":"Nice place for important guests to Toronto. Nice view is superb, nice staff, ticket to cn tower is included, fast track to the restaurant so can't complain anything.

Prix Dixie menu, choose the normal ones: salmon, pork, chicken, prim ribs, chocolate cake, etc. they change the lamb shank from the main courses to pasta with little pulled lamb meat, which is a huge disappointment for DH since he had the lamb shank before and it tasted so delicious.

Well, we all loved the view, will take my parents and important friends back there again."}
{"text":"having visited (and in some cases, lived) in enough cities with tall towering landmark structure where you can either get ripped off by the admission fee or by overpriced and underwhelming food and drinks, i would've thought the hub's BFFL would have steered away from the restaurant on top of the CN Tower.  Why? Cos (1) these places are by default tourist traps and locals would rather starve then fork out the amount of money they are charging for sub-par food and drinks and (2) these guys' better not be scammin' the hub because they really are BFFL in the traditional sense (L in this case being since grade 3).

But they did suggest the 360 Restaurant, and I didn't wanna be the diva and judge on something i've never had before.  so i kept my expectations low and followed along.  

Sure enough the whole thing at the beginning felt like deja vu: the security check, the lines at the elevators, the cheerful guides in uniform, the mandatory picture-taking in front of the green screen for the usual chroma keying exercise, and of course the too-fast elevator up the tower shaft (the only difference was the entire elevator was freaking out when realizing that the floor that they were standing on was transparent and they could see the ground rushing away from them as the elevator ascended).

Everything was pretty much like any other top-of-the-skyscraper restaurants until I saw the massive wine cellar - apparently the world record holder for the tallest wine cellar in the world, and full of non two-buck-chuck wines.  some of those ports date back to 1970's.  don't ask how much they cost - if you have to ask then you can't afford it.  

Then i started noticing that the menu is a bit more expansive, the service was much better, and neither the bread nor the butter was not stone-cold.  The hub and I shared a 1-lb rack of lamb, a 10-oz NY cut (rare), fries with truffle aioli and sauteed mushrooms.  they were fantastic.  like i-would-come-back-again-and-pay-that-kind-of-money fantastic. 

Once we got the food, the wine and the service right, the rest of the night just went beautifully.  The view was definitely what ppl went there for - 360' view of Toronto.  I couldn't care much for the south view - vast expanse of dark Lake Ontario water (and, as if on cue, the AC in that part of the building is much colder than the rest), but I definitely appreciated the tall, recognizable landmarks of the amazing city to the north of the tower.

Now if only the temperature wasn't 36C (with humidex) in the summer and -15C in winter time, I would probably consider living here."}
{"text":"Was super excited to come to the CN Tower with my family to unfortunately have an OK experience. Our server Paul (aka Paulo) was pretty rude when first arriving, which ultimately made the entire theme of our lunch but we think he lightened up at the end. Food was great, though the choices of only having a 2 or 3 course meal was limiting for those who can only eat certain things (my mom has a weak stomach). Over all, I went and saw the CN Tower and enjoyed the experience but it's something to do once every 10+ years I would say for the price."}
{"text":"A landmark restaurant, a no brainer choice for special occasions. The food is nothing great home about but then the view makes up for it all. It's the whole experience of going to the restaurant situated at such a great height, overlooking the skyline of Toronto. I have been to the 360 4 times and the view has always been spectacular. Evening around 7 pm is a good time to go in summers so that one can get to see the view both during sunlight and sunset."}
{"text":"Let's be honest here, folks. You don't go to 360 for the food. You go because:

a. The view is amazing
b. The purchase of an entree at 360 allows you to bypass the long lines downstairs
c. All of the above

The food, then, in an afterthought. Sure, it's nicely plated and served in the style of fine dining, but the food is strictly wedding-banquet fare. My prix fixe lunch ($48) entree of stuffed chicken breast was slightly bland and rather dry, served with the obligatory mashed potatoes and overcooked broccolini. My heirloom tomato and mozzarella salad starter was pretty, but served with underripe tomato. My dessert, the maple walnut roulade, was nice (if a little too sweet for my taste). Portions are large, so even if the food isn't the greatest, you will leave pretty stuffed.

But everything outside of the food was good -- the server was very attentive and friendly, and of course the view can't be beat. All in all, it's a great place to take your tourist friends to spend a few hours taking in a birds-eye view of Toronto without having to wait in line with the rest of the hoi polloi. ;)"}

What I had:
The Caesar Salad
Salmon
Apple Pie with Ice Cream

Overall, the meal was good. I liked the pancetta in the salad, it was a nice touch. The salmon was cooked pretty well. The dessert was probably the highlight for me, and I would highly recommend it.

Overall, the meal was enjoyable because of the view and the company. But the food just did not stand out, especially considering that this is the restaurant found in the CN Tower.

Great for the view, nice place to eat at at least once."}
{"text":"The food is definitely expensive - no two ways about it. The taste is above average - their peppered steak is very tasty but not much to write about for the lamb chops. 

The wine collection, on the other hand, is fantastic. 

This place is NOT for vegetarians. They have a pre-fixe menu for vegetarians but that's about it. The main incentive of choosing this restaurant over other similar priced restaurant is the complimentary viewing. But when you have literally one choice in vegetarian option, it really is inconvenient unless you forgo the complimentary viewing. 

Anyway - after two visits here, it's safe to say I might be done with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Save your money, see beautiful Toronto from CN Tower and skip the restaurant. The food is pretty bad especially considering the prices. Yes the view is breathtaking. We ordered two Curried Baby Eggplant dishes and got penne pasta for the kids. At $40 the pasta was your regular white pasta with no sauce. It was oily, dry and gummy with no flavor. Eggplant dish was horrid with the whole thing tasting like a shoe dunked in oil. All an all $257 after, we left unimpressed. At least the side of sweet potato fries were somewhat enjoyable."}
{"text":"I've found restaurants up high rarely rate correspondingly, doubly so  those towers built 30+ years ago.  However, this is an exception.  

For a coworkers big 3-0, we headed up for the first time to hit two birds with one stone scoring the free \"elevation\" with reservation.  

The drink menu was the first surprise, a choke inducing overpriced wine list.  However, the cocktails were reasonably priced in complete contrast to most sky high lounges.  $6 or 7 for a whiskey in the sky; of, course I'll try.  

On a Tuesday night, it wasn't busy, window tables were taken save a few, but no others.  There were several mid 20s on dates, several business groups and several obvious tourists.  

The prix fixe's are around 55 to 68 but I went with the mustard encrusted lamb, side of gigantic mushrooms and some dark chocolate truffles for desert.  Ran about $75 a person total.

My colleague had a 16 oz steak that looked more at home on Fred Flinstone's plate or Dr. Seuss's roast beast.

Of course the rotation novelty is fun for a first time, more than a few people were trying to put pepper shakers on the window sill to time the 72 minutes around."}
{"text":"Service was indescribably bad! From the beginning of the night the server was just rude. Expensive and not worth it ."}
{"text":"First off, I have to say the pictures of the food looked better than it appears.  The food seriously looks like cheap casino food.  You know the casinos that advertises as you're driving towards Vegas- $9.99 for prime rib.  I know you guys know what I'm talking about.  The cocktail drink I ordered did not look appealing and it didn't taste that great either.  When, I came here I was well aware of the rating. It was 3.5 stars, so it can go either ways. The only saving grace for this place was the view.  The view was phenomenal. The restaurant rotated 360 degrees, hence the name of the restaurant.  The restaurant has so much potential and it needs to be revamped with new bartenders and new chefs. We initially wanted to do the 3 course meal, but when we got our entree, we changed our mind and decided to get the 2 course meal and skip out on the dessert.  The dinner was pricey and it was not worth it.  The dinner will actually buy a pass to enter the observatory, which you can get a view of the city.  Also, you get to go to the glass floor, which isn't for the faint of heart, if you're afraid of heights.  

The service was great.  Our server was attentive.  

As far as parking, it's downtown and it's a pain to find parking.  We ended up just Ubering there.  

Would I come back here?  Absolutely not!  Please get new bartenders and chefs."}
{"text":"If you've been up the CN Tower, you should also try the restaurant!
The food received for the price was good value in my opinion. 
I tried the set menu, and was impressed with the quality of the food. There was enough to take home!
I particularly enjoyed the appetizer of smoked salmon, as well as the dessert.

Go on a non-cloudy day so you can view the sunset as you slowly make your rotation! It's a unique experience to be able to see the city from all angles, and see planes landing/lifting off.

Service is attentive and there is lots of seating. You do not feel rushed.

Overall a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Comer en este restaurante es una experiencia increíble. Es una de esas cosas que uno tiene que marcar en su lista de logros viajeros. 

Empecemos por el ambiente. El 360 es uno de los dos restaurantes en la torre CN. Se llama 360 porque es giratorio. Sí, comés de lujo y ves todo Toronto desde una plataforma giratoria... ¿no es genial? No hace falta decirles que reservar una mesa en la ventana es casi obligatorio. La vista es espectacular.

Ventajas: cuando analicen sus opciones de visita a la torre, se van a dar cuenta que si quieren comer en este restaurante, lo conveniente es comprar un menú \"prix price\" para poder acceder al LookOut y el Glass Floor después de salir del restaurante. Además, la torre es famosa por sus colas de turistas. Si reservan en el restaurante, pasan derecho y solo tienen que esperar en las instancias de seguridad (con un guardarropa para dejar el abrigo). 

El restaurante tiene mucha clase y la comida es gourmet. Los platos están bien. Lo mejor es que son bastante completos. Se imaginarán que es un restaurante caro, pero vale la pena.

Si deciden reservar, háganlo estratégicamente en una hora que les permita después poder disfrutar del LookOut y el Glass Floor. Calculen aproximadamente 1.30 h para estos sectores."}
{"text":"Service could be better as the wait staff seems rushed and very stiff. Food was great! And the view.... Let me put it this way gentlemen, if you absolutely positively need to get laid, come to the 360 during sunset. :)"}
{"text":"Like many others, I broke down my review as such:
Food - 3.5
Views - 5
Service - 5
Uniqueness - 5

So, I'm a fan.  Obviously, eating atop a giant tower in a revolving restaurant will inflate food and drink prices a bit.  There are two- and three-course meal options available and a la carte selections.  The meal options are a way better deal because you get similar (or the same) entree with additional food.  The three-course menu was $79CAD per person (about $60US per person).  Drinks were $5-$10US, so typical of a restaurant/bar.  Some of the cocktails were a bit pricier but also fancier so you get what you pay for.  

I enjoyed my soup (yellow tomato and corn gazpacho) and baked ziti with wild mushrooms.  There weren't a ton of mushrooms in the entree, but the ziti and chili sauce were delicious.  My husband got the aged ribeye entree and really enjoyed it.  It was a little too rare (even though he ordered medium rare) so maybe make sure they cook it medium throughout and not just one section of the cut.  Since they served bread before the meal, I filled up on a bit too much of that (there was some waiting between app and entree) so I almost couldn't finish my dessert.  I had the sorbet which was delicious and my husband had ice cream and cookies, which he loved.  The homemade fig newton was yummo.   

Obviously, the view is excellent.  It takes 72 minutes for the restaurant to make one full rotation and they seem to have dinner timed pretty well to coincide with that revolution.  We basically ended where we started (a little later) so we were only up there for like 90 minutes.  Even though there are a lot of people, it didn't seem too loud and our server was funny and there whenever we needed him.  

We actually witnessed a proposal in their wine cellar which was super cute and the couple was obviously ecstatic.  This was a great place to spend our 5th wedding anniversary.  We enjoyed the views, the bar below was quick and not super full while we waited for our reservation time, and our dinner came with complete access to the two levels of viewing decks, including the glass floor.  We spent a bit of time down there after the meal and really enjoyed ourselves, even though it was still crowded for 11 p.m. Reservations are easy to make on their website so make sure you do that because it seemed like 95% of the tables were reserved when we arrived at 9 p.m."}
{"text":"You come here for the view, but the food and service were just fine.  Everyone should try this place, on a clear day, once.

Your admission to the CN Tower is free with your restaurant reservation, which slightly diminishes the sting of the expensive menu prices."}
{"text":"As tourists, we HAD to go to 360 Restaurant at least once! The view from here is spectacular, and the service is great. The food was good, and the wine selection was top notch, but the price is definitely inflated due to the location. If you're doing Toronto the tourist way, you have to give this place a try at least once."}
{"text":"I see a lot of low star reviews here  concerning the food so I can only imagine that the place has fallen off in recent years.  I went a couple years ago and found the food to be very expensive, which is expected for the venue, but I remember that I had a really good meal there.  

The view is amazing and unparalleled in the city, so despite the bad food it might be worth a trip for the night time view"}
{"text":"Right when we got off the plane we came here after the touring around the CN Tower.

You cannot deny the view from up here!
I just wished the food was as good as the view.

There was an image of the TRIO OF ATLANTIC SEAFOOD COCKTAIL within the menu.
Immediately C and I were like wooo hooo!
It was Jumbo lump crab, maritime lobster, sweet rock shrimp
Champagne vinaigrette, tarragon aioli, horseradish cocktail sauce

The jumbo lump crab cocktail tasted like the canned crab meat that you purchased at Whole Foods.
Maritime Lobster was okay but the meat could have been a bit more firm.
The sweet rock shrimp tasted raw - I had an issue with the texture of this cocktail.

C and I both got the ATLANTIC LOBSTER AND GULF SHRIMP OMELET as our entree.
Steamed asparagus, Brie cheese, Yukon frites, truffle aioli
I asked the waiter to substitute my Yukon frites for a Sour Cream & Chive Baked Potato.

I haven't had a Baked Potato for so long that I was ecstatic to eat it!  
But my baked potato came with nothing...not even BUTTER!

I had to ask the waiter for the Sour Cream and the Chives but they didn't help with the flavouring since my Baked Potato was undercooked!

I was so disappointed but I didn't bother sending it back since I was with guests and so I ended up just eating only the lobster meat from my omelet.

I am not a fan!

*sigh*

Besides Crawfish...Lobster is my favourite kind of meat!"}
{"text":"So, you want to see Toronto. Like all of it. But you think $40 just to go up to the top of CN Tower is steep. Hey, why not go to the restaurant? The price includes the Observation Deck and Glass Floor.

We did, and bypassing the line was worth the reservation. This review will cover three things - food quality, experience, and value.

The food - we had the Prix Fixe, two courses each. My wife ordered the gazpacho and I had the chowder. Neither were anything to write home about. For entrees, my wife had the cod three ways and I had the Alberta prime rib. My wife said the cod was okay in two of the three, and very good on one - the only one she thought tasted fresh. The prime rib was... Ordinary? It was obviously prepared with wine, but that wine flavor masked anything I could have gotten from the meat itself. The potatoes that accompanied were creamy, and flavored with horseradish, which felt appropriate for the meal. I enjoyed them.

We were surprised with a complimentary dessert, a function of this being our anniversary dinner. More on the surprise in a moment, but the dessert itself, a chocolate tower, was quite good!

The experience, overall, was good. The wait staff was extremely courteous and professional. Our server was totally great, and though I know some will cringe at the idea of crediting staff with the thoughtfulness of a complimentary dessert, we were genuinely surprised. My wife even joked about it earlier in the meal. 

We were seated at a window, and the view, of course was spectacular. Worth noting, the windows were clean and clear, and it was a great place to take periodic pictures as the restaurant revolved. We found the observation deck and glass floor to be far less photo-friendly, so if you want good pictures, the restaurant is the better choice. We did not view the sky deck, so I can't comment on that.

Value - if the ride to the observation deck and glass floor is around 40 bucks, the restaurant is worth the additional cost solely to avoid the lines and get better views through cleaner windows. The staff is a friendly as they come, and while the food isn't as good as we'd like, that's frankly not why anyone would dine here.

Bottom line - if you want to see Toronto from CN Tower, dress up a bit, make reservations and come to the restaurant. It'll cost more, obviously, but the experience will be better than simply hitting the two lower decks alone. We both agreed that we would have been disappointed in that experience given the cost, whereas the restaurant experience seemed more appropriate."}
{"text":"It's all about location. Food was mediocre and over priced considering it wasn't even cooked properly. It's an experience everyone should have once, just don't expect it to be overwhelmingly good."}
{"text":"Worst food I've ever had. Bread was cold, salmon was dry and hard, tenderloin was overcooked."}
{"text":"This place had wonderful food, though it was definitely pricey. But really, you're paying for the view. The view was spectacular. I know it's touristy, but for your first time in Toronto, it's a great place to stop and enjoy a great meal while seeing the city!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I gotta admit I didn't pay for my dinner so that may have skewed my perception a bit.  

Now that we got that over with, I gotta say I probably would have paid to eat here anyway.  As a fine dining restaurant alone, I thought it was decent but not wow.  However, the view (and overall experience) is definitely worth  the $$$.

Our group got here pretty early so we got a chance to hang out at the CN Tower observation deck and glass floor area for a while.  That costs over $20 alone so I think that does help justify the costs a little bit...plus it's nice that we get to skip the long line you would usually have to take if you were doing the tower only.  Since some people in our party have dined here a bunch of times before, our reservation was timed perfectly so we got at least two full revolutions to go around and see the view when it was still light out, then saw the sunset and nighttime lights (even a couple lightning bolts).

As far as the food, I was pretty happy with what I got.  I started with the bruschetta, which was decent, then had the filet rossini which was very tasty (they were also pretty generous w/ the foie gras).  Chocolate tower dessert was kinda meh, but I was ok w/ it since I was pretty full by the time we got to it anyway.  As a fine dining restaurant, it's nothing special, and I've had as good or better before, but at least their portions are huge, so at least you get your money's worth.  The staff was very friendly and had some good recommendations when I asked about local wines.

I would probably come back here again, especially if I'm on an expense account!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday for lunch. I like that even though it was crowded they have priority lines for you to get on an elevator up to the restaurant. Gorgeous views of Toronto, can't beat this restaurant view! Service was pleasant. Food was good too. I had the soup, pork belly and chocolate lava cake and enjoyed it all. It was expensive but it's the premium you pay for the setting. I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Is it expensive? Yes. 
Is the food of good quality and delicious? Yes. 
Do you have an amazing 360 degree view of Toronto? Yes!

My sister and I came here on a Saturday night with plans to just walk in and dine. We didn't realize you had to \"make a reservation\", however apparently that wasn't difficult to do as a walk-in at 6pm. We felt that eating at the CN Tower would be worth it especially since we'd get to dine with the 360 degree of Toronto and not have to just pay a fee to check out the view on their observation deck (which is included in your meal price). 

We both decided to order the prime rib with different salads to start. I had the zucchini watercress salad which was really refreshing. I loved the fresh ingredients, although I was hoping for a more hearty salad. The prime rib was cooked perfectly and paired well with their mashed potatoes and asparagus. I thought the food was cooked very well and made with fresh ingredients. It was really worth the price to have such a delicious meal while enjoying the view of Toronto. We actually got to start our meal with the sun setting and finished with the city lit up. A wonderful experience, in my opinion, but if you hone in on the price you may not agree. But for me, the experience and food were worth it. I definitely recommend 360 Restaurant to those who are just in town visiting the area because it gives such an amazing view of Toronto."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner at the 360 restaurant. Going round in circles was surprisingly good fun for me. Especially while the sun slowly set and the view was different on every rotation. There was even a thunderstorm to whiteness in the distance. Just awesome. 
I had the seafood sampler and the prime rib, and both were very good. But the other real highlight was our waiter George. He was Michelin class. This professional attitude mixed with gentle humour was delightful. We will remember him most of all."}
{"text":"Be prepared to be underwhelmed by the food, but that's not really why you're here. The views were one of a kind, and that's what makes this place. Absolutely with it, memorable meal."}
{"text":"The view is definitely the best part of the whole visit.  If you get motion sickness, you'll definitely want to avoid this restaurant. Food was just OK. The scallops appetizer was a little bland for my taste. Wife had to send back the pork chops because they were way to smokey.  Beef short ribs were pretty good."}
{"text":"The rotating restaurant above the city is the epitome of fine dining in the city. 

Two and three course meals are the easy way to go with a variety scintillating dishes. I loved the lemon tart with a wonderful scoop of blackberry sorbet.

If you have 6 or more guests there is 15% gratuity add to your bill. 

Bucket list, check. Something to do once in your life."}
{"text":"What a beautiful spot to have dinner as you sit on the highest point and rotate around while dining.

Very $$$ but well worth it!  I had the Caesar to start--was OK, more iceberg lettuce than it should have been. It also had huge chunks of bacon on it (not a complaint at all!)  For my meal, I had the 10 oz. prime rib--HUGE and delish! I substituted the bread pudding for a baked potato.  Only complaint, plate was too small. I didn't been discover my green beans until I was half way through the steak!

I had a very delicious Pinot Noir and a French Kiss martini--but warning the cocktails were VERY pricey.

Apparently it takes 72 minutes to get all the way around, and if you're dining in, it's a slow, pleasurable experiences, so you'll definitely get all the way around once.  We went around sunset too so got to see daylight, sunset and night which was awesome.  Huge bay windows allow for some great photo ops of sailboats and the city.   An entree purchase gets you a \"free\" pass to a few floors down to the observation deck too.

Overall, a really cool, worth it, one-time experience.  TIPS:  Notice where the bathroom is as you go around--you may not see it for awhile! Also, if you're hesitant about the price, think of it this way...just going to the observation deck costs like almost $40.  A steak is $45.  So go eat and see what you came to see!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Toronto, Canada and we dined here while our stay, The view is amazing!!!! 

I can say It was worth the price, when you purchase any entree it allows you access the downstairs floor view. 

The food was good for what it is, I liked the prix fix menu option they had. 

We made reservations which you can do easily online and we got sitted right away. 

I enjoyed the fact that they do not rush you, we were there for approximately 3 hours and we did enjoy the 360 view in  72 minutes of Toronto :)"}
{"text":"The only good thing about this restaurant is that you can skip the longest line to get to the top of the CN tower. But actual restaurant is nothing worthy of the money spent here. 

Its unfortunate that chefs are absolutely not creative, I only tasted my main dish and could not even imagine to have another bite. If you think that getting pre-fix menu would be savings - don't. 

If I am to rate the food - its 1 STAR
If I am to rate service - 2 STARS 
If I am to rate the place - they do offer fantastic views so here you go 5 STARS

If you are there just to cut the line to the observation deck - opt out for the one main course. 

My feeling about this place is that they dont' even try..... plenty of tourists to get by.... very sad..."}
{"text":"Changing my review since the last one from a few years ago. Mediocre service from the server. Mediocre food. Requested special chocolate plaque to be made for dessert through the Open Table reservation website...Did not follow through. Still a spectacular view from the restaurant and better service from the guys who provide the bread and water."}
{"text":"So fun! Paid for the view more than the meal.

To go straight up to the restaurant means partaking in the $50 prix fix for lunch. That was worth it. Me and my good friends from AAN just hung out at the top of Toronto eating a well made meal,

Pickerel. It is like a perch. That was done nicely."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!! Seriously probably one of the best restaurants we went to on our trip. Our waiter Paul C was incredible. He made the experience worth while with his professional photography skills, great recommendations and personality. The price is expensive, but not when considering the price to just go see the view (about $40 per person). A meal for 2 is half the price of just being allowed to see the view in the observatory deck. The line for the restaurant is separate for the view, which is no where near as long but definitely make a reservation first. We were lucky to just walk in when it said it was booked online so definitely give that a try if nothing else is available."}
{"text":"It was a pleasant experience despite the meal it's just regular, nothing special indeed. But as you surely are there for the whole experience (and the price to go up there makes compensate to reserve a table over there) it is really worth, mainly due to staff and service that were perfect."}
{"text":"Worth every penny (and it is a lot of pennies!) The service was excellent and we didn't feel rushed. The views were amazing even in a partly cloudy evening. Our group of four would recommend the gnocchi, veal osso buco, beef tenderloin, salmon, pumpkin soup, beet salad and the cheese course. They were out of the wine we selected and made a suggestion for alternative and gave us a tour of the wine cellar. Would return again."}
{"text":"Amazing view, food was great.. I ordered the bison steak.. which tasted very good and was very tender. For appetizer we had oysters, which were very fresh. The service was very slow but our waiter made up for it by hooking us up with a tasty dessert. A bit pricey tho"}
{"text":"When you make reservations to 360 you get a free pass to tour the tower.

The food was great and the cocktails strong.  The cocktails came with the booze and mix separated which i really like.  The bread was awesome and everything we ate was prepared well and served appropriately.  We took our time at dinner and enjoyed the views.  We had an appetizer of smoked fish that was amazing."}
{"text":"I would probably give the restaurant a 3 star, but I'll give it a 4 for the view.
Wanted to check out the view at the CN Tower but the lineups were too long for tickets so we decided to grab lunch at the 360.
The steak was alright, probably slightly above average, but lacked some taste. Their salmon was a bit too creamy for my taste (probably because of the sauce). Though I must say the view really made up for the slight disappointment we had for our meal!"}
{"text":"Expensive, but everyone already knows that based on the elevation, view, and \"free\" access to the observation deck.  You also skip the lines and pretty much head straight up upon arrival.

The food was great.  I started with the romain salad, then splurged on the filet (cooked properly) with half-lobster (in the shell, but pulled out enough that I didn't need to use my fingers for anything).  Finished it off with apple crisp covered with \"sour cream ice cream\" (tastes much better than it sounds), and a whimsical puff of cotton candy.

The staff was attentive and professional.  A full rotation lasts the duration of a casual meal, allowing tremendous views all around."}
{"text":"Yes, it is undeniably the best view of Toronto you'll ever encounter, but for the money, not nearly the best restaurant.

I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at 360, but was never blown away. In fact, my $85.00 steak with Foie Gras was not up to par. Also- the portions are way too huge for the Canadian appetite.

All that being said, its the perfect place to wow your date or impress your out -of-town relatives. The view is worth some of the restaurant's shortcomings. Bring your wallet and your patience and you'll have a nice time."}
{"text":"I came here because of a special occasion to celebrate my parents' anniversary. The view from the top of the tower was magnificent. I loved how the restaurant rotates so I was able to get a different view of Toronto   every time I looked out. We came in the evening before the sunset so we got to see Toronto during the day as well as its night line--like a two-in-one deal! Overall, I would say the best part of this restaurant experience starts and ends with its view. 

Foodwise, with the cost of each dish, I sort of expected a higher and better quality. To start, the grand seafood platter was sort of disappointing as the lobster and clams were overcooked. I had the smoked mushroom and onion soup as my appetizer and it tasted pretty bland; I could not detect any smokiness flavour at all. My main dish was the cod fish and shrimp, which was alright, but I wish the overall dish was less soupy(?!) because it felt more like an appetizer than an entrée. As for dessert, I loved the lavender ice cream, the flavour was spot on! We also got a complementary dessert because of my parents' anniversary and the orange chocolate was delicious! However, the crème brûlée was a complete disappointment; the top, which is suppose to be a nice thin sugar crust, was flimsy and soft. What makes a crème brûlée A CRÈME BRÛLÉE is the fact that I can crack the top with my spoon!! What they served me was just custard! I do not recommend ordering this dessert. 

Service, again with the cost of each dish, I expected a more courteous and attentive waiter. Instead, my waiter and his helper was rude. I had to wave my hands like a crazy lady to get his attention a few times to get refills on our drinks and bread. I am just thankful that I did not come with a party of 6 because then, I'll have to pay the obligatory gratuity in my bill. 

Would I return? Maybe for a special occasion..."}
{"text":"An excellent choice to celebrate a very special occasion, in my case, both a wedding anniversary and my birthday.

TIPS to maximize your experience

- Check the weather forecast and plan to go on a sunny, clear day.
- Make a reservation and ask to be seated right next to the window so you will have an unimpeded view of the city and Lake Ontario.
- Go during the week before sunset so you can take in the gorgeous panoramic view as it turns from day to night. Plan to stay at least 2 hours for maximum viewing pleasure.
- Take LOTS of pictures to chronicle your adventure.
- Arrive early (there is a security check point with a metal detector and the security guards will search all purses and backpacks) and ask to wait down below in the observation decks. You can go down to the indoor and outdoor observation decks before and after your meal. Make sure to stand on the glass floor (section) and look down to get a perspective on high you are.
-Order the prix fix meals if you're looking for the best bang for your buck. I had the West coast Foraged Mushroom Chowder (say \"yes\" to the fresh ground pepper), Prime rib cooked medium (ask for horse radish on the side and extra marrow au jus) and the Dark Chocolate Delice with Preserved Gooseberries, Coffee mousse, and rum crème fraîche (tastes better when you eat all the components together). 
-If you don't like anything on the prix fixe menu an excellent choice a la carte is the Bison Tenderloin (medium rare) 8oz with Warner's Farm black currant and chili jus, black walnut and parsnip purée, and West coast black trumpet mushrooms: tender and delicious, not gamey at all but you must eat it while it's warm.
-Let them know at the beginning of your meal if you're celebrating a birthday or anniversary and you'll get a complimentary dessert; ours was the Warm Caramel Apple Crisp with Sour Cream Ice Cream, Green apple floss (cotton candy YUM!), and praline grains. I liked this one better than the Dark Chocolate Delice.
- Remember your section number so you know how to get back to your table after you use the washroom. The restaurant rotates but the washrooms do not.
- Visit the the the gift shop on the first floor to pick up an overpriced souvenir or just take pics with all the bear and moose statues (some are even dressed as Mounties) for a momento.
- As you leave the tower, take a look up and watch the light show as the tower changes colors at night.

Shout out to Lisa our exceptional waitress who helped make our dinner memorable with her impeccable service."}
{"text":"Came here as a group of 3 on a Saturday at around 11am and it wasn't too busy yet, much to our surprise.  I got a prix fixe with a mushroom bruschetta, a leg of lamb, and a pecan tart.

The leg of lamb was wonderful, much to my amazement, as I'd never eaten that portion of the lamb before; it was paired wonderfully with potatoes.  The highlight of the meal was definitely the pecan tart. It came with a scoop of ice cream and dried berries on the side, and the sauce was tangy and sweet - a spectacular end to the meal!

The other two split a 2-tier seafood platter with raw oysters, salads, lobster tails, shrimp and salmon. Although the menu lists it as an ideal appetizer for two, it was well enough to be a main course for two!

Overall a great view and wonderful experience, the service as the beginning of the meal really wasn't phenomenal as the seating took a while to figure out.  We were also seated near a \"dish station\", so often there was staff unloading plates in that general area, which wasn't great in terms of noise."}
{"text":"I didn't think their food was too bad, however a bit pricey. We spend roughly $200.00 on two people (2 course meal, one modestly priced bottle of wine). I did not like that they allow people to make a reservation for 10pm and then rush them to order. Sorry 360, but that is poor service in my opinion. If I am sitting down to enjoy my meal and (based on your high prices) am going to spend close to $200 bucks, do not tell me that I need to hurry up because the kitchen is closing. Either stop letting people reserve that late or don't rush your customers."}
{"text":"The CN tower restaurant was a delightful dining experience. I came for a birthday celebration with friends and we all enjoyed every single dish. The waiters and waitresses were very professional and made sure we were taken care of. I will be returning for Winterlicious!!"}
{"text":"This will be my first and last time being at the restaurant. Not so much for the price which comes with view. The food was horrible to say the least, everything was dry and blend. Not to mention, i found a piece of hard plastic with pointed edges in one of my kid's meal. I notified the waiter and all i got was \" ok, i will notify the people working inside\". Wow that was easy. I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"My birthday dinner, excellent service, yes it's expensive we paid $75 per person but good was amazing. I had Caesar salad to start, lamb with Risotto and asparagus perfectly cook lamb very tender juicy and full of flavour. Perfect for one time experience to celebrate, the view is unforgettable."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here. I came for lunch, they have fixed prices and a quite wide range of choices. And you can also go down 1 and 2 floors after your meal to enjoy CN Tower's balcony and glass floor - without paying the regular ticket, which is actually pretty expensive. Good deal!

The staff was kind and smiley, from the woman at the entrance at 1st level to the waiter who indicated us how to go downstairs. The view was amazing - even better than the one you have at the other floors! The movement is very slow (we completed only 1 rotation during our 2 courses meal), so you'll have time to enjoy every angle and feel relaxed. 

It's a pretty touristic restaurant, but still classy. So you can go there in your jeans and sneackers, if you are just a visitor in Toronto, but also in a nice dress if you want.

The courses' presentation was well-finished, and -what matters most!- the taste was good. The flavours were interesting but not pretentious, the ingredients fresh (even the bread was way better than some so-called \"housemade breads\" I've found in the US) and the quantities fair - we left satisfied. A perfect way to enjoy the view around us! We also tried a local beer - I don't remember the name, but it was good! 7CA$ per bottle, not bad after all.

I really felt relaxed and happy after this unique lunch, ready to step on the glass floor and almost elbow my way in the crowd downstairs."}
{"text":"We came to celebrate our anniversary during a trip to TO. We were seated near a window (as requested), but there isn't a bad seat in here.
Our server, mgmt, & other staff are helpful & polite. I would've given 5 stars for service instead of 4 if the entrees arrived sooner. That was probably the kitchen's fault. 
My husband had the Cesar salad & sea salt crusted salmon, we shared the shrimp cocktail, & I had the smoked arctic char. It wasn't that smokey, but still delicious. For dessert we had the dark chocolate tower & the white chocolate rhubarb brûlée tart--both to die for!
Yes it's a little pricey, but you're also paying for the view/experience. Access to the Glass Floor, LookOut, and SkyTerrace are included.
I would definitely revisit!"}
{"text":"I came here with my bf and his parents for my bf's and his mom's birthday. The wine selection was great and the pricing was good too. It was good value and easy drinking wine. However, what you're paying for is for the views and the fact that it's the CN Tower. The menu is prefixed rather because the a la cate menu is more expensive. So expect to spend $65 to $75 a person without wine, tip and tax. With tip and all would be about $120/person. The bad news is that we didn't get a view as it was misty that day and my seafood stew entree was just about average for $45(not including appetizer). However, they did give two birthday mousse cakes for the birthday people."}
{"text":"So, this is my second time here. My first experience in July 2015, it was almost magical. Wonderful staff, awesome food, and a very very nice view. Wonderful way to look at Toronto! This time, I can't believe I leave that little tip for almost any meal! The food remains the awesome quality, the view is still awesome, but I had the most racist server!!! He didn't even put our silverware on the table before the main dish is served (and I noticed that he did that for all the white folks table right after their appetizer is served). On top of that, he wanted to rush me out of the place as soon as I finish dinner! (We haven't even sit long enough for a full 360 view). When he tried to signal me to leave, I said I'm checking out the view. He got the nerve to asked me 'what are you looking at?', in a sarcastic way. This is such a big tourist spot, and for it not to be magical as my last time, it is a total disappointment!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to hype up an already well known resto, but I have to admit.... my meal was bomb. I ordered the Prime Rib ($10 extra if you are doing the prix fixe menu) and it was definitely more than I expected - taste & quantity. The service was \"meh\", you get better customer service at a Franchise Restaurant but whatever I'm there for the food and the view. Overall the price of dinner/drinks and the experience was well worth it. Would go again - salivating just thinking of that horseradish and prime rib while I look through my photos."}
{"text":"Really great service, wine selection, and views of course.  The food just isn't so great.  We split two of their vegetarian entrees, mushroom linguine and a curry eggplant dish.  Neither were memorable.  Had a bottle of a Canadian Cab, Niagara region, no complaints there.  No regrets coming, we essentially came for the view and the experience, not the food."}
{"text":"Wow...this place has really gone down hill in recent years.  I was at this restaurant about 10 years ago and loved it.  We went in early April for our honeymoon.....HORRIBLE.  We had a dinner reservation for 7pm on a Tuesday night.  We arrived and were dressed well as it is an expensive restaurant.  We paid about $250 for our meal (2 people).  We were definitely overdressed.  We should have come in jeans and torn t-shirts and ordered burgers and fries instead.  There were a bunch of loud kids and the kids at the table next to us kept rocking back against/hitting my husbands chair.  Once that party finally left we thought the night would get better.  Ambiance = 0.  The view is the only good thing...and the view is better from the observation deck honestly.
The waiter was inattentive and initial drinks took forever.  We never got refills on our drinks either.  They weren't overly busy so I don't really know why he went missing most of the night.  Once the food arrived, my husbands steak was decent...but we've had much better from our own grill at home.  The portions leave something to be desired.  He had mashed potatoes, but not much.  I had salmon that was overcooked and bland.  You would think for such an expensive meal you'd at least get some good Sockeye Salmon or better...nope...tasted like the frozen Atlantic Farm raised fish from the grocer store freezer aisle.  I also had a side of asparagus....a total of 5 medium sized asparagus.    
When I made the reservation I told them it was our honeymoon so they brought us a desert.  The desert was just OK too....it was a chocolate mouse type of thing and honestly it wasn't too sweet.  Expected better.

The best part of the meal was when we were passing the wine cellar and stopped to admire some of the bottles.  My husband made a comment to me about a bottle they had there on display and asked the waiter how much for a shot.  The manager came over and told us how much and even took us in there to see everything.  She told us they have only 1 of 3 bottles in Canada of this liquor...Louis XIII Black Pearl.  IT was something like $1500 per shot!  And only 3 patrons have ordered it before.  That was honestly the best part of the restaurant...the 10 minute conversation with this person about liquor that we didn't drink.  Other than that conversation, we would have given this place 1 star.  So sad."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful experience.
After the aquarium we were famished, deciding to have dinner at the CN Tower.
Great view, service and food, with two bottles of wine to pair with our delicious fare it was the perfect night. Definitely worth every penny. Service was exceptional, servers were attentive and knowledgeable. The view of the city at night was breathtaking and the food was what one would expect from such an establishment, delicious and flavourful.
Would certainly return again."}
{"text":"Had a very nice relaxing dinner here. Despite the fact that it was cloudy outside, we still were able to see downtown Toronto and the surrounding areas pretty well. The dining room revolves allowing for such great views. One rotation takes about 72 min. to complete. 

The food here is very good compared to previous revolving restaurants I've been to. The beet and squash tart tatin appetizer was very flavorful considering the fact I'm not a big beet eater. The pork tenderloin entree was very delicious and cooked perfectly. The apple stuffing and cabbage roll were great accompaniments. So were the brussell sprouts which were prob. some of the best I've ever eaten.

Keep in mind when you make the advance reservation you won't know what the weather will be on that given day. Some days it's nice, other days it isn't. We were lucky today."}
{"text":"Food is good, really satisfying. With such a price you'll get what you deserve, especially you'll get a generous portion of food that will make your stomach full. The uncomfortable part was the place is super crowded, and the seating arrangement is super close with each other (they want to fit in as many as possible) it's just so hard to move around, and it's hard to get a privacy."}
{"text":"This restaurant is good news and bad news.

Good News: Bathrooms were immaculate, awesome view, great bread, sour cream, baked potato, and chowder, and the mere coolness of a revolving restaurant.

Bad News: Prepare to be disapointed. As soon as you get food, things start to go downhill. My prime rib was so-so and looked worse than it tasted. Nobody wants to eat something that looks like an undercooked red lump! Vegetables were slighty tastless and the mussels were tiny and the gnocchi overcooked. I want to visit the CN tower again, but never 360!"}
{"text":"Came here with a big group last week and they were very accommodating (even had to move tables, etc. but they were very willing). It's a royal pain to get up to the restaurant and to an out-of-towner, it's not clear on where you need to go. We just wanted to go to dinner, we didn't need the full tourist experience, so it was a little annoying we couldn't move through some of that quicker (impatient New Yorker talking here). 

We ordered all of the appetizers from the prixe fixe menu and they were so-so. The table mostly ordered steaks and the bison tenderloin. I had the bison and it was amazing-- absolutely the best thing of the meal in my opinion. Wine was great as well. Dessert was average. 

While they were very nice, service was sloppy. Overall, if you're looking for a tourist experience, this is a good bet, but if you're looking for a great meal and a great dinig experience, I would suggest elsewhere."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for my fiancée and I two weeks prior to eating here.  Going into the dinner, I knew it was going to be higher priced than a traditional sit down restaurant. And it should be. The views are spectacular, the wait staff is extremely attentive but not over bearing, and the food is pretty good. In addition to the wonderful atmosphere, each person receives a complimentary trip to the observation deck and the glass floor. Tickets to the top of the CN tower normally cost $30 a piece. Taking the free tickets into consideration, the price really isn't all that bad for what you are getting. 



We ended up ordering a sirloin, the seafood sample platter, two Caesar cocktails, and one Caesar salad to split for our appetizer. The final bill was around $130 and I tipped another $25 on top of that. Subtract the $60 that tickets would have cost and my fiancée and I got a wonderful meal with unmatched views for around $100. In my mind, it was totally worth it. Great date night."}
{"text":"I absolutely love view points! This is the place to see all of Toronto! We had dinner reservations for 6:15 and it was almost a perfect time for it. We were able to see the city during the day, and while the sun set. Bonus: the Blue Jay's were playing so we were able to see them play a little bit. 
The food itself was good. Had the rare tuna slices for an appetizer, and a nice NY strip for dinner with a mashed potatoes. The steak was actually really good, and the merlot I had with it sang melodies of flavors in my mouth. My favorite course was dessert. I got the cheese plate sampler and a glass of Beaujolais and it was absolutely perfect for the sunset. Between mixing the fruit with the cheese, the honey with the cheese, and sipping on the beautiful Beaujolais I felt at complete ease. 
All and all if want to go to the top of the CN tower for free, come and have a good dessert and wine and get a free ride up. It'll be about the same price as it would be to just take the tower ride up."}
{"text":"Spectacular view of Toronto and the lake. I got a prix fixe menu of sirloin steak and it was great. The waiter was very attentive but not overbearing. He noticed I didn't like the clam chowder very much and offered to switch to a different item. Glad I did! I found that siting backward could help you from feeling motion sickness with this type of restaurant. Avoid direct sunlight to your face as well. 
Also, free access to the observatory deck and glass floor. 
I wasn't very fond of their nonalcohol cocktail but they have great range of wines"}
{"text":"I was there last year, but I still remember that evening in 360\". I think nothing can be better that a delicious dinner with a wonderful view of the city. The food was delicious. I ordered a fish( I believe it was salmon) and my bf had a steak, and we both liked our meals. Chocolate cake was very rich and creamy. 
It was one great night!"}
{"text":"You are literally paying for the view. The food is garbage, I am convinced that the food is microwaved."}
{"text":"Dinning at 360 will make a trip to the CN Tower more romantic and memorable than could be imagined. My husband and I chose to experience the CN tower by dinning in the restaurant located two floors above the observation deck in the evening. The food was mediocre at best as was the service. The experience and atmosphere is what was worth the price of the meal. Although I do not have intentions to return to 360, it is something to experience while in Toronto."}
{"text":"We had the prefix menu choosing an appetizer and main dish.  Both were fantastic and so was the service.  The waiter has worked there for 22 years!  Of coarse the view is spectacular on the 115th floor!"}
{"text":"The reviews are true, you pay for the view! Came here for as our last dinner shindig before leaving OOOH CANADAAA. 

The food is really just mediocre.. or even meh. I opted for the $80 prix fixed menu  to get a little bit of everything. I forgot what I ordered for the appetizer, but it must've been whatever if I can't even remember something from 2 months ago. For the entree I ordered the seafood gnocchi which was also very whatever. The gnocchi was too hard and flavorless. Seafood was overcooked and the sauce just didn't bring everything together. Again, I don't remember what I had for dessert which is really sad....

Moving on to the most annoying part of this whole experience... the freakin' WAIT. It doesn't matter if you have reservations, it's going to take you YEARS to get to the top. Waiting in line after line and going through security with air machines and everything. I'm pretty sure I aged a few years throughout this process.

I would skip dining here or just grab drinks for the view."}
{"text":"Wow.... what a disappointment.

I knew that I was getting sucked into a tourist trap but I thought I would at least have a good time doing so. Instead I was left with my wallet emptied and taste buds unfulfilled.

The decor is not much to talk about. Everything is cappuccino colored wood, from the chairs to the walls, the only things that weren't that color was the white ceiling and cutlery on the table. There's really no need to have a nice decor when you have the best view of the city and surrounding suburbs. 

Service was great as the place wasn't busy and the waitstaff was happy and always around when you needed them to check on you. Problem is that this service dropped extremely quickly once the Jonas brothers and their Disney friends showed up. As nice as the Jonas brothers and friends were and as big of a star you have in your restaurant, normal clientele shouldn't suffer at the expense of having someone famous around.

I really liked the food I got, problem is that I shared the $80 seafood tower and it would be pretty hard to mess it up as everything is basic boiled, steamed, served raw, and finished off with lemon. The tower was huge and there definitely were a lot of leftovers, definitely worth the price even if I wasn't in a tourist spot I would pay that much for it.

The others that were with me didn't have such a great food experience. Not that it was bad, it was just pretty standard and lifeless is all. Nothing exciting, flavors were mediocre, and presentation wasn't what you would expect for a tourist trap. The cooks must have been hoping that the excitement would all come from the view and not the food. Definitely not worth the $69 prix-fixe 3-course meal. I know it does sound like a bargain, but with quality that low, it isn't. Steak was chewy, duck was tough, dessert was uninteresting and there was a foul odor coming from some sort of sausage.  

If you wanna do the whole tourist thing I recommend doing it through the restaurant as you won't have to wait in the tourist line for an hour and access to the CN tower is free with your meal. 

Overall, I'm glad I got to do this as I haven't been to the CN tower since I was 8. Probably one of the better places for standard seafood in the city. That being said I wouldn't go back without a reason since everything else was such a flop."}
{"text":"Before heading to Toronto we decided we would want to eat at the CN Tower to enjoy the beautiful 360 view of Toronto. Even though we arrived about 30 min earlier than our reservation, we were seated straight away directly at the window, with a beautiful view. We opted for a 2 course meal and I also asked for a wine recommendation, which ended up costing me $23 per glass. 

For the 2 course meal, which is $65 per person without drink, I opted for entree and dessert and chose the prime rib beef steak (for an additional $10) and the pistachio cranberry cheesecake. First up I ordered my steak medium-rare and it came more than well done. The presentation was just ugly and something I would expect at sports bar/pub. And on top of that the steak was completely unseasoned, no salt, no pepper. Very disappointing. The cheesecake was good though. Even though I get that people just come up to this restaurant for the view, I just can't get over the fact how overpriced it is. If I would come to Toronto again I would probably just pay for the view but not for a meal anymore, there are too many other places close by with excellent food!"}
{"text":"I'm a reluctant tourist trapee, however I feel my disinclined visit to 360 warrants a positive shout out. You don't just want to say you did the CN Tower.  You're after experiences. The best view of the city and Lake Ontario, good service, and a prix fixe that's predictable at $55.  When you'd pay 3/4 that amount for 1/3 of what I described it's the only way to do the CN Tower without feeling hoodwinked.

Tip1: Early reservation gets you a window seat and a less than full house. In my opinion, on a spring or fall day with the right company, and the sunset, it's a deal."}
{"text":"Really liked the option of staying at the CN tower after the Edge walk. The food and drinks were delicious! I had chicken and my daughter had salmon. Both were good!"}
{"text":"Just remember... You are paying for the experience and view.... Not the food.

The wait staff did do a great job."}
{"text":"Note:  This review is specifically for Horizons Restaurant, the satellite to 360, on a lower floor of CN Tower Pod.  My rating (4 stars) is for overall 360 restaurant, including Horizons.  Confusing, I know.

Honestly had no intention of eating at Horizons however, poor planning on our part :-( meant we needed to eat, and Gramma, who was with us, couldn't handle any more walking. So, up we went, eating in Horizons Restaurant, the satellite to 360.

When you factor in the cost of the elevator, and the price of the food - it is not cheap - but from a convenience factor, the Horizons restaurant is handy.   The food is reliably decent.   Had we planned to eat at the CN Tower, we would have reserved at 360 and done lunch or dinner up there, as reservation includes elevator.  (Still expensive... but you sort of feel like you won on that deal, don't you?)

I had the Short Ribs - thought they were great, though towards the end, I was noticing they were just a tad too salty.  However - ribs were piled on top of nice selection of root veggies (perfectly cooked), with herbed polenta, and a yummy sauce/gravy.  I thought it was great.

Hubby had hamburger - said it was good, but too expensive - there are better burgers to be found for less cost.

Son had trout/shrimp - he loved it.  Daughter stuck to french fries - can't go too too wrong there.  Gramma had a selection of spreads on a toasted bread, and said she enjoyed that too.

A few thoughts, as a former Torontonian (and still one at heart): If you think you want to eat there, make a reservation at 360.  The price of dinner at 360 includes the elevator ride, and the food is reliably good (though admittedly over-priced).  The view is phenominal, and you get a great rotating view of the city - Horizons does not rotate.  Check the weather before you go - only go if the weather is good.  If timing works for you - plan your reservation for maybe an hour before dark - get there early, do the observation deck while it still light out, then head up for dinner and watch Toronto light up.  It's beautiful.

Would I recommend:  Everyone should eat at the top of Toronto once - however, go the reservation route with 360 instead of the satellite Horizons.
Would I return:  I will return to 360, but not to Horizons.  They may share menu items, but it's a different dining experience."}
{"text":"This is by far the restaurant with the best view I have ever been in. It's on the top of the CN tower in Toronto. 
We came in during the day to see the city from above and discovered there is a restaurant that actually rotates so you get a 360 view of downtown. It is awesome. We made reservations that morning for seven in the evening. That is the beauty of vacationing off season. No lines, no crowds, easy reservations! 
The admission fee to the top of the tower is about $30, but when you make reservations for the restaurant is included. 
We came in promptly at 7:00pm and where taken to a private elevator right to the restaurant. It feels cozy, the lighting is low for maximum romance and view appreciation. It took me a little while to realize that we were moving. Ir hadn't dawned on me why it's called 360. 

Food is served pre-fixe style. Two choices $65 entree and dessert, $79 appetizer, entree, and dessert. They have an extensive wine selection (not included) 

Dishes are your typical tiny, well arranged and garnished 5 star restaurant. I had beet salad and the pork entree. It wasn't as good as you'd expect, but everything else was amazing. Service was top notch, wine was amazing. I even bought a bottle to have at the hotel. A great experience."}
{"text":"$65 for a prix fixe meal for dinner. The restaurant is a revolving one on top of the CN tower so you can imagine how amazing the view might be.
However on a cloudy / rainy day this may be quite an expensive affair for a view of the clouds that surround the tower. 
The food is not bad, I had the chicken and it was just ok. Portions were surprisingly large. Dessert was terrible - I don't remember the name but it was a bland chocolate dish - very very forgettable.
To eat here once is enough because you're really paying for the view and not the food. 
Good place to celebrate a birthday if you're a local. For a visitor, this is one of the things you need to check off your \"Things to do in Toronto\" list."}
{"text":"I think if you want to visit the tower the best option is to go during lunch time as if you their package you can also have access to the tower. The food is good/ok but the 360 view and atmosphere are Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the view and how quiet the restaurant was. There's nothing like eating lunch with you family while getting a literal 360 view of the city of Toronto. Though personally, I prefer the lake view. 

The food was okay. Nothing too special, but the garlic mash potatoes are absolutely delicious!

I would recommend that people should go once... but I don't think I'd return again."}
{"text":"I took my mother to this restaurant for a special occasion at 4pm on Jan.8th.   Both of us ordered Grilled Canadian Pine Meadow Farm's Tenderloin \"6 oz\" and Half an Atlantic lobster which cost $95.-    My mother asked medium stake, and I ordered \"medium rare\" stake.  Our stakes were so thick, and they looked just great. My mother's stake was excellent, and she really enjoyed it.    My stake was almost raw.  It was not even rare.  Our waiter took it back and brought it again.  The second stake was  1/4 thin of the first raw stake.  A little bit wider than my mother's stake.  Absolutely, it was not \"6 oz\".   I assume the chef was not confident in grilling a thick steak as medium rare.  That is why they served a very thin stake, instead.  They have a nerve to serve the different size and shape stakes  for the same two orders.   The lobster was not baked, even on the source on top of the half lobster.  It was actually cold.   I complained about the first and the second stake politely.  However, I did not complain about Lobster because I did not want to ruin our special dinner.   I just thought my mom was happy with her meal, anyway......      They charge lots, and we expect quality food.   They must serve the same quality food for the same order.   They must be serious about their food quality."}
{"text":"If you want to treat yourself, this is the place to do it.  I thought this was going to be a typical tourist trap, but I was actually really pleased with my experience here.

My boyfriend took me here for my birthday one year.  The view...I think is pretty self-explanatory.  It's beautiful.  And of course, the fact that it spins around (slowly) is every better.  I went for lunch, but I would love to come again for dinner as the sun is setting. 

We both got the fixed price menu and had an appetizer, main and dessert.  I was surprised at how big the portions were.  I find sometimes more expensive places - especially when you get the fixed menu - tend to have smaller portions.  These were definitely not small portions.  By the time I got to the dessert - which was absolutely delicious - I was so stuffed I couldn't finish it.  A lot of flavour in the dishes, and cooked excellently.  

The service was fantastic.  Friendly, attentive and let's you enjoy the experience.  Everything you would want."}
{"text":"5 stars for the view!!! We had a window seat and it's an experience that you'll never forget!!! I give 5 stars for the customer service as well!!! They were ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I give the food 3 stars tho it's nothing spectacular... its average and you have to spend a lot of money for it... I've had better food elsewhere for cheaper ... but nothing can compare to that view!!!"}
{"text":"The view and ambiance were great.  The food and service were poor.  The price of the food is way too high for the food quality.  Our waiter wanted to bump us to another table to accommodate other people even though our table was reserved days in advance."}
{"text":"We were told that you by pass the line to see the observation deck if you make a reservation at 360 which we did, we know it's going to cost us money but it's ok so we did the lunch (fix menu) $59 if you pick 2 and $72 if you pick 3 from the menu . oh boy Food sucks no joke, I ordered the salmon, my husband he picked the chicken,  it tasted dry and old, the soup tasted like from the can of progreso  it what a waist of money the only thing that made me forget how bad it taste was the view it was amazing! It rotates you can see the view of Toronto."}
{"text":"I came here with my family. It was definitely an experience to remember. We had the 2 course meal. We thought the food was very good. 
My brother and Mom had the East and West Coast Seafood Aguachile while my dad and I had the Caesar Salad. My mom and brother did not like their salad. The shrimp and fish was partially cooked. I think it was supposed to be like that. I tried a shrimp and it tasted slimy, and bitter, which we all personally did not enjoy. I think it was supposed to be like that. My brother described it as \"it tasted like they took it out of the ocean, pealed it and put it on the plate.\" 
Everyone enjoyed the bacon that was in the Caesar Salad. 
As an entree, my brother had the Lobster Pasta, my Dad and I had the Ontario Chicken Ballotine, my mom had the Atlantic Salmon Fillet. My dad and I enjoyed our meal. Everything was cooked very well. My brother finished his dish in no time! 
Aside from the food, the 360 view was wonderful. The restaurant spins around. We noticed by the time we sat down, until we finished our food, we had made a 360 degree rotate. It was as if they timed it so perfectly. I noticed the glasses we had was a bit dirty and had a bad smell in them which was a turn off! 
We didn't feel the money was worth it tho. Once in a lifetime experience"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place!  The view was breathtaking, the rotating floor great for taking in the entire city-view, and the booth was very comfy.  We were delighted the observation deck tour was included with the reservation.  Selection of menu items were great, the food was tasty with great presentation.  Loved the sweet potato fries! A 'must' experience, and highly recommend the pre-fixed menu for cost savings. Only negative feedback was that when the reservation was made,  we asked for a table by the window, which we did not get.  Apparently, the window tables are only for two, whereas we were a party of three.  In addition, we noted in the reservation that it was a birthday celebration, which wasn't acknowledged by anyone. Not cool!"}
{"text":"I was in Toronto on business.  I had about 4 hours to kill before my flight so I decided to do the most touristy thing and have dinner at the 360 restaurant. I am from Chicago and I have my own opinion about having dinner at the Sears Tower or Hancock building so was quite surprised with my experience.  I went there around 430 was seated by the window and had a very good meal.  I ordered the prix fixe menu and got the gnocchi appetizer, arctic char, and butter tart.  The arctic char was very very good.  It was fresh and the accompaniments were nice.  I left fulfilled. For the 3 course meal and 2 dirty martinis it was less than $100 USD.  This may seem pricy, however for the experience itself to get the 360 view of the Toronto it was well worth it (and it includes the deck which I think was $35 alone - but is included with dinner).  So maybe yes if you live in Toronto you may find a better way to spend $100 but for a common tourist like me it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"I made reservations here for a Romantic dinner and was quite pleased! The view was obviously amazing, the food portions were huge! It took my date and I to eat the salad and dessert thay came with my meal. The food tasted amazing I had the vegetarian pasta. The service was good as well. It was pretty pricy but seeing as your paying for the view and the food and the service. We were very satisfied."}
{"text":"Yes, as many have stated, the food isn't anything to rave about, but it's decent. Our waiter had no personality and seemed bothered to be there, but wasn't exactly rude and still helped us with anything we needed.
Those items aside, I still give this place 4 starts because:
- You skip the HUGE line to go up the tower. At least we did, with an early dinner reservation.
- You are paying to go up anyway, might as well get some food for it.
- You still get to enjoy the other level (Outdoor observation deck and glass floor room)
- Killer view
- Restaurant went around 2 times during our dinner, dessert, and a coffee so we got to see a lot."}
{"text":"Disappointing an mediocre in all respects except the view.  As a party of two we ordered a variety of dishes, expecting to be delighted.  None of the food was exceptional.  Prawns were overcooked, cocktail shrimp were old and beginning to turn flavor as was the cold crab and halibut.  Asparagus was hard enough to require a knife to slice and bland.  I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone, it was a waste of money."}
{"text":"So we knew coming into this it was a tourist trap, but we were happy to go along with it. After all what better way to see Toronto from the top of the CN Tower whilst eating a meal in a revolving restaurant.

So to get in the CN Tower costs $32 but if you chose the restaurant option for $55 you get to jump the queue and get a 3 course meal on top.

We actually went for the $75 five course option, and admittedly by the time we had bought wine it came to about $170 each. It was expensive but we wanted to do something nice as a group on our first day away.

The food was good overall. The waiter did make a mistake on our bill which was amended.

Overall expensive but worth it. One of the best things to do in Toronto."}
{"text":"There is so much to review here. So everyone is encouraged to make reservations in which I did. Although reservations were for 4:30pm, there is a process in which do not expect to even get seated until 5:15pm due to lines, photography and elevator standbys. Sitting by the window is first come first serve, there is an hour wait if you would like to sit by the window which you have to make once you finally get seated and see that you are not by the window. I recommend everyone to do this wait, why? because you are paying for this view so you should definitely get what you paid for! If you hate waiting no worries there is an observatory room where you can let the hour go by really quick! The view is magnificent! The food requires that you spend atleast $65 per person via entree. Now I ended up getting a seafood platter which I was not really happy about, the food here is seldom and not the best in the world, you are mainly paying for the setting and view."}
{"text":"Always great whenever I eat here. Every person considering going to the CN tower should go here instead. The prix fixed menu ends up around $60 but it includes free admission which is worth $20. You also have a separate line so you don't line up with the general public"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. I tried New Farms Green Salad, Atlantic Salmon Fillet, & Dark Chocolate Lava Cake. All excellent. 4 stars because it took a while for the main course to come out and I had to ask for drink refills."}
{"text":"This is an experience to be had, but not necessarily repeated. We went for our anniversary lunch at this restaurant. It's apparently all about the views, and not about the service at all. 

When I've gone to almost any restaurant in this price range in the past, the server was very hospitable and was able to make strong recommendations about the menu based upon what kind of good we liked. This time, our waiter barely talked to us, and it felt like we were swimming in choices. No one seemed to care that we were there for s special occasion. It seemed like they were just trying to get everyone in and out quickly. Even when I asked for recommendations, he was not helpful. This made it harder to make a decision.

I ended up being happy with my food, but my husband paid extra for the prime rib, and found it rather bland and overcooked. I had the shrimp cocktail and a chicken entree. The dessert was also very good. We were there on our anniversary, and other people have posted things about them doing something nice for them because they were celebrating, but they didn't even ask us. 

It's s cool concept as a restaurant, and it was nice to revolve and see the whole city. If you factor the price of going up the tower into the cost, it seems less expensive and possibly worth it. If you compare the cost of other high-end dining restaurants (and the service), it's definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Went there for a special occasion and it was the first time for everyone in a party of 8. We went for the prix fixe lunch menu and if I were reviewing just the food, it would get 2 / 3 stars for overpriced, unspectacular fare. But it gets 4 because the atmosphere and the novelty of being in a revolving restaurant, a thousand feet about Toronto really did make for an extremely enjoyable afternoon."}
{"text":"Born and raised in Ontario and this was my 1st time at CN Tower. View is amazing, and the  food was even better. I had the seafood platter to start, which was good. No complaints. Ricotta Parmesan Gnocchi was next dish and I loved it. Right up my alley. Main was Wellington County Rabbit which was amazing. Mash, Kale and juicy Rabbit with a sick gravy. Comfort food on steroids. Place cost some $$$ - but worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"It's touristy and some of the people there are annoying.  But it's got a view no other restaurant can match.  And the food isn't terrible.  The service was generic though."}
{"text":"Comme nous avions prévu de monter à la CN Tower nous avons remarqué que payer le restaurant incluait l'entrée à la tour. Car oui au final la tour est au dessus du point de vue ! Je précise aussi qu'après le repas vous pouvez faire tous les trucs classiques : aller au belvédère, à la nacelle (avec supplément) et le plancher de verre.

Nous sonnes venus un midi avec les 2 types de menus (55 et 65$) et nous avons réellement apprécié notre expérience et ce par rapport à plusieurs points que je vais expliquer plus en détail.

- La vue :
Clairement la vue est MAGISTRALE, nous avons une vue sur 360 degrés sur tout Toronto et sa proche banlieue incluant le lac et le petit aérodrome. Il faut savoir que le restaurant tourne sur la tour cela veut dire que n'importe où vous serez placés vous pourrez tous voir car pour faire un tour complet il faut 1h ce qui est largement dépassé durant le repas. 
Vous serez donc en train de manger tranquillement et vous pourrez en parallèle profitez de la vue à 360 sans bouger de votre siège. C'est je pense une expérience unique dans le genre. Vous ne serez donc pas dérangé par des personnes voulant prendre des photos, des gamins hurlant à coté de vous, vous serez bien confortable ... Cela est un point non négligeable et un gros point pour l'expérience culinaire.

- Les plats :
Nous avons apprécié chacun de nos plats. La qualité était au rdv que ca soit pour le plat principal ou les desserts.
Pour ma part j'avais pris un morceau de cote de boeuf avec purée de patate, panné et champignons. La viande était braisé parfaitement à la bière guiness avec une super sauce qui l'accompagnait. La part de viande était assez costaud. Le plat était délicieux ! La cote de porc avec os fumé à froid était très bonne aussi, bien épaisse pour vous caler et la canneberge relevé remarquablement le tout. Le jarret d'agneau braisé à la moutarde était tout aussi bon. 
Les viandes sont de super qualité et le mariage des saveurs est bien présent :)
Au niveau des desserts cela a permis de finir le repas comme il a commencé: parfaitement ! Mon cheesecake était excellent, la sauce avec le fruit de la passion et les zestes d'orange lui conférait une petite acidité parfaite qui contrebalançait avec le sucré classique d'un gâteau au fromage. La tartelette à la pacane et la canneberge était toute aussi bonne. Rien à redire.

- Le service :
Rien à redire, à l'écoute de nos demandes. Peut être parfois trop rapide pour retirer les assiettes mais pas non plus pressant.
On nous a proposé les cartes en français (celle que j'ai pris en photo) donc c'était gentil.

- Le rapport qualité/prix :
Je pense que c'es vraiment correct car entre le repas que nous avons réellement apprécié et la super vue nous avons vraiment chacun vécu une expérience unique. Au final pour un plat et un dessert (sans vin ni café) je m'en suis sortis pour 70% taxe et tips inclus.
Compte tenu du cadre exceptionnel et de la qualité des plats je ne regrette pas une seul seconde sachant que monter à la CN Tower coûte dans les 36$ sur internet (et plus sur place) ce n'est vraiment pas déconnant car on est dans de meilleurs condition que juste monter de manière classique et en plus vous mangez bien :)
Je précise que je suis venu le midi et que le soir cela doit être un peu plus cher ;-)

Bref je suis ravis et je vous le conseille fortement si vous aviez des doutes de le faire ou pas ! De mon coté je souhaiterais y retourner le soir pour avoir une autre vue lors de ma prochaine venue :)"}
{"text":"Pro tip for everyone looking to go up to the CN Tower -- your entrance is free with the meal. Entrance is $38 and a meal is $62 (+tax and tip of course). So effectively, you're paying ~$30 more for a really good meal, and V I E W S (these views are much better than what you see if you were to just go up to the observation deck). You also get to skip the super long line to go up, as there's a separate elevator for the restaurant. 

So, onto the food. I'd recommend the bison tartare for the appetizer, especially if you like tartare. It's very good, although quite small in portion. The lobster bisque, while presentation was good, was way too salty and I couldn't even drink more than a few sips. It has no flavor whatsoever, and they made the lobster into some sort of fried ball so you don't even really have any lobster. 

For entree, I'd recommend the Ontario chicken and the duck breast. The sablefish was too salty, again, but very tender. 

The chocolate tower is quite a good dessert. 

In all, the food here is quite good. Some dishes were on the salty side, but just read some reviews to know which to watch out for before you make your pick and you should be good. So glad I went here instead of just paying to go up to the observation deck."}
{"text":"Horrible food and overly priced! You can tell they did not work really hard in preparing the food. The only good thing about our night was being at the CN tower and enjoying the view. Other than that i felt a little dizzy in the beginning and we still left $300.00 for 2 people. I don't mind spending money if its worth it. The hype is too big for this. Its definitely a scam to steal the tourists money. Do not go here!"}
{"text":"Went here already knowing that I wasn't supposed to expect great service, neither great food. All reviews from TripAdvisor, Yelp and Foursquare were right on the spot. The food here is mediocre, expensive and the service is terrible. However, the experience is priceless and it is something you should do at least once in a lifetime. 

You don't pay to go up to the tower if you dine in here, so, think that you are saving the cost of the lift ticket. I had the Alberta AAA Striploin beef. I think it is really from Alberta, because the time it took to come to me, looks like they were flying them from Alberta.... also, they were rushing so much my food (it just took a bit less than 70 minutes to get delivered -- I know because it takes 75 minutes to rotate and I was almost to the starting point when I got served)  that the steak came in completely raw and still cold in the middle. 

The chocolate tower is the most popular dessert, but it is really a bite size cake, without much taste.

Again.... if you are thinking about coming here to have a fantastic meal, think again. You'll get a fantastic view with a terrible service and not so good food."}
{"text":"We have mixed ratings. We were there to celebrate our anniversary. Upon being seated, BJ, our waiter asked about our order shortly. We were amazed and enjoyed our table by the window. He said we'll see one revolution by the end of dinner. We felt a little rushed during the meal. That was fine. The food was fine. My wife stepped away to freshen up after the main course. Upon returning, BJ said \"you have ten minutes left and you better order dessert now\". We went only two thirds of the revolution. We voiced her opinion of being rush. BJ said we actually had forty five minutes, based on where we were sitting and our table is programmed for another party shortly. My wife complained to someone who seems to be a manager. AJ listened and offered to set up a table to finish our dinner with dessert. We knew the place was programmed for a certain amount of time and turned his offer down. He offered dessert at a separate area. We accepted as it didn't seem to interfere with the restaurant operation. Afterwards, we can see that BJ was doing his job, moving progress along, probably worthy of 3 stars as we felt rushed, but AJ made our evening and our anniversary memorable. We appreciate the extra attention AJ provided and allowed us to stay to enjoy the view as long as we liked. His part deserved a five stars plus."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here during a visit to Toronto, and it was delightful. Pricey, yes, but worth it for the experience - plus the food and cocktails were on point. Our waiter was a delightful guy who we chatted with for a while. You get free admission to the tower with your reservation, so you get a tour and all of that stuff, so I would say it's an experience worth having."}
{"text":"Went to 360 with on vacation with my grandparents in 2006. I found some picture albums and am going back and writing after reminiscing the good times. The service was great and attentive. The atmosphere was lively and positive. Smells of class. A must see when in Toronto. The food was delicious and well presented! A knockout of flavors Make sure to see the glass floor, its so fun!

An unforgettable and amazing experience!"}
{"text":"This is actually a 4.5 star review

Quite simply one of the most unique dining experiences one can have!! Think about it...There is nothing \"standard\" about eating a fine meal inside a lavishly appointed round glass hall, that rotates ever so slightly, at over 1000 feet!!

Besides the spell bounding experience, the food and service were very good! The waiter was attentive to our requirements and any special requests. One small issue I had was with the lack of seasoning on my veal, and on another dish.

All in all, a MUST for anyone who loves dining and unique experiences!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. The $56 2 course meal covered the cost to the top and it was $40 for the kids. The server was great, appetizer beets and goat cheese was amazing. The main course of the salmon was underwhelming. Bypassing the long line is worth it 100%."}
{"text":"For more than 3 decades, I have never ever been to the CN tower (despite being born in Toronto) LOL.  Anyway, we had a nice meal for my birthday and what a breathtaking view.  Luckily it was a clear day and I enjoyed eating my dinner while the place rotates.  After you are finished your meal, we highly recommend you go take the stairs and visit the lower level (observation deck) and you can see more of the city (as well as stand outside).  You also get to access the area where they have the glass floor (not sure what that's called) so you might as well get your money's worth and enjoy this aspect."}
{"text":"The view and dining experience you get is 5 stars!  The food is 4 stars,  and service is 5 stars. If I paid the prefix price for lunch and dinner,  I would say the food isn't worth the price, but if you bake in the price of accessing the skyfloor and bypassing the line  to take the elevator up and down the CN tower,  is well worth it  IMHO! After you dine,  ask you have to do is walk down one level from the restaurant to go to glassfloor and sky terrace.  The actual best view is at the sky pod which higher up from the restaurant and is extra.  The second best view is from the 360 restaurant. The general public get to view toronto through a net at the sky terrace.  At the restaurant you look through a clean glass. The restaurant rotates so you don't have to walk around the the cn tower to get the other views and you are not competing with the crowd! 

The 360 Restaurant is  1151 ft above the ground and the restaurant is rotating while you are dining . The food is decent but not $60 pp good, especially if bringing kids who want buttered pasta.  Service is impeccable. They have an extensive wine list,  but unfortunately didn't get to try any.  I highly recommend eating here if you are going up the tower!"}
{"text":"We grabbed dinner after a Jays game, and enjoyed the atmosphere and the food. I love oysters, so started off with a dozen. Not the best I've had, but good none the less. After the oysters I had a tomato salad and the prime rib.

Honestly, the food was pretty standard for a 'nice' restaurant. The Keg would be comparable at a fraction of the price. What you pay for here is the atmosphere, and also some great service. 

We got an extra thrill when Josh Donaldson and a few other Blue Jays sat down a few tables over after creaming the Detroit Tigers. We'd been at the game too, so was a great way to cap off a weekend of Blue Jays baseball."}
{"text":"I already knew that this place is very pricy but food potion, actual taste of food was less than two stars. I m giving 2 stars for services. Service and view was outstanding, 
It just good to go once in your life time. 

I ordered Caesar salad for appetizer ,  the bacon was unbelievably salty . 

Pasta and steak was ok."}
{"text":"Sure its pricey, but did you look around?

The view and the drinks are spectacular. The food was decent.

I shared the small sea food platter with a friend. It wasn't anything special.

I had the stuffed porn medallion, this was surprisingly tasty. My friend had the steak and it was a basic steak.

The dessert was baked cobbler with some ice cream- the best thing we ate!

Since your admission to the CN tower is included in the meal price, I think it is worth atleast 1 visit.

Rating: I am torn between 2 and 3"}
{"text":"I came here with the boyfriend for our anniversary. Unfortunately I ended up with motion sickness half way through our dinner. The restaurant rotates, really slowly, not many do feel the motion but I did.

The food was good, couldn't really enjoy it, but the flavour was there. I just had trouble keeping it down due to feeling sick. We ended up taking our main and desert to go.

The staff were fantastic, nice, helpful and sympathetic.

I won't be coming back here due to my sensitivity to the motion, but for  but those who look for sight seeing city views during their dinner, this would be the place to go."}
{"text":"Wow was this place absolutely amazing!! Food was spectacular and view was fantastic. I would recommend everyone to at least try this once. Great service too! Our waiter Michael was funny and made it even more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"We totally thought this place would be a tourist trap for those who wanted to visit for the views, but we were wrong. The food was actually pretty good and above average. 

First off, getting a reservation wasn't too hard. We showed up a the front of CN tower and lined up to go through to obnoxious security (which I can prove to be useless). Took about 5 minutes to pass through the line and another couple minutes for the security to check your stuff. Walked into the lobby and straight up to the reception. I asked if it was possible to get a reservation for a table for 5. She said there were tables available and we could get booked for first seating at 11am. 

Going up to the restaurant took longer than passing through security and the reservation process. I believe they only have 2 lifts for the restaurant and they work simultaneously, but still we had to wait for about 15 minutes. 

Scored a window seating. Server was nice and had a sense of humor. 
Worth mentioning: 
- Dry Aged Ribeye, claimed to be 40+ day aged. I personally eat a lot of dry aged beef because we have a local butcher which does aging. The aged beef served at the restaurant didn't have the aged beef taste that I was hoping for. But, it was super juicy and tender. Grilled close to perfection. 
- Mussels (appetizer), these were good. They mussels used were pretty meaty and the soup base had plenty of taste to them. 

Failed: 
- Cod, horribly done.. super dry
- Pan Seared Atlantic Salmon, skip as well. Dry 
The chefs don't seem to know how to do fish well. 

Price = pretty decent for $59CAD which = to be about $45USD. The ribeye was much more, but we don't need to talk about that right now. It cost about $33CAD = $25USD for general admission of the tower, which you only get to walk around and take a few pictures. For a few bucks more, you can enjoy your lunch or dinner and sit in for over and hr to get the spectacular view and eat something. Take this for example, if you just go up to the tower and come back down, you still need to spend money on food. Considering a hotdog and soft drink will probably cost you 10CAD. You do the math. 

I say it's a solid 3.5 stars rounded up"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, if you're afraid of heights this may not be the best place for u to enjoy a dinner  in my opinion the view was breathtaking with a hint of scary. The food tasted fresh and surprisingly enough for an expensive restaurant it wasn't just one piece of overpriced lettuce. Service was amazing, I always hear that Canadians are so much nicer than Americans and I'm starting to believe that it's not just a rumor. You get to choose from either a two or three course meal option. I chose the two and got a dinner the salmon which was sort of a lemony flavor which was very delicious. For my second part I ordered a dessert, chocolate moose which was very light and not too strong after a good meal."}
{"text":"good food and a great view.
Nice decor, but a bit on the chilly side.

Service was a bit soft, but overall good value and experience."}
{"text":"Our experience here did not feel to be worth almost $100 each for dinner. Portions were quite small. The lobster bisque didn't seem to have lobster in it - being from Boston it wasn't what I expected. The view is nice if you get sit next to the windows, which we did not. Staff were great, friendly, and respectful. Observation deck left much to be desired."}
{"text":"It was one of the best restaurants we visited in Toronto. Their food is delicious and pricy but they are well worth the money, plus the view is amazing. You can see the whole city and It will take 72 minutes to come to your original spot."}
{"text":"Terrible. Only redeeming factor is the view from the tower.

Food is so mediocre and over priced. Flavors were very bland and textures weren't exciting. It's a fine dining type of establishment so I would expect much much more. It's a guilty little pleasure of mine to dine at all the revolving tower restaurants in the world and I would say this one is the worst I've been to... 

It's so unfortunate and disappointing..."}
{"text":"although the food at this restaurant is good, it's not worth the cost. this restaurant seems to be catered to tourists and charges a hefty premium for the view. 

it was fun to eat here, but i would not eat here again. for the cost, i'd rather go to a much better restaurant such as canoe."}
{"text":"The food is very pretty to the eyes but very bland. Needs more seasoning.

Service was great
The view was great
Overpriced ( Ice cream was 18.00) 

It was overall a nice experience but nothing to bring me back there."}
{"text":"J'ai un avis très mitigé sur ce lieu car j'ai adoré le concept, le lieu avec sa vue à couper le souffle mais aussi niveau de la cuisine je m'attendais à plus gastronomique. 

La montée de la CN Tower coûte relativement cher  (36$CND) et pour avouer le - pas grand chose à part une jolie vue. C'est donc cher payé. 
Du coup, en vacances avec ma mère à Toronto, nous avons décidé de fêter ses 50ans au restaurant 360°. Une manière unique et spéciale de fêter un tel événement. Les premiers menus étant à 65$ (55$ je crois quand j'y suis allée) avec la possibilité ensuite d'accès aux plateformes de la tour pour la vue. Nous nous sommes dis que cela sera une belle expérience, c'est quand même pas tous les jours qu'on dîne dans l'un des plus hauts restaurants tournant du monde. 

Bref, en mode on n'a qu'une vie et c'est pas tous les mois qu'on reviendra au canada - et que tu auras 50ans, maman; je réserve. Il y a même une petite case pour préciser si on vient pour un événement spéciale ou non. 

On arrive, on est très bien reçu même si l'anglais n'est pas trop ça. Notre serveur est un brin trop collant et lui ne veux faire aucun effort en français, alors je tente de me faire comprendre en anglais bourré de fautes. Mais bon, pas grave on est là pour un anniversaire. On arrive de jour, un peu avant le coucher du soleil pour bien profiter de la vue - c'est vraiment ça qui vaut le détour. 

On choisi le menu comme convenu pour minimiser les frais, car au Canada il ne faut jamais oublier qu'on devra payer les taxes et les tips (environ 30% en plus sur le prix). 
Les plats sont bons, mais pas plus que dans un bon bistronomique. En fait, je crois que je m'attendais peut-être à un peu plus niveau gastronomie vue le lieu de dingue. Et puis, les portions sont petites, l'entrée était clairement un amuse-douche. Du coup, je me dis que quand même c'est un peu cher payé niveau nourriture. Mais bon, on paie la vue en fait. C'est fou car en fait, c'était correct, mais je ne sais pas j'ai eu l'impression de rester sur ma faim. 

résultat des courses, une note à plus aux environs de 200 avec les menus, une bouteilles de vin à 40, les fameuses taxes et les tips qu'on nous impose à 15 ou 20%. Franchement, je n'ai pas aimé ça, car malgré le lieu, le serveur qui voulait nous enlever nous plats avant qu'on est fini et qui n'a pas voulu faire d'effort pour nous comprendre, ça méritait clairement pas le pourboire qu'on nous demandé. 

Puis, une petite déception car malgré l'événement des 50ans de ma mère, nous n'avions rien eu. Je n'attendais pas un gâteau avec bougies, juste un Joyeux anniversaire ou un Happy Birthday au moment où on nous a accueilli, mais rien. C'est un peu dommage car on nous avait demandé de le spécifier sur le site internet. C'est un détail mais bon...

Après nous avons eu accès aux étages de la CN Tower pour la vue de Toronto la nuit, et c'est vraiment beau. Le plateau de verre est petit mais c'est sympa quand même. 

Une belle soirée, de beaux souvenirs avec ma mère, même si la facture est un peu salée... 

Du coup l'idée du restaurant 360°C est une bonne option pour visiter la CN Tower si vous avez une bonne raison d'y aller - comme un anniversaire  ou une autre occasion à fêter. Si c'est pour essayer de faire une économie sur la montée de la tour, ce n'est pas le cas."}
{"text":"The food is adequate, the price is ridiculous, but the view is miraculous. 

Much higher than most rotating restaurants - it took us about 30 minutes to settle our stomachs. Absolutely breathtaking. Plus you get halfway up the CN Tower for free, which usually costs a fair amount.

I'm glad I went, and you will be too."}
{"text":"We were in Toronto for a getaway week with the boyfriend and we thought it would be nice to have a nice fancy-ish sort of dinner. We reserved the time where it was an hour or so before sunset so we could enjoy both the day and night view. When we arrived we were promptly seated at our table. We both decided to go for their 3-course set menu which also provided us access to the viewing deck after. For the main course I ordered the salmon and the bf ordered the duck we took a bite of each others dishes and boy were they De-lish!. The portions for all three courses was perfect and we were perfectly full and satisfied. 

If you are ever in the Toronto area, it is for sure worth it to check it out and give it a try at least once."}
{"text":"This place cool, did not get a chance to do the off the edge tour. But this is just like an ordinary tall buildings, Empire State, space needle etc. You go up above to get a picture above the city. Must do if you're in the area.

Only reason why I'm giving this restaurant 2 stars is because of the service (360 restaurant server) you will notice the only tables that are taken are the ones by the window (obviously for the view) no want really wants to sit else where unless they are super hungry. So i went up to server, before I can say anything he said \"have a seat it's open seating\". I told him I was aware of that but I asked them if there's anyway I can maybe put my name down for a table by the window (just out of curiosity) he again said \"did you not understand I said it's open seating\"... I just ignored the guy because he was not very hospitable so I just waited next to someone who was about to leave.

I ordered my IPA and a basket of fries to enjoy my view and called it a quick drink above. Servers didn't check up on me once. Had to waive them down for my check and napkins. 

CN tower, the prices you have for your food and restaurant... Tourist don't mind paying the price, but the servers were HORRIBLE, please check up on them make sure they're fit for the position."}
{"text":"It was a bit touristy but the view so spectacular that you barely notice anything but the beautiful scenery. The food was okay not the best, hence the -1 star.  Still worth visiting! They only take reservations!!"}
{"text":"This is not a place for everyday dining, but it is nice to take your out of town guests here.  The $72 prix fixe dinner with comparable a la carte prices is really only about $40 if you consider the rest as admission to the observation tower.  For that price, it is quite good.  Menu options are varied and there were some standouts.   Desserts and appetizers are especially well executed.  I really liked the grilled calamari salad and the hypercaramel pudding.  The pepper steak I ordered was a bit chewy but well flavoured.  Sea food pasta with lobster ordered by some of our party was also a keeper.

Of the decor, what can one say - it is all about the view.  My suggestion would be to make a reservation starting at the last sunlit hour of the day so you can rotate around as the sun goes down and the lights come on.

Service was friendly and fun, but also very considerate.

I will probably return with another out of town guest in May.   The question below about whether they have outdoor seating is a bit humourous, under the circumstances.  Perhaps their next gimmick could involve tables and chairs on bungee cords."}
{"text":"Okay so I had low expectations for this place, but of course had to go as a tourist.  I've heard it's comparable to the Signature Room where you're there for the view and experience and not the food.  And was the food outstanding?  No.  But was it pretty damn good?  Yes.  The experience made up the rest.  The service was pretty average, which was a downside just because it is upscale and I'd expect above average service.  But the view was amazing.  We were there at 7:30 so got a bit of the sunset and then the dark, lit up city.  I quite enjoyed that it turned so you got a different view throughout your meal.  For an app I got the escargot, which was actually really good (so I take back the outstanding comment because this was seriously awesome).  Butter, wine, garlic, cherry tomatoes, pearl onions, bacon, and escargot?  Yes, please.  Anyway, for my entree I got the bison, which the server immediately advised me would only be served rare (which I appreciate, please do not take a wonderful piece of meat and kill it again), so I said fine.  It came out medium rare (which was my preference anyway) and was quite tasty with some pepper crust on it.  The jus in came with actually wasn't.  It tasting like soy sauce or something abrasive and definitely not like the anticipate cabernet jus that was promised on the menu.  However, it was a good bison steak so I didn't need any jus.  Just would have been nice to have some bites with it!  My sister got a pasta dish (vegetarian) which she raved about as well.  We didn't get dessert, but I can comment that the wine list was okay.  They didn't have a large selection by the glass and, since this is more of a tourist place where you'd expect a group that wouldn't necessarily being sharing bottles of wine, I would've expected some more glass options.  Nevertheless, it was a cool experience and decent food and would recommend."}
{"text":"If I'm rating on food alone, this place gets one star. But add another for service, and another for the view, and you come to my rating of three stars.

I can't say I was expecting much from this place, because \"landmark\" restaurants like this (or Top of the Hub in Boston, where I'm from), never really have good food. You come for the view. If that's what you're coming here for, you won't be disappointed.

As other reviewers have said, you skip the huge line for the observation deck, and only pay about $20-$30 more by going to the restaurant, so I suppose that in and of itself is worth it. But don't expect much from the food--the dressing on my Caesar salad was saccharine, the salmon was overcooked with flaccid skin, and the strawberry tart was watery and flavorless. The two steaks my companions ordered were not cooked to order--the medium rare was medium well, and the medium well was well done. But, the view is breathtaking. Our meal took us through one and one half rotations, so we saw the entire skyline, plus, after your meal, you can go downstairs to the observation decks instead of leaving right away.

Service was good; when our waiter (Bee-Jay), learned we were from out of town, he pointed out a few landmarks and suggested a few other attractions to visit.

I'll probably never be back, because I'll probably never visit Toronto again and it's kind of a once-in-a-lifetime place, in my opinion. But, if you're from out of town, I'd recommend going here for the view alone.

Also to note: I thought this would be a dressier place because of the price point and the white tablecloths, but there were tourists here towing strollers, suitcases and even a travel pillow. I wouldn't dress to the nines if you're going to visit."}
{"text":"The only reason why I didn't give the CN Tower a full 5 stars is because of parking.. Even at that... its not even worth taking off a star because the whole experience was magical! (puts 5th star back on...lol)

But let me break it down for you.

Parking: We found parking in a garage right next door to the tower. The only thing is that the walk from the garage to the tower is quite far (in heels) and is a bit of struggle fighting threw the hundreds of tourists trampling into doors and elevators. 

Lucky us since we made dinner reservations ahead of time, we were able to pass all the lines and go straight to the restaurant. Before you enter the elevator that's separate from the main elevator, you get you photo taken and sit in an open waiting room with a grand piano (perfect selfie spot) 

Restaurant: LADIES BEWARE! If you are wearing heels, be very careful and watch your step. Since this is a rotating restaurant, the floors move so it can make you feel a little dizzy walking to the wash room. As for the salads, entrees and wine, all of it was A1! Absolutly delectable. Since we went for my birthday, My partner made a side note with our reservation and requested a special birthday surprise. The server was absolutely awesome! He lit the candle right behind me without me even noticing and the whole time my partner never gave away what was going on. When I was given my surprise, I actually started crying lol It was the sweetest thing on earth and I loved that the 360 restaurant went above and beyond to fulfill their customers requests.


Scenery: I haven't seen it at night but during the day... ABSOLUTLY WORTH IT!!!!"}

The menu is really great, but if you've got a nut allergy, you won't get to eat anything you couldn't get at a 100 other restaurants. Very disappointing!

Long Review:
Yes. It's touristy. But, hey, I'm a tourist this week! Had to try it - and compare the experience to the Space Needle. And....my experience was very disappointing. First off, I ordered one of the best Sauvignon Blancs I've ever had: 2016 Big Head (Niagara, ON). Outstanding! After that, I had really high hopes for dinner. 

So the dinner is either prix fix or a la carte - at prix fix prices. Either way, you aren't getting out of here under $65 CAD per person. I was looking at shrimp n grits, and the pumpkin & ricotta ravioli. Doesn't that sound absolutely fabulous??!! Well - unfortunately almost everything on the menu has nuts of some kind in it, so I wasn't able to get either. Instead I had a caesar salad with glazed bacon bits and parmesan (yawn) and salmon over a bed of creamy savoy cabbage (boring).  I can't tell you how disappointed I was in my meal. Especially after getting that premium wine. 

3 stars for the friendly service, great ambiance, great views. Minus 2 for the thoughtless menu!"}
{"text":"The food at 360 is really great. I got the beet and goat cheese tart, sesame crusted salmon, and apple vanilla crumble for dessert. The tart was very good, the salmon was cooked to perfection! (although I wasn't a fan of the soba noodles that it came with). My boyfriend ordered the lobster, muscle and corn chowder. GET THE CHOWDER it was HEAVEN! 

The food and wine was great and the view of Toronto at night was really nice. There really isn't a bad seat in the place, although the tables are very close together.

Our server was very attentive. Obviously the prices were 'up there' but for a special night out it was really great."}
{"text":"The reviews for this restaurant are extremely mixed but I honestly have to say that I came here just for the amazing view.  

To go up the CN Tower, you can either pay around $35 (after tax) or you can choose to dine at the 360 restaurant.  We ended up deciding on dining at the restaurant since the price difference between a meal and the ticket itself was not too off.  

Since we weren't too hungry, we decided to order mostly entrees and ended up paying around $48-55 per person.  The three-course prix fixe is around $65 (almost $80 after tax+tip) so we decided to be a bit frugal, as most students are.  We didn't regret our choice because our mains were fairly large, and they provided lots of complimentary bread. 

The salmon dish was honestly nothing special but I did enjoy the butternut squash potato mash, as it was an interesting take on traditional mashed potatoes.  My entree was definitely not worth $48 (after tax and tip) but because we did not have to pay the $35 CN Tower elevation fee, we felt that it was justifiable.  In the end, we spent roughly an hour and a half in the dining area, allowing us to enjoy our meal with a 360 degree view, and then we spent another hour at the look out area."}
{"text":"Elegance at its finest. Our waiter was uber friendly and accommodating  (charged my perpetually dying phone) & and was very helpful  after explaining I had a gift card of a certain amount and would  like to get the full bang for my buck without going over (the epitome of balling on a budget). At a place like this you would think the staff would turn up their nose after hearing something like that...they didnt. 

We ordered the 3 course prix fix meals with the 8oz wine pairings AND still had money left over. The view was breathtaking, food was not a disappointment (however didnt fall to my knees and  thank the heavens),add a charming staff and I would def go back.  The experience  is worth it when visiting Toronto.  Also our waiter gave us tips on where to go for some dancing even busted out a map for easy navigation (still got lost  but that is due to the no sense of direction defect I have). The Waiter was so amazing my mind erased his name...Probably for the best I dont like sharing! 

Oh yeah if it was obvious this restaurant rotates! The only other one I've been to was the Marquis in Times Square New York and I must say...T.O. version wins and moved a bit at a faster pace."}
{"text":"The view is superb during the night time. I went during the daytime and it was still nice. The ambiance was great with amazing staffs. The food is great but we are mostly paying for the view."}
{"text":"Awful!!!! I went to the 360 restaurant to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday (he's never been before) The hostesses were very friendly. We sat down and waited for 20 minutes nobody greeted us and when someone came over and asked us if we wanted something to drink and we said no thank you their response was \"OK bye\" my boyfriend and I stared at each other awkwardly and were so appalled that we both wanted to leave the restaurant we couldn't believe how terrible that server was. We packed up our belongings and headed to the exit to tell the hostess that we are very unhappy and that we are leaving she insisted that we speak to a manager and a good thing we did and that's when things started to turn around, the manager apologized sincerely and he said that he would take care of us (he ended up being our server) he really did turn the night around for us and and it up making my boyfriends birthday special. 

The food/ was gross but like everybody says \"you're going there for the view not for the food\"

I would suggest that the 360 restaurants hires  friendly servers since we are paying such high prices to eat there it would be nice to have someone who enjoys their job as a server"}
{"text":"The food is to die for and the waiters/ waitresses are very nice!! I love the beauty of the restaurant rotating very slowly so you can see all of Toronto. The floor even rotates too. One of the coolest restaurants EVER!!"}
{"text":"Despite this being a tourist destination, the restaurant within the tower exceeded my expectations. 

Our server, Juan, was attentive, polite, and knowledgeable with the menu offerings. The timing between our courses was perfect.

We all ordered from the 3 course prixe fix menu:
My starter was the house smoked salmon and it was divine - not fishy or oily at all and very balanced flavors
My entree was the Taste of Fogo Island which was scrumptious, however I was a bit annoyed with having to de-shell my own crab legs - they were half open but still a bit cumbersome to wiggle the meat out of.
My dessert was the Carrot and Quinoa Cake...very moist and I only wished there was more cinnamon ice cream. 

The dishes were elegantly presented and seasoned well. The ingredients maintained their individuality against the many accoutrements on the plate served alongside or atop them.

My mom's appetizer was the Romaine and Kale salad, which, having bacon lardons on it, was phenomenal. You wouldn't have even needed dressing.
My mom had the steak (yummy, and with horseradish on the side!), cooked to a nice medium with a nice sprinkling of salt.
Her dessert was an underwhelming Rhubarb and Strawberry Crumble.

(I'm getting tired of typing but my brother's meal was also quite good. )"}
{"text":"Tried to call the restaurant at least 15 times starting the day before to make reservations and the line keeps ringing and ringing. No one answered and no recording. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!"}
{"text":"The view was good, came for a team lunch. They had a set lunch for 2 courses $56 or 3 courses $69? 

The rabbit tenderloine was very good and flavourful as for the lamb shank, it was a bit dry. I opted out of the dessert as the 2 courses was very filling already. 

My friend had a pumpkin cheesecake but he said it was a bit weird, not bad tasting though"}
{"text":"Really fun to spin and eat.  Great food and service.  I like how they include the free tickets for the observation deck.  The fixed course meal was more than I could eat.  It's a great way to experience the city and enjoy good food at the same time."}
{"text":"While in Toronto we booked reservations at the 360 restaurant inside the CN Tower. The view is amazing. The restaurant revolves slowly in a circle so you can view the city in its entirety. It takes 72 minutes to complete 1 full circle. The food was not bad, but not worth the price. It was 4 of us and we had 1 drink each... the bill was $500 (with tip) and we found the food to be just ok. If you've never done a revolving restaurant, I say do it, but just be prepared to pay."}
{"text":"Had a great birthday dinner here with the bf. The prices are steep but it includes entrance to the CN Tower so it balances out. The food was good, or at least, most of it. But the one reason I would definitely come back again is the view... nothing beats it. 

As for the food, we ordered the $75 prix fixe menu and chose the Sesame Crusted BC Albacore Tuna, East Coast Clam Chowder, Alberta AAA Pepppered Striploin Steak, and Maple Syrup Three Ways, as well as the Grand Platter. The starters and dessert were meh, but the steak was quite good. The Grand Platter was also quite nice, though the mussels were on the really small side. The menu says the Grand Platter is an ideal meal for one but our server said it's too much food for one person and he was right."}
{"text":"Great view. That's a given. The food was expensive. That's a given. But the food was also very good, better than I expected actually. Total bill with tax and tip was $100 for 2 people for lunch."}
{"text":"$80 Canadian per person was really a rip-off. You had no choice whether or not you wanted to eat they would charge you $80 a person and they had a table minimum. The wine selection was decent and the food was horrible. I would never come back here for the food but I will come back for the view. The view is absolutely impeccable I love the rotating restaurant however the food was disgusting. The service was great and our waiter was very intentive. But the food was definitely the worst. I would come back for the view but definitely not for the food. Expect to spend $80 to $100 a person because that is the lowest price that they have and everything else is extra."}
{"text":"To most, 360 Restaurant is probably one of those spots you check out and say, \"been there, done that\".  I read the reviews on Yelp so I knew the do's and dont's like not eating here because it was overpriced and the food is average at best.  So we decided to just have a snack and a few drinks.  Definitely the BEST VIEW of Toronto!  The restaurant rotates (a full rotation per hour) so it does live up to the name....360 degree view of the city!  

You have to spend about $50 per person to get free access to the Observation Deck.  They say you have to order an entree per person but you can just get drinks, you just have to get a few.  

-Bottle of sparkling was mid-40s to $$$$.  
-Cocktails were $6-8
-Bottled beers were about $7
-Cappucino $5, Double Expresso $9
-Tower Platter $190 (very pricey but they give you a HUGE tower of fresh seafood which includes lobster, crab legs, etc.)

I'd definitely come back here for drinks next time I'm in town!  I live in LA so the drink prices at 360 is very reasonable to me considering you're also paying for the view."}
{"text":"I figure I should probably update my review. I am older and wiser, or so the rumour goes.

I would never come here on my own, but I would definitely recommend bringing a visitor to Toronto here. Whenever I am hosting someone from out of town, I make sure to bring them by 360. Because really, unless they've been to the burj khalifa in Dubai, chances are they haven't been this high up before (airplanes don't count because you're trapped in a torture device of a seat that only masochists would enjoy).

The food, expectedly, is overpriced; but only slightly so, which is surprising. Tip: bring them for lunch. The prix fixe price is much more reasonable than the one for dinner, and the food is not bad. And plus, during the afternoon, the sun is still up so you can enjoy seeing the actual city while revolving in the restaurant. It's a win-win.

And it's hardly a secret by now, but if you have a reservation here, there will be no charge to ascend the tower. Seeing as regular admission is like $20, it's a great steal."}
{"text":"Pros:
The view is awesome

Cons:
Food is not worth the price
Service was slow even when there was only one table besides ourselves
Portions were not enough
The escargot was dismal

3 stars because although the restaurant has excellent views, you might as well go to the tower observation deck for a lot less money and get the same 360 view."}
{"text":"Has a quite good set menu, with an amazing view of Toronto and Lake Ontario."}
{"text":"I realize that the food at the restaurant is mediocre at best but it's just such a great place to bring an out-of-towner.  What a better way to show them how beautiful Toronto is?  

A reservation at 360 Restaurant means that you don't have to pay to get up.  Although the caveat is that you are only allowed to go up about an hour before your reservation, which doesn't make any sense to me because what if my entourage wants to have pre-dinner drinks?  The answer to that question is that we would then have to pay to get up if we wanted drinks, according to the reservation desk.  I have a really poor opinion of the reservation desk actually because my party arrived at different times and each time the lady struggled to find my reservation.

The server at the restaurant was very attentive however, and very charming too.  I had their oysters as an appetizer and it was good and I hear that their seafood is usually a hit."}
{"text":"If you decide to dine here, come with patience. We waited 10 minutes for the elevator and 15 minutes after that to be seated. Service was okay. I ordered the prime rib at an up charge. My medium rare came out well done and was bland. Prices for wine by the bottle are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Decent place definitely with great service! FOOD is OK, umm, more than OK. BUT this is the REVOLVING restaurant in top of CN TOWER, window tables' view is worthy that money."}
{"text":"I cannot give a valid review
because i never got to eat here
I MADE reservations almost a month prior, for my boyfriends birthday
they said no problem, took my name and number, told ME the time to come, and that was that..wonderful right? NO
i called the morning of the evening i was supossed to be going and they said they didnt have my reservation written down
i said let me spek to a manager and the girl said (rudely) hes busy and he says he cant accomidate you
i had to find somewhere else to go the night of and everywhere nice was booked
i was VERY disappointed in the lack of professionalism and responsibility of emplyees here

CALL A WEEK IN ADVANCE TO CONFIRM, SO THAT THEY DONT STIFF YOU"}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect but what a fabulous dinner! Raging snowstorm but still able to see the incredible views. Kelly Chang was our waiter, fabulous guy & very attentive. I had lamb chops & hubby had steak & lobster. Perfection! Side dishes are so yummy. Wine list is stellar. Pricey but for a special occasion, just do it!!! Will definitely go back when in Canada again."}
{"text":"This is one of the regular spots I'll take my fiancee for her birthday. The staff is always friendly, they make you feel comfortable and are attentive and knowledgeable about what's on the menu. You can't beat the view, and factor that in with the quality of the food and I think it's a very good value."}
{"text":"We took full advantage to our edge walk experience and a day later, we used our ticket to skip the line up to the restaurant. We came in at dusk, and lucked out getting a table for 2 alongside the window. 

The 360 restaurant was a completely beautiful experience. Our server was incredibly nice and knew the menu. The nighttime view was breathtaking and we got to see all the arteries of the city, which added to the great time we had over dinner. 

The cheapest half bottle of wine was pleasant and our heirloom tomato salad was insanely tasty!! Recommended by our server and it is something you can't pass up. We got the pan roasted duck as our main and was plenty filling. There was attention to detail on everything that made it on the plate. 

Definitely an excellent evening to be had here!! 

(**we did not have to wait in line for the elevator, and you must plan ahead and have a reservation made weeks in advance)"}
{"text":"It was a clear Saturday night. The view of Toronto was beautiful. The only point is that sometimes you feel a bit light-headed because of the spinning, esp if you're focusing on a close building. 

On the way to the restaurant tho, it took a while to get there. We entered the entrance and they made us go through some security checkpoint where they blew air at us. Staff also stopped us multiple times to take group pictures that they wanted us to purchase afterward ($20 for a picture....way too expensive).

I got the prix-fixe menu. For my small bite, i ordered the spiced shrimp. It was okay, but it was hard to eat in a single bite. For my appetizer, i ordered the smoked atlantic salmon. It was good. The caper berries really complimented the fresh salmon. For my entree, i ordered the peppered striploin steak. It was okay. There are better strips i've tried (like Strip House in New York), but i also understand that this place isn't a steakhouse. I asked for medium rare and it was cooked unevenly. One side was cooked medium rare, while the other 1/2 was cooked medium. The potatoes and spinach tasted well. The best part of my meal was the dessert. I ordered the Cinnamon Bread Pudding, and it was great. I devoured it."}
{"text":"Went here for an early valentines dinner with my wife yesterday. Amazing view, the food was okay. Nothing special. Wine menu can be a bit expensive.

Would go back though once in awhile. Their food pricing is 35-120 pp without drinks depending on what you get."}
{"text":"Food was good and service was just average, and of course overpriced for such a small portion.  Overall, the only thing that needs to be said about the restaurant is that people pay the money for the view.  Sure it's a nice restaurant and the food was tasty, but if it weren't for the view and that it was a part of the CN Tower, you wouldn't see that many people going here."}
{"text":"The view is obviously the main attraction here. We waited an extra 30 minutes to get a table near the window and they didn't mind at all to hold our reservation. The beef tenderloin was good but they brought us the wrong food twice. The risotto was just okay, it needed quite a bit of salt. I'd recommend it for the view, but the food could be a little better."}
{"text":"Simply awesome!  This is THE way to see the CN Tower. Food was great. Atmosphere was better. Wait staff is attentive. May seem like a high price for the meals, but when you consider that you get to go to the observation deck as well, it's worth the price!"}
{"text":"Had prix fixe, 3 courses for $50 or so. Food was great, though not outstanding, and a bit forgettable. Types of dishes offered were not suprising for the price point - including terrine, smoked salmon, chicken liver, braised beef. However, the view of Toronto on a clear day was just outstanding - this is why you go here. Service was a bit slow and disinterested, so don't come here if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"As many people have said, the CN Tower 360 Restaurant is more worthwhile for the view than the food. It was a great experience that I would go back again with someone who wanted to see the CN tower, but not for the food. 

First off, I went on a Sunday, at 1:45 PM, so the CN tower and this restaurant wasn't quite as crowded as it could be. We requested window seats in the reservation and they gave them to us without a fuss. We had to sit in the waiting area for maybe 5 minutes while they got our table ready-- but that wasn't a bad thing since they had little hard candies that were pretty yummy. 

At the table, we spent a long time just watching planes take off from Toronto Island, and trying to identify the surrounding city. We ordered (the waiters are very efficient and some were very unhappy if you try to ask them to take a picture of you) and then got some bread to eat. The bread came out cold, but was still pretty good. 

For appetizer, I got the chowder and my partner got the mushroom bruschetta. The chowder was nothing special, but the bruschetta was a actually pretty delicious. 

For entree, I got the chicken and my partner got the strozzapreti. My chicken was a bit bland and dry, with uninspiring grilled vegetables underneath. I didn't taste any truffle or enough salt in the dish. I ended up not eating most of the chicken and saving it for stuffing into a sandwich with some tomato and sauce. 

The strozzapreti was also pretty simple, but a bit more flavorful once you mixed in the eggplant mixture and cheese. There was a lot of tomato and wild mushrooms in the dish, and if you ate each bite of pasta with some tomato, it was actually pretty delicious. 

The dessert was probably the highlight of the meal. I got a dark chocolate tower and my partner got a warm cranberry pecan tart. The chocolate tower was a tower of chocolate mousse drizzled with hard chocolate and sprinkled with orange peels, served next to some mandarin slices. The mousse wasn't quite as melt-in-your-mouth delicious as I'd expected, but it went pretty well with the orange peel. The cranberry tart was actually delicious, with a crust that tasted like shortbread, sour bite from the cranberry, and pecan-y crunch from the candied pecans. 

After lunch, we walked down to the observation deck and glass floor, wandered around, and then proceeded downstairs. The only downside is that this meal does not get you entrance into the 4D movie after you arrive on the ground floor, but that's a small gripe. Overall, $55 for a decent meal and trip to the CN tower glass floor was worth it."}
{"text":"We visited the CN Tower with overseas friends and decided to give a try to dine here. OVERpriced!!!! Ordered 20oz steak costs $80 too bad only AAA grade, no veggies whatsoever on the plate so we paid extra for asparagus & fries on the side. We also ordered $90 seafood platter which serves cold including smoke salmon, some cooked fish, mussels,  QUEEN crab legs, oysters and lobster. It was so so. We bought our own wine but was told by the waitress 360 restaurant DOES NOT have license to serve as we bought our own wine. 

Went down for smoke and the staff on the ground level reception did not let us go back up as the security already off work. We were blamed for not telling the restaurant manager to get PERMISSION to go back up.  No further assistance by the tower staff or restaurant's reception. Without getting a chance to see the glass deck, we waited everyone to come down and without finishing all the food on the table we left."}
{"text":"The view was spectacular. You get to see all of the Financial and the Downtown area. The food was okayish and the desert is not that good. I'm not recommending you to buy the three course thing which cost $11 more. Overall, nice view okayish food and terrible desert"}
{"text":"Let's discuss economics, shall we?

Mmmkay.

If it costs $24 to go up an elevator to land you at a place where you must wait in line and then have to fight gobs of people to get a decent picture of the skyscrapers of downtown Toronto...

or...

It costs you $36 for an overpriced (obvi) piece of gourmet fish or chicken with some sides with free access to the other floors, not having to wait in line, sitting in a rotating room while eating your delicious meal...

which would you choose?

You're essentially paying $12 (okay, tax and tip... don't hound me) for lunch.

The food was good and the scenery was spectacular and we didn't have to be crowded by paparazzi all trying to fight for the best picture in every nook of the skydeck area.

If we went back and decided we needed another trip up the ol' building? We'd have an overpriced lunch (hey, it's all overpriced anyway!) at the top of the CN tower and do it all again."}
{"text":"The top of the tower restaurant was packed so I wasn't able to get in, but 360 was taking walk-ins and I think I know why.  For the price, the food was somewhat disappointing, service was good and the view/ambiance is very nice.  If you're taking a trip and want to eat up there in the CN Tower I'd probably skip out on 360."}
{"text":"I give two stars for the view only. The attitude of the server was very terrible because I was NOT satisfied with the dish he presented. The dish was made for at least 4 people and he did not warn us how big the dish it would be. Aside from the size of the dish, the taste is beyond horrible. I grew up eating oyster and I immediately noticed how unhealthy the color and the taste of the oyster was. We asked him to bring us a plate of fresh cracked oyster after the complain and this time he actually brought us fresh oyster and it looked completely different from the oyster he gave us originally. Also the muscles were empty, literally. We found more than 15 shells and they were all empty.. where did my muscles go? The salmon is smoked and baked and tastes very dry. Over all the service was ok and the food I give it 1.8/10"}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant for the view and what you pay for is definitely what you get! It is beautiful up in the restaurant, and the rotation gives you a full view of all of Toronto that the restaurant downstairs doesn't provide.

The food itself was very good, but extremely overpriced. The portions were also pretty small. Usually I'm not able to finish a whole entree but at 360 I was able to finish that and an appetizer! Plus I only had lunch 3-4 hours prior! However, eating at 360 means you don't have to pay the entrance fee to the CN Tower itself, so it's worth it as far as I know!

The waitstaff is very friendly, and although they messed up the orders a bit, it wasn't too big of a fiasco.

All in all, 360 is a great place to go, especially if you're willing to splurge a bit on dinner!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant almost on a whim while visiting Toronto. 

The good - the view is absolutely spectacular. For that alone (and the uniqueness of the experience) I don't at all regret going there. The wine list is also pretty extensive though overpriced. Finally, the tower dessert was pretty tasty. 

The mediocre - the food (and overpriced). My steak was bland and not even seasoned. It was also poorly cooked - seemed like they were really missing on the proper technique to cook steak. The appetizer was also mediocre. 

The service was overall slow though our lady was attentive.

Basically I think fine dining is an exaggeration for this place. More like a mid-range food with over-the-top prices and a phenomenal view. Worth doing once."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner. It was on a busy Saturday night - booked reservation 3 weeks in advance. Anyways we ascend to the top and arrived a few minutes early so they suggested we visit the observation deck and come back later - I noticed it was way too busy in the restaurant. The observation area was a nice preview before dinner although. We get seated by the window and it can be a little tight but it was welcoming. Some of the servers were dismissive, others were more attentive. Ordered the 3 course for $79 - was excellent. Went with the romaine caesar salad for appetizer, risotto for entree, and a dark chocolate tower for dessert. We chose 2 sides, fries and asparagus, and complimentary bread was a nice touch - smooth whipped butter included. 4/5 because it was incredibly busy so it was a longer dinner, although I was in no rush! I had a great birthday dinner."}
{"text":"I had my birthday dinner here last weekend and have to say it was an awesome experience! Everything I ate was delicious! They have an amazing wine selection and don't even get me started with the view!! The view of downtown and the entire city of Toronto is amazing!! This place isn't cheap, but it's worth every penny to check out while you're in town or to celebrate a birthday or anniversary!"}
{"text":"The only thing you should go for to this place is the view. Food was ok but staff weren't friendly, even rude"}
{"text":"I asked for a window seat on my reservation and that was ignored, for a \"high end\" restaurant I felt that the service and attention to detail was lacking, you will probably get a better experience somewhere else for the money you'll spend here. The server was trying to carry too much and in the process his fingers were in the butter he brought with the bread, I had to scrapped the top of the butter to avoid hepatitis C. The food was decent. If it wasn't for the novelty of seeing the city from above in a rotating circle, I would have skipped this place."}
{"text":"The cost of eating here is definitely pricey, but the food is really good. I recommend the prix fix menu. The options are good for $60. My wife and  I both ordered the sesame crusted salmon for our main course. She ordered the duck salad for the first course and I ordered the roasted beets tart. Both were delicious. For dessert, I ordered the apple crumb, which is apples, crumbs and cinnamon ice cream. My wife had the dark chocolate tower, which was extremely delicious.

After dinner, you simply walk down two flights to the observation deck. The cost of the observation deck is $32. This is included when you dine at the restaurant. I think it's worth the cost because the food is really good and the experience is great. You're eating good food and overlooking the entire Toronto region in a restaurant that spins.

My only complaint stems from the picture you take before you are escorted up the CN Tower to the restaurant. While you're eating, the staff come up to your table with pictures in hand asking if you wish to purchase. It's overkill considering they provide you with a ticket to view your pictures AFTER you dine. I don't want to be coerced to make a purchase while I'm eating.

Overall, if you're in Toronto and you don't mind spending a decent amount of money on food and a view above Toronto, I highly recommend 360."}
{"text":"Yes.  The view is amazing.  We go annually and enjoy the view.  It's one of the few times it's ok to sit quietly at dinner and suspend conversation once in a while just to stare out the window.  It's nice to watch the sun set and see the city lights.

As for the food, we usually enjoy it.  We haven't had a meal where we were disappointed.  It's a bit on the pricey side, but the menu is interesting.  I almost always end up picking the vegetarian entrée - it\s usually the most interesting dish.  

Yes it's pricey, but it does include the trip up the CN Tower and a visit to the observation decks, which makes for a nice stroll after dinner.

If cost is a factor, you can always redeem for a gift certificate for a prix fixe dinner through the AIR MILES Reward Program.  Hey, it's a free dinner!!"}
{"text":"LOVED the CN tower! We lucked out and got same day dinner reservations for four at 6:30, requested a table by the window, and got it! (Tip: request a table by the window!!) 

Food isn't the best (prime rib, seafood appetizer, a bottle of wine) and it is pricey but we're really all here for the view - which is absolutely stunning! It takes 72 minutes for the floor to spin around the entire city and boy is it worth it. For dinner, there are 2course, 3 course,  and a la carte options too! 

We also have complimentary access to the observation deck and got to skip all the lines. 

We were looking for a fun activity that my grandma could enjoy (walking is tough on the knees) and I think this will be the highlight of her trip to Toronto!"}
{"text":"Don't even necessarily think of it as a restaurant. If your time is worth more than $25 an hour to you, then the fact that you can skip the line for the elevator if you have a reservation basically pays for the meal (and the view is better from the restaurant because the windows aren't covered in fingerprints and face smudges).

The prix fixe meal can easily last 2 hours (portions are large) so don't be discouraged if the only spots open are for 5pm- by the time you are done eating it will be nearly sunset and you'll get the best of both views."}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience. Obviously it's got a great view. Best time to go I think is about 45 minutes from sunset, so you can get the a nice view of the city and lake while the suns up, get to see the beautiful sunset colors, and then a stunning nighttime city skyline. Every dish was melt-in-your-mouth delecious, and they have a vast wine collection (and he highest wine cellar in the world). This is a perfect spot for an anniversary or birthday, night be a little expensive for a date, but I'll leave that up to you."}
{"text":"This a departure from the norm from me. Never have I been soo impressed with the staff at any dining establishment, let alone one that is a tourist attraction. 

Our waiter was so personable, and extremely thoughtful! At first i thought it was because I looked so good that night, but as it turns out, my friend had plied him with a glass of our wine ( it was $200 and I certainly wasn't drinking it, so why let it go to waste?!) We ended up getting an Amorone '04, and it opened up quite nicely.

As for for the food...you know your walking into a tourist attration and your basically paying for the breathtaking view. We actually saw a falling star/meteor/something shiny and colorful that had the entire section oooh'ing in awe. He took delight in giving me a tour of the Toronto skyline while i have to admit I was envisioning my beloved NY in its place, but he doesnt have to know that. But I digress. I went with the duck and rabbit combo, he got the rack of lamb, and the lamb was DELICIOUS! I''ve had better game in my day, but it was still tasty.  The sommelier(?) even paid a visit to give us a wine tasting and find how we liked his selection. 

But the waiter totally earned his tip. He knew I was fond of chocolate and smuggled the double chocolate gelato and ice cream onto my apple and sour cherry crisp ( reallly great end to a meal).

The only gripe I have, aside from it being severely overpriced, is the noise level. And the annoying flashes that occasionally blinded me ( seriously people?!?). Not to mention the skimpt menu."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this restaurant. It was very fancy and had a great view. We got a good price for dinner and the service was exceptional! Definitely will come back in the future:)"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Great view! It's quite expensive, but you get a free ride up, although not to the very top."}
{"text":"Took my mother and mother in law here for Mother's Day dinner. The food was absolutely amazing. None of us had a complaint. The drinks were also good and some even came with a souvenir glass. The view was astonishing. My parents loved it. We will definitely head back when we visit Toronto again. Getting to explore the tower for free was also a plus. The place is quite expensive but it worth every penny especially for special occasions."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where the view is better than the food.  It's all hype and advertising to go to the \"finest\" restaurant.... where the food is mediocre.  View is nice though!"}
{"text":"Oh my, how did I miss sharing my opinion about the 360 Restaurant! Ok, short version - politically correct:

If you'll book a table at 360, you will not have to pay for entrance to the tower, yet able to explore it. Yahoo!

Now a bit longer version, for those who are curious. This restaurant is a worst part of the best Toronto attraction. It is ridiculously, idiotically expensive. Portions are small and food is far from being delightful. I would not call it crap but it comes close.

And for the same amount of money (think hundred per person) you may be able to eat a bliss of a meal down there in the city. Service is not worth mentioning, because it is barely present. Yes, they will bring your food, you darned tourist.

There are more expensive \"rotating restaurants in the tower\", for example the one in Moscow. There are more scenic, for example the one in Berlin. There are cozy ones, such  as Atlanta' Sun Dial, or cute ones - like that in the bulge of Calgary tower. What can you possibly forget in the CN Tower' restaurant, except for saving money for the entrance, is beyond my imagination.

An honest and sincere word of advice: Buy the regular admission tickets, better bundled for a couple of attractions, and enjoy the beautiful view from the CN tower. Check out the glass floor and walk around the open balcony. Then go down, choose the best restaurant you'll find and enjoy your meal. You will get some marvellous food and gorgeous view for the same price, without wasting your money on 360 Restaurant."}
{"text":"The only reason to eat here is the view, but even that may not be worth it. The food was not the tastiest for the price. You expect quality, definitely a one time experience."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic waiter (George) who was very personable and knowledgeable. It was nice that they have a \"relaxed\" philosophy so you don't feel rushed. The portions were very reasonable, as it wasn't so much that you had to take some home. Only took a star away because the food was good, but not really \"five star\". Your money is definitely for the views. 
This was definitely a great experience for a couple of out of towners like us!"}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday lunch. We thought the cost of taking just the elevator to the observation deck was worth eating a nice lunch here. You don't have a choice really to get the price fix meal - we did the appetizer and entree no desert option. You have to get used to the windows and what not spinning a little - I initially felt a little queasy. Our server actually seated us and there isn't a bad seat in the house because the restaurant spins - giving you a view of every direction. 

For food my husband and I chose the scallops and Cesar salad and the spareribs and pork chop. The appetizers came out very quick. The scallops had great presentation, but my husband said they didn't taste fresh and lacked flavor - some salt and pepper would have been nice. My Cesar was decent - good size, but needed pepper, which I had the ask the waitress for. Don't most nice restaurants have the pepper mill with them when they drop off salads? Unfortunately, the salad was probably the best part of the meal. I had just about finished when the entrees came - wasn't even able to eat my last slice of lettuce to make room for the entrees. My husband said the spare ribs were okay, they were tender and had a nice side of potatoes and root veggies. I had a bite and again, they kind of lacked flavor. My pork chop - the presentation was great. But when I took the first bite, I felt it was over smoked and the meat itself was overwhelmed by it. The waitress came by right after my first bite and asked me how it was. I said it was okay and immediately, she was on me to ask if I wanted a different entree. It was rough to tell from the first bite, but the second was just okay too. So the waitress came back again and offered to switch it out. I chose the chicken, although I am not sure how good I feel about paying that much for mediocre chicken. While we were there, I observed two other tables in our section that sent food back - I feel like this is a common occurrence here. After the entree, the waitress disappeared for a while and we never were asked about refills on our sodas/drinks nor able to see if there might be a complimentary treat for my birthday. 

I definitely think this is a one time only thing that you can definitely skip. The two stars are really just for the view that you can see just as well from the observation deck."}
{"text":"It's super pretty up there! But the food was limited and mediocre. The alcohol was fine. The customer service was extremely lacking. I've never had a worst experience than this. We waiting almost an hour for our waiter to come to us after we were already seated and ready to order. It took another 45 minutes just for food but, it wasn't even that busy. Our waiter was also not attentive. My friends usually tip bad waiters but, this was the worst one we have ever had. He was not polite or nice and really put us at the bottom of his list. My friends didn't tip him, and it's kind of awkward because he was there as they signed for the payment and clearly looked at how he was getting No tip so he sighed, rolled his eyes, nodded his head, then threw my friends' debit cards at them. I would understand if he was great or even mediocre and they didn't tip him, and then he acted like that. But he was terrible! There was nothing amazing or even mediocre that he did, he was just straight up terrible. You get what you give so I don't understand why he thought he deserved a tip. I saw how he reacted so I did tip him. He of course had his eyes glued to see the tip amount then just handed me my card and told me to have a good night, not my friends. If you work in the customer service industry, I think he should've just had great customer service from the top. But he didn't. Also, he shouldn't have acted the way he did when he saw that he had not gotten a tip. Yes, the Buisness he is in, is difficult but as a professional he shouldn't have acted out. I've worked in customer service before and I would not have ever acted the way he did."}
{"text":"A decent meal, but ultimately, you're paying for the view. I was underwhelmed by the food, which isn't to say it was bad. I don't know if this is how Caesar salad is frequently done in high-end restaurants, but I thought it tasted awful, and would prefer that it came properly assembled. The trio of pork was quite disappointing. Not an inexpensive meal, but that's to be expected given the location. I'm sure the view is wonderful, but unfortunately fog obscured the view entirely on our visit."}
{"text":"Food was ok, I've definitely had better. I completely expected to be a bit underwhelming, it's typically the case with these places. You truly just pay for the experience.

The experience was great. I enjoyed the fact that the seats actually rotated so you can see the entire city. The view is absolutely amazing. 

Our waiter was also worth the experience. 

Now, the reason I only give this place 3 stars is because of the host Megan. She was rude and not friendly at all. I asked her a question and she turned her back on me, without acknowledging that she heard my question. As the first person to Greet guest, you should be pleasant."}
{"text":"1. You need advance reservations .
2. Its a little pricey (dinner for two with two
Glasses of wine each , two course meal, coffee and tip was about $225 us.)
3  you might have a problem if you are afraid of heights .

Very worth doing at least once. The view is amazing  and the food and very good . We sat In a table right next to the window which as nice . They suggest business casual dress but many people were dressed very casually (sneakers and shorts )."}
{"text":"La vue, la vue, la vue. Il faut y aller pour ces 3 raisons!
Ça n'est pas beaucoup plus cher que le ticket d'entrée à la tour, ça permet d'éviter la looooongue file d'attente, c'est pas mal. La nourriture est correcte, si on ne prends aucun extra. Dès qu'on ajoute un verre de vin, ça monte très très vite! Mais ça reste une super expérience, à renouveler"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you simply have to say you have been to. 

The views of Toronto are simply magnificent. If you come here at night, expect to be dazzled by the lights of the city. All while enjoying an amazing meal with whichever company you happen to bring. 

Food is good, service was nice when I was here and of course it is expensive. Expect to order lots while you're here. Make the most of the experience."}
{"text":"If you are only there for the view then this place is 5 stars. Unfortunately for the good...it's not even mediocre. The cutlery, dishes and the placemats were really worn out. I just had high expectations from this place. The toasted Mushrooms and onions soup was really bad. The soup was room temperature, with no flavour. I barely had a few bites. Our server was nice enough to offer me a complimentary salad because I barely ate the soup. For our second course, i ordered ancient grains risotto and my hubby order Atlantic salmon filet. His  entree was ok. The risotto needed more seasoning, it was edible though. Surprisingly the dessert was amazing, it was perfect. The dark chocolate tower was really smooth and delicious. I'm giving this place a three because of service and dessert."}
{"text":"The prixe fix menus are usually your best bet.  Appetizer, entree, dessert for about 50 dollars.

The trek up to this restaurant is not worth the food they serve.  Parking is expensive and far away.  Once you park you need to walk all the way over to the lobby, then you need to walk up the ramp, around the hall, and up a long elevator.

This restaurant \"revolves.\"  And by \"revolve\" I mean that it doesn't actually revolve.  The building is stationary with a revolving platform on the edges.  You sit on this platform and watch the world go round.

The food is good, but better good can be had elsewhere.  The service is slow, but you have a 360 view of the city so you're not supposed to notice.

It's great for tourists, but repeat customers are a rarity."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a nice (albeit expensive) tourist experience, the CN Tower's 360 restaurant is a good choice.  If, however, you are looking for a good dining experience (3 course dinner for $79 C) and meal move on to your next choice.

The view is amazing and in the hands of different proprietors could be an exceptional restaurant (think Windows on the World, may it rest in peace).  Unfortunately, it is not.  First, as you approach the elevators, you are asked to pose in front of a green screen for your souvenir photos.  The elevator ride up the tower is spectacular.  Then you enter the room, which is tired (if a Holiday Inn and PF Changs had a baby, it would look like this), but serviceable.  

The crowd was almost 100% tourists.  Nothing wrong with that, except it says the locals know better.  Some were attired for a nice venue, some did not take off their hats.  Everyone was as focused on taking selfies and pics of their companions against the views as having dinner.

The staff is pleasant enough, but the entire experience was somewhere between a ticketed ride -- you actually have a ticket to get up to the restaurant -- and good diner.  Food presentation was nice.  I ordered the rabbit with pappardelle for my entree.   The dish came to the table cool.  I sent it back and they were very gracious about it, giving me a fresh plate.  Once hot, I tasted the pasta, which was not fresh and tough to boot, and the rabbit was overcooked, with even the dark meat dry and hard.  

Listen, my son had a great time and that's what's important to me.  If I had been there with my fiancee, we'd have thought twice.

The morale of the story?  Never eat an expensive dinner on an amusement ride."}
{"text":"We came to celebrate my dad 75th birthday. The food and the service was extraordinary. He had the salmon and even made accommodations for his gluten free diet."}
{"text":"A trip to toronto isn't complete without a visit to the CN tower. It's more worth it to dine here than to just go up for the view. I made reservations on the day of my visit. It was pretty easy but probably because it was a weekday. They're not strict with the timing because we were 30 minutes late for our reservations and they still let us up. For the experience I would give it 4 stars, for the food I would give it 2, hence the 2 star review. Why? First of all, their service is really slow, my mom ordered coffee and it never came so she asked the servers about 3 - 4 times. Second, the food is really mediocre, but I guess people come for the 360 view right? Third, I ordered the fixe price meal and didn't want dessert but they refused to let me substitute it or even change the sides in my entree. I admit this place is kind of a tourist trap. They insist on ordering the fix price as a mandatory requirement to dine here but in actuality you could just order any entree. If I had known, I wouldn't have blown on my money on food I didn't want or like. A few tips, the restaurant may be moving slowly to circulate the whole city but after 2ish courses you should've gone through a whole circle. 

If you do plan on coming here, the dishes I recommend are the mango sorbet and lamb entree. The mussels appetizer tasted \" sea\" ish and there were barely any mussels, a lot of empty shells. You might think it's funny that I'm recommending the mango sorbet when I didn't want dessert in the first place. After the server said I wasn't allowed to replace any of it. He recommended the mango sorbet and I admit it was pretty good, it tasted like real mangos."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, both times for a birthday, and both times with reservations made for our party by my Step-Father (authoritative guy who doesn't mess around). We had a rather large party of around 12 the first time around, and we had to wait for our table - a busy Saturday evening. We arrived early as it was a surprise party and the other half of the party was to arrive 20 minutes later) but they ushered our half to the waiting area and had us at our table within 10 minutes) The birthday girl arrived and was pleasantly surprised to see the whole fam jam there, so the servers helped pull off a nice little surprise.

Our family adores seafood, so we always splurge for the for the 360 seafood platter and have been delighted every time by the freshness and selection of the seafood. The only note I'd have towards that, is that their chilled lobster is overcooked and slightly on the tougher side. The mains I've ordered here were the rib eye rare (fabulous, like meaty butter, melting right in your mouth) and the beef cheeks (also fabulous, absurdly tender, richly flakey and soo soo good). You have to order separate sides for most of the steaks, and yes, it's a money grab, but you are paying for quality, and that is what you get most of the time.

I did experience absurdly slow service during an early dinner reservation (5-7 pm) with the restaurant at mid capacity. BUT, the relaxed service seems to fade away as you admire the views of the city and chit chat with your dining compatriots while WASTED on expensive wine. I have never entirely minded the slow service, but I did notice it and have thought in my head (Um, I'm hungry, I wants ma meats, WHERE IS MY MEATS) and then 5 minutes later, it shows up. In the 360's defence, my Step pops is a big guy who ordered a huge steak and wanted it medium well done with a touch of pinkness and that's exactly what they brought out. Plus our server was a super cool accommodating dude and by the end of the service he was cracking jokes with our table and we were just having a rollicking good time."}
{"text":"For $55  lunch prefix menu and going up the grand cn tower, i had high expectation at this restaurant.
I came with a party of 3, and got sat on an overlooking table which was the best part of the dining experience.

Noticed everyone had bread basket, except us so i had to ask for one...it came together with our apps which didnt make any sense anymore....

I ordered the mussels and clams, said it had julienne vegetables, i didnt know it meant a sliver of red and yellow pepper, said it came with a saffron broth i dont know where that was my bowl was dry...it came out cold too. Disappointing. 
My friend got a seafood soup which looked good but again not even hot. How hard is it to pour hot soup on a bowl?
And my other friend ordered a shit salad on a plate, oh i meant caesar salad .... Which looked like sh t. Really 360? 

For entrees i had the lamb it was decent, my friend had the chicken she said it was ok, my other friend ordered a med well prime rib that came well done, had it changed and was done fast...
For dessert we had to wait for 20mins didnt know why took forever but fine..... Might as well look at the flying fish... Pass by our window....
Dessert came it was good. Lava cake didnt have a runny center though. On a smaller detail problem, Dirty plating. Smudges on the plate probably from a thumb that hit something.

Heard people complaint on the other table too which was interesting.

Anyway over priced robbery. U can spend ur money else where. Dont go"}
{"text":"Oh my. Sometimes you gotta just wonder how a restaurant can survive and still be in business when their only cooking instrument seems to be a microwave. Then, I remember that they have a monopoly on tall spinny restaurants for Toronto. Like any good economist would tell you, a monopoly usually is detrimental to the economy. 

I was traveling to Canada for work and we happened to be pretty close to the CN Tower so we thought it would be a nice way to see Toronto and eat some of the food they had to offer. 

Red Flags: Well they make you check with about four different stations to even access the elevator. They don't trust you to correctly use the elevator, so they hire three people to press the only button in it. There are giant photos of the food everywhere. They make you take a photo before entering the restaurant. 

First the food: For about $70 a person we were able to choose one app and one entree. For my entree I got the salmon. Salmon is probably one of the most forgiving foods to work with, but they managed to somehow ruin it. It seemed to be frozen salmon and was unseasoned. We also got the fries with truffle aioli. I think they took a play from McDonalds on this one and replicated the fries exactly. Also, they forgot the aioli, so that's cool. 

Service: Sometimes it nice to see your server in the first 5 mins of sitting down. Don't expect that here. And remember that photo you took at the beginning of your check in process. They will hardcore try to sell you that in the middle of your meal. Honestly they should get rid of this and invest in fresh salmon or training for their staff. 

Side Note: One funny morning thing happened on the elevator ride down. There was a new staff member being trained to push the down button on the elevator for us, and it was a completely foggy night, but she was reading directly from the script she had memorized, and the first thing she said was \"the view is amazing.\" That captures our experience pretty well, completely bamboozled."}
{"text":"i've trouble taking some of the complaints of bad value seriously. the portions at 360 are generous, the service is polished and no restaurant in toronto has more impressive views. not canoe. not stratus. not the one eighty. the value is actually pretty good. a trip up to the observation deck is normally $33. so, in a manner of speaking, the cost of the two course prix fixe dinner is more like $32. that's less than the cheapest steak at jacob and the cheapest main at canoe. 

the salmon i had last time i was at 360 was done well. it was properly seasoned and the ingredients were fresh. the beef tartar was also very flavorful. my dining companions had no complaints either. as you would expect, the dishes are competently cooked and designed to appeal to many. they aren't unconventional with crazy flavors. the wine list is quite good for a restaurant high in the sky.

if you were going to go up the cn tower anyway, 360 is a solid 5 stars. if you're just going for the restaurant itself, 4 stars. i'd have no trouble recommending this place to a tourist."}
{"text":"The view is nice, the food is extremely mediocre. Salmon was overcooked and fishy. The apps were awful. Came out 2 minutes after we ordered. Never a good sign. Two stars only because the place is so cool because of the view."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of this place. Yes you get the view but the food is really honestly not good. I'm easy to please when it comes to this but believe me don't bother here. Unless you want the view then come."}
{"text":"Woooow!  The CN Tower is fantastic as it is, but last night, I went to the 360 for the first time.  

First, you go through a series of checkpoints (the security area with the space-age metal detectors was my hubbys fave part of the whole night, lol), then up the elevator (not the cool glass one, though).  Once at the top, we proceeded to the maitre d' desk to be seated.  
The place was PACKED solid.  My hubby said it reminded him a lot of an airport, but I found it cute.  Seating is cramped and I had a lady constantly backing her chair into mine all evening. 

The Good:  STEAK!! MMmMMM I had the 360 caesar salad appetizer ($14), followed by the steak & lobster ($118).  The steak was fall-apart yummy-ness, full of flavour and cooked to perfection.  The lobster, however was over cooked, so a lot of it was hard and inedible...and there was mushy brown gunk, that I can only assume was spoiled meat mixed in with it.  Ick.  It came with delicious mash, bok choy and steamed asparagus.  Can we say STUFFED!!  Other than the lobster, which was a disappointment, my meal was fabulous and very filling.

Hubby had the seafood appetizer, which was some kind of white fish covered in vinegrette and lemon, Lobster meat and shrimp all squished into little tapas dishes.  Hubby had a hard time getting his fork into the dishes and said they should offer chopsticks, but he enjoyed it.
For his main, He had the 20oz steak with a side of grilled asparagus (sold seperate...the steak came alone..) and he ordered the tomato and swiss chard (sp?) side, as well, but after tasting it he decided although it tasted good, he felt it did not compliment his steak and sent it back.  

We split a bottle of 2008 Chardonnay White Zinfandel that tasted more like fruit juice then wine and we got pretty tipsy :D

The Not So Good:  Even with a reservation, we waited a good 15 minutes to be seated.  While waiting, I watched the maitre d' cough (more like hack) directly into his hands, then immediately touch menus, reservation tickets, etc.  Gross...

Kelly, our super-awesome waiter was exceptional!  He was attentive and friendly, constantly refilled my glass of wine (I blame him for my hangover today lol) and even took the tomato and swiss chard off our bill, since we barely touched it.  He was definitely worth his tip. ($75)

Bottom Line:  Beautiful scenery (as long as your seated next to the window and not on the higher level), small and cramped, yet cozy and romantic.  Our bill came out to $370 before tip, so this is a VERY-special-occassion-only type place, but I'm pretty sure we'll find a good occassion to be back.  Last night was our 4 year anniversary :D

Definitely have the steak!!"}
{"text":"Having gone to school in the city, worked in the city and lived in the city over a period of 10 years, I jumped at the chance to check out the CN tower's 360 restaurant, if only to say I'd been up the CN tower. We came on a Sunday evening to celebrate a few birthdays and Father's day. We were seated at a table right beside the window so we had a great view as the restaurant rotated. I didn't think you'd actually be able to see it rotating, but you could - very cool.

To start I got a peach Bellini and there wasn't much peachy about it. It tasted like straight champagne and was disappointing since I was looking forward to a peach flavored sparking beverage. For the $13 price tag, I'd say avoid. I got the Warm King Cole Duck Confit with Watercress salad as a starter, the Braised Rabbit with Gnocchi for dinner and Peach Crumble for dessert. When we ordered our appetizers, our waiter just sort of left afterwards and didn't ask if we were ready to order mains. So when he came back with our appetizers we all still had our menus and it was a bit awkward with the food and limited space. 

My appetizer was tasty but nothing like what I had expected. Shreds of duck on top of a delicate watercress salad. The flavors were all there and it was very tasty. However, for a salad, the majority of the dressing was in the centre of the dish buried underneath everything so it didn't start tasting really good until I was over halfway through it. 

There was quite a bit of a wait between finishing our appetizers and our meal arriving but with the view, I didn't notice too much until it had been a little while. Note that the kitchen is NOT on the revolving part of the restaurant; my understanding is that its at ground level, so that may have had something to do with it.

My main arrived and in the beginning it was quite tasty! Having never had rabbit before, it was flavorful but after eating the dark meat, I found the white meat to be unbearably dry, so much so that I left almost the entire chunk of it on my plate. The gnocchi were the standout in this dish, super tasty with the sauce at the bottom of the dish. I would have rather just had a plate of the gnocchi and a bit of rabbit, would have been a better dish. As noted, in the beginning it was good, by the end I was ready to see the white meat leave the table.

The peach crumble was a massive disappointment; canned peaches underneath a tasty crumble still can't save a dish that has CANNED peaches in it. Very unfortunate; would have rather seen a seasonal dessert that used the best fruit at the time, which would be Ontario berries, seeing as how its June.

The most abysmal part of the evening was the service. Since we were a group of 6, gratuity was included and our server knew it because he was awful. Not only was he basically dropping things onto the table in front of us (forks, menus, very careless), his GUT hit me in the back of the head while he was serving my boyfriend's appetizer. ICK. Didn't do much table service, couldn't have cared less if we weren't happy and was generally miserable the entire evening. 

While this was an unforgettable experience, at over $800 for six people, I felt that the food wasn't up to snuff, the service was horrid and even the view couldn't save my disappointment. If you're coming as a visitor to the city or a city native, make a point in coming up here for a drink and dessert and experience the view. Don't waste your time eating dinner here, your money is better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"You can't beat the view!

The food is OK and the prices on the high side, but you are paying for the view and the experience and it is well worth it!  Located on the first viewing level of the CN Tower, the restaurant is located against a wall of windows so everyone has a incredible view.  Dinner or Sunset to watch the lights come on is a great time to visit.  If you do not have a reservation, you will have a wait but it is definitely worth the time.  The service is friendly and good.  Check out the menu before you go.  A do not miss experience if you are going to the CN Tower.

TIP: If you have a reservation, you can skip lines at the bottom of the tower."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant with an amazing view....spin to see the city while you eat, what better way to enjoy good food! The best rack of lamb I have ever had and not to mention the amazing dessert sample! View + food = a definite win win!"}
{"text":"You would better think twice!!!

We, a group of six, had a dinner in such a well-known restaurant, which offers market-fresh cuisine and an incomparable culinary experience. During that period, all of us were not satisfied with overall service based on the following points:
-First, the waiter continuously asked each of us to order more, such as beverage, desserts and etc. 
-In addition, he was extremely impatient to answer our questions. A good case in point was that both my friend and I ordered the steaks medium done. However, my friend A advised him to check with the chef why her steak was significantly rare than mine. Unfortunately, he was eager to explain a lot in order to convince her that they were the same. Therefore, she was upset and emphasized that he was not in the position to offer appropriate answers and strongly suggested him to double check with the chef. Finally, the chef fried the steak again and provided more vegetables as well.  
-Besides, he brought the bill suddenly without prior notice which sent a strong signal that we would better to finish the dinner and leave the table immediately.  All of us got his point and then the cheerful atmosphere was disturbed. My friend B was disappointed and felt uncomfortable his behavior, getting more tips by increase turnover, and commented that the entire service was obviously below expectation.
-Moreover, thanks to my friend C, he spotted the tax was charged by 15% rather than 13% apart from the liquor tax (10%). When I challenged him, he argued repeatedly that he knew nothing about the tax and ran away to seek his line manager's help while we had not finished the conversation. Later, the line manager patiently listened to our concerns and explained that it was 15% due to hospitality. Meanwhile, I highly recommended her to provide the supporting documents from the authorities because 360 Restaurant is a restaurant not dining services from a hotel from our perspectives. Otherwise, the tax would be paid to obey the local laws and regulations. 
Regarding the 15% service fee was already included in the bill, on behalf of all of us, I informed of the manager that we would follow the practices of gratuity in the North America. On the contrary, no one could deny that the service we received tonight was totally unqualified and not worthy of the charge at all. It would be our courtesy to pay as long as the manager insisted on tipping. In the end, I was too furious to mention WE ARE STUDENT BUT WE ARE NOT STUPID.

After careful reviewing internally, the feedback from the manager was as follows:
-The service fee was waivered.
-The tax was charged by 13% rather than 15%."}
{"text":"A restaurant with an awesome view! I have to admit that the food was nothing amazing, it was almost like something you would get at cheap diner. I had a steak with mash potatoes and veggies. They were perfectly cooked, but nothing amazing, and it tasted a bit bland. I came here as a tourist for the view of the top of the CN Tower and I just happened to be hungry."}
{"text":"This is the place to dine if u r looking for an experience.  The free ride up the CN Tower, access to the observation deck, n the 360 view  are the FREEBIE one gets for paying high prices (higher than both Canoe n Aumerge de Pommier) for mediocre food. The service is the worst because most of the servers are the type of server that one gets when u r in a banquet - 'SERVE N RUN'. Theres no personal attention n no smile n NO SERVICE of any kind. At least one doesnt have to pay the banquet hall servers 15 to 20% gratuity.  Lastly, food is no different from any decent 2 or 3 star places.   2 stars for the restaurant n 1 more for the freebie 

Ordered:
Soup - east coast chowder
Main - Arctic char
Main - Lobster tail 
Dessert- Maple three kinds"}
{"text":"I am shocked. We went here a few years ago for dinner and had a wonderful meal with great service.

Went for a special occasion with the family  tonight and I really don't know where to begin the review.

1) Our server spoke so softly I could not understand him. Then he states he will be back in a few minutes to take the drink order and disappears off the face of the earth. His fellow employee's have to send out a search party to find him. This happens again with the main course order and dessert. Slow service would be an understatement.

2) The food. Three of us had prime rib as it was great the last time. Boy what a disappointment. Half my prime rib was pure fat and the other half needed a chain saw to get through the meat as was the same for my wife and mother in-law. My daughter had the chicken linguine and she said it was just okay.

3) The three of use barley ate any meat because it was so tough with little taste. When the waiter asked I told him that we did not enjoy our meals at all. He stated the manager would come and speak with us but never came to the table. (not good for business)

We ordered ice cream for dessert and the waiter said they would not charge for them. So basically feel like we spent $400 on an ice cream dinner with a view. I am not sure if they are under new management but  was very disappointed in the service, food and non caring manager.

Won't be back!"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant you kinda have to visit once. The experience was great as you simply can't beat the view!  As for the food, it was actually not bad at all."}
{"text":"food was decent. view was amazing. service good. Some of the dishes are as small as a quarter. THERE IS NO DRESS POLICY, just don't wear rags. There is a lot of confusion and basically we were told that they have some nice office clients who come in and they like to hear \"smart casual\" dress code."}
{"text":"This place is so 'top'. The dishes are great, not a vast variety of options to choose from but still there are suitable for all tastes.
They try to have your table as close as possible to the window, pretty nice from them because that's why almost everyone goes up there. 
The tables are in a moving circular platform (takes over an hour for an entire rotation) but the movement is smooth and comfortable
You have to order everything in the beginning and they serve it all quite fast but you can take your time to watch all the skyline  (anyway you'll be there for about an hour)
When you are finished you can still go to the observatory deck (lower) and the glass floor
The price might not seem cheap but it's only $15 more than the ticket to the observatory deck, so it is really worth visiting 
The views make this a 5"}
{"text":"Quite a memorable experience, since my husband and I went there for our first anniversary.  It coincided with thanksgiving, so the restaurant had quite a line up.  I stupidly made the reservation a day behind, and showed up assuming I had the reservation.  Luckily the host knew it was our anniversary, after a short wait, he gave us a table by the window.  We had the thanksgiving prix fixe, the food was amazing, the revolving view heavenly, and the service was top notch!  And a complimentary access to the Look Out and Glass Floor levels of the CN Tower after dinner is a great end to our evening out.  Next time I would like to go there just before sunset, I believe that would be quite magical as well."}
{"text":"The view from the dining area is spectacular and given that it is a bit of a tourist thing, I didn't expect great food. I was wrong. My meal was great and service was personal. I would recommend coming at sunset and dining at dusk."}
{"text":"This place was just ok to me! I don't really feel like the price was worth the food or the view. I ordered the prix fixe meal (3-course) for $79 dollars. I ordered the smoked ham hock, prime rib, and carrot/quinoa cake with a glass of red blend. The ham hock was different. It had really good flavor and the sweet relish that came with it was a nice accompaniment. My prime rib (which is $10 extra) was flavorful but overcooked. I asked for medium well and got well done. That's my fault for not just getting medium. I loved the potatoes and asparagus that came with it as well. The carrot cake with cinnamon extra was super yummy!

My server was very thoughtful. Once my neighbors were done eating, she offered to move me closer to the window for a better view! The meal came with comp access to the glass floor and observatory. With a glass of red blend my total was $114!"}
{"text":"So pleasantly surprised!  Expecting to find typical tourist trap food and service we couldn't have been more delighted.  Expensive, yes, but the food was excellent, well flavored and very carefully prepared. Service was attentive, professional, knowledgeable, pleasant and friendly.
The view is delightful, I'd recommend arriving 45 minutes to an hour before sunset, after dark you only see city lights."}
{"text":"I wish we had went during daylight so we had more visibility from the platform after dinner. Very nice romantic dinner with my wife. Great food and cocktails"}
{"text":"We came here on a whim as my roommate and I realized we had never actually been to CN tower, despite living two minutes away. 

It was quite the experience. 
I really think this is the best way to visit CN tower. 
With reservations beforehand, you get to skip the line downstairs. Your visit to the observation desk is complimentary if you order a prix fixe (normally it's $35 for the observation desk). 

The $70 spent on this meal was more than worth it. 
Even if the food was mediocre, I would still say I would have gladly paid it. 

This view by far is the best I have ever seen in any restaurant. In case you didn't know, the restaurant's floor revolves, so that in a span 2 hours you get to see a literal 360 view of Toronto. 

For the first ten minutes my friends and I just sat there and gawked at the view. It's that good. 

I highly recommend the Kozlik's Triple Crunch Mustard Braised Lamb Shank with green olive, Yukon potato mash and spiced Swiss chard. The lamb was very tender, and marinated so well. 
The Steamed East Coast Mussels and Clams with coconut curry broth, scallions and coriander 
was quite good as well. One taste of it and you can tell that the mussels and clams were still alive 20 minutes before serving. 

The music selection was absolutely atrocious though. I was expecting something jazzy or classical for this restaurant, but they were playing old pop music (or was it country even)? Either way, it was extremely unpleasant and kind of destroyed the otherwise perfect atmosphere for me.

Loved everything about this lunch. One of my favourite dining experiences this whole year for sure.

Oh, and by the way, this restaurant also probably claims titles for being the best restaurant to play I-spy at. Have a field day."}
{"text":"The view of Toronto and Lake Ontario has been breathtaking. As the name suggests, the restaurant rotates 360 degrees. It is very subtle. You don't even feel the revolving movements.   

I don't think the food was particularly good or bad but it wasn't really memorable; perhaps because I was captivated by the beautiful view of the city. Food may have improved as my review is not up to date. The server was attentive and friendly. You can even purchase a souvenir photo of your group dining inside the restaurant. 

Price-wise, if you want to go up to the Observation Deck, it may be about the same amount of money to spend on admission plus some food elsewhere versus having access to the Deck by eating at this restaurant; especially for lunch."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday (august 13th 2016). It was my 2 year anniversary and I was worried because of the few bad reviews regarding the food. But honestly everything was delicious! Me and my boyfriend  both had the steak and lobster and it was cooked perfectly! Wish they put more mashed potatoes on the plate because those were so yummy too and not enough. But I loved the whole experience! The view is incredible and our waitress was down to earth and very accommodating. We had the smoked salmon appetizer and the oysters as well and was all really fresh and good. I truly enjoyed my experience and will be returning next special occasion"}
{"text":"Let's just get it out of the way.  If you are here, you're here for the AMAZING views at the top of the CN Tower.  That's why I booked a table here.  You are (most likely) getting a front row seat to a rotating dining experience that lets you see the whole city while you dine.  

I was a little nervous about the food since I read reviews ahead of time, but everything that came to our table was delicious. Expensive yes.  I did the prix fix dining which for 2 courses was $56 CAD per person.  The reason I did that is because they said that the observation deck viewing was included with the price, but here's something - I don't think they would have cared / known that if I just bought an entree that I went to go see the observation deck.   Once we finished eating we were told to take the staircase down, see what we want, then come back up to take the elevator back down so that we skip all the lines.  

This is definitely an experience.   I was touring Toronto and it was a must see place so it was worth the cost."}
{"text":"The best time to come here is in the afternoon... NOT at night. From your table, you will see Toronto baked in yellow as the sun sets in the horizon. The view is beautiful. And because the restaurant is rotating, you'll get to see both west and east part of downtown Toronto. The view of the water, of the highways and Toronto streets are magnificent. 

The food is OK.... it's not the best but it's not bad. But I still highly recommend this place... it's an experience. You can get the best steak somewhere else but you will not get this view. 

This place is good for celebrations... birthdays, retirements or anniversaries. If you want to impress your date, bring him or her (whatever you prefer ;)) here. 

You can order wine by the glass but the good ones come in bottles only. They have fixed menu so you don't have to do a lot of thinking... gotta love those prix menu. 

So will I come back? Definitely!"}
{"text":"Should be more of a 3.5

The view is very nice and the restaurant has a nice atmosphere to it. The waiters are pretty nice and the staff is very helpful. The food on the other hand was definitely nothing close to a top restaurant in Toronto.

Ordered half dozen oysters which I definitely regret. They were terrible even for Toronto standards. I've had my fair share of oysters from San fran, San diego, Hong Kong etc etc. but even comparing to the oysters you can get in Toronto i definitely expected more.  

For my main I ordered the prime rib. It was alright. Filling and decent. Definitely not as good as Vegas but decent or a tourist attraction. 

Lady friend ordered the risotto and she enjoyed it. We skipped desserts as there was nothing really of interest on the menu.

Definitely go if you are visiting as it is worth going. I would book a table at 4:30 / 5:00 as the tables seem to fill up fast and the 4:30 slot will guarantee a window seat. If you don't need the view then I would most certainly pick canoe over this place."}
{"text":"The view was amazing! We paid for the view and experience. We went there on Valentine's day, they gave us a chocolate flower which was very sweet! We spent $182 (2 people)at lunch time, although their food was just average, it was worthy."}
{"text":"We were with a group from the Yankee Air Museum that had made dinner reservations for the 360 Restaurant with their three course prix fixe menu, or fixed price menu.  For a set price we got to select one choice from the items listed under Appetizer, Main Course, and Dessert.

We have previously eaten at other Tower restaurants and, for the most part, the food is just OK; the real attraction is the view while you eat.  That was my expectation for our dinner at CN Tower as we studied the choices.  My wife and I both chose the Albacore Tuna Crudo for an appetizer.  For the Main Course my wife chose a Taste of Fogo Island and I decided to try the 45-Day Aged Alberta Prime Rib.  Finally, for dessert, wife went for the Chocolate Tower; I wanted Banana and Toffee Verrine, but after I mentioned my peanut allergy, the waiter switched it to Mango Sherbet and Raspberry Sherbet.

After our drinks (Diet Coke) and a Bread Basket were delivered, our other choices came at a great pace for us to eat and enjoy conversation.  To our pleasant surprise, the food was very good; even my Prime Rib was done perfectly as I requested.  Throughout the meal, the service was excellent.  We were impressed with everything except for the Initial 20-30 minute delay to be seated.  Even the weather cooperated and visibility was great!"}
{"text":"My husband took me to Toronto for my birthday and made reservations for dinner at 360.  We have been to plenty of amazing restaurants around the world with impeccable food, service, and views.

VIew: Altough we booked late and the night view was nice, a daylight view would have been better. View comes at a premium as entrees include a $26 \"elevation fee.\"

Service: Notably worse than any other place in Toronto. The hot dog cart on the corner outside the tower boasted better customer service.  Most disturbing was when my husband asked for the manager (Arianna) to discuss with her our mutual discontent with our food (more to come) and she offered nothing but excuses for the condition of the food and staff. She was outwardly rude and the primary reason why we decided never to return - poor service from top to bottom.

Food: Sub-par...and that's being kind. Steak was not cooked as ordered and still undercooked.  Ceasar salad consists of four romaine leaves sitting on top of a few croutons and drizzled with dressing (which was the only positive experience). Hen was too gamey and delivered slightly warmer than room temperature.  When paying what this amount for dinner, even with a view, one should expect some delicious food to accompany!

Overall Experience: My husband and I decided to forgo our entire dinner, stomach the $52 elevation fee and get out of there as quick as possible! 

There are so many incredible places to eat in Toronto.  Do your research and save you time and money by skipping this place."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the prime rib and the seafood. The wine was great and the service was great as well."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went for our engagement lunch yesterday. The service was great and the views were amazing. We ordered a seafood platter to start and my fiancé had the stuffed chicken and I had prime rib. 

The prime rib, which I ordered medium rare came out closer to medium. It seems like it was heated in a microwave. 

My fiancé stuffed chicken seemed fresher and tasted delicious. 

For desert we had the ice cream and cookies (delicious) and the black Forrest (delicious). 

I was happy that the reservation included the observation deck and glass floor! Coat check and a photograph are also included upon arrival. You pay for the photo table side later on."}
{"text":"Separate elevator line to go up, no waiting at all! Great view too.

Got the rainbow trout entree with beets, it was pretty good. Chocolate moose tower was good too.

Considering that it is $23 dollars to go up anyways, it was a fairly cheap meal!"}
{"text":"Food is at best so-so at this restaurant, but what you are paying for is the view of Toronto at the comfort of your own setting while eating a 3-course meal that won't leave you hungry afterwards.  Lunch prix fixe is CAD55 while the entrance to the observation deck is ~CAD30.  The extra CAD25 definitely justified the meal.  The service was decent and we did not feel rushed.  The server took a very nice picture of us with the view behind us, which beats the fake picture they want you to take before entering the restaurant.  My fiancé ordered the steam mussels (huge portion but lack flavor), steak (overcooked, his medium rare order was more like medium well), and mango sorbet (very fruity and huge portion).  I got the seafood chowder (good mix of ingredients but the soup was lukewarm), pork chop (juicy and highly recommended), and pecan tart (another great choice)."}
{"text":"Overrated! Went here during my business trip to Toronto, and elevator ride to the restaurant was PACKED, even with our reservation... My colleague ordered a prime rib medium rare to rare and it turned out to be a different portion of steak. She complained numerous times that it was well-done and it wasn't prime rib and they kept on insisting it was.. After the manager came out back and forth, he in fact, later on admitted that they ran out of prime rib and it was in fact steak, well-done and that she would have to order a different meat and wait 20 minutes.... And then my manager ordered rib eye steak, medium rare, and it came out well-done... She had to wait 25 minutes for a new one to come out, and they claimed that the kitchen was closing soon, which didn't make sense cause we had a 9:00 p.m. reservation, it took them an hour to get our food out, and they messed it up! 

Definitely do not plan on going back and definitely do not recommend going here to eat. Overpriced and bad service!"}
{"text":"Review is for views and beverages only.

After our touristy trip up CN Tower we waited on a short line to get in to the revolving restaurant. 

We stepped to a tall bar table and ordered one latte and one espresso. Drinks were what we expected. Nothing bad to say.

The resto was revolving and we stayed 40 minuted, roughly, long enough to complete about a half rotation. 

It's worth the trip up, but not certain if food is worth ordering."}
{"text":"360 is an okay restaurant located in a unique place. You have to make a reservation before going, you pass through a security check up. You go into a separated elevator for the restaurant and afterwards you can actually go to lower floors; where the tour of the tower would actually begin. The waiter that I had, who was wearing glasses, was pretty inept, the food we had was okay, it wasn't as mind blowing. I've had better experiences in King West or the Distillery. The food is expensive, the drinks are expensive, the view is amazing. It is indeed one of the things you have to do once in your lifetime."}
{"text":"I don't even know what to say about this place. 

I would have NEVER in 1 million years, as a local, decided to go to the 360 Restaurant.

My brother was in town with his kids and they have never been up the CN Tower. He figured if we were all going up, we might as well dine there as you get free admission included. I knew the bill was going to be outrageous but he was paying so I bit my tongue and went along with it.

When you go here, you are really paying for the view and the uniqueness of the experience. NOT the food. But you're in a ROTATING restaurant, very high, downtown Toronto. So it's pretty cool. We did a 4:30pm seating which was perfect because we got to see the sunset and the city in both daytime and nighttime. 

The food = meh. They tout it as fine dining. The service was excellent and the food certainly came out LOOKING great, but none of the food was very good. I had a scallops w/ pulled pork entree that had crunchy/undercooked beans in it (kind of gross) and my \"RARE TUNA\" was not rare - it was cooked through - no red. WTF? If the name of the dish is rare tuna, serve it rare please.

Appetizers are mostly $18-$20, mains $35-$60 and desserts $12-$15. Not cheap. Kids meals $17. A prix fixe for $55 but only limited options, a better prix fixe for $68. The booze, for some reason, was actually reasonably priced compared to the food (You could get bottled beer and some wine for $6-7, and bar shots started at $6 too)

At those prices the food SHOULD be better. But I'm still giving it 3 stars because we were paying for the overall experience, which was pretty cool.

The service was absolutely excellent. Lots of kids here (obviously) but they do seem to seat the tables with children all on one side of the restaurant away from the parties with no children."}
{"text":"Breakfast was great!

The view, my oh my, the view! Watching planes take off near the water, and the buildings of downtown slowly curve by as the restaurant moves in a circle - there's just no other way to enjoy a coffee and strawberry pancakes. :-)"}
{"text":"During my first visit to Toronto, I wanted to do the touristy thing and visit the CN tower.  Instead of paying $32 to go up to the observation deck and the \"glass floor (i.e. a scratched up window that you can barely see anything underneath), they offered a deal to go up for free if you either order a prix fixe or one entree per person.  Seeing how the entrees ranged from $35-$50, it made the most sense to go up! 

I ordered a vegetarian dish -- crispy eggplant with paneer and soy protein.  It was amazing.  I'm usually a little harsh on poorly-fused Indian fusion, but this dish was a pretty good mix of flavors.  The crispy shallots also added to the unique flavor.  I was a huge fan!  

We also ordered the sweet potato fries and the asparagus with orange butter.  Both dishes were pretty good, albeit overpriced.  

The sangria was pretty good, too!  And not as expensive as the rest of the meal.

The dessert -- pineapple tartin was REALLY interesting.  Although I'm not normally a ginger fan, I really enjoyed the blending of the flavors of ginger and pineapple with the butternut squash/ginger ice cream.  It even came with a fluff of cotton candy!  

Overall, a great experience.  The service is great, ambience is great. Recommended to go when the restaurant first opens around 5pm, and to go on a clear, sunny day.  Takes about an hour for the restaurant to make a full circle.  Once you dine in this restaurant, visiting the observation decks below seems...blah.

I would recommend this for tourists! :)"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner date.

First, the atmosphere was amazing. I have always loved the CN Tower and travelling up it (especially with a lady on your arm) is always amazing. A beautiful view, nice lighting, and classy/comfortable environment. Just for this alone it is worth going there.

The food was great, pricey, but great. I can still taste the salad entree... yes the beginning salad... it was that good. I had a steak and it was medium well done, and the chef seasoned and cooked it well. Dessert was a chocolate cake which was dripping hot/cold awesomeness.

The only negative is the price for everything, but for those nights where you really need to have a spectacular night where price isn't a problem, I recommend."}
{"text":"The food, drinks, and view are top notch at this restaurant at the top of the CN tower.  I was on a company expense account when I came here so it was a no brainer to save the ~45$ tower admission fee by dining here.   You have to buy a minimum of the ~65$ two course meal to get the free admission.  I got the smoked ham hock appetizer and the Fogo Island seafood entree and they were both great.  The seafood dish was well prepared cod, shrimp, and crab.   The restaurant rotates so you can get a bunch of pics of Toronto.  There are even airplanes flying below the tower when they land at the airport nearby which is cool to see.

If you are dining on your own dime, one word of advice, the drinks, sides, and desert are generally not cheap and can add to your bill real quick and you may end up spending double the 65$ minimum.  Lol All great quality of course.  

After or before dinner, you have access to the two view point floors of the tower.  One you can walk on see through glass floors and look way down to the street below.  You can also see people who paid extra out on the open air girder with harnesses on leaning out over the street.  The other floor has a cage around it and you can see all of Toronto and the background lighting keeps changing colors at night."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service.  Waited 45 minutes to get our drinks, and then 1 min later our dinner arrived.  The food was very mediocre, at best.  Definitely NOT worth the extremely high price for this restaurant."}
{"text":"At $55 for prix fixe lunch, it seems pretty expensive. But, that price includes your ticket up the tower, so its not as bad as it seems. The views are amazing and well worth it. The food was good but not spectacular. I paid extra for the Prime Rib and was happy with it. 
Now on to the service. The server continually denied having wine that was on the menu. For someone who has worked there for 8 years, she should be very well versed with the selection of wines. She never left to check on it or anything, just denied it. I asked for a particular wine by the glass, she said they dont carry it. So I ordered a Late Harvest Riesling by the glass (its on the menu)... Then she brought me a regular riesling. When i mentioned tht it was not a late harvest riesling, she exclaimed,\"I told you we were out of it!\" You told me? No, you certainly did not. And why would you even say that? I also ordered a side of asparagus... The server could have told me that Asparagus COMES with my meal... Just arrogant and lacking in humility. At least I only had to deal with her in small spurts throughout the lunch."}
{"text":"We were skeptical that a restaurant this touristy would be good, but it was! I mean, it better be for what you're paying, right? But at least we got to go up in the tower for free for paying for the $52 prix fixe. Expensive, yes, but the deal makes it more worth it. Plus, you're also paying for the spectacular view. The restaurant rotates much like The Sun Dial in Atlanta. Very cool.

My appetizer was a combination of proscuitto, olives, cheese and these long sticks that I dipped into some kind of dip. It was tasty! For the main course, I got the trout and my dessert was some kind of truffle cake. All yum-tastic. I also got some cheap.....well the cheapest they had....wine at $9/glass. 

Recommended, for sure. The service was ok, too, if not a bit stuffy. ;)"}
{"text":"Just getting to the restaurant was not a fun experience. The CN Tower is sorely lacking signs (and sometimes staff) to direct you on where to go. The lines/procedures for visiting the top of the tower vs going to the restaurant are different, so my boyfriend and I found ourselves going back and forth a lot and lining up unnecessarily with the crowds just going to the top. By the time we arrived at the restaurant, we were peeved and slightly late - but even then our table wasn't ready yet. The staff who set the tables and served water were friendly... to my boyfriend only. I felt completely ignored - I'm not just trying to complain, but it was a very discouraging experience. The waiter we had was very friendly and helpful, on the other hand, which was refreshing after such awkward and annoying experiences prior. The views are amazing. The restaurant rotates if the weather is cooperating, and you get great views of the lake and the city. The food was okay - very well presented and nice-looking, but the taste was nothing exceptional. Overall, I think a lot of the slightly more negative aspects of this experience could have been easily remedied. The views are nice, but I'd rather recommend someone to go to the top and eat at the cafe rather than going to the 360 restaurant. The only other plus of going is probably the ride to the top since it's included with the set meal price."}
{"text":"Visited on July 28th with my wife for Celebrating our engagement anniversary. Great place at great location but very noisy and not a classy dinner place. You spend hell lot of money but not get quite ambiance looking for. Food was good."}
{"text":"By myself in Toronto for business. Decided to look on open table and made a reservation for one :) Got a beautiful seat near the window. The restaurant rotates so you can see the whole panoramic view! A full rotation is 72 min. And what a view it is. The water front is beautiful. You can spot tiny canoes & sail boats in the distance. See planes land on the island. On the city side, beautiful buildings, trains, tons of tiny people. I thought 1 rotation was going to feel long. I did two easy! 

The recommended white wine I chose was the Canadian Riesling! Oh my, that's a stellar glass of wine. I savored it through the entire meal! 

Lamb sausage starter was nice. I did miss the minty flavor that goes so well with it. The mint peas did not bring it forward.

Entree was osso bucco with foie gras. The foie gras was super tasty. The osso bucco dish lacked finesse in presentation. The accompanying corn was a tad too salty.

Since none of the desserts really jumped out at me. I decided to go with a cheese to finish this beautiful meal. Oh my goodness it was divine. Plenty of accessories like grapes, honey comb, pears, raisin bread. Nom nom nom! 

I will return! Next time I'm bringing a date though :)"}
{"text":"Having read mixed reviews, I was not too sure about what to expect here other than the view. However, I was glad to be mistaken as this restaurant is one hell of an experience! Being vegetarian, I was rewarded with good food options and the wine was good too. The elevator ride is amazing (try getting in last though)! However, there were some questionable moments as well! The portions run large and we ended up with left overs. The servers boxed it for us and when we requested for a bag, we were given a flimsy plastic bag from their local grocery purchase! After the classy experience, to get a smelly bag was an unexpected gesture. Also, as mentioned in an earlier review, everyone is asked to pose for a photograph at the reception, a lady came up while we were eating to sell us the picture trying to hard-sell the picture. While I do appreciate the marketing effort, it certainly wasnt welcome while trying to create a special dining experience. After having purchased the picture, I later realized  that the picture was damaged as well! Well, the views and the food still made up for the experience and I would certainly go back!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre food but stunning bird's eye view of the city.  The pasta was bland, but you hardly noticed as the sun set and every turn brought a different view of the blushing sky."}
{"text":"I came to Toronto this summer on a family vacation. I was online, exploring places that were a must visit, while in this beautiful city and the CN Tower always came up very high on the list of places to see. It said that in order to really get the full experience, that we should have dinner here, so we did.

Let me first say, that the building is beautiful from the outside, it is about 1,815 feet tall, and the top of the building is pointed. Once you go inside, you are directed to the elevator. The elevator is glass and you can see a big portion of Toronto from here. It is absolutely breathtaking.

Once you reach the top, you are directed to the restaurant, where they give you a number and it will vibrate once your table is ready.

We were seated on a floor table, which is what we wanted, so that we could feel the restaurant rotating. This was a gorgeous view, as we got to see the whole city from such a high viewpoint. There is even a little fish at the window and every seven minutes, when you see it come around, it indicates a full rotation.

Our waiter was very nice and friendly. He was quick in bringing out our food, but did not rush us in the slightest.

We ordered two bottles of the pinot grigio and it was delicious. The food was also very good. This is a pricey restaurant, but if you are in the country, I would definitely recommend it, because there is really no place quite like it.

My only complaint would be the dessert. I ordered the chocolate mousse, and while very pleasing to the eye, I really did not find it to be that tasty. It was far too sweet and there was really no balance of flavor. It was supposed to be cakey but it was really just mousse with a chocolate shell overlay. It was not bad, but not as good as I was expecting for the price.

Besides that, it is a beautiful view, the restaurant has great tasting food, and the service was fantastic overall."}
{"text":"You can't ask for a better view. I was surprised at how good the food was for being such a touristy place. My friend and I went for brunch and it was a perfect way to see the city, enjoy good food and get to see a touristy place for a good price. It's a great deal to eat here."}
{"text":"Me and a friend travelled to Toronto in October and obviously the CN tower was on our list of sights to take in. However when we saw the price tag for simply going up ($30 odd dollars at the time) we thought we might pass. Then we saw that the 360 restaurant was offering the same plus a 3 course meal for $55. We thought this was a great deal and booked ourselves in for lunch. We both agreed it was a great decision and a great meal that we couldn't fault. The staff were lovely, the restaurant classic and uncluttered and the food very good. A particular highlight was a Lindt chocolate tart that you should definitely get if you go. Of course, a big plus was the views, the revolving design means you take in the entire city scape whilst you dine: a wonderful experience. I would highly recommend this to any visitors as we were staying in a nearby hostel (the Planet Traveller, a great place to stay!) and this was our luxury treat of the holiday for what is a very reasonable price. Afterwards we took in the observation deck and left very happy and full!"}
{"text":"Dining at the CN Tower was exactly what I thought it was going to be. It's touristy, the food isn't going to blow you away, but honestly you go there to enjoy the view while you dine and not for the food. I did like how they setup the prix fix menu which made selecting our dinner easier. At first glance you might think eating at the 360 restaurant is expensive but it's worth it when you remember that you're eating in the sky. A nice added bonus is access to the observatory deck when you dine at 360. I'd recommend everyone dine here at least once especially if you're a tourist."}
{"text":"View is amazing. It supposedly spins 360 degrees within the course of an hour.

With that said, the food was decent. Not worth the price at all, but being edible, I suppose, is enough when it's technically only $40 a meal, as an admission to the top of the tower is obviously included. Don't expect much from the food. My table had the Atlantic salmon & scallop plate, grain-fed chicken, and the best one, by far, was the pork tenderloin."}
{"text":"I am a professional Toronto-based lifestyle photographer for an online magazine. This is not someone with a previous gripe or a novice foodie.

Went to the restaurant on Mon Feb 15, 2016 at 6:30pm. Group of 5. Entertaining out of town guests from Japan.

The View - cloud, we could not see anything. Maybe they should start offering a voucher or discount when there is no view.

Negative memorable experience #1 - waiter was awkward and didn't know when to leave. A few times he stood around with his hand on an empty chair at the table and just stood there or continued to chat with me. Also, he mentioned eating dogs and cats. Seriously? This man needs etiquette classes.

Negative memorable experience #2 - the manager doubles as a sommelier, go figure. When I asked for a sommelier, the manager showed up but could not give me any information about ice wine that wasn't on the menu. Also they gave us a bottle of a different year until I asked the waiter why?!

Negative memorable experience  #3 - chipped beer glass. I can only say, SERIOUSLY?! A health hazard which can cut lips. We're not talking about a slight chip, it was about a 1 cm knock. The glass was sent back. The manager was informed. They gave us a new beer, new glass and complimentary dessert - the reason why, I gave them an extra star. At least they did this.

Overall, it's not fine dining. Customer service was trivial. Food was good enough. The cost... well, there's no value to coming here other than the view.
$725 without tip for 5 people:
  $100 x 5 for lobster and steak
  $150 x 1 for ice wine ($60 at LCBO, high margin)
  $75 x 5 for beer and coffee
 
And my overseas guests were not amused. Frankly I'm embarrassed to have given them such an experience. Would I go back? no, unless it's for coffee and a snack and it's at the urging of out of town guest. Unfortunately the restaurant has a monopoly on the view and this won't change.

360 Restaurant, I would love to hear from you and what you have to say.

Moreover, for the management:
You might want to look at quality control procedures.
You might want to train your staff in etiquette and social norms of different nationalities. Japanese people tend not to make a fuss to avoid an embarrassing situation. They also don't want to hear about eating dogs and cats either."}
{"text":"Because our first meal in Toronto left a lot to be desired, we decided to go the tourist route and have a late lunch at 360 Restaurant which is in the CN Tower.

We originally wanted to just go up for an aperitif but we soon learned that there was an entry fee so we opted to just go ahead and make a reservation in order to avoid the cover charge.  Three hundred dollars ($300) later, we left hungry with a stomach ache but at least we got to see a panoramic view of Toronto and ride an awesome elevator!

Here is what we ate:


360 Caesar Salad
The Caesar dressing made my stomach hurt.  I couldn't eat more than one bite of this!  It tasted like someone used maple syrup to sweeten the dressing!

Red Corn Flour Crusted Calamari
Dr. J and I had mixed reviews on this.  I thought it was okay--a bit soggy--but she was not a fan.  The pistachio pesto was a hit for me.  It would have been perfect if it was served a bit warmer--maybe it was the high altitude?

Foraged Wild Mushroom Tart 
We are not sure if this was meant to be served cold but it wasn't warm at all.  Must be that altitude thing again.  The \"Pingue\" Prosciutto was edible though.

Stacked Heirloom Tomato Salad with Water Buffalo Mozzarella 
 Seriously this one is pretty hard to mess up.  Lucky for us the temperature of the food did not play a factor.

Ontario Lamb
Grilled Ontario Lamb Rack Chops.   Nothing to really get too excited about.  Oh wait, it had rosemary jus! 

Slow Roasted Canadian AAA Prime Rib
This was just a big N-O!  The rosemary bread pudding was a little dry.

Summer Harvest Vegetables
They had rosemary butter but still could have used some Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning.

At the end of the day, at least we can say that we have been to CN Tower and actually went inside.  The elevator was the most memorable--and expensive--part of the meal.  At this point Toronto is 0/2 for good food!"}
{"text":"So this is definitely one of those touristy spots that I would never eat at if I lived there, but since I was visiting it was OK. It was a journey to the top and I'm not just talking about the elevator ride, the 4 checkpoints plus the waiting in line made it about 20 minutes or so when we got to the tower before we were seated. But hey, that comes with the atmosphere. Great food and an amazing view, plus you have access to the sky deck when you are finished eating. Our waiter was not very hospitable, but overall this was a fun and tasty experience."}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend for dinner on a Friday night. Since she'd never been to CN Tower, we waited a bit for a window seat, which was definitely worth it. While you can see the view from any seat, a few diners who were seated away from the window were craning their necks to get a better look.

We had the 3-course prix fixe and wine. I had the chowder appetizer and the steak entree, ending with some kind of orange candy almond tart dessert. The appetizer was nice and light, but it was the steak that I was really happy with. Juicy and tender. My girlfriend also enjoyed her meal. However, both my girlfriend's sherbet dessert and my tart dessert were a little too sweet.

As with everyone else, the view was what we took from the experience. Getting to sit by the window for a 3-course meal while enjoying a 360 view of the CN Tower? Hard to beat.
The process of going up to the 360 restaurant and back down was quick and painless.
Our server was very polite and courteous, as were the other servers around us. The view was the highlight, but service and food kept the experience positive from start to finish."}
{"text":"This place really  surprised me!!.. In a very positive way!... Normally restaurants in touristic places are not good, Or just ok, but this restaurant is very very good!! There is nothing I can complaint. The view is the most beautiful view of Toronto!!.. It is really nice to have lunch or  dinner looking the whole city from that perspective!!.. In addition, the service was very good. Everything since the beginning was incredible Delicious!!.. And the portions were very big... Which is not very common for this kind of restaurants.  I had the seafood salad, and everything was really fresh and the dish was huge!!.. I couldn't finish it. The pork was delicious too... And the desserts were great!!.. And the prices in my opinion are inexpensive considering The place is very touristic and the big dishes... I definitely recommend this place 100%

Tip: make reservations, so you don't have to pay for going up in the tower."}
{"text":"Our Anniversary and Celebrated my wife 'a birthday Excellent food!! Fresh and exquisite meal. Excellent service, all their suggestions were 4stars!!"}
{"text":"As has already been said, the view was phenomenal, and it was great to skip the lines and not have to pay for the observation deck. The prices were high (we went for lunch) but they always are at this kind of place, so we expected that.

I was pretty impressed with the food, I had the salmon and spinach quiche with sweet potato fries and it was tasty and filled me up. The others in my party were happy with their food as well.  We weren't rushed, and the waitstaff was accomodating. It was also easy to make a reservation online beforehand.

My only complaint is that when I made the online reservation it asked if there was a special event, and even though I indicated there was a birthday, the server didn't mention it or do anything to recognize the event. That's fine - but don't ask if you're not going to act on it. ;)"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! Food was delicious and it's safe to say that was the best food I have ever had my entire life! The view is breath taking!"}
{"text":"The view from this rotating restaurant on top of CN tower is the best of Toronto and amazing at sunset. I overall enjoyed my dinner experience and spent a good 2-3 hours total at CN tower. 

We made dinner reservations day of on a weekday and timed it so we were able to see the view during day, sunset, and night. They have a coat check and then you go up to the elevator. The restaurant is actually the highest level. My friend and I ordered pre-fixes menu ($60 or $75), which is actually a good deal if you considered that it costs $30 to go to the top anyways. 

Appetizer: Salmon and Potato tart - a nice start to the meal, not too fishy and the tart wasn't too hard. 
Entree: Pork tenderloin stuffed with hazelnut and spinach. Canadians love their pork. This one wasn't too dry for the amount of nuts on the dish, and the flavors worked out. 
Dessert: Dark chocolate tower. I really liked the presentation and the fruits and chocolate paired well with each other. 

In addition to the meal, you get access to both levels (which would've cost $30-40ish) and see the glass floor. For decent food and a good view, I recommend reserving dinner here!"}
{"text":"What can I say? It's a restaurant towering over the beautiful city of Toronto. We went in with lowered expectations as the reviews for the food were lackluster, so we were pleasantly surprised when we had a great meal there! The service was phenomenal, we were given a window seat (not sure if my request on the online reservation was what achieved that or just pure luck), and were seated right away, even though we arrived 15-20 minutes early. 

You sure are paying for the view here, a single beer will cost you $13, and a non-alcoholic specialty drink $9. I opted for water, not only because I'm a cheapskate but also because I'm not sure my stomach could handle it, as it was already a little queasy looking down on the city below!

You can order an appetizer and an entree or an entree and a dessert as part of a 2 course prix fixe. We ordered a Caesar salad to share, and it was delish! The dressing is a garlic-lover's dream. I ordered the Chicken Quebec, which was delightfully crispy and perfectly juicy. My husband ordered the rib-eye, which is where we lose a star in this review. He ordered medium rare, and this thing was bloody. Not even seared on the outside. Not sure what happened there. For a $10 supplement, he was looking forward to a well-cooked steak.

Overall it was a great experience for a special occasion. Definitely something you need to see once in your lifetime!"}
{"text":"Went here for my wife's birthday. We had a really great time. We went on a Monday night and we were able to avoid any traffic issue (highway was smooth sailing, parking was easy and the restaurant wasn't overcrowded). Since we had dinner there, we also checked out the tower itself which was amazing. The food wasn't anything amazing but we wouldn't say it was bad either. It is a bit pricey for the food, but with the view and experience, the price can be justified. Would recommend to go on a week day so you don't feel crowded in the space. 

We ordered one pre fixed menu and one a la carts and French fries with truffle aioli. Note: They do change their menus I believe every 3-6 months."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant but unfortunately I was quite let down. As we got to the restaurant we were initially thrilled as there were a LOT of people trying to get up the CN Tower on a Saturday evening. Having a restaurant reservation, you're able to bypass the massive lines of people and go straight up to the restaurant deck which was excellent. When we got into the restaurant the hostess was extremely surly, you could tell she didn't want to be there. She instructed a waiter to take us to our table. As we walked down the stairs we were super excited to be getting a seat by the window - looks like we were wrong about that! We got seated at a table by the inside wall where the walkway was a little bigger and could accommodate 2 tables - one by the window, one in the weird hallway. Having booked 5 weeks in advance, I was NOT happy to be seated in a weird hallway with an obstructed view. The restaurant was also very loud - I feel like they are trying to be a classy, upscale type restaurant with their menu and pricing, but it just felt tacky and touristy. 

The food was very average, as was our server. At one point the couple next to us left and we asked the waiter if we could move tables. He went on to say that it's up to the hostess who gets seated where, and the seating arrangement is dependent on who booked first, and that we must have booked later than everyone else seated by the windows. Somehow I call bullshit on that one. We left having paid $200 for a very average meal and basically no view because of everyone sitting in front of us. Definitely not the experience you want at a restaurant that a) I booked 5 weeks in advance and b) where the only reason you dine there is to have a great view. They should either get rid of that shitty table altogether or put walk-in reservations there to avoid disappointment."}
{"text":"We walked in late night without a reservation but was still able to dine. I hate that all the appetizers that have meat were raw. So i opted for the mushroom soup which was delicious. The entrees were chicken with brioche pudding ( tasted like thanksgiving stuffing) and spinach, while my bf had the salmon. Food is good but really worth it because of the view.  The chocolate tower is a mousse dessert ( little pieces of cake inside ), worth splitting it with your partner."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch. I dressed a little too causal (buttonup and jeans), its an upscale venue. The view was remarkable. Add it to your bucket list. Reservations are a must. Indescribable dining experience."}
{"text":"Amazing view of Toronto. Took my S.O. there on her first time on Toronto. She loved the place. Absolutely stunning view of Toronto during a bright sunny morning.

The food is pretty good. I ordered the mushroom soup and steak. My girlfriend ordered the bison which was the best thing on the menu, totally worth the $95!

Compared to Los Angeles prices, the restaurant isn't that expensive if you account for the view and that you get to cut in line to go up the tower. Totally worth it for us."}
{"text":"I opted to dine here rather than pay $35 to go up the CN tower because the prix fixe lunch is only $55 a person. I must say, the experience was great! You go up a glass escalator after being checked by security. Afterwards, you are given a ticket and led to the restaurant. Since I made reservations online, we didn't have to wait at all and were seated immediately  by a window seat that I had requested. There was a couple ahead of us, who did not make reservations and were told that they had to wait 45 minutes if they wanted a window seat. So make reservations if you plan on coming! 
Anyway, the view was breathtaking! It was great experience as neither of us has ever been in a spinning restaurant. We were told that it takes an hour before the restaurant makes one full rotation. Our meal lasted for about an hour and half, so we were able to see everything at least once. 
The food, however wasn't great. I wouldn't say it was bad, but it was mediocre. We had the lamb and steak, which was okay. The only dish worth mentioning is the cranberry pecan tart, which was delicious! 
Come for the experience and view, but don't expect much for the food. Having dined here already, I probably would not come back again."}
{"text":"The view is amazing. It was a very foggy day and I felt like we were dining upon the clouds. The ambiance is very cozy. Though the food is very overpriced but worth going. We ordered the slowly cooked beef ribs (46 cad) and the lamb rib (55 cad), half dozen oysters (18 cad) , Gin w tonic ( 8 cad), after dinner wine.
Very expensive but the view is breathtaking."}
{"text":"This is a must do experience! One of the coolest dining experiences I have ever had. First of all, you get to cut long annoying lines and go through a highly organized route to take an elevator reserved for the restaurant. Then, you walk into the restaurant and you awe struck by the beauty of the view. It is absolutely breathtaking! I would highly recommend doing the price fix menu and subbing for a main and dessert instead of an appetizer. We got the salmon and the pumpkin ravioli and shared and they were both delicious! Then we got the molten lava cake and Black Forest cake for dessert and that was my absolute favorite part of the meal! The molten lava was rich and heavenly! They also have a decent wine selection. I got a great glass of Merlot. And lastly, we had a French waiter who was the nicest guy! All the waiters there were so nice and accommodating. Amazing experience all around!"}
{"text":"I loved it! You can see every inch of Toronto while having your meal. The food was beyond delishhhhhhhhhhh!!! My boyfriend and I went to celebrate both of our birthdays (which is 8 days apart) and they brung us ice cream with happy birthday on it. Even that was delish! Omg I will be back time and time again! Definitely recommend this place to everyone who visits Toronto. Oh did I mention it revolves! Lol :)"}
{"text":"Just from a restaurant perspective, this place worth 2 star rating at the most. It is purely a tourist place. I have been here couple of times with friends visiting Toronto. The food on the menu was just OK and very overpriced. For example, the 75-dollar steak is no way close to any of the well-known steakhouses in Toronto. It takes a LONG time to get the food too. Service was just so-so. The last time we were here, we sat there for half an hour without any staff asking until we asked for service twice. Generally not recommend unless for first time visitors."}
{"text":"An awesome experience if you are visiting Toronto, and I fully recommend!

We didn't make any reservations until we arrived to Toronto for our trip. So on Saturday we made reservations for that Sunday night, where the only available time was 10 pm. To the normal person that may seem silly but bf and I are late eaters, and wanted to give some time for all the other goodies we had throughout the day to digest.

So we arrived at 9:45 and got the complimentary elevator ride up. They take pictures for you in front of the green screen but are supposed to offer it to you during dinner, but somehow they skipped us....boo. So we never saw that picture.

We were originally sat a couple rows away from the window. After people started flowing out (it's past 10 pm already) we got to move over to the window seats. Yay! That made the view worth it so you don't have to look through everyone's heads. 

Food was pretty good - two 2-course meals, so we had the tuna, salmon ($6 add-on), and two entrees of prime rib ($10 add on). The prime rib was made perfectly! Medium rare and a bunch of pink on the inside, while the outside was seared and crisp. I liked the tuna better (topped with avocado) while the bf liked the smoked salmon better. Salmon came with some kind of bread that was flavorful and delicious, as well as some kind of sweet pickled onions. I kinda wanted something with a bit more *pop* to top it off, maybe capers.

So all in all it was a very excellent dinner, and I think you should try if you are a first time visitor!"}
{"text":"Make sure you get reservations at this restaurant of towering proportions!  You can get a complimentary elevator ride if each adult buys a main entrée (ranges from $35-90).  The fish and chips may sound ordinary, but it is not the American fish and chips.  They served swordfish over a sai-fun (rice noodle) and lemon grass, cherry tomatoes sprinkled on top of the entrée.  Fresh mussels were arranged on the outside of the entrée, and they were delicious.  The French fries were served on the side.  
Their Caesar salad was really good!  What makes the difference was the dressing, which contained ingredients like Tabasco sauce and red wine vinegar.  This Caesar dressing made the salad a standout.  The salmon was served with asparagus and a fried shrimp cake on the bottom, and it was exceptional.
This is easily the priciest meal in town, but the best.  Not only you get a great dinner, but you get a great view of the city, 1,400 feet up (which is a level higher than the observation deck!)."}
{"text":"We were here two weeks ago on a Sunday for lunch. The food was great, best view for sure. The food price of course balanced out with tickets administration if you purchased that separately. For a group of 5, including 2 kids, we spent $300 including tax and tips."}
{"text":"I guess the best way to describe the 360 restaurant is more as an experience than a good place to dine. My boyfriend and I went for the prix fixe menu. If you are a steak lover you will not enjoy the steak that they offer on the fixed price menu it is chewy, bland and not the best cut. The beet salad appetizer was pretty good. Bread was brought out cold but warmed up after requested. The food is filled with butter so if you dont like butter make sure you ask for no butter at all because even the veggies are soaked in it. The server was okay and handled our issues with the food properly. In regards to the restaurant itself, the view was amazing of course and I must say that was the take away from the evening which is why this is a good place to go for the experience. My recommendation is to order simple items on the menu to avoid disappointment."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Dallas and very excited when my friend told me she made reservations at this known restaurant. CN tower is beautiful and I was looking forward to the amazing view and experience from the top of the tower. Unfortunately, it ended up being quite disappointing.

When we arrived, we were seated at a table that had an impeccable view of downtown Toronto. That was as pleasant as the experience went. This restaurant is quite pricey so I was expecting outstanding service and a flavor filled meal. Our server Don seemed very uninterested and made me feel rushed to order. Our reservation was at 9:15pm and we arrived right before 9:30pm. I understand that they were closing soon but for someone who's never been there, I expected Don to be a little more enticing and helpful. It would have been helpful if he explained that the minimum requirement is an appetizer or dessert and an entree. Finding that out 10 minutes after looking at the menu was time wasted.

For my appetizer I ordered the heirloom tomato salad which tasted pretty good. Presentation was beautiful, which is what I expected. I went with the pan seared atlantic salmon for my entree and that was just okay for me. Nothing spectacular. 

I definitely wouldn't recommend this restaurant nor will I ever consider returning. It all starts with service and that can make or ruin an entire experience. It ruined it in my case."}
{"text":"Really nice, wonderful, splendiferous View!
But that's all I had a chance to \"really\" enjoy, since the prices were incredibly high! The coffee was good, and so was their Ice cream, which costed around $20 :/"}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants you HAVE to visit at least once in your life, if you're from Toronto. Located atop the CN tower, the rotating restaurant provides a view of the entire skyline of Toronto. Tickets to the CN tower are already 40 per person, so a 2 course meal for 65$ per person with complementary access to the observation deck is definitely worth it instead. Here's the takeaway: visit this restaurant instead of buying a 40$ ticket. 

Recommended order (3 course):
- Atlantic smoked salmon 
- Duck Breast
- Chocolate Tower

My girlfriend and I each ordered from the 3 course Prix Fixe menu. I ordered the smoked Atlantic salmon as my appetizer, and it was a treat. 4 pieces of tender, fresh salmon served with an amazing sauce, and cheese to boot. My girlfriend ordered the Chowder, which was average.

Next, my entree was the Alberta prime rib of beef, which was MUCH larger than I had expected. The skin and the stripe of fat was great with the medium rare meat, but there was too much fat in the center. You should ask for pepper on the rib. The duck breast that my girlfriend ordered was absolutely delicious, incredibly juicy, and pairs amazingly with the sauce.

Finally, all their deserts are amazing. I got the strawberry pavlova, which had an amazing jam sauce. The chocolate tower stood out as well.

The staff was extremely nice, service was fabulous. The waiter was very tolerant of our incessant picture taking, and even offered to help. He also took care of needs like replacing dropped cutlery and bread. Absolutely amazing service.

I highly recommend this experience for anyone who wants to visit the CN tower, but not for only the restaurant. The price is greatly justified by the trip to the top of Toronto, not by the food."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience. Sometimes tourist places rest on their location and view and care less about the food - not here! I went early [before the sun was low enough to blind me!] and it was excellent. I selected from the prix fixe menu and could not finish dessert. The Moz and Tom salad was heaven and the salmon was great. The berry and chocolate dessert was way more than I expected and I am still working on it in my hotel room. Service was nice. 
I have no idea why people bring kids to a place like this but was sitting far enough away from the screaming baby to ignore it. 
The place rotates quickly enough to see everything but not so fast that you get woozy. 
The elevator is a bit woozy-inducing and I am not nervous about heights. If you are, close your eyes!"}
{"text":"It's a heck of a view from the 360 restaurant. While I don't think it is the highest restaurant in the world anymore (that's in Dubai), it's certainly the tallest view of this city. The entire outer edge of the restaurant completes a full revolution in a brisk 72 minutes (and why people are determined to test this is beyond me). This gives you a wide vista of the lake, Toronto Island, and the downtown core.

As a non-tourist to Toronto -- and therefore not effervescently soaking in every wonderous facet of the tower -- I found getting here a little annoying. There is a green-screen photobooth on ground level (which we sprinted past) and then a wait at the elevators, and then yet another wait to get into the restaurant; odd considering it's reservations only. It was a relief once we were seated. 

The 360 has the atmosphere of an upscale chain steakhouse. Note that there are some tables NOT situated directly next to windows, and I would feel hosed were I seated there. (Mostly two-tops.) Probably worth clarifying this specifically when making a reservation.

Much has been said about the high-prices here, so I will only chime to agree that yes, the menu is pretty overpriced for what you get. You'll probably end up ordering either the $55 or $68 prix fixe meals, as scanning a la carte pricing might give you vertigo (shrimp and grits: $50?). I opted for the bigger prix fixe.

We started off well. The charcuterie board was served with Kozlik's mustard and had some nice Quebec cheeses. And there was a dill gazpacho served in a shot glass as an amuse bouche. Ooh la la. My entrée (which took a while) was a prime rib with bread pudding. The prime rib was cooked OK, but it wasn't stellar. I can't put my finger on it, but it just wasn't melt-in-your-mouth succulent. The bread pudding is easier to assess: burnt and bitter. It was truly terrible, and I wish I hadn't even taken a bite.

My goat's milk vanilla ice cream for dessert was topped with dulce de leche and caramelized bananas. Not a bad way to end off a meal. By the time we left, the sun had set and downtown had transformed into twinkling lights against the darkness. (Our 7:30pm reservation let us catch the skyline in daylight, and let us enjoy the sunset too.) The atmosphere is definitely enjoyable, but food-wise you're likely to be disappointed.

Obligatory Title Pun: Unsuited for TOWERING expectations.

Menu Readability: Well-designed to make you order the prix-fixe.

Need to mention: No patio. Unless you want to die.

What this place teaches me about myself: My favourite 360s in descending order: Anderson Cooper 360, Volvo 360, X-box 360, U2 360 tour, and the Rickenbacker 360."}
{"text":"THE BIG: This is a good spot...for just one time. Located inside the CN Tower 1150 ft above ground! Elevators are super fast going up and you get to bypass the line for the CN Tower with reservations. Plenty of seating however you want to get one right next to the window for the best views. 

THE BLACK AND WHITE: I made lunch reservations a week beforehand because most of the night reservations are booked (unless you want the late night view). Needless to say, I think lunch time is better because you can actually take advantage of the view. The restaurant does spin, so be careful when you're looking out, otherwise you might unknowingly hit a pillar.

The cool perk about having lunch/dinner at 360 is that it gives you complimentary elevator ride up to the restaurant as well as access to the glass floor and observation deck after your meal. 2 courses are $58 CAD, 3 courses are $72 CAD. Drinks are extra. I got the View From the Top cocktail which showcased the 150th anniversary of Canada while the gf got the okanagan peach. I have to say, hers was alot better than mine for the cost.

The bae and I combined the 2 courses: 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 dessert. We ordered a squid avocado toast appetizer. Both of us aren't squid fans but the chunks of squid were huge. The avocado toast was good. 

It took a lil bit for our entrees to come out. I got the scallops and pork belly, while the bae got risotto. Presentation was really nice, however when it came to taste, everything on my plate tasted way too sweet. The pork fat was melted away and was almost dry. The scallops were overcooked. The bae enjoyed her risotto but it's really hard to mess up risotto. I'd expect something great if I'm paying top dollar for an entree, so that was underwhelming.

We finished our meal with the lava cake dessert. Once again, presented very nicely but taste was bland and cold. I was expecting a hot lava cake but it was almost frozen. 

THE FINAL BAMBOO: The overall damage was $150.90 USD including tip. Views were gorgeous and service is impeccable. The complimentary pass to the glass floor and observation is a neat perk, however quality of food for the pricing is not justified."}
{"text":"It's not everyday that I get so excited about trying a new restaurant to the point where I was literally hopping up and down like a little school girl before I got there.  As far as I'm concerned 360 Restaurant, located at the top of the CN Tower, is one of those eateries where a visit is warranted at least once in a lifetime.  To say that the view is spectacular is an understatement.  The wide open windows treat diners to an unobstructed view of the city high above Toronto, and the fact that the structure rotates 360 degrees in just over an hour means your view at the start of the meal will not necessarily be the same as the end.  This very fact makes a visit to this landmark restaurant worth the while.

Now a great restaurant experience can always be ruined by the food and service, however 360 Restaurant never fell short on those two accounts either.  Our waiter was very professional and gave the right suggestion as to what we should try.  He always tended to our needs at the right time and whenever we called for him he would be there in a heartbeat, but it never felt like he was hovering. His great service continued to make the experience even more special.

As for the food experience during my visit I honestly enjoyed every bite of it.  Opting to order a la carte, we skipped appetizer so as to enjoy the delicious entrees presented on the menu.  My heart was set on the braised beef short rib ravioli with the truffle beurre blanc.  To say that I loved this dish is an understatement.  I adored this amazing concoction.  It's refined yet homey, sophisticated but playful at the same time.  The roasted bone marrow is served with the gigantic bone as a garnish and I have to admit it looked quite ridiculous on the plate but at the same time worked to draw attention to what was in front of me.  The ravioli was cooked to perfection and the short rib filling inside couldn't be any more flavorful.  The truffle beurre blanc harmonized with the forest mushrooms giving the dish an earthy and distinct umami flavor.  I could have eaten two whole plates of the dish and still would have craved for some more.  To round out my meal I ordered the dark chocolate tower with the sour cherries and port wine for dessert.  The dish was decadent and rich and perfectly presented.  The cherries and wine provided the much needed acidity to cut the richness of the chocolate and the vanilla creme Anglaise left a smooth, milky flavor as an aftertaste that paired so well with the chocolate.  I loved everything that came out of the kitchen that evening.  My friends' dishes also were superb and they echoed the same sentiments I had about how the meal was a fantastic one.

I hear people say the phrase \"When in Rome...\" all the time and this couldn't be any truer than my visit to Toronto.  I knew I wanted to see the CN Tower--a chance to dine at 360 Restaurant was just the cherry on top!"}
{"text":"All things considered, I'd rate this restaurant 4 1/2 stars, so I'll round up to 5. I have to admit my expectations were lowered after reading some of the reviews about the food quality as well as some reviewers stating that the food is overpriced.  However, I must say that everything I ordered was delicious and beautifully presented. I ordered the 3 course prix fixe menu for $65. I had the heirloom tomato salad, the chimichurri pork tenderloin, and the ricotta & sour cream torte. The pork was perfectly cooked, still a little pink in the center, very juicy and flavorful.  When you consider that it costs non-restaurant goers $32 just to take the elevator ride up to the tower, it makes this restaurant an excellent value. You're basically getting a gourmet 3 course meal for $33 when you take this into consideration. And the view is awesome!  The restaurant makes a complete revolution every 72 minutes. Our waiter was very friendly and service was great. Overall, a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"The view is the only reason I'm giving this restaurant any stars. 

The food is horrendous. Yes, it looks pretty.. But not good or worth what they charge. Completely over priced. For me and my boyfriend it was $150. Which we don't mind paying at all, when it's worth it. Garbage."}
{"text":"The CN Tower has a restaurant called 360. If you are making the trip I recommend dinner over just a trip to the observation deck.  With a reservation for 360 you get to cut the lines of all the people just paying to reach the observation deck. You also get free access to the observation deck as part of your meal price. Dinner is also a better option because the view is much better from the restaurant than from two floors below on the observation deck. The restaurant is covered in glass. The observation deck is \"open-air\" but surrounded by a mesh grate which ruins all photos. On the observation deck level there is also a glass area in the floor. It's rather crowded and people lay all over it. You can look down however and see the ground below -and the roof of the Aquarium.  If you want from the restaurant you can pay $12 and go up higher to the SkyPod. I cannot speak to the view there however as I didn't pay.

The food is also great - they have a large menu as well as some pre fix menus. If the entree you want is on the pre fix menu you should definitely go with that option. The portions are regular size so it's  quite the deal!! Service was friendly and efficient. The pace of the meal was continuos, but not rushed. Service was also unobtrusive - things just happened without interrupting your experience. The restaurant revolves each 75 minutes so you get to see everything about 1.25 times in an average meal."}
{"text":"Great view of Toronto while dining on the 115th floor
Get the Caesar salad , its pretty good.
Halibut was overcooked but came with chorizo, tomatoes and clams. 
Sweet potato fries came with garlic aioli
Make reservations because this place gets packed
They provide a 3 course meal for $60 or $72 per person
Great wine selection
No need to buy a ticket to get in the CN tower  if you are eating dinner or lunch.
One of the spots you have to visit in downtown Toronto
Can take the subway from Eaton Center to CN tower- just get off Union from Queens subway."}
{"text":"Food here is not bad for a revolving touristy restaurant. Personally I like this place better than the Vancouver one. View was really nice too."}
{"text":"Food-2 and a half, 3.
Views-5
Service-5

Yes you are pretty much just paying for a view. 
Before we went i saw a pic on here with 2 course $55 but it was $65 when we went FYI.
(I didnt get bc the selection didnt seem good)

I got the $60 10oz steak & $9 baked potato.
Steak was medium-rare to perfection but it lacked much flavor.. also tasted a lot of burnt.
My baked potato was kinda burnt too (maybe a toronto thing?)

Tried my bf baked chicken-OK.
His app salmon with goat cheese-OK 
He did love both.

The bread in the beginning was excellent.
Service was fast. 

Total $150 before tip.

Views are breathtaking.

So after youget to do the $40 views that come included.
clear floor which is small and its only above the aquarium.
The lookout was barred so it obstructed the view.
&the other looking out was a little better but if my bf had paid $40 for each for that i would have been pissed lol so up to you... one time thing in my opinion."}
{"text":"The view here is absolutely phenomenal. It's a 5-star view. The food is pretty good, I would give that maybe 3.5 stars, but
The service is about 1.5-2 stars. We had reservations here for dinner on a Wednesday night. It took the server a long time to come and greet us and when we asked him about the menu, he was not very helpful at all. Generally when I come to restaurants that cost this much, I expect the wait staff to know the menu inside and out and be able to thoroughly describe the items that I ask about. This guy did not do that. We ordered the prix fixe menu for $75 per person. Most the food was pretty good. The second course smoked salmon and my husband's duck confit salad were really good. My main course steak was big but was just good, not great, as was my husband's halibut. We had to ask for salt and pepper and the server only checked on us in passing. For dessert I had the dark chocolate three ways which was ok. My husband had this lemon mousse thing which was by far the best food item we had. Yummy. The meal was very pricey obviously, but included in it is a ticket to the observation deck, which we would have done anyways so there is some extra value added there. I won't eat here again necessarily but it's nice to say you did it once."}

We went to this restaurant to celebrate our 5 year wedding anniversary and chose veggie prix fixed lunch.

The appetizers were too good. I got pumpkin bisque and my hubby got Ravioli. The ravioli was super duper good.
For main course I got Spaghetti with tomatoes and my hubby got eggplant dish. Spaghetti was good but a little oily but eggplant dish was disappointing. Although We didn't care much as we were already full on the appetizer and spaghetti main course.
For dessert I git the tower cake and my hubby got black forest. Again the tower dessert was good but black forest cake not so much. So pretty inconsistent with the food.

I got a glass of white wine and my hubby got alcohol free beer which was really good!

The servers are very nice and attentive. The view is great as the restaurant revolves so you get a nice 360 d view of the city. All the tables are strategically placed that it is impossible to get a bad seating. This is great as I have spent same amount of money at various high-rise restaurant and ended up iven table with no view at all!!

All in all a nice experience only for special occasions beacause of the price!!"}
{"text":"You are paying for the view (which is pretty awesome at night) and the access to the observation deck/glass floor. The food was absolutely disappointing at any price point, much less $70-ish per person. I had the heirloom tomato appetizer, which was large chopped tomatoes covered in too much honey mustard dressing straight from the third shelf of the grocery store. My next course was the mushroom risotto, which was flavorless and came with odd, undercooked vegetables (yellow peppers on mushroom risotto?). Then dessert: rhubarb jam, straight from aisle 3, with a couple of strawberries cut up on top and a \"crumble\" that consisted of nothing but flour and brown/white sugar. No oats or discernible butter or other binding in the crumble topping. My husband had the prime rib, which was very good and came with roasted potatoes and asparagus. My only consolation with this meal was that we did have a spectacular view during dinner, but the restaurant's interior lights were a little too bright, creating a glare. It would have been perfect if not for that, and would have created a better atmosphere in the restaurant as well. And your meal includes access to the observation floor, which is ordinarily $36/pp. even with that, it was hardly worth the price of the meals."}

My team had a reservation at the 360 Restaurant in the CN Tower, and I have to admit I had some trepidation about the place. Given that it is a tourist destination, combined with really poor experience at other tower restaurants (such as the Space Needle restaurant in Seattle), I had valid reasons to be concerned. I am happy to say I was very pleasantly surprised.

Some of the most popular options are the prix fixe menu, where you can go with a 2 course (app and main or main and dessert), or a 3 course (all 3). They also have some ala carte options with some additional entrees not on the prix fixe menu, as well as side dishes. There is a separate seafood menu as well that features things such as the chilled seafood towers. Needless to say, there were a lot of options to choose from.

I wasn't really feeling any of the apps in the set course, and the ala carte entrees sounded more appealing than the set menu, so I decided to deviate from most of the group and order ala carte. I started with the East Coast Seafood Chowder. It was more bisque-like than it was chowder-like, but that wasn't a problem at all. It was surprisingly hearty and had clams, mussels, shrimp, and scallops, as well as a piece of double smoked bacon and a lump of lobster crème fraiche. It was a rich soup and had a great flavor. It wasn't amazing, but it was really good.

When I first looked at the menu, I had my eye on the Bison Tenderloin, and that is ultimately what I ordered. It was accompanied with black walnut and parsnip puree and west coast black trumpet mushrooms. The sauce base was Warner's Farm black currant and chili jus. I ordered it medium rare (no other way to have a filet!), and it was cooked perfectly. The richness of the bison came out very nicely, and the steak melted in my mouth. The accompaniments weren't quite as good, but they did go well with the bison. I enjoyed the entire entrée. I decided to get a side order of Brussel sprouts (with double smoked bacon lardons), and they were quite tasty. I have certainly had better sprouts, but they had a great flavor with a firm texture that wasn't crunchy.

Even though I went off the prix fixe menu, since everyone else was getting dessert, I decided to join the party. I went with the apricot frangipane tart. The main tart had big pieces of apricot, and it was garnished with white chocolate and whipped cream. It also had a syrupy sauce on the side that was sweet and complemented the tart that was a bit more savory. The tart wasn't quite what I was expecting, and it didn't blow me away, but it was good.

It was foggy when we first sat down, but thankfully it did clear up. The views were breathtaking, as you are able to get a panoramic view of the city. You also are able to go to the observation deck and walk around, which we did. The service in the restaurant was excellent, and the courses came out with good spacing. The quality of the food was great, though it wasn't mind blowing. Had the food been less expensive, I would probably rate it higher on that front, but 360 is not cheap. The soup I had was $24 by itself, and the bison dish was $85. I have had bison other places that was better and not paid anywhere near that much. I realize there is a huge markup due to the tourist aspect, and this makes the food unreasonably expensive in my opinion. However, if you are going to pay to go up to the observation deck, that fee is waived with a reservation, so from that perspective the fee is essentially built into the cost of the food. 

Unlike past experiences at other tower restaurants, I really enjoyed 360. It is not the best food I have ever had, and it is way overpriced. The views are amazing, and the food is quite good, so I would recommend doing it at least once. It is especially fun with a large group, though remember that you should get reservations."}
{"text":"View is fantastic, and the $55 prix fixe (that you have to buy) is actually worth it. Food is good and in some cases excellent. Drinks are surprisingly reasonably priced at around $7 for a mixed. 

360 - keep on turning."}
{"text":"Very average food with a hefty price tag.  We rationalize it by saying we would paid 35 each to go up to the tower totaling $75.  So we deducted that from the bill. But even after the deduction the price we paid was too much for the bland food. We ordered the 2 course pre fix dinner with seafood chowder and prime rib. The presentation was nice, the ingredients was fresh but it just had no flavor. 

We went there mainly for the view and to get a nice picture.  But they have the lights in the restaurant so bright that every picture will have your reflection in it.  We have had dinner in other towers in the pass including Vancouver and Chicago and manage to get some great picture and a fantastic dinner as well. This didn't happen at 360 restaurant.  If you do go I suggest go in the morning for lunch with cheaper ore fix meal and probably better photo opts."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and wonderful view.  The prices are a bit out of these, which you would expect.  We had a table of four, with only one bottle of wine (two drank beer) and two appetizers.  We each had full entrees.  Our bill was near $500 before a tip.  We had to request water refills and when the gents wanted another beer they had to ask.  Not what one would expect when you pay that much money.

Overall we had a great time."}
{"text":"The restaurant in itself is beautiful. It's a walk and ride to get in but even through the elevators the view is gorgeous. The ambiance and decor of the restaurant is impeccable. It's classy but trendy and do note, that this restaurant slowly rotates so you could see the full 360 view of toronto. Unfortunately, we went on a cloudy day so we did not experience the much anticipated views from the 6 *insert sad face* but we still got to enjoy our food somewhat. I ordered lobster and steak medium well. The steak came out well done fine I didn't make a big deal and my lobster was overcooked. My friend order gnocchi that was supposed to be filled with spinach and cheese but it was just filled with cheese. The waiter kindly exchanged her meal. Honestly, it wasn't the best food I ever had and you're just paying for the view. I will visit again when I return to Toronto for the view and to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Just awful. We made reservations months ago from the US and were assured a window seat. When we arrived we got sat at a table inside with another couple blocking our view at the window. We asked the host, who was rude, to have a window seat and she said we'd have to wait at the observation deck another 30-45 minutes for a window. A second later, the couple blocking us got up. We asked again and was directed to the manager Marquez. He was equally rude and said we were not allowed to switch and we had to wait another 30+ minutes. We explained that we were assured a window seat and were coming from the US. He didn't care and let us leave rather than keep our business and honor our reservation. It's not worth it for the rude management, and staff. Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Their rib eye is ok not the best but not the worse. I also had the mushroom as the side which is ok as well. The Blueberry creme brulee was fantastic though! Otherwise if you are just doing the tower I suggest grab a reservation here which is worth it adding to the entry fee for the tower as well as the upgrade for the top view. Overall it's an awesome experience."}
{"text":"We went here a couple months back for Vday and had an enjoyable time.  I have previously heard the food wasn't the best here, but when we went it was great!  
There was a line once we got there, but it moved fast so it didn't take long to get to the elevator.  The elevator ride went up smoothly all the way to the restaurant.  We were then escorted to our seat (luckily we got there early enough to get a window seat ( I highly recommend!)).

   The view was amazing!  It took an hour to go all the way around and it was totally worth it!  The city looks beautiful all around from that height.  We got to our seat around 4:45, so we saw the city from above in day light, sunset and night from the window seat.   
We took our time to order because we were enjoying the view and although it was Vday (busy day) we were not rushed at all.

   Before going to the tower,  I scanned through the 360 Restaurant Yelp reviews to find the meals with positive reviews and they were the Braised Beef short rib Ravioli and the Braised Ontario Lamb Shank.  They were both cooked well and came out to our table hot!  The Ravioli came with a huge bone marrow which we enjoyed since we are both marrow fans.  Both meats were tender and flavorful, the only complaint that I have is that the vegetables we too hard.  Everything else went well and after our timely dinner we got a tour of their wine cellar which has a lot of vintage and unique bottles.  There were Yelp comments about the food being pricey, but keep in mind it also includes the price of admission up the tower and the observation deck view as long as each person gets a meal.

*I've learned that if you know what you feel like eating, look up restaurants that have positive reviews on that specific meal (check the restaurant menu and use the search above the reviews to look for it).

   After this we got to tour the observation deck and glass floor.  The glass floor was cool and we could see the rogers center through it.  We attempted to go to the outdoor deck and once we got outside it was extremely cold and really windy.  After this we headed back down the tower.

The host on the elevator trips were friendly and open to answer questions.  We went to the store at the bottom where there was a CN tower lego (I'll post on the CN tower yelp).

All-in-all this whole trip was quite delightful and romantic which should be saved for special occasions!  :-)"}
{"text":"Came here for a group event which had a set menu. Overall the food was VERY MEH, the atmosphere is definitely very cool though as you are on top of toronto with a revolving view of the city (which was especially breathtaking at sunset).

The main courses was a chicken dish that was good but nothing special. The dessert was just a confusing mix of ingredients..."}
{"text":"it may be helpful to book a meal up there to skip the hour-long peak-hour lines to ride the elevator up, but first off, the ticket to the observation deck--as of aug 09--is only $21+tx each, $26+tx if you go for the sky pot as well. so you're actually paying at least $30 extra if you do the meal plan. which is ok if you'd like to chill and enjoy the panaromic view and all, but if you're hoping to get superb quality food, you may be disappointed. so yeah, only did it once years ago, and climbed the tower few times more after that without visiting the restaurant.

btw, their \"Horizons Restaurant\" at the observation deck level isn't any better.  food is ok actually, but service is really not on par. either they're severely understaffed, or they just don't care enough coz we're not paying $65 per pax for a prix-fixe menu. still, if i am to spend close to $10 for a cocktail and some $25-35 an entree, i expect my glass be filled with water and menu be delivered within 5 minutes of sitting down."}
{"text":"I'm so glad my father and I went here for dinner. The food was extraordinary as well as the service. I got the cold antipasto for appetizer, the stuffed pork tenderloin for my entree, and the chocolate tower for desert.  It is a bit pricey but it was well worth it. I'll definitely be coming back the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"This was a great place to visit. Getting up the tower was pretty easy for a Monday night. We made it up to the top and found a table quickly. We made a reservation but felt it wasn't needed. 

Service was kind of slow. We felt we were waiting for our a while at times for the waiter to appear. The view was amazing though. Even at night. 

When the food came, it was amazing I offered the bisque and the salmon. It took a while for it to come but when it did it was the best. I definitely suggest going here."}
{"text":"We dined at the 360 restaurant for our one year wedding anniversary. Having dined at similar high end restaurants in Toronto we were expecting similar service and food portion/quality. 

Needless to say we were blown away with the service and the food was spectacular. We opted for the price fixed menu and were allowed to switch items from both menus. We both had the beef tenderloin and shared frites with the truffle sauce. Both were incredible and the flavours were perfect. 

The appetizers we had (Caesar salad & cheese tart) was a great way to get ourselves ready to enjoy a great meal. 

The view was spectacular once you adjust to the casual spinning floor. You get to experience some breathtaking views. Yesterday was a great sunny blue sky day and Toronto never looked better!

Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I went here in October 2013 for a birthday party. The food was okay (not spectacular) but overpriced. I would probably go back only for the view and experience. The service was good."}
{"text":"The first time I went here was for dinner on a Friday evening. It was one of the most memorable meals I've ever had. Delicious steak, appeasing appetizers, and perfect desserts. The wine menu offered more than you could ever wish for and the waiter was perfectly attentive.

The second time I went was for lunch. Sadly, although the food was still very good, it wasn't as great as the first time I visited. Nevertheless, I would still highly recommend going. The ambiance if great, and nothing beats the view as you rotate."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch with family knowing that the dinner menu isnt great and would see more during the day anyways. Good call, I have to say (while patting my own back).

Service was ordinary, so was the food tho they try hard to make it upscale. The rotating view, spectacular!!! After all the CN Tower was the tallest structure up until Dubai built something ginormous just to steal the title from us Canadians..... 

Oh well, for what it's for.... at least you get a \"free\" ride up/down the tower!!"}
{"text":"We went for my mother-in-laws birthday and were very unimpressed. It's eye wateringly expensive for the quality of food and service. 

It took us ages to get a server to take our order, food was just ok. My mother-in-law's main was cold. Yes, the view is nice, but it's not particularly worth it."}
{"text":"Most of my observations have already been made by others on this site.   But I would caution diners to check their bill carefully.  Three of us ordered the three course meals ($65 and $75) but there was a charge ($13) for one of the appetizers.   The waiter apologized profusely,  making me more suspicious that this \"error\"  is recurrent.   Also,  the suggested tips are based upon the total bill,  including the substantial  VAT.  Other than that,  it's OK food with an incredible view."}
{"text":"Beautiful view, beautiful menu.

It's a Landmark restaurant and while the prices are steep the view is worth it.  We had a dinner at sunset and enjoyed the meal tremendously.  While it wasn't cheap it was something memorable ... and that's what matters.

The selection of ON VQA wines and ON craft beers were also very nice"}
{"text":"Very good ecperience, nice view, good food, the restaurant is full, but service is still fast."}
{"text":"This was my first time in Toronto so I felt obligated to do the CN Tower thing.  With admission to the top of the tower included and no lines to wait going up the elevator, the restaurant is not a bad deal consdering the amazing view you get at each seat in the restaurant.  

We had the ~$65 prix fixe menu with uninspiring choices.  Salmon, eggplant parmesan, roast chicken--basically wedding food.  Trio of bruchetta was over-salted except for the one with artichoke puree.  The first bite of my main course salmon was good.  A nice crisp skin with the right amount of fat.  But the rest of it was dry and blahh.  Portions are huge.  I'm guessing they cater to the American tourist crowd.  

I will never again return for the food, but it's a place to experience once, and only once.  Also, I suggest getting something a la carte and enjoy the 360 view, then head down for some quality late-night snacks in downtown Toronto.  

People who get motion sickness easily, beware!  I was feeling a bit ill by the end of our meal, but that can be easily cured by going outside to the observation deck and getting blasted by wind 500m above ground."}
{"text":"The food and the view were all great. 
But first, we found hair in the dish, like we saw the hair inside the fish after we flip it. We told the server and he didnt even apologize, he just said its an open space, hair is everywhere.  
Second, the server almost didnt do anything. Didnt add water for us, didint take the empty plates, didnt even ask if we r doing ok... Very poor service."}
{"text":"I ate here with my boyfriend's family after doing the Edge Walk.

I had never been but had always wanted to go. It was a really nice place and I had always heard good things, but I've also heard it's a tourist attraction and is very overpriced.

It definitely wasn't cheap! I think the prix fix is like $85. My food was all great don't get me wrong but if I wanted to splurge on a nice restaurant for an occasion I'd probably pick somewhere else. 

It's definitely a cool place to experience at some point in life though, and it really does spin! All the sections of the restaurant are numbered so you can find your table when you get back from the bathroom! Quite funny. I avoided the bathroom because sometimes I can be a bit of a dope with directions. You also also get a beautiful view of the city so make sure to snap a bunch of pictures before it gets too dark!

Would I return? On someone else's coin for sure :P"}
{"text":"Ok so it's impossible to review the restaurant without also reviewing the view from the CN Tower. It's phenomenal. It's worth a star - star and a half probably on its own. If you had McDonald's in a rotating restaurant with a 360 degree view of one of the world's great cities it would be 5 star McDonald's. 

And I almost wish that was the food we were getting - because the sticker price for the restaurant is incredibly high compared to the quality. The wait staff was great but the beer and cocktail list is quite poor for the price and the food leaves quite a bit to be desired. At most the restaurant is a 2, maybe a 3, and the price really just drags it down. We regularly spend $100-$300/meal when we go out but the food and drinks are on a much higher level. I'll give the restaurant credit for friendly wait staff, but that's about it. 

I get that it's the CN Tower and it's a unique dining experience, but over charging for subpar food is never cool. 

Make a reservation if you want to get a seat by the window (like we did) but be prepared to spend around $200 for one appetizer, one main dish, and one drink each for two people. Get there 20 minutes before your reservation, and try to make sure your credit card gets a nice view as well - since it's going to be doing all the work."}
{"text":"360 Restaurant brings you an incredible 360 degree view of downtown Toronto in a setting that rotates as you dine. Most would visit this restaurant for the views and to take advantage of the free passes to Toronto's CN tower viewing platform just a story below, but the food and service exceeded expectations and make the 360 degree restaurant a great stop for a special occasion or visit to Toronto.

We quickly skirted past long lines for the viewing platform and were whisked in a separate elevator up to the restaurant and promptly seated with a window view for 2 (booked ahead on OpenTable). We went for the prix fixe menu for $65 which included appetizer and a main course. For appetizers we went for the heart of romaine (large portion, heavy on dressing, crunchy croutons) and the zucchini carpaccio (nice presentation, fresh veggies). For the mains, we settled on the duck breast (rare, small portion) and the prime rib (large cut of meat, tender, average mashed potatoes). Highlight of the meal was the view (obviously) and the service. Waiter was very attentive, filling glasses, checking-in, offering to take our photo, and most crucially - did not rush us as we enjoyed the view. 

Full rotation takes about an hour - snag a window-side table, and enjoy the scenery high above Toronto. From the restaurant, you can then descend one level to the madness of the public viewing platform, which shows you your money at 360 was well spent for the private and intimate view."}
{"text":"The food was not anything great. Paid $65 for a main and dessert. 
You are paying for the view. Not the food. 
I got a steak with a spinach purée type. It was not as great. Then dessert I choose was the ice cream and cookies. It was not good at all. I have had better ice creams and cookies elsewhere. Really to have something like that on the menu and the presentation is just disappointing. 
Not sure how the other stuff on the menu is. My ice cream was literally like the one the kids got. The cup and everything. 
For a restaurant like this they can really do better tasting food. They make things sound really fancy on the menu and the way it's written out. But once you order it. You get disappointed with taste and everything. But like I said I only had only the steak. 
I remember going about 10 yrs back and wasn't impressed with the food then either. 
I gave it 3 stars for the view and the fact I didn't have to wait in line to get access to the observation floor. 
I went with kids. They had chicken fingers and fries. Cost was $40 for that. Which is fine since you are also paying for the access to the other floors with this price."}
{"text":"I love 360 restaurants! This is a must do for anyone visiting Toronto. It was beautiful! The food was delicious, we ordered the prix fixed menu. Our waitress was amazing and super friendly. I can't wait to come back again in October!"}
{"text":"Went here with the plan to have our best meal in Toronto and with a great view even though we knew it was pricey. The great reviews in Yelp/TA had me fooled this time and it is the first time that has happened. 

I had a 4 meal prix fixe menu that was:

*Tuna tartare 3/5 Fresh & tasty No complaints but nothing extravagant 

*Ravioli with charred butter 3/5 Not bad but as above nothing i will remember

*Prime rib 1/2 This was not good at all. Looked like road kill and it was just lacking flavor. 

*Cheesecake with rasperrys 2/5 A step up from bad but you can get better at Cheesecake Factory at half the price. 

The price around 75 $ without wine and tip would have been fine with good food but the quality of food was not very good in my experience. I love evrything from a good burger , a meal at chain restaurant as Outback or exclusive high end food depending on my mood. 

This was below the Outback/TGI Friday/Cheesecake Factory etc in taste but with approx double the price. Not happy at all. 

Sevice was ok but nothing more. You really come here for the view wich is great but i recommend you going up in the tower, look at the view and then have a great dinner at The Keg or somewhere else. 

The value here is 1/5 and on our 2 weeks in the US/Canada eating on all kinds of places this was the worst considering the price only beaten by the dry White Castle burgers."}
