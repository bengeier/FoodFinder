{"text":"We came here on a weekday for lunch, and unfortunately left disappointed with the food. Campo food hall is a cafeteria style restaurant that sells Spanish salad, tapas and desserts. I really don't want to write a bad review, but unfortunately I was just not impressed with the quality and price.  We ordered a bunch of stuff, as seen in the photos, the pirogies, the quiche, potato salad, etc. One dish costs about $8-10, which is a reasonable price if the food quality meets it, or the portion meets it. I know this is a tapas place...but there was nothing special about each dish, other than the fact that I've tasted it before somewhere else at a better quality and price. You can get a full sized meal for extra $2 on top of a $10 potato dish. Overall, it's really overpriced for what they're selling.   On a positive note, their service was really good and I appreciated them explaining the different dishes to me.   However, I will not be coming back here. Will be checking out other Spanish tapas place in the city."}
{"text":"My experience was unlike some of the negatives reviews. Would highly recommend coming for dinner!   Arrived around 7 and seated promptly for a group of 4. Surprised that we hardly had to wait as we didn't have a reservation! Dimly lit and warm with cool design touches - loved the booth seating and lighting above it!   Food service was reasonably quick and they were very attentive. They have vegan options. Highly recommend the tomato bread and salsas. Bread was crisp in spite of being drizzled with oil. Salsas were bright and flavourful. We also shared the eggplant and potatoes with peppers, which everyone really enjoyed.   Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The decor was nice, the food is just ok but overpriced. The octopus was not fresh at all and had a funky taste. Meatballs were tasty."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the braised beef empanada and chicken empanada, they were tasty.  We ordered octopus salad and the amount of octopus for the price was ridiculous. The salad itself was average. We tried to order 2 other things (flatbread and vegetable empanada) and they didn't have it. We were there at 2:30pm but since the tapas menu is so small, it's super disappointing when they run out of things. Overall, the prices are super high (example: olives for $7) for small portions and average tasting food."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Spanish restaurant in town. Unbelievably tasty dishes. It feels like you are actually in Spain. Excellent cocktails as well and an ambiance that is truly exceptional. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went for dinner - nice atmosphere, great cocktails and SUPER attentive staff, the sharing plates were great (especially the beef with mushrooms the the cod croquette), the big let downs were the dirty rice - a gluey mess that came served in a stove top pot (90% it wast the pot it was cooked in) with what looked like a metal spoon from the dollar store and the whole roasted eggplant which was undercooked and under seasoned."}
{"text":"Their soft serve cannot come close to the soft serve at McD's and yet holds the pricetag of Soma's gelato. Ridiculously terrible soft serve, feels sickly afterwards. And while we're at it, he churro (priced at $2.60) for a tiny piece will send so many more patrons to Pancho's bakery (kensington market). You all should stick to what you're good at, which isnt soft serves and churros."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with the braised beef empanadas with the chipotle mayo. Tastes like heaven to me. Perfect golden pastry outer layer, with meaty stuffing.  Otherwise, I have tried the chicken sandwich, which was delicious, and very filling. And the ham and cheese croissant which is tiny tiny, like half the size of half of a croissant lol, and a skip for me.  I love how there is an ELXR inside so that I can grab a yummy smoothie to accompany my meal."}
{"text":"So even though I came here with two dudes, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this is a great date spot. It's elegantly decorated, has nice dim lighting, and is located in a great area for follow-up restaurants/bars if things are going well. The beverage menu is pretty impressive and the cocktails are pretty reasonably priced.  I didn't have the opportunity to try the food here, but my friends were pretty happy with what they received. It's standard tapas-fare from what it seems. The prices did seem a little high for what they received, but I'd say it's in line for the area and surrounding restaurants."}
{"text":"Went for dinner at Labora. Flavours were good, but it was incredibly overpriced for such minuscule portions. I've been to several tapas places where they served literally 10 times the portion size Labora provided, at the same price range. We ended up paying $114, and went up to Chinatown and Kensington Market to have \"second dinner\"."}
{"text":"Tried Campo Food Hall for the first time last Thursday. I understand they are new so am giving them the benefit of the doubt with my rating.  My friend arrived around 8:15 and put his name down and it took about an hour to get a table as they had just sat most people there. There is no bar to wait at for a drink so we went next door to wait.  Once our table was ready we were given one menu to share. I get it is tapas and sharing is a thing but print more menus. Had to ask for another one.  We ordered the following:  - Shrimp special which was described as a massive shrimp. It was not (see photos). It was extremely delicious though. - Potatoes and Egg w/ Bacon. Tasty but was kind of an odd recommendation I think, but nice sauce. - Fried Stuffed peppers - Another special and very tasty. - Octopus - Very delicious! - Tuna - I really love tuna and this was delicious but I think the accompaniments to the tuna completely overpower the fish. Still tasty though. - Olives - Huge bowl and very tasty. - Bread - If we didn't have to wait about 20 minutes to get it I'd probably have enjoyed it more.  The service was where I think this place really lacked. Other than the issues mentioned above, all of our food items came out at the exact same time which meant things were going to get cold unless we ate super fast. Space it out better please! Several times we had to flag servers down instead of them checking in. Also the bread mentioned above we just wanted something to sop up the sauces but it took so long to get by the time we got it all the plates were cold. The server was kind enough to remove this from the bill at least.  The other thing I found was the prices are quite high here. $19 for a small shrimp or $32 for a couple pieces of tuna makes this more of a special occasions kind of place for me.   Overall though I have to say all of the food was very good and the space is really nice. Hopefully they can work out a few of the smaller issues and this place could be a fantastic restaurant.   My rating as is would be 3.5/5 but I rounded up to give them the benefit of the doubt for being new. Definitely worth a try though!"}
{"text":"Coming back from a 2 weeks vacation in Barcelona to news that there's a Spanish food hall that opened brought a smile and giddiness of excitement! It's only been opened for a few days, so there's still a few things missing like a liquor license. What they did have, was enough to satiate my palate.  Before choosing what I wanted to eat, I was able to get a tour from one of the owners, got introduced to the chef (who's idea this food hall was) and got an explanation of their concept, the different stations and what to expect.  I came in around 2pm and found a bustling food stations: salad bar, sandwiches and pastry & tapas. Since I was alone this visit, I decided to forego with tapas and salad - instead I tried their savoury coca (buttery and flaky flatbread type with eggplant and red peppers), manchego cheese croissant and crema bomba (akin to a doughnut with creamy pudding filling). All 3 items were yummy and worth a repeat visit, especially once liquor license has been obtained - also with company to share the bountiful menu offerings."}
{"text":"Overall: Really expensive and small portions.  Atmosphere: (3 stars) An interesting concept, very basic.  You go the the counter and choose things you would like to eat, at the end of the counter you pay for what you ordered.  Then you sit with your food and eat.  Food: Expensive: its it $4 for a small croissant sandwich, $7-$9 for a few pieces of octopus... None of it was amazing.  Service (3 stars): It is self service, but they do bring water to the table.     I would not go again."}
{"text":"My husband and I have visited Spain and Portugal many times and cook Spanish food at home. We have tried several of the top Spanish Restaurants in Toronto, and this is the absolute best. The Chef's high level of knowledge and love put into the food is apparent. Go. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Labora (inside Campo Food Hall) on the Saturday night between Christmas and New Year.   Food:  Food was excellent! We had the calamari sandwiches (so great!), grilled octopus, patatas riojanas, queso manchego and joselito coppa. One thing I do recall is that the description for the Octopus appeared inaccurate- it said it came with crispy potatoes but really it was this potato puree with crispy shaved potatoes as a garnish, so I wouldn't consider the potato in the dish to be a side.   Drinks: Drinks were great as well. My friend had a gin and tonic which came in a fish bowl(!) and I had   Vibe: Vibe is great! Music was loud but we could still have a conversation, and I think this place has great potential to be a weekend hangout.   Service: Service was great but they forgot our octopus when we were done eating everything else we had ordered. However once we let them know they quickly got us a dish and gave us a dessert on the house- toasted brioche!  I would definitely return to Labora again."}
{"text":"I went here a few days ago. I loved almost everything I ordered. the broccolini was great. the charred octopus was excellent (though I would've preferred a bit more octopus). the beef empanadas were the best I've ever had. the only thing that was average was the bomba (which is sad because I love those things).   the space is beautiful. the service is friendly, maybe a touch slow. overall, it's a great place that I'd recommend in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices for self-serve/table-serve tapas and lunch items. Spotty service."}
{"text":"Super new and not fully up and running yet. But still had a good experience for lunch here, last Friday. Looking forward to returning when they're fully ready.  ATMOSPHERE: Trendy, cultured and fun vibe. It really transports you to a European market. Much smaller in scale - but the same warm atmosphere. Front of the shop sells goods from Drake Store.  SERVICE: The staff were wonderful from the moment we stepped into food hall. They were well prepared to initiate all new visitors with a thorough explanation of the landscape: food hall / market up front - and seating / restaurant at the back.  PRICE: Our group of three skipped the juice and salad bar - and got a bit of everything. aka went for tapas-style grazing here. So cost added up quickly. We shared 8 items/dishes and it came to $15 per person.  FOOD:  Olives - A big bowl with various types of olives. Good for sharing.  Mushroom Cocas (like pizza) - Very good. The flavour was fantastic. A crowd favourite!  Grilled Octopus - Good. Wish the texture was a bit meatier/chewier - but flavour hits the spot.  Stuffed peppers - Good. Texture is very soft. Cheesy goodness.  Rice - lots of toppings in it including veggies and seafood! Not labelled as paella, but similar.  Veggie Empanada - Tasty!  Chicken Empanada - Really flavourful! One of our top items from today.  Spanish Tortilla - Tasty! Ask them to warm it up!    Overall, a promising place for its early days. Can't wait to come back and try their restaurant for dinner one night!"}
