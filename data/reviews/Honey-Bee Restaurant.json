{"text":"the chinese lady was friendly, they have been there over 35yrs.. the main course was good but the cornsoup sucks, its a faux corn soup made in chicken broth, thats not how 2 make it, corn soup is always thick and sticky but they were lazy to mess with it they just threw few handfuls of gene modified canned corn into the chicken broth, 5mins of work.... the design is very old not good to come here for romantic dinners..."}
{"text":"For Canadian Chinese food it meets all of my expectations.  I love the homestyle tofu and always look forward to ordering it.  They have this style of cuisine down to a science.  One time I even got a takeout hamburger and fries there which was quite decent, except I wanted extra ketchup for the fries and he put it all on the hamburger!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend was looking at going to a chinese food restaurant that is near by our house and we get to the restaurant (and its about 30 or more degrees outside) they have opened the windows and doors so it isn't too likely they we would cool down while eating our food. I'm not a fan of chinese food but I went for my boyfriend as well as they had \"canadian food\" options.  I ordered the Fish and Chips (which I started out not having great expectations) they bring out on a tiny plate my fish and chips which wasn't bad but the plate was so small the fish managed to slip off my plate and onto shirt leaving a nice grease stain. I would also hope that for 8.50 maybe I would leave full, I didn't find my meal filling.  My boyfriend ordered Combo 3 and he didn't really like it. It wasn't too little money for the amount that he spent and the chicken balls had a tiny portion of chicken, some had air bubbles and a lot of batter. He didn't enjoy the meal he left feeling ripped off and still hungry"}
{"text":"Owner man is very rude , doesn't allow customer to use washroom short change me $5 addition to the original price. Your store soon go bankrupt."}
{"text":"Not a fan of their food. I've eaten their takeout specials a few times, each time when I'm really hungry hoping it would taste great, but I've been disappointed every time. There's an aftertaste to their Chicken Fried Rice and Chicken Balls I don't like. Their sweet red sauce is also off. I used to prefer C'est Bon (Yonge/Eglinton location is now closed) ... or I'd even take Manchu Wok from a mall food court over this place. Their specials are definitely well priced - but unless you're starving and really craving Chinese, don't bother."}
{"text":"We have this delivered on regular basis...the dinner for two is more then worth the price...don't listen to the other reviews...then food is really good"}
{"text":"This place for food is just ok. Me and my boyfriend went here one night after we found out that our regular chinese place was closed. It was a little over priced for what we got but not the worst I've seen, normally you would get more dishes for the price. However we were hungry and happily took our dinner home, we started eating and found the food to be quite bland although it might be good if you perhaps were intoxicated and were hungry. The food ended up even worse because my boyfriend found a long hair in his food - or should I say his mouth. Can we say GROSS? If there was no hair I'd probably give it a 2."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place is going downhill. I've ordered from here at least 50 times and the quality has been degrading. Pretty sure the lemon sauce was made with rotten lemons this time; I had to throw it out. I already stopped ordering the honey garlic sauce because I was served beef juice too many times.   The rice and vegetables tasted old, like something you'd pull out of the freezer after a month or two.   I can't get the taste of rotten lemons out of my mouth. I think this is the last time I'm ordering here, unfortunately. You can't make quality food while cheaping out on ingredients."}
{"text":"BRUTAL service- Ruined our night.   We all know those nights when you are starving - at 6:30 I picked up the phone to order for delivery. Waited patiently for 45-50 minutes. Nothing. I called the restaurant to inquire, and the call taker told me the food was not ready?  They were busy. Then she said she would have to call the driver- I could not get a clear answer if the food was a) not prepared b) prepared, waiting for driver to pick up c) with the driver- on the way to us.   She said she would call the driver, and call us back. She immediately called us back, thinking our phone number was the drivers- then, confused- she hung up. At this point arguments in my house amongst hungry people are starting to build .   Got a call back 10 minutes later (now a full hour since I ordered) telling us the driver was on the way, assuring the food would be there in 15 minutes, but I should give her the visa number now - ummm, yeah- not going to happen. 15 minutes passed, and surprise, surprise - NOTHING.   I called the restaurant back AGAIN -  it is now 8pm, my family and I were hungry when we ordered at 6:30. 1.5 hours after ordering, and the driver talked to us- claiming he got lost (Google maps anyone?  We live on a street 10 blocks away from the restaurant by the way).  We asked 'well are you bringing us the food?' And he actually said \"No\"- so I hung up and got Pizza Pizza.   I will NEVER order from this place again. I have had pick orders from them before, and the food is exceedingly average - but this service experience put the nail in the coffin for me. Bye bye Honey Bee. You won't be missed."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving a 2 star is they use decent chicken in their food. Food is bland and sauces are extremely mild. I had to put soy sauce , vinegar and salt in everything I took home. May be it's just me but I have been eating chinese for the past 8 years in north america and I believe they can do much better.  There was lots celery in everything and it was hard to chew. When I removed the celery I had hardly anything to eat on my plate."}
{"text":"Food is bad and they tried to short change me.  Don't go, but if for some reason you have a gun to your head and must eat here...at least count your change."}
{"text":"I live super close to this place, so I finally tried the special that's always on the board outside. The board says General Tao chicken (like it always does) but what I got was some sort of battered chicken with a sauce that tasted like gravy. No red colouring at all. At first I thought they had forgot to toss the chicken.   Portion was surprisingly small and 90% rice. I ended up dousing it with plum sauce and sriracha. Admittedly, it fulfilled my hungover greasy North Americanized Chinese food craving.  Wish it had actually been General Tao though."}
{"text":"I make better Chinese food that Honey Bee and I'm Latin! I went and got food from here today because I was very hungry and thought I'd try it. I asked if they had Kung Pao chicken and they said yes. I am wondering if they have ever eaten Kung Pao themselves. I got a large amount of celery with 2 miserable almonds and a little bit of chicken. I'm not exaggerating this. It wasn't good. How are they in business? :("}
{"text":"You know what? I had really low expectations going in... so that helps.  This place was just fine! It's been in the Beach for 30 years... amazing!  I was feeling too lazy to cook, and it was nearing 8 p.m., so we went to just-eat.ca and looked at our options. I don't think Mr. Rosie S. and I have ordered Chinese delivery for ourselves EVER (lots of other types of delivery food, but somehow never Chinese... weird).  Honey Bee also has a Richmond, BC location, though I don't know which is the original.  We ordered Spring Rolls (veg) and Egg Rolls (meaty) for $1.50 each to start as well as the Honey Garlic Spare Ribs app ($9.75). I wasn't sure about what would be included, so we also ordered a couple of orders of steamed rice ($1.75ea) just in case (I threw leftovers into a chicken soup today). Turned out we didn't need it! The Spring Rolls could have used more seasoning or flavouring of some kind, but they were totally passable. I was also starving... so I basically inhaled them.  I got the \"Mixed Vegetable Lo Mein Chow Mein\" (I know, but that's really what it's called) for $8.95 and Mr. Rosie S. got the \"Chicken and Mixed Vegetables\" for $9.25.   They sent six fortune cookies and TONS of soy sauce and plum sauce packets. Nice! No chopsticks, though, which I thought was odd.  It arrived EXTREMELY piping hot - highest temperature delivery food I've ever had! Love that.  However, most of the vegetables (carrots, broccoli, onion, celery, mushrooms, bean sprouts, baby corn, bean sprouts, many of which I suspect were canned) were undercooked and everything was a bit greasier than I would like. That said, we were both full and not sick at the end of the meal, and there were lots of leftovers. Total bill came to $45.71 with tax.  No doubt we'll order from here again, which cannot be said for many of the take-out and delivery places we've tried around our 'hood!"}
{"text":"Use to think 5 stars but now no, good food but they have lost two long time customers.   Not Service Dog friendly though they are reluctantly AODA compliant regarding them."}
{"text":"This place definitely wasn't as horrible as I was expecting based on the other reviews. Food was definitely ok, your typical Americanized type Chinese food but it was all prepared well.  We had the lemon chicken - large breaded cutlets, they used white meat (yay!) and asked for the lemon sauce on the side (it was the typical yellow fluorescent type junk but tasty). We also had a beef dish in black bean sauce and an egg fried rice.  Service was quick and efficient, however we were the only ones eating at 6pm so we had the waitress all to ourselves.   Was basically as expected. Seems to be more of a take out joint type of place but the seating inside was fine, and a tiny patio at the front."}
{"text":"Worst place I've been in a few years.   Service is bad, food is below average and you can't even use the washroom even if you are a customer.   City of Toronto should close this restaurant."}
{"text":"Standard \"Chinese-Canadian\" mall food at Beaches prices is how I sum up this place. Almost everything is deep fried and covered in red sauce. I've eaten their food on several occasions due to it's next door proximity to my friends place and my random need to eat. The food is blah and seasoned to only the most delicate WASP palate.  You could bring your great-great-grandmother here so she could taste the orient and she would be pleased, however to my own fault I haven't liked \"Chinese\" food like this since I was 4 years old and would try to drink the red sauce straight.   What I find most offensive about this place is that they don't have deep fried chilli squid... The staple of almost another place like this and when you ask for it they look at you sideways and say \"NO SQUID\""}
{"text":"The folks were very helpful. The rice was so good!  My daughter was very happy with her meal."}
