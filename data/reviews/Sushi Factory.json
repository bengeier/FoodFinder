{"text":"This place everytime i used to go there, smelled gross. dirty bathrooms and i felt like i was in the movie Aladin due to its structure. The waiters keep forgetting something on my order, and/or they take FOREVER to give it out.   GO TO THE SUSHI FACTORY ON EASTERN INSTEAD! Theyre very fun ( they interact and acknowlege your presence) Nice and good vibes. Cleaner. Good location.  As a sushi lover, I keep comming back to the one on Eastern everytime."}
{"text":"Pros Large selection of rolls, sashimi, the usual.  All-you-can-eat  includes kitchen items such as teriyaki chicken, tempura, and green tea ice cream for dessert.  What I liked most is the ability to order half rolls with the all-you-can-eat.  This was great the first couple times when I wanted to try out many rolls without getting stuck with one I didn't like.  Cons Living in Calfornia, the fish in vegas is not nearly as fresh and a little grainy.  Service was ok.  Usually they are not busy, so it isn't a hassle getting service from either the bar or the dining room, but during busy times, don't bother sitting in the dining room for all you can eat, or else expect to wait 20-30 minutes between orders."}
{"text":"My hubby and I have been coming here for years ever since we moved to this side of town, and it's always amazing, every single time we come! We love it because of the all you can eat for just $24.99 per person, and considering how much some sushi joints cost here in town, you definitely get your money's worth here. Their AYCE menu has a ton of choices, and even appetizers are included. My only complaint is that sometimes it takes a while for the food to arrive, but they do a very good job at coming back to check and see if you like to order anything else. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi place. I'm a sushi lover and gone to all the sushi restaurants places in Vegas and this is on the top of my list.  I just wish they have a location in SOUTHERN HIGHLANDS!!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi rolls are okay. Not very authentic. The tuna was lacking in flavor, probably frozen. Teriyaki was really sweet, tasted a lot like mikarashi (rice cake sauce). Next time we'll spend our money at Miko's Izakaya."}
{"text":"I love this place so much.  It is by far the best all-you-can-eat sushi that I have found.  Everytime I am in Vegas I make sure I hit this place up at least once.  They always have very fresh fish and since it is a full menu made to order all-you-can-eat you can be happy ordering the nicer stuff and not worry about breaking the wallet."}
{"text":"A laid back, low key sushi restaurant.  Best for all you can eat, particularly if you are a roll fan.  Personally, I am.  Yeah, rolls might not be \"true sushi.\"  I know that, but for some of us, that's what we like.  If so, you're going to love Sushi Factory.  Personally I think the best aspect is that it is the only AYCE place I have found in town that doesn't have a time limit.  As for service, most times I've been (and I've been a ton!), it's fine.  If it wasn't, why would I go back?  But yes, if it's busy it can get a little slow, service wise.  Again, however, if you are there for AYCE, there is no time limit.  And most times my hubby and I go with a group of friends so we like to take 2 hours and sit and talk.  And we do that whether the service is fast or slow, the time we take is up to us.  The only reason they get 4 stars instead of 5 is the decor, tables and chairs.  Really, Sushi Factory?  You can't invest in some matching seating, new tables, and updated decor?  Please try.  I think more people would give you a chance."}
{"text":"Love this sushi restaurant.  They have one of the best AYCE in Vegas.  And through the month of October 2011, the AYCE price for lunch AND dinner is *******$18.95******** per person.  That includes almost all rolls (except the super fancy ones) and sides like edamame and miso soup.  However, this price is ONLY available at the Henderson location.  My favorite roll is the Spicy Tuna Crazy Roll which is a deep fried spicy tuna with jalapeno and cream cheese.  It's sooooooooo good, just the right amount of crunchiness and subtle spicy flavor.  My new favorite roll is the I.T.Y. (I Told You), also deep fried but with shrimp.  (I may or may not have a penchant for deep-fried rolls.)     Although the menu seems overwhelming, the rolls mainly tend to be a variation of shrimp, salmon, tuna, scallops, eel, cream cheese, avocado and jalapenos.   The space in this location is a bit odd; one-half has tables and chairs like, uh, a restaurant.  The other-half is sort of just an open space with a pool table.  It's VERY casual.  The service does tend to be slow at the tables, so its best to sit at the bar if you want quick and efficient service.    Nonetheless, the sushi (and chefs) here are great.  They also have a frequent flier card, buy 10 AYCE and 1 free!  If that's wrong, I don't want to be right..."}
{"text":"I was not impressed by this restaurant at all. The flooring is all carpeting and it is disgusting. Please vacuum and deep clean it. Even better just replace that nasty floor. The menu was dirty and sticky. Just clean the restaurant!!! The rolls were nothing to brag about, just average food. Even the roll presentation was bad. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I miss this place does anyone know where the sushi chefs went?"}
{"text":"As far as sushi in vegas goes, DO NOT waste your time or money here.  there are a number of places better.  what i didn't like: the menu was hard to read, and didn't explain the types of rolls.  are they fried or baked or normal? nothing like that. not enough options as far as rolls go.  and the rolls we did get, the tempura battered ones were soggy and gross, some of the rolls wreaked of fish (fresh fish should not smell like fish).  overall, it was a very bad experice, will never go back here again.  for real sushi, go to sushi on trop, still #1 in my book"}
{"text":"After a recommendation from my husband's co-worker, we were excited to try Sushi Factory's AYCE sushi.  Big mistake.  1.  First impressions - The decor is a little bizarre and is a thrown together mish mash of old pizza parlour and 60's diner. 2.  Service - Slowwwww.  In defense of the poor young waiter that was attempting to do his best, they were understaffed and we were told that there was only one sushi chef (the owner) in the kitchen. 3.  Food Appearance - Lacking to the point of being \"iffy\".  The nigiri fish to rice ratio was skimpy and cut uneven.  Even the rolls were haphazard and thrown on the plate. 4.  Food Taste - Average to scary.  The rice for the nigiri disintegrated when you attempted to pick it up.  Some of the fish was barely cool to room temp.  A simple rainbow roll was bleh.  DON'T get the Japanese Lasagna as its a glop on tinfoil.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Well, the rolls here are pretty special. The \"Jimmy the Attorney\" and the OMG roll are fantastic as is the price, $18.95 all you can eat. The carpet was in need of a vacuuming and some of the \"food safe\" practices were questionable. I will try it again in a few weeks."}
{"text":"Horrible. Would give a zero rating if possible. Service is non existent. Food is average but just takes too long. Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Ok Sushi factory is kind of a tricky place the first impression when you get in is like an under designed office. I won't recommend a first date in this restaurant but!!!! The sushi is one of the best in town and they have great deals such as it as much as u can. You have to try the Tuna Poki and the miso soup Thumbs up"}
{"text":"So I like sushi and went for the AYCE option.  Not sure if I needed to do this but I wanted the freedom to choose what I wanted.  The service was friendly although sparse.  I didn't feel like I was \"guided\" through my dining experience which I expect anywhere I'll be expected to tip.  It's the little things like having to look for someone to seat me when I entered and whether I pay at the table or at find a register.  I can see why folks recommend to sit at the bar.  The sushi was good and I had no problem getting uni or anything else eclectic (and expensive) that I ordered.  For the price this is the best sushi place I've found, yet.  Would definitely recommend them for anyone looking for good sushi without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"My previous review was written 3 years ago.  I've been back MANY times since, but my friends and I tried to go there tonight (2/15/12) and it was closed and there was a red warning sign on the front door from the Henderson Constable's Office.  Everything inside looked the same, so I hope whatever legal issues will be resolved, but I'm not holding my breath.  It would suck because I have a $40 gift certificate which, if not redeemable at the Sushi Factory West location, might be worthless.  The quality of the food has never seemed to go down these past couple of years, but the place was NEVER really busy, even during peak times.  There's approximately 10 sushi places up and down Eastern between Anthem and the 215, so I'm guessing this place might have succumbed to the glut of competition in the area.  Let's hope not!"}
{"text":"I am really not a fan of this place. I think it is more on the 2.5 star scale. The rolls are filled with too much rice. Th nigiri is OK. I really do not have much to say about this place. It is just eeeeeeeeeeh. Mediocre."}
{"text":"What all other sushi resturants should be judged by. Decor...ehh Sushi Awsome !  And we go there for the food ! These Items are better than anywhere else that we have eaten. 1. Unagi. this is how we judge sushi bars. Theirs is fresh, warm & the sauce is sweet but not to sweet or gooey. 2. Cajun Albacore.  This is the best sushi anywhere, great cajun seasoning with a light  vinagar flavor. 3 the best sellection of rolls anywhere.  I am a eel sauce, creamchese avacado fan so we love the Bank Roll, Joe the Man, Arizona roll (5 stars), Double D, and almost everything else we have tried.  I'm pretty sure diner is 23 or 24. in my opinion the very best sushi bargin in Las Vegas. All good things guys, see you out there!"}
{"text":"For Mother's Day, I wanted to check this place out since I remember always going to a Sushi Factory by W. Tropicana over 5+ years ago, but it closed down. Not sure if these are the same owners? Nonetheless, this is located where Cheeburger Cheeburger used to be.   The reason I gave it a 3-star was for the service. Customer service is a huge deal to me. Treat others how you wanted to be treated, right? As we walked in, we had to stand at the front counter looking confused because no one acknowledged or greeted us right away. After awhile, I initiated myself to ask if we just seat ourselves or...? which prompted the girl to seat us.   We waited about 20 mins until we were asked about our drinks AND another 7 mins after to take our order. I'm not sure if the server (male) was overwhelmed that day or having a bad day, because he seemed impatient with us ordering a whole bunch of appetizers and rolls. Waited another 20-25 mins, and found out the ticket order for our side dishes and sushi rolls got lost, so the server had to retake our order again. At this point, I felt a little irritated of course and disappointed since it felt like we were not valued customers by this guy. Here I am, trying to be humble and give him the benefit of the doubt that he's just overwhelmed. One thing after another, we were charged dinner all you can eat prices when we technically  arrived at 1:50 pm. They corrected that and comped 1 Ayce for us (thank you).   Aside from our experience, the quality of sushi was great. I enjoyed the nigiri and special rolls. Our favorite roll so far is the \"Big Easy Special.\" Def recommend. Also, the coconut shrimp tempura was de-lish. We are still willing to try Sushi Factory again, maybe just not on a holiday."}
{"text":"The food was great, the service could've been better. The server wasn't wearing a smile and forgot to put plates on our table after they served the food. The atmosphere was not very lively and the music didn't match the room and seemed inappropriate for eating sushi. They gave us a 20% off next visit, I'll probably order take out instead."}
{"text":"lets just say the only good thing about this place was that there waitresses were pretty.   as the review below me stated the all you can eat is pretty much the only good thing about this place. you can order only FULL rolls. you can't order half rolls so you cant even get a taste of everything on the menu. also you are only allowed ONE desert -_- so there goes desert selection also. service was okay, but at times pretty slow. as i said the best thing about this place was the waitresses.   if your up for the trip theres a nice little sushi place called XTREME SUSHI in southern highlands.... much more better."}
{"text":"Went there during the grand opening and we waited for about an hour and a half for a table.   As busy as it was i still enjoyed this sushi spot a lot. The nigiri was good and the fish was fresh. They also have dishes like the sashimi salad that are excellent.   We had to wait awhile for the food but it was understandable because of the 2 for 1 special they had running for the grand opening."}
{"text":"I was NOT impress!!!  I'm surprise how they stay in business after personal experience and then reading everyone else's experience..oh wait they stay in business because they over-charge you!  I went to Sushi Factory for a mutual friend's birthday and it was pretty late and I came already having alcohol so when I was eating the sushi I thought it was me.  So the next day I was talking to the people who went and they all confirmed what I \"tasted\" the night before, it was blaned and tasteless and service wasn't all that great!  I will not go and have already advised all my sushi-loving eating friends not to go at all!"}
{"text":"It angers and confuses me why it's so difficult to find a sushi joint open for lunch in this city, so I'm giving an extra star to sushi factory for simply serving me.The sushi was fresh and the chef was cordial, both big factors in my opinion of sushi restaurants. The aptly named Sushi Factory is just that however; they pump out thinly sliced basics and run-of-the-mill rolls. I would return if I was in the area and needed a quick dose of fatty tuna, but wouldn't go out of my way. Also I'm pretty sure our chef's accent was constructed for our own entertainment. If I was a more sensitive person (or asian) I might have been offended."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere great service and good sushi! This will be our new sushi spot. Thanks for the good service"}
{"text":"My partner and I have really busy schedules so it's a rare occasion when we have date nights. We decided to try this sushi spot because my yelp notifications kept bugging me to check it out, lol. So we did and we're so happy that we chose to have our dinner here!! All of the staff are welcoming, kind and patient with their customers and the service is also super fast with the orders as well as  refilling drinks :) we came in around 6:30p so obviously we were expecting a wait and to our surprise it wasn't crazy busy at all considering it is a Friday night! Sushi portion size is PERFECT, not too much rice as most ayce spots will cover the rolls with a 2 inch layer of rice, wtf!! The fish quality is also one of the best I've had in this town, it's so soft/tender and doesn't have a strange after taste. So happy this place opened up because most of the sushi places down on rainbow are over priced and so over crowded that the food isnt really worth the wait, We'll most definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here and i think the food, service was great and quick. I would definitely return! The Hot and Juicy was great. And all the appetizers on spot."}
{"text":"I like to  start the day with positives, so on that note I will say that Sushi Factory has a fun college-like atmosphere, Staff is friendly enough, and the restaurant is bright and welcoming.   What's not pleasant however, is the fish.  It was horrid. Not fresh AT all. The sushi rolls were no better-the rice lacked the vinegar kick it needed and again the substance was skimp/tasteless.  We ordered about 6 rolls, none were spectacular. The Dynamite roll is supposed to be \"off the hook\", but it was no better, it was simply disguised underneath a thick baked mayonnaise concoction    The miso soup was the only thing I half enjoyed.  The salad was a cut of ice berg lettuce with a less than exciting dressing (that I believe was supposed to taste like ginger?).   Thank goodness I didn't go for the all you can eat!  Ending on a bright note, I hear they have good happy hour..."}
{"text":"Finally a AYCE That's close by. They are actually good and the place feels and looks clean. No long waits like other AYCE Places."}
{"text":"A $10 lunch that includes TWO veggie rolls, stir-fry, rice AND soup? Plus decent service. Might take a bit of time, but it's made fresh to order so definitely worth it. Lunch special is on til 3 so we miss the normal lunch rush hours & get faster sevice.  Not the super chic decor, but I'm there for the food, not trendy vibe that doubles the prices."}
{"text":"The tuna was melt in your mouth. Everything was so fresh. One of my favorites was the Carrot Top (spicy tuna, cucumber with seared tuna, avocado, deep fried carrots topped with orgasm sauce and eel sauce. The staff are all very friendly. I was surprised it wasn't very crowded for a Friday night but I may have arrived early for dinner. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"So decided to try a new spot since it claimed to be a sister property to one of my top 5 favorite sushi spots. To get there and be told that the 2 for 1 that was advertised for Mon- Fri had ended on Wed, since I drove 30 min to get there still decided to try it. There was 2 ppl at the bar, 1 table of 2, and my party of 3...the wait time was long the first person to order at my table was the last person to get their food. They were out of a few items I tried to order, the waiter was not too familiar with the menu and they only had 1 flavor of mochi. I gave 1 star only because of the service..please advise your patrons of items you don't have before allowing them to order..thanks but no thanks I will stick to what I know. Forgot to mention no liquor license, so no"}
{"text":"Used to come here with friends for a cheap and decent meal. Wasn't ever great, but it wasn't horrible either...  Today, was a different story... Let me start by listing everything that was wrong with our experience: 1. The restaurant was filthy. The booth we were offered was littered with rice. The place looked like no one had cared for it for a while. 2. Our sushi looked like it had been chopped up and thrown together with no care or experience. 3. Our rolls only contained a small sliver of fish, compared to what we are usually used to.  Any person that has any knowledge or experience of what good sushi is would tell you the same. I don't know why anyone would give this place better than a 2 rating..."}
{"text":"didn't know what to expect read a few reviews on here...it was really good! It's right by our house so its convenient to go to ...my GF loved the Nigiri and we thought all the food was fresh...we'll definitely be coming back here again soon!!"}
{"text":"PROS: -portions were generous -food was fresh -reasonable price  CONS: -decor desperately needs an update(diff heights of tables and chairs) -slow service when they're busy"}
{"text":"Was the first sushi joint I've ever been to. At first I thought wow this place is great ! But now I think that their rolls are to boring and simple.  Nothing tasted super fresh and delicious.  Last few times I got dragged here by friends I hated it. My memory of this popping my sushi cherry is about all that keeps my score from lowering."}
{"text":"Tried this place a couple times in the past along time ago. Figured if they are having a customer appreciation night ($11 AYCE) the food must have gotten better - WRONG. Eel tasted bad, fish on other rolls tasted funky, other rolls that were supposed to be mildly spicy were burn your mouth off hot so much that we couldn't even eat it (they did take it back no questions asked though so 1 point for them), so much rice on rolls they were hard to eat, Tempura in rolls seemed as it was pre-made & sitting in a steamer somewhere to keep warm as it wasn't crispy or warm as it would be if it came right out of the fryer into the making of your roll & to top that off had shell & fish bones in one of my rolls. Out of the 5 rolls that we got only 1 of them I liked (Dave roll was the winner). Actually was surprised that the nigri was fresh tasting after the experience with a couple of rolls.  Service was extremely bad as well. Ordered 3 items right away took 10 minutes to get 1st 2 then another 45 min to get the 3rd. At the start of the night the waiters were hounding the second we walked in the door about we wanted before we even had a chance to look @ the menu then after a while (still not that busy) seriously had to trip a waiter to get some service. Could have walked out w/o paying it took that long to get the bill (25-30min). . Count yourself lucky if you didn't go & next month when they run this promo JUST SAY NO! To me the $11 wasn't worth it. Would have rather paid $15 for 2 items total instead of AYCE at a better place (like Island Sushi where they have 1/2 off all rolls Mon-Wed all day). Their motto \"we sell good dead fish\" well that's all they have is \"dead fish.\""}
{"text":"Delicious! Waited just over an hour to take advantage of their generous Facebook promotion and it was totally worth it! Excellent, tentative service. Tasty and creative food. We will absolutely return!  Flash forward to a few weeks from opening ... we have been here several times, I'm now the Duchess and it's just as delicious as the first time. The service is great, everyone is so enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the menu.   Try the skewers or the Spicy Tuna Tar tare!!  I'm so thankful I live across the street, I look forward to coming here for years and years to come."}
{"text":"Sushi Factor is a big wave and we hand to try it out and one Sunday afternoon we decided to give it a try the sushi was pretty good. the kitchen needs some work. the flavor ok lots of things to order on the menu easy packing on rainbow and a bit pass warm spring."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for Sushi Factory. It was the first AYCE sushi place I tried. I used to LOVE coming here.. but ever since Oyshi opened (and it's closer to my house too) I frequent that place more often now.   My boyfriend and I decided to come here tonight since we haven't been here in awhile.. and I couldn't believe how dead the place was! When I came here before, it used to be so packed & it was at least a 15-20 min. But not tonight. I don't know if maybe it was because it is Halloween weekend or what.. but times sure have changed!   The AYCE sushi is still the same.. good variety of rolls (we like the Bank roll, Westwood roll, Olli roll, 3-10 roll, and many other ones I forget the names of), nigiri, side items, and of course green tea ice cream or mochi for dessert! Not bad for the AYCE price ($25.00) but Oyshi definitely has this place beat.   It is not a bad 2nd choice :)"}
{"text":"Overall food was good. Not the best AYCE sushi I've had but it was good. Didn't care for all the saucing on the  as some of it was vingegar based it seemed."}
{"text":"The reason I am giving Sushi Factory 5 stars....  A group of five of us went for dinner tonight and ordered the all-you-can-eat sushi.  As we were seated, our waitress mentioned something about it being $10.95 per person.  We thought nothing of it because, when we come here, we usually order the all-you-can-eat sushi at a price of about $25 per person.  Even the $25 per person price is reasonable, considering there is no time limit annnnd the menu includes ALL specialty rolls, sides, etc.    So, we ordered specialty roll after specialty roll...all quite delicious!  The staff was very attentive and did not hesitate to continue to bring us more rolls in a timely fashion.  At the end of the evening, they brought us our bill and a couple people in the party thought there had been a mistake because it was so cheap....and the waiter told us that they were having a special tonight...all-you-can-eat....$10.95 per person....really!  He said they were offering it at their Henderson location tomorrow (11/29/11) and, for those people who came in tonight or tomorrow, they would be sending another offer for the end of December for another AYCE special!  Needless to say the \"bargain bill\" was for real!  :P    This was a pleasant way for them to reward existing customers and to attract new ones.  Hopefully, they will offer this deal again in the near future.  Be on the lookout.  :P"}
{"text":"Great all you could eat sushi restaurant! Near our neighborhood. Love the super white tuna and rolls. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Nothing draws a crowd quite like BOGO grand opening offers- see opening week reviews for H20 and Zero Degrees for some context. In short, if you build it (and discount it, and advertise it on Facebook), they will come, en masse. I was able to take advantage of their opening offer with Tony T and Chris V, who graciously allowed me to crash their party even though I didn't wait on site (using the time instead to hit a nearby gym). Foodie Friendship Goals!  In short, Sushi Factory was pretty average for AYCE in Vegas. Fish quality was okay, with nigiri sliced a hair thicker than elsewhere rather than paper thin as experienced at other openings. Unfortunately, a lot of the fish was flavorless and bland, and the rice was both falling apart and lacked any discernible vinegar notes. But they make up for it with some standout dishes like the Spicy Tuna Tartare stacks (they also have a salmon version), Coconut Shrimp, and a carpaccio dish. I also appreciate their selection of hand rolls and riceless rolls, as this is a place where those who stick to nigiri are likely to be dissatisfied. Their dessert menu is very limited, but that's not what I come here for anyway.  Service was fair, considering they were predictably busy with lines literally out the door with a 2 hour wait. Other reviews mention limited servers and slow speeds but I didn't experience anything distressing. Typical new-business kinks coupled with large crowds should be met with at least some modicum of understanding by customers who opt to come in under those circumstances, which is why my rating is rounded up instead of down."}
{"text":"Gets worse every time...  Good prices,but the service and food usually suck.  I'm not saying the food is absolutely terrible because they've had their days, but I'd rather pay more somewhere else where I'm more sure I'll be happy with the food before I even step inside than have to pray I get them on a good day here."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE it here!!  The quality of sushi is fabulous!!  The servers are super nice and fast!!  The ratio of topping vs rice on their sushi is perfect (not too much rice).  You MUST check out their vast selection of cut rolls though!!  Ask Takashi for their most popular ones, and he may design one and name it especially after you if you're lucky!"}
{"text":"Unaware of good Sushi places on this side of town, I finally settled on this location and am ver pleased that I did so. Took my younger brother for his first real sushi experience and we both had a great time. The service was great, much more friendly and personnable then I expected. The food was as I expected, if not better, and the $25 AYCE (with the loyalty card too) was exactly what I expected to pay."}
{"text":"This place is very good for sushi.  I always get the AYCE and you will get your money's worth.  I usually go nigiri and their fish is fresh.  They are also good on the rolls.  They also have a list of the top 10 sushi rolls ordered or most popular and it is also a good list to reference to if you are undecided.  The chefs are also very nice and personable.  The service is good and pretty quick."}
{"text":"All the rolls are good, the service is good, it's clean and they play hip hop and edm. Thank you thank you thank you yessssssss godddddd"}
{"text":"6 years ago, this was my first and only sushi spot in Vegas. Haven't been back in 3-4 years. After trying many other places around town, I brought a few people here for an All You Can Eat extravaganza. Very glad we did!!  EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!!! Unique rolls and very high quality. Totally worth $25  My friends who had never been here before raved the entire time. If you are reading this, be sure to review Sushi Factory and tell others."}
{"text":"During the open promotion, this place advertised one and give us something else. Scam place."}
{"text":"I had a really bad scallop and got sick. I will never go back here!"}
{"text":"Will not be back!!! ordered more than 10 items only about half of them came, has to wait for over an hour and half for 2 more rolls to come. (Not exaggerating). The rest of the foods never came. Seriously it's 10 of us, not like to ate a lot already.  Rice is too hard, all hot foods are cold.  Good luck with business!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat sushi in Vegas.  Whenever I have friends come in from out of town who want sushi this is where I bring them first.   They have a great variety of rolls, and they don't put a brick of rice in your sushi just because it's all-you-can-eat like other places do.  You can even order half-orders if you just want to try out a roll.  Only place I know that has cajun albacore... it's great!   Overall, great quality and friendly staff.  Too bad its a bit far from where I live. =T"}
{"text":"all my kitchen orders were missed such as shrimp tempura, seaweed salad, and udon. drenched in sauce, wish they laid off a little because rice kept coming apart when picking it up with chopsticks. really small restaurant."}
{"text":"I always go to sushi way on flamingo and paradise, but it's quite far from where I live (southwest) so I was so excited when they opened sushi factory on rainbow and warm springs. too bad I missed the 2 for one all you can eat deal promotion, but I did try it when they first opened, it was amazing. fresh fish, they use clean and fresh oil for tempuras, a huge selections of appetizer. and compare to the all other all you can eat sushi places in southwest area, their sushi rice is the best. I am a pescetarian, my eating out is always sushi, another good thing good about sushi factory is, they have good options for vegetarians. this veggie rock and roll is so yummy!!"}
{"text":"This is mine and my husband's second time here.  It's a great place for good sushi. It's pretty new. I reccamond this place for sure."}
{"text":"I go out for sushi about once a week and I continuously come back to this place for all-you-can-eat...You can get oysters and terriyaki and 25 different rolls and edamame and quail egg shooters and dessert and apps and it's all GREAT! Naka (sp?) is always there at the sushi bar to make you laugh and smile as you eat delicious sushi. Tell the sushi chefs what you like (ie: spicy and hamachi) and they'll create something on the spot."}
{"text":"Came here based on recommendation from a friend. So glad I listened! We all did ACYE and honestly everything that we got was delicious. We got a good amount of the nigiri, appetizers, and rice rolls. They also have no-rice rolls (wrapped in cucumber) which is always refreshing. I like the fact that they don't pack on the rice. It's a good rice-to-fish ratio. I was so hungry I didn't even take pictures! But trust me, you can't go wrong with any item on the menu. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place!!!!! Such a wide selection and great sushi!"}
{"text":"There is only 2 servers working on their Grand Opening!  Phone number listed was not working.  Very long wait with no waiting area."}
{"text":"I enjoy sushi and everything that makes sushi good sushi: the freshness, the flavor, the texture, and even the people that serve it to you.  I can't give half a star so one star will be my rating. Here, let me tell you why. I'll take a different approach and make a list just in case an employee there reads this and decides to help the restaurant out.  1) Service with a smile:  It only takes 1 bad seed to ruin the whole crop. I've been here a few times because my friends enjoy this place (?), but the service here just doesn't fit any other sushi restaurant I've EVER been to. It says \"60 minute limit\" on their menu. They really must stick to the T on this one because after 60 minutes, they just ignore you and forget what you ordered.  2) Flava-flaaaav!:  Hit or miss when it comes to the freshness of their fish.  Sometimes it's on, sometimes it's off.  Whenever I ordered my AYCE anywhere else, I get half orders (4 pieces instead of 8) just because I want to taste everything.  It's a recession, but it ain't worth giving someone the stomach flu or worst!  3) HGTV: Watch it! Give the place a face lift with some paint or decorations. Some traditional Japanese lamps are always decorative. When my friends and I eat here, we're like 20 deep. We get the tables in the middle of restaurant put together and they're uneven and we're on display for everyone to see. I'm charging for pictures next time.  Hope this helps everyone. This isn't a review to knock the place but to give it some constructive criticism because face it. This is Las Vegas and everyone deserves good food with good service. We live in a DESERT, people! ;) Happy eating!"}
{"text":"It was only my family of 4  and another table of 2 and the food still took FOREVER they also never brought out our 1st orders of sushi. The food was just okay, i've had better.   The reasons why i'm giving this place 2 stars was because the staff was friendly and gave my kids a free juice box."}
{"text":"My visit to Vegas included stopping here, thank you Kat, where I ordered the Shrimp and Veggie Tempura (about $6) and the Japanese Lasagna (also about $6) and my husband was able to get something he enjoyed too the Chicken Teriyaki bowl. It came with soup and salad, I ate his soup but we didn't touch the salad... No particular reason. They have and all you can eat for about $24 but I was very full from what I got.   The Japanese Lasagna had Yum Yum sauce which I was later told was a spicy Mayo.... It was VERY good but they shouldn't put so much on there. I scraped off the rest halfway through. When I go back to Vegas I will definetly dine here again.  Only bad thing was the service. And that wasn't terrible, they just didn't come by very often and we ordered before the rest of our group came. We got our food right before they walked in and the waiter came back maybe 20 minutes later but we were already done. I thought they're supposed to come by and make sure everything is alright. Our extra guest said \"it's ok, there's always fast food\" lol. Gotta love great company."}
{"text":"This place used to be one of our \"go to\" places..just because it has a very convenient location and works late.The food quality is \"almost\" average..the fish is not as fresh as you would find at \"Sushi Mon\". The good thing about it is that they have all you can eat for $25 and then they give you a card and each time you had \"all you can eat\", they stamp it and after you got 9 stamps, the 10-th time it's free..as my boyfriend and I are \"sushi lovers\"..it wasn't difficult to get a few of those cards stamped . The owner is nice too..but he is kind of moody-one time would be really friendly and then the other it's like he's got smth against you."}
{"text":"Today is the grand opening with 2 for 1 price AYCE. I already lowered my expectations to long waits, busy/frustrated servers, and unorganized orders. So the overall experience was just about as expected.  I got there at 6pm and there were already 2 hour wait time. Good thing they say they will call us when it's ready. Long story short, we were seated around 2.5 hours later.   We got seated by the bar so we got lucky cos the chef is there to take our order real quick. So I'll give the chef 5 stars.   But the waiters and waitresses need more training and need to organize more when it comes to taking orders. We ordered multiple things that took so long. Each time we double check with them they had no clue if the order was put or not. I'd give them 2 stars for trying.  Food quality is not bad. Taste is just as good or bad as other AYCE chains on rainbow. The honey bread was cool. Overall experience was just average for a newly open venue."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Vegas!!!!!!!! When iI lived in the neighborhood I went there like 2 or 3 times a week. While I've had better sushi, you CANNOT beat the price. many rolls of 8 are $4.25, rolled well, and if you get two rolls they give you free miso soup and salad. that's 4 dishes for like $9.00 total. Plus I've come to know the staff by name and they're great.  Trans-Friendly- Yea, def. There are Thai chefs there so they're obv cool, the rest.. probably ok."}
{"text":"I have been eating sushi for about 20 of my 21 years of living. My father spent a few years living overseas in Japan before I was born and ever since I could remember we incorporated Japanese cuisine into our otherwise American family menu. I myself have experienced different sushi making techniques for the past 8 years or so and have frequented many sushi restaraunts, with friends that are from Osaka Japan and this is the end of my slim credentials...  My wife and I were in Las Vegas recently for our honeymoon, driving through back to Utah from California. After catching a showing of Phantom of the Opera the the Venetian and having only a few dollars to spare we looked for a relatively cheap sushi place willing to sacrifice ambiance to save money.   We stepped into the Sushi factory and were greeted by our server Toshi. The menu did have a rather medium to large variety, more than enough for the average sushi consumer. We were pleasantly surprised with the quality and freshness of the fish, as well as the price for the amount. The service? Yes, rather laid back, but fitting. Toshi was an excellent waiter and we really enjoyed his sushi insight.  In short:  -If you don't want to spend money for pomp -Like a laid back environment -Like to leave full -And enjoy sushi  Go to sushi factory."}
{"text":"I was there today, I signed in at 3:45pm, got seated at 5pm. Thank you for the 2 for 1 special. I killed time by taking my daughter to LOL kids club.      After an hour, we started walking back. I ordered most of the food I wanted to eat right at the start. I wrote my list while I was waiting. The servers were so nice and always checking on us.  Im coming back for the skewers. Thank you again for the awesome deal and awesome service."}
{"text":"Sushi Factory was my first all you can eat sushi spots since 1999. I haven't been back since the early 2000's.   Since I started eating ocean flesh again,  I went to pay them a visit with my Living Social Deal Discount.   I ordered a few of the nigiri items, yellowtail, Salmon and red snapper. Both of the yellowtail and salmon was cut very thick which made me a little perplexed if the thickness made it chewy or was it the lack of freshness.  I would say skip this one and go on to the next AYCE Sushi joint..."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to drive across town till we recently saw this new place that opened up just down the street from our home. My husband and I are very picky when it comes to our sushi and this place definitely delivered! I mean we went home thinking about how amazing the sushi actually was. Needless to say we returned just 2 days later to enjoy their sushi again. We will definitely be here weekly!"}
{"text":"This used to be Sushi Club but they changed owner I believe. The staff was friendly. Sushi was pretty good. Lots of variety rolls. They had a special roll called Muscle Buster that we tried.. It had gyoza, shumai, crab meat, spicy tuna. I think I like my gyoza and shumai separately though.   For desserts - Their fried banana ice cream was good! They also have the standard mochi, green tea and plum ice creams."}
{"text":"AYCE is awesome. Makes me wonder though why every time we come visit it's a different chef. Hmmm *scratches chin.* Nonetheless, experience was never bad. I would come back, especially if they keep the chirashi in the menu. :)"}
{"text":"This place is as bad as the other sushi factory years ago on trop and rainbow? it was either shut down, lease was over, and/or no profit??"}
{"text":"It was our first time coming here as it was referred by my friend. This place is fantastic and the waiters and waitresses are very attentive. The food is very delicioso!"}
{"text":"The short version: It's an AYCE spot in the Southwest, so I had to check it out. I had the Jose Special roll, a bunch of nigiri, some skewers, cucumber w/crab salad, and yuzu sorbet. Overall, I'd come back, but I'd be in no rush to.   The long version: Decor: 5/5  Modern sleek. I'm feeling the vibe here down to the music. I feel like I should have had a glass of white wine. (They are waiting on their liquor license.)  Cleanliness: 5/5  No complains. It was spotless.   Food: 3.5/5 Everything was done well, but it wasn't mind-blowing or great. For the nigiri, I had garlic tuna, garlic salmon, and cajun albacore. All were very good. I also had the crab nigiri, which I'd call passable for AYCE. There was the halibut nigiri that I'd label as edible but a bit chewy. I'd never order that here again. On the skewer front, I tried the garlic and mushroom. Mushroom was good. Garlic was so-so. The only roll I had was the Jose Special (in: spicy crab, cucumber; top: cajun albacore, avocado; sauce: spicy ponzu, jalapeno). I enjoyed it. Pass on the gyoza. It's not great here. Cucumber with crab salad was okay but not memorable. Yuzu sorbet was more like a yuzu snow cone. That's not a bad thing. Just not what I was expecting. I loved it though.   Service: 4/5 I sat at the sushi bar, and the sushi chef was definitely 5/5. The waitress was friendly and cleared plates. She just was not on top of the drinks, and I had to flag her down for kitchen orders after the first one. She gets 3/5."}
{"text":"fucking delicious!  this is absolutely the best sushi i've ever had.. and the all you can eat deal includes practically the entire menu.  it looks pretty blah from the outside, but upon walking in, it was to my happy discovery that the interior was much cuter & more spacious than the entrance would have had me believe.  the rolls are creative, [Lisa Lisa will make you squeal with happiness], and the value is great.  the only possible complaint i have is that my waitress rarely came around.. but i was too busy stuffing my face to mind.  i must reiterate:  fucking delicious!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in this place, and I didn't even get a chance to eat.   I called and they said they weren't going to be busy.  Then all of a sudden their phones went off the hook.  I called millions of times to get updates on status because I live far.  Got there by 645 and they weren't accepting any more customers.  I understand there's a deal going on this week and it's your grand opening, but at least have your phones answered.  I walked in and all the waiters looked so unorganized and it looked like a complete mess.  Probably won't try coming back, I walked into a complete disaster."}
{"text":"Wanting to take a night off from \"The Las Vegas Strip\", the hubby discovered the Sushi Factory from the hotel phone book.  $24.95 per person for all-u-can-eat sushi?  Why not!  I order a spider roll, sam's volcano roll, oysters, a salmon skin hand roll and miso soup...just to get my money's worth.  The quality was good but the service very, very S-L-O-W.  I think they do this on purpose to get you full so you don't order more sushi.  Tip:  Order as much sushi as you think you can eat and wait for all of it to arrive before starting to eat.  It worked for me!  The hubby wasn't as fortunate and spent a lot of time waiting for his sushi to arrive.  The kids just ordered from the regular menu and finished their food long before us.  Thank GOD they brought their Ninendo DS' to play while they waited for us to finish eating."}
{"text":"Stopped in by myself & sat at the bar for all you can eat.. the entire staff was friendly & I felt as if I was being pampered lol. I love trying new food so I let the bartender know that & he made me so many yummy new things I've never even tried before. They offer smaller portions for all you can eat which is nice when you're solo. I'll definitely be back. You guys are awesome"}
{"text":"Sushi factory !!! Best kept secret. V is the man behind the counter. Freshest fish in town. Shout out to the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Came at 10pm for AYCE, plenty of space, clean establishment. Nigiri was super tasty, and like everyone says, the rice is on the light side. portions were appropriate - not too large. Decor and presentation was on point. Very nice ambience. Standouts - tuna tartare and the fact that they do half rolls. I love that they have several options for riceless sushi.  My boyfriend doesn't like masago on anything but I do, staff remembered that detail on every order."}
{"text":"What service! So attentive to your all you can eat needs. The food presentation made me want more. The fish was cold and rice was spot on. Make sure to look at the sushi bar board you will miss the daily specials. Try the Chicago fire role. Want something not crowded not loud like other sushi places in rainbow this is your place."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time we came due to we got 20%off from previous visit! Now they eventually got uni on stock! And also offer special menu daily! It's worth to give it second chance!  Good service and choices of food such as skewers and side dishes"}
{"text":"I was only willing to try this out because my roommate wanted sushi and Goyemon was a 1 hour wait. Honestly, I would have walked out as soon as I stepped in but my roommate and her friend wanted sushi asap. When you walk in, it feels like they bought the location from a Mexican restaurant and never changed the decor or the plating. The menus were dirty and I didnt see any asian customers inside. (I judge a good asian restaurant by how many asians are dining at their location.) I saw every ethnicity but asian! I knew I was in trouble lol. All I ordered was one California roll and it wasn't good at all. Probably the worst California roll I've ever had. Worse than the ones you buy prepackaged at the grocery store. EPIC NOM NOM FAIL!!!!!!!!!! If you like sushi, don't come here."}
{"text":"I understand they just opened but it took 3 hours to get most of our orders, we had to cancel the other ones because it took so long and I think it's mostly cause of the girl server is disorganized with her orders. Either she needs to use a bigger paper to write her orders with or use another type of tool. Even my water took 30 minutes and constant reminders just to get it. I was just gonna give 1 star but the guy server/manager is very polite to apologize for the really long wait and would promise that it will get better. And I hope it does.  The pork belly, Johnny, and Baked mussels are my favorite.   I hope they get more organized and faster with serving. They just need more staff especially with the promo going on."}
{"text":"BEFORE: Surprisingly I rated this place a 4! Before I get on about the food and service, I'd like to say that I have been a customer for years! It started off as one of my favorite sushi joints in town until I noticed the customer service was not on the level as I remembered it to be.  The food was also not that great either, where they piled on rice and cream cheese into each roll! So, if I was a yelper back then, I would have given this place a solid 2!  AFTER a year or so, I decided to go back to see if there had been any change.  When I walked in, I noticed the place had been painted, and was definitely much better looking than I can remember.  I did AYCE, and as much as I love sushi, I don't know how  to use chopsticks (Yes, sad story. haha). So, I always ask for a fork =). The server came running back with my fork like he was some sort of knight-in-shining-armor, which is a good sign for me, because everyone usually forgets my darn fork =(.  So the food came, and I noticed a definite change, it has become even better than I can remember! The service was also wonderful. The servers were much more observant of their customer's needs, and they were just adorable!   *NOTE: Another thing I remember is that they have a Ladie's Night Special on Wednesdays, where AYCE dinner is the lunch price! Take advantage ladies! And another good thing is they are open late! I think til 3am? (I'll have to update the times and specials as soon as I go back)"}
{"text":"I pretty much come here once a year in August after a softball tournament with my team. We always seem to have a good time and enjoy their rolls. It comes out to less than $30 p/p after all is said and done with taxes and a drink so it's easy to bring a large group. Sushi tastes fresh to me, not sure why it's been getting such bad reviews on that.. The only thing if I were to be picky is that the servers could have a little more personality. Also, the last time they made a big deal about the bill because they forgot to charge for one ice tea. So as we were paying, they were in a frantic to correct it and left with the bill without taking our money and when they returned they said it was a new bill because they had forgotten the iced tea. One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that. There was not even an extra line on the credit card slip for a tip. We will probably continue to return if we have a large party in the future. Seems hard to get seated in Vegas at a lot of restaurants if you're in a large party. But not this place. Always seems empty for some reason."}
{"text":"Saw this on yelp and thought I'd stop by for some sushi take-out. When I went to pick up my order the waitress opened each to-go box to make sure my order was correct, which it was. The sushi was awesome and very fresh, this place is my favorite new sushi spot."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for AYCE. Nigiri rice to fish ratio is excellent. Overall dope place"}
{"text":"Service was decent. Never had to ask for a refill on water or tea. Food was good. I don't do rolls cause it's not traditional sushi. More tailored for people that cringe at seeing raw fish on a slab of rice. So I'm not ranking the rolls. Sushi was fresh though. The sushi chef we had was very personable. The other chefs seemed way less personable. Not unfriendly but kind of stoic. It doesn't bother me though cause I'm just there to eat.   Interior is pretty drab. Could be updated but i it's okay if they're making money. No sense make things extravagant.  One of the waiters seemed disinterested in serving us but later on we had a very cheerful waitress.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I thought the food was fresh and nicely prepared with decent portions. Again just sushi and at the counter. Also,  I'm not comparing this to high end Vegas strip sushi or top notch Japan places I've been to.   Great value and I'd return again."}
{"text":"The FB all you can eat special appears to have turned into a failure since it was just cancelled shortly after midnight on 3/21/2018. After 2 days, the average wait time was 2 hours 25 minutes. The deal is not worth the wait unless you have plenty of things to do while waiting for them to call you when your table is ready."}
{"text":"After a long weekend on the Strip eating tacos el gordo every day or the occasional $6 slice of pizza when I'm too hungover to make it out of the lobby of the casino this place offers a rejuvenating meal for the long drive home. Im happy, my wallet isn't completely empty, and $5 hamachi kama-come uppp. I just hit red 3 times in a row and let it ride that's how I felt as soon as I walked in here! What a steal! Any way my advice is come here to eat some bomb azz sushi $60 for 5 people. You'll have more money to throw on the tables, booze, titties or mountains of snow whatever you desire! Whoo!"}
{"text":"The service was friendly and attentive, the food came out quickly, the restaurant was clean and decor and ambiance was nice and modern. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the nigiri wasn't that great, but the sushi rolls, appetizers and dessert were on point, definitely worth checking out if you live in the southwest."}
{"text":"Good and cozy. Friday night came here and wss seated right away. Service was excellent. Sexy lazy special roll was magnificent. It is a coconut shrimp roll. Yess."}
{"text":"Very cute place love it service was nice everyone was so nice. Has a big menu lots of options"}
{"text":"Good and friendly service. Decent sushi (I wasn't a fan of the Volcano. My favorite was the Rainbow). The price for their all you can eat sushi was just right. The only thing that I wish they had was NBC Sports so we can see our Vegas Golden Knights play... then this place would be perfect to come back to."}
{"text":"PRETTY DELICIOUS, and DEPENDABLE.  Sushi Factory is always a good time. It used to be better when NAKA worked there but, i guess he went on vacation... and never came back. Ooooo, creepy. ANYWAYS, Try the   THAT'S HOW I ROLL.  i invented it. ...seriously. i did. :)"}
{"text":"I will say the bad reviews on yelp are because of the 2 for 1 deal, that so many people had to wait for. It's nothing to do with food quality.   We had our table as soon as we arrived. The sushi is fresh and good quality. We had great and attentive service. Definitely worth coming to regularly for sushi."}
{"text":"People giving poor reviews bc it was very busy during the grand opening or bc they ended the BOGO promo early need to get a life. The place is not very big but intimate in a nice way with good decor. Understandably there was a half hour wait but I expected that so I showed up early (what smart people do instead of complaining on yelp). They ended the BOGO promo which I thought was too ambitious to begin with so I didn't mind it, I came to try the quality of the sushi not the promo. I tried several apps including sashimi salad, screaming orgasm, and salmon tar tare. All were excellent but the screaming orgasm really stood out, a must have. Between myself and my gf, we tried the majority of the main nigiri choices. The fish quality was great, above average of most other ayce places. I really liked all the garlic options, the garlic tuna was outstanding (if you really love garlic, which I do). I also had the Chicago Fire roll which wasn't as spicy as I expected for a roll with the word \"Fire\" in it but it was still delicious. Our server Christina was great and attentive despite being busy during dinner rush. Don't listen to the negativity, check this place out."}
{"text":"Staff is extremely nice and helpful. The AYCE menu is extensive and very fresh. I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this new place out yesterday with my friends - 6 people. We got there 1:15pm, got seated a little after 2pm. (They had 2 tables available good for 6 each table at back. I don't understand why we have to wait almost an hour to be seated on one of the empty table I mentioned??) Anyway, moving forward, server took our orders on small pieces of paper. 1st roll came 2:35 pm. Our rolls and appetizers came one at a time... omg! 6 people are hungry and we have to share 1 roll or 1 appetizer at a time! I expected the wait time to be long due to the promo but i didn't expect the food to be served so slow! The food was awesome though! I loved the pork belly, spider roll, johnny, spicy edamame, hot tea.. i would have tried more but I had to leave without even getting my dessert due to time. My friends stayed and waited for the rest of the food. They said they had to cancel some of the other orders because it took sooo long! Even for water refill took forever! My friend had to grab the pitcher herself by the counter to refill our glasses.  In my opinion, they should have overstaffed than understaffed.  Servers should be organized. Got to forsee and be proactive since they advertised the promo. Would I try this place again? Probably because their food is good. I'll give it another chance to see if they have improved."}
{"text":"Very nice sushi place. Foods are fresh and clean. Staffs are really nice. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"This sushi was DISGUSTING. The service was horrible and everything I tried  tasted like charcoal: burnt. Sushi isn't just deep fried and full of cream cheese. They even overcharged my card by $10!!  NEVER coming here again! IF I could give them no stars, I would."}
{"text":"def fan of AUCE and this place isnt bad but its not great. not a huge menu, at least not full of diff things. a lot of the rolls are very similar. weve been twice and both times they only had 2 sushi chefs and one guy working the floor, thus very slow service."}
{"text":"The sushi here is great! The price is competitive and the service is (usually) excellent. However, when I compare this place to Sakana Sushi, Sushi Factory gets a solid 4 stars! We will absolutely be back, not my favorite spot in town but the sushi is just about as good as it gets."}
{"text":"This place is...hmm...in a strip mall.  It looks a bit rustic from the inside and out.  We sat at the sushi bar instead of a table.  Our chef was cool and very quick.  Behind him was a wall of business cards that kept my attention for the remainder of the dinner I did manage to eat.  My boyfriend had the all-you-can-eat sushi.  I had the beef and chicken teriyaki (as I do not eat anything that lives in the water except seaweed).  My meal came with miso soup and a small salad.  The miso soup was pretty tasty!  And the small salad very basic but had an excellent ginger dressing atop of it.  My entree looked really good when our waitress served it but, as I began to eat it, it was full of fat (both on the chicken and the beef).  I guess that would be okay if I liked gristle and fat but, I hate the chewy stuff--it makes me want to puke.  I probably ate 2% of my meal, not including the rice.  My boyfriend ate most of his rolls but later commented to me that he didn't think the ingredients were very fresh.  Overall, our chef was cool.  Our waitress was very sweet and attended to us very well.  I think the restaurant itself could use a good cleaning and remodeling whenever they get a chance, but hell, what do I know?"}
{"text":"All You can eat $24.95 per person for dinner.  And $22.95 for lunch.  This place is open late (until midnight) and came here at 945pm on a Tuesday night and it was dead. I think there were like 4 other people in the building and that was it. The service was slow and I didn't understand why because there wasn't anyone there at all.  I definitely have had much better sushi at other places and this place is just mediocre to me. Nothing really stood out. Yes they have plenty of specialty rolls to choose from, and I got to try most of their \"Top 10\" rolls, and I admit they were good, like the \"Fantasy Roll\" , it had cream cheese and eel sauce and avocado and shrimp on top of a spicy tuna roll.  Would I go back? sure, it wasn't bad nor was it memorable, it was just ok. I didn't like the fact that they charged for their desserts and they had a limit on the mochi. The good news: they serve 4 nigiri pieces per order.. when its usually 2 anywhere else."}
{"text":"Went to sushi factory on a whim since I was in the area. I went for the all u can eat for $24.95. First off I started with the yakisoba which was good but it had a pool of oil on the bottom, so stick to just eating the top part. The ahi poke was too sweet and vinegary. The tempura calamari was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The sushi rice was excellent. The fish less than perfect. Since they use a Lot of frozen fish. I can taste the co2 in the fish. It was pretty slow when I went only 8 people in the restaurant including myself. Overall pretty good. I didn't eat any rolls since I'm not a roll kind of guy. Hehe."}
{"text":"What happened to this place. Used to come here all the time. The sushi bar is closed, the ac seems to be out bc they're using floor fans. I came to try the $12.50 special ayce. There were 10 people waiting in front of us. The guy second in line said he waited 30 min but the line didn't seem like it would move anytime soon. I peeked in the dining room am there were about 5 unbussed tables."}
{"text":"Their Marchello roll is the shiznit i'm telling you! Oh and the Spider hand roll too.."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. Fish was fresh, good quality ingredients, and sauces on the rolls were really yummy. We will be coming back to explore more of the menu. Hopefully they get their liquor license soon to enjoy the libations with dinner."}
{"text":"I am so happy that I have a new all-you-can-eat restaurants close to the house and one that provides great service and great food. what really caught my attention it's the sushi rice. The rice is beautiful. There's no other way to say it. Their fish is great, the unagi is even better. And what I love is that their appetizer menu is more expensive than other places that we normally go to. I do believe we have found our new regular spot when were in the mood for sushi."}
{"text":"Great place! We had a great sever named Russ, very friendly, very fast, very kind! He said he was new but seemed quite fit for the job :) The quality of the fish here was also great  my girlfriend loved the Uni here, said it tasted actually real compared to other AYCE places."}
{"text":"It was ok. I didn't mind it. The ambience ok. Service was nice. Food cost reasonable & delicious."}
{"text":"Pretty standard sushi buffet. Rolls were good and there is a wide variety to choose from, as well as appetizers, nigiri, and hand rolls. Service was a little slow despite us being 1 of only 2 other parties in the whole place around 3 or 4pm on a Saturday. We still left full and happy though so can't complain too much."}
{"text":"DISAPPOINTED!  I saw the notifications on yelp saying that this place is \"Hot and New\".  So usually I always go to \"Sapporo Revolving Sushi\" on Spring Mountain and Decatur. But tonight we decided to check out this new place. But we got a horrible experience.  - The Nigiri wasn't fresh at all. (Which it gave me stomachache right after I got home) and you can tell it wasn't fresh when you tasted it.  - service was really really really slow. - the server forgot his \"SMILE\" at home.   I wish I could give this place 0 star. But the don't have that option. So i'll give it a 1.  And also not recommend at all.  I understand everyone has their one tastes. But trust me if you ever try \"Sapporo Sushi\" and you like it. Then this place is not YOUR TASTES."}
{"text":"Finally we have more options on ayce sushi on this side of town. They just open couple day ago.Great variety on the menu. Price is reasonable. Service is wonderful but maybe because we the only table in restaurant. For the food is good fish is fresh but the only complain that me and my wife agree is the rice should need more seasoning is just no favor. Overall is great!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting! Long story short they got my \"to go\" order wrong. I drove all the way back from Rio hotel in Vegas traffic to get the rest of my order Bc an employee Russ informed me they would take care of it plus take care of the whole bill. In this case that would have been the right thing to do. (Over an hour to get back and fourth) When I finally get there this arrogant manager tells me I'll give you a free roll....GtFO!  I've have never had a bad experience @ sushi anywhere. I gave them every opportunity to fix there mistake.   I truly hope NO one ever has that type of experience."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this place yet. It's my husband's favorite, so we come here often. If you're wondering why then that I only give it three stars; well, here's the thing: This was the best sushi place, when we first started coming here (I would say a year or so ago), but I've noticed a steady decline in service. Last night, our waitress took our order, then I think I spotted her twice in the restaurant the rest of the night. Some other waiters took turns serving us, but they did so sporadically and half the time forgot things. Our first order of sushi came out really quickly, but from then on,  the orders came so slow, we thought the waiter had forgotten to put in the last one and we were about to leave without having it (with all-you-can-eat, it wouldn't have affected our bill anyways). The sushi on the other hand, is still excellent! In fact, last night it was the owner himself making the sushi and it was mmm, mmm, good. :) They have great specials, which vary by day of the week, but I'm bored with their roll menu. It seems like too many rolls are repeated, only with a different fish or sauce on top. There could be more creativity/variety there."}
{"text":"Despite the long wait, this is one of the best sushi places in Las Vegas. The staff was very welcoming and food was just as great. Do not get fooled by the low reviews due to excessive wait times. Due to it being a grand opening day with such volume of customers, the wait time is understandable!!"}
{"text":"I've been here for the soft opening which wasn't a pleasure experience due to mass crowd however the food was gooood. I am here again today and I knew that my experience here at sushi factory will be awesome! Food is over the top no doubt about it. They will make rolls fresh every time when you order.  This is my new favorite sushi place to go to."}
{"text":"We loved it and were back twice more. Lots of variety and carefully crafted dishes. Always friendly and personable service."}
{"text":"It was so yummy that I didn't take pics besides this one  We were a little disgruntled because we had been told that the wait at the originally sushi place we went to was a whole hour (our fault for wanting sushi on a Saturday night lol). But, we are glad that happened because then we ran into this gem of a sushi place and had the best time. It's very cozy inside and set up nicely. We sat at the bar and our plates were stacked upon stacked without waiting very long. It was busy that night but we appreciated the servers and sushi chef communicating with us every step of the way how busy they were and when our order (drinks or food) were expected to arrive at our table. We found all of the sushi we had yummy and fresh and loved the customer service overall. Make sure to check them out!"}
{"text":"A brand new sushi restaurant for the southwest part of town and best of all it's AYCE.  It's a small place on Rainbow. The food is good but not spectacular. The service is attentive and good. The only problem was the speed at which the food was served. The wait staff said the kitchen was backed up and it showed. While our initial order came out within five or ten minutes it wasn't complete.  Subsequent orders took a long time or even forgotten. The restaurant was not too busy so we couldn't understand why the food came out so slowly.  We will attribute this to growing pains.  Overall a good experience but maybe with a few tweaks in the kitchen this could be a great place to come to."}
{"text":"Nice new Restuarant; sushi good. Smaller serving portions than expected. Lots of different sushi rolls then what I've seen at other AYCE restaurants. Service good and fast; could be due to smaller portions."}
{"text":"SH*TTIEST EFFING SERVICE EVER. Really??!?!?! Wassup with the waitress? She told us that they were out of everything, just because she didnt understand English. You think im joking? no. it was the real truth. Thank God they had the busboy help a little bit. Who confirmed that they indeed have all the stuff the waitress said they were out of.   I kept asking if they had oysters. \"OYSTERS?\" \"OYSTERS?\" THIS BROAD DIDNT KNOW WHAT OYSTERS WAS! I said to my friends, Uhm, how do you say Oysters in JAPANESE?!?!?!  She replied \"Im not Japanese\"  OKAY. YOU DONT SPEAK ENGLISH, YOU DONT SPEAK JAPANESE, how are you supposed to take our order? The logical thing to do would be to just point at the items u want in the menu right? WRONG!!!! Out of the maybe 10 items that was ordered from the AYCE, 2 came. it was horrible. OH by the way, our items came out, we still didnt have any silverware! We asked the same genius waitress for the plates, she nodded and said ok, yehhhhh i dont think she understood that either, coz she just went about her way balancing checks. BUSBOY to the rescue! worst part of it all.. they put the 18 percent gratuity in the check already. WHAT A JOKE. NEVER AGAIN. FIRE THIS GIRL. SHES RUINING YOUR BUSINESS."}
{"text":"So I came here that grand opening day. I really did not want to be the one to write this review. Many people said they waited a long time like 2 hours or so. I expected this. It's fine. I was not upset about the wait at all.   I only waited about an hour because I came at 4. I was expecting a wait and we had a party of 5. They were doing their bogo offer. My brother came Friday and I guess they weren't doing it anymore.   Their food was not actually that bad. Their salmon was good and the oysters too. The salmon tartar I think was also really good. Their amaebi was a tad bit off. It wasn't that great. The uni's color was off too. But the scallops and super white was not bad. The rolls were alright too. I forgot which rolls we ordered. We were hungry and the food was coming slow.   Don't get the tempura. Too much batter and it was soggy when it got to us.   So why was this an awful experience? It truthfully was not the wait, the staff, or much of the food. It was specifically OUR server. Why?  He kept pouring cold tea. He kept forgetting to get our miso soup. We probably asked 6 times. He kept saying that the cooks know. However, we sat right by the kitchen and it's your server that's supposed to get it for you from the soup pot!! It was ridiculous. This guy was out of it!! When I asked for his attention he says yes? Then literally looks at you and walks away...  When we asked the other servers passing us, we got all our stuff literally right away if not immediately not too long after. The girl server who was at the station closest to the restroom helped us. The minute we asked for the miso soup, she went and grabbed it. Bam done. When we asked for hot tea, the tea was actually HOT. She was great. Our assigned or designated server AWFUL. He plain just looked inexperienced. Either that or didn't care. I get it you're stressed cuz it's busy, but that's the food industry... the other servers never dropped the ball like that..."}
{"text":"They did a few things well, but sadly l got the impression the lunch sushi chefs were either not skilled or just are who they are. Poor presentation and something as simple as tuna nigiri was faulty. I've never seen tuna presented with white lines in it, the stuff you can't digest let alone try to chew. All you can eat menu had a huge glob of oily kim chee fried rice in a portion size to ruin your appetite because it was so large and not any kind of flavor treat or taste. Nice decor, lady server was efficient,  but they need to up their game. There is a sushi spot on nearly every corner in town and you have to compete with good food in other restaurants. My stomach felt heavy for several days after, not too good. I can't imagine a second visit in my future."}
{"text":"AYCE Sushi Joints have become so commonplace in Vegas that non-AYCE places are marketing their exclusivity.  Sushi Factory, spawned from the \"Sushi On\" folks who first hit Vegas with the most commonly-implemented concept, made-to-order AYCE (versus pre-made and laid out).  Every time we have some major physical labor (moving an office, hauling off trucks to auction, etc), we use it as an excuse to head over to Sushi Factory.  The appetizer/non-sushi selection is more than sufficient for your scaredycat friends who eat one california roll and one order of tuna.  The list of house special rolls is massive and largely descriptive (they do mix in a few \"trust me\"s.  Trust them.)  I have visited Sushi Factory around 15-20 times since moving to Vegas and have NEVER had a problem with the fish.  On a Sunday morning at 1AM it's still good.  If you're an AYCE nut, you can handle the rest, as long as the fish is good and the rice is at least decent (Theirs is sticky, not too moist or dense, and always good to the bite).   Speaking of 1AM, I love Sushi Factory for this most of all.  At 1AM, my friends visiting from the East Coast start quizzing me on what fast food joints are open this late and can they still order a pizza or something.  I ask what they really want, one says \"I REALLY want Sushi, but it's way too late\".  Sushi Factory helps me keep the Vegas cred high: \"Guys, you've really forgotten where you are.  You want Sushi at one in the morning, Vegas will make you Sushi at one in the morning!\"  Service used to be the \"decent\" you could expect from most AYCE sushi in town.  On our most recent vists, the service has shown signs of improving further.  We never had empty glasses (as common as it is cruel at AYCE), you always felt like multiple people were looking out for you (floor manager is now present regularly, likely facilitating these improvements), and the chefs themselves are a riot, keeping the conversation going between themselves and the guests without ever feeling forced.   I'm a big fan of Oyshi, but Sushi Factory is quickly taking over my #1 spot for AYCE Sushi in Vegas."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  1 they ended their BOGO reopening promotion deal last 3/21 (instead of 3/19- 3/23) due to excessive guest. DUH!  2 ORDER TOOK FORVER 3 SLOW SLOW SERVICE 4  VERY FEW SELECTIONS."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! We're not usually all-you-can-eat fans of anything, but their all-you-can-eat sushi is a must. There are so many different types of sushi and rolls to choose from as well as other non-sushi fare. We always sit at the sushi bar which adds to the experience. If you're in the mood to try a variety of food this place is definitely the place to go!  Note: You can always ask for a half order of a roll so that you don't get full off just one or two if you want to try a good variety."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, they don't have their beer and wine license, but Monkey brain is on point."}
{"text":"One of the best small sushi restaurants I've been to in Las Vegas.  Wanna know why?  The food was freshly made and has lots of flavor!  Every dish was neatly put together and had their own unique taste.  So many cool names of their dishes (you'll see what I mean) LOL.  The staff is very helpful, polite and always made sure we got our food in a timely manner.  If you're looking to just get a quick bite, or splurge with your friends, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"First time here, great deal for all you can eat @lunch. They also have a stamp card, but 10 get 1 AYCE free. Will be back!"}
{"text":"the fish was great but the rice wasnt washed, im a rice nerd. but overall service was great and food for the most part was great. the miso soup reminds me of japan, cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"It's all you can eat....it's not amazing sushi, but for the price not bad. Don't come expecting anything more. Sushi was alright, a couple of pieces were close to frozen :-( . I was with friends and they all thought for what we got and price, it was worth three stars. The service was good! If you want high end sushi consider another sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"What a treat! Saw the all you can eat sushi menu deal and had to try it! Was eating alone to take a break from a rough murphys law type family vacation while family watched the kids in the same shopping center at LOL kids club. The sushi chef was a great guy with a good sense of humor, good conversation but didn't talk too much to where it would bother. Sushi and food was GREAT, recommend!"}
{"text":"Won't coming back. My husband order sake bomb and got it with \"hot\" sake!! Miso soup was super salty, tuna tartare was unseasoned. I would give 5 stars just for the service."}
{"text":"After yesterday, when we came to a business door saying they wouldn't take anymore customers in, we were pretty upset but we decided to give it another try. We wrote our name down on the wait list at 4pm, and didn't get seated til 5:45 pm today. We didn't really mind waiting tho cause we went shopping at the arroyo. As we got seated, our waiter, Russ, quickly got everything set up for us quickly. Water, took our order, all in 5 minutes. I also tend to drink a lot of miso, but he kept getting it for me which was pretty nice. He said he's new but he seemed much more organized than the other servers that were there tbh. Also, the fish really fresh, it's like you can taste the fish just melting in your mouth. The uni-SUPER GOOD. I loved it. We'lol definitely be back and I hope for the success of this place."}
{"text":"So i hopped on the $21.95 all you can eat Lunch with my best friends and some homies .. we came up to Vegas for my best friend's birthday and we all agreed that a Japanese Buffet would hit the spot ..   I was happy with the sushi, but disappointed in the tempura .. i like my tempura CRISPY, not SOGGY. But the taste of it was still koo .. i picked at some chicken teriyaki from my homie's plate and i couldn't complain cuz the chicken was tender ... from the sushi menu i ordered the \"Joe the Man\", the \"Bank Roll\", the \"Spider Roll\" and we hopped on some Yellowtail (Hamachi) Sashimi .. all well deserving of 4 stars .. but yeah, the rating went down to 3 stars cuz of the tempura ..   I also ordered the Gyoza, which was fried and not oily and also not skimpy (some places don't have too much meat in their gyoza or it's greasy) .. i also got some edamame. The veggie tempura i ordered  .... well .. i was disappointed from the selection .. potato, yam, and eggplant. I was looking for a broccoli .. a carrot .. maybe a string bean .. but i got the boring ones .. i'm assuming cuz it was part of the all-you-can-eat sushi menu, so they gave us the veggies not too many people look for? lol .. i dunno .. the special plate for $7.95 had a california roll, shrimp/veggie tempura and another entree of your choice. It came on a big plate and wasn't bad at all for $8. i'd cop that if i wasn't in the mood for sushi (but that's rare..) .. .the dressing on the salad is kinda odd for me, but my best friend told me it was a ginger vinaigrette and that explained everything (i'm not fond of ginger..) ..   one thing i did like was that they'll customize orders with no complaints .. a fried Philly Crunch roll tastes better than the regular Philly Crunch roll .. and im allergic to Avocado, so i'm glad they kept it outta my sushi =) they also paid attention to us, making sure we didn't need anything else and constantly refilled the water (w/ lemon, that was a plus for me) ..   I'd come back here again, but only for the sushi ... i could do without the combo plates ..."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here for the 12.50 special.  The experience was okay. It was so stinking hot in there. I don't think their centralized air-conditioning was working so they had to use this generator in the back. There was a wait when we arrived, but there was a lot of empty tables. I think they were very short staffed because service was very slow. We didn't complain because sushi was only 12.50, so when they did come around, we ordered a bunch of sushi. This helped with the slow service. The food was okay. I've had better sushi and definitely fresher fish. The decoration was weird. It looked like a Mexican restaurant. I don't think i would come back here if it was full price."}
{"text":"Good quality fish! Taste really fresh. The server also pretty nice and fast serving. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"If you like sushi this is the place to be. They have great service, delicious food, really fresh seafood. The restaurant is super clean. Everyone is so nice... and let's not forget how amazing Melissa was!!!  also, desserts are yummy"}
{"text":"No wait. Empty around 830pm on a Monday. Hot foods were excellent and the sushi/sashimi was fresh, unexpected for how empty it was. Overall had a good time. Would go again instead of waiting in line at some other sushi joints."}
{"text":"everything that we try was prety good, volcano, fatt ass roll, screaming O, sashimi salad, something wrong, sashimi salad, baked green mussel. I suggest to get the Eat all you can. the portions are small enough that you can try a lot of stuff."}
{"text":"Good sushi and good service! We went around 4:30 and so it wasnt so busy. We received our sushi pretty fast. Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"All the food was amazing and the service was great. Will definitely be back soon.  All the sushi tased really fresh and anything with the garlic sauce was on point."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever given a 5 star review but this place sure deserves one! I grew up in Vegas and have been to SO many sushi restaurants; I'm a little hesitant to say this, but I really think it might be the BEST sushi in town. Such great service too. So friendly, warm and welcoming. Very happy right now. I've only eaten here twice, I sure hope nothing changes. Amazing place. Excellent music too!!! And the honey bread  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Amazing quality, ambience, and value!  Highly recommend coming for the all you can eat dinner!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. went here 2 times and the first time was delicious , the second time was okay. I think it's only because it was a different sushi chef that worked there the second time we went. either way it was good. I would recommend though that the salmon nigiri needs to be cut a little thinner , and then it would be perfect. overall I'm going to start coming here more often , its close , and good. my favorite is the golden philly :)"}
{"text":"It's not SushiMon but, it's pretty darn good sushi =)  Portions are pretty big...then, again, I would hope so for the price you pay. Rolls are, generally, over $10.   Seems like lots of locals go there because business cards are, practically, taped to the whole sushi bar wall.  The neighborhood isn't so great cuz the adult superstore is near by --- but, heyyyy, I'm not gonna judge! After some sushi, maybe, you want some tuna? Who knows!!!  I had a bunch of stuff. Forgot most of the names/nicknames. But, the MUST samps of the place that I do remember the name of is the CAJUN ALBACORE!!!!! Yummy..it's seared on the outside with cajun seasoning."}
{"text":"Ahhh the Sushi Factory.  I've been here a few times and it's okay.  On every occasion I've always ate AYCE sushi so I have no comment on the actual dinner dishes.  BUT this is a sushi factory so that's what I should be eating right?  The rolls here are pretty standard and nothing really stood out for me.  I enjoyed a few of the baked rolls but they were pretty saucy and I'm not too much of a saucy sushi kind of guy.  Sit at the bar here if you are doing the AYCE because they are much much much faster there than if you were sitting at a booth or table.  Hopefully they get a little more creative with the rolls and maybe I'll come back to eat here again.  Hit me up when you got new rolls guys.. I'll be waiting."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since opening night. They had a 2 for 1 special so it was obviously busy, and obviously service was a bit slower than normal. However the food was great, and the entire staff was friendly. I've continued to come back and have yet to be disappointed. No alcohol yet, but their liquor license is coming! Definitely a new go to for sushi"}
{"text":"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I kind of liked this place.  The price of the buffet was very affordable.   Yes, there are limits on specific items but I have seen that at other buffet places.  The service was adequate when I was there.  Overall the food was good and I enjoyed my meal.   I would return."}
{"text":"BEST sushi for your buck anywhere, everything is fresh, they have amazing rolls, and the sometimes the service is excellent they usually lag a bit, but if you get the right server he'll help you out with whatever you need on the menu, it s a vegas tradition for me to go here everytime i go to vegas."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time yesterday. We all got all you can eat. The sushi came out fast and it was delicious! The staff was friendly and attentive. We loved it! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The owner is a Korean chef. He is a very nice guy. He recommends daily fresh special for the customers. Very enjoyable dinning experience over there."}
{"text":"Strictly in regards to food, this is a solid sushi AYCE. Great selection of sushi rolls and nigiri, all fresh. Honey Bread for dessert is amazing. The 2 for 1 deal for opening week makes it absolutely worth.  The wait to be seated is super long because it's the grand opening and the staff is overwhelmed. Expect it to be really busy for the rest of the week 3/19 - 3/23."}
{"text":"Seldom all you can eat sushi restaurants offer a balance amount of choices between raw and cooked dishes. Sushi factory is an exceptional  it gives you a selection of hot dishes with quality including mini udon and crispy rice balls. Dessert comes with surprises too.  Cheers  A paid customer"}
{"text":"This place is really nice, the staff is incredibly helpful and attentive, the rolls are delicious but huge."}
{"text":"I've had AYCE dinner here twice and I love how there was no long wait to get seated. They have delicious food & fast/friendly staff! Fish:Rice ratio is perfect for nigiri & rolls, plenty of appetizers to choose from, and bonus - they do half order for rolls! Make sure to ask for a stamp card before you leave. I highly recommend giving this restaurant a try!"}
{"text":"Newest AYCE sushi location in the southwest area! On rainbow and warmsprings, right next to cheeburgercheeburger. They had a grand opening special, 2 for 1 AYCE which is crazy so obviously had to make a stop. Space is a little small, so prepare for a wait. The fish quality was great! Selection of rolls were great, even dividing it up for soft shell crab roll selections, rolls which incorporate shrimp tempura, and even rolls with no rice! (Get the johnny roll) so good! Had a great app selection as well. Given that it was a crazy deal and it's a new opening, service was a little slow but looks like my fellow yelpers had similar thought on their service, so I'm sure it'll improve! Food quality was good though. Fresh, good rice portion"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Sushi Factory because I am a fan of AYCE sushi, but sadly, I did not like this place and will probably never go back here. Went with my BF and his Aunt and Uncle.  The four of us have been having sushi together pretty regularly for several months now, as the Aunt & Uncle have just discovered their love of sushi.  We decided to venture outside of our normal stomping ground, I Love Sushi, and check out Sushi Factory.    We tried Edamame beans (good), Miso soup (really salty), they had salads which were apparently good as well.  We tried a variety of rolls and don't really remember most of them.  Mainly because they were not very flavorful.  The fish was fresh but we tend to go for the spicier sushi rolls and even the ones which were supposed to be spicy were not spicy enough.  The last roll we ordered and our favorite was Spicy Christmas Roll.  This was the only roll that had enough hotness for us.    On top of the fact that we didn't care for the sushi, the atmosphere was not great.  It was like eating sushi in someone's garage, not decorated at all and awkwardly set up.  The staff was really friendly but the mediocre sushi coupled with the surroundings had us all longing for I Love Sushi."}
{"text":"Sunday night, party of 8 with 3 kids included, and they take reservations..excellent..  Factory Service: The fact they take reservations is such a win as it's not as common as it should be.   Our server sat us in the biggest booth area to the left which sat 8 easily and can set around 10+ easily.  The sushi chefs get your sushi and non-sushi orders to the table under 10 minutes upon ordering.  They brought a full pot of tea for the tea drinkers and I never had to ask for a refill on my soft drink. Excellent  Factory Sushi:  Solid nigiri performance, here are my notables: If you dig garlic, hit up that garlic tuna. It's tasty here with a very strong garlic flavor.  You only get one order of the salmon belly but it's flavorful.  The surf clam and sea urchin is fresh.  The dragon roll was the lone roll I ordered and would order again. Mushroom lovers, try the monkey brain: Tempura mushroom, soft shell crab inside topped with a tasty mayo sauce.  Factory Ambiance:  I love the cherry blossom inspired tree that greets you upon entrance.  Japanese sushi house inspired decor with dark wood throughout the dining area makes for a nice dining experience.  There's a sushi bar for single diners and booths are efficiently placed to seat the maximum amount of patrons.  Sushi Factory is another great AYCE sushi option on the southwest side of town.  I enjoyed the non-sushi dishes I sampled and I'm looking forward to trying more, but that's another yelp tale.  Enjoy! =)"}
{"text":"The best all you can eat sushi in Las Vegas. I prefer the location in Henderson. The thing that make this place great is that you can get EVERYTHING on the menu in the all you can eat. And there's no time limit!"}
{"text":"Read the following as a 3.5 star rating which I've only rounded up to counteract some ire by other reviewers who aren't as forgiving for factors that are clearly the result of running a special promotion.  Sushi Factory is a new all-you-can-eat (AYCE) sushi restaurant on Rainbow Blvd just south of the plaza which everybody knows is the home of the first Brew Tea Bar. A server mentioned that it's the sister restaurant of Sushi Way, which seems to have found success over on Paradise Rd (I've yet to go there myself), and they did seem better prepared than another AYCE sushi restaurant did with a grand opening promo. Parking wasn't crazy when I got there, and it shouldn't be too bad unless the neighboring Grand Sign Kitchen suddenly closes and reopens as something incredibly popular.  That promo, publicly posted at their restaurant and on social media, was a 2-for-1 deal. I'm not sure if lunch pricing was offered (regularly $21.95 pre-3pm), but we managed to get in for dinner (regularly $25.95, after 3pm). Yes, it drew lots of customers - so much so that they cut the promo short from 5 to 3 days. Fortunately, i was able to get in on the new last day. Unfortunately, I had to wait just shy of 2 hours to be seated. Fortunately, again, that means that I was really hungry when it was time to get down to business.  AYCE sushi places rarely dish out fish of excellent quality, but most places in Las Vegas do a pretty good job. I generally had okay fish on my nigiri here, but nothing really great, much less surprisingly wonderful. The salmon was the most delicious, while everything else was on the bland side. To be fair, I didn't plumb the depths of the nigiri menu, so maybe I missed something good. Do note that the fresh scallop was surprisingly OK despite being bay scallop (the smaller kind) instead of sea scallop. The rice was a bit sketchy, with some dry grains here and there and not all that much vinegary flavor.  There were a few standouts. The spicy tuna tartare was a fun layered dish: a little avocado sandwiched between thick layers of spicy tuna and the imitation crabstuffs of California rolls, and all of it obviously composed in a ring mold. The coconut shrimp tempura was a fun variant which I've never seen on another AYCE sushi menu (I just checked Sushi Way's menu; it's there too, of course), and the sweet coconut was a welcome change. The baked green mussels weren't overly mayo'd up and actually had a gooey cheese topping. The Barbie Special was a great riceless roll, with cucumber and crunchy batter from the calamari tempura working textural wonders.  The one item which I'd outright skip next time is the sashimi salad. The diced salmon was good, but the tuna and other fish used were inferior, mushy bits. I would also take caution with the uni, but although the color was disturbingly tinged with black, the flavor was actually muted. Low brininess and an absence of anything off-putting are actually not the bottom of the barrel for AYCE-quality uni.  By the way, I also have this thing about really enjoying multiple desserts after my meal, and that's simply not an option here. Also, they only had ice cream available today. It was relatively solid, with creamy texture and decent vanilla flavor (the green tea flavor was a bit light though).  Considering my meal overall, I don't have much of a reason to drive over halfway across town to Sushi Factory just for AYCE sushi. I'm also as likely just to check out Sushi Way first. Check this place out if you're in the neighborhood though, or if you've tried everything else and want a change. I do have to wonder if they'll capture enough fans with an established AYCE sushi spot just a block away and another one up Rainbow past 215. Time will tell."}
{"text":"I rarely give a place 5 stars, but they deserve it! was our second trip tonight and still loving it! first trip we sat at the sushi bar. very friendly and knowledgeable chefs!  screaming O and sashimi salad are awesome! lettuce wrap was also good. every type of nigiri was delicious and fresh. we did a few half rolls on the first trip (forgot the names), but they were also very good and well made. they do offer soy paper (my wife doesn't like seaweed) and have 5 no rice rolls. dynamite was really good, but too many mushrooms for my taste; my wife loved it though. the light smokey flavor on the pork belly is excellent! we also had most of the skewers. the best were bacon wrapped asparagus and bacon wrapped scallops. hard to wrong with anything bacon wrapped though! only negatives are the slightly limited deserts and they still don't have their liquor license. good selection of beers and sake though. finally, they do have a buy 10 get 1 free punch card!"}
{"text":"I have heard great reviews about Sushi Factory, and after my visit, I'm not sure if I went to the right place? Right when we walked in we were hit with a bad fish smell that lingered the entire time we were there. We ended up getting the all you can eat option and that was OK. I didn't think the sushi had much flavor, if it wasn't a spicy roll, it tasted bland and if it was a spicy roll, all you could taste was spice. The service wasn't too great either. It wasn't even busy when we went and we might have saw our server a total of 3 times. This is one place I can say that I will not give another chance to and go back, there are plenty other sushi places that offer all you can eat. I have definitely had better sushi else where."}
{"text":"WORTH THE WAIT !! I know its kinda long wait but hey ! I just wanna tell everyone  it is WORTH IT ..  you can just put your name on the wait list and they will text you 10 mins ahead ..   So food was great fresh and tasty   Must try items  ***   Tuna cuppacio ,  yellowtail with jalapeño , coconut shrimp , tako wasabi ,big easy roll  and sex bomb roll  Service was good ,  server kept checking on us amd  its average wait time for a busy restaurant ( specially they have a promotion 2for 1 going on )"}
{"text":"Great selection I love the freshness and lunch is a great deal. Fish was fresh and the deep fried sushi was the bomb... try the go rebel"}
{"text":"Few days ago I tried this with my husband and we both fell in love with it.. the sushi was on point and very flavorful. Now I'm back with my little brother and best friend and the place is amazing. The lay out of the restaurant reminds me of Japan. When I was here with my husband I had the Bento box sushi dinner. For the price of it I got full right away.. not to much and not to little.. prefect amount. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is my newest favorite sushi spot in Vegas! It is rather new, but the wait staff and chefs are super friendly and personable! As time goes on, I'm noticing that places that have friendly and upbeat staff make for such a better experience! But don't get me wrong, the quality is amazing as well! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"this is my favorite sushi restaurant in las vegas. i cant even count how many times ive been here. i love the traci roll!"}
{"text":"The place is out dated, but who cares they have great friendly service. HUGE all you can eat menu!. Come hungry!. Would differently come back when I come visit again.  The sushi is really delicious!!."}
{"text":"this is our first time to check out the place.service is excellent,bathroom is clean and the food was awesome.the susie chefs were friendly too.we look forward to eating there again."}
{"text":"i don't know why but we always end up here when we go in big groups to vegas. i guess cuz in a big group, no one can decide where to go and AYCE sushi is easy. it's not the best or freshest( it's sushi in the desert!) but for 25 bucks, they have a pretty good variety of creative rolls, and you can order non sushi items like tempura, hamachi-kama, oysters. i usually judge a place like this on their salmon. here- it's a hit or miss. sometimes it's pretty good, sometimes, it's bleh. bad salmon is the worst!"}
{"text":"holy ball sauce! this place was absolutely terrible! there was literally no hostess at the front so, regardless of the \"wait to be seated\" sign we had to seat ourselves.   didn't see a server for about 10 minutes and when we finally did, she was so upset by the fact that half of us ordered waters that she decided not to bring them. awful.  when it finally came time to order food (about a half an hour later) they forget 70% of our orders, appetizers and entrees. we had to reorder about 5 of the dishes and didn't get them until about 45 minutes later. they came in completely random order and some of us didn't get our food until after everyone else was finished. the prices weren't even that great and neither was the food.  i could honestly go on and on with more awful things about this place but it would literally take me all day. please do yourself a favor and drive a mile down the road to a better sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"sushi factory is delicious.  my faves cherry blossom, shrimp lover roll, brooklyn bridge roll. good place to hang out and enjoy the food. ample parking. service a little slow coz only 1 server for entire resto."}
{"text":"Drive past this place several times and had to search it. After seeing how nice it looked and more importantly the lovely pics of the sushi the lady and I had to come. So far it's been great!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went during their grand opening. We understood there would be a wait due to the 2 for 1 all you can eat. For how busy it was we got in after waiting about an hour.  The employees were all very kind even for being super slammed. We live in North Las Vegas and will definitely make the drive to come back.  1 of the best sushi places we've been to in Vegas."}
{"text":"Its kind of hard to be a bad all-you-can-eat sushi joint in this town -- in any town, maybe. There's a basic formula you follow. As long as you plug in the right variables, you're golden.   As far as menu is concerned, Sushi Factory was pretty spot on. We went for lunch so there was a few things they didn't offer for their lunch menu, like otoro. But then they didn't offer hirame (halibut) at all. That was the very first indiscretion.   The only thing that pissed me off after that was the service. I understand that sushi chefs traditionally have a shogun (aloof) attitude, but these sushi dudes had straight up bad bedside manner. They were slow and forgot orders. Our waitress was polite, but she never refiled my green tea.   I suppose we were the forgotten ones because we were the first to sit at the sushi bar, while all other guests sat at tables. The sushi bar is isolated from the rest of the dining area, which I would think makes for bad restaurant feng shui. It just doesn't seem like good flow to have to traverse the restaurant with hands full of food like that.   I already have a bread a butter all-you-can-eat sushi place. I shall never return to Sushi Fucktory."}
{"text":"Your future favorite sushi spot.   So you walk into this hole in the wall and the first thing to note is the friendly staff. Head to the bar and based off your first orders the chef gets to know your taste and will recommend new dishes. The quality of the presentation is just as captivating as the taste.   Side note, I would like to mention that on my way out of the plaza a staff member literally came running out with my bag.  A smile on his face he wished me a great day.   Sushi Factory is exceptional."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is chill & staff are real koo. Food is on point & delicious. Parking lot was clean & big haha"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this new little AYCE sushi spot.  Nice and clean inside the restaurant.  Service was as friendly as I've ever encountered in an Asian restaurant.  The fish tasted very fresh, and was skillfully prepared.  Definitely my favorite neighborhood sushi spot in SW Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband and son for the 2 for 1 grand opening special during lunch.  Staff was a lot more attentive than expected for a grand opening.  Food came out fairly quickly and we were pleased with the size of the servings (not huge portions so we were able to order more without getting full as quickly).  Will come back during dinner (as some items are only available during dinner and after the grand opening special)."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm swimming upstream here. If you have a big appetite and your sushi bill is normally around a bill for one person, I'd suggest checking this place out. Yeah it's in a strip mall and the fish isn't what you'd expect at Nobu but the sushi is great quality for all you can eat. Plus you can order 1/2 rolls and they have around 30 to choose from. All the Nigiri, yes there's a limit on ama ebi and uni but how the frick do you expect a place to stay in business and make a living, give me a frickin break, these reviewers are out of their gawdamm mind. You can also eat as many fresh oysters as you like, that's a deal in itself.   My friend and I ordered the sashimi/tempura meal and it was served with 2 shrimp tempura, 2 eggplant, 1 sweet potato, 1 broccoli, and 1 onion. 8 pieces of sashimi, a cut california roll, miso soup, rice and salad for $13.50. What a deal. My other 2 friends had the all you can eat and they loved it. $80 for 4 including all the free ice tea refills. Definitely a deal in my book.   Yes I'm a fan. 4 well deserved stars."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch since they opened and I have to say it's pretty good for a Japanese spot in the neighborhood. We ordered the chicken teriyaki and tempura lunch specials and both were good with good portion sizes, only thing is that their lunch specials don't come with any rice, but they do give you 4 pieces of California roll. Our server Emmie was very friendly and attentive! Will definitely be back to try the all you can eat sushi. Definitely a must try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times, trying different items. sukiyaki beef bowl was mostly fat, some of the sushi is fine, salad is great, soup is good too. any of the meat dishes I've had was hardly meat, it had chewy fat =/"}
{"text":"Went there for their sushi 2 for 1 grand opening special. I see a lot of reviews complaining about the wait time, hmmm, you have a 2 for 1 deal going on a soft opening night, everyone is there for basically the same reason to pig out on cheap sushi. The restaurant is not that big... do the math people lol. I went with the full expectation that wait time was going to be super long...   Around 5:30 my friends and I put our name down. The good thing is that they actually take your phone number and let you walk away instead of making you wait there. So I was able to go back home, meet everyone at my house, watch a movie until they called. It was a 2 hour wait.   Then we were seated, you can tell the wait staff was trying but they are either freaked out by the crowd or are just inexperienced... It was just not working out. Our table was touched 4-5 times within the first 15 minutes of being there. However, throughout the duration of the meal orders were wrong multiple times. We got some nigiri from another table's order. Our uni and Amaebi never came, and when asked the female server said they are \"peeling the shrimp first order first served\" but never got it until we lost all hopes. Some other things didn't show up either... we kind of just assumed it went to a different table too.  Well here's a generous 3 star compare to the 1 my friends sent. If I stop by again then hopefully it'll increase!"}
{"text":"The nigiri tastes great.. they don't give a ton of rice  The rolls are pretty big in size with generous amount of fish  Would come back again"}
{"text":"The food was great, the service was wonderful, and the restaurant was very welcoming and clean."}
{"text":"I love this place!! They have a huge selection of sushi to choose from. They also have oysters & sashimi salad! Their 2 or 3 choice combos are the best as well. You can choosefrom a variety of food. The best part is that their servings are a great amount. I most especially love their shrimp tempura. Its perfect crisp and breaded the way I like it. Their prices are very decent and the food is good. Its well worth the money you spend. My family & friends eat at Sushi Factory at least twice a month. The only down side about this place is that the customer service isn't that great at times because of being short staffed but there staff is always friendly. I definitely recommend this place to everyone so they can bring their families and friends because of the awesome vibe fit for anyone to enjoy all the good food and fun!"}
{"text":"My New #1 sushi place. Everything was DELICIOUS! They have the big sweet shrimp not those tiny shrimp. The Uni was DELICIOUS & fresh. Been here 3x now."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was because I had to, everywhere I went had a really long wait and I was starving so I saw this sushi spot and decided to check it out. Wonder there was no wait, the place isn't much to brag about.   Nigiri: 0/5 I hate when I go places and they give me a chunk of rice and a super thin slice of fish. The portions are so off here, the reason why sushi restaurants pack on the rice is to clearly fill you up so you don't get to fully use their all you can eat. Also the fish here isn't very fresh, I might even say dry at times.   Rolls: 2/5  I usually don't order rolls but my boyfriend does, they have a pretty good amount of variety on their menu but nothing really screams \"OMG I have to try this\" and once again they packed their rolls with a lot of rice. Also I think they make the rice way way before hand so when we ended up getting our sushi roll order the rice was dry and crunchy huge turn off.  Value: 0/5 Honestly for $25 All you can eat you mind as well go some where else. This place isn't worth it. There are so many equal priced or even a bit less all you can eat sushi joints in Vegas you can go to.   Service: 5/5 The service here is pretty good well when I went it was and I went pretty late and it was kind of dead only 2 other tables other than my table BUT our server was really nice."}
{"text":"I always feel kind of bad giving a one or two star review. I did like Sushi Factory's sushi, but there was something about the place that I can't exactly put my finger on that just will not let me give it over a two star rating. Okay, let's go with 2.5.   When I arrived I was greeted by a very friendly hostess and seated quickly. Can I comment on the decor? I don't know, just looked a little ram-shackle to me. Ok ok... I'm not trying to be nit-picky, after all I do eat at plenty \"dumpy\" kind of joints because their food is AWESOME. But somehow dumpy + place that is serving me raw fish = me weirded out a bit.  I did the AYCE with my date. He was all hype about liking sushi though, he wouldn't even touch the sashimi I ordered, but instead insisted on all the fried little concoctions. One of our rolls completely fell apart when we tried eating it. Date didn't seem to care, but I was a little peeved.  Thank goodness they brought me out sake to begin with. I think this soothed the bad experience.   Don't get me wrong, it's a decent little place, I just don't think I'll be going back considering there are much better places in the valley to get AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"Friends and I all skipped dinner the night prior (mostly for good reasons) so the following morning AYCE anything sounded just about right.  My buddy recommended this spot and raved about how their Cajun Sushi and Soft Shell Crab were to die for.  Heck, we were starving so we saved time and made the call instantly..  We arrived at noon and it was empty, which was good because we were starving.. Just make sure to get the AYCE deal because otherwise, you'd be a fool to hate to lose out on their large selection of sushi rolls, hand rolls, sushi, sides, and appetizers available.  Of all the rolls we ordered (too many to remember), my favorite was the Tiger Roll.  The cajun sushi really was as good as my friend said it would be.  Beware of the Soft Shell Crab roll because it is a large serving (I recommend ordering just one of these to make room for other selections).  Overall, the quality of the sushi was ok but definitely worth the money paid.  Not sure how it is when busy but I'm lucky we didn't have to wait in line or anything."}
{"text":"We came opening day for the Facebook event... We saw there's a yelp review reward for a free soda, so a couple of us ordered some sodas after asking. They took the order but didn't tell us until after delivering the drinks that the reward is one per table. This 100% should have been mentioned before adding an additional drink to the tab. A huge order of unagi came out cold and chewy... The yellowtail was good, as was the salmon. It took 2 hrs to deliver about 2/3s of the food, and we cancelled the rest bc we didn't have another hour to spend. Two plates came out with quantities switched...  Ordered dessert with the check, 3 of the 4 desserts came, and we skipped the last two just to pay and get out. This took WAY TOO LONG with less than 50% order accuracy at the end of the meal. This was opening day and they were slammed from the BOGO special, so I'll reserve the right to change the stars under regular circumstances... if I come back."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE!! Not exaggerating, I've never waited so long for food in my life..  (&STILL DIDN'T GET ANY FOOD!!)  I would rate the food, but I never got to it with their slow service! They had an NFL promotion going on and with any promotion, they should be well staffed.. especially on the last day of the promotion during dinner time! Well they had 2 chefs last night. ARE YOU KIDDING ME, last day of an AYCE $12.50 promotion during dinner time and you have two chefs working? AYCE sushi during dinner always have more than 2 chefs, promotion or not. (AND THEY DIDNT EVEN HAVE TV's. NFL PROMOTION WITH NO NFL?)  So I called in and asked how long the wait would be for a table of 9, he said about 40 mins.   1) When I walked in, there wasn't even a host stand. I had to stand in the walk way (in an unorganized manner bc some people are just standing around waiting) and eventually a waiter walked up and asked random people if they have been put on a list.  2) The hosts waiting list was on little sheets of loose leaf paper. No not a notebook or even one large sheet of paper, it was a couple pieces of loose leaf paper! As he scrambled through them to tell anxious customers how far along they were on the waiting list, I know he messed up the order of the list. THERE WAS NO ORGANIZATION, just a couple pieces of paper with your name scribbled on it. No number on it, it didn't have any order besides the organization of the space between each of his fingers.  3) He said my wait was about an hour, I figured it was fine to wait. It's cheap, my whole family was there already (including my parents that we had to beg to come out since they don't like to eat out- POOR THEM FOR THIS BAD EXPERIENCE. Now they definitely won't go out for sushi ever again), and others that came before me were leaving, so I figured it wouldn't take an hour.   4) OVER AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER, he apologized and said we are next.. but they are just waiting for one of the big tables to leave (they only had three). We asked if we could be seated separately but he said the chefs can't handle another set of large orders, that's why we have to wait for a big table. Surprised, I just let it go. He then sat others that came in after us.. more than one table. WAIT doesn't 1+1=2?! HELLO THE ORDER OF TWO SMALL TABLES WOULD EQUAL TO ONE LARGE TABLE IDIOT!!!!  After experiencing that, we decided it would be best to leave because if we ever got seated, it would about another two hours until we got all of our food. At that point my parents had enough and just went back home with an empty stomach (across town 40 mins away!) The rest of us decided to go up the street to Buffet Asia (our waiter was so sweet we tipped her extra and she was extra kind about that as well). At that moment I realized I rather receive great service with okay food than bad service with any food.  5) That was the cheapest looking sushi place I have ever been to. Ugly wall colors and decor. Cheap cheap cheap tables and chairs.. just like what you would expect from a vietnamese restaurant, except sometimes vietnamese restaurants use table cloths!  If I knew that was how it was gonna go down, I wouldn't even have tried- totally not worth the $12.50 or even if it was cheaper!!  I hardly ever post on here, I know sometimes people/places have \"bad days\" but this was BADBADBAD that I would hate for anyone else to experience what we went though last night."}
{"text":"A 2 for 1 AYCE sushi special sounds like a really good deal on paper, but for a business just opening, it may backfire on them if they aren't prepared for the onslaught. Servers and cooking staff can feel overwhelmed, the food has to have a decent first impression, and people can end up waiting hours on end for their food. It's a bad combination and I noticed that this new place is taking the heat just because of that. My girlfriend and I were lucky enough to experience an almost normal meal considering all these factors.   We came in around 3:00PM, and by using visual clues, we figured we had to fill out a sign-in sheet and give them my number. Ended up waiting for only about an hour.   As soon as we got a text from the restaurant, we were immediately seated. I was impressed by the promptness and the decor. We were soon able to put in our orders and away we went on our late lunch.   10 minutes later, our food has yet to arrive. Concerned, one of the servers came up to us to check if we were waiting for our order. We confirmed that, and in a few minutes our first batch of orders came pouring in. Unfortunately, we did have to wait 10+ minutes each time we ordered anything new. We didn't really mind it since we understood how busy the were.  Long story short, the nigiri was decent. The salmon was the best part of the meal. You can't really go wrong with the rolls. The Golden Philly was the best. The other rolls we had tasted pretty standard, but don't get the no rice rolls. We specifically got the Rock'n'Roll and it was just an almost flavorless dish, doused in a huge amount of spicy sauce.   All in all, it was a pretty decent experience. For a 2 for 1 AYCE deal, it was better than expected. The servers did their best in accommodating every table, even if almost every server came up to us asking if we ordered anything. I'm sure they were just flustered by the neverending crowd of hungry people. If they're able to keep up the food quality and they improve on the logistics on service, I'm sure they'll be a sushi spot people will want to go back to."}
{"text":"Best in the Southwest location.. Well worth the wait and everything was delicious..so glad that this is sushi way sister location ..now we need 5 more locations. Only reason this place is missing a star is they kept forgetting our food yet it is still crowded in this small place for Grand Opening.  Today is the last day 3/21/2018 for the 2 for 1 A.Y.C.E price...even though the ads said 3/23/2018. I really enjoyed everything here. Check back on a couple months to make sure it consistant."}
{"text":"Love this place! Alex is awesome love sitting at the bar(I don't normally do that anywhere) he is always attentive and efficient. He checks on me to make sure I'm ok and I don't have to ask for my sirracha he already knows!"}
{"text":"This is on a little strip mall on Jones and Tropicana.  I LOVE sushi so my brother took me there.  It was all you can eat lunch or dinner.  Lunch is less but you don't get the uni or sweet shrimp like you get at the dinner all you can eat.  The two above are limited one per person but worth it.  Make sure you ask them to cook the head, it comes out with a tempura batter but is really crispy and sweet - superb.  The fish is fresh and sweet with no fish odor.  There is a ton or assorted roles.  They even have a few not on the menu, just ask.  They also have fresh oysters to die for.  There are other Sushi Factory around the Las Vegas area but this is the only one I have been to."}
{"text":"Very fresh and delicious sushi. Lots of appetizers to choose from. The tuna tar tar and the screaming orgasm were"}
{"text":"Try this AYCE place very nice quite place very friendly staff Bar Sushi Chief Tony and server Amy, Vanessa very polite good place to eat and everything on the menu you can order it's a place to check out no booze yet according to Amy place still waiting for their liquor license most of the review I read were true the Nigiri Sushi are not loaded with rice I will definitely come back to this place. You show up in this place better be hungry...."}
{"text":"No way, Oyshi sushi gets 4 stars and sushi factory only 3?... GTF outta here.  I had both oyshi and sushi factory all you can eat.  Sushi factory wins hands down.  Their fish is way higher in quality.  Just sit at the sushi bar and when you get your nigiris especially the salmon dam.. they give you some real thick slices.  the rolls are more on point than oyshi.  Oyshi wants everything super fatty and oily.  Sushi factory mixes great taste w/ their raw fish.  I'd eat here again anyday.  Server was on point. Ask for 2 mochis, she just might give it to you."}
{"text":"OK, so here's the deal.  Sushi Factory can be super awesome, but you have to do it right.  First, never sit at a table.  The service is slow and awful.  Sit at the bar, for sure.  The quality of the food is really good.  It's less expensive than most of the other sushi places in Vegas.  Takashi is the owner, and he is a super nice and good guy.  If you let him know what you like, he'll whip up a really nice selection for you.  If you like simple rolls, this place is perfect.  The all-you-can-eat is good, but you can definitely get full on a-la-carte.  The cajun tuna is exceptional.  Just order simple rolls: if you go crazy with designer rolls it might hurt your pocket book.  Takashi is familiar with gluten free needs.  Bring your wheat-free tamari if you wanna go gluten free, but if you forget, just get some spicy mayo or regular mayo to dip your sushi.  Of course, GF'ers should avoid the tempura, and all other sauces, including the ginger dressing.  The miso is also gluten free.  In all, the best value for sushi in Vegas, by far.  Would be 5 stars if the table service was good."}
{"text":"Friendly servers . Good food. the skewers are always great to snack on. I may come back or else stick to my usual spot"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years with my parents and family and enjoyed the dinner specials and rolls and eventually started coming with my friends. The rolls have always been so-so but over the past 5-6 years I'd have to say the service has deteriorated.  Four of my friends and I came to take advantage of a $12.50 AYCE special they were having. And you get what you pay for. First thing that I noticed as I walked in was the industrial blower fan that was serving as the air conditioner for the dining room. It was situated right by our table and directly behind me so it was hard to miss. Service started off with a bang. I arrived a little late and was told that our waitress was completely ignoring one of my friends as she tried repeatedly to order water. I ordered her water with my sprite which they were surprisingly out of. Another friend tried to order a Sapporo which they were also out of. We both settled for flat cokes.  Now to the food: we ordered 2-3 rolls/dishes each which for 5 people is a good amount. Our poke salads and miso soups came quickly enough (nothing to rave about btw). And we sat back and waited for the rest of our rolls.........and waited...........and waited. I figured I give them the benefit of the doubt and that since we had a large order, it would take a little longer. Wishful thinking, I know. About 30 minutes after not receiving anything, we asked about our orders. Our waitress said she would check and never returned. 15 minutes later we asked another waitress who told us that she would go check. She later returned with our order slip and tells us that our rolls were made by the chefs and already given to us. On our table was 4 empty plates of poke salad and 2 empty bowls of miso soup. I pointed that out to her and still she insisted that we received all our rolls. It was AYCE, mind you, and if they already made it once, what's the problem with making it again? Finally she took our order slip back to the chefs. It was an hour after we sat down that our rolls began coming out but it was as if the waitresses were holding a grudge against our table. They would drop off rolls without telling us what kind of roll it was and a lot of the time didn't know. Our cokes were refilled with more flat coke. Very, very frustrating. I later found out that another one on my friends was there the same night and rolls that they didn't order were being delivered to their table. Were they our rolls?? Maybe.....scratch that.....VERY LIKELY as the restaurant was less than half full that night. Like I said the rolls were so-so as always. The fish to rice ratio favors the rice.  After the night we had, I doubt I'll be coming back again. It's a shame because their prices are very reasonable and I'd been a customer for a while. But for $12.50 AYCE we really did get what we paid for."}
{"text":"Love this place. I've been coming here since they open and am very satisfied with the food and service. Fresh, quick and on reasonable prices. Wee  and Tony are the best! Definitely, best AYCE sushi in town."}
{"text":"I came here today to take advantage of their 9/11 week long special deal. $12 for AYCE.   Never been here because I assumed this place wouldn't be that great and damn was I right!   The rolls were okay BUT when I ordered the eel nigiri, it was the absolute WORSE eel I've ever had! Disgusting!!! First of all, it took over 30 minutes for me to even get it and when I did get it, it was dark as hell and overcooked to a point where some parts were CRUNCHY and the eel itself was supposed to be soft and flavorful but it wasn't any of that either. SUCH a disappointment.   The service was okay. A bit slow but I blame the sushi chefs for that. The chefs' sushi making seemed very inexperienced. The rice seemed like it all falling off. Ugh.  Overall, I will not be coming back.  Their regular AYCE sushi price is $20+. That's so laughable. Their reg prices should stay $12 because that's how much their food is really worth..."}
{"text":"Very clean facility with fast service. Brought my family here and the staff was nice and welcoming. The food itself was great I personally liked the quality of the sushi here than most AYCE in the area. Will be coming here again"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  Its a very chill atmosphere and good customer service.  I'd recommend sitting at the bar but the tables are still good. We always stop here on our Vegas trips and I don't see that changing any time soon.  I've never needed a reservation here, you're sat quickly and your food comes out fast.  I only come here for the all you can eat sushi, and for $25 a person why would you get anything else?!  The sushi is fresh, tastes good, comes out fast, and there's no limit.    This place is well worth your money considering 3 rolls anywhere else would already cost about $25+ and the cost of all the other buffet/all-you-can-eat places in Vegas.  I'm not going to say its the best sushi I've ever had (although the first time i was here it was definitely on the top of the list), but it's well worth the money and time.  I'll be coming back again :)"}
{"text":"New sushi in the 89139, nice concept, sushi is okay, but it's the best in this area at least. They have a special: free soda if you rate this place."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the average of this sushi joint is not higher because we had such a great experience here last night.   If you live in the Southwest or are familiar with this area, you know selections are scarce and even then it's not always quality options. So when we saw Sushi Factory on Yelp, we were hesitant because of the rating but we really didn't want to drive too far for all you can eat sushi.   Ample parking out front. The ambiance and the decor are very nice. There's this pink cherry tree right by the front and I thought that was a beautiful decoration piece. The restaurant size is not crazy big but not crazy small either.   The AYCE menu has a wide variety of choices and everything was very fresh and delicious. I always think the way to decide if the sushi is any good is by their salmon, sweet shrimp and sea urchin; all three were delectable. The staff are friendly and the price is right. The only thing I have to complain is the dessert menu. It didn't have red bean ice cream. And while it seems like it's offering quite a few items, it's really just trying too hard.   I definitely recommend Sushi Factory over the other options in this area and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"love this place! AYCE for 24.95 so its not super cheap but for how much sushi you can get its a good price. my boyfriend and I spend about 70$ when we come here because we both get AYCE and usually some sake as well. The quality of the fish is good and I'm a big fan of their sashimi and nigiri sushi. Some of their rolls are pretty good but none of them are AMAZING. It almost seems like they have too many options for one thing to really stand out. Most of the fried rolls are so big they're almost impossible to eat. The have some yummy teriyaki options on the AYCE menu as well as postickers and shumai and edemame. There's an older woman who works there and seems to be a type of owner, and she's the best to have. She's very nice and accomodating, but I've noticed some of her younger staff members are rude and take forever and they always looked pissed off. Other than that this is usually the place I come when I want a lot of sushi for a good price!"}
{"text":"Sushi Factory is a great sushi place on Eastern up toward Anthem.  They have an all you can eat lunch for $21 and dinner for $25.  Cheaper than most all-you-can-eats in town.  The two sushi chefs are great.  They are always engaging customers with jokes, singing, and conversation.  They have about a hundred different sushi options and the all you can eat includes soup, salad, edamame, pot stickers, mussels, etc..  There is also not a time limit that I have noticed, so you don't feel rushed like some other places.     My wife can't eat as much so she does the $8.95 two roll deal.  You get two sushi rolls with soup and salad.  The service is very quick whether you are at the bar or a table.  I think this is a hidden hot spot that not too many people have tried yet.    At the end they offer numerous desert options and always welcome you back.  This is a great place and I recommend everyone tries it."}
{"text":"came for the 2 for 1. was told it'd be an hour wait, called to check my spot in line after 40 minutes and was told the wait was an hour to an hour fifteen!  good sushi, well portioned (including the rolls!), just the whole waiting sutuation sucked. the bald server w/o glasses was really nice!"}
{"text":"Laid back and low key fit this place. I liked that the portions were big and that they werent as strict as some of the other all you can eat sushi places in Vegas. Good spicy tuna rolls and 911 rolls. I will come back because of the value, I dont think the rolls were as pretty or as varied as other places however."}
{"text":"This place has a dirt cheap daily lunch special - $4.95.  On the day we went it was CA roll and tempura.  Other days have combinations with chicken teriyaki.  Miso soup and salad are included.  The portions were huge.  Granted we were a group of lighter eaters (mostly senior citizens except me) but everyone seemed to have half of their rolls and a few pieces of tempura leftover.  There must have been 12 pieces of CA roll per order.  They tasted ok, just average.  The tempura was way overdone with a thick batter, and just looking at its oiliness made me queasy.  And ah yes, there was also a greasy tempura smell when entering the restaurant.  Good deal for the wallet but not the palate."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot when I was in college. They had that three items lunch special which was a really good deal. However, when I went there last week, tuna roll was not fresh,and they charged us 18% tips after tax. The worst was the food gave me diarrhea. I will not go back again. My friend told me that one time they argued with the manager with the tip issue, the manager's attitude was horrible and disrespectful."}
{"text":"The promotion for free soda is only 1 per table :(  We came for the 2 for one all you can eat promotion. They limited us on 8 orders per table until they came. Generally we like to order a few more things so they can slowly bring it out rather than us waiting a long time for an order and then placing another long order.  Still mid dinner and will update after"}
{"text":"Best value in Vegas! We come here every time we visit Vegas atleast three-four times a year. It is always the highlight of our trip."}
{"text":"I don't get people not expecting there to be a wait seeing as it is a grand opening AND a 2-for-1 special to drive business in... It's mind boggling people don't plan for it and complain and rant about the wait.  Being a smart one and planning for the wait with my friend, we patiently waited. I expected a 2 hour wait due to only seeing 2 servers, a hostess and a busser. While waiting I planned for Soyo to be our back up and even contemplated splitting our party of 2 so that my friend and I could sit away from each other at the bar! Haha. He was not a fan of that idea so we waited and was surprised it was only a little over an hour wait.  When we were seated, we promptly ordered. Nothing really stood out by way of the menu except for a few things:  1. Hit - All their nigiri was cut slightly thicker than most AYCE places. So moving forward, hopefully they stick with this and not start cutting them thinner than what it is now.  2. Hit - I am never a fan of deep fried rolls of anything mostly for the fact that the rice comes out very mushy and overcooked. Most of deep fried rolls are thick and only cut 5 pieces. Their deep fried roll however was the size of a normal roll, 8 cut, battered and deep fried.  3. Hit - Monkey Brain - seafood stuffed mushroom, deep fried and sauced. Would be really great if the stuffing was seasoned more with salt and pepper, but overall, a great stuffed mushroom.  4. Miss - Pork Belly Appetizer - for $6.95, all we got were 2 3/4\" nuggets... hopefully that's just because it was opening and they were stretching it out haha. But otherwise, great flavor.   5. Miss - Baked Mussels - great cheesy topping, but I am too used to extra mayo haha. Just add a little extra mayo to offset the cheese crust but otherwise,  decent.  6. Miss - they don't carry natto!   All in all, can't wait for them to be finished so their skewers menu opens up. As expected, they did loose a couple of our orders, but great job to the team for keeping their cool."}
{"text":"Definitely worth a try.. everything we ordered was nice and fresh.  this is my 3rd time this week! =]"}
{"text":"Ploy is so pretty. She's tops in attractive ayce sushi restaurant waitresses.  As soon as we walked in, we noticed how nice the restaurant looked and how it complemented Ploy's prettiness. As we enjoyed our sushi dinner, dish after dish was brought to us by Ploy, all the time explaining it perfectly. Problem was, even though she was expertly trained, even my wife couldn't concentrate as Ploy was just so pretty. The food was excellent we think, but who knows when someone so pretty is serving it.    5 stars for Pretty Ploy. The wife and I can't remember much else."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place I have ever eatten. The rolls are amazing and very original. Great for large parties. Open until 1am on the weekends and they don't give you a time limit on the all you can eat sushi."}
{"text":"Came for AYCE when a huge group of friends came to visit me and my cousin from Los Angeles. We used to live in the Spring Valley area and always passed this. So our big party went.   So I ordered for myself, thinking to start slow with what I can handle- 1 roll and nigiri and a tempura. Others followed suit with their orders- some not holding restraint on their orders and most are \"roll happy\". So rolls started to come out....I found mine and happily ate it...then more rolls and more rolls that everyone else ordered. A few nigiri made it, but none were the pieces I ordered....only the basic, tuna, salmon etc someone else ordered...maybe 12 pieces and thats all we saw the whole night. So many rolls kept rolling in...so many in  fact that we had to cancel anything else we ordered to get through rolls on our table. A few we couldnt even figure out who the hell ordered it...if any of us ordered it at all!  I had to help everyone else eat their rolls so we dont get charged a la carte. I dont like rainbow rolls- I did not come to eat california roll with some fish on top! There was too much rice to me in the rolls, hence stuffing us all up.  I did not like how they did not pace us or bring each person what they ordered like other AYCE's do. I had no problem at places like Sushi Mon serving us as individuals in a group..and I like that when you order nigiri first then thats what you'll get...they dont \"forget\" the order and skip to the rolls.   The server didnt look too happy with us too and was crabby serving us- this time I can't blame them. Normally me and my brother had to speak/apologize for the group. Mind you they dont know how to shut up most of them....they're so loud the deaf can hear it...but also we've never had ALL the loud ones in a group dinner with us...it was the complete symphony of cackling gays.  Kinda embarrassing and I apologize if you were there on a night a party of 12 gays were there with me and had to hear their bullshit. If I was any of you, I woulda slapped all of us.   It was just not a pleasant night at all and though my friends are asses, if the staff served like other AYCE's did we wouldnt have had problems with being roll overwhelmed.   I still cant get near anything with crab or I gag and this was months ago.   Maybe I'll come back as a friend said they really like the sushi chef here and is a regular, but I dunno.  Maybe the BF and I will come with the our friend who loves this place to give it a fair rating."}
{"text":"This has become my new favorite sushi spot. Great service, fresh sushi, and cool atmosphere. Great local spot for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite AYCE sushi place in Vegas.  I'm going somewhere else and looking at the other Yelp reviews, there are a lot of other choices.  When my brother in law introduced me to this place over five years ago and it was fanastic!  The sushi nirigi had small balls of rice and was mostly fish.  There are a lot of choices, they had specials, i.e. ladies night, free Asahi, etc.  What's changed?  A few things:  1.  They now charge for green tea when it was free before, and to add insult to injury, they didn't tell me about it till the bill came!  Good thing I was on a business trip and was able to charge it to my trip expenses.  Being such a tightwad, it didn't matter if it was on mine or the company's dime.  2.  The quality of the fish has gone down a bit and also, they added more rice and not as much fish.  I think this is probably some cost cutting moves here.  3.  The specials are not as good, and nothing worth mentioning.  At least there are some good things: one, they now offer raw oysters for dinner (if you like that).  A new offering is poke and it's pretty darn good!"}
{"text":"Once you sift your way through all the Smith's shopping carts you find a pretty good little place, and it beats battling for parking on Spring Mountain, and the noisiness of Nobu.  We would come here special or no special (though the 2 for 1 Asahi nights is enough reason right there), but it's always fresh - plus they have oysters!  Decor could use an update yes, but you find yourself too busy stuffing your face to notice.  At least we were able to order our sushi directly at the counter (we didn't see our server too often - one more on to help couldn't hurt), and they did us a few special requests that other places didn't.   Don't forget your stamp card, we've gone through two!"}
{"text":"Pros: -HUGE selection on the all-you-can-eat menu -Many items on AYCE menu are non-sushi items -Delicious and innovative sushi rolls -Spacious restaurant -Open til 2am on weekends -Generally attentive waitstaff  Cons: -HUGE selection on the all-you-can-eat menu -If they're busy, your food will take forever -Some fish is obviously frozen -If you're ordering a lot of 1 item, they'll suddenly \"run out\" of it next time you order it  Generally a good experience. My family ate here twice when we spent the holidays in Vegas. First night (Christmas night) our waiter seemed very new. Took our sushi order once and then never returned to see if we wanted anything else. We literally had to stop him and ask him if we could order again, and he seemed surprised. WTF? This is all you can eat sushi, babe. And we're Japanese. We needs more food mmkay? He got confused by our order and screwed up w/ the chef, so we ended up not receiving some of our food, but some of the other waiters (and I think owner) stepped in and we got everything we wanted and more. We were more than satisfied with our meal, so I really can't complain. PLUS, it was Christmas night. We'll let that one slide.   Second visit (12/29) we went for lunch so it was empty. Our waitress was quick and attentive. We ordered about 16 orders of hamachi (and ate it all) before we were told that it was now \"unavailable.\" Then we saw a table near us receive a few orders of hamachi so we were thinking they were trying to screw us out of what we wanted. Ordered more hamachi with another waiter and it was available again. Interesting! But all in all, another good meal.   Despite a little weirdness in our service we'll definitely be back to terrorize this joint."}
{"text":"This place is new good food and service definitely recommend this place if you wanna go crazy on sushi this is the right place and their sides are awesome too. surely coming back for round 2."}
{"text":"Food is good, sashimi, sweet shrimp, urchin, and oyster pretty fresh! Rolls are good too. Environment is clean. Nice place."}
{"text":"We had the Candy Cane roll (fresh, delicious) and the Spicy Salmon Tar Tare, a must eat !! 4 stars given because even though we were the only 11 pm guests, our server forgot to bring us a water, otherwise good service :)"}
{"text":"My new favorite!  Great atmosphere, friendly staff and delicious sushi!  Try the sweet 16 and Chicago Fire."}
{"text":"The Sushi Factory was nice! Just opened a few days ago. The atmosphere is warm and friendly. The staff knows how to run a sushi bar. The chefs made everything quickly and delicately despite the crowded restaurant. The chefs recommended a few great items. Everything was fresh. And they had plenty of Uni for me and my wife! We will go again."}
{"text":"This is the place I first popped my \"sushi cherry\" all those years ago and I've been coming here eversince when I'm in town, but sadly I noticed it's getting progressively worse. It's looking pretty beat, The people are getting less friendly and the food isn't what it once was. In other words it used to be 4+ on the stars now a 3 in my book... Come on guys how bout a deep cleaning and a come to jesus meeting with your employee's."}
{"text":"The food here was great, we sat at the bar and the sushi chef Tony did an excellent job. He was super friendly, always made sure we had something to eat and made great recommendations. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"for a lunch break, i came here on a wednesday to get their lunch special for 7  - wed: teriyaki chicken and tempura (7: 5 vegetable + 2 shrimp), miso soup, salad, and orange slices for dessert.  - fast and friendly service. having less than half an hour to eat, service was on point. food was fresh. water was refilled (huge cup), and check given promptly! - good portion. for what it's worth, it's able to last for the rest of the work day. i don't feel too full or too hungry. just right :) - average taste. don't expect superstar flavor.  - this place puts sushi imagine (henderson) in SHAME for their teriyaki chicken lunch special.  - 5 stars bc i'd come back again for their lunch specials! :)"}
{"text":"we do all u can eat here... sit at the sushi bar and order up. they have so many rolls to choose from... a lil overwhelming.  but the sushi chefs are very nice and friendly....   good place for sushi... but it is a lil run down...i like the restaurant on trop better."}
{"text":"we did all u can eat here.. me and the girls love it here.  its a nicer restaurant then the one on eastern... the sushi chefs are friendly... a few are from hawaii.. they always make fresh and yummy sushi rolls..."}
{"text":"After hearing either really bad or really good reviews of this place, I decided to give it a try...and came out with a rather unassuming average review instead!   Sushi Factory is located in a plain and slightly seedy looking strip mall. Being from the East Coast, I know that most good restaurants are not in the best of neighborhoods, so I was excited...Decor was also run down, but not terrible inside. It was tacky a bit dirty, but definitely inviting in a \"homey\" type of way.  Service was average. We had to ask our waitress quite a few times to refill my water, but she always obliged and often walked by and never disappeared. Her attitude was rather aloof, but she \"blessed\" us with her smile a couple of times, so average rating she gets.  We ordered some nigiri, sashimi and fresh oysters. I wasn't in a mood (for once) to eat a lot :). Fresh oysters were, how do I say this?, pretty fresh. I didn't expect for these to be good, but they were. Not the best I've had by any means, but definitely tasty. Sushi was edible and tasty as well, however, fish was not the freshest and presentation was rather poor. Miso soup and salad were the best part of the meal, and had very good flavor to them. Prices were incredibly cheap for a sushi place.  Overall, I may come back to Sushi Factory, but only because my best friend lives across the street. I will not make a special trip to go there, as there are so many better sushi places in Vegas...However, if I'm in a neighborhood and craving some sushi, and running low on money $$$$ I will stop by and experience Sushi Factory again."}
{"text":"We have been ordering the skewer for more than thirty minutes and it is not coming yet. We have all you can eat menu and I have been ordering the skewers for more than 45 minutes. They kept running out of food. They said they are running out of bacon and mochi ice cream. Their service speed is very slow. Never come back again."}
{"text":"Some of the most high quality, best tasting AYCE sushi I've had in a long time. Service is fast and spot on!!!!"}
{"text":"When you first enter the building, it is nothing special. The decor of the restaurant is sparse and bare. It is an open space with a lot of room. You will not suffocate from close proximation to other guest.  The service is fantastic. The sushi chef that took care of us was quick and rolled a tight roll. The waiter removed dirty dishes promptly and refilled our drinks in a timely manner.   The nigiri is the highlight of the whole menu. The generous cuts of fish is a good balance to the amount of rice. The starch is well flavored and has a good consistency. The rolls are nothing spectacular. The ones marked as spicy do not hold up to the chili pepper symbol that sits next to the name. The tempura batter is also too thick and does not fry up crisp enough to give a contrast to the rest of the ingredients.  The seaweed salad and ahi poke are delicious. I ordered two to share with a friend and found that I had devoured most of it before he saw what happened. The poke is not like anything you have seen before. They do not believe in small chunks, these pieces are the size of Vienna sausages. I do not mind and actually prefer it this way.   The nigiri is what makes the all you can eat worth it. Lunch will set you back $21.95."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out on a Friday night. There was no wait! Our server, Stephanie was such an amazing server! We tried numerous items on the menu. I liked how they have a \"no rice roll\" section. We tried the Cherry Blossom & Johnny. Cherry Blossom was the best by far. Candy Cane was my favorite on the \"soft shell crab roll.\"   The baked green mussels were good, but too cheesy for my tasting. The cucumber with crab salad wasn't marinated enough, but it could of been better.   Overall, ended the dinner with mango mochi, FBI and green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"Years ago, this was my favorite sushi spot. It's moved down that list a ways, mostly because my tastes have branched out. Decent quality food but it seems like some combinations of the same 5 things are used in every roll."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was very nice and clean, service was good! Sushi was excellent! Tako wasabi one of my fav. I recommend this spot for a ayce sushi"}
{"text":"the \"hook\" for this restaurant is their all you can eat sushi which for your sake, DON'T DO IT. all you can eat is not neccessarily a good thing, unless you came from a war torn country and your last good meal was taking a bite out of your dead neighbor's rotting corpse. I am NOT one of THOSE. bulk eating makes me think of muffin tops, food comas, and crapping in my pants. all you can eat is no bueno!  anyways, i decided against the all you can eat sushi option and settled on their combo meal (shrimp tempura and california rolls) with a spicy tuna roll for an appetizer. nothing was particularly outstanding. the rolls were mushy and it was obvious the spicy tuna was not of the best quality because you can taste the \"veins\" in it. you know, that elasticky chewy white part in the flesh that shouldn't be there!  since i'm not familiar with sushi in nevada, i cannot offer another \"you should go here instead option.\" i'm sure the strip has lots, but in henderson, i am baffled as to how this place survives."}
{"text":"Good sushi and sashimi. I also enjoyed the toast.  The concept is pretty good and it's pretty close from my house. Service was pretty goo too."}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi spot! I live past windmill and always drive all the way to sushi Neko on spring mountain to get my fix. This spot is the only GOOD AYCE around SW area. I would rather drive across town than eat at some of the bad sushi restaurants over here lol. This place does everything right. I'm not much of a roll kind of gal but the one I had was pretty good. Been here a few times now and everything has been consistent so far. Fresh fish, good service, and nice ambiance. A+ from me"}
{"text":"I have to agree with Shoe K.   Please don't waste your time patronizing this place.  \"All-you-can eat\", yeah right.  More like, \"All you can eat, as long as it's not uni, ikura, hamachi, ama ebi etc.\"  This was a go to spot my buddies and I would hit up while in Vegas, but after our last visit, forget it.  The service was horrible.  I can't stress that enough.  We only received our first order of sushi (which included the aforementioned uni, ikura, hamachi etc.), and after a subsequent similar order, we did not receive.  Waiters continually asking if someone had taken our order, or the kitchen is being cleaned, again if someone had taken our order, on and on.  Total BS."}
{"text":"We came here during the grand opening special of buy one get one free unlimited sushi. We waited about 1 hour to get sat. Once sat, the service was slow but it was expected how busy they were. They did forget our rolls numerous times and keep having to order them twice. Over all, not a bad place and we will be back."}
{"text":"I'm seriously hoping these 1 star reviews before this review will be flagged. Don't just write a review just because you couldn't get seated to eat. Maybe if you cheapskates didn't complain so much, maybe the promotion could've lasted through it's planned time.   Done ranting, let's talk about the food and service. My gf and I went on Thursday at 5:30, we didn't care that the promotion ended just because we heard that the food was good. The food was actually good too, the agedashi tofu was probably my favorite appetizer dish. Our waters were also being constantly refilled and they constantly checked up on us. The only reason why I'm knocking out a star is because the Kama always took longer than expected, but it's not the servers fault because they constantly kept checking up on it. The kitchen needs to step it up on their time management. I wouldn't mind coming back here now that there's finally a decent sushi place in that area!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended. Been  here twice this week.  Fresh fish, Amazing sushi... It's out of this world sushi! No comparison!!! Great sushi chefs, V & Tony. V & Tony keep up the great work. We will be back again!  If you are in the Vegas area & want to eat sushi, This is a must place to visit!!! Five Stars all the way!"}
{"text":"I don't see myself going back to this location. It took almost 30 mins to receive my food, and it was not crowded. Maybe 6 other people in the restaurant if that. There were many items that were not available that were on the menu. He almost poured water in my soda, thank goodness I didn't step away and I was there to stop him. If you enjoy a beer with your sushi you can forget about it, they are still working on a liquor license. The sushi wasn't that great either. The music was nice and my sprite was tasty. Maybe once they've been open for a while it'll get better."}
{"text":"I have been going to Sushi Factory for a couple years now, and I love the all-u-can-eat menu, however in the last 6 mos or so, they have lowered the price and excluded some items such as the Screaming Orgasm. Otherwise, the sushi chefs (especially the weekend ones) are skilled and clean and the food is delicious! I don't have to wait each time I go to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Proceed with caution.   Nigiri sushi. Not bad. Poki. It was spicy which was unusual for Poki. Had them remake it as I am unable to eat spicy foods at this time. No bueno. It was overall sweet now. Weird. Anything that could have ponzu or unagi sauce was covered in sauce all over. It was like sauce with a side of sushi. I love some sauce but not that much. Made many/all of the items too sweet to eat. I wanted to like salt to off set all the sweet. I needed to substitute some things cause I am unable to eat spicy foods but then they keep taking out all the fish/tuna from the item.  Communication was a little difficult. Not great overall for the sushi dishes from all you can eat menu.   Would try the dinner all you can eat maybe. But not in a hurry to come back. I would prefer my usual sushi spots. More to say later but just proceed with caution. Some stuff is good. Others, I've had better. Overall the sushi size, quality is eh and small. Not Bad but not good.   I would try the dinner options first. As there is more to pick from with the all you can eat. And there are also daily specials. Also I did like they had more different rolls/options than other places. Lisa and Barbie roll were pretty good. Salmon skin roll had unagi sauce on it. Weird.   Service was spotty. Went when it wasn't busy at first then got super busy. But felt like they were not understanding what i was asking for due to my no spicy food condition currently.   Nuff said for now."}
{"text":"Pros: They give you generous portions. Quality & freshness has always been excellent when I've went there. Amazing deals with all you can eat (ladies' night is the main reason why I keep coming back!). Menu is full of unique, different, and plentiful meals! The prices are one of the high points for all that you can get!  Cons: Service is slow for sit down in the dining room, the sushi chef \"shogun\" attitude is a little over the top (or some chefs just don't make things personalized with their customers?), waitresses have forgotten items twice before.  I've been going to SF since 2006. A couple years back when I first started going the service wasn't as slow in the dining room as it is now, and from what others have said, if you come in hungry wanting to hit plates back to back, sitting at the bar is your best bet for quick service.  SF would have so much potential if some of the chefs eased up a little on the \"shogun\" attitude & if there was better service. I've had waitresses forget appetizers twice before, or have forgotten and realized their mistake, which made us wait even longer to get our items.   Takashi is the owner & is such a great guy to speak with! Takashi & some of the chefs that have been around SF for awhile are the ones who are most likely to speak casually to customers, but otherwise these new people they've hired over the years could use some work with customer service.  I really hate to give SF three stars because the quality/pricing really is a great deal for a sushi joint in Vegas (and the owner is an unbelievably nice guy), but I really do hope these guys realize there needs to be a little more work with their chefs/waitresses when it comes to service!"}
{"text":"Is this even sushi? I went there since my friend at work raved about how good their sushi is. I thought this place was probably the worst sushi I have had in a long time. The prices were pretty high and their food quality is sub par at best. I had their all you can eat dinner special at $24.95. I had their paradise roll, mountain roll and daves roll. I wasn't that bad but I definitely had way better. If these were their best rolls then I have to say I will not be back there ever again. The only good thing about their sushi is that they don't give you a ton of rice with their nigiri, however, their fish quality is horrid compared to other all you can eat places. Their tuna nigiri was warm and pink!? I thought that was really weird. I don't like this place. They really need a make over and a design consultant to revamp this sad restaurant. It is a waste of time and money. Do not go here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for the first time and I  think we might've found our new sushi spot! Fresh sushi, a lot of selections and great service. Wish I had gotten our servers name but he was an Asian dude with glasses and he was the best!! Super nice and attentive at all times. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Came during lunch. 1st time visit. Server Melissa was awesome,friendly, attentive. Food was good. Had only 1 sushi chef at the time but he was working his best. Another chef came later on, then things finally started going.   Would comeback again."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a different sushi spot instead of our norm sushi spots we hit up, so I decided to go here. We Walked in n the decor was cool n the scenery look comfortable n inviting. So the lady greeted us n asked if we would like a table or sit @ the sushi bar, so we decided on the bar. So we walked over n 2 chiefs were busy on their sides n that left us with an older sushi chief with nobody on his side so we sat down and ordered. The ladies who served our drinks n brought out other dishes were very good in service n friendly. So Long story short, sushi took Forever to make, sushi was okay, sushi chief really was slow, ladies service was good. Wife got sick later that night n we will Not be Going Back at all."}
{"text":"I met up with some friends who were visiting from Tucson who used to eat here with me prior to moving to AZ. We were contemplating on trying a new place or going to the old faithful sushi factory in which we were familiar with. I said sushi factory it is as I was not in the mood to try a new place and run a chance of it sucking, I just wanted what I knew and fast!   We go here for the AYCE yes the all you can eat sushi. They have good rolls and a nice generous selection of options.  I tend to order half rolls so I can try many, that is not a problem.   You go here for the food, to eat and get your fill of sushi. Not for the service, the guys behind the bar making your rolls are attentive however not friendly and they never smile or talk to you other than the \"thank you\" as you are almost out of the door.   I had my friends to shoot the shit with but I could not stop looking at and staring in amazement at the permanent frowns on the sushi guys faces. It is just odd, I have never seen anything like it before.   We always sit at the bar so we can freely order without having to wait for a waiter or waitress to take our orders in the dining area they have as well.   The best quality sushi? NO  Can you get stuffed silly? YES  AYCE? YES  Friendly and inviting atmosphere? NO"}
{"text":"Great place for all you can eat sushi and it's an excellent alternative to sushi-mon down the road.... Mainly because when we walked in last night, there was no wait and we were seated right away.   One of the best things about this place is the all you can eat sushi is limited to the whole menu and includes other dishes like Gyoza and edamame (which are probably included at other places but I never noticed)  And while your there and sitting at the sushi bar, buy the sushi chef a shot or two or six of sake! He will greatly appreciate it. $1 sake on Monday nights to!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, but service was a tad bit slow and this is AFTER the BOGO promotion, during the afternoon on a Monday. Servers were attentive and friendly. Will be back"}

{"text":"This place is a good place to go for sushi on a budget.  The atmosphere was definitely nice and chill.  I think the cute little oranges at the end of the meal was awesome."}
{"text":"Came here once right when they open. We do AYE, and almost everything was just about right. Had a great service with a waitress don't remember her name. Today came back for second time and have AYE again. Service was not so great. The first thing I order grill yellow tail collar. The waitress never told me that they don't have it. So I was still waiting for an hour still didn't come so I thought I ask when is the grill yellow collar come out and she said sorry we don't have it today. At the end of our meal my husband order the miso soup and still never come out 20 mins later I decided to ask for the bill. I did told the waitress about the order never came out and all she said was sorry and still ask me if I want a punch card. Why would they even ask me that? Duh   Never again I will NOT be back!"}
{"text":"The place so cool and the sushi so great!! And they have fried banana W/ice cream!! The price not that bad for dinner $26!"}
{"text":"All you can eat quality sushi! Fresh fish and good service! The shoyu pork, super white  albacore tina, uni, and ikura is a must get. Their desserts are good too! I recommend the honey toast"}
{"text":"My favorite place for all you can eat sushi! Lunch is $22, dinner is $25. They also offer a la carte rolls if that's your forte, but why not splurge?! All You Can Eat also includes things like (but not limited to) soup, edamame, tempura, yakitori, and ice cream. I love the open feel of the new location (original is at Flamingo & Rainbow)."}
