{"text":"Good sandwiches and baked goods but poor management. 1 cashier takes orders, makes coffee and gets/prepares food. Even with a short line it takes a long time."}
{"text":"First time today and had the breakfast panini!  It was great.  I intended on going here to study but the concept is a bit open to study.  The noise levels are up there and it's a bit of a mixed crowd.  From business professionals to mothers with babies which is great but not conducive to focus time.  Staff are friendly and quick!"}
{"text":"They only deserve a star and that's because Kat is amazing, The other staff are the worst .. They always get my drink wrong I stopped coming every week day just because they ruin my morning's even on my days off sometimes I find myself stopping into Cranston good earth and regretting it and wishing I went to Seton.. I honestly HATE the staff they make me late when I'm just grabbing something quick to eat even when there is enough staff and are not busy.. I don't expect to be number one but when they wont even acknowledge me, I  just find it very rude. They refuse to even try to make my drink right ... . I'm here every day .. All I want is at the end of my green tea latte is not to get chunks and puke. It's always a hit or miss when I go, 2nd time i've posted a review .. you think they would learn."}
{"text":"I love this location because it is in a great spot in a very active community. The food and drinks selection is wonderful and it always tastes delicious. In addition, the fact that you can get wine here is wonderful.  I also like that when you stay they give you your drinks in reusable mugs rather than paper such as Starbucks because it's more environmentally friendly. I also like that they help support local businesses such as selling Fiasco Gelato at their store.  The one thing that is my most favourite about this location is the patio. It is huge with so much seating space and they leave a water dish out for dogs :)"}
{"text":"Spacious and Clean, wonderful staff and a great outdoor seating area.   Try the chai latte and the hot soup of the day."}
{"text":"A nice patio to enjoy a cold drink on a hot day! Nice and clean location with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Had to head out to the deep South to drop off a couple Scouts popcorn orders to friends and family.  Decided to drop in to the Good Earth to grab a bite, try out a new coffee joint and a visit with a friend.  Lovely space and very clean.  The customer service was very good and the staff friendly.  We had our kidlets with us and were pleased to see a smaller section with kids activities (toys, etc.) and also a section with games for older kids.  I love a coffee shop that recognizes & appreciates mom's (families) with young kids.    For food I was pleased to see a nice but simple selection that catered to all of us.  The Panini sandwiches were delicious.  The kids were considering home made macaroni & cheese or chili but in the end one ended up with a sandwich and a very large & fresh fruit bowl.  The fresh bakery selection was also tempting.  I loves me a good coffee and my cappuccino was spot on.  Since we were here in winter we didn't get to check out the patio but it looked decent from our view point inside.  Definitely a must if you are in the South or even to grab something to go while en-route out of town."}
{"text":"I used this location for a bunch of baked good trays for customers before Christmas. Trays were ready on time, in easy to carry boxes for delivery, and very nicely presented. My customers came back with rave reviews!"}
{"text":"They have a toy section for kids and my son just loves it. The snacks are great and they have wonderful drinks. The staff have never wowed me but are always polite enough."}
