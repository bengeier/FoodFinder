{"text":"I ordered delivery through Eat 24 and the restaurant confirmed my order.  I then waited an hour and a half and called but no one answered. They never showed up and I had top be refunded by Eat 24.  Don't waste your time ordering from them.  I actually don't even think they are still open.  If they are they won't for long!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pasta dinner and Stromboli through Eat 24. The site showed an estimated 45-60 mins for delivery, and they arrived almost exactly at the 1 hour mark. The pasta noodles were over cooked, but the sauce's flavor was OK. My boyfriends Stromboli was \"alright\" and unexpectedly large. The garlic knots were very, very good. I added a little of my own garlic, but I would buy them again here.   I've had much worse. I will probably try Smashlee's again at some point."}
