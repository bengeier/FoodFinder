{"text":"When we pulled up to this place for our 5 pm reservation I thought maybe it went out of business. There were a group of  5 guys smoking in front of a door that perhaps at one time was an entrance.Then there was another door where dresses and clothing was being  taken out of the building by the droves. I walked in through that door  and waited to be seated in side the resturant   The TV was blareing and after waiting 5 minnutes we finnaly were seated in an empty resturant with the exception of a large group of men sitting in a corner table staring at us.. There were dirty tables that had not be bussed and when the waiter came over with water to pour inside a dirty glass I stoped him and said..Thanks but No Thanks we are leaving..He asked if the prices are too high I replied I didnt even bother to look at the menu sorry and got up and left.y"}
{"text":"I came here with some of my family friends becuase one of their kids had a project about Indian culture. So, we decided to come here to try their food. To be honest I didn't know what to expect about this place, but I just have to say that I had such a wonderful experience.   - Great environment  (cool music)  - Great food; very colorful and so delicious!  - Great service from the staff   * If you are willing to try something out of your \"comfortable\" zone and you like to experiment with diverse dishes from around the world this is a great place to start!  * For those who expect a \"luxurious\" place to eat this place might not be what you are looking for, but this restaurant is so welcoming and very peaceful.  * I have to say that this review is specifically about the buffet, so I can't really judge how's the their entire menu  My warm regards to the staff members and the chef!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was not one of the best.. It was way overpriced.. Food was mediocre.. The ambience was nice however. Would not recommend this. Try something else for Indian such as the Indian Masala Bistro."}
{"text":"The food was pretty awful and at the end of our meal my hands were literally yellow, we asked the manager what it was and she casually said it was food color. Not only was she nonchalant about it but suggested using alcohol to remove it. I would recommend eating anywhere else in the Las Vegas besides this place !! Trust me do not waste your time and money on this place. I wish they had negative stars for places like this."}
{"text":"It took a lot of courage to eat here after seeing that they were recently shut down due to a cockroach infestation.  Apparently they were featured on a show called \"dirty dining\" as well.  Well, their proximity to my hotel and the lack of good Indian food where I live allowed me to make a very trepidatious visit.  Sadly, not worth it.  The food was very much on the bland side, service was amateur, and when I presented them the Yelp 10% discount, they requested that I give them a positive review.  Well, here's your review guys.   Other things of note, the restaurant was nearly empty on a Saturday night at 7pm, and the restrooms could have been cleaner.  Fortunately, I saw no evidence of roaches in my palak paneer, but I certainly paused to wonder if they might have inadvertently been serving a few cockroach curries that evening.  The food did not sit well in my stomach."}
{"text":"Hmmm... I can't believe that other yelpers didn't like Gandhi, as I have had only excellent dining experiences there.  I've never tried the buffet, and have been wanting to... but maybe I won't now after what you guys said about it.  I'm also vegetarian, so if their meat is horrible, I have no idea about that.    I have had the Narvatan Korma twice (excellent) and the Aloo Palak (yum!  You can tell it's full of butter...but who cares it's so good).  The first 2 times I was there they brought pappadoms as an appetizer; I was a little disappointed when they didn't on my last visit.  Not usually crowded unless you're there at peak dinner time on weekends.  The room is kind of cavernous, I wouldn't want to sit right in the middle surrounded by tables of people.  Try to get one of the super comfy booths around the outside.     Waiters are nice and super cute!"}
{"text":"Crystal was very sweet and helpful with my dietary restrictions! Lovely atmosphere and the food was authentic and subtly spicy. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Last night i went for a dinner with my family, the food is awesome. Everything taste so perfect as if its like melting in mouth and excellent service. They treat and serve their customers very well. I was serve by a indian girl name TARUNA and she is very couteaous to us. Saurav"}
{"text":"Even though it doesn't look it from the outside, this place is actually very good in terms of food and ambience. They handle spices well. Chicken Bhuna and chicken Korma were great. For a place with fleeting traffic like Vegas, this place does justice to Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Love this place, the food is very delicious! The waiters were constantly making sure we had everything we needed. Cool decorations, definitely a spot we'll come back to."}
{"text":"My mom and I went to Gandhi for an early dinner after her flight came in.  We pretty much had the place to ourselves.  My mom had been here before and really enjoyed it.  We are eating vegetarian and they have a good selection on their menu.  Very helpful.  Everything was delicious.  Crystal H. was our waitress and she was wonderful!"}
{"text":"satpal was super speedy, and very kind. Good chicken tikka masala. Liked their Bollywood music choice."}
{"text":"I am here from . Baltimore . Indian food like this place . Excellent service with mind blowing food . Highly recommended .. Love it .."}
{"text":"Despite being located in a seedy strip mall, a friend and I had previously tried this place for dinner, and it was decent, 3-star territory. However a recent visit to try their lunch buffet was a different story. The first thing that stuck out was the cheap plastic plates, disposable plastic eating utensils, and styrofoam/plastic cups for water and soups/sauces. I have been to many Indian lunch buffets, but this was the first time I've seen such cheap dining ware being used. While they had several vegetarian offerings, they only had a couple of mediocre meat dishes: chicken tikka masala and tandoori chicken. There was a huge tray of naan which looked overly doughy and dried out so I didn't even bother trying it. The subpar mango pudding was too watery and contained cheap canned fruit. The halwa dessert was extremely dry and just gross. My friend and I commented that the only thing at the buffet that they seemed to do pretty well was the basmati rice.  When the bill came, I was in for another shock. $12.95 for an Indian lunch buffet?!? That has got to make this the priciest one in town since most are in the range of $9.99 to $10.99. Now if this buffet was one of the best, I probably wouldn't mind paying a premium price. Come to think of it, if they lowered the price to $8.95, it still wouldn't be worth it. There are just too many better places in town, i.e. Taj Palace or Mt Everest., to waste your appetite on this one."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating Indian food and it was awesome! The chicken nan was so good! The potato cakes and spiced garbanzo beans were a bit too spicy for me. Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is based on my recent visit (end of Sept. 2011), food there was delicious. Specially Butter Chicken and Paneer Masala.... yum! Me and my wife were amazed on how good tasting both entrees were... for a buffet!"}
{"text":"Really good Indian food. It tasted like it was actually Indian and not a western copy. Quite spicy. A lot of vegan options."}
{"text":"TL;DR: adequate food best served at a rarely-used regional airport.  We've been looking forward to going to this restaurant for a long time, so we had high expectations for the dinner.  How to quantify he disappointment? Well, imagine being told that you were going to meet a great Indian leader named Gandhi, only to find that it was Sonia, Indira's son's wife, not the Mahatma. Sure, it would be neat to meet the president of the Congress Party, but, still.  We chose two dishes: chicken korma and lamb biryani.  The korma was passable in a pinch, but the biryani was a disaster.  Biryani is supposed to have delectable pieces of meat, slowly cooked to a tender, savory consistency. The lamb in this dish tasted and felt as though it was re-used from a prior day (or recycled from the lunch buffet); tough, slightly dry, and almost flavorless.  Regarding the korma, in our experience korma has a very rich and savory taste, almost buttery, that fills the mouth. This dish was ok, but had a slightly greasy aftertaste. The gravy (if that's the right term) was thin and only vaguely flavorful.  Also, and this may be a small issue, but why separate charges for the oily jasmine rice?  Ambiance: we were assaulted by what I can only term \"Indian Booty Music\" when we entered the establishment. We're familiar with Bollywood-style music and music videos; what was playing, however, was some mixture of Beyonc√©'s Lemonade and Brittany Spear's snake dance and Indian music.  It was loud and obnoxious, but it was turned down quite a bit after we entered.  The decorating was done as an homage to the second Matrix movie.  We were the first guests of the evening, and only two couples arrived while we were there.  Perhaps it's the location (next to a series disgusting small shops), but the entire joint has a slightly seedy vibe, and maybe that's what's causing the problems the owners clearly are having with this place."}
{"text":"the bill was $100 for 4 tiny bowls of food and three beers. we got there at 4 pm and we were the only ones there, and had to stand around to wait for a staff member. food was not bad, but worth a fraction of what we paid."}
{"text":"Fresh food, excellent taste and very nice new owner. I tried a few others and had to go back to Gandhi time and again. Buffet was excellent too and when ordered service was quick compared to their competitors."}
{"text":"The food was OK at best. We want on Monday in the after-noon and it looks like they were serving food left over from the past weekend."}
{"text":"Awesome Food. Great Service. Definitely would recommend for Authentic Indian food in a classy style"}
{"text":"My boss wanted to go here... so we had to...  The decor is a bit dark but nice and clean.  I thought it was a bit pricey for the limited selection.  Food is flavorful though.  Already been back a few times."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 veg entrees yday for Togo (malai kofta and dal makhani) and mistakenly they gave us Matar paneer instead of malai kofta. When we called the restaurant,  and explained the front desk of their mistake , lady at d front desk put us on never ending hold and did not even apologize.  Guys , at least have some courtesy to apologize...Very Bad of Such a nice Name Restaurant...and we had to throw Matar Paneer out since it was not of the taste and pathetic to eat. MONEY WASTED !!!"}
{"text":"Had this place last night and it was very good.  Ordered the tandoori mixed grill, chicken tikka masala, & paneer kadhai and all three dishes were hot and flavorful.  The service was a bit slow and since there were only few other tables being used thought it would've been better. Maybe they were a little short on staff since it was a Tuesday night.  Would've given 5 stars if the service more on the spot."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food in Vegas! Incredible service everytime! This place has a wonderful atmosphere, I never leave disappointed. They have the best Indian food I have ever tasted. Great family owned business. Honestly a must try!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch buffet and even better hospitality. Very warm and friendly staff who went out of their way to make us comfortable especially since we were traveling with 2 one year old babies. Will definitely stop there again when in Vegas"}
{"text":"I like Gandhis, always have. Sure, the parking is sketchy, and I wouldn't live in the adjoining neighborhood if they paid me, and there's at least 1 guy that lives (or @ least weekends) by the dumpsters, but this restaurant is very very good with an awesome buffet, beautiful decor and quality service... and that's all I can ask of them to be."}
{"text":"Me and my friends came to Gandhi tonight to eat the best Indian food in Vegas we had chicken tikka and lamb bryani and butter chicken it was amazing!! We are from Phoenix we will definitely  be back!!!"}
{"text":"Pathetic food & quality of services. I don't know how they can provide such awful service in the connected world like today.  I don't want to waste my time writing about this crapy place..."}
{"text":"The place is very close to the vegas strip with Amazing food and decent ambience!!  The service staff is very nice and polite, thanks for the great food!   Would love to come back.."}
{"text":"They have some of the best service In Las Vegas, most reasonably priced dishes, and most authentic flavor of any Indian food I've had across the country. This is a gem hidden just a few blocks from the madness that is the strip. Perfect date spot"}
{"text":"I was on a vacation with my girl friend was craving for Indian food. Finally on the busy strip,I found Gandhi. Though I'm an Indian, its been long I had Indian food.    We were there for the buffet.The place was packed. There were lots variety of foods and  is one of the best buffets.Plenty of options for non-vegetarians and even for vegetarians like me.Navratna korma was awesome.  Crew was friendly and were prompt in serving.They made us feel like at home which justifies the crowd inside.It is definitely a good Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Not a good service experience after the third time. They give preference to people who arrive after you and i would not reccomend going there. Terrible experience from the OWNER."}
{"text":"Simply the best food in Vegas!! Very courteous staff!! I will definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Worst experience. Stale food was served after heating up with sweeteners. I've been to tens of Indian restaurants. This offered the worst food. If you wish you go still, I hope you get fresh food."}
{"text":"Tonight I went with my family to Gandhi for Indian food that was excellent  experience because what we order was so tasty and outstanding. Paneer tikka, tandoori chicken, dal makhni was so tasty and paneer tikka masala was mouth watering. Gandhi naan are always best one In whole vegas. Gandhi food  is excellent food and it remind me of India food .Gandhi staff was good in service and the owner was very friendly. Crystal and Paul was very friendly and helpful for everything. My daughter loved paneer tikka because it's made as per her choice taste. I would love to   recommend my friends  to visit Gandhi Cuisine food when they come to Vegas . I LOVE GANDHI CUISINE FOOD."}
{"text":"The food tastes horrible, rice was not cooked properly. Also the food was not fresh. Please do not even try this place."}
{"text":"Came in during lunch .. understandable they have buffet .. all we asked for a la Carte menu due to dietary restrictions for one person . It was a simple request for scrambled eggs which would have taken only 5 mins but they upfront refused or cared a damn about customer service .. air headed asinine people I should say .. food quality wasn't great either .. don't waste your $$$ .. there are better places out there"}
{"text":"I have to say that the good was decent. Now I am an Indian and I eat at Indian restaurants in NJ and India all the time. Service really need to be worked on or they will have a hard time.   For an Indian restaurant in the US I was quite impressed that their plates and cups were clean. Restrooms, like all indian restaurants were dirty and overfilled with fabreez.    While we were there paying the check they had a call from a customer complaining about an delivery and it was not handled professionally while there were many others listening to her on the phone.   Small changes and they could be the best place to eat indian food in Vegas."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Indian Punjabi food you must check out this restaurant. Forget about all other fancy restaurants who serve bland Indian food. This is true Punjabi authentic food."}
{"text":"We just arrived from Orlando and went to this restaurant. The experience was not great from service to food. We ordered couple of plates of lamb biryani and it did not taste like biryani and tasted like yellow rice turned white and some meat tossed in it. The serves were also very small for the price we paid. We spent over $100 and it was not its value from a quality and service perspective.  Hope we received better service and quality Indian food."}
{"text":"Really good food! Crystal was a really great server. Very helpful, kind and friendly."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I have only eaten the lunch buffet which is good. I really enjoy the variety of food and the must have Mango Lassi drinks... Yummy!"}
{"text":"Worst Indian Food, I've eaten lot of buffets, I will rank this last.  I only liked the navaratan curry and naan, everything else is horrible"}
{"text":"Gandhi was recently shut down for a multi-generational cockroach infestation.   If you feed them, they will come. And these roaches had a feast.   Inspectors called the infestation \"excessively active\" and found the roaches housed inside an excessively greasy burner where food was actively cooking. Roaches were also in the prep area, near the sink and on the hot line.   Gandhi's own pest control reports showed the restaurant requires a complete clean-out to eliminate the roach problem.   We went by to see if any cleaning was going on.Their van was parked outside, but the restaurant's doors were locked.   The sign on the door says they're closed for remodeling, indicating someone should be doing something.  In addition to the roach infestation, inspectors also saw a food handler using expired, 11-day old tomato sauce to cook with."}
{"text":"This place is solid! We usually come for the lunch buffet because it's close to UNLV, but have recently tried the dinner menu and it was very yummy with a lot of options.   We've eaten here many times and always have received great service!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in the city. Authentic yet stylish. Must visit this place if you are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, terrible taste and very bad customer service. They will also add 18% gratitude even if it's just single family with 5 people! I do not recommend at all."}
{"text":"Outstanding food! Excellent service!  I'm glad we found this place.  I've been to many Indian restaurants. The owner personally came out to greet us and check on our experience."}
{"text":"Went to Gandhi India Cuisine eat Buffet dinner after Golf Tournament.  I do not eat meat, only seafood and Vegetables.  I had asked the owner make sure they had enough fish.  He did a great job and had best fish.  Crystal the Manager made the experience \"Awesome\"."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is fantastic as is the friendly service. My favorite is the chicken tikka masala. Located in a strip mall off the Strip, it's a nice change from the crowded casino restaurants. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We came in around 3pm and the place was empty - yay! We had it to ourselves.  We had lamb samosas for the appetizer, then my friend had a goat and spinach dish while I had a vegetable dish. We got naan instead of rice and it was pretty bomb. I enjoyed my friend's dish and she enjoyed mine, so we switched. Hers was creamy and the goat was very flavorful. Mine was a \"farmers\" dish with a sweet and spicy orange sauce. They were both delicious and mood-elevating.  The wait time for the food was very short and we watched Bollywood music videos in the meantime, which were fun and colorful.  We got a couple of mango lassis alongside the meal and finished with pistachio dessert. Everything tasted amazing.  The waitress was very nice and comped the dessert for us, which my struggling student's budget appreciated.  We'll definitely come again, it was worth the money."}
{"text":"The place was recommended by a friend who had visited Las Vegas 10 years ago. However, the place turned out to be really disappointed. I fail to understand how the restaurant has said open for 10 plus years. Curry was more watery, masala papad was super spicy (had to drink 2 glasses of water) & naan was rubbery. Would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"food is authentic, but giving 3 stars for the pushy service. the owner/manager tried to sell hard liquor when we were not interested. Also, he was right next to us to get the check signed....seemed desperate to get a good tip.   Tried their buffet as well, that was good & reasonable.  Would avoid this place as there are multiple other indian restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Vegas, i never miss Gandhi's lunch buffet.I am doing this from years now. I even had dinner here sometimes and it is not bad either. I like this place but don't expect anything outstanding. It is an average restaurant with good and tasty Indian food.  I recommend this place to everyone who are in search of a good meal after a exhausting day of fun in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great service the staff was very friendly and it was very clean and welcoming. The food was amazing in my opinion best Indian food in Vegas! I recommend getting the Tikka Marsala it was very good and flavorful."}
{"text":"Went for buffet lunch. The food is ok and reasonable. The variety is good (maybe a dish or two more for the vegetarians needed). Decor is ok. Adult price is 11.95 and Kids is 8.95. Great for out-of-towners who crave Indian food."}
{"text":"Great place off the strip for delicious Indian food. The service was wonderful. My only complaint is the price. Very expensive considering everything is a la carte. They have a lunch special for $13 and I would return for that. Overall, if your looking for really good food with excellent service, this is your spot."}
{"text":"They illegaly isolated us from the main dining room because of my service dog. They put us in a large empty banquet room that had the AC and music blasting at uncomfortable levels, both of which are triggers to my medical condition.   When we asked why we were isolated from the other customers we were told it was an order from the boss. When I informed them that this was illegal as per ADA and state law they eventually moved us to the main dining room with the other customers, but were not apologetic about it.   The prices were pretty high too. I would not go back here."}
{"text":"Best Indian in Vegas - hands down. I grew up in Vegas but I live in Philly now (EKTA!)  and I've been around the world many times since. The vegetable pakora at Ghandi is still the best I've ever had and I always make sure to eat here when I'm in town."}
{"text":"My wife and I have tried only the lunch buffet, since they do not serve from the menu during lunch.  Maybe I have been spoiled by the excellent Indian food in and around San Francisco, i.e. Pakwan, Shalimar, and others. At any rate the food at Ghandi is mediocre and overpriced: $11.99 for the lunch buffet, loaded with bland vegetarian dishes and a few chicken-scrap entrees.  Oh, well, I may try another Indian restaurant in Las Vegas, though I may just wait until the next time I'm in San Francisco."}
{"text":"i can't believe this place had a banner outside calling it the \"best ethnic restaurant of las vegas.\"  i don't remember what year or what company judged this place, obviously the judges might have ate at this establishment years ago, or the judges had been starving...for days, so that anything tastes delicious.  prior to eating here, my party was suggested by other frequent patrons that this place was \"hella good!\" i was very disappointed because as i walked in I noticed the buffet line.  we were told that a la carte items were not offered, so that means the buffet food has been sitting out or possibly left overs from yesterday!  the tandoori chicken was so dry and unflavorful.  the lamb was full of flavor from all the spices but was just too tough.  a lot of the vegatable dishes had more cauliflower than expected (filler???)....so a lot of farting.  ooh, and that shredded carrot dessert...yech.  the only yummy thing was the tangy mango lassi.  im not sure if one of the dishes i had was palak paneer.  if it was, it didnt taste like what ive had before.    the decor of this place was so dated.  it was white walled with a high ceiling with a huge rug above you.  it was also very chilly inside.  the buffet line took away the appeal and decor of the place.  im assuming they went buffet style b/c of the lack of business.  it is a hard find with morton's and buca di beppo right smack in front of you.   i really do love indian food can somebody please help out here...is there a fantastic indian restaurant in las vegas?"}
{"text":"Delicious indian food you can find near the strip. Me and my husband simply love the buffet. I like having South Indian breakfast items with chicken curry .. So I took a serving of hot hot made upma with butter chicken curry  WOWW is the word !!!  I was so so so happy with the food that ..I badly wanted to leave a great feedback on yelp.. Hence created my yelp account. Isn't it crazy.. Food @ Gandhi definitely has that impact."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night. We walked in and it was pretty quiet. MP, the host, greeted us with a smile and sat us at a booth. He explained the menu and since I'm vegetarian he offered some good recommendations. Our appetizer came out rather quickly.  I had the ghandi tali. Everything on the tray was delicious. There was enough food on the tray for two people. Crystal our server came over several times to check on us, also very friendly. The thali also came with desserts. We tried the rice pudding and mango ice cream. Both good choices. Can't wait to come back and try the lunch buffet. We highly recommend this place if you're looking for authentic Indian food off of the Las Vegas strip. Be sure to check in on Yelp for a 10% off"}
{"text":"bit of a misfire. Should consider adding butter-free rice if they are going to have so many vegan dishes. Indian food without rice is too overpowering for most palates. Also, the waiter should not have argued with us that we didn't order our second dish and should have just said \"sorry about that, will bring it right out\". It's impossible for some people to fathom that they might be wrong or might not have heard something. It's ok to admit the possibility of fault... we're all only human."}
{"text":"Woman cannot live from liquor alone so at some point I had to eat.  Being a pissed off hungry vegetarian in a city catered to meat eaters, I began to feel aggressive.  Then I drove down Paradise Road and saw a sign that read Gandhi.   I remembered the concept of ahimsa all of a sudden, took a deep breath, and figured that the food gods were on my side.  I walked inside and saw meat on the plates of other patrons.  I was mildly annoyed since Gandhi was a vegetarian and I normally would have been a pain in the ass about it, but I was so desperate for food that I was willing to sacrifice my principles for the good of my stomach.  I asked the server if there were a few vegetarian dishes present at the buffet, and he smiled and proceeded to show me the goods.  After correctly guessing that I am from California (a vegetarian twenty-something with a serious sense of entitlement, where else could I be from?) I proceeded to eat this excellent, varied, and overpriced lunch, surrounded by friendly staff who were attentive but not overbearing.  I had such a great meal that I made my friends go there with me again the next day.  I highly recommend this place to vegetarian tourists."}
{"text":"I love this place!! So good! Great staff and some of the best around. Looks like a hole in the wall but delicious and love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food here is too spicy and the seating is limited. I dont like spending alot of money and have to wait to be seated."}
{"text":"Delivery was pretty quick especially for a large order. I'm impressed because I've never found an Indian restaurant that would deliver before and this one delivered faster than any pizza place in town!  Food was good. We had 5 different dishes and two desserts. Everything was better than average. Peas were missing from our rice but that's not a big deal. The Bryani was very good.   Thanks"}
{"text":"Way too expensive buffet for very less items and were tasting very bad. It was $25 per person and there were no special items like biryani. Sambar was tasting like it was made ages ago. Very disappointed. I would not recommend this. And all the labels to the dishes were placed wrong."}
{"text":"A hole-in-the-wall place.  Indian owned.  I like how when you walk in you feel like you are in a real indian restaurant, complete with a Hindu Elephant God statue there.  There were lots of indian customers eating there.    Food is ok, ~$12 bucks lunch buffet.  Def get the 15% off coupon from hotel magazines.  I don't really know my indian food, so hard to judge it's authenticity.  Not the best I've had, but def edible.  Naan bread, salad, tandori chicken, & sauces were good.  Skip on the curry."}
{"text":"Phenomenal North IndianFood, the best the city can offer. Not only does it fill your appetite but also warms your heart. Service is great and the team there pay close attention to customers. Don't miss out on this!!!"}
{"text":"I Love Gandhis! I've been there quite a few times and I have never had a bad experience. We usually visit during dinner, but we have also gone during lunch buffet. I prefer dinner because there is more options to order, but my husband enjoys having a visual so he likes the buffet. The food is great. I love the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Mango Lassi. I really just can't complain. It's our go-to for Indian cuisine.   I also really like what they've done with the place. It looks more put together."}
{"text":"I had a great experience when I ate here a few days ago. I started with the tandoori mix grill. This plate had a nice mix of chicken, lamb, and prawns. It all tasted great. For the main course we had the chicken tikka and the prawn curry. Both these dishes had just the right amount of spices and filled with taste.    If you have never tried Indian cuisine, make sure this is the 1st Indian restaurant you try. The food will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Best experience ever . Amazing service . Crystal the manager best customer service ever .  The food is amazing . Great ambiance .  I must say best Indian restaurant town .  I would definitely recommend this place to everyone one I know specially to my clients .  Regards   Kalpen"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Indian restaurants ever. The layout makes you feel at home and helps enjoy your experience. The staff is great and friendly.   The food is outstanding. The lamb was cooked to perfection which is hard to find. The menu offers a lot of variety for both meat eaters and vegetarians. I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Lunch Buffet is at the most average. Especially for vegetarians. When you don't have a vegetable pulav or biryani there isn't really much you can do to the buffet with not so great curries. There are no people to take out the remaining plates. This kind of takes the appetite away when the remaining plates are still on the table. The seating is also not so great with tables very close to each other. I was a regular here before but deeply disappointed with my recent visit. I would never go here again."}
{"text":"Best food I've had in Vegas so far. My boyfriend and I loved everything we had. I'm a vegetarian he's not. Our service was a bit spotty; we had to wait a good 15 minutes for our bill, and I never got the dessert that came with my meal after ordering it. I would rate this 5/5 if our service had been better. We beat the dinner rush thankfully. When we walked in there were only ten other customers; when we walked out, that number had at least tripled. The ambiance was intimate and the restroom was one of the cleanest I've seen in this city."}
{"text":"Worst indian buffet i have ever had. I had veg none of the dishes are good. Pakora was very hard. Sambar and idly horrible. Only thing i can able to eat without complaining was rice gheer and carrot halwa. My friends tried non veg, other thn  goat non of the dishes are good. One word i would say is OK. That to just for ambiance and desserts. Any my two stars for the ambience and def not for the food."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!  I love Indian food and I eat it whenever I can. This place is the best!  And Crystal (probably mispelled) is super friendly, super efficient and knowledgeable.  Ask for her!"}
{"text":"Food quality is Average service very slow v r waiting for water for 5 minutes we are coming for enjoying the Indian food but upset our mood because quality of food very below we never try this restaurant"}
{"text":"Decent ambience and courteous service topped the quality food out here. I came here ravaged with hunger and had a bhindi masala and two aloo parathas all to myself. The dishes were well made, and the aloo parathas lived up to the description. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for 3 days and one of my friend  insisted  on having  Indian food, like  we don't get enough  of it at home. We had buffet, nothing  was fresh and didn't  taste good at all. I have even tried one in Rio, even that was not good at all. I rather stick to my all time favorites  in central  valley"}
{"text":"Me and my friends came to Gandhi for lunch the food is amazing the staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is nice ! If you want amazing Indian food go to Gandhi!!!!"}
{"text":"My Indian friend recommended this place. Unfortunately, everything I ate there didn't taste good. I had one dish that had this orange sauce with so much cream in it that it made me nauseous. Also, their garlic nan bread was terrible. It was so thick, bready and dry with thick chunks of which tasted like uncooked garlic. I took one bite and tossed them all out. Why is it so hard to find good, flaky nan in the Vegas area??!! The worst thing was that it was ridiculously expensive for two things and nan it was $40. Outrageous! I did get a discount that dropped the priced to $30 something but still it definitely was not worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place fast lunch buffet and amazing food with an even better price tag!!!!!!  You can never go wrong here"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 16 years and the food and service are first class.  I am always greeted with a smile and friendly service.  If you want the best Indian cuisine in Las Vegas and the West Coast, then look no further.  Visit Gandhi's and you'll go no where else."}
{"text":"Don't go if you're looking for authentic Indian food. Got chicken biryani and asked for a spicy one. But instead got a tasteless rice which had dried grapes and cashews. Not a good choice if you're looking for authentic Indian."}
{"text":"I came here. Went home. And cried to my mom why i wasnt indian. For real tho, SO GOOD. best ik ndian food ive ever had. Nothing ive tried even compares. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Really great location. The tikka masala was creamy and hot and my husbands Bhuna was very flavorful.  The onion bhaji was a bit over cooked.   Overall the service was good and we were well looked after.  The prices were much more reasonable than Mint just down the street."}
{"text":"Food was ok nothing great as such to mention. Naan served on the table needs a mention as it was thin, crispy and not soggy. Good ambience, have parking place off the strip. Good if you are driving in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ohhh myyy agahhh.   Ghandi has this lunch buffet that you cannot beat. Sometimes I daydream about the food the next day (that's not normal for me). Sometimes I will think about who would be willing to go with me for Sunday lunch. I can assure you that EVERY single person I have ever introduced to Indian food by taking them here has begged me to go back immediately. If you've never had indian food, its the perfect place to start because you can pick and choose. It's addicting and you can't really beat the price for a buffet of about $12 per person. The food is so flavorfuls and there is always a ton of variety to choose from.   The outside is nothing to write home about, located in a sketchy parking lot area but inside its like a beautiful indian palace of deliciousness. The service is nice. Like the cashier makes jokes sometimes that I don't immediately understand, but then eventually I do."}
{"text":"Looking for good Indian restaurant in Las Vegas for years, we finally found \"THE ONE\".  Everything about \"Gandhi\" is good (maybe location is a little farther than I would like)..  Decor: rich dark colors, very spacious rooms. Food: EXCELLENT! Papadom (compliments of the chef). Light crispy, not overly spicy. For starters we ordered Paneer Pakora. Very good seasoned excellent appetizer. Mulligantawny soup. Be prepared to unusual preparation, not what  you would expect, but very good.  Entries: Chicken Tikka Masala OMG!! Best Tikka Masala I ever had Fish Korma. This dish is not on a menu, but I asked if it would be possible to prepare it for us. That's another big STAR to Gandhi restaurant. Every our request was  accommodated. They try to make your dinner a real \"experience\". Which gives a great feeling of being taken care of.    Back to entries Eggplant Bharta. We asked to make it mild. Well.. you can not really make this dish mild it is meant to be spicy..But hey managed. Funny.. mild on a beginning it gives you a \"kick\"  a couple of sends later. We actually asked to make another one like it, so we can take it home! Naan. Excellent. Another item we ordered more for take out, we enjoyed later.  Prices: Surprisingly inexpensive. The portions are quite big. We ordered Mango Lassie, which was twice the size of any lassie we had before, price however was $3.50?  I almost was ready to say to our waiter that this is to cheap, and they should raise the price (but, of course I  did not say anything)  Overall great restaurant. If you get a chance stop here and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"My trip to Vegas is not complete without the fountains at the Bellagio, the lions at MGM and a few other places that I can't mention here. :-) But last but not the least is Gandhi India Cuisine's exquisite lunch buffet. I've been to Vegas (for various reasons :-)) 5-6 times and had lunch at this restaurant. Don't get me wrong, I am sure there are people who prefer the wide spread buffets at the casinos, but this one is no less.   The food is well cooked and the arrangement is nice. The price is, if I still remember, $10...all you can eat. Isn't that sweet? Its about a mile or so from the strip in a strip mall.   Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this place for several years.  My trips to Las Vegas are not complete until I've visited the buffet.  The quality has been the same all the time, the taste has always been great, and the people there are very friendly.  I don't frequent an indian restaurant in Los Angeles as much as I have in Las Vegas.  Looking forward to more food next time I go."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with Gandhi's! The food is amazing, full of flavor and always filling. Not to mention the service is great. I rave about this place to everyone. Anytime we have a friend in town we take them here. My boyfriend and I make it a point to dine here at least once a month. I can never get enough of it. We have never been disappointed with the food or the service. If you don't live near the strip (we live 20 minutes away) it's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"The food is very good. And staff is very friendly and helpful and the food cost is fair food is very delicious. I was order tandoori mix grill it's amazing it's my favorite place for India food I went lot of there and food tasted great..."}
{"text":"Very clean and hygienic! Love the ambience and openness. Much better than overcrowded restaurants right on the strip.   Service is awesome. Waiters are very kind, always available and seem to want you to ask them for things.   Food is absolutely amazing. I've never had better Indian food in my life. Tastes very fresh. Chicken dishes are very juicy and succulent. Other Indian restaurants just don't match up to the quality of food.  I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. My Vegas trip was complete after coming here.  I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The tomato soup was out of the world. The most delicious I ever had. Better than many restaurents in India !"}
{"text":"Found out this place was featured on dirty dining on fox five. Won't be returning. I liked the food but after reading about the health code violations, I'm not longer impressed nor convinced that this is the place for me."}
{"text":"I had the lunch buffet which was easily the worst Indian buffet I have been to in a while. The place is not kept well, the water jugs look like they haven't been washed forever, the 'silverware' is cheap plastic coated to look like silver, and the food is pathetic. I am already beginning to feel my tummy grumble. Our server had a friendly face and was polite and courteous. That's what stops me from giving this place one star but that's not reason enough to eat here again.  I see a lot of 5* reviews about the food so I was forced to think what I missed. Probably the chef or something else has changed, but as it stands now, this is a no-go."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant with my wife. Both of us liked a food a lot especially daal and potato beans. Highly recommended if you visit Las Vegas and also price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Crystal was an amazing server! She gave us fantastic recommendations for vegan dishes and was very pleasant and attentive. The food was absolutely amazing but we are definitely coming back more because of her incredible service. Best Indian restaurant in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Pretty good foods and good guy. I really happy. ????????????????? Very good food, very good owner, Rajinder-san."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a couple of co-workers.  The building was a bit outdated, but that just adds more history to the place, since it has been here in Vegas for a long time.  I ordered the chicken tandory (my favorite).  I've also tried the chicken cury from my co-worker's plate.  The food is very good and is as authentic as it can get.  I love eating food from a places that has exotic and authentic cruisines.   I also love the Indian beer as well.  Forgot the name of the beer but it was very good."}
{"text":"Have been here many times before but this time had the worst experience!! When we discussEd an  issue with the Manager, he was so rude with us . Will never visit this restaurant again To add this this place has been rated as the dirtiest place In Fox News !!"}
{"text":"We had the buffet here last week, sambhar was very spicy, chole was swimming in oil and wasn't great either. Pakodas were really soft and looked like malnourished children from Somalia. Normally in  a buffet you have at least 3 veggie curry options 2 eat curry options, 2 appetizers. This one only has 2 veggie curry options, 1 appetizer. I had dined here 10 years ago and food was pretty decent, not sure what happened now.."}
{"text":"Lots of tasty vegetarian dishes even though I'm a meat lover, I was quite surprised that the lunch buffet was more than enough. Spices were just right, flavorful and a plethora of dishes including dessert. I would have given it a 4-star but the location and atmosphere needs improvement. Be prepared to walk away satisfied and extremely full."}
{"text":"I want to give minimum possible star! Horrible food, worst customer service. While eating the dinner buffet, I have been asked twice. I mean guy couldn't see me eating the food. Tiniest Bowl I have ever seen at this place. You can't even take out the curry with a spoon out of that bowls. Please  don't waste your money at this place."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in until the moment you leave you feel like family! The food is phenomenal! I didn't think I cared for Indian food but this place is so delicious!!! There isn't one thing on the menu I've had and not fully enjoyed!!! One of the best restaurants in Las Vegas! This is a must try!!! You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Nice ambient as well. Lunch buffet has many veg options. They did ran out of idly and when we requested they made it but took some time. Same with naan, you can as for garlic naan but it will take some time meanwhile you will have a plate of rice with you just in case you can't wait."}
{"text":"Buffet had very limited options and the price was sky high.. surely the most expensive buffet that I have come across in US in the past 5 years !!! 20 dollars for a buffet with the options they had was absolutely not worth it. If you are looking at value for money, this is NOT the place."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and always fresh. I go here a couple times a week for lunch, since my office is just around the corner. Always friendly and attentive service."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Indian food this is a great restaurant. I've eaten at several Indian restaurants in the valley and this is by far my favorite. I only gave 4 stars because sometimes the staff doesn't pay proper attention to the tables. However, that has never deterred me from visiting this restaurant time and time again."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in town + the setting / decoration of this place is stylish n modern ! Luv it :)"}
{"text":"Tried veg biryani there!!! Lot of stuff and masala curd in appropriate price. Must try place for Indian food in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Driving down flamingo and saw a couple of Indian food joints. Ghandi had an authentic feel.  After going inside and seeing a buffet style set up, I was a little thrown off. After asking the lady, she explained you can either do the buffet or order off the menu.   I decided to stay because there were so many people there.......the food was so good. So good that I went back for dinner the same night. For dinner I ordered off the menu (there is no buffet at night anyways.) and I cannot believe the results.   The food off the menu was even better than the buffet (which was already some of the best Indian food I've had.) I will be eating here every chance I get every time i'm in vegas.  Favs: Chicken Masala, Lentil Soup, Basmati Rice, Garlic Naan, the dessert @ Buffet  ;-) (make sure to combine them!)"}
{"text":"This place got one of the best food you can find in the area. Lot of items to choose from and every item got best taste to it. Customer service is also really good. If you are in the area, you should definitely stop by and check this place out"}
{"text":"How dissapointing. We came back after the owner and manager spoiled us last time. We walk in, the front man Paul doesn't even acknowledge us, is totally rude and obviously hates his job or life, it was a misserable experience. We ordered garlic nan. It came out plain and dry. We asked for the manager, Paul told us she was eating and walked away. I had to get up after 5 min"}
{"text":"\"Well, now we know why it was totally empty,\" my boyfriend said as we walked to our car after dinner here. We went in because I caught sight of it out of the corner of my eye while driving by and hadn't heard of it. That should have been a warning sign but instead I took it as an opportunity. Unfortunately, this spot was very disappointing: overpriced and subpar.  Interior is well decorated and the high ceilings are nice, unexpectedly nice considering the strip-mall exterior. Menu prices are a bit high with most dishes ~$20. This would be okay if portions were larger or if rice was included, as at most Indian restaurants.   We ordered the goat curry, saag paneer, and garlic naan- all dishes we love and get regularly. The goat was among the toughest I've ever had, the paneer was flavorless, and even the naan was rather lacking. Dishes were brought out in small bowls without rice, which was not offered or mentioned in any way to indicate that it was not included, and had to be requested. Our bill was about $50 for mediocrity, but they do offer a 10% off Yelp check-in discount."}
{"text":"Rrally awesome food. Malai paneer was excellent and butter naan was too good. Even lassi was great too."}
{"text":"Worst food we had in Vegas. Couple of my friend had stomach ache after  eating here. Also for the price its not worth. Will not recommend anybody to go here. Also the parking lot was empty. Now we know why it was empty."}
{"text":"Lunch Buffet was very crowded on the weekend--long line, but water/drink service was still good.  A wide variety of food--nan was actually out in the buffet line which was nice to see done.  Only thing was the plastic utensils bothered me.  I could live with the plastic water cups but plastic forks and spoons seem like picnic items and eating tandori chicken with them proves difficult.  I was glad to see a well stocked buffet even with such a crowd!  Good food- but not the best to bring me back often-mango lassi was okay too."}
{"text":"Had dinner a la carte here. For me, more than the food, it was eating here that mattered. Because, they filmed a major indian movie (tamil language movie) called Jeans (yes, the name of the movie is in English). This movie starred the beauty Aishwarya Rai. If she had visited here, then, me too wanna visit!! Food was not bad at all. But, Tamba was way better (i think they are the same owners)."}
{"text":"I may return, I may not. It was a rainy day, and they were serving buffet. They told me flat out I couldn't order off the menu and had to eat the buffet. I really didn't get that. They were empty and you'd think that they would want to accomodate any business they can get.   So, hopefully, some day I'll get a chance to order off the menu and write a real review. In short, the service bit the big one and they weren't very helpful.  Maybe next time..."}
{"text":"Tasty food and wide varieties for buffet. However some dishes are very oily. We are vegetarian so my review is for veg dishes. Dry mixed veg subzi was very good. Dal makhni was tasty. Simple dal can have little less spice. Biryani was tasty but greasy.  Veg Pakodas weren't cooked inside. But overall buffet spread was good."}
{"text":"[Review is for the lunch buffet]  Not the best buffet in Vegas and not the cheapest (running about $12.95), but you can expect some good spice from the buffet options.  What sets Gandhi India Cuisine's buffet aside from other Indian buffets in Vegas is the surprising spice.  The general tendency in an Indian buffet is to keep it bland.  The buffet has to make a lot of different palates happy and the general tendency is to keep it bland to make the most folks happy.  But cheers to Gandhi for not skimping on the spice.    They usually have several vegetarian options in the buffet and a number of delicious chicken dishes.  There's some real hit and miss going on with the dishes.  I loved the paneer in spicy butter cream and the chicken tikka masala.  And thumbs up for the naan and the okra dish.    That said, many of the dishes simply fall flat.  Problem is, at $12.95, this is one of the more expensive non-strip buffets and it is simply just not spectactular."}
{"text":"The food was good, first time trying Indian cuisine. The staff was very nice and made sure we were satisfied. Plan on going back"}
{"text":"One of worst Indian restaurants. Served food which might have been in the freezer for a while. We went to lunch buffet sweet rice and chicken curry are out of freezer for sure. They charged $13 per person for that.   PLEASE DO NOT GO...."}
{"text":"Love the ambience here! Food is just ok, we had buffet here. The food was not so fresh and hot. The owner was generous and nice man."}
{"text":"The dinner buffet had a variety of options for vegetarian and non-vegetarian. The food was good but some dishes could have been better. The Chai was my favorite part. Definitely will recommend to others who are visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"I love their food but...service is sometimes lacking.    Went last week to the lunch buffet, as soon as we sat down they asked what type of naan we wanted and had it to us almost before we finished getting our first plate from the buffet line. They even made us a dish that wasn't on the buffet line.  Only issue I had was that we had to refill our own water.  Went again today and I don't know what it was but maybe the boss wasn't around.  After sitting down with our first plate and finishing about half of it we finally had to ask if we were getting any naan and to do that we had to interrupt the waiters cell conversation.  When the naan came five minutes later it was somewhat burnt which I don't really care about but the person I was with didn't really care for.   We arrive well before the end of the lunch buffet but shortly after we sat down they started prepping the other tables for dinner, kind of made it feel like there was a rush for us to finish.  Again we had to get our own water refills.  To top it off, after we were most of the way done with our lunch we were told that they couldn't take cards today, cash only, I had to dig around to find enough to cover it, would have been nice if we were told that before we started."}
{"text":"We ordered biryani with a medium spice level. It was extremely hot and we were not able to eat it. Also we ended up paying 20$ for it. Not worth the price."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and so far the best indian restaurant in Las Vegas. Long weekends they always have Lunch and Dinner buffet which is fabulous and their food is awesome as well.   Whenever we come to Vegas we just eat here. We are vegetarians and they always have lot of options for us compare to other restaurants.  We love this place and recommend to all vegetarians indian food lovers :)"}
{"text":"And the food quality is not good and the price is too high, suggest you go somewhere else and get what your moneys worth... Don't go for the buffet."}
{"text":"We ordered for kadai paneer and gobi paratha / onion kulcha... Kadai paneer gravy was watery and no taste... Gobi paratha didn't yield any taste too.... Not satisfied with food ..."}
{"text":"Small quaint restaurant.  Authentic Indian food. Impressive selection of dishes, Buffett style.    Tastes wonderful.  Friendly service and great prices."}
{"text":"If for nothing else, stop in here and get a hot tea... No joke. They are $3.50 and spiced like no tea in Las Vegas. Cardamom and stuff, who cares what's in it, just get some!  The food was great too, a bit pricey but hey :)"}
{"text":"Has a great ambiance to this place with high ceilings and soft lighting. Service is good.  Buffet was disappointing with few choices and food didn't taste all that fresh.   Felt the price was a bit high for what was offered."}
{"text":"If you are ever in Vegas and looking for authentic Indian food, you must check out this place. The chicken tikka masala we had last night was absolutely out of the world. Also, if you are a masala tea fanatic like I m - you will find that perfect cup here!"}
{"text":"Very good food, my husband and I both liked it. So flavorful!! The only thing is that my mushroom mutter was a bit too spicy for me, but I added some plain rice to it and that was good. I'd recommend this place to put a note that it's spicy, on the menu. The best service ever! I felt like I was in some VIP exclusive restaurant. Very polite and well mannered servers! The service was literally the best.  I'd definitely come back here"}
{"text":"This is the best tasting Indian food in Las Vegas. I've always thought the service was polite but frosty. I don't care though. The taste is what brings me back. I don't live nearby, but if something takes me to this area I'm thinking about Ghandi!"}
{"text":"Poor service. Waiters don't come to the table for over 20 minutes. You have to constantly beckon them for service - whether it is to take your order or bring the condiments or fill the glass of water or bring the check. And the place wasn't even crowded. Only 4 tables were occupied. Food is of sub standard quality. The lamb biryani had tough lamb that was undercooked and extremely hard to chew. The goat dish was full of bones. The chicken dish was tasteless. Never going back there. This link says it all:  http://www.ktnv.com/news/dirty-dining/dirty-dining-health-district-moves-to-permanently-close-gandhi-indias-cuisine"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service. We visit this place every time we are in vegas. But on Dec 24th they only had dinner buffet and when we told the manager (Laddi) we were leaving cause we couldn't order our favorite dish (malai paneer) he had the kitchen make it for us!! We felt so special and taken care of!! U guys gotta try this place! U wont be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Never name a restaurant after a person that was famous for fasting. If you happen to eat at this dump that's decorated to be some type of indian EDM dance club, you will probably end up like Ghandi and want to fast for the next several days. The one and only waiter was so big and tough looking and acting that it seemed like he should have been a Sultan's bodyguard instead of in the customer service business. What I want to say is that this guy is the world's worst waiter but is so intimidating that I wouldn't dare complain about it (to his face). Their prices are too high for low quality food. We ordered two very different dishes and they tasted almost identically the same. I hate this fucking place. I hope their tandoori oven melts this papadum shack off the face of the earth. Fuck you!"}
{"text":"Service poor. Food was old stock that was reheated . Some portion of Eggplant potato curry was too hot and some of it too cold. Pakoras were uncooked inside. Nan was never served. Rest was less than ordinary. Save your stomach and money"}
{"text":"Food Quality is too bad. No service. No ventilation. This place used to be much better but now it's not worth."}
{"text":"wow. such an upgrade since i used to spend countless lunch buffets with coworkers, back in the day when i used to work in the howard hughs pkway offices... i took my wife there for lunch just last week.  the GRUB: - chutneys and sauces galore - plenty of your veggie favorites: stewed chick peas, saag paneer (spinach with cheese), curry potatoes and peas, fried onion dumplings, and other dishes - all delicious - meat too - tandori grilled chicken, chicken tikka, butter chicken, etc. - got bread and carbs? basatmi rice, naan, rice cakes, spicy noodle dish, samosas... all good. - dessert: mango custard with fruit, fried brown sugar pastries in a sugary syrup sauce, and fresh fruit - yummy. - hot tea, coffee, mango lassi, sodas and juices available.  the JOINT: - such a turn around from when i used to frequent years back... the white table clothes have been replaced by all wood tables covered by fancy black linens... the open balcony now houses private dining areas perfect for parties that want an intimate booth... even the buffet section is granite counter tops with built in buffets - fancy. much fancier than the old tables with the buffet heat trays... - indian decor - many intricate paintings and woodwork abound, including a huge wooden hand carved goddess at the entry... floor to ceiling curtains and fabrics of india surround you. very nice. - plenty of seating - clean and upscale (especially for a buffet)  the SQUEEZE: - friendly and attentive service as always. - about $25 per person for lunch - a little pricey. - cash and card accepted  the FINAL SAY: my wife and i enjoyed our lunch buffet, and it kept us full for most of the day... and for me, it was such a pleasant surprise to see that the owner has done so much to upgrade on such a great indain buffet restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to ghandi tonight for the first time. Great looking restaurant, and the food was delicious , but more importantly the customer service was outstanding. best indian restaurant in vegas. You gotta check it out for yourself!!"}
{"text":"The service was probably the worst I have ever had. My server never said a single word to my table the entire time we were there. We were never asked if we wanted anything to drink or anything, very very strange.  I do not think the parking is sketchy, it is Vegas folks, it is a city, get over it.   Decor/music was rather odd...I liked it personally, but was far from what I would consider \"Indian.\"  Buffet food was ok, but rather bland. All of the dishes tasted as if they had used the exact same recipe. The spice level was non-existent which is a deal breaker for me and Indian food."}
{"text":"Came across this place when I visited Las Vegas just before Christmas and wanted to find a place to have Indian food. Ordered a Chicken Biryani carryout order since dinner buffet was almost on the verge of completion. Let me explain here - I am a food lover and can instantly say by the look of Indian restaurants on what kind of food to expect. There are different versions of \"authentic\" indian cuisines floating around and I must say this is not one of them. Biryani was sweet (authentic biryani is NEVER sweet) with cashew and raisins.  Good luck with this place."}
{"text":"For years every time I travel to Las Vegas, I must eat at Gandhi. It is a good stop for vegetarians like me.  Good naan, daal and mutter pulao."}
{"text":"Love this place, just wish I could afford to eat here more. Its not too pricey, its just a wee bit above my budget. They should have more specials maybe a coupon. Best chai I've ever had and the vegintarian menu is huge. Absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"I wasn't looking for Indian food, I was looking for CVS, so I could get some Excedrin for my headache.  But I turned into the wrong stripmall, and passed Gandhi.  No, not that Gandhi, he's dead.  Gandhi the restaurant.  What caught my attention were the people.  Dozens of Indian people headed into the restaurant.  Hmm.  \"Best of Las Vegas\" proclaimed the banner.  In this place?  What the heck, my last Vegas review was Fatburger, let's diversify a bit.  The restaurant itself is well appointed, clean, comfy.  Check. Lots of people on the buffet line.  Is there a buffet tonight?  No, they said, that's just for the private party.  Which turned out to be a BUSLOAD of Indian people.    No matter.  I looked at the menu, and ordered one of their combo dishes, along with a large Flying Horse.  Within minutes, complimentary papadum arrived, along with a tamarind sauce and a cilantro sauce.  To my surprise, the papadum were awesome.  Hot, crisp, tasty.  The sauces were excellent as well.  The combo arrived and the food continued to impress.  I haven't had Indian food this tasty and authentic since I was back in NY.  One thing I disliked was the dish - a metal plate with compartments which reminded me of a TV dinner.  I would have preferred to see several small plates, but I guess that would be more work.  The combo included a choice of dessert, and I passed up my usual kheer in favor of a pistachio kulfi ice cream recommended by my server.  It was AMAZING, except for the spoon (see below).  Reading the other reviews, either they have improved dramatically, or perhaps I was the beneficiary of stumbling on this place on a night where they knew they had to have their A game on (or risk upsetting said busload of people).  I would award 4 stars, except that my napkin was slightly dirty, and the spoon accompanying my dessert was clearly dirty as well (as in the dishwasher didn't do a good job).  I left stuffed and content, aka, feeling very un-Gandhi-like."}
{"text":"Kinda marginal Indian food - why go here when you go down Paradise to Origin India which is GREAT. I went here a bunch of times before I found out about Origin for the lunch buffet and once for dinner. It's just basically a standard Indian place, but certainly nothing to write home about. Not bad, just not good. I'd keep looking."}
{"text":"I've been told this is some of the best Indian food in town.  Oh boy am I in trouble.  I miss good Indian food."}
{"text":"Worth finding! Great food, nice atmosphere and well looked after. Highly recommended. Tarka Dall was excellent and they serve red Kingfisher. Will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Our service was excellent . Our service was well delivered by our server Crystal. The atmosphere was very relaxing and the food was superbly delicious! If you love Indian food, this establishment should be one of your top priorities to come and visit."}
{"text":"It's was great food , i had paneer tikka , salted lassi ,chicken tikka masala , Garlic nann,in desert Mango kulfi , great costumer service its first Indian resturent in lasvegas , a lot celebrities viste there its my favorite Indian resturent in lasvegas"}
{"text":"best food close to strip  Not sure why there are only 3 stars for this place. they deserve 5 stars. I have had food at Tamba and other places, but this was the best period"}
{"text":"This place isn't as good as Orgin India (just down the street) or  India Palace (also just down the street), but you can do a lot worse.  We have dined here a few times (with our 1-year-old), and we had a great time.  The food is good--not stellar--but good.  It has what I consider to be a run-of-the-mill Americanized Northern Indian menu.  Typical selection of Indian beers.  Staff was very friendly.  Food was great quality.  Everything we have ordered has been good."}
{"text":"Looking for good Indian restaurant in Las Vegas .we finally found \"THE ONE\".  Everything about \"Gandhi\" is good (maybe location is a little farther than I would like)..  Decor: rich dark colors, very spacious rooms. Food: EXCELLENT! That's another big STAR to Gandhi restaurant. Every our request was accommodated. They try to make your buffet a real \"experience\". Which gives a great feeling of being taken care of.  Naan. Excellent. Another item we ordered more for take out, we enjoyed later.  Prices: Surprisingly inexpensive.  Overall great restaurant. If you get a chance stop here and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The food is delicious!  I am from India and the food was so authentic with the perfect use of spices - not too spicy, fresh, great ingredients.  Try it yourself, especially the fish.  It was yum!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service. The dude doesn't even know where the guest are seated. Allotted our table twice to others while we are grabbing the food from buffet."}
{"text":"From a shady looking, wrecked place from outside to a exquisite Ethnic Indian Loungish looking interiors this restaurant really did surprise me. We infact planned to turn around go elsewhere looking at it from outside, and we are glad not to have done that. The restaurant has a lotta potential to be turned into an Indian Nightclub/Lounge at night, thanks to their multiple rooms, multiple floors, Red interior decor and tall ceilings. We took the Lunch Buffet which I felt was kinda OK. The best part of all was the Tandoori Chicken. Delishhh...one of the best I've tried. The rest were passable. Their Mango Lassi was pretty good however. Overall I felt $12 aint a bad deal for a quick Indian Lunch quite close to the strip in a grand setting."}
{"text":"Don't be deceived by the outside.  This restaurant is located at the end of a strip mall.  There's a simple neon sign outside and when you walk in it's a bit frightening for a moment.  Then you turn the corner and see a beautiful restaurant-- not what you'd expect.  The ceilings are high, the tables have high backs so you have a little more privacy, there are rooms that have curtains that can be drawn, and it's dimly lit.  The food is very good and the prices are reasonable and can't compare to anything on the strip."}
{"text":"A great place to host a party. The staff was helpful and the manager crystal was fantastic and the food was great like always! definitely recommend coming here"}
{"text":"A fantastic restaurant with delicious food and a great atmosphere. The service is a bit on the slow side but I think that was more a result of how hungry we were  and less of a result of the service itself."}
{"text":"We came here on a family recommendation and we gave the place two separate tries; once for the lunch buffet and once for dinner, neither was particularly great.   Over all the ambiance was beautiful and the service was great, but if that were all it took to make a great restaurant we wouldn't be reading yelp reviews. The lunch buffet was underwhelming to say the least. Not a ton of options and what was there was cold and kind of flavorless. Dinner on the other hand tasted great, but made me and one of my companions ill.  Needless to say we won't be going back for a third try."}
{"text":"I have to take back my four stars review about this fine Indian cuisine, that make me every time happier. we recently went to the buffet on the labor day weekend and, it was amazing experience. The food selection was excellent and we had few items out of the regular menu. still love the service, also the place."}
{"text":"Located in a weird angled funky strip I came here to satisfy my Indian Food binge.  This restaurant is large and looks as if it hosts banquets and members of the community.    I have only had Indian at one other restaurant. Gandhi  does offer a wide variety of dishes. There are over 10 vegetarian entrees.  There are some nans and  baked breads I have never seen before and I love the breads.  My friend had Tandoori prawns which even in San Francisco I don't see at all.    There are a few dishes I will order next time just for the sheer fact I can't find these dishes at home."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. You won't be sorry if you go. But you will be sorry when your friends tell you how delicious it is and you don't go. Plus Crystal, one of the servers is amazing."}
{"text":"Whoever gave this place more then one star has never eaten Indian food before! The food was very bland, and expensive, $30 for 2, including 2 soft drinks for a lunch buffet. Besides being very bland there was a serious issue of meat!!! There was almost none, just a little bit of chicken in their dishes, and the tandoori chicken left a lot to be disired. Thats it, no beef somosas or lamb or goat!  This was my second time here, the first was 10yrs ago, sadly the place hasn't improved..."}
{"text":"When we entered the restaurant, the buffet time was almost over. Erik kept the buffet on hold for us and even arranged for fresh and hot roti. Totally adds a star to our trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and service was great!!! Next time we are back in town we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Tasty food and good ambience and welcoming host. Liked the veggie pakoras and baingan bharta"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating Indian food. I know love eating since good experience now. I had the rogan josh , aloo gobi and Nam. Great flavor of a curry spices. Excellent service owner is friendly.  Also try the Mango Lassi so refresh taste.  If anyone wants to try Indian food for the first time this is a must."}
{"text":"I had the south India combo! My advice is to share it ! It's a huge plate. Food was great and very authentic. Service was a bit slow but it didn't affect my food experience."}
{"text":"This review is for the lunch buffet only.    I've never been dissappointed.  Well, that's not true.  I'm on the verge of tears when they run out of naan, which is a frequent occurrence for the lunch buffet.  But, it's one of my favored lunchtime stops.  Plenty of vegeterian options, and they have enough variety that it's rarely same combination of dishes.  They really won me over with their okra dish... Magnificient!  Muah!  That's what sticks out in my head the most, so I guess the rest is good but not necessarily spectactular.  It is in a somewhat seedy strip mall, but heck, some of Vegas' greats share that characteristic, Lotus of Siam anyone?  Interior decor I find quite pleasing.  The lunch buffet will run you around $12.50, so middle of the road pricewise, too.  I think this belong on your list if you're racking up your checklist of Vegas' Indian buffets."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch buffet and excellent service. I've tried all the chicken dishes and they are scrumptious. The potato dish is wonderful. The interior will make you feel like you're in a restaurant in Delhi."}
{"text":"I would never suggest this restaurant to anyone. We ordered chicken biryani, butter chicken and garlic nan and asked all of it to be spicy. Biryani is tasteless and it has raisins in it which made the taste worse. Chicken doesn't feel good at all. Big NO."}
{"text":"Well, I'm sad to review that Gandhi is no longer what it used to be. Not sure what may have changed but, I unfortunately won't be eating there any time soon. I used to eat here often as I love Indian food. The buffet was plentiful and always fresh. Now, its not so fresh and the food hardly has any flavor.  I remember just salivating at the anticipation of going there for lunch as everything was so good!! Now, instead all I had to look forward to was an upset belly once I got back to the office.  The salad that used to be crisp and fresh is now wilted and soggy. The tomatoes, well, what can I say except \"nasty\".  I'm sad that this happened as I loved going to Gandhi but, until I hear otherwise I won't be back for a long while if at all.  I guess Mt. Everest Indian Restaurant will be receiving my business now."}
{"text":"My fiance and I were on a mini-vaca for the weekend. We had just gotten out of a UNLV game and had no idea where to eat. We didn't want to go back on the busy strip and came across Gandhi. I love Indian food and haven't seemed to find any I like since leaving Sacramento for Arizona.       We were there for holiday and so the restaurant was strictly buffet, which the owner said is not usually the case. The assortment of foods was the best I've seen on any buffet. Plenty of options for meat eaters and vegetarians alike. Everyone was friendly, in fact in some cases they were a little too on top of their game. Perhaps checking in on us a little too much.       We knew from the moment we walked in a saw the place packed that we were at the right spot. I will be back there and only wished I lived closer."}
{"text":"Food tastes great, even better customer service and great atmosphere. They also have buffet and its great value for the price."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Ghandi! I have been going to this restaurant for the last 7 years for their lunch buffet. Every visit is always better than the last and the food tastes amazing.  I even met the owner today and he was a very nice and humble man. All in all, I love it."}
{"text":"After a week of all you can eat in Vegas, what do you do next? Have AYCE Indian food of course. Back in college, my buddies and I would always swing by Gandhi India Cuisine at the end of each visit to Vegas. Nothing cures a hang over like nice buttery, saucy, and oiling Indian food :). It really isn't that disgusting when eating it.   Brian from Family Guy describes Indian food as...(Brian is so hungry he eats Stewie's diaper.) \"Hey, at least its better than Indian food.\" That's exactly how I feel. Indian food quality is always hit or miss. If you cannot stomach \"ethnic\" foods, I don't recommend trying Indian food, but if you have a taste for adventure and have a strong stomach then try it. I love garlic Naan and curry chicken. There are a lot of other items and sauces that I'm not sure what they are, but they taste delicious. Be warned you will have a food coma after your Gandhi experience.   The restaurant is family owned and servers make you feel at home. I went a few times with Indian friends to help explain what everything is to me. This place is hard to find. It is near Terrible casino and behind a Morton's Steakhouse restaurant I think...near a massage parlor just off the strip. I think the way I first discovered this place was through a coupon in a Las Vegas magazine. My friends were semi-serious about going. It was a very hot day and our car broke down right in the same plaza. Call it fate or luck. I don't believe in luck. In Vegas, its ALL SKILL."}
{"text":"Omgeeee...This has to be the most authentic Indian restaurant I've ever been too! We came to celebrate a friends birthday and the service and atmosphere was supurb. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The lamb stew was exceptional and the stuffed Nan bread was amazing. The house red wine was a great pair with the tandoori chicken. Had a great meal in a comfortable and cozy setting. Will definitely come back with friends and family."}
{"text":"Amazing food and ambience. If you are in vegas and looking for indian food then this is the place to go. Buffet is good as well. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was just so-so including the service.   Nothing was really bad but nothing stands out.  Had decent lamb vindaloo (asked for extra spicy but not so spicy), chickent tikka masala, malai kofta and a couple different naans- which weren't that great.    Still looking for a good cheap-eats Indian in Vegas.  This place is a little pricey though not as ridiculously overpriced as Gaylords.  If your craving decent Indian food and not afraid to spend a couple bucks then this place should fit the bill."}
{"text":"Whenever I visit Vegas, i make sure to stop by Gandhi! the food here is delicious and the service is as amazing. They offer a balanced menu of both vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes, both of which are to die for. my favorite would have to be the butter chicken and naan. The lamb chops as appetizers are delicious as well.   Food aside, I definitely want to point out their excellent service and decor. the waiters are attentive and cater to all your needs. The decor is very ancient india inspired with a touch of modernity. . I would definitely say the look is quiet upscale and the prices are affordable. If you want authentic indian cuisine and a comfortable setting then look no further. Gandhi is the place for you."}
{"text":"The scenery is pretty nice here. From the outside, you can't see much and the place looks secluded, but once you're inside, the place is actually pretty nicely decorated inside. Food here was decent. I still feel like India Palace had better food just because the food was hotter. Then again, that might just depends on when they run out of food and have to put new ones in. I would say Ghandhi has more selection on food. It was just a little disappointing since they didn't have that popular chicken dish I like. Service was fine."}
{"text":"Food was amazing very authentic and staff was amazing! Our waitress Christina made it even better. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for something new and unique."}
{"text":"Gandhi features a very solid Indian lunch buffet that can sometimes miss the mark slightly depending on the particular variety they put out for the day and how well it matches your personal preferences.  The location isn't the greatest, inside a rather nasty East Flamingo strip mall next to a cigar shop, but they do a good job of making you forget this once you enter the establishment."}
{"text":"We went two times there for buffet. Our first visit was horrible experince, their staff is not so courteous and friendly. When it comes to food, it is average not so good. That day their staff was in hurry to kick us out without letting us to finish our food. Never be treated like that. We decided not to come to this place ever.   But because of our friend's food desperation and also went through with two other indian resturants(seeing long waiting lines), we have ended up here again during xmas2017 visit. Our bigest mistake was we did not ask the buffet price, thinking it will be normal charges ranging min $12 to max. $15.  Food was very good on that day specially bhindi masala/okra curry was tested freshly made eventhough we arrived at 1:00pm. May be they were out of other curry and replaced with this. Anyway most of buffet dishes veg. and non veg. were very tasty except naan as usual buffet naan never taste good in most of places but that was ok for us. Incident happen when my husband was eating his samosa with green chutney and he found green wire in green chutney(one we use to close plastic bags in store), we informed to waiter and he said ok ok i will let kitchen staff know, nothing else. Thinking that how horribly they manage and care in the kitchen. Although overall food was great, so we neglected that incident, and also their service. but when they charged us $20 per person for our buffet plus added gratuity where service was zero, we were stunned (unethical business behavior).  Request to owner  * Please keep eyes on your staff how they treat your customers, our both experience were horrible. * Courteous behavior in food industry is very much needed.  * Make place little bit spacious so other people's chair don't stuck on the way when we go to serve ourselves from buffet * In second trip, buffet was ridiculously overpriced, please don't change the price in order to take advantage of holiday season. Its not ethical. * being generous, gave one star is only for the chef who work hard in the kitchen o/w youguys don't deserve even one star..."}
{"text":"Awesome food. We came here for buffet, such a wide variety of snacks, entrees and deserts. Everything tasted so good. I will highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Crystal (and only crystal) was a great server! We ordered a huge selection and enjoyed almost everything, a few dishes could have been a little more spicy but the flavors were still great. Thanks for making my first Indian meal a delicious one."}
{"text":"My first time here. I was actually on my way to a different Indian restaurant and saw this one along the way thought I'd give it a try since I'd never been here. Anyway food was good the staff was friendly. I got a lot of containers for my buffet to go :) they had quite a bit of vegetarian options and some vegan. My craving is satisfied!"}
{"text":"Good value for your buck. Very close to the strip."}
{"text":"Awesome food as always... Buffet is really good and have plenty of choices.. Thanks aj"}
{"text":"Delightful lunch buffet with many options. Don't let the plain exterior fool you; the interior is gorgeous with high ceilings, mood lighting and lovely colors. Naan is delivered to the table; choices on the table the day we visited included many sauces, many vegetarian dishes, oranges, pakora (yum!), two options that included paneer, and three different chicken options. I thought it was delicious and appreciated the variety of flavors."}
{"text":"This place was on a recent episode of dirty dining. Currently under revocation by the Health District of Nevada for varios infractions of pest infestation meaning multiple generations of roaches. This was an episode from Fox 5 on March 3rd."}
{"text":"We've been going here for years and today was very likely the last time, sad to say. The parking lot was surprisingly empty and I guess we now know why. My wife normally loves the tandori chicken but today it was EXTREMELY dry and unedible. We told our waiter about it and he takes the piece of dry chicken from our table and takes it to the back kitchen and seemed to tell the cook that the chicken was bad. Well, no follow up, no apology and he seemed to laugh it off with the female waitress that seemed to be flipping the dry pieces, just picking at them. I've kind of noticed the food was getting lower in quality lately, but didn't say much since it was my wife's favorite Indian lunch buffet. Even the solidly prepared mango lassi was full of ice pieces, didn't taste good and didn't arrive to the table until my plate was nearly finished. I didn't even go for seconds, since there really wasn't anything worth going back for. We have other choices for Indian food and next time it won't be here. Maybe they changed owners?"}
{"text":"Overall, I thought this place was fine. I liked the decor, and the high ceilings. I liked the food. The bathroom was clean and nice.  I don't know, man..... I just don't really know what else to say. This place was just average I guess. I was there for the lunch buffet and to repeat Misti Y., it did seem like for what they offered combined with freshness level, it was a tad pricey. I did think the food tasted really good, and I liked the vegetarian dishes and both dessert options. They had a carrot/raisin pudding and a sweet rice noodle/coconut pudding. Mixed together, it was so friggin' GOOD!   Now here's the major bummer. One of my favorite things is Indian \"Nan\" bread. I was NOT feein' this place's nan (at least, not on the buffet). It's supposed to be somewhat fluffy and soft. This place's nan seemed like it had sat out too long or something, because it was flat and pretty hard in places. It was disappointing, because it is meant to be ripped up and used to scoop up the yummy rice and curry mix with your hands. I couldn't even rip off a piece anywhere without getting a hard, unbend-able hunk of bread.  I was recommended to try the Kingfisher beer, which apparently is a popular beer consumed in India. It's a light beer, but has a bitter, hoppy kick to it.. Unfortunately, I had to flag down a waiter just to order it.  They sat us down, and just left. My mom wanted to go up and get a plate immediately, but I told her to wait a few minutes because at a buffet, they are supposed to come over and ask what you want to drink. No one ever came. We just sat there staring at each other for five minutes while waiting for someone to stop by the table, to no avail. Kinda odd.  Maybe I will come back for dinner, but I feel like I could find an Indian restaurant just as good (if not better) for less money. For two lunch buffets and a beer, the bill was like $34! Holy S*IT!   One positive: If you go on their website, you can print out a 15% coupon! You will need it with those prices."}
{"text":"Beware!  We have come here a couple of times and found that food was great, but lately management must of change or something... There's several things that were not right.  Behind the seating booths there's dust as if hasn't been clean for months, but the worst part was after finding the second piece of hair in my food, my entire family and I had to leave of how disgusted we were"}
{"text":"This is the best India buffet I've been to. I come every time I hit Vegas. They simply have the best spread with the best flavors and freshest. I highly recommend this place if you love Indian food. Believe me, we are consumers of Indian buffets and this place rocks."}
{"text":"Over priced buffet may be due to location. Went around 11:30am and buffet was missing veg biryani and idli. To me food quality and variety do not justify high buffet cost."}
{"text":"The first Indian restaurant in 1993 and still providing excellent service for tourist and locals."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and very attentive service. Some of the best lassis we've had.  The samosas were delicious.  The dal tarka was also amazing.  If we're in Vegas, we'll definitely make time for a meal here"}
{"text":"Good Indian place in Las Vegas. Convenient location. I like the atmosphere of this place, really big and cool decor. The food is good. The naan was a little dry."}
{"text":"Dinner buffet is delicious and affordable. The food, oh man, it's good. Real good. It's pretty busy as well, which speaks for how good the food is. Nice selection in the buffet."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and what a pleasure to be served by Christal!! Being in good business for over a decade I will highly recommend this place. Owner actually came down to introduce himself and asked if we were doing well. Tells be a lot about a joint when the owner cares. Authentic food!!"}
{"text":"1st time trying India food while on vacation. Food was good but the service was outstanding!  Courteous and attentative!"}
{"text":"I went to Gandhi's  while in Vegas with a friend of mine from high school back in July. If you don't know where this place is, chances are you probably won't find it as it is hidden within a strip mall and you would think it was closed down if you didn't know any better.  We were seated immediately as it appeared that my friend knew everyone in the place. Everyone made sure to come over and say hello and to constantly check on us all evening. I actually felt like a celebrity with all the attention we were getting. Anyway enough about that, onto the food.  We ordered the Paneer Pakora which was homemade deep fried cottage cheese, Gosht Vindaloo, and the Chicken Makhanwala along with tons of Nan. I was in Indian food heaven. The lamb was cooked to perfection and the Chicken had a nice blend of spices and the sauce was divine! I am sitting here licking my lips still remembering just how good it was.   This place is a nice little hidden gem that you should really try if you are ever in Vegas. You do realize that it means you will have to explore outside of the strip so venture if you dare :)"}
{"text":"This was the best meal I have eaten in ages! The ambiance is fantastic and the service was even better! I am a vegetarian, so I have become accustomed to having limited options when I go out to eat. That is not the case here!! There are so many options I can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"I have to say I have been coming here for years. Unfortunately the last few times I have been here, I ended up having serious stomach aches and feeling sick. Now I know and am disgusted as I have been a loyal customer for years. Learning that they have had serious health violations, I will never eat here again. Shame on the restaurant manager and owner. I would give 0 stars but it will not let me. Never eat here. They have no regard for their customers, especially loyal ones."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Im mexican and I rather have chicken tikka masala than burritod"}
{"text":"The service was awesome ! They opened the restaurant earlier just for us, they had a little Chat with us as well ! The food was awesome as well ! Good place ! Felt like India ! Love it"}
{"text":"Food was great. Server had very bad attitude. If you don't like doing customer service. Find another job!"}
{"text":"A few people from my office regularly patronize this location for lunch, so today I came in to give it a shot. I would have NEVER known this place existed if I didn't work near by because it's hidden in a really run down looking plaza just next to Morton's, but inside it has an awesome hip ambiance, low lighting and swanky Indian music!! I left full and happy! I will be back again for the lunch buffet. I can't handle a lot of heat in my food and to me, this was PERFECT, not too spicy and not bland either, lot's of flavor. I LOVED the fresh baked naan bread (I got plain). I have been to another Indian place in the area that gets higher stars on Yelp and I personally like this place way better! During my visit I noticed a lot of Indian patrons eating as well, I take that as a good sign. I totally recommend."}
{"text":"The buffet was amazing and the service was prompt.  Lamb curry was tender and delicious.  The samosa was the best I have ever had and the mango custard was a perfect finish.  I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I had a very nice buffet here this afternoon! The food was very good, especially the tandoori chicken! Most buffet style tandoori is dry, but this was delicious! I enjoyed the butter chicken with rice, not very spicy so perfect for those of who who can't handle the heat. The veggie pakora had maybe been out too long, they were a little mushy, but still had a good flavor."}
{"text":"Second time here. Awesome food. Will continue coming back next time. Very good mango lassi and chicken tikka masala"}
{"text":"Since I am in Vegas, I am enjoying all the buffets. Today I was craving Indian food and decided to visit with my friend. I really enjoyed the lunch buffet. The tandoori chicken was really tender and full of flavor. It was all hot and fresh and really good. A few dishes were a little spicy for me. But the naan was perfect. Customer service wasn't too bad, although they could use a little pep up. Perfect lunch to keep my energy going while we explored the Strip and went to see the fountains. I love Indian food because it sustains my energy for a long time. The place was super nice. I was impressed with how fancy it felt, but the lunch buffet was still an extremely inexpensive amount, especially coming from Hawaii where everything costs an arm and a leg. Thank you for a nice lunch and keep that buffet because I will visit every time I come back!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out from Gandi's because it was the closest to our hotel during our stay, and we ordered from the yelp app as well. First- rice is not included with your order. I didn't realize this when ordering, but it would have been nice to know beforehand! We picked up our order, went back to the hotel, and then had to go all the way back to pick up rice so we could eat. What kind of Indian place doesn't give you rice with your entrees? I have never, ever, been to one. The food was only okay. It was decent, and we ate it, but a disappointment overall. I would not come back."}
{"text":"Christal was good is she served very well  And food malai koftha and navrathan kurma with roti was awesome that's y this credit"}
{"text":"Awesome vegetarian food especially Malai paneer and Dal tadka. Crystal Harris, our waitress was awesome for suggesting the food and drinks!! Will surely visit again!!"}
{"text":"Not worth the hype .. Went there after seeing yelp reviews ... The idly sambar was the worst ! The malai kofta was good .. The rice was not cooked. Not sure if this is the case only today .. Unfortunately it was not a good experience for us"}
{"text":"Okay, here is the story. We went here after we saw this restaurant featured in one of the movie. We went there on Monday night for dinner, wasn't crowded. Food was good, but nothing outstanding. Very dark place. Overall, a nice Indian good after some good tired days of walk and fun in Vegas.."}
{"text":"Food: 3  Service: 3  Had the Gandhi Thali -- a sampler of vegetarian items. The malai kofta was tasty, but the mattar Paneer was blah and had only one small chunk of cheese. The samosa had a tender crust. For dinner, it would be better to go with a group so you can choose the things to share.   Service was OK but unexceptional. I'd like to go back for lunch to try their buffet."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is perfect!   I am all about Indian Buffets. The price here is good too.   Went here for lunch with co-workers and had a great time. Plenty to choose from. The potatoes that have spinach in it is amazing. The naan is nothing to write home about, and some other just okay dishes . For sure try the butter chicken.   Best of all it's not too heavy!"}
{"text":"A nice, calm & relaxed place off the strip. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Vegas. We were staying in Venetian & were bored of eating Italian food. We tried the lunch buffet here & it had lots of option for Vegetarian & non vegetarian. Food was reasonably priced & tasted good. On another day we tried their Ala crate menu as well & it was also good & well priced. Servers here are extremely friendly & help you out to pick right dishes. Big thumbs up."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, once you get inside. Knowledgeable/helpful staff. Lamb was tough, but vegetarian picks were good."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet and it was delicious! Liked the vegetarian, vegan and non-vegetarian options.  The chai tea was amazing too!  Returning soon!"}
{"text":"We walked inside the restaurant very excited to eat at this famous restaurant for dinner and when we entered inside this seemingly authentic Indian restaurant we found it almost empty with none of the hotel staff anywhere in sight and just a couple of diners sitting in one table. we decided to wait for a couple of minutes to see if anyone from the staff would appear. But no one showed up. After waiting for 5 minutes we decided to leave. It was extremely disappointing that a restaurant with such good reputation would give us such a terrible experience!!!"}
{"text":"I go for the buffet. I have no idea what I'm eating but it tastes great.  The service is excellent!"}
{"text":"I ate here a long time ago when it was just a vegetarian place, but now I think they got new management, new interior design, and most importantly NEW CHEFS.  I went for lunch buffet and dinner. The buffet was excellent, well flavored. The only flaw is you have to go up to the buffet to get naan.. so everyone was just waiting until they make some, then everyone rushes to it.  Really good food, reasonably priced. But it's not as good as it gets. =) 4 stars."}
{"text":"Good food. I was surprised to find that they charge $4 for rice though... On the side of curry? Doesn't that usually come with it?   And, the waiter told me that I couldn't order one of the curries because I was not Indian. I think he meant it as a warning about the spice but never-the-less I thought it was funny and worth mentioning.   FYI - the wifi password is \"iloveganhdi\""}
{"text":"Avg and expensive food . We went for dinner.. Aloo tiki was pieces of fried dough , green chutney felt like spolied cilantro smoothie, dal makhani  there was nothing makhani about it just dome boiled lentils , the nan with nuts was so sweet and had only coconut and no nuts  If u tell them what the problem in food they just completely ignore u rather than fix it. So don't go by menu descriptions they just do whatever is convenient to them and use left overs  A big AVOID"}
{"text":"When we arrived, the area looked a bit shady and the restaurant looked small. But let me tell you this is one of the best Indian buffet that I've had in a long time. I stayed at Edison, NJ for more than 3yrs and my expectation of Indian food in tge US is really high. I can tell you that this restaurant was right up there in terms of food quality, taste, cost, etc.   Definitely recommend if you're in the vicinity and looking for some Indian food."}
{"text":"Amazing Indian food! Went today for the first time for a friends baby shower and I was pleased with the service, the variety of food and the taste. It wasn't too spicy or under seasoned. The price was also reasonable. The owner stopped to talk to us, which made it an even more satisfying defining experience."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for Indian food. Their lunch buffet selection is good and all of their food is delicious! Staff is very friendly as well."}
{"text":"The food was superb. The service? Well, it was clear our party was a burden to the server. We weren't told that we'd be charged extra for things like rice and bread, even though the server kept bringing us more. I'm not sure how much each side of rice was, but it was really expensive and they didn't bring us a complimentary portion for our entrees. The portions were tiny. Think Happy Meal tiny. This wouldn't be a problem if the prices weren't so high. All in all, I won't be back, but I'll be looking for another restaurant that has good food, good portions, good prices, and good service. 2 stars just for the food."}
{"text":"Whenever my husband and I come to Vegas, we always eat solely at Las Vegas's best kept secret: Gandhi India's Cuisine.  We've tried other Indian restaurants in Vegas and thought they were just okay.  Gandhi is a cut above.  Everything is so masterfully flavorful, your mouth does a little dance with each bite!  Last time we were there, I discovered the eggplant bhartha which was amazing, also, there's a mushroom dish on the menu that was out of this world--and I'm not even a mushroom lover, I barely even like them!  But the sauce was so yummy and delicious.  The samosas are some of the best we've tasted.  Mango lassi and kulfi are excellent.  Please maintain your reputation by hiring and keeping the best cooks ever.    Also on a side note: please make sure you keep your salt level just right.  I don't eat out much, so sodium can be an issue for me at some Indian restaurants.  The spices, onions, tomatoes, etc., give the perfect taste, not so much salt is needed.  So when in doubt, use a pinch less."}
{"text":"Great great service  Really good food, nice an spicy  Overall great, could not ask for more I will be sure to recommend this place and come back next time I am in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I love Indian food and this is one of the best I have ever had. Incredible setting and food. Yellow Dal is incredible. Feels great after!!"}
{"text":"I was at LV for a convention and ate here. It is without any doubt the best Indian food in this region. The food was authentic. The staff is very accomodating.   They get very busy during dinner. Little early dinner can help beat the crowd."}
{"text":"I've been to Gandhi many time and I've never been disappointed with them either on service or the food.  My favorite is during the lunch buffet, the price is very reasonable and very tasty(even better with 10% off coupon which you can find it on magazine all the time), my Indian neighbor also told me not only they think the food are great, the restaurant never charge their 5 and 4 year old kids, my india friends from CA also loves the food there.  The dinner was a bit more expensive, but well worth it, they have combination dishes that you can get for $16, which include appetizers, 2 course entree, dessert and drinks, I felt just right after I finish it, and the services were good.  Although Origin India has better review, but I've been there just twice and hate their service already(please refer to the one about coupon), trust me, I would rather go to a friendly restaurant where I feel welcome than going to a restaurant with great food but got insulted by the waiters.  here's my review to Origin India, if you want to have great food but in a mood of being insulted, here's the best place to go http://www.yelp.com/biz/origin-india-las-vegas#hrid:lzQO_2nU2Y2CFCXWEZf1rQ"}
{"text":"The food is over-the-top delicious. I really enjoyed the lunch buffet. Ate too much, and had to skip desert."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, super fresh and tasty. great atmosphere and the owners are amazing! Will be coming here again when we are in Vegas again. Thank you for fantastic food!!"}
{"text":"The food was TERRIFIC! Soooooo, good, I could eat their Nan for the rest of my life. I will definitely go back!  The parking however, is sketchy and I  was quite concerned leaving my car outside."}
{"text":"The service was very poor, the atmosphere very average. Food was good, even though we were not ask if we wanted our food mild so our food was hot flavored. Price was ok till u realize that all food is a la carte. I did not realize rice was extra with your curry, so be sure to get your side otherwise you will disappointed. Overall, I will not come here."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Indian food and great service . We were in Vegas for a convention and stopped here for dinner. It's. Must do Indian restaurant ... When in Vegas ."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I went to this restaurant today for lunch. It was 2:30 pm and there were approximately 20 people already in the restaurant eating.  When we were waiting to be seated one of the staff members came to tell us they were closing. It's 2:30 in the afternoon why would they be closing early on a Saturday? Also, their website states they close at 11 pm so that was really weird. I had to look down to see the color of my skin to figure out why they were all of a sudden closing so early. But that's okay, I would much rather give my hard earned money to a company that respect and values their customers regardless of  what race they are. I drove about a mile up the street to another restaurant called India Oven Masala. I had no issues there. Their food was great and their service was awesome as well. So I will definitely recommend going to that restaurant instead."}
{"text":"I've never had such a bad experience with Indian food.  The food was serve on a metal tray like the one in prisons, its terrible and it is rediculousy expensive for the qaulity and portion.  Unbelievable!!!  Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I ate here the other day.. Ilike it. Food was good and so was the service. One of best indian cuisine"}
{"text":"Some of the best chicken and curry I have tasted. The chicken especially, is always tender and the perfect texture and flavor at all times. My go to place for indian cuisine."}
{"text":"The food here is Delicious, I'm usually not the one to write reviews but after ages I had such good kebabs that I am now compelled to write a review. The lentils, lamb was of top notch quality, the chicken was extremely juicy and tender, the atmosphere and the decor was very vibrant. the servers and the quality of food was amazing, the owner even stopped by and checked in on us twice just to make sure everything was of amazing quality, simply amazing guy to talk too, very humble and very attentive to your needs. He offered us a sample of kheer (rice pudding) on the house because he just wanted us to try his favorite desert. Will definitely be bringing my friends here."}
{"text":"I went for dinner and ordered the Tandoori chicken, it was very tender and flavorful. The atmosphere is also great. I am on atkins diet lately and I highly recommend their tandoori chicken (one order is more than enough for even two people)"}
{"text":"There is a lot of Indian Cuisine competition but this place does have great service and great comfort food at a good price. I really enjoy the neighborhood competition, Mint Indian Bistro and Origin of India more though, but there is something about this place that continues to keep itself standing, despite this. I would definitely go here if I had more friends who like Indian food or ate out as much as I used to. This place is a lot older. But I live right up the street from this place and if I got tired of frequenting Mint Indian Bistro on Flamingo, I would go here to get a change of setting. I think it is a little more authentic than the Mint, but I am not a fan of authentic, I like a little bit of flare to my food that is catered to Americans. My friend likes this place more than Mint, so maybe they have some special dishes that stand out for vegetarians...  Again, because it sits in a terrible neighborhood, the fact that it still survived the many years of recession probably says a lot about the authenticity of their dishes. I don't know a lot about their off the buffet menu entrees but I hear they are pretty good.  The decor has antique wood and has a fine dining appeal with the table cloth and nice water glass. But, this seems to be  a common theme for all of the Indian Restaurants, they are very properly set.  The Indian food buffet is a good deal, but if I had patience I would order off the menu because they will cook it to order and the food will taste fresh and more flavorful."}
{"text":"Delicious food! The service was alright, not bad. But the quality of the food was worth a couple mix ups with our orders. Overall, I'd eat here every time I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"I went to this place as I want to support a reopened restaurant.We are vegetarian.  Service & quality have to be improved. New owner's presence is a must otherwise he may have to close it again."}
{"text":"So I gave this place another chance for dinner and lunch. It was pretty good still not a big fan of the obvious downgrade on the silverware department but the food was much better keep it up :)"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible.....blandest tasting Indian food out there and overpriced. Two big thumbs DOWN!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very simple and plain on the outside.  Once you enter, the decor is simple, yet nice.  The atmosphere and music is upbeat.  Service was good and the food here is good, but nothing compared to Baluchi's in New York.  I was there with a group and we ordered mango lassi, a variety of naan, chicken vindaloo, chicken tikka masala, chicken biryani, and more...    The place is worth a try if you are out in Vegas and are willing to explore outside of the strip."}
{"text":"Gandhi is awesome. Please don't take my word for it, go try their fish tikka and fish pakora and I bet you you'll fall in love with it. This comes from a foodie who loves authentic fish!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner.  The food was too oily and spicy, even for someone like me who enjoys the heat.  So spicy, I could barely taste the flavor of the food.  Very expensive, and the portions were so large, I felt like I was wasting food because I couldn't finish it.  Even though the place was almost empty, the service was really slow, and it was hard to find the wait staff to get their attention."}
{"text":"The food was AMAZING. We went to a different Indian restaurant down the street that was not good. We decided to try Ghandi as our cravings weren't satisfied w our last meal and couldn't have been happier. Finally found our go to Indian spot in Vegas!"}
{"text":"What happened here??  When I was here for dinner a little over a year ago, the buffet (the matter paneer in particular) was fan-flippin-tastic.  Service was great, the food was amazing, and I swore an oath to myself that I would somehow come back here.  I was in Vegas with my fianc√© this past weekend and, even though he's not big on Indian food, I talked him into having dinner here because of how good it was.  Womp Womp.  Did they change ownership??  There's no such thing as a dinner buffet anymore.  \"Well, I can't eat embarrassing amounts at the buffet, but at least I can order the matter paneer off the menu,\" I thought.  There was one nice host/busser, one food runner, and one disinterested waiter, which got to be a problem as the dinner crowd picked up.  The naan was sub-par; more burnt air bubbles than anything.  My beloved matter paneer was totally different.  It wasn't bad.  Actually, it was pretty decent, but nowhere near as good as it used to be.  We sat at the table, done eating, plates cleared, for a loooong time before I was able to practically tackle the waiter to get our check.  Had I never been here before, this would have been a 2.5-rounded-up-to-3-stars-to-be-generous experience.  But knowing what was and what could have been, this mostly left me disappointed and apologizing to my fianc√© for misleading him."}
{"text":"After my second visit, I realized this place is not that great. Steer clear of the buffet. Not worth the price for the few dishes offered and very similar selections to make the buffet appear plentiful!  The food does not taste fresh. It seems like it is mainly leftovers that were frozen and then reheated. No thanks...not coming back!!"}
{"text":"Says the deliver on here but they don't when I call the guy was rude and hung up on me so I can't tell you how the food was, I ended up going somewhere else."}
{"text":"We have been coming here almost everyday during our stay at Vegas. Very nice buffet with lot of options for vegetarians"}
{"text":"Having just got off the plane from LA and having not eaten for several hours, I was on the verge of passing out.  (Not really, but I was feeling pretty peckish.)  Jeff and I were driving towards the hotel, when I spotted Gandhi out of the corner of my eye.  Knowing that he likes India, having lived there for over a year, I thought he might like to try.  I am always willing to try a new Indian place.    I got a combination plate that had chicken tikka, some marinated chicken, kafta chopped up and a grilled shrimp.  The plate also came with some lentils, rice, raita, lettuce,paneer in a curry sauce and a curry with shrimp in it.    Jeff got a vegetarian plate that had the same rice, raita and lentils, but he also got a cauliflower dish (I don't remember the name) and some other curried vegetable.  He ate it all, so I know he liked it, but I don't think he loved it.    I loved pretty much everything I got, except the lentils. They needed something.  Salt?  The paneer was delicious.  It reminded me of the fresh cheese my grandmother used to make.  The shrimp curry was delicious, just the right amount of heat to it.  The raita was tasty.  The rice was nothing special.  I liked the naan.  I ate several pieces and I don't normally do that.    Jeff ordered a mango lassi.  He asked that they make it special with no milk, just yogurt.  They did that and he loved it.  He might have ordered another, if he weren't so full.    The service started off really well, but then it went downhill from there.  We got the food and then we never saw the waiters again. They were busy serving others.  So, we waited forever for the bill and a box to take home the leftovers.    The decor was kinda nice, kinda funky, kinda dark and kinda fashionable.  I liked certain parts of the restaurant, like the giant wooden Ganesh near the entrance.  The red on the walls was nice.  The paintings weren't anything special.  They turned up the lights for us, so we could read the menu. There were some special rooms that could be shut off with curtains.  I liked that touch.   I would definitely go back.  I wonder what the buffet would have been like, since we were there for dinner."}
{"text":"Hosted my Daughters BabyShower here and it was a success. Was able to go one day in advance and decorate a good size room and the staff was very helpful. The next day, which was the BabyShower,  we arrived early and again the staff was very helpful and The buffet was amazing.  The Guests keep raving how good the food was.  The manager Crystal was outstanding, took care of us personally and making sure all of our needs were met! Amazing service by her!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent! It was the first time I had Indian Cuisine. I definitely will be come a regular at this restaurant.  Allison"}
{"text":"Guys please AVOID this place at least for Buffet..!!!! I'm not allowed to give No rating else would have done that..  we just came back from Vegas & I couldn't stop myself from writing review for this place. Being an Indian knows how Indian food taste, smell,looks like. Believe me it was nothing like that. The menu was OK nothing fancy for the price you pay. Here is list of items in Vegetarian sect: Yellow daal  Rajma (any damn indian can make that better than what they had) Shahi Panner (tasted just like Heinz ketchup) Aloo Baigan (Big chunk of uncook potatoes) Naan (It took forever to get them, we told them 5 times that there is no naan & how are we supposed to eat all above items) Rice (we didnt cared about that as we left within 10 mins of our so called lunch Bufftet) Onion Pakora (Cold Pakora, have you ever ate one) Idli - (Hard as stone,  they made it 2 days ago to serve it. ) Sambhar (Sambhar was way tooo spicy & trust me when an Indian says too spicy it is...:)  The service is really really really bad. They dont care that you want something or not. They were behaving as if they are doing big favor on us by attending us. ohhh guys cmon .!!! Its one of the Buffet you never want to waste your money. Believe me.!!"}
{"text":"Why was I surprised, after all this place has many two star review. I guess because I've eaten here before and thought the food was pretty good. But there's more to a restaurant than the quality of the food. So briefly here's my prob with this place.   First, they raise their prices when they feel it's appropriate - Christmas week. Yes, the week, not the day. How do you justify with no additional menu items? Next, Naan is part of the buffet and good but dry - most buffets serve fresh naan at the table. There was no patek paneer - I know, amazing huh? Finally, the plastic silverware was just too much. $15 buffet with plastic silverware!"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet was delicious. All the dishes I sampled had great flavor and the spice level was not over the top. Great food, wonderful service ata reasonable price!"}
{"text":"The server had a rude face . And gave bad service . He stand in the corner and uses his phone .   Will not return"}
{"text":"What a hospitality, Awesome Food excellent Price affordable  Staff awesome I highly recommend to everyone to try food at Gandhi Indian Cuisine."}
{"text":"Went for the buffet. The price was$20 per person which was high, and the buffer did not really match up the standards of a $20 buffet!  Food quality was good and staff was fine, but just felt overpriced given what they had on offer"}
{"text":"Alright, this is another place that you have to know how to do right.  I have been here for lunch and dinner, and lunch is totally the way to go.  They have a really tasty Indian buffet with lots of options.  I am not sure which ones are gluten-free, so the next time I go back to Vegas, I'll have more to report.  The service is alright.  I usually go thirsty for water.  Remember, your lassi is not included in the buffet price.  They do have large bus tours of people who come here en masse, so rub your rabbit's foot to make sure you don't show up at the same time.  Dinner is table service, which isn't the most awesome, and provides less value than the buffet.  Great vegetarian selections.  (Again, will update this again with GF facts.)  The best value for Indian food in Vegas."}
{"text":"Worst place to eat for any South Indian. Very expensive buffet($15) for all tasteless food. No salt (or) spices in chicken dishes, but 1&1 only item we liked is chicken tandoori. Don't walk in and expect biriyani r any south indian style food. Bad ambiance and time in filling buffet items. Strongly recommend to stay away from this place if you like to have tasty & and good South Indian buffet."}
{"text":"Love there food but it's been getting bad lately smaller selection and very watery the price is higher then most buffet in town hopefully they can get back on track"}
{"text":"Very helpful! Amazing people... We were late they still let us in gave us what we asked for, and las but not the least called the cab for us which was late and they let us stand inside till the cab arrived. Unbelievably amazing food! The butter chicken is flawless... Perfect for people who like a little spice, but they make it without spice if you want them to. Literally Flawless."}
{"text":"Perfect end to the day! Just what you need after a tiring trip to Grand Canyon.. when burgers/ pizzas just wont cut it anymore.. go for the buffet, you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"Great food, with knowledgeable and fun staff.   I felt very welcome and looked after by Paul, Gerard and Jaz!  I had the Chicken Biriyani, spiced to perfection and the naan bread was SO fresh!  Don't be deterred that is it is buried in a strip mall, it is a 'find'.   I am coming back with a big group of chaps next Jan. for the Consumer Electronics Show.   I don't write many reviews, but this place is special."}
{"text":"Great Food and service, a resident of Las Vegas for 18 years and always extremely satisfied with the food and service. Thank you Gandhi for being  consistently great!!  Anytime friends and family want Indian experience local and out of town I bring them to Gandhi"}
{"text":"The food tasted amazing, and our server was great and efficient! Service was so speedy thanks to Crystal and Sudpal. We come here everytime we come to Vegas, and it gets better every time!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming to this restaraunt since 2009 for one very important reason.. they treat us like family.  We've experienced other Indian venues, but according to my taste buds, nothing compares.  The food is great if you are into strong herbs and spices.  I dont know what is in most dishes, but thats not important if the grub is smack good!  ...I know one of my faves is Chicken Masala. They have a selective buffet from 12pm - 2pm for $11.95 which is a great option for those who want to dib and dab here and there to see if this kind of cuisine is your thing.  The interior is exotic and the music is indian pop which all adds to the dining experience.  When you come in, ask for a server named  Megiddo, i swear he is Ghandi reincarnated!"}
{"text":"Desperate for some Indian food, we were referred to Gandhi's India's Cuisine.  We arrived at 3:30 pm, only to discover they don't open for dinner on a Saturday until 5 pm.  As we debated whether it was worth waiting for, a couple of guys pulled up next to us and RAVED about place...saying \"It's REALLY good...It's HELLA good...\"  So, hearing this, we had to come back at 5 pm and so we did...what a mistake!  As we piled in at 5:30 pm, we looked around at the customers already seated. Lots of Indians were already dining and we took this as a good sign...and then we saw the buffet table set up.  Hmmm...we were hoping for an a la carte menu.  Unfortunately, they only had the buffet option available and so we were stuck with that.    We ordered Mango Lassi to drink and that was a highlight.  Then we all loaded up for the buffet line.  Gandhi's offers a mix of North and South Indian cuisines and I was disappointed with pretty much everything available.  I usually want Indian food when I desire lots of rich spices and tastes going on, and all th dishes simmering away lacked any full or individual flavors.  There was no spice, no heat, nothing that stood out! Blah!    They offered mint-cilantro sauce, but no pappadoms!  Argh.  I love pappadoms and they didn't have any!  I was already disappointed!  I love naan bread in general, but usually try the garlic or onion kinds, or whatever else is offered.  Not at this place, they just had plain naan bread that lacked any real flavor.  Everything had potatoes in it, too much potatoes if any.  One of my dining companions felt that she didn't eat her money's worth and went back for dessert - the mango/condensed milk dessert with fruit cocktail.  We all agreed that was the only thing worth eating there.  How sad is that?!  Sure...I ate...I was hungry.  It wasn't particularly good Indian food.  It was just that...food, and nothing else.  This restaurant was noted as award winning and \"Best Ethnic Restaurant in Las Vegas\" at one point.  I would assume they were a pretty decent Indian restaurant some time ago, but no longer.  I guess it's a sign when an Indian restaurant starts out with an a la carte menu, then ditches it completely to go for the buffet thing, it means hard times.  They are strapped and desperate for business.  Too bad I won't be that desperate enough to come here again unless I'm dragged.  Yeah, for the price of less than $17/pp, you get more bang for your buck this way, but that's not why I came to Gandhi's to eat."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend from Vegas on his reccomendation and at first was a little put off by the outside of the place as it didn't look so nice, but looks can be deceiving! The inside of Ghandi's is very nice, their service was prompt and their food was pretty good. Not the best indian I have ever had but definitely solid food. Next time I'm back in Vegas I would try soemthing different but I would not be afraid to return here."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat. I love there food it is amazing and delicious. For Indian food these is the place to eat. There atmosphere is very nice and clean. There service is friendly and polite. I love there naan bread with Butter/chicken makhanwala, When we go here we always get the same items mixed vegetables, Tomato soup and My husband loves there Tandoori Chicken he says this place is the only place that knows how to make it the right way. We love this place and recommend it to all. One more thing you cant leave without trying there Kheer dessert its aaaamazing!"}
{"text":"I came here for a early lunch. The place is a little dark inside. I had the buffet. The food was good. I would eat there again."}
{"text":"Very very poor service...waited for 30 minutes to be seated and finally got a smelly dirty table with no water no utensils .. Do not suggest this at all..food comes too late..others in d area are far better"}
{"text":"Great food , avg. price. Spicy enough to stimulate your taste buds. Good service. Great  tomato soup , bhindi masala, chana masala , naan, jeera  rice , dal. Great interior. Location and view  from outside dose not reflect that this is located in Las Vegas.  Dull and dark from outside.  Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"Gandhi would have been ashamed of knowing what they have done to their name. Super super rude people. Come on a busy day and they would show you  how they care a fuck about their customers. They promised us a la carte ordering for dinner and a group of around 40 people showed up after us. They quickly changed their attitude and went ahead to actually fight with us. Food looked like it was lying around for more than an hour. And bathrooms super yucky. Thumbs down till they reach rock bottom."}
{"text":"This place is as good as the other Indian restaurants that I've been to in Las Vegas. The food is very good, the portions are still small, but if I go with someone else, I can usually finish their plates as well. One thing that stands out is the decor...It is beautiful. High ceilings, Indian nick-knacks hanging all over the place, linen table cloths, etc. The service is fast, and the prices are in-line with other Indian Restaurants in the area. I will go back if I'm ever on that side of town again."}
{"text":"Awesome food best indian food in Vegas I m coming from last 15 years.. Same taste & good service very friendly. I will recommend Gandhi for indian food..,"}
{"text":"Came here twice in last 4 years. Made good Jain food for my parents and in laws when were in vegas on holiday."}
{"text":"This is a hidden jewel tucked away in a little strip mall about 10 min from the strip.  I was alone and interested in a combination plate.   I found one with an appetizer that looked like a main entree for two!   It was a delicious combination of grilled sausages, shrimp, tandoori chicken...it was fantastic.   The rest of the meal was equally as delicious.  And ended with a frozen mango dessert that was very simple but incredible.     I took half my meal home for tomorrow yet I'm stuffed!  The restaurants Decor is beautiful with many private dining cubbies for larger groups (of 6 plus)  The service was excellent and helpful and clearly commited to giving me a good experience.  I'm glad my yearning for an Indian experience pulled me away from the strip.  I located this place via Yelp and even discovered a small Yelp coupon (never seen one of those before)"}
{"text":"After a long day of walking we decided to get some Indian food but was a huge let down. Located in a cheap strip mall, visit this place if you like to pay top dollars for bad quality food and below par customer service. The cheap plastic forks and spoons and the unfriendly behavior of the owner made our experience worse. This place is definitely not worth it's money."}
{"text":"Ordered malai kofta and Naan..kofta was harder than a rock..very poorly made..the gravy was just filled with turmeric..Naan very very oily and for the cost very very under whelming experience"}
{"text":"This place is great! We come here all the time and the service is always amazing plus, the food is to die for! The chicken tiki masala is what I usually get and it has never disappointed me... Love this place!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great dinner. Food was absolutely delicious. The decor of the restaurant is really cool. It took a little longer than most Indian restaurants to get our food. The people were very nice, but the service was a tiny bit lacking. I will be back."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends mid afternoon, our server was Crystal who suggested some great food and was so helpful! Would love to come back again, great place and great cuisine."}
{"text":"Vegas is the land of the strip mall.  Seriously, outside of downtown, they're everywhere, and wedged in between all the nail salons and paycheck-advance stores, you can find some pretty good restaurants, if you don't mind the less-than-breathtaking surroundings.  Gandhi is a solid, reliable Indian restaurant that we've been going to for years.  The building is mysteriously huge, with super-high ceilings and a dining area that goes on for miles, but it does fill up at peak times on the weekends.  The decor is nothing fancy - bare white walls livened up with some wall hangings or framed pictures - but you're not there for the ambience, you're there for tons of spicy food.  When you sit down, they'll plop some pappadom down in front of you (those crunchy cracker-like flatbreads), plus a mint-cilantro sauce and a sweet-and-sour sauce.  I love this stuff, but be judicious in your use of the spicy sauce, because water service can be a bit slow here.  Everything here is good, especially the garlic naan.  The tandoori chicken is yummy, as is the rogan josh, palak paneer, and tikka masala.  Entrees range from $10--12, although they also have special tasting menus (including salad, rice, and dessert) that range from $15--22.  They have a lunch buffet on weekdays that's also an excellent value.  And there's a pretty good selection of beer and wine, including a few Indian beers, to go with your meal.  Nothing fancy decor- or ambience-wise, Gandhi nevertheless delivers good and reasonably priced Indian food in a quiet and pleasant setting.  If Vegas isn't already hot enough for you, spice it up with a trip to Gandhi.  And get the garlic naan!"}
{"text":"What I remember most about Gandhi: the surprising interior and the tad expensive price tag on the lunch buffet (and my charming lunch companion). The buffet was large with plenty of vegetarian selections, and the food was good. I thought the flavors were tempting; they led me back for a second plate, but the vegetables were a tad overcooked, and hence, some things did not appear to be the freshest. Overall, I enjoyed my lunch, but when I find myself thinking about the interior and cost, I know that the food was not mind-blowingly delicious. At $12 the price is not the best value for Indian buffet, which is always a consideration for me. (The star rating is largely a reflection of the price.) Plus, since visiting Gandhi, I have revisited my go-to Indian buffet to confirm my taste buds preference.  The interior is quite impressive, a remodel since the days of the overhead carpet, and a stark contrast to the exterior surroundings. There are private rooms in the back, and I could see hosting a small private dinner here, as the restaurant feels spacious and nice.   However, this may be the last time I stray from my tried and true all time fave Indian buffet in Vegas, as I think my taste buds might run away if I try to take them anywhere else!"}
{"text":"First impression, something smelled amazing and the place is absolutely cool. Makes you feel like you're inside an old Indian temple.. Very greatly decorated. We had an absolutely wonderful person serving us, Crystal. It was my first time eating Indian food and she was extremely patient and had excellent recommendations. Food was delicious. I went into this expecting not to like it and was so pleasantly surprised to find out, I actually quite liked it! Would recommend this place to anyone. P.S. The buttered chicken curry is literally heaven in your mouth. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came for the lunch buffet and was not disappointed! Very good food at a great price and the staff was very friendly. The owner came and talked to us and asked how we liked everything. They're the first Indian restaurant in Las Vegas and they get people from all over the world that come based on word of mouth. Would highly recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"12 of us of went here for dinner & Crystal served us by herself for the most part. We have several in our group who had never had Indian food. Crystal's patience in explaining dishes & making recommendations to those people was wonderful. She handled our large party with skill & efficiency. The food was outstanding. I plan to go back when I am in Las Vegas again! Between the excellent service & food it was an outstanding meal!"}
{"text":"Bacchanal buffet my ass! Gandhi buffet it is!   The food tastes fresh, there is variety and its delicious!! What's not to like for a hungover group of 10 guys! I had a sampling of everything but stuck to my dal chaawal staple which was perfect for me. They have idli, sambhar and upma too for the average south Indian!   When a buffet costs $14-15, you would think they would invest in cutlery. Nope. although the plates are ceramic(very light), the cups are 'take-out' material cups and the spoons look metallic but they are 'faux' metal spoons. The fork bent while cutting into my idli, haha. Come on guys, invest a bit more.   Will be back."}
{"text":"Average food. Good, traditional and ethnic atmosphere. Buffet items are often cold and limited. Service is rude, unless you are an ethnic Indian. They often take your food away while you are still eating and do not like to answer questions. I prefer Tamba restaurant myself, which I hear is managed by same individuals. However, they just started managing this place, so maybe there are good things to come...we shall see."}
{"text":"Wow!  Just loved everything about this experience.  The food was very delicious, the waiters were constantly making sure we had enough water, were satisfied with our food, and were otherwise taken care of.  The decoration of the place is cool, too - definitely not what you'd expect looking at it from the outside.  And, for all you vegetarians/vegans, there's plenty to eat here - and though I can't remember what dish I had (the waiter picked it out for me), it was SO good!  Definitely a spot I'll come back to."}
{"text":"I was visiting from California and was looking for some good Indian food. There were several in the area but we choose Ghandi's. I had the goat curry with rice and naan. Overall it was good. Not the best and definitely not the worst. The staff was friendly enough and I liked the restaurant and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was my first Indian restaurant, honestly I'm not a big fan of spicy food. This is the reason I'm giving it 4 stars. Decoration was beautiful, and our waiter was very hospitable. He assisted my friends and I to understand the menu and select our dishes. Unfortunately, spicy food isn't my thing but my friends sure did enjoy their food. If you love spicy, this is definitely the place for you."}
{"text":"This was the best indian restaurant my parents liked. They r vegeterrian and were happy to see lot of veggi options ... Their food is like home and desserts (sevayian kheer) was awesome. I absolutely recommend brunch buffet. Good north-indian lunch and south indian breakfast. Overall a good place to have a brunch. +1 for Gandhi"}
{"text":"5 star for Crystal. Very good service and really kind. We enjoyed the food and service. We'll comeback for sure."}
{"text":"Typing while I am eating here. My service has been very good. Attentive , friendly, and polite staff is very welcoming upon arrival. The mint chutney is very good and a little spicy but I love hot food. My naan is over cooked and a little dry. The chicken vindaloo is exquisite . One of the better versions I have had. If you ask for hot, it is HOT. Be careful what level of spice you ask for. It is a really great place to eat. I give it 3.5 stars because of the naan."}
{"text":"I try to find an Indian restaurant in almost every city I visit because I love it so.  I've made three visits to Gandhi's while in Vegas and every time have had an excellent meal with great service.     I've even visited the lunch buffet.  Lunch buffets can be mediocre and are often bland, but not at Gandhi's.  good stuff."}
{"text":"The buffet is ok here.  I actually enjoyed dinner much more.  I got one of the tandoori sets which was pretty good.  I'd rather go to other places for an Indian lunch buffet.  But the atmosphere is kinda \"eh\" here compared to some of the other places around which is why this wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Regulation Indian restaurant in the USA. Watered down food for the most part. But not bad."}
{"text":"I ate here recently & I must say I almost shed a tear. My taste buds had never taste something so delicious lol ok, maybe I'm over doing it a little, but seriously it was my first time having Indian food and I must say it was amazing. Although the selection wasnt very much, what they offered was so good it didn't even matter. My favorite was the grilled chicken. Not only is the food tasty, but the environment is so relaxing and the workers are very polite. I definitely recommend this place. Yu won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Las Vegas (with all due respect to the many excellent places that I haven't eaten). The Bombay thali was superior (I should have ordered two!) Wonderful ambiance, attentive servers, and a lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Indian restaurant! Good food, caring service, they once fed us after they were closed, we knocked on door, and we explained that we were tired and hungry and had driven 6 hrs to get to Gandhi, they fed us a great dinner! We are big fans! And always eat one meal here , when we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"This restaurant felt like home. I loved the seasoning and the flavors! The staff was so nice and kind and really took care of us. I will go back!"}
{"text":"Crystal is awesome we ordered Gandhi thali is was the best she was very attentive and i will be be back definitely!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great & friendly service but wow, the food was spectacular. The restaurant is also beautifully & authentically decorated on the inside. Apparently this is the very first Indian restaurant opened in LV!... definitely lives up to that."}
{"text":"Really good lunch buffet!   (ends at 1pm, so go before!) Slightly different choices depending upon the day... Definitely one of the best Indian food spots in town."}
{"text":"Best Indian buffet in Las Vegas  I am pure non vegetarian & my wife is vegetarian. And we visit Vegas several times every year since last 17 years. I have dined at many desi restaurants here. This is my second review of Gandhi. Last time I gave a 3 star not because their food was not good but because of other reasons. but now they deserve better rating. The lamb curry is fantastic (my all time favorite) & so was the chicken tikka masala.  My wife loves the malai kofta & so did I. We love their rice & dal fry too. And no, they don't use plastic ware or paper cups for buffet anymore. I have dined in many Indian restaurants all throughout the US & I think Gandhi is one of my favorite North Indian restaurant. Their Indian buffet definitely ranks in top 3 in the US. Good job team!!"}
{"text":"Truly disappointing lunch buffet. I've been to Gandhi a few times and its been pretty good. This is the first time I tried the lunch buffet and, the fact that I felt compelled to leave a review, should be an indicator of how I felt my meal went. First of all, no one at the front when I came in, i came in and looked at the buffet line and then waited for roughly 2-3 minutes to even see an employee, they finally sat me and I got my first round of food. The tandoori chicken was nearly cold and hard as a rock, the side that was on the chafing dish was charred to a crisp (not always a bad thing). I informed the young waiter that the tandoori chicken was cold, he went and took the temperature of the chicken, said something to his, what looked to be his boss, then closed the lid. Clearly it was under temperature and he tried to reheat it in this way... huge health hazard that could get them closed in of itself. No biryani, only 3 meat dishes and all were chicken, no naan or rice on the buffet line so it had to be brought out which seemed to be difficult to even find someone to help. My drink remained empty for the majority of my meal even though a waiter kept walking by. I finally asked for a refill and it took him about 8 minutes to bring me my refill. Sweet rice for dessert? what the hell is that? Literally their basmati rice that they serve to everyone, mixed with milk and sugar. It was disgusting and the rice was under cooked. I'm Indian... I have never heard of this recipe before.... for 11.95... its a rip off. Enjoy GOOD indian food and drive a block up to Delhi Indian Cuisine."}
{"text":"Pathetic service , rude behavior , asking kid not to make a mess . I suggest everyone just ignore this and try a another one."}
{"text":"Awesome Indian food! Tried everything in Vegas but no match..... Must try.... Make sure you try mango kulfi"}
{"text":"Please AVOID this place !! If given an option I will give 0 stars  When we walked in, we were told they dont serve ala carte items and only buffet option. But what they didnt tell us was, they wont refill the buffet items. Whatever items we asked, they said its over and not be refilled. The tandoori chicken was too unflavourful and tasted. None of the Paneer dishes had paneer. Idli was too hard and made days ago. They just heated the frozen idlis and served them. The only thing they refilled was plain rice and Naan. Desserts were also bad.  The service is ok but not great. But definitely not worth the price you pay for the buffet."}
{"text":"Solid value in the all you can eat lunch buffet. Carb overload usually sets in 30 minutes later but worth it. The service is okay the decor works. They could turn down the music a little. It felt a little cluby during the day. They have a chutney with olives that I put on most everything. It's spicy and bitter at the same time but I like it. All of the dishes are prepared with quality in mind. This Yelper likes the $11 lunch!!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious. However, entr√©e is $15 and you have to pay extra for sides ( rice). I guess that's fine but you have to warn people of that in the menu. Driver did not speak English."}
{"text":"The food is great, the dal makani is awesome.  I was there for thanksgiving dinner and they ran the buffet all day long and into dinner which was cool, but thw service is atrocious.  I was never even offered anything other than water while I watched other tables being attended to well.  Maybe a single ABCD isn't a valued guest."}
{"text":"Okay, so I'll be honest, I have not eaten at a whole bunch of other Indian restaurants.  That being said, the lunch buffet is absolutely delicious.  I am relatively new to Indian food, and my friend told me I had to try this hidden gem.    The restaurant itself is squeezed behind an Albertsons (next to a wig shop) but don't let that deter you!  Inside is very nice, and open.  Everything I had on the buffet was delicious (and I tried a little bit of almost everything!) and the servers kept our water glasses full and our table clear of abandoned plates.  I would definitely recommend this to others, and I will return (if only for the tikka masala...omg so delicious).  My friend told me that regionally, this restaurant favored the northern styles of cooking and most of the others nearby are more southern in orientation.  So keep that in mind if this is not entirely what you expected.  I found everything to be delicious.  I've been stuffed for hours. Give it a shot.  :)"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for more than 7 years, and no other restaurant compares to it. The customer service is excellent and they go above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience.  Food is fresh with real authentic Indian flavors. The buffet offers great variety at a great price. I take family and coworkers here whenever possible. Great ambience, food, and customer service all at a great price.Try Gandhi you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place I have been dining here for years the food is awesome the service is excellent the atmosphere pleasing I highly recommend the Gandhi thali sampler platter and lunch buffet"}
{"text":"I ate at ghandi on paradise for the lunch buffet recently, the food was decent, cost was 10$ nothing amazing."}
{"text":"Awesome.  Great food & service. We'll be back very soon.  Tikka Masala is one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Run down restaurant with okay food but exceptionally ride management and staff, won't be returning here and can't recommend this place to anyone anymore."}
{"text":"Ridiculous. Utterly ridiculous. I just called and attempted to place an order by telephone. I was promptly asked to call back in 45 minutes! What kind of business asks a potential customer to call back??! I apologized for bothering them and informed them that I wouldn't be giving them my business. Sorry about it."}
{"text":"The place is loc in the middle of a shady strip mall.  We got there and it LOOKS elegant from the inside, but dont be fooled.  The waiter took forever to take our order and took forever to bring us our food, - so Poor service.  The food was so bland and non tasty.  I ordered the meat Thali and it wasnt good at all.  Might as well have starved.  and on top of that it was crazy expensive.  like 15-18 dollar per plate.  I dont wanna pay that much and get nothing back in return.  Im Indian - take it from me - this place SUCKS."}
{"text":"Although the outside is not spectacular, I was impressed with their set up and buffet service. I was feeling the mood, the music, the food aroma, the curtains, etc. It was a nice place and our waiter was very attentive and funny. The food was delicious and I thoroughly enjoyed every dish. Mango Lassi was to die for. Overall, lunch buffet price is within inexpensive-affordable. I will be sure to make a trip here whenever I go to Vegas!!"}
