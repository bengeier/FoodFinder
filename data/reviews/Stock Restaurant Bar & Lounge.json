{"text":"Went there for Summerlicious for this first time this year. For the high end dinner option $45 the portions were quite inconsistent. Most appetizers were small with the exception of the spinach salad. I ordered the bay scallop and salmon ceviche and found it unusual to include popcorn. The crunchy popcorn texture became lost and chewy quickly from the moisture in the sauce and seafood. I understand what they wanted to go for... However the execution failed. 

Alternatively the sea bream (fish main) was cooked and portioned well.

For dessert,  the sweet and savory cheese plate was also depressing. It came with one singular peach macaroon which was smaller than an Oreo, a single chocolate truffle the size of a glass marble, and two clumps of cheddar cheese and two pieces of croustini. Super small. Would have been nice to perhaps plated it on a smaller plate.

Cocktails featured were great. Their standard drink menu was obnoxiously over priced. 10 dollars for a Bottle of mill street organic. Really? 

Overall mediocre service and over priced food. I can easily go anywhere on the city to get exceptional food for the eye gouging prices you'd see at Stock. 

Would never have gone there had it not been for Summerlicious. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch

Is this your scene? 35th floor, DJ playing music, over-priced food and drinks ... somewhat pretentious but a place to be seen?

We were pleasantly surprised with the quality of food laid out for brunch
- seafood: steamed mussels, chilled shrimp, smoked salmon and freshly shucked oysters
- freshly made omelettes
- roast beef (tender but not a heap of flavour)
- decent selection of chocolates

The bill was $150 for 2 people, food + caesar + juice (including tax and tip). We came expecting something like this so were not surprised.

Will not be everyone's cup of tea - but unlike other brunch places in Toronto, you won't have to line up for an hour as they take reservations!"}
{"text":"Came for winterlicioua lunch. The restaurant looked a bit crowded, but service was very good. I tried the salmon, and loved it! (Even more than the winterlicious lunch entrée from Canoe) Appetizer beef tartar was beautiful. Definitely recommend for winterlicious!"}
{"text":"Four of us went for dessert on last Thursday night. As a restaurant in a 5 stars hotel and charge the 5 stars price on dessert, we expected some thing, however Service are terrible and unprofessional. First no one come to greeting us for 10 minutes. Secondary  the waiter serve the wrong drink to the wrong person with cross table to hand over our drink and dessert ,is this call 5 stars service?"}
{"text":"I had the chance to try out the new trump tower restaurant the other day and as far as food goes I was blown away. There was a special even going on that took up the entire bottom floor of the restaurant but we were seated on the second floor overlooking the lower area and it did help in lowering the volume a bit.

Food:

The food quality, I had the 12 ounce Filet Mignon and it is probably in the top 5 steaks I have ever had in my life. I ordered it medium-rare and it was lightly charred on the outside and hot pink from the centre to the edge. Exactly how a steak should be done. As far as quality steaks in Toronto go, this beat out the filet I had at both barbarian and harbour 60.

My buddy ordered the beef short ribs. They were fall off the bone tender in an amazing sauce.

We started with the charcuterie board. Nothing too new that you can't find at the hoof, and a tad pricey for the size but very good nonetheless.

As sides we got the frites and asparagus. the asparagus was fairly standard but the frites were excellent, a bit salty, but that's how I prefer them anyways.

For dessert we had the chocolate cart. Due to the event we did not get to choose of the cart instead our server brought us a broad selection of different things on a board. Nothing was disappointing but the peanut butter truffle, the dark chocolate caramel truffle, the milk chocolate bark with peanuts and caramel, and the honey and caramel covered almonds definitely stood out as excellent.

Service:

From what I have heard from others the service can be hit or miss here. However for us it was pretty good, but I'm pretty sure this had to do with the event downstairs, since they had 6 different people covering the 10 tables upstairs. We were served fairly quickly and finished our 3 course meal in just under 2 hours, pretty standard pace, not too slow and didn't feel rushed.

Ambiance:

The view was excellent from that second floor balcony overlooking the rest of the restaurant. behind us was a nice view down bay street to the water and to our other side was a nice view of the other Toronto skyscrapers. The lighting is generally dim and for dessert we started using our phones to light the menu, but after the waiter noticed this the lights were turned up. It was fairly noisy but then again there was a pretty big event on the main floor of the restaurant.

Summary:

I really enjoyed it. The quality of food more than made up for any little flaw that I noticed. The steak and dessert are what earned the 5-star review. I definitely want to go back to try the other items and definitely have more of the fantastic dessert."}
{"text":"Amazing!   The minute I walked in I loved the decor, stylish and sleek. The high ceilings are unheard of and there's no focus on outside view which was fine with me by the decor , the people watching, the food passing was enough to keep my eyes happy.  Best foie GRAS I've ever had, and the stack was cooked to perfection. Every bite just melted in my mouth,  fav part was the chocolate cart that they bring by where u pick your chocolate and they weigh it for you.  Finished off with fried donuts that were out of this world.  And the staff was very attenuation but most importantly friendly and approachable.  This resto was definelty an experience that blew me away :-)."}
{"text":"Great Experience, I stayed at the Trump during my visit to Toronto and must've eaten here at least 5 times between breakfast, lunch, dinner and room service. Every time we had new items off the menu and every time we were blown away. Save room for dessert it is definitely worth it. The service was very professional and accommodating not to mention the view was breath-taking. Would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting or living in Toronto."}
{"text":"We went for their Sunday brunch yesterday and liked it. The whole Trump experience starts the moment you step into the hotel, where you are greeted by their courteous lobby staff. The same service extends to the restaurant, which is on the 31st floor (same floor as Quartz spa). The restaurant is smaller than I imagined, but had soaring high ceilings and chic and classy decor. There is also an upper level and patio for seating. However I was surprised at the proximity of the tables to each other; it was not too crowded today, but I can imagine that dinners can be a little toooo cozy when the restaurant is at full capacity. We could clearly hear conversations at the tables next to us. The weather was gorgeous today, so they left the door to the patio opened to let the sunshine and breeze in....loved it. The patio itself is not very big, just a narrow row of tables, but that's ok. 

On to the food itself. The Sunday brunch buffet is $49 per person. Usual appetizers with salads, cheese, parma ham, which were all pretty good. There isn't a huge variety but the quality was good and food was fresh. Seafood includes freshly shucked oysters, clams, gigantic shrimp (my favourite, these are like the ones you see at McEwan's) and smoked salmon. There is a made to order pasta station. The tomato sauce is very fresh and flavourful- even though I am not a big fan of pasta, I would highly recommend it! The hot table had soup (didn't try, so I'm not sure what kind of soup this was), bacon (so-so), breakfast sausage (good), roasted vegetables, roasted Kuffler potatoes (very good), and roasted prime rib (good). Again, not huge in terms of variety, but very high in quality, which I value more.

Dessert included waffles (add your own toppings), and a variety of small bite size brownies/pastries/cookies/tartlettes. So delicious! I was really looking forward to trying their chocolates made in their Chocolate Lab. They did not disappoint. Really good chocolates (better than the ones you get at certain gourmet chocolate shops). However, they only had three varieties, I would have liked to see more. There is also granola and yogurt with pick-your-own toppings including fresh berries.

All in all I liked the brunch experience. There was also a DJ playing light music. Would come back again for a relaxing weekend lunch/brunch. Valet parking for $10."}
{"text":"I booked a table for lunch through Open Table and arrived on time.  There was no one at the desk but someone finally came to greet me after about 3 to 4 minutes.  The restaurant had perhaps 5 or 6 tables filled, yet I was seated next to a loud and boisterous table of diners.  I asked for an unsweetened ice tea and was given a glass of ice water (and then terribly overcharged) that perhaps a tea bag had been dipped into once.

My waiter proceeded to ignore me (as a solo diner, this happens far too often) but finally took my order.  The Lobster Salad was mediocre at best, with chewy lobster that tasted rather bland, and very few greens, a few cherry tomatoes and not much else.  I had to flag down the waiter to request the bill as he had not checked in with me to see how I liked my meal, or if I wanted coffee or dessert.

To cap it off, the restaurant notified Open Table that I was a no-show!

I will never return, that's for sure."}
{"text":"The view from terrace was nice, and it was a nice restaurant overall. However, the food is just okay...yet you are paying a lot for what you get. 

I will return to try the sunday brunch."}
{"text":"3/5. Recommend the filet mignon and a cheese platter for dessert. I do not recommend the lobster salad (overpriced and not filling). Overall, the ambiance and service was great but extremely pricey. Great for corporate events."}
{"text":"We had brunch here on Sunday and from the moment we walked in here, we were treated with white gloves. The food was very nice.  The variety was great.  The sweets were lovely. The service wAs perfect. It is definitely a place to take someone to make a good impression. Our patty loved it and we left there having a great time. Great experience.  Exactly was I expected from trump towers."}
{"text":"I proposed to my wife at this restaurant. The food and atmosphere are stunning amazing. It's definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I had to try this STOCK restaurant that all my colleagues on Bay have been ranting and raving about. It was OK not great or WOW. It is definetly toooo loud. I was with a group of 5 people and we could hardly get a word into eachother without yelling as their were louder voices around us.

The food was great not WOW. The menu lacked  a full range of choices and was minimal. I had the Burrata and the New York Strip. I have had better steaks at local steak houses. 

I think I was more disappointed as I thought we would be sitting at the top of the tower with a view overlooking Toronto. The website portrays this image. The windows are all covered with drapes no view of Toronto.. BORING!

Decor is great!

Customer Service great!

Dessert: Gave me the wow factor... We had the Beignets. They were delish!!

I guess  I went in with high expectations and they weren't met. At least I can say I did  I tried it..

Oh and NO Donald Trump! LOL!"}
{"text":"We visited STOCK Restaurant yesterday for dinner during Winterlicious. After reading that STOCK is in the top ten most expensive restaurants in Toronto, I thought trying it out with a relatively inexpensive a prix fixe menu would be the best way to test the (iced, sparkling, or flat?) waters. Through my experience I've learned some valuable lessons about dining at STOCK. 


Lesson #1: Don't wear jeans. You WILL stand out and feel fairly awkward.

Since I've been sick all week, I didn't even consider dressing up to leave the apartment. Don't make my mistake! My inner old lady reminds me that is it better to be overdressed than underdressed. In this instance, I have to agree with the old biddy.


Lesson #2: You are above intimidation.

This restaurant is upscale, but the people that work front of house are employed in the service industry. Expect only the best service, regardless if you're making six figures or not. Each staff member was polite and extremely attentive, though the wait staff were particularly lacking a warmth and care for my individual concerns.


Lesson #3: Expensive =/= Good.

Okay, that was a bit of a lie. The food was good, but it wasn't mind-blowing. We both started with the Lentilles du Puy Soup (w/ smoked ham hock torchon, brussel sprouts, garlic chips). Haaa-maze-zing. Can we start jarring this stuff and selling it in grocery stores?

My guy had the Rump & Shoulder of Lamb (w/ gnocchi, rutabaga, turnips, heirloom carrots). I never gravitate towards lamb on a menu but I really wish I had. It was tender and juicy and spiced to perfection. I had the Provencal Vegetable Mosaic (w/ basil, local wild forest mushrooms, olive clumps). It was alright, but I wouldn't choose it again. Maybe it was my cold, but the flavours just weren't working for me.

The desserts looked appetizing. My guy had the Caramalized Quince Tart (w/ brown butter pineapple, candied ginger, spiced cake) and I had the Winter Confections (w/ persimmon macaron, cranberry marshallow, butternut squash truffle, bosc pear bonbon). Again, I believe my cold prevented me from fully enjoying the taste of the confections but I was able to savour the rich texture and extra light, crisp crust of the persimmon macaron. The rest of the goodies I could take or leave, including the spiced cake.


Lesson #4: 31st floor doesn't guarantee a good view.

When I found out STOCK was located on the 31st floor of the Trump International Tower & Hotel, I got excited to eat a meal with a fantastic view. Unfortunately the view is wasted to most customers. I'm not sure how many diners can actually see out of the windows, but it seemed that even those people seated near the windows could not see out of them.


Needless to say I won't be dining here regularly. The atmosphere is a stiff for me and the prices are beyond what I can justify paying for one meal. If I do make my way back, I'd like to explore the drinks menu."}
{"text":"Blah....

I went for brunch at the trump, The price is high and I figured the quality would be too.

Unfortunately it was just OK. The most impressive thing for me would be the oysters for brunch.

Out of 5
Service: 4
Food: 3
Ambiance: 4"}
{"text":"A group o friends and I went to Stock to celebrate a friends birthday.  We made reservations for 9 as the restaurant was very busy due to summerlicious.  Our table was not ready, so we waited outside on the patio until our table was ready.  30 minutes and our table was not ready.  The restaurant manager on duty that night was amazing.  He brought us a complementary bottle of champagne because of our wait.  A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  I ordered the pea soup, the roasted chicken and the flourless chocolate cake.  O&B never fails to amaze with their innovated menu and food.  
One thing about trump is the service.  From beginning to end the service was impeccable.  Maybe its because of the trump name and the New York standard of service, but alot of restaurants could take a hint on the quality of service and experience they provide.  
Everything was just perfect!  I cannot wait to go back...especially for their steaks!"}
{"text":"We went there for winterlicious dinner.
The service was perfect, i have no complain about that, but the food, i can say it was one of the worst foods i have ever had. Actually it was nothing special for the money you pay, never go there again."}
{"text":"The ambience, the atmosphere, and the view are just worth being here itself. The food was good, dessert was better, and the drinks were the best. I would definitely come back again because the service made a huge difference, quick, kind and professional. But I went here during lunch."}
{"text":"First of all, we eat with our eyes. If we can barely see our food, already part of the excitement with coming to such a beautiful restaurant is lost.

Food: I came here with 4 friends for Summerlicious ordering the gazpacho, ribs and fondant. Loved each one: the gazpacho had blue crab (I LOVE seafood) and it had a good amount of heat. I used some of the bread for dipping and it was delicious! The short rib was very tender and fell right off the bone. The chocolate fondant was rich, and it was just right! 

Environment: My big minus is simply the lighting. Maybe if we were seated at the bottom level it would've been better but upstairs, it was like we were eating during a power outage. I get it. The dim lighting sets the mood.

Other: When asked about the water, we opted for tap water. Little did we know, we were charged $12 because of their 'in-house filtration system.'

I wish I could've seen the details of each dish more!"}
{"text":"Cool venue + loud ambiance + descent food + great wine list + average service = 3. 
The balcony on the 31 st floor = 5
The DJ on his Mac playing music a bit too loud = -1
The tuna tartare 1, the foisgras -1, the octopus 1, the braised beef ribs with amazing polenta cubes infused with truffle 2, the gnocchi with rabbit -2, the long wait to take out order -1, pouring still water into my sparkling water -1, bringing the bill before I finished ordering -1. 
Overall I have to say that at a 5 star Hotel, I expected things to be a lot more refined but still cool. If you are looking to spend $400+ at dinner for two, check out Jacobs or Rosewater for better services and ambiance."}
{"text":"This review applies to the bar section of this restaurant. 
We wanted to try the bar at ground level but it didn't have tables left as they were somehow all \"reserved\" sans the patrons. We waited a bit then decided to try this place instead. 
Located at the 31st floor of the hotel/condoplex this place is split into two parts the larger area being the restaurant and the smaller area being the bar.  The decor immediately strikes you as NYC 80's from what I have seen in the movies. I almost wanted to blurt out greed is good :)  as that's the kind of place they would hangout in wall street or american psycho (gulp!) movie. Our coats were checked in by the hostess. 
There was a DJ spinning music on the weekend but I am not sure its a daily thing. It was quite loud here and I would not like to dine here if I want a piece of quiet.
The bar area was packed as well and is quite small actually. I think they cap out at 30-40 people max for the bar. The bar area was packed to the hilt and we had to wait a bit to find a seating. 
The drinks menu is extensive with lots of liqour, Liquer and wine options though the cocktails list is limited. The prices are in $$  range for normal drinks, expected I guess for a place like this. I also checked out the prices for the bottle service and I thought they covered a wide range (I don't have reference point for bottle service but they ranged from 1$$ to a whopping 9K) They  were also pushing the tasting for King Louis the XIII so if you wanna try it this is a good place to get a taste.
My friend and I went for single malt and bourbon while his GF ordered a cherry blossom spritz. Our drinks were served promptly and the cocktail was good according to our friend. Again we were lucky enough to grab a sofa and sat altogether otherwise it will be hard to talk to each other. One can order food in the bar area too as I saw some people having fries and Charcuterie.
Now for the crowd in the bar area it was an interesting mix with some hotel guests and youngish though well heeled crowd. 
The dinning area was another story much older crowd IMO I even saw the local wanna be Trump Realtor there as he walked by several times so I can imagine this place being a see and be seen kind of joint while its new.
Personally I enjoyed myself at the bar and wouldn't mind coming back here. 
3.5 Stars.
P.S. they have an open area outside which doesn't offer much in terms of a view but is a nice place to be if you want to get away from the mayhem indoors."}
{"text":"Did Sunday Brunch here for my birthday - we were a large group so we got the loft space.  

The whole event was impeccably run by the staff and while the buffet area looks small (when compared to Vegas) there is a LOT of food.  

Staff was on point and catered to all of our needs (made me a ginger punch because I was hungover and got a friend a fur blanket because she was cold! ) 

Guests from my birthday have subsequently planned their own events in the loft space."}
{"text":"let's get this straight..nothing about this is my scene.  If I had to describe my scene the top three things on the list would include, \"NOT the bar in the Trump hotel\".
But on a night with a whiney man-baby that wanted to go to a pricey exclusive type lounge and refused all offers of mine to go to some sweet ass dive bars and drop him off at the local  strip bar, I was tricked into going to Stock.

Once here the mood was cool, the room dark and crowded and the women.  my...the women...few and far between and the ones that were there were dressed unlike anything else.  Now I've been to some nice places in Toronto..the kind of nice places where the pricetag on drinks will have you eat cereal for the rest of the week.  But I have never seen so FEW women ALL dress so ridiculously in my life.  Think FUR and SEQUINS ONNNNN the SAME coat.  yeah... 
that happened.

Now the men.  some just dudes after work.  Some you can tell are pretentious arses waiting to get the sequin-fur into bed.  

But a night of drinking?  A possible absurd bill broke even..  My buddy got my first drink which he promised me would be laced with everything fun and fantastical for providing reluctant company to his absurd whims.  And the bottle of red was taken care of some hot shot wearing purple socks.   thank you, Purple Socks- your conversation was entertaining and your socks magical.

So why the three stars on a place I hated the thought of going to?
Well, I actually had fun.  Yes, given any amount of alcohol I understand the chances of having fun are high.  But I had fun and the environment didn't PREVENT me from having fun (the music wasn't TOO loud, the service wasn't TOO pretentious or bad, the people weren't TOO unbearable).  Mix that in with some generous patrons wearing things you can make fun of in a yelp review?  Well that deserves a star or two in itself, non?"}
{"text":"4.4/5 - Really enjoyed our Summerlicious meal here yesterday! I enjoyed my time here from the first step I took into the hotel until I left. Most of the staff were very attentive and warm - as we were leaving and there was group of people taking pictures (and in the way of us leaving), and I believe it was the maitre d' who made room for us to walk by. Water was refilled promptly, all but once, and although our servers didn't really smile, they were very professional and well-mannered.

I am happy with everything I ordered and they were kind to accommodate my last minute request to change my dessert choice - am I ever glad that I did!

Course 1: Citrus-Cured Atlantic Salmon (generous portions, fresh and tasty)

Course 2: Grilled Angus Flat Iron Steak & Summer Ratatouille (came medium-rare. looked a bit bloody but taste more medium-well to me. the artistic presentation of the food was very nice but I couldn't get over the bloody!)

Course 3: Sweet & Savoury (peach macaron, blackcurrant truffle, 10-year-old cheddar) - you must order this dessert because out of the 3, this one takes the cake in variety, originality and taste!

Decor was very simple in the dining room, but I loved the high ceilings and could picture enjoying afternoon tea there. This is a must go establishment! I would say it's even better than Canoe - service wise, it's definitely one-up."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, great service, missing a great view.

31st floor and most of the windows are blocked, my guess is if they were open they'd have a bad view of another boring building in Toronto's Financial District.

Now here's a restaurant that lives up to it's reputation.  Chef Todd Clarmo does a wonderful job, and would make Mr. Trump proud to have a restaurant like this in his hotel.

I started with the Hamachi Crudo.  It was a huge disappointment, killed in flavor and the fish just didn't appear up to par.

Redemption was made with a penne pasta dish that savored flavor, and the wine pairing suggested by the waiter was perfect.

The restaurant was very dark, which I liked, but the washrooms were entirely too dark...honestly you need a flashlight to navigate it.  It didn't help that toilet seats are also black, so you can't see a thing.

They validate parking at a reduced rate of $25, but I could imagine anyone dining there doesn't have to worry about price.  A nice man suggested parking immediately east of the hotel in the Scotiabank garage for even easier parking."}
{"text":"Was here with a friend for Summerlicious the previous weekend, and I must say that it was one of the absolute best restaurant experiences I have had in Toronto.
The atmosphere was beautiful with the restaurant's high ceiling and beautiful view atop the Trump Hotel and Towers, the service was excellent, and the food was delicious. Great value, great food!"}
{"text":"Toronto's new business power breakfast meet-up for the business community. Decadent without being overly priced with tremendous first class service."}
{"text":"I went there last night for my friend's birthday. I don't think I will ever go back again. 

Decor/ View: Nice, very stylish and chic. Missing a good view though, since the restaurant is only on the 31st floor.

Service: NOT OK at all! We ordered a bottle of wine to be shared amongst the table. Our table ordered our food + wine around the same time as the table next to us with the same server. We saw that the table next to us got their wine right after they ordered (which is normal), but our table did not get our wine until our food came (not normal)! I don't understand why it took so long to get a bottle of wine for us! One of my friend in the table got the amuse-bouche that was compliment of the chef, while the rest of us got it delivered to us literally 10 mins after.  ALSO, throughout the whole dinner, we saw that the waiter frequently visited the table next to us to ask how their food was, and topping up their wine. HOWEVER, that never happened for us. Not only did they not come back ask how our food was, I had to pour the wine for my friends when their glass was done. HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN? When the waiter saw that I was pouring my own wine, he came over and said \"Oh, I didn't know there were still wine left!\" .. oh yeah, if there was no wine left in the bottle, why would you put it in the ice bucket next to our table? This does not make senses, and what a stupid excuse that the waiter gave! He should have offered to help me pour the wine because when he came over, I did not start to pour yet. BUT HE DID NOT and just walked away. Anyways, at the end of the night, we told the waiter that it was our friend's birthday when we were ordering dessert. The waiter said \"ok, we can only put a candle on your dessert, that's all we do\" ... ok? We were not bagging for free dessert! When they put the dessert down on the table, they put it in front of my other friend, and not the birthday friend even though we pointed her out when we were ordering. Ok ... fine. We keep eating, we are capable of swapping plates if we are capable of pouring our own wine. But GUESS WHAT? We heard 2 waiters singing a birthday song to the lady sitting in the table next to our's .. ! Why didn't we get any of that? The only explanation we have is that we did not look \"rich\" enough to get respectable service from the waiter. 

Food: Very \"so-so\". I could have had the same thing in any other restaurant, even at half of the price. There was not a single thing on the menu that was unique/ exciting.

You know what? There were other people that were very pleasant to us at the hotel, but I think our waiter ruined everything. I don't think I will ever go there again.

PS: waiter's name is Colin T."}
{"text":"The summerlicious dinner menu was decent with some good seafood choices. Our table mainly ordered the scallop and salmon ceviche appetizer - salmon was good but I found the scallops tasted a little too fishy. I ordered the sea bream and calamari main course which I enjoyed. The fish skin was nice and crispy and the dish was well seasoned. The sweet and savory dessert was a little disappointing as the peach macaroon had no peach taste and the cookie shells were too dense but the truffle with raspberry filling was good. Had an average overall dining experience but may come back for their patio seating one day for the view."}
{"text":"fancy schmancy is definitely an understatment!
Lets just say everything is TOUCHLESS even before you hit the revolving doors as there's someone already spinning it for you.  
Their restaurant on the 30th floor is quite exquisite, and you definitely feel like you've entered into the upper echeleons of society.  Their drinks are smooth yet strong, and the hostesses are always available to assist you."}
{"text":"The service was great. The food was pretty good.
I would have given Stock a rating between three and four.  I ended up giving it a four.  The service was outstanding.  Everyone was very friendly and the service was very professional.  On the way out they even give you a small gift item.  I won't ruin it for you :)

I visited here for Winterlicious lunch.  The soup looked pretty good.  I had the steak tartar.  The tartar was a bit disappointing.  It could have done with more topping.  There was some flavour but they were tiny drops on an otherwise giant flat puck of meat. The Pork Belly was good.  Much more meat and a lot less fat than i expected which is a good thing.  I actually expected a thin piece of skin on a layer of fat, on a sliver of dried out meat but i was glad when i was proven wrong... that sure was a lot of meat... :)

All the desserts looked great.  I had the chocolate mousse... :)"}
{"text":"I came here on a date with my boyfriend for Summerlicious.  These were the dishes we ordered:

-Golden Gazpacho Soup:  blue crab, tarragon greek yogurt
-Tiger Shrimp Ceviche: edamame, avocado, cucumber, mint, basil, lime
-Woolwich Township Short Rib: celeriac purée, cabernet jus
-Skin Roasted Georgian Bay Pickerel: organic quinoa, fennel & rosé grapefruit crudo, toasted seeds
-Summertime Coconut Panna Cotta: sun-ripened fruits, strawberry nage, pistachio tuile

Everything was delicious, but the best was certainly the short rib that just melted in your mouth.  

The service was friendly and welcoming.  It really made you feel like a millionaire.  We ate on the upper level, which would be great for private parties.  It had a beautiful view of the financial district on one side, and a balcony over the main floor on the other."}
{"text":"Had lunch here for winterlicious and thought the food was great. I mean, $25 for a 3 course lunch here is a steal. 

Our party of 3 had ordered pretty much one of each item from the menu. Service was a little slow but it really didn't bother us as much as it meant more time talking. 

Will be back ... during winterlicious only :p"}
{"text":"3.5

The decor at this place was very nice. They have a massive plastered decorated wall on the back and a very nice bar area. They always have an outdoor bar patio which overlooks the Fianancial District since this place is on the 31st floor. The only problem is, the waterfront is blocked by all the surrounding buildings. It does give you a good view of the construction at Union Station though lol. If a view is what you're looking for, I suggest Canoe.

The food here was good. We came for the Summerlicious lunch menu. It was a good meal priced at $25. 

Appetizer: Cured Atlantic Salmon. This wasn't my favourite. The ingredients on this plate lacked harmony and I didn't understand the popcorn. There was hardly enough of the avocado creme fraiche and just a little too much cilantro for my taste. Not to mention, mine was missing chile peppers that was apparent on everyone else's at the table.

Main: Grilled Angus Flat Iron Steak & Summer Ratatouille. Ok, I'll be honest, after not liking the app, I wasn't expecting much out of this. But it came out and not only did it look amazing, it tasted great too. Served on a warm slate, cooked to a perfect medium rare, great portion size. The ratatouille was a nice side, and it came with some roasted new potatoes and some mustard as well. 

Dessert: Strawberry Pavlova. I was going to order the Flourless Cake until I saw Chantilly Cream in this description. Up till this point, I wasn't too full. I thought I could eat some more steak but this thing was so big and so good. The strawbery rhubarb was sweet and tangy, and the merangue was nice and crunchy and the chantilly cream was nice and light tasting. You have to get a little bit of everything in one bite to make this work, and work it does. It was pretty good.

Overall, this was a good meal for $25. I don't think I would come here and pay regular price though. Recommended for Winterlicious or Summerlicious.

Also, the bar area is super nice. I didn't have any drinks since it was lunch time during a work day, but if you were to come here for drinks, I would say you won't be disappointed.

As for the service, it was alright. One of the guys spilled water on me and didn't even notice and bread is only upon request. And came with a spicy hummus instead of butter. A little strange."}
{"text":"Hy husband and I came here for their summerlicious and I thought the food was outstanding. I had chilled pea soup and homemade ravioli and ricotta. The service was fantastic and the dessert was fresh. I wouldn't expect anything less from a restaurant in the Trump Tower. I did share with others photos of my meal and they thought the portions were too small, but I was okay with them. I would recommend going during summerlicious when the prices are more affordable. Regrettably, we didn't score a seat next to the window, but we could 'see' outside and it's always cool eating up in the sky. Same kinda effect as Panorama, 360, etc..."}
{"text":"shoot me now... 

got dragged here for a work function and I should have gnawed my own foot off to get out of the experience....

work is work so once in a while you have to do the Thursday rounds and hit the bay street circuit but I duck out when it comes time to grab dinner... but we had clients in so there was no escaping it.... they suggested the trump...

first off, the attitude at the hostess stand was horrendous... so what if we came in at 930pm looking for dinner??? if youre open youre open... and if you can seat us, great... if not just let us know and we can move along... 10 min of humming and double checking with the girl looking at us like we were asking to steal her puppy...

second, this is not a steak house... we all ordered steaks... had no prblm with the price cause we assumed at those prices they would know what they were doing and using great quality suppliers... Fail on both sides.... out of 7 ppl only 2 finished their steaks (the 2 fillets....) the rest of us gave up... either too gristly or waaaay too over done...

90min of saying \"its not that bad\" or \"the sides are tasty\" kinda killed the mood.... 

Third, what the fuck is up with the music being that loud??? its a Thursday! im having dinner!!! its costing me $150 a plate, I don't need house beats drowning out the conversation...

if youre looking to entertain clients and you have to stick to the core try Blowfish on bay, or Hys, Ki or even one of the Dukes pubs... any wheres better than this..."}
{"text":"I started off my Summerlicious adventures here and it was well worth it, even for dinner! I thought the service was good -- sometimes, the high end places don't treat Summerlicious/Winterlicious diners as well -- but that wasn't an issue here. 

The salmon/scallop ceviche (appetizer) was an incredible start to the meal. I usually shy away from raw seafood but I loved every bite of the ceviche. It was seasoned well, with a good balance of salt and lemon and the variety of texture in the dish was stunning -- there were some leaves and puree, and even popcorn. The ravioli looked underwhelming at first but the lemon zest and oyster mushrooms brought out the creaminess of the ricotta and proved enough to fill me up, but not stuff me. I tried the chicken as well and found it juicy and tender without being overwhelming.

The dessert was every bit as lovely as the first two courses were. The flourless fudge cake was rich and the accompanying cherries were an ideal sour complement. A word of warning for anyone who has had pavlova in NZ or Australia -- this is not quite the same! It was basically meringues served with strawberry preserves, etc. The sweet and savoury consisted of some aged cheddar, a surprising truffle, and a macaron. I loved the former two but the latter didn't quite measure up to my expectations.

Overall, it was a great experience. Parking in the hotel is available for $10 for restaurant patrons. It is worth taking a good look or two at the restaurant décor, though the view isn't really noteworthy. I would consider returning for the regular menu for a special event -- particularly as a substitute to Canoe or the CN Tower."}
{"text":"I want to be fair in this review and mention that the restaurant opened in the last week and a half, so there are undoubtedly a few details that have yet to be worked out.

The restaurant space is stunning; it features high ceilings and a view from the 31st floor (if you sit close to the window). Lighting and finishing touches make for a gorgeous space.

Unfortunately there are a few key details that made our dining experience less than enjoyable:

- The noise level here is very loud. It's nearly impossible to carry on a conversation from across the table because the music is so loud. I think the high ceilings might also make this problem worse.

- The tables are spaced too closely together. In some cases there really isn't room for waitstaff to maneuver properly to pour drinks or set down plates, and it's hard to squeeze by other patrons without knocking something over.

- The menu is not really Vegan or Vegetarian friendly, and offers few gluten-free options. This is probably not an issue for the majority of diners, but it was a big problem for us. An impromptu concoction prepared for my gluten-intolerant husband wasn't substantial enough for an entrée as the chef didn't appear to hold any awareness of Vegan or Vegetarian protein sources.

- Service was slow due to high volume. We were served approximately an hour and a half after being seated.

- The chef seems very enthusiastic about using chilies and salt. My order of Mediterranean sea bass was best described as \"tastes like burning\". I explained this to my server, but I soldiered on to finish about half the dish out of sheer  hunger (having already waited so long).

- Our server was friendly but a bit too informal for comfort. He could probably have made us very happy by not charging us for an order that was mixed up, but I had to request that to be taken off. 

- The real reason I wanted to dine here was to try \"the chocolate lab\" for dessert. By the end of our ordeal, I lost my appetite and I would have gladly left before our entrees arrived if I'd had the choice. 

I think STOCK has the potential to be a truly great restaurant. The look and feel of the place is promising, but service delivery standards and noise levels need better management. I'm not sure why one of the sections was closed off but I would have liked to have sat there since it looked much quieter.

Promoting ultra high-end dining means living up to ultra high-end standards."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty generic A.K.A. nothing you can't get at Milestone.  However, the restaurant itself and the bar area are beautiful -- high ceiling, modern furniture, chic decor, and not over-crowded seating arrangements.  I came here for lunch and got a window table; the view was beautiful; I can only imagine how much nicer it will be at night.  I would come here again on a romantic date for a few drinks (which are reasonably priced at $9) but the food was forgettable."}
{"text":"A friend recommended we try out this spot for lunch on a Wednesday and that's exactly what we did, two moms and a baby. The black and white decor with wall motifs and chandelier inspirations throughout help set the stage for a classy lunch. It was empty when I got there at 11:45 but by 12:15 it was booked up. Despite being on the 31st floor you did not get a chance to enjoy the scenary.. 

Mainly suits surrounded us....with a hot dog costing $26 you's expect a lot company credit cards being tossed around. The staff were very attentive and even went out of their way to get a high chair for us even though we were fine keeping the car seat on the floor. Note there is no place to change a baby in the washrooms. 

The food was fabulous, my hot dog had a big frank that was topped with shredded rib meat. My friend had the burger and said it was hands down the best burger she's ever had. While we waited for dessert they brought us some complementary gold dusted chocolate almonds and chocolate krisps. A burger, a hot dog, one dessert, 2 glasses of wine and a cider came up to $125. They do charge you $2 per pitcher of tap water which was odd.

My only issue was that one particular wait staff who got me my cider (which was sold by the glass) tried numerous times to top up my glass since it apparently came by the bottle. I politely declined two times and on the third I explained that I'm breastfeeding so one glass was all I could have before the next feed. Didn't stop him from trying to top it off again... my friend then told him to PLEASE take the bottle away and not bring it back. That did the trick! 

I'd definitely go back ....but hopefully on a business lunch !"}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Stock for lunch yesterday.  After reading the reviews, I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant.  

Decor/Ambience:   We were seated upstairs and the view was excellent.  I didn't find the restaurant too noisy as other reviews had mentioned.  I loved the black and white decor.  Very modern and hip.  

Food/Drinks:   We asked for a cocktail list but were told that the bartenders were \"retooling it\" and one was not available.  The server could not help us with any cocktail selections or the restaurants signature cocktail (if any) and simply offered us \"vodka and soda\" which neither of us like.  We ended up ordering two Cosmos which were pretty to look at and came in a large martini glass but I couldn't taste the alcohol at all.  It just tasted like juice.  Disappointing.  

For appetizers, we ordered the Chicken pelmeni soup with mini dumplings, chicken broth and fresh chilies to share.  It was nice of the kitchen to split the soup for us.  The soup was light and slightly spicy and was a perfect way to start the meal on a winter day.  The mini pelmeni (dumplings) brought my dining companion and I both back to our Ukrainian roots. 

We also shared the Burrata (a huge portion).  It was very rich and creamy.  I love Burrata so I enjoyed it overall but I had to add a little salt as I felt the dish was under-seasoned.  

I had read a review about the beef short ribs and it sounded so good I wanted to try it so I ordered the Wagyu hot dog with short ribs thinking that this must have been the same dish but it could not possibly have been.  They either must have changed the menu or it must be on the dinner menu because what arrived was essentially a beef hot dog split down the middle on a huge bun (see picture) with some shredded beef on top.  The shredded beef was tasty but I didn't want the bun so I just tried to eat the hot dog with the beef but all I could taste was the overpowering taste of the hot dog.  For a high-end place like this, I don't think this dish cuts it.  I really didn't enjoy it very much at all.  The side of fries was tasty but it didn't redeem the dish for me.  

My friend ordered the organic coho salmon which came on a bed of quinoa.  The piece of salmon was huge and was cooked perfectly.  It was amazing - very tender.  Salmon has not been my favourite fish lately but I would definitely order this in the future.  

Service:  I had advised our server that I had to be back at work around 2 p.m..  As a result, he was very prompt in having our meals delivered which was a pleasant surprise since this is not always the case in a high-end restaurants.  However, we had to ask him if he could bring our bottle of wine to our table since he was spending so much time with other tables that our glasses sat empty for a long time.  Despite this, I had felt that he had redeemed himself since, by the time 1:40 pm rolled around, we had already finished our mains and decided to look at the dessert menu to see if we wanted to share anything.  We also hoped to order coffee but our server never came back to our table with the menu nor did he take our coffee order so we did not get the chance to try a dessert or have coffee and by the time 2 p.m. came around, he showed up, admitting that it was awful of horrible him not to have brought us a dessert menu or ask us if we wanted to coffee.  Disappointing.  

Summary:  I would have given this restaurant 3 1/2 stars if I could have.  I was disappointed with the service and with my entree but I enjoyed the rest of the food and the ambiance enough to know I will want to come back in the hopes that the problems with the service and the drink menu will be ironed out by next time."}
{"text":"Upon arrival, me and my boyfriend immediately felt out of place. We're both university students and the setting was just extremely intimidating. Everything was most black, silver, with a lot of glass, and while the entire thing looked spectacular, it wasn't a very inviting setting to be in where we could be comfortable - it came off as stiff and professional. Their choice in music was great.

 Our reservation was at 1:30 PM for lunch and the entire restaurant had about 7 or 8 other diners on a Saturday. The hostess and waiter were both very accommodating and polite, which we noted with appreciation. There's a coat check and they offer you a stand for your bag. The view outside is nice, but because of the lounge, you can't peer down into the street meaning that there are only building tops visible.

The food .. well, for an appetizer, we ordered the East Blue Crab. It came with some nice crisps, guac, and the crab. The crab was fresh and the crisps were tangy - something we enjoyed. The guac, however, had too much lime and was very sour which didn't compliment the dish. 

For our entrees, my boyfriend ordered the Steak and Egg while I opted for the Braised Lamb of Shank. His Steak and Egg was decent and at a fair price, although I would probably want to go somewhere else for a steak. My braised lamb, however, was absolutely flavorless. It was beyond tender and the vegetables in the dish tasted great,  but the meat literally had no flavor whatsoever which left me disappointed. I didn't even end up finishing half of the entire dish.

The desserts looked splendid, but I wasn't in the mood for eating dessert after such a disappointing entree, so we took our leave. 

Overall, don't come here if you're unwilling to drop $100+ for lunch for only okay food, but great service."}
{"text":"Service is a bit slow... Had to wait 30 minutes to order food... 

Food is pretty yummy! Had their truffle popcorn, a bit too buttery for my liking, truffle fries, which were amazing and their truffle Mac and Cheese, which was okay...wish there was more cheese on the top/less milky.

Ordered the scallops for my main meal... Scallops were huge and flavorful, the risotto that with it was okay... Could've used a bit more flavor.

Wine is excellent! Definitely recommend their Sauvignon Blanc!"}
{"text":"I'd never been in a Trump Tower before, so when a buddy mentioned having dinner on the 31st floor, I expected three 3 things: 1) fantastic food with exceptional service, 2) great views and 3) a pricey experience.

Here's the rundown:
 - The views are meh, but the atmosphere was solid
 - It is pricey to come here, but that's as expected
 - Service was excellent at the bar
 - The tartare was easily the best thing I had and I'd come back here just for tartare and a drink
 - Steak was average along with the fries
 - Kale salad was good

Probably a good option if you're staying here, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Went to Stock on a Saturday night and was very happy with the evening.  The restaurant itself feels almost like a club and plays fairly loud music all night.  We were there late into the evening and the entire time the place was packed.  There is also a bar/lounge area that was completely full.  I found this kind of odd and I felt like the lounge kind of ruins the dining room experience on the first floor.  The decor is very modern and nice on the inside.  Service was very attentive and we did not wait long for food or drinks.

The Food - Overall everything was very good and cooked perfectly.  Nothing really blew my mind so I can only give it 8/10.

Arugula & cellar roots salad: 8.5/10 Very nice light salad.  Vegetables were niceloy cooked with some delicious chevre on top.
Burrata & fire roasted sweet peppers: 7/10 The burrata as always was delicious, but the peppers were pretty ordinary.  We had just been to Campagnolo where the burrata is served warm and I think this dish would have been better served hot.
Baked organic coho salmon: 8/10 this was a very large piece of salmon with quinoa and asparagus.  All cooked perfectly but the flavour didn't blow my mind.
Ricotta ravioli & wild mushrooms: 8.5/10 Nice filling with very good homeade pasta.  Very nice sauce, but overall did not blow my mind.
Warm dark chocolate tart: 8/10 Fairly small tart so the chocolate didn't ooze out like I expected.  The mint ice cream was delicious.
3 cheese plate:  9/10 Fairly small portion, but all 3 cheeses were absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times. The food is good, but not that good it's worth paying what they charge for it. The macaroni is an excellent side dish. The chocolate dessert platter is really good too. 

The decor is borderline tacky and over done. I can see this place going bankrupt in 3-5 years. The vibe is very financial district and make sure you get there early if you want drinks in the lounge because it's always packed during the week.

My friend and I crashed some event that was happening on the 10th floor one night. The sliders, sushi and mini -portioned food they served there was amazing, but since then I haven't tasted anything like it.

My fave thing about this place is the truffle flavoured popcorn and the cute \"mixologist\" Josh. Worth checking out for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant.
We ordered the Summerlicous Lunch Menu. 25 dollars including app, main and desserts.
The service was perfect and the waitress was very considerate. The app was salmon with grapefruit juice and veg, which was fantastic. The main course Iron Steak looked like an artwork. Raw stone shaped-plate with colorful tomatoes, olives, peppers, sauces. Dessert savory and sweet was excellent too. From left-hand side to the right, from the 10-year cheddar cheese to the very end macaron, your taste buds were refreshing again and again."}
{"text":"My first impression walking into the Trump Tower was \"WOWWW... hey, I'd love to stay here for a while\". It's decor was classy without being ostentatious. My S.O. and I boarded the elevator for our lunch date. We picked from the Summerlicious menu and an additional appetizer off of the a la carte menu. In an attempt to taste as many dishes as we could we ordered the Seared Fois Gras from the a la carte, the 100km Spinach Salad, Citrus-cured Atlantic Salmon, Pan Seared Royal Sea Bream, Grilled Angus Flat Iron Steak & Summer Ratatouille, Strawberry Pavlova, and the Sweet & Savoury.

Seared Fois Gras: Honestly, a little bit of a disappointment. I've had better. It was slightly undercooked and a bit watery. Considering it was $24, it was nearly the price we paid for each Summerlicious seating.

100km Spinach Salad: Nice and light, the dressing didn't drown the salad and it was well balanced.

Citrus-cured Atlantic Salmon: I felt like this dish was a bit confused with bits of popcorn around the side of a nicely presented salmon ceviche. While the salmon was nicely prepared, the popcorn really threw this otherwise perfect dish off.

Pan Seared Royal Sea Bream: This was, for me, the saving grace. Beautifully crispy skin, very succulent and flaky. Perfectly cooked on a bed of well seasoned couscous salad. Definitely recommend this dish to any of the fish lovers out there.

Grilled Angus Flat Iron Steak: The cook on this meat was amazing. Perfectly medium rare. Not much to improve on here but (and I am being slightly picky on this) I found the mustard seeds to be slightly overpowering, not entirely drowning out the taste of the meat but getting close to it. Otherwise, perfectly seasoned.

Strawberry Pavlova: The mix of the strawberry and rhubarb is a classic. Mixed with hints of mint, it was a very nice dessert to cleanse the palate. Nice and light.

Sweet and Savoury: This was a bit of a miss for me. The peach macaron was dry and brittle. Not at all what I was expecting to get from a macaron where you have a crispy outside shell and a soft center. They might have well stuck two peach biscuits together and called it a macaron. The cheese was good though, and so was the black current truffle.

The service was nice, polite, friendly, and attentive. They're not the type to pester you too much during dinner which I like because I do enjoy a certain degree of privacy.

All in all the experience was alright, for the price you pay it's a pretty good deal to go for Summerlicious. I probably wouldn't recommend coming here during the regular a la carte menu just based on the price to quality aspect."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Stock for Summerlicious. Scott was our server and he was fantastic. He was extremely knowledgable about the menu options and the wine selections. I chose to do the wine pairings which was a great option. The portion sizes for Summerlicious were generous and well prepared. I will definitely dine at Stock again."}
{"text":"I sort of gave up on Licious for a while now since it have been a disappointments after disappointments these past few years. But a friend suggested we try Stock Restaurant (@STOCKToronto) Summerlicious (@LiciousTO) $45 Dinner menu and why not, I am always up for an opportunity to catch up with friends. 

 I was originally very excited to try out Stock since they have a pretty active Twitter account but I couldn't say the same about their service.

 It all started out perfect, from pulling my chair to providing a side folding purse holder. Then we were quickly ask if we wanted anything to drink but clearly the drink menu / wine list was missing. We were only provided with the summerlicious cheers menu below with a few cocktail and beer choices. Then as the drink arrives, one miss after the other. Starting with my friend's cocktail which had a hair on the fruit garnish....
 ....then all 3 glasses of beer ordered arrived in the same water glasses that was already on the table. At a high end lounge and bar like these, I expected drinks to come in their appropriate glass/stemware
 I order a 1/2 bottle of white and after drinking a few sips, our waiter came over to check on my glass... apparently they notice from afar that there was a chip and instead of pouring me a new glass, they just pour the wine into another glass right in front of us. 
Then during dinner, they never came to refill my glass while the bottle was out of my reach in an ice bucket in a corner. Neither did they came to ask if anyone needed another drink.
Enough said, these are enough to ruin any restaurant experience.

Tiger Shrimp Ceviche
~ endamame, avocado, cucumber, mint, basil, lime
~ Overcook shrimp with not so ceviche / citrusy tasting dish and an outdated presentation

 Dolce Lucano's Stracciatella
~ pingue prosciutto, cantaloupe, crostini

 Golden Gazpacho Soup
~ blue crab, tarragon greek yogurt
~ This was refreshing for a hot day but in the end nothing really special.

 72 Hour Woolwich Township Short Rib
~ celeriac puree, cabernet jus
~ Good, fall off the bone, tender but it was the standard and you could probably get the same thing if not better at some dozen other restaurant.

 Seared Deep Sea Scallops & Sugar Cane Pork Belly
~ green mango & peanut salad, caledon apple
~ The slaw/salad was rather cold which made the pork belly that was sitting on top of it rather cold as well and personally I don't think it even went well with the dish.

 Skin Roasted Georgian Bay Pickerel
~ organic quinoa, fennel & rose grapefruit crudo, toasted pumpkin seeds
~ Didn't taste this one but as per my friend, it was slightly overcooked but loved the quinoa side.

 Please note that we weren't asked if we need another drink, we were nit asked if coffee or tea was needed either. The dishes just came one after the other without anyone checking on us in between.

Grand Cru Caribe Dark Chocolate Fondant
~ roasted almond streusel, salted java caramel, chantilly cream
~ Overall very sweet, wish they use dark chocolate with the caramel. It was a dessert that me and the bf couldn't finish.

 Summertime Coconut Panna Cotta
~ sun-ripened fruit, strawberry nage, pistachio tuile
 ~ Try a bit from my friend's and this was probably the best dessert out of the 3. Smooth, light and refreshing with the coconut flavor.

 Lemon Meringue Tart
~ wild blueberry preserve, casis pearls, honey creme fraiche
~ Another overly sweet dessert, wish it was more lemony / tart but i love the pie crust

 Verdict:
~ This made me loose further faith in Licious
~ While I didn't have very high expectation for the food, I was expecting top notch service which I didn't get."}
{"text":"We came to Stock Restaurant on the 31st floor of the Trump Tower this past Saturday night.  
Tiger Shrimp Ceviche - Interesting... served in a martini glass, it was okay.  Didn't blow my socks off.  Difficult to eat, we all made a mess.  
Pork Belly and Scallops - The pork was delicious, Scallops were okay, nothing special.  And there was sort sort of kimchi served with this.  Found it an odd mix.  But the pork belly was excellent.  
Lemon Meringue Tart - this was actually the best part of dinner.  It was fantastic.  
The Trump Tower is a beautiful building and this restaurant is the same.  It was great.  The service was fantastic, friendly knowledgeable.  The bathrooms in both the restaurant and the hotel ground floor are to die for... I love using a polished black toilet.  I feel like James Bond using that baby!  
Now... 5 minutes after we had finished our desserts, the waiter simply puts the bill on the table and thanks us.  Didn't ask us if we wanted anything else.  No offer of coffee or espresso or anything.  I found this a little unusual, and distinctly got the impression that he wanted us out of there, likely so he could fill the table again.  It kind of left a bad taste in my mouth.  
Sort of like \"Okay... you've seen what you needed to see.... Now get out\"
Overall... good meal, but I was hoping for a little more WOW... like I have experienced during other \"licious\" events (Rosewater blew me away!)"}
