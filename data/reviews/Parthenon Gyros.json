{"text":"I bought a gyro but don't eat gyros so I won't comment on the food. the cashier was really nice and the rooftop was so cool! I would try it out if I were you"}
{"text":"Awesome.  Just awesome.  The gyro meat is made the way it should be and shaved off when you order.  Its a messy, greasy bundle of deliciousness.  And the fries are good too."}
{"text":"Favorite place to eat in Madison. Enjoy sitting in the outside area above the eatery on a warm sunny weekend afternoon. Don't know how it happened, just a tradition."}
{"text":"For Madison Standards this place is good with reasonable prices and very friendly service."}
{"text":"Hate the service, very bias, always trying to take advantage of drunk person, not a good way to give your own self a tip?  I don't know how the day staffs are, but this is mostly between 1-2am on the weekend.  I have been there 3 times and all these time, i was tricked or made me look stupid. Never going back again.  I can get my fries some place else.  Your not the only place that serves fries? You guys need better staffs, especially at night.  Some one who need to do their job, which is to serve us, not to ruin our night?"}
{"text":"Pretty good. There are not many other quality gyros restaurants in Madison. Your only other choice is really Athens Gyros in the West Towne Mall, but then you have to eat in the mall foodcourt. Both restaurants are really good though. Be aware that they will be confused at Parthenon if you try to order a gyro with chicken instead - I guess it's not a gyro without lamb."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to get gyros in wisconsin or northern Illinois. This place has a cult following and for good reason- food is amazing, large portions, decent prices, right on state street, outside, inside and roof top seating, one of the last family run places on state street, and you can always tell that the employees love working there. I just plain love it. Nothing compares... this is also a childhood favorite of mine."}
{"text":"Repeat after me:  when I am drunk and staggering, there is NOTHING better than a Gyro and fries.  And, unless you're a dolt, you just order WATER, you hear me!  Its messy, delicious and now even meets most health codes...but it lost a lot of character when they remodeled.  But even though there's enough plastic for a couple of McDonald's here, it still retains its essential Greekiness...even though the staff is now nearly completely Latino!!  Still have lots of Catsup with your fries, let the sauce run over your fingers and eat ALL those onions, you're not going to be kissing anyone this morning anyhow!"}
{"text":"Best cold gyro I ever had.  Unfortunately, I wanted a hot one, full of succulent juicy meats.  Service was fine, lunch rush was over.  I ordered two gyros and a large soda.  I nearly fell over when they said that was going to set me back $16.  Seems a bit pricey to me, but I needed my gyro fix.    At first I thought it was the ice cold tomoatoes that were making the whole thing seem cold, so I took them all off; unfortunately, it didn't help.  The meat wasn't fresh from the spit; it was taken from a tray on the prep area, but since they were slicing meat when I came in I thought it would be OK.  The meat was tasty enough and so was the tatziki, but the whole thing being completely cold really ruined it for me."}
{"text":"Stopped in last weekend. The gyro and fries were both excellent. Parthenon is still my favorite place for a gyro and fries (and has been for decades)."}
{"text":"Practically perfect in every way. Big portions, INCREDIBLE food, and fast service. The best gyros I've ever had anywhere, and I've been to many, many places."}
{"text":"Food can't reach average quality, fries are soggy and for two it ended up being $30. It's not bad for drunken accident food but if your not blackout it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"I was new to the area and was hoping that this place would offer soemwhat good greek gyros. This place sucks, I would never go back. Their gyros were disgusting, I don't even want to know what the gyro meat was made from, it looked like a cardboard composite. I'm sure it's wonderful for drunk college kids, but not for anyone sober. No thanks. Besides, these are all made by persons whom definately aren't  even somewhat greek at all."}
{"text":"My mom used to take me here when I was just a little guy.  I barely even remembered it (I remember getting gyros from time to time), and then I was home in Wisconsin visiting this past Christmastime and we went to the Parthenon.  I instantly remembered it and the awesome gyros.  Their fries are also really awesome.  So, needless to say, I plan on going back to the Parthenon pretty much every time I'm in Madison ever again."}
{"text":"I first ate here in the early 1980's, and they still have the best damn gyro around. I'd have posted a picture of the delicious one I had tonight, but there's no time for picture takin' when there's a Parthenon gyro in front of you."}
{"text":"I agree with the last reviewer.  I have been coming here for decades and always felt that their gyros were the gold standard.  I went there last night with my kids and something was not the same.  The pita was perfect, the sauce was the same, but the onions and the meat seemed different.  The onions were cut very thin, paper thin--they used to be thicker.  They also had a slightly bitter taste, which I don't previously recall. The tomatoes were mealy--so much so that I had to take them off.   The meat also seemed different as well. It's hard to put my finger on it, but as I was eating it, I thought to myself \"this is what baloney would taste like if it was made with lamb...\"  Not the Parthenon I remember."}
{"text":"Parthenon has the best gyros and fries I've ever tasted. That's all I can say. Blabalabalabalabalabalaba. Only adding this cuz apparently my review is too short"}
{"text":"Since I'm a newer Madison resident, I'm not sure how much better this State Street gyro spot was in the good old days. However, I've become quite hooked. This is a late night gyro joint and not fine Mediterranean dining.   The regular gyro is okay (and the Hercules plate is quite the haul), but what I always get now is the Chick-n-Bob, or chicken kebab with fries. The chicken is seasoned, grilled, and served on skewers in a big warm pita with delicious, tangy tzatziki sauce, tomatoes, and onions. It's filling and lovely. And the fries are incredibly good. Crispy on the outside and softer on the inside (except for the super crunchy fries on the bottom of the basket; there are always some). Have yet to sample the baklava.  Service is friendly and down-to-earth. The interior is pretty fast food-like, but I like the rooftop garden in the warm months. There's always Greek music videos playing and there's ouzo, too.  Admittedly, paying $9.25 for a chicken kebab and fries feels a little steep. It would also be nice to have more specials/deals on food now and then."}
{"text":"What happened to the beloved Parthenon.  Just ate there at 6:30 on our first 70 plus day of the spring.  With a jam packed state street we made our way to one of our favorite stops in Madtown.  The wait for our gyro was uncomfortably long.  It was as if the guys behind the counter had forgotten that their quick delivery and continual shouts for gyro and fries, gyro no tomato, Pepsi, Pepsi Pepsi were a big part of the experience.  Sandwich was still solid but it just didn't feel like the Parthenon's we remember fondly.  I'll be back, I hope Parthenon's is too."}
{"text":"Some of the best gyros I have tasted, at least here in America.  When ever I visit Madison, this is one the places I must eat at.  This place is perfect to line your tummy after a night of drinking. This place hits the spot and can be a very fun place too."}
{"text":"Amazing Customer Service...Great Food..Love the sauce and onions S0 fresh! Love the rooftop and the cleanliness of the place. Also Love the music and the videos that are always playing really sets the mood in the environment, By far my favorite Gyro Place in Madison! I grew up eating this food and So will my kids!"}
{"text":"Best gyros around, no question. This is a Madison classic that shouldn't be missed. While the setting leaves something to desired, it's always been worth waiting through the lines, under flourescent lights, listening to loud students carrying on. Counter service, not particularly clean, but strictly about food. Large multi-story restaurant.  I've only ordered gyros and gyro platters, but many of them; maybe a soda every few years. Must get extra tzatziki to compliment the perfectly overfilled pitas.  I typically go at late hours, either after a long night of bar hopping, a bachelorette party, birthday party, or for some reason after trips to the ER. It's a good tradition to consider. You won't be alone late at night, as this is one of very few places open so late into the night."}
{"text":"We came in here around 8:00 p.m. really wanting gyros but ended up being disappointed. The meat was dry and salty, and the bread was soaked in oil. The fries were the only decent part. I would not come back and not reccomend."}
{"text":"The worst gyro we ever had. Bad service. Very dirty place. Gross bathrooms. Use to be a good place before, not anymore. Stay away..."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a little kid and love it. I only gave it 3 stars because I feel the quality of the food isn't as good as it used it be. For one thing the pita bread itself is smaller. The lamb and fries are hit and miss but when you get a crazing for a gyro this is your place."}
{"text":"The chicken caesar sandwich was very good! This is about as tasty as a gyros place can be."}
{"text":"Excellent gyros and tzatziki sauce.... onion breath is expected"}
{"text":"This is a pretty awesome hidden in plain site gem. My gyro meat could use a little less salt and less cucumber sauce but other than that I was completely satisfied. The staff was super helpful when ordering.  I'll definitely be back to try other options on the menu... oh and they have wine"}
{"text":"In the young, naive days before I discovered the joy of gyros, this place was just a late night grub and Greek mafia money laundering joint. Rooftop patio which was cool (but not in the winter when it would have been *very* cool)."}
{"text":"If you know anything at all about gyros, you know this place is the best! Always packed and in demand, it really becomes an addiction! 5stars!"}
{"text":"The best gyro outside of Austria. They use real lamb beef. Combo here not the processed crap you get in Milwaukee or Chicago."}
{"text":"UUUMMMM!!!  That one word sums it up.  I don't live downtown anymore, but this is still my treat place.  Best gyros, good fries & even better: GREAT hours.  The trick is to go at bar time, the meat is the freshest:-)"}
{"text":"Parthenon Gyros are the best!  Nothing is better late at night or even just having a sober meal with freinds than a Gyro - Fry- Pepsi!  If you have had Gyros before and never had Parthenon...then you have not had a real Gyro!  During the warm months enjoy the roof garden!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  It was worth the ride from Illinois!  Best gyros around and cool, authentic atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place.  I honestly can't imagine why it isn't rated better on Yelp.  It is the *only* place I recommend for gyros, and I certainly can't get enough, and here's why...   Unlike other restaurants offering gyros in the Madison area, that order their gyro meat in from other companies in an already frozen cone, everything involved in making Parthenon's gyro meat is done in-house.  And I mean, everything - it is an absolutely awesome process.  They believe in quality ingredients and use only quality, locally sourced lamb and beef to make their gyros, meaning... *no fillers*.  Additionally, if you want the best Tzatziki sauce you've ever had in your life (also made *completely* in house)... look no further!  Parthenon's is the only place in Madison with a license to make their greek yogurt in house and it makes all the difference in the world.    Their current staff is flawless and friendly, and the owners are two of the loveliest people you'll meet.  They really take pride in what they do, and the love they put into running their business really shows.    Also, did I mention they are open super late?  Because, let's face it.  Who doesn't want a hot, delicious, homemade gyro at 2AM. ;)   All of this is what really sets Parthenon's apart from other places offering gyros around the Madison area.  Moral of the story....DO IT. :) :)"}
{"text":"Went in with pretty tempered expectations considering the Yelp reviews. I just really wanted a gyro, and I haven't really been pleased by any of the ones I've tried thus far in Madison. This was easily the best gyro I've had, in Wisconsin or otherwise; the meat was fantastic, and for me, that more or less defines the quality of a gyro. The fries were decent and the baklava was wonderful, but the meat on the gyro alone will get me back here (probably frequently, despite the drive from Middleton).  The service was also really great. We explained that we hadn't been to Parthenon before and the cashier walked us through their gyros and recommended a few things. Extremely pleased overall, and (now) definitely one of my favorite spots in town."}
{"text":"This is a fast food joint with the prices of a full service restaurant.  The food (gyro meal) is ok but not great, the atmosphere is ok, the prices are outrageous ($10 for lunch gyro sandwich, fries and soda). If you are desperate for a gyro and no other options then this place is fine."}
{"text":"The Best Gyros in the US, and believe me I've tried to find something to equal theirs. Been frequenting this establishment since the mid 1970's, and when my travels take me back to Madison this is always on my list for lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for dinner. It was fast and decent but didn't seem to be worth the price in my opinion. (kindof \"fast-foodish\", a bit smaller portions, and a bit less flavorful than expected.)   Not bad or disappointing by any means - just not my cup of tea.  Would have rather spent my $12 at HopCat, Ian's, the SideDoor, Sushi Express, etc."}
{"text":"I stopped in here on July 27th and was pleasantly surprised. The place was clean and the service staff professional. I had their mega gyro, which was easily twice the size of a normal gyro. It was quite good! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others and visit often if I lived near Madison."}
{"text":"Late night munchies! Gotta try their fries here, so crispy and good. Beers are super cheap, and there's plenty of room to sit!"}
{"text":"I honestly can't comprehend the hate this place gets from some folks. Maybe it's because Parthenon served the first gyro I ever tried, but this place remains my favorite years later.   I will admit, this place has been a bit of a crapshoot at times. There's been a lot of inconsistency in the speed of service, the portion sizes, the \"freshness\" of the ingredients, and cleanliness. I've determined that the best time to hit up Parthenon is when it's busy--they're best when they're shaving the meat directly off the spit and putting it right into your gyro.  On that note, I'll also admit that I've only ever tried their gyro. I've had friends try their souvlaki and I always mean to try something else, but I always end up just ordering the gyro because I know it's good.  The sauce is always tangy and garlic-ey, and there's just enough of it to make a mess. The meat is always delicious and a bit salty. I don't know what it is about other gyro places, but the meat is always where they seem to drop the ball. The texture and flavor of Parthenon's meat succeeds where other gyro places fail.  The décor isn't anything fancy, but since the remodel it seems pretty nice. (This place used to look like a dump, not so much anymore.) The roof garden upstairs provides a nice enough view of State Street and the State Capitol.  Being open late, this place can bring the drunks in. If you're not a fan of that scene I would avoid the Parthenon at night. If you are, the gyros are even better when you're drunk."}
{"text":"The gyros I have eaten on many a drunken night here really remind me of the gyros I have eaten on many a drunken night in Chicago. And so does the seedy, butt-ugly atmosphere of this place. But if eating some of the best gyros ever in Chicago has taught me one thing, it's not to judge a gyro place by its cover. Parthenon Gyros is no dirtier than the kitchen located right next to the counter, in true big-city style.   The fries are usually cooked and seasoned very well, and they don't do a bad job with things like the spanakopita either. I love the tzatziki sauce; you get a good 50/50 mix of yogurt and mint in the aftertaste. Like every other topping, including the gyro meat, it is generously piled on top of the bread (another one of their most outstanding ingredients).  Parthenon is very fast-foody, but I don't know a good gyro place that isn't. So if you want to escape the dining room that looks like a bathroom, go to the rooftop tables. You can watch State Street go by while you eat one of the best gyros in Madison.  Oh, and they serve beer."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place in a few years, but I went there earlier today and man has it gone downhill. the portions were dinky, the meat was dry and tough, they screwed up my order after I had repeated it twice, and the staff was more interested in talking with each other than proving any halfway decent service. The next time I have a gyro craving i'll be taking my money elsewhere"}
{"text":"Still the best gyros I have eaten in the United States and I have tried many places. Maybe I am biased since it is in my home town.    We came in the day before Thanksgiving and it was late. WE had to wait for a while for them to bring out a new chunk of meat but it was worth the wait. Parthenon has been here for 45 years and food is still good and people are nice.   Come on in for a taste of gyro you won't forget. While you are here, try the fries and walk State Street."}
{"text":"First of all, screw the entrees, the fries are TO DIE FOR. For crispy fries, can't think of a better place on State Street.  Best enjoyed while hammered... the Greek music videos are an interesting touch.  I heard stories about how, years ago, in place of Pizza di Roma, another gyros shop competed with Parthenon, and they used to sharpen their knives in the windows, either threatening each other or trying to draw more customers. Sadly not the case anymore, would be much more entertaining if so.  For a student, within reason but a *bit* pricy, especially if one already spent money out."}
{"text":"I'm basing this review solely on the gyro itself. I may be a bad person to ask, and a little biased, but I think Parthenon had one of the worst gyros I've had in the Madison area.   I really like the ambience and decor of Parthenon, but the food is lackluster. I grew up in a Greek household, surrounded by a larger Greek community, and from those experiences, I feel like the lamb meat leaves a lot left to be desired.   The pitas they use are pretty dry, and the tzatziki sauce doesn't have the flavor I'm used to.   I realize that I'm being completely pretentious in this review, but I walked away from my Parthenon experience less than impressed."}
{"text":"Stopped by with college friends visiting Madison who insisted on stopping here as a tribute to the 'good old days.'  Already not a huge fan I went along with it, not expecting anything too great.  I was right.  Rude staff, dungeon-like seating areas with horrible lighting and cheesy commercials about Greece playing.  DIRTY floors and tables.  The group consensus after getting our food?  \"What the hell were we thinking?!? Either we had no taste in our college days, or the Parthenon has gone seriously down hill.\"  Overly salty meat, dry and stale pitas, with mushy onions and tomatoes.  Gross."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! I normally don't enjoy eating gyros but something about this place makes it special. The atmosphere is amazing and the employees are all very friendly!! They're open late which is amazing. I highly recommend eating here!!"}
{"text":"I actually Googled if that is a word this place . I'm not from Madison but I wanted something different than the usual hamburger I  get so I moved on to look for gyro.  I was a little worried because the stars was low but I'm glad I took a chance . Upon entry I could just smell the food . There was a very broad chest healthy looking middle eastern man cooking which made me feel confident about my meal if he look like that maybe it's healthy food lol . So he greeted me as I walked in to a very clean environment which I appreciate so I was pleased so far    After greet I met the staff who I'd like to call the dynamic duo one girl I asked there names and one guy . Nicole and justen are truly amazing they both helped me pic a meal that was to my liking . I was going to spend less money but they immediately up sold me to a much more expensive option that would best suit my appetite . The food was amazing ! Fresh fries out of clean grease meat cooked but not over done sliced right off the spindle beverage fresh and clearly the syrup and carbon was mixed well and even though my toppings was cold it did not affect the temperature of my meat   I sat an dined in because I was going to take out . The service was so amazing I called my co worker over so he could enjoy . The thing I loved most about this place was not the food but the service it actually made the food better if you ask us . The guy in charge was not rude and not rushing me to hurry and order which I appreciate since I am spending money . They turned my ten dollar order into two 13 dollar orders so staff is on point . Very attractive and we'll groomed staff it's like they truly care about their restaurant.  I suggest you try this place it will not disappoint thanks justen and nicole I will spread the word about this place"}
{"text":"Great service & amazing food! The outdoor seating area on the roof is the perfect outdoor dining experience!"}
{"text":"I came in for a gyro meal. It was a tad pricey: $9.75 for a gyro, fries and pop. But hey, the value's pretty good. It was served to me quite quickly, nice and hot. The gyro was sizeable and delicious, and the fries were crispy. The atmosphere is nothing special; your typical Greek fast food joint. I would eat here again, if my wallet were up for it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is LEGENDARY! My husband went to UW and he probably ate here 5/7 days a week while he was in school! We still try to stop by whenever we're downtown to enjoy some of the best gyros in the world! The food is absolutely delicious!!!"}
{"text":"When I crave gyros, Parthenon Gyros is my homeboy.   This place is affordable and fast and also has plenty of seating. I almost always go here for gyros, which is large and satisfying. I've also had the Hercules plate (which is a Greek meat fest) and the spinach pie, which is pretty good as well.   My only complaint is that they seriously need to change the channels on the TVs. They only show documentaries of Greece."}
{"text":"Gyros and fries are wonderful, non-Taco Bell / Pizza alternative to fatty, but tasty guilty pleasures. Parthenon engages customers with solid service and better than average customary dishes for fast Greek. Check out when you wish not to count calories."}
{"text":"The gyro was very good, the fries were great, but the folks behind the counter were just the cheeriest folks I've met in weeks. They went above and beyond to make sure I was being taken care of, and I appreciate that! 5-star food, 5-star staff, I'd recommend Parthenon in a second."}
{"text":"I don't know whether it's because I was too hungry or just because the gyro is too damn good that I wanted a second one...or maybe a third one ?"}
{"text":"Gyros weren't bad. The detracting factors however were the impatient workers, dirty dining area, and bathrooms in pretty bad shape. We went with the kids and they enjoyed the Gyros. Over flowing trash bins in the dining area at lunch time and a line out the door. Food is tasty and fast so I would not be opposed to coming back for takeout."}
{"text":"Gyros was good! Not the best I have had but good- portions are huge- get the regular size- no need for the jumbo."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner, tried the chicken, pork kabob and gyro - all were good but the gyro stood out as the tastiest and nice tzatzik. Fries were legit. Super fresh and authentic tasting. Great staff and service, friendly and accommodating. Plus beer."}
{"text":"I think I contracted a disease by simply walking in here; no amount of alcohol could cover how dirty this place is or make me want to try the food."}
{"text":"This is the place for gyros in Madison!  Right on state street, and up top they have outdoor seating.  One of the fantastic places for a late night meal on a beautiful summer Madison evening."}
{"text":"My go-to late night place.  When I first was taken here by the boyfriend (a Madison native), I was very hesitant. The inside is nothing special and reminds me of a hospital. You order at the counter and then go sit down. Their service is FAST.   I come here regularly now. Great for lunch, dinner, and late night. They do not deliver (the only con), but it is worth coming to. I have never sat on the upstairs patio, but we often sit on the State Street patio in the summertime.   These gyros are amazing. Soft, messy, and the sauce is unbelievable. I always can finish mine, even if I am totally full. These gyros are melt-in-your-mouth good. When coming home from the bars we usually get an order of cheese fries, which are gooey and hot and delicious. The nacho cheese is plentiful. I would recommend them.  I am originally from the Milwaukee area, and everyone there knows OG. These are better than OG. Seriously."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved this place! Workers were super friendly, food was extremely fresh and the fries were ugh-mazing. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"After a late night of bar hopping around Madison I was happy to find a place open late walking back to my room. The Parthenon was exactly what I needed. A large warm pita stuffed with a hearty selection of gyro meat, onions and cool cucumber sauce with a basket of fries, good price and a friendly guy to chat up that was working there. A 2am savior!"}
{"text":"Yum! Love the greek salads and the rooftop patio.  As mentioned, they are open late, which is convenient when you aren't in the mood for a burrito or pizza.  Supposedly a friend of a friend of a friend found a chunk of metal in their Euro, but that has the makings of an urban legend, so who knows?  This place has been a favorite for fast food since high school.  4 stars."}
{"text":"Been a while since I've had a Gyro, and glad I stopped in!  Place was referred to me by a friend, whom said this is a can't miss joint.  Very clean, service is excellent!!!  Had the Gyro meal for $11.00 - they don't skimp on the meat or the fries...the fries, double cooked with a batter I believe, very CRISPY, very HOT!!!  Great spot, great part of town - forget frozen burgers and hour old fries - have a Gyro!"}
{"text":"We had our order to go.  Service was fast and food was hot.   The gyros were stuffed full of meat.  The topper was the FRESH tomatoes.  Not used at other gyro places in town.  Make this a stop on your next trip to State St."}
{"text":"Small menu: gyros and french fries- but if you're in the mood for an awesome gyro, bursting with meat and dripping with juice, and thick delicious french fries, then this is the place to go for lunch, dinner, or late night food.   atmosphere is like a fast food restaurant, as is the service, but that just means you get to eat your food faster and it doesn't matter if there is a line out the door after bartime."}
{"text":"Fantastic flavorful gyros served with so much warmth at the counter. I've been coming here since elementary school and make sure to visit every time I am in town. So fun watching them shave the meat from the enormous hunk of meat turning on a vertical spit. I'd love to know how that is made - the lamb is seasoned just perfectly. Very nice staff / owners. Thank you!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I went there, but I give it five stars: I met Emo Phillips there, and they always let me use their bathroom. Plus the gyros are delicious and the fries are the best late night fries I've ever had."}
{"text":"Good food. Too much salt on the fries. Service kind of slow, but not terrible. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"went to have gyro as I have never had it before. It is okay I would say. But expected a little more. Customer service is also not the best. Overall I don't think I would go there anytime in future. Also I think it is a bit pricey for the food I get."}
{"text":"Big portions if you order the gyros plates, but the sandwiches are small. Most days the meat tastes steamed or microwaved, not roasted. Mediocre to sub mediocre, and with so many State street options this is a definite pass. Everything here is significantly overpriced; $10-per-person average is much better spent elsewhere. One of my least favorite food spots in Madison."}
{"text":"I'm from out of state and I've had gyros where I'm from, but my boyfriend decided to take me to this spot 'cause he says it was one of the best,  Unfortunately, we didn't experience that the night we came in.  The place was empty when we walked in on a Thursday night and we ordered two gyros and large fries to go. They grabbed the meat from a pan that had been sitting there for who knows how long and we got the last batch of fries (the worker put a new batch for a customer that came after us).  Needless to say, when we got home (which is only 5 min away), the gyros were room temperature and the fries were stale.   One star for tender meat and the toppings were yummy. Another star for the burnt fries I found within the stale ones....and I happen to love the burnt ones. Ha!"}
{"text":"The fries were out of this world delicious. The Gyro was covered in that sauce but it was way delicious regardless. Really good drinking food I think! We stopped here on our way wandering state street and it was really worth it."}
{"text":"The Gyro's are pretty good here, but the one thing that I really love are the french fries!  Those fries taste like the type of fries that you have at one of those BBQ places.  They are nice and thick and have that crispy texture to them that really makes you want to ask for a side of Ranch dressing, but I wasn't daring enough to ask for ranch dressing at a Greek restaurant."}
{"text":"Food tasted awful. The food wasn't hot and tasted bland. The customer service people were rude. I would not recommend this place ever!!"}
{"text":"Honestly can't agree more with some of the reviews on here. However on the other hand if you've tried their gyros before you can tell there are skimping on both the meat and the sauce. Rather skimp on the meat than anything else."}
{"text":"Excellent food best gyro in town! The gyro platter is fantastic as well. The guy that takes the order is a so rude.  He makes me think twice about sating there. The restaurant itself is dirty and the seating really needs to be updated."}
{"text":"When I was in school at UW, we LOVED Parthenon gyros, going occasionally for lunch. The meat was always hot, juicy, and seemed fresh.  Their fries always seemed hot and fresh as well.    We went there last night for dinner after a long hiatus.  The service was very quick and we loved the outdoor seating area.  The fries seemed different than I remembered, but still very good.  The gyros had the same ingredients I remember, but the meat was not very hot or juicy, and seemed thinner than I remember.  Of course maybe my memory sucks :)  Just overall not as good as when I was in college.  I would still go back and try again though, as maybe it was just a fluke."}
{"text":"The best of Madison for a good reason! Delish. Fast, good and worth it. Definitely. None better. Recommended."}
{"text":"As the night was winding down on State Street, we started looking for some food options. Since we had already given Ian's a whirl the night before, we thought we'd look for something else. The long line outside of Parthenon Gyros was an immediate recommendation, and late night gyros, kefta, and kebabs are a treasured institution the world over.  After waiting almost an hour, we entered what struck me, as I see it did other reviewers, as basically a Greek McDonald's. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing - hey, I'm all for a speedy late night gyro. And with the lamb and beef glistening on the spit, my Greek pants were getting excited. But in sum total, the experience was a let down. The gyro meat wasn't tossed on a griddle or anything before being served, so it didn't get that crispy char at the edges. The tomatoes and onions in the pita were freezing cold, which translated into nearly cold gyro meat along with the cold tzatziki, which combined into a rather off-putting meal. The plate was served up quick once we got to the counter, but in this case, haste made waste.  The only redeeming factor is that the fries were actually quite good. Crispy and flavorful, and if you get a piping hot batch, they are delicious with a side of feta cheese dumped and slightly melted on top, which you can purchase for about 75 cents.  I was so hoping this late night gyro would be fantastic. But alas, we should have just gone back to Ian's."}
{"text":"This is where you go when you are drunk.  That is it.  You forget that your meal should taste better and be better priced.  The gyro meat is good but the prices are astronomical for a gyro.  The fries are crinkle cut right out of the bag.  They are completely tasteless.    In addition, the sauce is really tart.  Tzatziki sauce should have a creamy taste to compliment the gyro.  The sauce is so pungent that it ruins the flavor of the gyro.    The people are nice, the service is quick and the outdoor patio is gorgeous.  Otherwise, skip it."}
{"text":"Good gyros, but it is a gyro...Not really all that hard to do well and I have definitely had better. Having Greek MTV on is definitely a nice touch though. But I gotta say I never liked the attitude of the guys working there. Maybe they were just hardened from years of dealing with drunk fratboys at 3 in the morning and the State St. bums all day."}
{"text":"I love a good American style gyro and this place is on point. Quick service, lots of seating, and tasty. Not trying to be anything it is not. Great pricing makes this a slam dunk."}
{"text":"Parthenon is great and definitely the best Gyros in Madison. You're gonna pay about $10 for a gyro with fries and a soda. My family and I came here a lot in college and would order a basket of fries (or two depending on how hungry we are) to share between the four of us. They also put a lot of onions on the gyro so be prepared to pick some off or ask for one without onions. Even my mom, who loves onions, has to take some off sometimes."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!!!!  WYSSTIWYG!!!!!   Awesome!!!  Even the FFs are great!  Goin' back soon!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic gyro or need to fulfill your gyro craving, this is the place to go.  There was so much piled on the warm pita bread, it was nearly impossible to hold.  Freshly cut from the spit, the lamb meat was piled on and on and on.  There tzatziki had fantastic flavor and, again, they did not skimp.  They also made perfect French fries:  crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  My wife, preferring to keeping her meal a bit more on the healthy side, thoroughly enjoyed her hearty Greek salad with tzatziki sauce.  It was made even better when I shared my lamb meat.  The service was fast and friendly.  They bustled to complete our order.  Simply outstanding."}
{"text":"The food is definitely better than the service.  Fries are the best, gyros come with a healthy topping of onions and tomatoes.  Its good if you want greek quick and dirty."}
{"text":"I eat here whenever I'm in Madtown, and it rocks my world every time.  It's true that the decor makes it look like a weird Greek fast food joint, and there are always groups of rowdy UW kids scarfing some spanakopitas, but this place is a Madison institution for a reason.  The gyros are awesome and the fries are great - especially when dipped in the tzatziki sauce.  Don't be a snob about it, just have a few spotted cows and dig in."}
{"text":"Great food!   Cheesy decor.  But lots of tables to choose from.  Fast service.  But not so friendly employees.  Just let the gyros take you awayyyyyyyyy!"}
{"text":"Very important restaurant for students, inexpensive tasty food until 3am. I had gyros, meat was cooked well and the tzatziki sauce was scrumptious. Service is at the counter, quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Just had the worst gyro of my life.  This place used to be really good.  Today's gyro was a real disappointment.  Don't think I will be back,"}
{"text":"I've eaten good gyros, so-so gyros, bad gyros and this trash.  Meat is burnt and salty. I doubt is actual meat. Onions smell too much and its impossible to eat the thing with your hands because of the size of the serving basket."}
{"text":"One night I was hungry, and I looked up at the clock in my room. Oh no! It's past midnight! I forgot that it's Madison and that most restaurants are closed by now. Quickly getting onto my favorite app, I find out that there are still a few places open. Parthenon Gyros is one such place, and I enjoy gyros as well.   I've been here quite a bit now, but every time I get their extra-stuffed gyro, sometimes with fries and a drink. The gyro comes with onions, tomatoes, and a good tzaziki sauce that I always get a little extra of. This is mostly because their menu isn't huge. I enjoy this order, a big, sloppy, greasy, flavorful tummy of meat when I'm not feeling fancy. It's not the absolute best gyro meat I've ever had, but it's good enough for 1AM food.   PS - parking on State Street is usually a pain/expensive, but when it's this late, parking is plentiful. I found this fact extremely convenient when I want to pop into my car to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"Long time patron, first time Yelper.  This is the best gyros in Madison. Our daughter says it's better than any gyros in the Pacific Northwest. The Parthenon is a Madison culinary icon. Savory meat, sweet onions, tomatoes, and yogurt sauce on grilled pita bread, who's the genius who thought of this? Anyway, the staff are awesome, the joint is bright and clean. The Greek music videos throughout the restaurant.  It's all wonderful. Oh, and the fries and souvlaki are excellent too."}
{"text":"The food and service was fine. Very quick even. But man the food was overwhelmingly mediocre. Fries were actually delicious but their gyros were just not good. Good for drunk and hungry. Not good for quality gyro meat."}
{"text":"This is basically a fast-food place to get your Gyros. But they are delicious and huge and the fries are great too. They have indoor and outdoor seating. It is not the most modern, up-to-date establishment but the food is good. When the weather is nice we enjoy taking our food and eating upstairs in their out door seating area."}
{"text":"perfect late night after-bar food. I crave it fortnightly!   Smokin hot gyro == $7  Onion breath == free."}
{"text":"The mega gyro was fantastic and the fries were awesome! The staff were really nice and really helpful.  They also have a variety of local beers.  I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Messy and delicious.. slightly pricey, but well worth it.   Fantastic Gyros.. Pork souvlaki, which is new to me.. i'm certainly used to the standard beef/chicken lineup. But the Pork was tasty and well cooked.. They at times go a little heavy on the onions, but if that's not your thing, pick them off and go for it."}
{"text":"Quick food.  Not surprisingly it tastes like a chain"}
{"text":"I might not be the best critic for ALL of Parthenon's offerings, however, I am a HUGE fan of their Gyros.  Man, this things are melt in your mouth delicious.  I was on a Wisconsin tour with my girlfriend who's never been to Wisconsin and Parthenon's was one of the MUSTS on our to-do list.  I live in Colorado now and every time we come back we're sure to come visit and pick up a Gyro-Fry-Pepsi.  Thanks guys, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Parthenon is the ONLY gyro place in Madison, as far as I'm concerned. It has been around for a lonnng time, easily since I was in middle school.   They made an awesome gyro meal and although the price as gone up over the years, it's worth your cash."}
{"text":"The best gyro I've had anywhere and it's not even close.  We've been coming to Madison a few times a year since I was a kid, and we rarely miss a chance to come here.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"It's a gyro joint, they do that well enough  Getting double meat is somewhat unwieldy so I don't recommend that"}
{"text":"Great Food and Prices. Fries are great as well as their Gyros. Everything is homemade which is hard to find when you're surrounded by gas station mystery meat. High recommend!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this place when I was strolling around state street cause I was really itching to have a gyro.  The gyro was good, not bad, but not amazing either.   I was a little surprised by the price, 7 dollars for just the gyro, and then 10 for a meal which seemed just a tad pricey for me.   Pros: Super fast, convenient location, pretty tasty gyro, plenty of seating.  Cons: A little pricey."}
{"text":"The food is alright. The gyros were honestly pretty disappointing-- I had heard that they were the best in Madison, and I hope that they aren't. The atmosphere is pretty dumpy as well... Overall, nothing I'm very excited to try again. I wish I could recommend a better gyro place!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I have never experienced such good house made gyros in the states like this place. The atmosphere is awesome too, and the hours are perfect. Great staff everyone is super friendly! Would recommend this to anyone in this area!! Excellent."}
{"text":"I really love their gyros. They really are the best I have had in Madison. I think $10 for a sandwich is expensive, but they really can't be beat. You do get a very generous portion of food for your $.   I found the people behind the counter to be a bit rude and rushed (they weren't that busy), but because they are the best gyros in town I will keep going back.   They have outdoor dining on the roof which I think is great for a nice day. The indoor dining is just ok. They have really loud Greek music playing in the background."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not overly impressive. Though, it is a gyro joint. The food wasn't bad. I liked the gyros better than the fries my friend and I shared. They seemed overly greasy and limp. Maybe they'd been sitting under the heat lamp too long. At least the gyro meat looked fresher and more edible. While I agree they are a tad over-priced for the quality, they at least make up for it in quantity. Plus, if you look at the menu and think about it, you can work it so you can feed multiple people for less than if everyone each got their own gyros and fries. If I lived near the State Street area, I'd probably pop in at least a few times a month for a quick bite for lunch or late night because I don't eat enough meat carved off a spit."}
{"text":"I usually come here around lunch time and I find the staff to be very friendly and helpful.  They always ask how the food is, and say goodbye as people leave.  I typically get the gyro meal, and it has never disappointed.  You get plenty of meat with the gyro, the french fries are nice and crispy.  Overall, I think its well worth the price.  The atmosphere is also kind of fun, they play Greek music videos."}
{"text":"Excellent gyros and the tastiest fries I've had in a long time.  I have never had a gyro before I came here.  I'm 32....The smell once you step inside is amazing.  For $10, you get a giant gyro, fries and a soda.  This is a pretty good deal.  I can't give it 4.5 stars, but I would because a better price would be $8 for everything above.  That being said, it is excellent food for $10.  The french fries are the most amazing that I've had in about a year.  They are delicious and very crispy, just the way they should be."}
{"text":"Love these Gyros! Save yourself and don't get the fries- you will not be able to eat them after the huge sandwich. If there are two of you, get one fry to share!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to what used to be THE best gyro joint in town, but I'll never go back.  Staff is RUDE AND SNARKY, and the meat cone is never full of meat.  The meat I was given was PINK and sitting in some watery liquid, the tomatoes were rotten and they forgot to put the tzatziki-sauce on so when I got back to my apartment I had a soggy pink no sauce gyro and had been insulted by the rudeness of the staff.... No wonder when you walk by on a weekend evening and the place is dead.  Get it together or you'll be another coffee shop by next year."}
{"text":"Hercules platter was delicious Vera lamb gyro age better season than the other spot that I have visited in the area and less greasy. The chicken and pork tasted ordinary  and yogurt was quite tasty."}
{"text":"Great food! The meat was some of the best I've had, very well seasoned. The sauce was a little thinner than I'd prefer, but still very tasty. Establishment was very clean and friendly. The gentleman taking the orders was very polite and explained the options, as well as, recommended to customers who declined the sauce to try it on the side. Definitely would eat here again and recommend to anyone visiting Madison!"}
{"text":"Normally great Gyros. It might have been the fact we ate there early in the day. Gluten free only is with no Pita. Fries are breaded."}
{"text":"Its open late and always hits the spot.  Fries in a paper bag and gyron to go with lots of white sauce on the side.  I've eaten here when not totally drunk and the food is good.  The greek salad and gyros are always a safe bet."}
{"text":"Oh Parthenon, how I miss thee.... I moved from the Madison area quite some time ago now, but the Parthenon was one of the best spots in Madison. My cholesterol levels are much better for having had to give it up, but I often remember the grease soaked fries with much fondness. The quality and spice of the gyro meat was unbeatable in Madtown. The pita was nice and sturdy yet delicious, so it could actually take some abuse yet still be tasty.  And, of course, what with it being in Madison, it is one of the best places to go when you've had way too much to drink. ;)"}
{"text":"Seriously good gyros for super cheap and the fries are also excellent.  This was one of the better post-drinking meals I've had in a long time.  It's also pretty sweet that they sell beer here as well."}
{"text":"Parthenon sets the bar for the gyro experience.  They are the \"Mona Lisa\" of Madison gyros.  They are the ones that all other gyros will be measured against - and likely fall short of.  The standard gyro/fry/soda order is more than enough for a meal.  The meat is plentiful as are the toppings.  The fries are done well and are handy for mopping up what's left behind form the gyro itself.  Parthenon offers a delicious and consistent experience.    If you want more, you can get the gyro plate, but you'll want to tack on an extra pita or two.  Go to the rooftop on a nice day to enjoy your meal or park yourself somewhere along the street to people-watch while you dine (Springtime is a great time downtown...)  For those of us on the perifery, it's not hella-convenient to head downtown for lunch.  But, if you can get yourself down there, it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Mega Gyro last night- I did share with my friend, a little. It was delicious. The lamb was tender and fresh, there were not too many onions, and there were Greek music videos playing while we ate. The counter guy was friendly and tried to sell me some baklava when I was eyeing it at the register. That was so cute, and I am sure it is great baklava! That gyro was huge, though. Uurrp. I love gyro belches, don't you? :D So, I will have to stop back in and get some baklava another night. Thanks, y'all, for a tasty and affordable late-night gyro."}
{"text":"In town for the 'Modest Mouse' show with some buddies.  The Parthenon IS the gold standard when it comes to gyros.  Best gyros I've had anywhere, anytime.  This visit was no different than previous visits.    The meat has the perfect flavor, lots of great spices and great crispy bits.  Nice pita and fresh tomatoes.  I prefer no onions and like the sauce on the side.  Paired wth a Capital Amber.  I kinda wish I would have had the fries.  Super crispy and salty, I snuck some from one friend.  The plan is to stop after the show for round 2.  ...and yep Round #2!  Quote of the night from one of the friends that had never been to Parthenon... \"I became a Parthenon rookie and veteran all in the same day!\""}
{"text":"Ick.  Have you people ever tasted a gyro before?  This one was so salty I could barely get it down.  I find it interesting that the reviews are so split on this place-I'm guessing that most of the four and five stars hit up this joint post drinking on State street.  I went in hoping for a quick and delicious Greek meal before I had to make my way to the airport but was sorely disappointed when I received my sandwich.  The pita was yummy, but it was filled with dry, overly salty meat of questionable origin, too many onions, and a pile of sauce.    If I lived in Wisconsin, you couldn't pay me to go back. In fact, if you paid for my travel to Wisconsin and for my lunch, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The Parthenon is a great gyro place that I wish we had in Western NY. Been coming here for decades everytime we are in Madison. The gyros are straight off the rotisserie not precut. Moist and plenty of onions though the quantity of meat has been reduced. The fries are crispy and delicious. Good at anytime day or night."}
{"text":"This place is open late, which is one of the best parts of the restaurant. The food is made to order right in front of you and the guys know what they're doing. If you love gyros and fries with yogurt sauce you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I always have to hit this place when on State St.  Great Gyros and fresh cut fries!! I love sitting on the rooftop."}
{"text":"So I've been going to The Parthenon for nearly 2 decades and it was always really great but the last couple times I've gone the meat tasted different...like not as good. I don't know if they've changed vendors or what but something is definitely not quite right. Previously I would have give the Parthenon 5 stars but now it's closer to 3.5/4 stars. I dont like potatoes but my husband loves the fries.  I have also tried the baklava, souvlaki and chicken kabobs. The baklava was delicious, the souvlaki was good and the kabobs were just ok.  There is outdoor seating in front and on the upper terrace with is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Delicious! These gyros are so good. The bread is just right... chewy, warm and tender. The perfectly seaoned gyro meat is accented so nicely with the rings of onions and tomato slices... and the tzaziki sauce on top..... perfect! I normally order the chicken-bob and that is amazing too. Really love sitting upstairs on the terrace when the weather is nice. So relaxing. Pretty view of the Capitol too."}
{"text":"I've been going here for 5+ years. It's a family tradition. It's great food at a reasonable price with good service. Not much more you could ask for."}
{"text":"It's a tragedy that the average is so low. This is hands down best gyro I've ever had. Wonderful friendly and fast service. I'll definitely be back again. Many, many, more times."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"mega\" (for ~$9), because I wanted a lot of gyros meat.  I love gyros meat (well, actually, I love kebab meat,and am spoiled by the time I spend each year in Hamburg, where the best places have slabs of meat hunks rotating on a spit, not just burnt minced composite product, like Parthenon has).  At Parthenon, I just picked at the gyros meat and a bunch of the onion, and left the bloated pita and the tomato.   The meat was black, scrawny, and there was precious little of it.   If this was the \"mega\" I would hate to see the normal gyros, and if I ever do order it, I will bring a microscope.  As a form of therapy,  a couple days later I went to Oakland Gyros on Layton in Milwaukee. For ~$6 (!)  their gyros has mountains of succulent, rich, tasty slabs of gyros - - dense, rich rolls of it - - piled so high it is had to finish (along with plenty onion and a really good tsatsiki in squeeze bottles).   The contrast is so massive, and the Parthenon gyros is so miserable and pathetic in contrast (in terms of quantity, quality, and flavor), that rating Parthenon with two stars should nominate me for sainthood, in the Parthenon pantheon.  But I just can't give it two stars.  This is a major rip-off, and a horrible product."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stumble into after bar time for some greasy grub. Of course, it's not the greatest Greek ethnic restaurant I've ever been to... so far, nothing compares to any restaurant in the \"Greek Town\" area of Detroit. But I digress.  The Parthenon isn't trying to compete on that level, so it's not fair to hold them to that standard. This is a greasy spoon that caters to drunk college students... and it does that well. Very well.  Order yourself a gyro, and make sure to get an order of fries... If not for yourself, at least to share. They are amazing."}
{"text":"Wow!  Best gyros I have ever had, I think.  The fries were also awesome..perfectly crispy, and freshly made.  Employees very friendly.  Prices were decent.  I would definitely go back, and would recommend it.  Everything was perfect about our meal!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place in a college town over the summer is that it's open when it's late.   I ordered the Chicken Caesar Sandwich meal. I wasn't very impressed with it. The chicken came on two skewers and was overdone and dry. The romaine lettuce sat on the pita and it was over saturated with Caesar dressing and parmesan cheese. The fries that came with it were not very fresh - some were crispy, many were mushy.   Price-wise, I don't think it's fair to charge another $2-3 on top of the sandwich for a negligible amount of fries and a fountain drink. The sandwich by itself would have been $8, which is a lot considering the ingredients."}
{"text":"Seriously this place has the best gyro in town. I have tried many Greek restaurants and they may not have a complex flavor but the ingredients are fresh and the flavor is spot on. It's very simple and simple is delicious."}
{"text":"Freaking amazing greasy gyros.    I headed in here with my Mom and my Aunt.  My Mom's been going there for years (maybe even since she was going to UW in the 60s?) and it's the place to hit for a drippy, messy gyro."}
{"text":"Very nice place looks small but it has lots of space. Food very good and freshly made. Customer service was a plus!"}
{"text":"The undisputed champion Gyro of the world.  Gyro cones made on site Wednesday evenings with the best spices and meats around."}
{"text":"Parthenon Gyros is the best place to get gyros in Madison, hands down.   The restaurant itself is quite large, sitting between State Street and N Henry. There is usually parking to be found on the Henry side, though you have to enter at the State Street side. The interior is nothing special, but that's not what you go to Parthenon's for. You go for the food, and the food never disappoints. (However, when the weather is nice, the rooftop seating area is pretty darn awesome!)  Obviously the gyros are the best item on the menu. That's their jam. It's what they do. And they do it perfectly. But, don't get me wrong, everything else they do is great, too. The french fries are always perfectly battered and crisp and salty - so good. The baklava is pretty tasty as well. I have never had anything that I wasn't happy with.   And, can we talk about service while we're at it? The gentlemen I have seen behind the counter are always, ALWAYS in a good mood, friendly, upbeat, and most importantly, efficient. Parthenon's has peak hours where the line will be to the door, or even out the door. Don't let it fool you though. It always moves quickly!"}
{"text":"One of the greatest misfortunes to fall on those visiting Madison is visiting Parthenon hoping to find a gyro with heaping lamb accompanied by tangy cucumber sauce. Instead of that delicious treat, tourists will find outrageously high prices accompanied by lackluster imitation Greek food. A side of cheese dip for fries will cost 1.25 and it will lead the customer to ask themselves, \" Is this melted plastic?\" The setting and decor feels like a Greek McDonald's leaving you to sulk about the rip off you have just endured in truly desolate surroundings. Please treat yourself to the Gyro House out on E Washington for the best Gyro's in town, no one deserves this faux ethnic experience."}
