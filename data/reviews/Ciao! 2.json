{"text":"I walked in to check it out and this old hag at the bar started laughing because we didn't have reservations. He continued to be very disrespectful so my group of seven and I left. Very unprofessional!"}
{"text":"Please take the general advice of most reviewers and do not eat here. Ciao! Should be called chow, as in dog chow. This is the worst food I have ever had.  The veal was terrible and the pasta trio was not good either, sorry to be so crass but the food was really bad. Service, atmosphere etc doesn't really matter if the food is this bad."}
{"text":"Used to really enjoy this place.  Unfortunately EVERY item on the menu now includes tomatoes and they aren't very good at catering to food allergies.  

Still... a fantastic place to have a glass of wine.  Perfect for a first date or a girls night."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food!! Ciao 2 served lunch for my family (over thirty people) after my Grandmother's funeral on Saturday. We were served family style the most amazing appetizer, salad, chicken parm, pasta and tiramisu. Service was the perfect speed - every request was honored with a smile and we never felt rushed. I cannot say enough good things about the ciao 2 family - they made a very difficult experience into a family celebration. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend.  Flat bread was okay.  Lasagna was way over cooked and smothered in a flavorless sauce.  Stuffed banana peppers also way over cooked and smothered in the same flavorless sauce.  Field green salad was three pieces of romaine torn in half.  Even the bread was mediocre. Very displeased with food, and the owners excuse for the paste like lasagna.  With so many fine Italian establishment's in Pittsburgh, try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Overpriced.  I had the $24 chicken Marsala and it was awful.  It was a thin piece of breaded chicken that looked like it had been deep fried.  The sauce had zero Marsala flavor; the only flavor it did have was salt.  Would not go back."}
{"text":"I met some friends here for a friend's birthday dinner. I saw calamari and gnocchi on the menu and was excited to try it. It was a huge mistake the calamari was overcooked to the point that it was chewy and rubbery. The gnocchi was awful. It wasn't the soft gnocchi that I am so fond of!  Their version was hard and the red sauce they are famous for was tasteless. Who messes up gnocchi!! If you're looking for great italian food go anywhere but here!"}
{"text":"I had always enjoyed the food but will never return due to poor management and staff.  I ordered a gift certificate online to be sent directly to the recipient and it was never sent.  I had to send countless emails which all by one of them  was ignored to address the issue.  The one response I did get back stated I would receive a phone call that next Monday to resolve.  No call.  I then called and spoke to a staff member about the issue was told I would get a call back and never did.  I finally called and asked to speak to the manager, who actually happened to answer the phone.  I explained the situation and he seemed to be aware.  He told me he would call me the next morning as soon as he opened the store and send out the gift certificate.  Do you think he did that?? No!! Making your customers chase you to even get a response let alone their money back is not a way to do business! I will NEVER step foot in there again as a result of poor management."}
{"text":"Don't waist your time or money Food was horrible and the chef was an asshole."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had an impromptu date night so we ended up in Robinson looking for dinner after going grocery shopping at the Giant Eagle.

We ended up there mostly because of the neon sign announcing that they are the home of the famous tomato basil sauce. Clever marketing - it got us through the door!

I ordered the Veal Marsala. This was just so disappointing. It was breaded quite a bit with not a lot of the \"Marsala wine reduction\" promised in the menu. Or perhaps the reduction was just so effective that it was non-existent. I tried to ask my server but she was just nowhere to be found. Considering that this is one of the more expensive items on the menu, it just didn't deliver. Veal was bland, over breaded, not sauced and pasta was just a bit mushy. And sadly, the tomato basil sauce was just so-so. Such a bummer since the neon sign announcing the sauce was what got us into this place for dinner! Note to self: never trust neon signs unless it just says \"OPEN.\"

I had a glass of wine with my entree - a Nebbiolo suggested by the manager (maybe owner, too?).  I didn't know that it would be just as much as my entree.  The wine went well with my entree, but it just ballooned my dinner check.

I think in order to get really good service, you must be a regular customer. Most of the tables there on the Saturday night we were there were known by our server. The other customers were so well known that she was engaged in so much catching up that it was tough getting our order in, drink refills, requesting our check, then once the check arrived getting her to get my credit card processed.

With food and service on our first visit scoring so poorly in my book, there's not much reason to go back. It also didn't help that it wasn't a cheap meal."}
{"text":"Probably a good place if you like greasy food. Pasta with chock full of creamy, heavy sauce disguised as Italian food is far from my favorite, but the firsy time I ended up here was for a small work party. Antupasti has poor quality ingredients, the cheese pieces tasted not fresh and the zuchhini fritters had more oil than any other ingredient. I got some kind of seafood dish, which was a piece of fish drenched in ol with a side of pasta. Thats all. The redeeming thing about this place is the warm bread. I did go back for a work lunch when the scallop appetizer was decent. The salad I got this time was okay at its best. Not worth the free parking at Settlers Ridge."}
{"text":"Very poor service and management. My group waited 3 hours before we decided to give up and go order a pizza. 30 minutes to place an order 30 more to get some bread on the table. 15 for the salads and another 10 for the dressing. 

Our waiter ignored us and we asked another for the manager to ask when we might recieve our food. The manager looked at our table, walked into the back, and didnt show himself for another 20 minutes. 2 hours after ordering it was still \"going to take some time\" so we decided to leave. 

There are only about 20 tables and we watched as others came in and got their food in under 2 hours. 

I DO NOT reccomend this place to anyone unless you really like sitting at a restaurant table waiting to be served and being apologized to by a poor excuse for a restaurant owner.


Edit: My uncle who is very serious about his food, went back the next day for lunch and had nothing but praise for his meal."}
{"text":"Over priced food for the money. Ordered a sandwich. Was asked if i wanted fries. 5 bucks for a handful of fries. Owner would not split check as well. Never again"}
{"text":"Menu is lack luster, the beverage list is twice the size of the dinner menu. As others have stated, the owner prefers \"regulars\" over others. He did not come to our table yop tell us the specials, or yo ask how our meals were, out even to say hello. 
I got the tortellini and it was gross. It was flavorless, and sitting in a swamp of oil. I had to shake each piece off before I ate it. the rolls were stale to say the least. I would not go back."}
{"text":"I recently visited Ciao!2 for dinner and was quite unimpressed.  From the moment we walked through the door service was rather slow and inattentive.  When our group ordered drinks I ordered a classic mixed cocktail namely a mint julep a drink that hasn't changed in over a century.  The waitress when I ordered the drink looked as if she had recently undergone a lobotomy, which is never a good sign.  What the waitress brought back to the table was essentially a bourbon mojito minus muddled mint with a sprig of mint as a garnish so large it looked like a pine tree sticking out of my glass.  I sent the drink back at which time the owner came over stating that he had personally made the drink himself and assured me that it was his version of a mint julep.  I am quite curious how you are able to muddle fresh mint leaves with out having any mint in the glass.  

After the drink debacle I decided I would try the four cheese pizza thinking to myself that the description sounded appetizing.  What arrived was the antithesis of what should be served at an Italian eatery.  The pizza had a certain similarity to that of a \"Freschetta Brick Oven\" pizza with a bottle of olive oil dumped on top.  The cheese was piled on so thick it was sickening.  I would highly suggest steering clear of the pizza.  

To set the setting a little the table we were sitting at was located approximately four to six feet from the bar area.  The bar had all of the stools, approximately 8-10, occupied with the owner/bartender sitting on the end.  During dinner our table was subjected to over hearing his snobbish and aristocratic diatribe over his world travels.  I don't care where you have been, I don't care how much it cost you, and I don't want to listen to this dribble while I try to choke down the slop served to me.

Now I will give the manager or what I suppose is the manager credit as he took the undesirable food and drink off of the check and offered desert to attempt to make up for the bad experience.  This was certainly a nice gesture however after we declined desert and simply requested the check he felt the need to pat me on the shoulder and ask again.  I don't know this man, have never spoken to this man, have never seen this man before now, and would rather not be touched by someone I have no idea who the heck it is.  If the manager happens to read this review I would like to suggest not touching customers.

Please, save your money and eat at a decent Italian eatery."}
{"text":"Food is good BUT the service is poor.  I was surprised because I had great expectations about it and purposely didn't read the reviews before my visit.  I shouldn't have to hunt the waiter down in order to pay my check so I can leave..  completely forgotten about ..  I never even received my wine with my meal after asking for it twice.  I think if you sat at the bar or were a regular you would receive better service no doubt.  I can think of several restaurants that have good food INCLUDING better service."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal Sunday night. Excellent tasty fare and nice atmosphere. Well run by an engaging family. Do stop in and give this new spot a good start."}
{"text":"As I always do whenever I go anywhere North East of Cincinnati I gotta find myself some Italian food. Because its always better. So I found this place.

Now I liked it. I went at lunch and I saw they had a veal cutlet sandwich and a chicken parm sandwich but no veal parm sandwich. However, the guy that worked there was nice enough to make me a veal parm sandwich anyway. So you gotta give them some love for that, right? Also they served the sandwich with zucchini fritters and marinara. I never had a sandwich with zucchini fritters as a side but guess what? It worked! I really liked it.

My only complaint is a style of veal. I really like veal cutlets when they are really thin and tender. Their veal was a little thick for my taste. Still good, but you don't get 5 stars with a thick veal"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite 'home-cooked' Italian restaurants . I love the family who owns the place, they all seem to work there and they are so sweet. The desserts are actually out of this world as is the rest of their food. They are a bit pricey but I pay more for the experience. I love the atmosphere and always enjoy myself when we make it out. They have an extensive knowledge on the wine they serve, their hand selected beer's and all of the food they make. If you make it there don't leave without trying the crab dip appetizer and arancini balls. Any of their soups or sandwiches that we've tried have not disappointed. The dinner's area always good but not my favorite for the money. You really can't go wrong when you eat here."}
{"text":"What Italian restaurant does not give you bread? The food was okay and the dinner portions were filling. A tad overpriced and my lasagna was floating in water and grease. We tried, nothing special probably won't be back again. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful and not over pushy! He was a pleasure to deal with."}
{"text":"Overpriced snobbish owner who is really impressed with himself. Food sucked to say the least. Avoid like the plague."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and the atmosphere is friendly. Went on a Friday night and even though it was busy we got seated and served quickly"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice, sometimes it can be hard to get a seat. It's small and loud.
Most of the food is really good home made food, some things can be just ok.
I had a seafood pasta once and a creamy pasta.
It depends on what you order.
The almond torte cake is good.

The waiters tend to be a little pushy. I'm sure in an italian home it's ok to be loud and pushy but not as a server. Even more insulting was when the waitress took the flower and some olive oil off my table while I was eating and gave it to another table like I wasn't even there??? 

The owner likes to talk a lot. If he is going to get that close to you he should at least use a breathe mint."}
{"text":"Before moving to Pittsburgh three years ago, I used to fly up for work.  I happened to go there one day for lunch and really enjoyed the food.  So, needless to say, I would make this place a regular stop every time I flew up here.  I even took other people who traveled with me.  They enjoyed it as well.  So much so, they would bring groups there for dinner after training. Always enjoyed talking to Nick the owner and enjoyed the food.

Why the 2 stars?  Well, when I was travelling, I signed up for their \"club\" and would receive coupons in the mail.  One night, after moving here, my wife and I decided to go there for dinner.  The service was slow, and when I went to use the \"Birthday Coupon\", Nick comes to our table, doesn't recognize me even after having eaten at his restaurant no less than 15-20 times, and then tells me that the coupon isn't for meals.  Nowhere on this coupon does it have any such disclaimer.

Then, my family came up for a visit and they want to go somewhere to eat.  It was about 4:30 on a Thursday and we go in and ask for a table.  Nick asks how many and I tell him eight.  He asked if I made reservations and I say, \"No.\"  He acts all put out and says, \"I don't know where I'm going to put you.\"  The restaurant was half empty!  Anyway, they set us outside where it was noisy and hot.  When we go to leave, there were more empty tables than people.  The service was okay, but not great.

For the $ there are better restaurants around.  I might go back again, but it will be a while."}
{"text":"My wife and I are always in search of  \"our little place\" but living in Robinson it can be hard to find something not part of a chain and with delicious food.  Then one day we stumbled upon Ciao 2.  A great atmosphere paired with hospitality and legitimate homemade italian food.  You know the type my mom would have made if i was italian.

Our first visit was over happy hour which had great specials on apps and cocktails.   the app of a breadstick came out and was a meal in and of itself. A giant homemade loaf with pepperoni and delicious side of their marinara.

Dinner was a lucious steak salad and their veal parmagiano.  Everything was perfect. 

sit at the bar and enjoy a great local restaurant in chain filled robinson"}
{"text":"I don't want to give this place even 1 star. Worst service, food was moderate at best and way over priced. Don't be fooled by the owners wine hospitality and rush to force you into an overpriced special. Very unprofessional, rude and not a restauranteur. Go to Pizza Hut"}
{"text":"$12 for a soda and a beer. Didn't bother eating there as the service was poor (even though we were one of two tables occupied) and yelp rating was dismal. The place seems to be way overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"Ok, let's start with this...I am not from the Western PA area. So, my palate is NOT like the home crowd. I lived several years in New England, Texas, and Asia. So, my tastes lean toward original, authentic and bold flavors. 
Noticed from a lot of reviews that the tastes of the food was the biggest complaint. If, you enjoy most food from this area, you're probably not going to like Ciao. The couple next to us lived in Italy and said that this is the first place since moving to the Pittsburgh area that they found almost \"authentic.\" Fresh ingredients, mouth-watering flavors. Forget it being Italian food, it is the best FOOD I have had since moving to Pittsburgh in 2008....BTW, as for Mexican food...don't even try to mention a place in this side of the state...it doesn't exist. 
So, basically, I'm saying...if you want as close to authentic as possible while being in Pittsburgh, this may be your place, but, if you like bocca di beppo or some other traditional \"Pittsburgh\" hot spot...this food may come as a shock to your pallet."}
{"text":"We went here for New Year's Eve dinner and the food was great. Service was spotty but I can understand because this is a new location and I think they might have been a little overwhelmed. Although we didn't get them, the risotto balls looked like an awesome appetizer. We didn't have time for dessert but the ones we saw passing by looked pretty good. If you like beer, you have to try the 412 ale that is brewed specifically for the restaurant."}
{"text":"I love their wine and appetizers but it's way too pricey for the area. The owner is so friendly and fun, and I love the homey feel. But please bring back the happy hour and you would get more business!!! I always recommend this place, but I have to say, I don't visit as much because they took away the happy hour."}
{"text":"At first I had high hopes of a good Italian restaurant that is void of that Pittsburgh take on Italian that can be found at so many run of the mill places.  However my high hopes were quickly diminished.  The owner likes to talk a good game, uses a lot of Italian words that aren't related to the food that he is serving and talk about wines that he servers and then never tells you the name.  The food, outside the meatballs is bad.  The thin crust pizza tastes like it came out of a box, the fried zucchini was dripping in grease, and my dinner, \"paddled\" veal cutlet was bland and boring. The pasta served with dinner was over cooked and mush.  On the food side, the sauce wasn't bad and the Tuscan bean soup was good.  I won't be back and stay away!"}
{"text":"The service was typical Pittsburgh: short, curt, slightly gruff, if not entertaining. The food was typical Pittsburgh as well: tasty, and well-prepared. So why the two stars? Sloooooooow. We waited for everything. Waited to get menus. Waited to put in orders. Waited for orders to come out. Waited for the check. Waited to get check picked up. Waited for check to come back.
And I get it that it's ok to wait. But the restaurant wasn't busy, and we waited an inordinate amount of time for all these things. Speed things up and I'd add two more stars. Seriously."}
{"text":"Just getting back from vacation, the holiday inn airport van driver recommended this place when we mentioned going to Bravos. Wanting to try new places we went. I wish we would of went to Bravos. I had rigatoni and meatballs. $18. The sauce was terrible way too thick and did not taste good. The meatballs just fell apart and were mushy. My mom had lasagna, it was served in a bowl. It was covered on cheese that it  did  not look like lasagna. Could not of had many layers. She said it was ok.  The owner was buzzing around catering to the people spending money on alcohol, from reading the other reviews is quite expensive.  The plate for the dipping oil for the bread had se red pepper purée and adding the olive oil did not make it any easier for dipping and did not taste good. Go to bravos. Better food and prices."}
{"text":"Nice ambience, great music. The owner seems really knowledgeable about his wine list and his menu. But the food is such a disappointment...it's such a build up to be disappointed with the food, which should actually be the highlight of a place like this. I ordered a pasta with tomato basil sauce, it was unclear if I had ordered a tomato basil soup with some pasta in it or actually a pasta dish...recommend for ambience definitely but not for the food"}
{"text":"Good food, good wine, and good company - a girl can't ask for much more than that. With the prominent Italian population in Pittsburgh, I have always been surprised that there aren't more authentic, family-owned Italian restaurants. Apparently I just wasn't looking in the right places! Not sure why the reviews are so mixed - I thought Ciao! 2 was great.

I will start with the wine. I was flustered after a long day at work (and was also on my first first-date in years), so I was in desperate need of a good class of wine. Being at an Italian restaurant, I foolishly ordered an Argentinian wine, at which point they made an alternative recommendation which was fabulous. To eat, we started with the crab dip which was mixed with mascarpone cheese and Italian seasoning. It was delicious - I could have skipped the pitas and eaten this with a spoon. The tortellini soup was a bit wonton-esque, not in a bad way, and quite filling. I had ordered the gnocchi special as my entrée, and despite how much I had already eaten, I managed to clean my plate. I know that was probably not good \"date etiquette\", but I couldn't help it - it was so good!

All in all, I am so happy to have found my new go-to Italian restaurant. It is conveniently right on my way home, so I hope they do takeout orders!"}
