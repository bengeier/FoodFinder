{"text":"So glad they have the best breakfast sandwich ever created pork roll egg and cheese on a hard roll. This Jersey special is so good. The hard rolls they have here are the best!  I also had their home fries which were also great. This is easily my new breakfast spot when I am in Charlotte."}
{"text":"When a friend of mine at work told me about this deli, I was excited to go check it out.. I will say that the corn beef at Katz's deli is really good. I was a little surprised at the price range. I think for the price of the sandwich, the sandwich should have been  larger. Both the size of the bread and the height of the sandwich.  The sandwich came with a pickle, which was awesome - and a little bit of coleslaw which to be honest it was quite drab in flavor. While we were having lunch, a gentleman walked in looked at my sandwich and said is that the sandwich for this price? And I said yes it's very good, to which she said you're paying too much and walked out. If I could give Katz deli one piece of advice, I would say the price point for your sandwiches should be 795 or 895 tops. Or else the sandwich should be big enough to rival any Jewish deli in New York, which currently it is not."}
{"text":"Katz deli is a no fuss kinda place. It's just good, old fashioned deli food. Casual and relaxed. I tend to come here frequently when I want a sandwich or a fantastic bagel. Big portions, nice people and family values make me a frequent supporter of this restaurant."}
{"text":"I too was excited to hear Katz Deli returned to the area. Stopped in the other day and what can I say. As a former New Yorker, I was very disappointed! Ordered pastrami on rye and a Dr. Brown soda to go, $14.73! The rye bread was stale and the pastrami was terrible. The pastrami was dry, thinly sliced and had no flavor. The pickle was so salty, had to stop eating it. Something made me sick as a dog. They have a 92.2 health rating, now I know why. How does a brand new restaurant have a rating like that? Don't waste your money or time. With their prices, they won't last long. $15 for a sandwich and a soda is priced like an entree, spend that at a better restaurant. Sorry guys, you failed this 2nd attempt. Won't be going back. Gave 1 star for the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Picked up a to go order of   Corned Beef on Kaiser Roll and I finished the sandwich off on the ride home.....even without anything to drink. Meat was warm, juicy, and tender; roll was warm, soft, and delicious. Yes its a bit steep at $12.00 for just a sandwich but it does come with a whole pickle and small serving of slaw so throw in a bottle of water and you are not far north of the cost for a \"meal\" from Chick-Fil-A. Thank you for reopening and being closer to my house than you were previously. Look forward to going back when I can sit down and have at that Ruben!"}
{"text":"We were super excited to hear that Katz had reopened, but our first visit to their new location was not the best. We ordered our favorite corned beef on rye and while the corned beef was tasty, the rye was stale. I didn't even finish a half of a half. Additionally, as we were eating I had a direct view to the line where they were making sandwiches. I watched as a lady (with her gloves on) came off the line, removed her phone from her pocket, did somethings on her phone, turned back towards the line and began trying to put her phone back in her pocket. She still had her same gloves on as she struggled to find her pocket. She lifted her shirt, moved her apron and finally found her pocket. She put her phone in and turned immediately and went back to making sandwiches. Kinda wishing I had not ordered a sandwich...ugh! Lastly, the standard pickles no longer come to your table. We did get coleslaw, but really missed the pickles. Not sure yet if we will come back."}
{"text":"Good food! Excellent service. Will happily take the fan back for some pastrami and corned beef!"}
{"text":"FYI- this says the location is Providence Rd but the map is showing the correct location of Elm Ln in Ballantyne. This deli is in Camfield Corners beside Bi-Lo.   I know they just opened, which is why I gave two stars instead of just one...hoping they can redeem themselves. Here's a rundown:    1. $18 for 2 breakfast sandwiches. My (very basic) bagel sandwich alone was $12. 2. Bfast options were listed, but bfast sandwiches were not. Also, bread options & bagel types are not listed.  3. To be called a deli, the bread options are terrible. Cheap loaf bread. The bagel was tough to chew. Seriously....If we are paying this much for a sandwich, where is the good bread?? 4. The sandwiches we ordered were a bacon/egg/cheese sandwich and a lox bagel \"all the way\". The bacon/egg/cheese was lackluster & was served on cheap white loaf bread. The lox bagel came with lox and cream cheese. That's it. No onion. No capers. Lame-tasting bagel. Twelve dollars.   Not happy with the way our experience went this morning."}
{"text":"Thank god a good deli in Charlotte ! I was going to get my hair cut n forgot to eat n I was hoping to find some thing quick to eat. When I saw a deli I was shocked! Great sandwich n pickle n slaw!"}
{"text":"I love deli food especially New York style deli food so when my dining mate and I saw  this  Deli we decided to go there for lunch . It's a small place and all the tables were almost full at lunch time  One orders at the counter and the food brought  to your table.  The menu is all on display boards plus you can look into the counter deli case to see such things as noodle pudding, knishes, deli salads and deli meats etc. The place is clean and comfortable and the staff are friendly.  Prices are moderate.  We decided to have the Reuben which was featured as Charlotte's best . A large open faced sandwich came to the table : Jewish rye bread, Russian dressing, corned beef, sauerkraut and melted cheese . This was a large sandwich and we shared it. It was large enough for one  very hungry diner or for 2 people to share . With it came a little container  of non mayo coleslaw and a kosher dill pickle . We also had Doctor Brown's diet cherry and cream soda which we took out of the beverage cooler . The sandwich was very tasty indeed but truthfully the bread and  corned beef nothing close to the Rubens we've had in New York City  at the 2nd Avenue and Carnegie deli's . The coleslaw we had was just average in our opinion. We would certainly go back and try some other things from the menu  such as : Breakfast ( egg dishes ) and lunch to include, soups,  (matzoh ball) salads, ( whitefish,  chopped liver etc ) burgers, dogs. ,and of course thing such as Nova,  lox   offered too , as well  as many other deli menu choices ."}
{"text":"This spot is evidently the new location. The old deli has closed. I was hoping for a pastrami on rye like NY & Chicago BUT...I got mostly bits & pieces, not good. Their \"house mustard\" was just OK. Why not have some choices?"}
{"text":"DONT GO HERE! My husband and I got the Reuben and the pastrami sandwich with 2 sides. Total was $33!!! They failed to tell us that that the meals already come with a pickle and small cole slaw. The pastrami sandwich was literally bread and pastrami haphazardly put together. No condiments or cheese. The Reuben was open faced and the bread was tough making it hard to cut and eat. The pickle tasted like a cucumber dipped in salt. After waiting for 20 minutes for food (sandwiches), they forgot to give us a side so my husband had to go back up there. We were excited about having a nice deli so close to home. Needless to say after this experience, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great sandwich. People who complain about pricing obviously have never eaten at a New York deli before. You pay for what you get. There are 3 size options for the sandwiches. People who bash the service don't understand the restaurant is new and still learning. Great rueben and awesome fries. Come in and try it for yourself before listening to some random stranger on Yelp."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that Katz is back! I love the brisket on kaiser roll and you can't go wrong with the pickle and slaw. I'm looking to go there for breakfast too."}
