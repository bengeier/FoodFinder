{"text":"Tried Restaurant Oriental Ngan Dinh out on a cold and rainy April day, after finishing class early at HEC (this also happened to be the closest spot to the HEC Decelles building). I was very pleasantly surprised by the taste of the broth, as it had this little sweet touch, which I love in my pho broths. The portion was a bit on the small side for a \"large\" portion, but overall, I loved the soup and was happy to discover this new spot.

{"text":"We have been going to this restaurant for almost two years. The food has always been \"okay\" and the service less than \"okay\"... why have we kept on going? Because our favorite Vietnamese restaurant is closed on mondays. Well - today - will be the last time. They sat us at a table that was lopsided. The waitress brought us water - noticed the table was very lopsided and that just leaning a bit on it left spilled water. Did she do something to fix it?... no. So I got up to try and find a \"matchbook\" - which no one has anymore - and took 3 business cards instead. I folded them and put them under the table leg and fixed it. The owner FREAKED!!!  He came over - pulled the table and pulled the cards out and pointed out that they were business cards. I pointed out that when they sat us at that table they knew it was lopsided and the waitress noticed too and no one did anything to fix it. And that his (cheap looking) business cards probably cost $20 for 500 cards.  He says we should have asked. I said we shouldn't have needed to ask - if they cared about their clients - They should have fixed it without being told. He then tried to fix it with napkins (does that cost much less?? Now he wasted napkins and business cards) but was very angry and did not end up fixing it. He pulled the napkins back out and walked away . We decided to leave. My husband forgot his hat - went back 2 minutes later - went looking - asked the guy- and he said no - I saw no hat. Then he proceeded to slam the chairs on the floor that my husband moved to look for his hat. Like I said last time. !!"}
{"text":"My fiancé, a couple of friends and I found this small restaurant while walking on Côte-Des-Neiges street. We were looking for a Chinese or Vietnamese place  that was not too far from the metro.  While the prices were cheap and the location was convenient, the four of us agreed that the food was very average. We all had tasted better elsewhere and there was nothing remarkable about it - a meal quickly forgotten. We had quite diverse plates too; one friend had beef with rice, her boyfriend had shrimps and calamari, and my fiancé had General Tao chicken. I, being the only vegetarian in the group, had to take the only vegetarian option on the menu which was white rice with vegetables. I was a bit surprised because I usually have no trouble finding vegetarian options in Asian restaurants, though this place had none but one, and no tofu whatsoever. Oh well, it is what it is!  Regardless of my personal lifestyle and diet, I would have probably given them a better rating if only the service had been good. While the waiter did her job, she didn't speak nor smile. When I asked about vegetarian options before ordering, she left without a word. A few seconds later, what must have been her manager came and pointed on the menu, spoke the name of the dish, and quickly left after I nodded my understanding.  Ngan Dinh is not a bad restaurant but, in my experience, it is neither good or memorable. They do what they must do to keep the place running, which is serving okay food and bringing water - the strict minimum."}
{"text":"Lunch combo is from 8.95 to 12.95, with soup and spring roll. Portion is big. Special daily discounted appetizer. Tuesday's is wanton in peanut sauce.  The basil fried rice is good. I also tried the satay chicken (9.95$). The chicken has this fatty taste. I don't like. There is wifi."}
{"text":"This place is a family favorite of my friend in Montreal, and I was lucky enough to go with him and his cousins one rainy night last summer. They knew exactly what to order, and I just followed their lead. Everything was fabulous: we all got some version of the Tonkinese Soup, which in the US we would call Pho, and the broth was some of the best I've ever had -- my friend says it's the best in the city. Chicken, shrimp and rare beef were all excellent choices, and you can add extra vegetables for a small charge.  But the main attraction here were what they called Peanut Butter Dumplings. This sounded pretty gross to me, but they were quite delicious: steamed shrimp wontons in a savory peanut sauce. We got several orders for the table and ate them with hot sauce as an appetizer.   Prices were very reasonable (about $10 per person, including the appetizers) and the atmosphere is nice and cozy, but the service is awful. The young man who was helping us was brusque and uncommunicative and several times left the table while we were speaking to him. Very odd, especially since the group I was with had been coming as a family for years. They shrug it off because of the amazing food and value, so I did the same. It was a great experience regardless of that hiccup."}
