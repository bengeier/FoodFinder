{"text":"This place burnt down early this year and it has not come back.  Seems gone for good. Shame, it was good when it was intact just a bit expensive."}
{"text":"Great selection of rolls, many that I don't think you'd find elsewhere. Greatly recommend the flaming hot plates (literally on fiya!) for a new experience, jalapeño apps are TO DIE FOR! Fairly priced, definitely worth every penny. Friendly staff and great ambiance. Will definitely try to make it back there to try more menu items.  Stuffed jalapeño apps - should have ordered a dozen....they were the best thing done with jalapeños... EVER. Veggie Tempura Plate - Tempura broccoli?!? Should have gotten JUST that, ridiculously tasty Volcano flaming hot plate - quite hot, I would want to try a flaming hot plate with more flavours involved, tasted like a Japanese chorizo sausage. Spider roll - amazing flavour even tho I was hesitant on the asparagus inclusion. Very large roll difficult to grab in one mouth full, trying to bite apart proved hilarious."}
{"text":"The food is incredible, really fresh and they give ya the good stuff.  It's pricey but for the quality it probably won't get too much cheaper elsewhere.  Service is nice and the atmosphere is pleasant."}
{"text":"I work right around the corner from Osaka Sushi (at Dundas West and Bloor) and I seriously order spicy maki set every time I eat here.  The lunch special is only $12.95 and the rolls are HUGE.  You get a fresh green salad with some yummy miso soup.  I can say that I eat a lot and this one meal fills me up HALF WAY THROUGH.  I usually have to go the rest of the day being hella stuffed but it doesn't matter cause their food is soo good!  I recommend calling in 10 minutes before if you're picking up.  It's usually not too busy during lunch but just in case!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the decor and the service.  The only issue we had was the rolls were HUGE. I couldn't fit them in my mouth, and we all know how biting half of a sushi roll goes..."}
{"text":"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this sushi restaurant. It is owned and operated by a Japanese family. The decor and atmosphere is authentic Japanese. The kitchen is open to customer view and meticulously clean. The sushi is fresh and the presentation of meals makes for an excellent dining experience.   You can also call in an order and pick up to take home which is nice after a long work day."}
{"text":"Get the spanish roll and the vegetable tempura. Some of the best sushi I've had. Brought a friend from the States recently and they couldn't get enough of this roll. The salad it comes with has the best dressing."}
{"text":"The the sushi was amazing. I got the dragon roll which came with soup and an amazing salad.  I loved this place will defiantly be going back."}
{"text":"I wasn't blown away by this place. It's pretty, in a traditional Japanese restaurant way. The food was ok, but I've had better in Toronto and paid less for it. Service was adequate (which is actually better than most Japanese places, so that's something). If you're in the neighbourhood and want sushi, you could do worse, but don't go out of your way to eat here."}
{"text":"Osaka Sushi...I grab lunch here about twice per month. The dining room is very zen and peaceful and the staff are extremely helpful, friendly and knowledgeable.   Their fresh and delicious maki rolls are my usual go-to, but I've also enjoyed their Teriyaki, Tempura and Katsu entrees. I've always had a good experience at Osaka with their food and service, but one thing that I must say, is that they are rather expensive. Being one of only two sushi places in the immediate area though, I guess they can get away with it. They serve large cans of Sapporo!"}
{"text":"nice atmosphere, good service, good portion. the salmon tasted great and the size of the sushi and sashimi are generous.  Will go again if I'm anywhere near."}
{"text":"First time at Osaka but won't be the last. The Spanish roll is incredible. Sashimi cuts were huge. Nice staff and atmosphere. I left a piece of tuna sashimi on the plate and they removed it from my bill assuming that I didn't care for it-have never experienced that before. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed by this restaurant today. The chef has changed the rolls to oversized creations with way too much rice and very little fish. The spicy choices aren't spicy at all. The edamame was prepared as if it came directly from a frozen package. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"There are many Sushi places but few Sushi Masters....this gentleman has many years of experience and it shows......no all you can eat poor quality here just super fresh generous portions.....even the plain rice is better here... Quality rice cooked perfectly.... I recommend the Chirashi generous slices of Sashimi served on a bed of rice....I saw some of the Korean dishes ordered by others and they looked awesome....Im going to try that next time!...now for an afternoon nap"}
{"text":"Osaka has been around for a few years, but closed a while back due to a fire.  They re-opened recently, after extensive renovations, and I'm very glad they're back.  I go over once every week or so.  The food is always fresh, well prepared and gorgeous to look at.  The sushi is amazing.  The entrees are always brought to the table very quickly.   There is an extensive menu, with many options for people who don't like sushi.  There are lots of noodle dishes, tempuras, BBQ'ed meats, vegetarian dishes, soups, dumplings.. The list goes on.  The bento box meals are one of my all-time faves.  The service is quick, and friendly.  It has a very relaxed atmosphere, clean and tidy, and the new decor provides booths with some privacy as they have large partitions between them.  This restaurant is one of those hidden gems that you need to experience.   The price might be a bit higher, but the food quality is excellent every time.  I've never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Definitely this place is over rated and this is not a 4 star sushi restaurant. It did not meet my expectations. Staff were nice and professional. The location was also good. But everything is scale of a 3 star sushi restaurant not a 4 star sushi restaurant!"}
{"text":"Osaka has been our favourite place for sushi in the West end and we are going to miss it when we move! Favourite dishes include their yaki udon, tuna dragon rolls, rainbow rolls, and the tuna and salmon sashimi. Ingredients are always fresh and high quality; sashimi is beautiful colours and top notch. The service is always friendly and attentive and the restaurant itself is adorable and cozy. Finding a replacement in the East end of the city will be tough. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for basic sushi in Toronto. Good quality at a fair price point.   I ordered from UberEATS and when the delivery guy came, he gave me a bag first outside of the insulated branded delivery bag, insisting that the restaurant wanted him to make sure the cold food was kept separate from the hot food. As they should. Nobody wants warm sashimi.  The yakitori skewers were delicious! So much flavor in the chicken and onions & peppers. The tempura was a nice mix of shrimp, squash, potato, broccoli and green beans - crunchy not too greasy.   I will order from Osaka again"}
{"text":"I truly love Osaka. I was extremely please when I discovered it had reopened after a fire. It's close to home and you get a complimentary, wickedly peeled and presented orange at the end of your meal to cleanse the palate.  I always get the same thing here... miso, wakame, tempura and the Hawaiian Volcano Roll (see my pic). Yup. It's on fire! It's warm, crispy and covered in that Japanese mayo stuff. And it's on fire!  Hint: Don't eat the Hawaiian Volcano Roll too quickly. Because... well you already know."}
{"text":"THEY ARE AMAZING.  No joke. First of all they give you a small salad and a miso soup with your sushi - even takeaway - AND this amazing establishment let me stay outside with my dog, wait with him (since he gets nervous being outside alone and Im nervous leaving him).  Not only that, they brought water out for him!!!! I was so blown away by the kindness and how they went above and beyond.   The sushi itself was super delicious and I savoured every single bite. The Spanish roll!!!!!"}
{"text":"Guysssss they have PLUSHIES in the booths now!   On a more serious note - this is some of the best sushi for the price point that you can find in Toronto. Dinner for two is usually $40 after tip. Five stars for what it is. Obviously I'm not trying to tell you this is Yasu. I'm trying to save ya'll from the plethora of other 'meh' sushi along Bloor.  Staff is so nice and polite. Did I mention the spacious booths and hamster plushie? Go for some really creative specialty rolls if you're feeling ~crazy~, or a nice sashimi dinner that is well executed."}
{"text":"Everybody get your roll on, everybody get your spicy salmon roll on!  Yes are you near the Junction and looking for a place to fill that Japanese void in your belly?  Well this is the place!  Osaka, is a cute little Sushi restaurant that has a nice little vibe, friendly staff and great food.    I come here for lunch often, and the daily lunch specials are a great deal!  For $15 you can get your roll on, along with a nice variety of sides, salad and soup with your meal.  The food comes out pretty fast and furious and it's always super fresh.  I've never had a bad piece of sashimi here, which is a bonus because you can't say the same for a lot of Sushi places in the Six!  This place is great for privacy as well, the booths are clean, tidy and make you feel like you're in an important business meeting.  Staff definitely make you feel welcome, and they don't charge for smiles, they're free!  Bonus:  They have punch cards as well, so you'll get a free meal for all your loyalty.  These rolls ain't loyal!"}
{"text":"I ordered dinner from here last week.   The rolls were soft and fresh, the rice was tasty. My husband really enjoyed his bulgogi. The spicy salmon roll was actually spicy.  The only thing I wouldn't get again was the salmon sushi pizza. I love the crispy rice, but the dish just didn't work for me.  I'd defiantly order from here again and recommend Osaka sushi."}
{"text":"Great sushi experience.  They have fun little booths for privacy or tables and chairs by the window if you're in a social mood.  Our server was prompt and kind.   We ordered appetizers (edamame and yam tempura) and she brought them out while we negotiated which rolls to try. Side note: they only had veggie tempura, but accommodated our request for only yam, which was fantastic!   We settled on threerolls. Two were good, but the Hawaiian volcano came out with FIRE! YES FIRE!!! So it was automatically amazing!  The meal included the standard salad and soup and a delicious or get as dessert.   At they end we got to pick out papers as part of their two year anniversary celebration. My friend got a \"try again\" but I won a fancy Chinese mug.   Overall a fun experience.  A bit pricier than I normally would pay for sushi,  but it was good food, and you gotta treat you self every now and again!"}
{"text":"It's a bit pricy place in town but the foods are delicious. Their Yaki Udon (stir fried Udon) is the best Yaki Udon I have ever had. It has shrimp and mussel with a sweet taste! And their stuffed jalapeños appetizer is also delicious!  The service is good too."}
{"text":"Looking for somewhere to eat after High Park. Ended up walking down bloor looking at Osaka Sushi.  The interior decor is very nice, and you may be able to sit in one of the booths if you're lucky.  They offer a variety of sashimi, rolls, and bento boxes, but I think the extensive list of rolls to choose from is quite impressive.  Hot tea is offered free of charge. Rolls average $12-15, but if you pick some good ones it should be alright.  I ordered the Hawaiian Volcano roll and the waitress mentioned it may take up to 30 mins, which was fine. It came in about 15 mins, served on a stone plate, with a ring of fire. surrounding it, which is quite a sight. It also tasted great, with fish inside the roll and fish on top."}
{"text":"I usually don't go the area, so went in this restaurant by chance.   Dispute my worry, they provide decent sushi for their price. Staff were very friendly. Interior was a bit too busy for me and there was some space needed to be organized - in my opinion, but they were OK.   I probably go there regularly if it's in my area."}
{"text":"I've lived down the street from this place for years. Super friendly staff and its a nice little intimate place that never gets too busy but still seems bright and lively. I lvoe catchign up with friend i none of their large booths.  A tiny bit on the expensive side but nothing crazy but definitely worth it. I lived in Japan and in Northern California by the bay  =and have eaten sushi since I was a kid in this city (If that means anything to anyone?haha) and have developed a taste for good vs. ok vs. bad sushi. But this place has the best sushi I've ever had in the city and its consistently good. the Rolls are huge so maybe the price isn't as much as it may seem. Best Roll: Chef's Roll a full meal on its own. Also you should try the Hawaiaan Volcano roll...why? just try it . You'll thank me. Tried it? Your welcome. Don't tell your friends about it util its brought to your table."}
{"text":"I really like the food and the employees.  They are slightly more expensive than other sushi places, but you are receiving fresher food, so to me that's a win-win.   I would recommend this place!  Also they have cards that get stamped and after 7 visits I believe, you receive a free small appetizer. The appetizer they offer is listed on the card.  Great idea I think. :)"}
{"text":"Come here for dinner after watching the cherry blossoms at High Park.  I got the chicken teriyaki bento box combo. It comes with miso soup. The bento box consisted of white rice, California roll, gyoza, salad & teriyaki chicken. The California roll & gyoza were pretty standard stuff.  Where the dish failed was the teriyaki chicken itself.  It tasted bland.  It seemed like boiled chicken with some teriyaki sauce put on top.  It was not grilled like some other restaurants."}
{"text":"At first glance it seems a little pricey, but good quality sashimi and huge portion sizes - the dinner bentos have a lot of food.  Not impressed with the tempura - dense and soggy.  ...been back quite a few times, as its my local. Upgrading my rating. The staff are always friendly, and the portions are huge."}
{"text":"This place was good. Service is nice, location is clean and with cute little private booths, and the menu is quite large.   I ordered the sashimi and tempura bento box and my friend ordered one of the roll sets. The food was fast and good. Tempura was hot, and rive and fish were fresh. Cute little oranges came at the end of the meal too, and salads and soup come with most combos!  It's a little pricier than what you can find elsewhere, but I've come to realize that's just a side effect of being in the city.    I would come back if I were craving sushi!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Very cozy atmosphere and the staff is very nice. The food is delicious and you get a really cute 1/2 an orange for desert. I especially loved the \"tuna lover's roll\" and the \"chef's roll\" and my daughter loves the \"agedashi tofu\" appetizer. We tried their new \"stuffed jalapeños\" and they were pretty good too :) We came here just as they were closing up on a Friday night and they were more than happy to seat us and take our order even though no one else was there! The prices are very reasonable and I am happy to say that they serve wine! Some sushi places don't which just boggles my mind!"}
{"text":"Reopened recently (I guess less a month or so) after a fire, as far as I know.   Nice traditional look, quite expensive, I've had better sushi. I like the service, though. I asked what fish they had for sashimi and my server knew exactly the fish they were serving that night. I didn't like their red snapper, but the salmon and tuna were nice and the butterfish was delicious.   Miso and green salad were ok, and I like the complimentary orange. The price was a bit expensive for what I had."}
{"text":"I got red dragon and better fish with delivery. The quality of fish was not good. Expensive as well. Too much rice with roll. I barely enjoyed the food. :("}
{"text":"Should I hold sushi restaurants uptown to a different standard than downtown?  I thought about this for a while but for consistency's sake, I really shouldn't.  I came here for a family dinner because my boyfriend's cousin recommended this place.  I don't want to sound like a sushi/ ramen snob but I did not enjoy the dinner.  The slices of fish on top of the nigiri sushi were really thin, the tempura batter wasn't fluffy or light, and the ramen was overcooked as well as lacking in flavour.  The maki rolls were alright for their prices.  There's really nothing more I can say about a place that's obviously not authentic without sounding overly critical.  However, even for its own category (well priced Korean/Japanese hybrid), I've had better."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here. I always enjoy their rolls! And I love that they're not the tiny sushi rolls, they're pretty big. Also, the staff is amazing! Always friendly and attentive to your needs. This is probably one of the best sushi restaurants I've been too. Must try: Spanish roll! So amazing!"}
{"text":"The modern Japanese style semi private booths at here aren't something you come across often in Toronto. However, despite the more ornate (albeit somewhat sterile) furnishings and the very pleasant service from the friendly older couple, the food is just okay for their considerably higher price points. However, considering that this isn't sushi row in the middle of the Annex, Osaka Sushi offers a good product with little competition, so can understandably charge more.  On my maiden visit, I conducted the good ol' chirashi test and was satisfied with the large selection of thinly sliced fish, traditional (layered v.s. chunky) tamago, and avocado atop properly flavoured Japanese rice. The salad dressing on the appetizer greens was also notably flavourful and the miso soup light.  During the initial run through, I found the DVD special on India (in Japanese with English subtitles) interesting, but when I realized that it was on a loop, it began to lose it's appeal."}
{"text":"Definetely best rolls in the neighbourhood!  Salad sauce is delicios, too"}
{"text":"Happened to be in the area and after reading the great reviews stopped here for lunch. The outside of the restaurant is frankly a bit off-putting, but inside is clean and cozy, with semiprivate booths -- though we were unlucky to have some very loud patrons in the booth next to ours. The bento lunch is inexpensive, generous and filling, with a rich miso soup, small salad, fried tofu cubes and fried veggie dumplings (2 of each). I had the sashimi lunch, and the fish was quite good; simple, unpretentious serving, tasted fresh. The menu has a number of decent vegetarian options, including tempura and rolls (tried one of my  partner's shiitake rolls -- nice). All in all, pleasantly surprised and impressed."}
{"text":"One of my favourites in the area. I really like the rolls- have a huge selection and the rolls are quite large. Bulgogi and spicy chicken are also quite good.   My favourite is the chefs roll and mountain roll.   A really nice sushi spot."}
{"text":"We came here for a family dinner with three kids and the service was great from the start. They were super nice, brought the kids special chopsticks, crayons and bowls. The food is a whole new level of awesome. The sashimi and sushi was the best I've had and I've eaten my weight is Sashimi and sushi. Seeing I achieve my weight by engaging in committed and consistent gluttony that is some serious sushi intake. Their Hawaiian roles were awesome looking and tasting. The Tuna lovers roles were SPECTACULAR. Sushi sweats were accomplished by all. Can't wait to do it again."}
{"text":"I scream, you scream, we all scream for sushi. SUSHI!   OK, my creative juices are drained today, and that's not my best intro, but I'm full on delicious Oasaka Sushi, and I want to tell you about it. I had California rolls, small green salad, salmon sashimi and spicy tuna rolls and it was delicious.   The way they do the spicy rolls is the chopped-up-and-shmooshed inside the roll thing, which isn't my favourite, but really it's a small price to pay for tasty treats from the sea.   Little Lady Lazy likes: They deliver with Just-Eat. Even at lunch time."}
