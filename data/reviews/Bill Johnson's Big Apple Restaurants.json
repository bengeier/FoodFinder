{"text":"i wasn't in an objective frame of mind, given that i was a visitor from another state and was willing to try just about anything local. that said, this place left a smile on my face.  maybe it was the 1950s-era big neon sign out front. maybe it was the fiberglass horse on the roof. maybe it was the kitchy old-school cowboy-themed decor inside. maybe it was the fact that our waitress wore a holster and 6-shooter. or maybe it was the sawdust all over the floor.  side note: sawdust? really? WHY? aren't they concerned about people slipping and hurting themselves?  we ordered breakfast and it was good. it's hard to screw up eggs, hash browns, and bacon, and they didn't. yum.  i'm glad we didn't go to IHOP."}
{"text":"The service is good, the atmosphere is great, the food is poor.  I ordered the supposed to be rib-eye steak, about 1/4 inch thick, large size, poor texture.  Came with green beans, so over cooked they were not for consumption, BBQ beans that were too sweet, a roll that crumbled before I could try it, the baked potato was good, but no chives.  Being fair minded, I did not try the house specialties, that being BBQed ribs, they may be good.   This is a place that has great potential, a little management would put this place on the map.  The iced tea was good."}
{"text":"This is not the Big Apple from my childhood. I have tried this place twice in 8 years, they ran out of ribs the first time and food was just not good the second.....waitress was cool and a bit cooky, couldn't make up for the meal though."}
{"text":"There's only one thing I get at BJ's, and that's the all you can eat BBQ beef ribs, so if you are planning on getting anything else, disregard this review.  I've been to all sorts of rib joints in Phoenix, but nothing beats the classic BJ's on VanBuren when it comes to BBQ beef ribs.  For $15, you get all you can eat, tender as hell, tasty ribs.  I usually top it off with one of their 22 oz. special beers for only $2.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Great food, good portions size. Everything taste great.Missy our server was awesome!"}
{"text":"I love the food here.  Not only does it taste very good, but the portions are great for the cost.  I agree...the workers are friendly.  Plus, the place just has a nice feeling about it!"}
{"text":"Was passing through Phoenix a few weeks a go staying near the airport. Went to this Big Apple for dinner. Service was not that great, seems to be operating at half speed. Not bad service but slow service. Having said that the food was pretty good. I had Chicken Fried Steak dinner. The steak and gravy were quite good but the sides were almost too small to be called sides. Wife was about the same for her brisket platter."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed taking my family to Bill Johnson's, but on our recent visit (2/29/12) the quality of the food, the portion sizes, and their new prices have took a turn for the worse.  The bbq pork ribs were tough as leather, the fries were very greasy and portion controlled to the max, the mac and cheese seemed like they just poured liquid cheese on top of the boiled macaroni, and to make it worse, the prices on the menu have skyrocketed.  I feel that if their going to charge more for their menu items, the quality of the food and portion sizes need to be changed as well.  I was very disappointed with the amount of money we spent for the crappy food we ate.    Furthermore, I expressed my concerns with the waitress, but she didn't seem very interested at all.  With that said, I will NEVER return to Bill Johnson's because of the BIG let down.  This was once a great place to eat, but after they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, this restaurant went downhill."}
{"text":"From the start this place is dark like Batmans cave. After that the world changes the staff act as happy the the lolly pop guild!  Then you have to order what they call food ??!!!    It's gold for you're tongue!! We ordered the beef and noodle soup 5 stars. Then we were happy we split the smokehouse sampler you gotta be a big hoss to finish this one. It comes with pulled pork, brisket and the best damn ribs I have had in a coons age.  So if don't try this joint your as messed up as a football bat!!  I WILL BE A. RETURNING"}
{"text":"Breakfast was fantastic! The Snakebite Scramble has the most incredible pork chili (like a dark chili verde) that would rival 9 out of 10 breakfast places. Prices are reasonable, and we had great service. The yelp reviews make me cautious to try it for dinner, but you can take my word for it- breakfast was great."}
{"text":"Best to stick to the apple pie.  The breakfast  especially the sausage is reflective of the prices. Cheap."}
{"text":"My younger brother and I went there for breakfast/lunch. Typically, I have to deal with the prejudice and rudeness of waitresses on whether we are able to \"tip good\". In this instance, I felt incredibly comfortable and the waitress was Astounding. Never have I received such respect and she made a point to engage my younger brother in their \"reward scratchcard\". It was a wonderful experience and I am planning to go again this week. Wonderful service, full of fun and lighthearted atmosphere. I tipped a good 30% for their kindness and enjoyed the overall atmosphere. I am astounded by the amount of negative reviews."}
{"text":"Bill Johnson's seriously upset me! This is the second time my family and I have went and walked out angry and disgusted. The first time was back in 2007, I believe in second chances so we went back. Now I wish I stuck with my first impression.  We  went in 10 am and waited for 10 mins. to be seated.  The seats, table, salt and pepper shakers, menus, glass divider between seats, and hanging décor were covered in grease and dust. The dust was so thick it was hanging! GROSS! There was 6 inch hole in the wale by my seat.  I stuck a menu in front of it in case of a rat came out.  Mind you I would have left, but my husband is sweet and doesn't want to get up and leave.  A young girl came and took our order.  She didn't make eye contact and had I could care less attitude.  But, she was very personable with the other tables.  She sat and chit chatted and hugged a few of the people.   Hmm. ok?   Ok, order taken at 10:15.  6 mins. later I get my chocolate milk and hubby his ice tea. She stuck on the table, didn't look at us and she was gone.  My milk was thick and disgusting!  Several mins. before I could spot her again and she wouldn't even look our way or even pass by.  The manager greeted and floated between tables near us, but never came by to check to see why were sitting there.   I am livid now! It's been 40 mins.!  No one has come by to check on us.  Plus, to get anyone's attention was unbelievable.  From hearing the conversations everyone was from the same church.  That explains everything!  We were outsiders.  Guess what church?  Now hubby was pissed.  He had to step in front of the manager and block his path to get the man to talk to us.  It has been 50 mins. The waitress noticed the manager by our table and made a \"how dare you!\" look at us and turned to get our food.  30 secs. later, she brings our plates and walks off. No word or eye contact.  My country fries were burnt and both our plates were cold. I hit the roof! The waitress was at the table in front of us and she was sweet as come be to them. Hubby grabbed to get the manager. She said, \"u huh.\" and walked off.  The manager came over aloof.  He only offered to recook the food.  No look of apologizing or even surprised.  I will never ever go back or recommended this hell hole to anyone."}
{"text":"The reason my husband insisted we have a meal here was because we drove by twice and the parking lot was FILLED! ( plus he liked the lights and theme) we had breakfast our third day in Pheonix and I swear on BACON this is the best breakfast spot in the free world. The eggs, the buttery toast, the taters ( both are great)  and my bacon... Which I had to ask for crispy, but when I did it was PERFECT! ..... Everything was great! We had breakfast here for the next 7 days straight.... And even had dinner and lunch on a few days before our 10 day trip was over....  I have considered an overnight trip JUST for breakfast reasons alone. But the icing on the cake was Beth! She was our waitress almost every time. If I could afford to move this entire restaurant and Beth to a location LAX adjacent, I would do it today. I have never missed breakfast the way I do after being spoiled here!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have lived in 11 states in my lifetime ranging from Boston, Virginia, Chicago, Central Illinois by St. Louis, New Orleans to Central Texas, and my family is from Nebraska, and have been to the contiguous 48 states.  I LOVE MY BBQ! I have also been cooking in restaurants for 25 years. I still think  that Tony Roma's may still have the best Baby Back ribs.  Yes, I said it even if it nullifies my review!.  Tony Roma's out of all the hidden gem Ma and Pa places that I have been too in Memphis, New Orleans, Fort Worth, KC, still provides fall-off-the-bone ribs with consistency every time!!!!  LOL.  My wife and I work hard, so most nights we are not wanting to cook and get delivery!  We are missing New Orleans since both of us have lived in that region, so why not get some Bar-BEE-cue to indulge in and have leftovers for the next day.  Okay, Bill Johnsons it is since that is what we can get delivered.   After spending nearly $60.00 to tantalize our addiction to a feasty pork feast (yeah, that made some of you squirmish), I was really disappointed!  OMG is an understatement!  How can you go wrong with any barbeque-smoked stuff?  What we ordered was a Smokehouse Sampler, Trailboss Dinner and a Cobb Salad. It was a feast for any two people with leftovers for work the next day. Their BBQ sauce is the St. Louis type you usually get, but tasted more like Arby's Sauce watered down. Is there Big Apple in it, I don't know.  It was very bland and nothing that was impressive at all.  I would put it at the bottom 3 bbq's that I've ever tasted.  The sides were delicious!  Mac n cheese, garlic mashed and Baked potato were fabulous, but the portions were very small in to-go cups. I've had better baked beans in a can, though, and wish they would add some of their smoky fixins in them to liven it up.  Come on, have two types if you're wanting to please everyone at least.  Bummed out!  The ribs were the worst I have ever had! They tasted fishy to me and I had to pull the meat off the bone so hard that I thought all of my crowns were going to come off! I know there are different types of ribs, but why did it taste like fish and so chewy?  The brisket had a lot of fat on them, which made my wife lose her appetite immediately. Don't you know to trim this after it smokes? I have to say the pulled pork was delicious, but the sauce ruined them.  The only thing my wife liked was the chicken. The cobb salad was okay, but the smoked ham was the thing that I could taste and was satisfied filling on the cobb salad and sides, not the barbeque stuff. I liked the smoked ham!   All in all, maybe we had the wrong things at this place, but I won't waste my money on this place ever again. Also, where is the cornbread? This place needs to go try other barbecue places and see what makes them unique.  That is what makes these places unique. I also couldn't purchase sides and wanted to try some of their other sides since that was the only good thing we had.  Try again on your recipe for the sauce.  Sorry guys, but very disappointed."}
{"text":"Soooo thought I was going to be in for a big meal.... In for a big disappointment.  Tuesday night. 6 people on the entire restaurant and they're OUT of 10 oz steaks... REALLY? ? Didn't even offer to upgrade up to 12 oz at 10 oz pricr. Bunch of CRAP. We left. STILL HUNGRY"}
{"text":"I am not from the area. I don't know the history. I don't know who Bill Johnson is/was. All I know is my experience on this Wednesday evening. It would be hard for me to recommend this to anyone. I was staying at the HGI and decided to walk down the block to experience this place and it's history. I would not recommend walking as this is not an area to be walking around in at night. The host was also the busser. For a slow night it took her awhile to clear a table for one person. I was told to try the chicken fried steak, supposedly a signature dish w/ Mac and cheese and baked corn. With a side of mashed. The best part was the wait for the food as the beer was cold and my server was quick to bring another as my meal was slow coming out. The steak had a frozen taste, the mashed potatoes had onions in them and the sides were not tasty. By looking at the measured portions they are struggling with portion costs. Usually not a good sign. I found myself in a hurry to get out. The best thing I can say is the staff was pleasant and making the best of what I am sure is a tough situation."}
{"text":"I liked the Big Apple. Close to the airport if you have time for a short taxi ride to dinner why waiting to fly. Great time filler. Great filling country food. Great place for a good steak.   Very fun ambience :)"}
{"text":"I've had significantly better steaks for less money from chain restaurants (Texas Roadhouse, etc...).   I expected better of a steak-house in Phoenix, AZ. This place gets a lot of airport traffic and seems to act like it.   I ordered a 10oz steak, with mashed sweet potatoes, baked beans, and steamed broccoli. I also ordered a croc (read: cup) of chili.   Starting with the chili: It was good - not great. It is also, apparently, an original recipe from 58 years ago. I am not unconvinced that the original recipe involved opening a can of Hormel chili, heating it up, and adding julienne red onions.   As for the steak, it was cooked to order and wasn't awful. The server brought it with a bottle of A1, because even they think that it needed seasoning.   The sides came in small aluminum foil cups not much bigger than the paper cups your 4th grade teacher made you swish fluoride out of as a kid.   The baked beans were pretty tasty. I wish I had more than 3 bites of them.  The mashed sweet potatoes were also tasty. I wish I had more than 3 bites of them.  The head of broccoli appeared to be steamed... no sin."}
{"text":"Myself, my husband and our son went on a Thursday nite and we were one of three tables there (at 7:00p) and it is as stale and boring as last time we went (years ago.) They got the steak and I got a sandwich (nothing else even sounded good).  My husband liked the green chili Mac n cheese the most and the toasted bread of my club sandwich was so dry it cut not only my palate but my mouth as well.  I could not eat it!  Steaks were smaller than before and the sides were just ok.  My onion rings were over fried, dry and tasteless. My husbands first beer on draft was Bud and $1.50 and the re-fill(?) was billed as a Coors and $2.50?? He swears it was a Bud!! Probably will never go again since there are many better choices to eat in that area. I did like their raspberry tea though."}
{"text":"The waitstaff were kind and a gentleman with a (boston?) accent was quite helpful and friendly as well! The food was fantastic. My husband says the food was \"amazing\" as well. We would definitely hit the place again!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  Good wait staff.  Quick service.  She is carrying a gun.  I would too if i worked on Van Buren."}
{"text":"I recommend that you visit this place when you have the time to take in the sights and sounds.  This place has a cowboy type feel with sawdust on the floor and cowboy decorations all around."}
{"text":"best country fry steak every time i come to phoenix i need to stop here"}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience.  I haven't been to a Bill Johnsons in YEARS and we happened to drive by this one and decided to stop in.  The parking lot was full so I thought that wad a good sign.  I thought wrong.  It was a bit dark inside but I figured that was part of the\"feel\" of the restaurant.  Wrong again.  I think they keep the lights low so you don't see how filthy the place is.  Now I'm not a stuck up yuppie and I love finding those little hole in the wall places that look like crap but you get great food. This wasn't one of those places. I ended up being completely grossed out by my food.  My husband order a steak with some sides,  I ordered a burger with blue cheese and sweet potato fries and my daughter ordered chicken strips. My husband was not thrilled with the steak but he ate it.  I got my burger and it looked like there was melted Swiss cheese on it.  I asked if that was blue cheese and the waitress looked at me like I was retarted. Hmm...I'm used to crumbly blue cheese but obviously know it can melt but this looked like it must have been under a heat lamp for a loooong time.  Whatever I was hungry.  Grabbed my lettuce and tomato and thought WTF?? The tomato was practically mush and the lettuce was wet and limp. So forget those.  Bit into the burger.  That cheese was NOT blue cheese and the burger was a weird gray color.  As I'm chewing the burger I look up as someone is going into the kitchen. FILTHEST kitchen I've ever seen at a restaurant.  First and last bite of the burger.  Took the chicken strip out of my daughters hand and wouldn't let her eat it. End result, we ALL felt like shit that night and we barely ate anything.  I can only imagine how we would have felt if we finished the \"food\". Not surprised this place is closing soon. Shut the damn doors already!!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here because I've worked in this general area since 2002 and have never patronized this establishment.  I was wise not to do so.  YUKKKY.  I ordered a ruben, which seemed safe.  The dressing was overly-sweet, as was the coleslaw, which was my only salad option.  The fries were the thick-cut kind that never seem to get crisp.  Just simply awful."}
{"text":"Where to start? I remember eating at this chain 20 years ago, when I was a child. Now I know why my parents stopped taking us there.  I would wager none our food was made fresh, save perhaps for one of my family member's beef ribs -- which looked to be so overcooked, they passed \"dry\" sometime in the early afternoon. Everything tasted either canned or made from frozen. The chicken fried stake I ordered verged on inedible, and was clearly an overly deep-fried frozen steak. The mashed potatoes were awful and pasty, to the point I would swear the simply scooped the inside of a baked potato and put it on my plate. If there was a trace of cream or butter in them, I couldn't detect it. The baked beans were clearly reheated out of a can, as were the green beans. For dessert, the apple pie was runnier than the soup that started the meal -- a beef barley soup that looked of refuse.   To top it off, the service was awful, with our waitress consistently forgetting requests and appearing about as often as my mother-in-law's urge to keep her nose in her own damn business.   I can only imagine that this chain is still open because of the nostalgia. Stay away if you actually want to enjoy your meal. If all you want is a floor with sawdust, food that takes no more than a deep-fryer and a microwave to prepare and inattentive service, this is your dream restaurant."}
{"text":"Stay away from this bad BBQ and sides. Meat was dry and covered with too much sauce in an attempt to hid the dryness and sides were bad at best. Mac and cheese was terrible and beans were store bought. Service was good and friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent food if you know what to expect (steaks, burgers, cowboy fare). Their BBQ sauce is awesome. I plan to buy some and bring it home with me next time I'm in town. I love that the drink choices include sasparillo, flavored teas and creme sodas. This place is very kid and family friendly.  Our waitress Bonnie was very nice and her outfit and attitude was a nice compliment to the cowboy atmosphere. You have to try this place. It's a  Phoenix tradition.   The location was once a decent section of town but that was long ago. I didn't feel unsafe here, even though we were there after dark, especially with all of the new construction in the area. But it's right next to the icky side of downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Hey yall....from the looks of this place from the outside it reminded me something off of a John Candy and Bill Murray Movie...which had me extremely skeptical about the food and it didn't change one bit once I got on the inside, but my brunch mate assured me that it was all good....wishing you could see my face....Once I quickly ordered a Hot Chocolate it's kinda like a test of the kitchen in spots like this and I was BLOWN...and so ready to order...so I got the chicken fried steak(not one of my favorite meats)..eggs with cheddar cheese oven roasted potatoes and a side of pancakes....THAT ISH WAS DELISH....I was actually drooling over my plate....This was a hidden gem much like myself never judge a restaurant by its parking lot sign.....toodles"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the singular honor of serving me the best country fried steak in my 42 years of life unfortunately a week later they served me the worst charcoal briquette they had deluded themselves into calling a country fried steak. If they were consistently bad I would just never go there. If they were consistently good I would be there twice a week. They are however consistently inconsistent. If they retrain the chef and the manager I would love to come back but how they could let something so burnt out of their kitchen, that they knew was substandard and badly burnt as they hid it by covering it with the gravy before they took it to me. It only worked until I got home and took my first bite."}
{"text":"I visited this location after my boyfriend suggested it as a place he went to as a kid. We will Never return. This was the worst BBQ I have ever had. I had the pulled pork platter and it seemed as though it had been sitting under a heat lamp all day and was like eating bbq leather shoelaces. The beans that come with the meal were no good and neither of us could eat the mashed potatoes that came with the meal as they tasted musty,like they did not use fresh potatoes. The bast thing about the meal was his salad and the chicken and rice soup that tasted like campbells. The waitress wasn't very concerned and still tried to offer us dessert after we said we didnt like the food.  I was charged full price for both meals even after we stated we were disappointed. We had a four hour drive home still hungry after a disgusting 33.00 dinner. Save yourself time,money,and disappointment and DO NOT eat here."}
{"text":"I used to go to this restaurant, long ago. I stopped going to this one long ago. That's because of the following event: I had taken a large group of people there for a get together including my entire family.  We placed our orders, the waitress got us our drinks, our food was brought to us in a reasonable amount of time..........but.  She brought us no napkins.  We were eating BBQ, you MUST have napkins with BBQ.  Well, we were eating it anyway without them.  Eventually, our drinks ran out - me and BBQ? Must have fluid, lots of fluid!  This was going on 25 minutes without a waitress showing up and I finally got up and got the napkins.  I then started refilling the drinks at the counter.  Yup, just helped myself.  Dunno what happened to the waitress, but this deal was beginning to put a damper on the festive spirit and I was determined to deal with it myself.  Well, that got that attention of management, who came storming over and demanding to know what I was doing there.  I looked at this guy square in the eye and asked him why he hadn't been so incredibly concerned about the service at our table - which was non-existent - if he was paying so much damned attention to what I was doing at the drink bar which is supposed to be for employees.  \"Where's our waitress? It's been 30 minutes now and no sign of her, we have been waiting for napkins and refills, I finally decided to get them myself since YOUR employees aren't going to do it for us\".    You wanna know what happened to our waitress?  REEEEEEEALLY? HER SHIFT WAS OVER AND SHE WENT HOME!!!!  I can laugh about it now, I was PISSED at the time.  This woman just up and left us stranded.  We had JUST started eating when she had dumped the food on our table and took off.  It's not like we had been sitting there for half the night and it was time for us to leave.  This stupid manager still had tude' written all over his face.  His apology was pathetic.  His offer of a \"free dessert\" was even more atrocious.  Give me 50% off the meal and I'll be happy.  We didn't eat their free dessert, everyone at the table was equally as appalled at this restaurant, that manager and the waitress.    I footed the bill and we left and I have NEVER gone back to that place.  Edited: Here's the really funny part for me: I am a REALLY good tipper when I get great service.  Not unusual for me to dole out 25 to 30% tip regardless of how large the bill is.  I was at Denny's the other day and got SUCH great service for the kind of place it is, I tipped $25 for a $11 meal, lol.  Hey, you gotta tip em'.  They aren't making any kind of hourly wages, what is it, $4.00 per hour?  Just throwing that in there, if you are going to go to a restaurant and you get good or even okay service, PLEASE tip that person.  Without the tips, they sink. Well, when your waitress goes home and you get a manager with a pathetic attitude, what do you tip?  Yup, the age-old penny.  If I'm going to be insulted, I'm going to dole it out right back to em'."}
{"text":"The food was great my wife and I shared a sampler plate too much food to down in one setting"}
{"text":"You can hear your arteries clogging as soon as you sit down but this place is decent especially considering the location (Mmm Van Buren Red Light district).  Wild west atmosphere and hay on the floor, the waitresses carry 6-shooters and you can hear the spurs clicking around.  Their breakfast is everything you'd expect from a greasy spoon and for dinner their pulled pork is decent. The portions are huge and ive been there many times and never had an issue with the staff.  usually its an elderly person w/ a friendly demeanor.  You can find better but this place has history that adds to the appeal."}
{"text":"AWESOME breakfast!!  If you're looking for a huge country breakfast that the west was built on, this is the place for you. Earrrrrrly one morning I came in and had the chicken fried steak & eggs. I ordered my eggs omlette style with cheese and the biscuit on the side with my usual trio of water, coffee and OJ. I couldn't finish it all it was so much food! But everything was good, especially the gravy. I highly recommend this place for a breakfast.   Okay dinner   I went here the other day for their once famous BBQ. I had a trio platter of BBQ Brisket, grilled chicken breast and hot links. I had it with a side salad (that included their ah-mazing cinnamon french dressing!) and sonoran mashed potatoes. The potatoes were gawd-awful! I had to send them back and replaced with a baked potato, just was just ordinary. The hot links weren't t hot, just a couple regular sausage links. The brisket was smothered in their sauce which is good, but the beef didn't have any flavor itself. It seriously could've been tofu and tasted the same. However, the chicken was well prepared and had a nice char to it.   The service sucked each time, refills were hard to come by and it took FOREVER to get the bill. Not great if you're in a rush.   To my yelpers I say: Come for breakfast only, have low expectations for service here. and if you MUST come during dinner hours, try the grilled chicken salad. It seems to be the best combination of their food offerings. This place won't be open for long, as I read online that they are about to close to become a parking lot. Kinda sad to see a Phoenix institution go down like this, but hopefully that bbq sauce will remain on store shelves for years to come... now if only they'd add that french dressing to the store aisles!!"}
{"text":"This place loses a star for well... scrappiness.   I have been going to all the Big Apple restaurants forEVER!! I love this place. It's serious comfort food! I dig the beef ribs, they're all you can eat and they'll ask you if you want more. I can never handle more than two platefulls. However... if you get a cool server and are polite, they just might let u take ur leftovers home! :D   I like the  meals, seriously - I do. But they come with so many SIDES!! It's overwhelming! So what I usually do is ask for a double salad and skip the corn & baked beans. they're not that great anyway... the beans that is. But I know a lot of ppl who love the hell out of them, but they're not me."}
{"text":"Love it  great lg portions of food great service and awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been into Bill Johnson's. The first thing I noticed was that they had removed the sawdust from floor. I always thought that that was a cool trademark of theirs. The food we received was average to below average. The fries were soggy. The mayonnaise was served to us in squeeze packets, that seemed to be old. The service was mediocre at best. I'm sure that it will be a long time before we go back there again."}
{"text":"This is one of several locations.  We really enjoyed our dinner here.  Prices were great. The bbq was good.  I really liked their bbq baked beans.  So yummy!  Their bbq chicken was good as well."}

{"text":"Stopped here to get some food real quick. I had a Santa fe Chicken Sandwich. It was not anything special. The place was kind of overpriced too since they food is not that good. Go here if you are desperate for some grub."}
{"text":"I'm not happy its gone, but no wonder. I'm an AZ native and have been going here since the early 70's. They used to have a simple menu and they did everything right....then they greatly expanded the menu (to try to compete in an ever changing industry), cut costs and quality on ingredients, and died.  I will always remember the days of the huge, made to order hamburgers, crispy steakhouse fries, and the deliciously lean, sliced (not chopped) bbq beef sandwiches..along with the sawdust on the floor and the guns in the holsters!  Also the prospector scene has been broken since I was a kid, which doesnt help this review!  Happy trails pardner!...and like the sign said \"Hungry, well lets eat!\" (somewhere else)"}
{"text":"Horrible experience, bad service, sub-par food."}
{"text":"This place passes the A&A test big time (atmosphere and attitude).  From the moment you first see the towering neon sign with \"Let's Eat\" blazing in the night sky, you know you've just hit the dining jackpot.  The place looks like it could have been decorated by the Duke himself (the horseshoe door handles are a nice touch).  The waitresses are all very friendly (their outfits include holsters with six-shooters).  I've been to the original location a couple of times but tried the Mesa restaurant last night.  Everything is prepared just right.  Meat, potatoes, BBQ beans--what's not to like."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to go here because of mixed Yelp reviews, but ultimately it was too convenient to my hotel to pass up.  I don't regret the decision at all--I had a great steak with a good selection of sides, and the service was great as well.  I could see this being a regular destination if I stay nearby very often."}
{"text":"I thought this place rocked. We've been in for dinner and breakfast and both were fantastic. I love the fact that it is kid friendly, there's LOTS of seating, it hasn't been super crowded with long waits yet and the service has been great. We'll be in for breakfast on Mother's Day! Can't wait to have another serving of chicken and waffles!"}

Bill Johnson's Big Apple VanBuren is this place.  Having been in the food business for many years back in the day and walked into most restaurant back doors in the valley you can taste the difference here at Big Apple. All the salads, slaws, gravies and desserts are made from scratch. Taste the flour in the chicken fried items.. Taste the tenderness of cowboy beans pre-soaked from 100 lb sacks. This is a real cowboy restaurant that still does food the old fashioned way."}
{"text":"LOVED THE CHICKEN FRIED STEAK!!! I will be honest, as long as a place has a good C.F.S, I'm in!! Been here plenty of times growing up. Check the website, maybe even call, but find out the specials that way you know what your gonna get... Next time Im gonna try the Apple Pie topped with a SLICE OF CHEESE???....."}
{"text":"one of three tables in the resturaunt. waited ten minutes no service at all not even a drink order.  When we went to leave the bartender-waitress told us to not let the door hit us on the way out. yepppp wont be back ever.."}
{"text":"Bill Johnson's has been in the valley forever.  I think its time for them to go.  My wife and I have tried it twice and both times it has been horrible.  The service is bad.  The waitress was rude, slow and needed work on personal hygene.  The food was not very good.  I ordered a hamburger and fries.  The burger was very dry like it had been under a heat lamp for a long time and the fries were pretty much the same way.  I still cant figure out why whenever I drive past this place the parking lot is full."}
{"text":"After arriving to my Ramada hotel on E Van Buren after a nighttime airplane flight, it was around 8PM and this part of town north of the airport is absolutely dead on a weekday night.  Luckily Bill Johnson's was open because who knows how much further I would have had to walk to get to a place to grub on some late night food?  The cobb salad I got was ginormous and for the price (less than $10), it was quite a satisfying late night filler.  All that chicken, feta cheese, lettuce, and bacon bits made me very happy going back to my hotel afterward.  I couldn't help but notice that many of the weekly steak specials were a helluva deal but I can't speak for how good they really are.  I was the last one eating in the restaurant and the staff there was very patient and not rushing to get me out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Arrived at the Bill Johnson's W. Indian School Road location on a recent Sunday morning. It was recommended by some friends who live in the area. They didn't exactly rave about it, but they said it was good so we gave it a shot.   Ample parking available in the lot...wasn't sure if this was a good or bad sign, but we proceeded inside to find a restaurant that was devoid of customers. There were a few people inside, but we had the place all to ourselves for the most part.   I really liked the \"western\" decor of this place, even though it is all inauthentic. The wood chips scattered throughout the floor, the horsehoe door handles...all very nice touches that add to the good vibe of this place. Our waitress was extremely friendly and did a terrific job, making sure we had plenty of coffee refills. I wish I could remember her name because it is worth mentioning. Great service. Unfortunately, the food here is not up to par with the quality of the service we experienced. I ordered a Wrangler's Special and although it was edible, I could have went to McDonald's and got the same quality. The french toast was fine, average at best, with some powdered sugar on top. But the eggs and sausage were far below average. We are talking McDonald's quality here. Again, it was edible, but it tasted like pre-packaged frozen eggs and sausage that was thrown in a microwave. Ever watch the people at Dunkin Donuts make their breakfast sandwiches? All the ingredients come pre-made and frozen; simply throw it in the microwave or oven and serve. I hate to think that Bill Johnson's does the same thing. Even though the food was lacking, you do get pretty decent sized portions for a relatively cheap price. You're not going to go home hungry here, but who wants a large quantity of food if it really isn't that good to begin with? With such wonderful service and good sized meal portions, it's a shame that the food lags behind a bit."}
{"text":"Not awful. The chicken fried steak was good. My dad wanted to go because he grew up going there, so I was excited. When I left, I didn't really see what the big deal was, but I didn't leave hungry!"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night and the place was empty. I ordered the special for the night Prime Rib. I had a good meal. They have received a lot of bad reviews but I will go back."}
{"text":"Went there on a Deal Chicken coupon for lunch.   We were seated quickly and the waitress came and brought our drinks on a timely basis while we perused the menu.   I had a pulled pork sandwich which was fine, not particularly interesting but OK.  However,  I did have a sample of the Green Pork Chile which was surprisingly spicy and pretty good.  The side salad was romaine which was a plus but for the first time ever, too much bleu cheese dressing, which I did not think possible as I love bleu cheese dressing. I did like the sweet potato fries that came with it.  My general impression was that it was like a Denny's with OK food to get you by but certainly nothing you would seek out except for reasons like it was close by, etc.  Prices were inexpensive for most of the menu."}
{"text":"I love the country feel. The staff is very kind.  Food= overpriced for what it's worth. I had a flavorless steak. It needed spices and was really tough. The Sonoran mashed potatoes tasted weird, the broccoli was old, and the macaroni and cheese tasted fake.  Sorry Bill Johnson but I don't think I will return."}
{"text":"We just got back from a surprisingly delicious breakfast at Bill Johnson's. Hubby had the Range Rider omelet with hash browns and biscuits and gravy. He especially liked the warm melty cheese on top and it was chock full of fresh veggies. The biscuits were super soft and fluffy, with a texture even better than the flavor. The gravy was a tad salty for his taste.   We both thought the hash browns were excellent. I normally don't even eat the hash browns that automatically come with many breakfasts due to their excessive greasiness and weird taste. I inhaled these. They were not greasy, but were perfectly tender and moist with great fresh flavor.   My over-easy eggs were well cooked and the toast came dry with a side of butter, which I also appreciated. I hate it when the toast comes basted with griddle grease. The chicken fried steak was very tender and tasty- not the best I've ever had, but better than most I've had in the Valley. The coffee was weak but not acidic at least. The portions are tremendous, so there will be no need for lunch. I also took home about 3/4 of my platter-sized steak, so that'll be dinner too.   The service was friendly and fast. We were very impressed that the deaf man who was seated by himself right before us got a waitress who knew sign language. I don't think you would find someone with that skill in most fine dining places. Yes, the neighborhood is sketchy, and yes, the restaurant is darker at breakfast than I would prefer, but will we be back for sure."}
{"text":"Another disaster. Scummy food in an even scummier area of Phoenix. I have to start with the fact the they WILL NOT refund your money once you pay for something. So in my case, I ordered a famous apple burger extra well done to go with a side of mac and cheese that they claim was baked (it was not). The mac and cheese was pasta shells covered in a creamy cheese flavored sauce, about as appetizing as squirt cheese out of a can. Ok we are back at the hotel room and the burger is woefully undercooked and I call and say I'm coming back and just want a refund, but not here. This is the only place in America where you are forced to get something else because of some dimwit policy of no refunds. So, they are saying if I find a cockroach in my initial order, I'm really going to want to order another item? Insane. Fine, I dash back before closing and order the chicken sandwich. This is a sorry piece of chicken breast on a soggy bun, just like the burger with condiments straight from the year they opened -1956. The french fries that arrived with the chicken were solid grease - not potatoes mind you - just basically heavy potato grease. The crazier thing is they included a free mac and cheese with 2nd  order and that looked nothing like the first order. WTF? This version looked exactly like kraft style with those thin pasta tubes, etc and I'm pretty sure it was (see photo). Will the real mac and cheese please stand up. Then the waitress tells me that she has never heard of any restaurant returning money in her life. What planet is she from and what is wrong with this dump?  Oh, the apple burger was a mess also, sloppily prepared, strange sliced apples on top of cheddar cheese and more lettuce than the big salad on Seinfeld. Two cops were hanging out here and I felt like telling them I got robbed because basically they took my money and wouldn't give it back despite the lousy experience. If I had started this process at 5pm, I swear I would have tried 10 different things and kept saying I don't like it and see if they would have returned my money then. Theives. Stay away."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant and staff. Food tasted good. Ordered ultimate BLT and chicken wings - all very good and large portion."}
{"text":"Had to wait for 5 minutes until the hostess finished her crossword puzzle to be seated.   The inside smelled more like a plastic factory than a restaurant.   The chicken fried steak brought back memories of chicken fried steak day in elementary school - tasted more like something from a plastic factory than a restaurant."}
{"text":"The place makes you feel like you're in the Wild West. Fun, upbeat western atmosphere. I had the sirloin and barbecue shrimp which was great. Good selection of side dishes. I had the Corn Bake, which I've never even heard of and loved it! I also had the Green Chile Mac and Cheese which was tasty, although I personally would've wanted more green chile flavor. I was with a party of 5 and everyone enjoyed their meal. One of my co-workers got the Will Bill's Ribeye Steak and it was huge, and he said it was delicious! If you're nor a meat fan, my friend got the Sautéed Whitefish and it was very good. Portions are large. Good barbecue selection. Definitely check out!"}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast! ! The AZ omelet is outstanding. The biscuits and gravy are delicious.  I'm so sad that they closed this location :(    what happened? ?????"}
{"text":"Cold, inexpensive beer, burger excellent, mashed potato ball awful, sweet potato fries good, cole slaw average, sliders and pulled pork sandwich excellent. Service very good.  Spicy BBQ sauce excellent. Low prices.  Overall, 4 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Okay -- It's a bit quirky yes.  The food isn't all that great.  My ribs were cold when they arrived.  I got sick that night.  Enough said."}
{"text":"After driving to AZ from Southern CA & making a stop at the Phoenix airport to pick up an addition to our group we found Bill Johnson's. What a fun, retro place!  The staff was friendly & very welcoming & they offered great bits of information on the food and the history of this fun, throwback place.  They serve breakfast all day. One in our group ordered the yogurt, fruit & muffin plate. It was very nicely presented & plentiful in it's portion. I ordered fill potato skins which were crispy & quite yummy. Additionally, I had a cup of their chili ...which was delicious with just the right amount of kick!  My friend had a steak with broccoli & a baked potato, which looked great & she said the steak was perfectly cooked & tender. We took some desserts to go, pecan pie & carrot cake. Both were enjoyed.  The restaurant itself is like being inside an old west tourist attraction. The walls are filled with novelty items that are both interesting & just fun to look at. It's a cool place with good food."}
{"text":"I wish I would have read Yelp before eating here, but fresh in town, tired and hungry and now, disappointed.  Based on just my meal, this place is a one, but there were 3 of us and the vote was a two. The menu sounds good, but the actual food is not....."}
{"text":"Can't tell you about the food cause we never got any. After a 35 minute wait we walked out. Check out the other reviews and I concur. Don't hate your self and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"HOW does this place have an average of 3 stars???  I am giving one star because there's no way to go any lower!  Eeek!  I have lived in PHX for more or less 25 years.  It's been at least 22 since I've been into a Big Apple and now I remember why.  There was a large group of us - and we came in at staggered times.  I know this is a hassle for the server - as she got the orders technically correct and all the seperate checks were accurate, I will say our server, Juanita, was completely acceptable.  I would say I prefer my servers to have all their key teeth - but that's just snobby and irrelevant to the service, so I'll let it go.  Food - the value here would be great for a steakhouse - if it was good.  The zucchini app for the table was A-OK.  It's a mountain of sliced breaded and fried zuc - and it was fried right and served piping hot. The salad dressings threw me off a bit.  No regular Italian or Balsamic Vinaigrette - but a RASPBERRY vinaigrette?  At a value steakhouse?  The French dressing is a CINNAMON French.  Not bad...but I'm not a fan of dessert flavored iceberg lettuce. :) For entree, I chose the ribeye with baked potato.  The potato was fine.  I wish I could say the same about the meat - but I still can't figure out how they managed to make a rib eye tasteless.  It was on the rare side of the medium rare I ordered - and with that much fat, it should have been delicious. But, no.  Not a morsel of flavor to be found in the whole 12oz serving.  (Half was consumed for next day lunch - the extra aging didn't help. :)  In fact - my dog wasn't even impressed.) Nothing wrong with the corn on the cob - as long as it's cooked I think that's hard to mess up.   I am guessing the baked beans were ok  - some people must like the cloyingly sweet 3 parts brown sugar to 1 part bean recipe.  Personally, I am not a fan, so I didn't enjoy them.  The decor is cowboy steakhouse.  Very similar to any other cowboy steakhouse.  (LoneStar, Texaz Roadhouse, etc.)  But - that brings us to the restroom.    Parents - shield your children!  Nature called, so I went to check out the restrooms.  I understand sometimes old plumbing allows odors to linger that newer buildings don't have issues with.  As I walked the hall toward the restroom doors, the outhouse smell grew with each step. Once in the ladies' room, the smell was almost noxious.  I know it's clean and germ free in there - as the smell of bleach competed with the sewage smell.  As I became nauseated, I pondered if I'd be able to hold my breath until I was finished, put back together and hand washed.  I even considered skipping washing my hands, as we did have wet naps on the table.  Anything to get out of there faster!  (I did wash my hands, but didn't take time to dry them, and re-zipped and buttoned my jeans as I was walkling back the outhouse stinking hallway back to the dining room.)  I've heard it mentioned that everyone has thier own personal hell - not necessarily the fire and brimstone depictions.  If this is true, I will do my best to be a good girl the rest of my life - I am afraid this place with it's stink restrooms, tasteless meat and strange \"mordern\" salad dressings (strange for an old fashioned cowboy steakshouse, anyway) may very well be the hell I'd be sent to if my  good deeds didn't add up at final judgement."}
{"text":"Was told this place was famous, but I don't know why. The waitress wasn't too friendly. I got the 3-meat lunch special, which wasn't too special. Chopped/pulled pork and beef and a polish sausage with fries and cole slaw. All not bad, but not the excellent BBQ I was hoping for. Probably a decent place to get food, but nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"I've coming to this establishment since I was kid. So it is a staple for me and my family at times.  Coming for breakfast, lunch or dinner....I pretty much always get breakfast. Either the ham traditional or Bonaza (6oz steak, hashbrowns, eggs, and biscuit/gravy) Majority of the time, I will lick my plate clean ha. Its not the greatest breakfast in the world, but its my staple I've stuck with over the years. So if I have been devouring that for so long, it must be that good :)"}
{"text":"Growing up there were three places we ate at in the Phoenix area when my Dad got a good paycheck - Rustlers Rooste, Monti's or Bill Johnson's Big Apple. This place has been serving BBQ to the valley since the 50's. Their BBQ sauce has been the top selling BBQ here in AZ for years. I still remember back when there was sawdust on the floor and getting a Holy Cow (root beer float) when I behaved. But sadly, time catches up to us and Bill Johnson's has always stuck to their old ways of doing things since their opening. This is the original location and it will eventually be torn down to make a parking lot for the neighboring community college. Bill Johnson changed the food industry here in the Valley and it's now time to move forward. I will always have fond memories of coming here as a child with my family."}
{"text":"I was in here on a Friday morning with a pretty large group.  Our waiter was a super nice older guy with a Stetson and a fake gun.  Pretty much all of our breakfasts were around $5 and were quite sizeable.     And the best part: \"we have white, wheat, whole grain, rye, sourdough, biscuits & gravy...\"    \"Wait, I can have a side of biscuits and gravy in lieu of toast?  Yes please.\"  Oh, and the bloody marys are $3 during the weekday breakfasts.  To be fair, they do taste like $3 bloody marys."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Went there mainly for the individual apple pie a la mode that I loved as a kid. The only apple pie on the menu was for 2 people for $12.99. Come on!!  My beef brisket was mostly gristle covered by a heavy sauce.  Bring back the pie, please!,"}
{"text":"Based on our recent dinner, I don't think I'll ever go back to a Bill Johnson's restaurant...at least not for dinner. Breakfast there is pretty good and often times worth the miserable service, but dinner? Not again.  We went recently.  Took 20 minutes for salads to come out of the kitchen. I don't know what's going on back there, but the restaurant was NOT full and there was no need for it to take 20 minutes. Salad is the basic bagged salad, a couple of grape tomatoes with dressing in little portion cups. How hard is that to put together and why did it take 20 minutes? A question for the ages I'm afraid.   Our server was moody. She went from being friendly and interested to not filling a drink on our table in the 20 minutes it took her to get our salads out. She ignored us when she did come out of the kitchen to attend to her other tables. When she did bring the food, Dr. Jekyell appeared again and she was nice as could be and filled our drinks, only to disappear again while we ate. Thank goodness we didn't need anything because we weren't getting it.   I ordered the Ribeye special. Since I received my education in the culinary field, I can confidently say that the piece of meat I received was NOT a ribeye. Since it took so long to come out of the kitchen though, I suffered through once again thinking of my motto to NOT eat at chain restaurants again.... There was so much fat on this piece of meat that I made a neat litle pile of it on my plate for the server to notice. She noticed but said nothing.  The mashed potatoes were instant potatoes and the corn on the cob was over-cooked and dry. But it was only $12.99.  Oh and don't bother with the $2.99 margarita special. You get what you pay for and that's not saying much.   I've given Bill Johnson's many a try over the years because back when I was a kid, this was a great restaurant to go to and the food was always really good. As of today....I think the only way they stay in business is because of their breakfast. It sure ain't the dinner or the service.   I am hoping this is my last visit to Bill Johnson's but alas, I'll probably try them again in a few months hoping that they will be like they were years ago, but I'm sure reality will kick me in the gut again, much like the crappy dinner we had on Friday night. *sigh*"}
{"text":"I like this place. The food is good ( had the meatloaf with mac and cheese...grubbing! ) and the people are friendly.. like really friendly. The portions are huge and it's not that expensive for what you get.  I remember visiting this place a couple years ago and didn't think that much of it. But clearly things have changed for the better. I'd classify it as more of a family style restaurant with a western flair, complete with wood shavings on the floor.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm suprised this place has so many bad reviews, but I have to say that my experience was pretty good. I went here last week with my boyfriend during dinner time.   They weren't busy, but they weren't slow. It was nice. We were seated right away and our server came over shortly after. I made a point to get the girl's name, but I've since forgotten it (which seems to happen to me lately!). I want to say her name was Dawn, but I'm not sure.   Anyways, we ordered sandwiches and I really liked mine. I think he liked his too, but had the complaint that it didn't come with very many fries. I was happy with mine and that I chose to get mashed potatoes instead. The prices are about the same as a Chili's, but I liked this a little more."}
{"text":"Really, Really, Really BAD! The BBQ Beef brisket sandwich was so tough it couldn't be chewed. They replaced it with the pulled pork when the waitress verified that all the beef in the kitchen was that bad! The pork was like soup. Watered down pork soup with BBQ sauce on it. YUCK. Then there was the fried chicken. The chicken itself was good, once the huge chunks of bland batter were peeled off.  I like fried chicken as much as any Georgia girl, but this was just plain terrible. OK, I could go on about the \"straight from the freezer\" fish and chips, but you get the picture.  Now the service: The waitress was friendly and got a good tip. The manager was very transparent in her attitude that we were trying to get a free meal out of it. Nope. Just looking for some decent food and Bill Johnson's is the wrong place. Breakfast might be better, but I don't have anymore effort to waste finding out."}
{"text":"Welcome to the Wild Wild West!  I walked in for lunch yesterday and felt I had stepped back in time.  There was a sawdust on the floor, these large booths that were straight outta Vegas back in the day, and the servers wear guns on their hips.  Interesting place, indeed.  The parking lot was crowded, so we took that to be a good sign.  We had a large group, so we were seated in the back.  They must have thought we were a little rowdy or somethin.  Anyway, our server, who's name starts with an M (it wasn't Maria and I hate to get her name incorrect) was full of piss and vinegar--in a good way.  She is from Germany, and she is funny as hell and damn good at what she does.  She kept things humming at our table perfectly.  The menu had a good variety of choices; you can choose burgers, sandwiches, salads, and bigger plates, if you like.  Their lunch special menu was a little limited, but a good deal.    I ordered the cheeseburger, which came with steak fries and a small serving of peach cobbler for dessert.  The burger was really good and I loved how the bun was just slightly sweet.  Fries were just right...crispy on the outside and soft inside.  The cobbler was very good, although I only ate a quarter of it.  Part of my crew ordered the 3 meat special (sounds kinda risque) and when I looked around, they had inhaled their food.  It looked like two different types of bbq plus a sausage.    I had a great time here, but would love to come back and try their breakfast some time."}
{"text":"Talk about a contrast in restaurants and customer service. My fiancee and I were trying to have a nice night out, the first restaurant we went to pretty much ignored us until we got up and walked out. On the flip side this place was welcoming and our server was fantastic. She was prompt in refilling our drinks and did everything she could to make it a great experience. Her name was Marsi, want to make sure I give her all the credit in the world.  Anyway, I ordered the chicken fried chicken and my fiancee ordered the smoked sampler. Our food arrived, though our server said she was not happy with the country gravy, she felt it was too watery, but brought it in a cup so I could judge for myself. It was extremely watery for whatever reason, and she came back saying that her manager wanted to take the whole plate back so they could prepare everything again (I did not complain once, all this was initiated by the server from the start) and that I'd be comped on my portion of the dinner.  While waiting I tried a bit of the brisket my finacee had and it was really excellent. My fiancee said the whole dish was good except she wasn't too thrilled with the type of cut they used for the pork ribs, but overall it was a really good meal. My dish arrived, and it was the best chicken fried chicken I've ever had, the breaded chicken breast was super tender, almost melt in your mouth, and the breading was flavorful and light, almost a tempura style. The remade gravy was just the right consistency and really good all on its own. The side of green chile mac & cheese, something I've never had before was excellent as well, along with the steak fries, which is saying a lot since I usually don't care for steak fries.  We will back again, they helped salvage what was looking to be a bad night out. The place may be kind of pricey but from what I tried it was worth it."}
{"text":"When in Phoenix, eat at Bill Johnson's. The brisket and pulled pork were very good. Their cinnamon French dressing on the salad was a nice touch. The service was very friendly.  This would be a four star review, but the grits were served at a temperature that was far too hot, and burned my mouth."}
{"text":"We used to take my family here for the big beef ribs and sweet potato fries. I guess 2 weeks ago they changed the menu and the big beef ribs are now 1/3 of the size and they took the sweet potato fries off the menu. On top of that they raised the prices. So there is no reason to go back."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday evening with family from out of town.  I have been going to Bill Johnson's for the past 30 years and it has always been good. Thought the relatives would enjoy a \"western\" restaurant.  Have dined at the Mesa Bill Johnson's for the past 7 years.  It has steadily been going down hill.  The service was mediocre and detached, the food was average and overpriced for what you get.  Sad to say, but I don't see much of a future for this location."}
{"text":"Stop in to pick up orders. I had two pulled pork sandwich's to go. W/ fries and onion rings. Lots of pork! Best bbq sauce! Sad that it will be closing in a couple of years. Been going for years! Remember a field trip when I was in 6th grade :-)"}
{"text":"Okay, I first have to say how delighted I am that Bill Johnson's is still here, at Van Buren & 40th, just like it's always been, and it's still old-timey and full of delightful kitsch (although they had to get rid of the sawdust on the floor long ago).   That said...    What happened here?  We went for lunch on a Sunday. It was crowded, and there was a wait, but I was eagerly looking forwarding to eating here again, since I hadn't in so very long.   The staff was wonderful, the service quick, and the food... bland.  I had a BBQ burger, the Jack Daniels bacon burger, with onion rings. The meat was fine, but the bun was cold as ice, the onion rings were cold and soggy, as though they had been out of the fryer for hours (and this was at quarter to noon, so the lunch crowd hadn't even really started yet - they were still serving breakfast), and the coleslaw was bland.  I was so deeply disappointed, I couldn't articulate it.  The rest of my party had ribs, the sampler platter, and the fruit platter (from the breakfast menu). The fruit was wonderful. The rest was exceptionally bland. The fries, like my onion rings, were cold and soggy. The BBQ sauce had no zing.   What happened to my Bill Johnson's?    We didn't stay for dessert -- I'm glad, because I want to hold on to my memory of the deep-dish pies, the way they used to be. I don't want that ruined, too.  I hear they're going to be closed -- I hope not. I would hate to see that happen, even if I was disappointed in the food this time. The memories are too good to lose this place. Just get that good cook (and a decent fry cook!) back in the kitchen, and it'll be golden again."}
{"text":"We went there on kind of a nostalgia tour. I swear, the place has not changed in 50 years, except the sawdust is now gone. The breakfast was excellent, the food plentiful, and the waitress just delightful. Also, that deep dish apple pie à la mode was just as good as remembered. I think we will go back in less than 50 years!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time going to the restaurant.  I ordered the chicken and rib combo with the corn, baked potato, coleslaw, and an iced tea to drink.  The chicken was cold, dry, and tough.  Slapping on some BBQ sauce didn't make it any better.  The ribs were over cooked and dry.  The special recipe corn was nothing more than cream corn with corn flakes sprinkled on top.  The baked potato was,hard and half cooked, and I could not tell you about the coleslaw, as I never got it.  The iced tea was old and stale.  The interior was dirty, dusty, and I'm sure had not had a good cleaning in decades.  On the plus side, the staff was very friendly, and they did not over charge for the mediocre food that was served."}
{"text":"Went in here for a quick lunch, came out very satisfied! A tender melt in the mouth medium rare sirloin really makes me can't wait to get back to this restaurant, and their fresh clam chowder soup is perfection! You can't get enough of it! When you first walk into this restaurant you will notice the Wild Wild West mark everywhere, surrounded with lots of antiques! My fav is their personal made lantern that they put in every side of the ceiling! It was lovely! I definitely will be back for that steak and more!"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! It has lots of conversational pieces on the walls without being really tacky. The building has a ton of history and it's really interesting. The waitresses are always super sweet. I've never had one that wasn't funny and nice and very attentive.   My family comes here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It's rare that a restaurant has great food in all three categories.    The only problem I have is that EVERY single time I ask for something without cheese...it comes with cheese anyways. I'm not one for sending food back so then I'm forced to take medicine and bear a stomachache. Bill Johnsons just really wants me to endure dairy I guess."}
{"text":"I have been told, oh how good Bill Johnson's is, there breakfast is the best!!!! I don't think so! Daughter's boyfriend wanted to take me out to breakfast. So he took me here, he likes this place a lot. Daughter likes there breakfast a lot? I have no reason to come here a lot!!! Actually, this was my only visit. Did not impress me at all. I had there over easy eggs, hash browns, bacon, and a side of pancake. I do admit, I liked the pancakes. There eggs, hash browns, and bacon were just alright. Nothing special, no special flavor, just alright. Service was fine, other than that, I have no reason to make another special trip."}
{"text":"Never again. Small portions and food was not too good. They somehow managed to give me a dry medium rare steak! The steak fries were good but I'm sure they don't cut them there. There were 10 in our party and we were all admiring the kids food cause they at least seemed to be enjoying their chicken fingers and grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Bill Johnson's it's the best of the old West. I've always wanted to write a review on my favorite steakhouse in the world and I can now. First let me say I'm not happy ya'all took out the sawdust covered floors that was part of the whole signature of the West but I'm hoping you bring out all back. Now there sew two things well a lot of things delicious here to eat and one to begin with is the hearty salads and soups a must for anyone dining here before any dinner. Then there's Bill's steaks omg the best steaks I've ever eaten in my whole life even beats Texas 8 to 1! Plus the ribs are the best ever ribs I've ever had beating out Texas and California 9 to 1! But whoa easy does it Cowboy and Cowgirls you don't want to ever forget to ask for a side of Bill's signature barbecue sause. A sause that beats them all. Whatever reason your visiting folks in Arizona or just passing through stop by Bill Johnson's sit down and let's eat!    PS: If you go online you can order the BBQ sauces."}
{"text":"The food was good, especially the pork ribs and steak. The hamburger that I had was boring & the corn bake & macaroni with cheese & hatch chilis were not as good as they sounded. My onion rings were served cold. The service was terrible, our waitress was a poor communicator, mostly because she did not speak English very well, she worked hard but maybe she had too many tables."}
{"text":"This place has been a favorite of mine since the late 1980's.  When my ex hubby and I came over for races at Manzanta Speedway, all of the teams, drivers, crews and fans crowded into the Big Apple for the after the race meal.  When I split from my ex hubby and moved over here, this place has been one of my faves to go to.  The last time I was there, with my current hubby, we had the appetizer sampler w/the pig wings and candied bacon.  OMG they are yummy.  I've never been disappointed in the Big Apple in the many years I've been coming.  We've gone there for breakfast, lunch and dinner and it's all terrific.  I highly recommend this place if you have a hunger for western BBQ.  Don't forget to take home a jar or two of the BBQ sauce!"}
{"text":"The Big Apple was off my radar screen but my sister & Fred wanted a nostalgic \"chicken fried steak\" dinner.  Instead of my \"past usual\" pulled pork sandwich, fries and lots of BBQ sauce I \"switched\" to the 10 oz rib eye with green beans and corn.  The good news is my sister and Fred liked their meals but my tastes had changed.  The head lettuce salad with a weak blue cheese dressing in a plastic cup was not up to my expectations. The steak was very thin, luke warm and definitely not up to my expectations.  The  green beans and corn were overcooked and again not up to my expectations.  The  only item that met my expectations was the famous hot dish apple pie with ice cream.    In retrospect I doubt if I would have enjoyed my usual pulled pork sandwich either. Sorry Big Apple, you are no longer on my restaurant list."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! This is a one of a kind place and  great to bring guests to. Just brought my family here tonight and they all enjoyed it, all ten of them. I have three young boys and the decor interested them. Kid friendly! This restaurant has a good selection to choose from and the people there are always friendly and fast. The steak I had tonight was very tender, juicy, and tasted amazing. The broccoli I had for a side was the greenest I've ever seen and also tasted fresh. Hope this one stays open for years to come!"}
{"text":"I remember in the late 1960's when my parents took me to this restaurant and back then when you opened the door you would see saw dust on the floor, waiters/waitresses wearing unarmed side arms and the long waiting room which was lined with hungry customers.  I also remember a radio station broadcasting inside the restaurant and a pig turning on the spit outside, above the main entrance.  As a young adult, I remember coming to this restaurant with my dates and things did not change much. I remember my date wanting to know what steak she should order, T-Bone, Porterhouse, NY strip, Sirloin, Prime Rib, Ribeye...Tonight, I wanted to satisfy my red beef craving and decided to support the local economy, So, I came back to roots and to this restaurant of my youth. When I opened the door, there was no saw dust, no line waiting to be seated...there was no T-bone, porterhouse, ny strip, Prime Rib on the menu.  I was immediately disappointed, we discussed leaving then.    I order the large Sirloin medium rare, fries and green beans.  The steak come out rare, and I had to send it back, butterflied.  The green beens came out in an aluminum foil cup that resembled juliened  green alien looking something...other than greenbeans.  They were the worst green beans I have ever tasted.  (come on guys, go up the street to Costco and buy a large bag of real greenbeans and zap them in the microwave) Seriously,  I would not feed these greenbeans to my dog...   The service was great Joe but I will never come back. It was a sad dining experience."}
{"text":"Having grown up in this neighborhood, I've been going to Bill Johnson's for decades. One of my fondest childhood memories are the late night visits after the Phoenix Roadrunner games for Deep Dish Apple Pie. In fact, I would probably have to say that getting a personal pie the size of my head, topped with ice cream is what started my love affair with food!  BJs is consistent. Their hamburgers are tasty, their fries are crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside, their ribs are fall of the bone good, and their chicken fried steak rivels my moms.  The wait staff is attentive and conscientious as drinks are seldom allowed to get below the halfway mark. All in all its a friendly place that is good for families and singles alike."}
{"text":"Chicken fried chicken was dry but the green chili macaroni and cheese was good. Service was OK."}
{"text":"Meh, I've experienced better at this very same restaurant.  Twenty five years ago this restaurant was considered a great dining establishment and my family would go here for special occasions.  Every now and then we'll go here to reminisce and enjoy some BBQ.  Wow, have times changed.  I came here recently with my family and they had a new menu, not that great.  I had a BBQ sandwich which lead to an upset stomach all night long.  The restrooms were disgusting!  The only good thing I can say is that the service was and always has been great.  I can't imagine ever going back to this place again.  It's just too gross now.  Fair well!"}
{"text":"wish this place was more consistent in the way customer's are treated we are not.white and our waitress was Asian she ignored the he'll out of.us and.drooled over the white patrons like it was.no tomorrow we order.the BBQ all u can eat ribs the first order was great after that they were all dry and burnt, whoever runs this place should be fired have been coming here for awhile now I know.why they closed.the others.  needless to say I left a decent tip and.all I got to say people.take.pride in your.work or.let others.do it.  I have had three restaurants in my life and know a bad place when I see.eat"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Today was the first time I went back in 20 years. It was the worst experience I have ever had. Went in for lunch around 1pm. All we ordered was sandwiches which by the way the menu has shrunk big time, and we waited for over half an hour with hardly anyone else in there. The waitress was hanging on her boyfriend who came in and wad writing all over his arm with her pen. We could see our food sitting up there and didn't get it til we asked how much longer it was going to be. Also, never got checked up on. Had to wave someone down for refills. The staff were all just standing around. Then when we got our bill we were never apologized to for the LONG wait and horrible service. I am so upset it makes me sick!!!!!! Also to top this off, the person whom I believe was the manager was there during all of this and even say the waitress hanging all over her boyfriend and was laughing with her."}
{"text":"Slow service. Took 50 minutes from arrival to being served. It was 12:30 PM, asked for breakfast menu, never brought it. Had to get it myself. Asked for child booster seat; never brought it. Only 10% of the seats were filled, so it wasn't because they were busy."}
{"text":"I was first told that the chicken took longer and then later was told after waiting 45 minutes that the order was lost and \"that it happens\". I don't understand how the computer lost it or why it took them so long to realize it. Would recommend to avoid this restaurant, there are better options."}
{"text":"This is a fun family restaurant I will say the inside is quite old I was disappointed with the grease that was used for the to deep fry oil needed to be changed the coleslaw was not that great but everything else was very good the staff is young but friendly and we went on a Friday evening and it was not that busy overall this is a fun Country Western restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and mother in law ate breakfast this Sunday morning and had the worst service and food ever. The bar tender was our server and completely messed up out order. Bacon and ham was ordered on two of the plates but everyone received the lousy undercooked sausages. Yes, Lousy sausage's.For scrambled eggs the cooks used omelets and slice them up, not even close to scrambled eggs. My wife had ordered over medium eggs which came out over hard and she substituted her hash browns for a fruit cup which she never received. Shame on you Server/bar tender!! The cooks here are lousy. Rather go to Denny's where we now the cooks are trained to cook traditional foods and are consistently great with service. ONE STAR FOR THE ATMOSPHERE. IF THERE WAS A MINUS STAR SYSTEM THEY WOULD GET A -5"}
{"text":"First the good, as nothing was great... the pulled pork is good. The mac & cheese is good. The mashed potatoes is/are good. The baked potato is good.   Next, the ok...the baked beans are ok. The cobb salad is ok. The bbq sauce is ok. The smoked chicken is ok.   Finally, the eeewwwch...the brisket, the ribs, the hot links were all gross. And the ribs, in particular, had an \"off-putting taste\" about them that caused me a great deal of distress.   Never again."}
{"text":"This is one of 4 locations I have frequented over the years.  The one on Bell now being closed.  I have always liked the food, mostly going for breakfast but with the occasional lunch tossed in.  This trip around I got a Smokehouse grilled cheese sandwich which has ham, bacon, turkey, tomato, bbq sauce and some cheese.  I was stuffed.  The service was friendly as always."}
{"text":"Very good ribs and chicken in big portions. Giant ice cold beers. Our waitress was excellent. I'll try to get back there next time I visit Phoenix. I hear this is the place that will cut your tie off if your wearing one, though...so wear a cheap one you're gonna toss soon, I guess."}
{"text":"The first time we went to Bill Johnson's, we informed the restaurant of my food allergy. The server told me that my salad had no onions in it. While I was eating my salad, I started tasting onions. When I asked the server why there were small pieces of onion in my salad she said she thought she had PICKED them out. Then I found out that the wonderful homemade salad dressing also had chopped onions in it. WHAT THE HELL????????????????   Dinner was a special night so I waited for my family to finish their meals and we left. Later that evening I had to deal with the consequences of ingesting raw onions. This is a reason why I don't like to dine out and I ask about the foods that I order when we do dine out.  We could hear the server talking to someone behind the wall about a customer \"who might complain\".   I spoke with a rep from Bill Johnsons and he assured me that he would contact management at this location and would make sure that all the staff we made aware that food allergies are a serious issue and that if a customer has a special request that it is to be taken seriously. He also offered me a $20 gift certificate to come back and give them another try.  Please note:On previous occasions, I have developed serious reactions to raw onions and have required hospitalization that have lasted as long as 7 days. I'm not just someone who wants to complain and get a free meal. And for the record, I wasn't even offered a comp on my meal  nor was the manager ever informed.   Moving on.... We went back last night with my sister and it was a complete let down. Our server brought us two cups of tortilla soup with cheese sprinkled on top. The soup was barely warm  and when we informed the server, she said that she gave us the last of the soup which was scraped from the container that had been removed from the warming unit and was sitting on the counter. She said that she thought it hadn't been sitting for too long so she figured that it still warm enough. WTH?? You can make folks sick by not having foods at their proper temperatures.  The rest of the meal was okay... nothing to write home about and just meh!    Sorry Bill Johnson's... you just lost us. I would have given you at least a 2-star but my poor stomach is still suffering from last night's vomit session."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, we expected greatness. However, this place should be renamed, \"Bill Johnson's Big Disappointment,\" and here's why: We drove 25 minutes for lunch. The hostess never even looked up when we entered. No hello or welcoming smile. Gosh, everyone has a bad day, but this lady showed pure annoyance while showing us to several dirty tables. While we sat in this dark unwelcoming place, not one server offered us a drink. Thankfully beverages were finally delivered, but still no hello or smile. Those waitresses were very grumpy. As for the food, possibly the worst BBQ we've ever eaten. Even the restaurant chain, \"Texas Roadhouse,\" is better than this place. The Cowboy Philly had little meat and lots of peppers covered in tasteless gravy. The BBQ sandwich was just fair. The restaurant BBQ sauce (sold in local grocery stores) was placed on the table, and this was the best part of our lunch. Only eat here if you like grumpy service and sub-par food. Definitely not worth the drive."}
{"text":"The other reviewer who mentioned breakfast must have come on a bad day. They have one of the best country style breakfasts anywhere. Huge portions, delicious, and very satisfying. You can't go wrong with their breakfast.  For other meals... not bad. Not great, but definitely a good value and satisfying. One plus is that they serve diet dr. pepper... but not at the 19th ave and Bell location.  (?)  Nothing goes better with BBQ than Dr P.   I like their all you can eat beef ribs when i want to get into a carnivore coma. I prefer them dry with sauce on the side... then us mostly the hot sauce with a little bit o' the normal stuff.  It's a good place to bring out of towners who want to eat at a cowboy type AZ place."}
{"text":"I guess my family and I came on a bad night: as we've been there dozens of times before and considered ourselves \"regulars.\".  Slow service, one steak was tough, waitress didn't come by to check on us until after we were through.   These things happen in the restaurant business...I understand that.  The problem is that when I told the waitress the one partially-eaten $18 steak was tough, she went to the manager who sent her back with a coupon for a piece of pie, which I felt was insulting.  No apology from either the waitress or the manager...who didn't even bother to come over.    I stuck the pie coupon in my left-over mashed potatoes and we all stormed off!  I'd give them another chance, but my wife won't...end of an era for our family.  BTW I sent them a friendly \"these things can happen\" email, but no one bothered to get back to me."}
{"text":"Constrained by time, we really had no choice but to check into Bill Johnson's. A glorified sizzler at best, but man when I walked in it took me a few minutes to take in the decor. A line of faux tombstones out front, sawdust covered floors, an old-fashioned tub hanging above you, servers wearing gun holsters...you pretty much get the whole shebang. It's definitely a fun family restaurant when you're with kids, the service was friendly, but don't expect much from the fare."}
{"text":"We had eaten at the Big Apple for dinner over the years, but it seemed like someone in our family would always complain, afterward, about feeling ill.  So we stopped going only to return occasionally for breakfast, which was usually OK.   The service was fair to poor, but not terrible, until today.   I ordered 2 eggs, sausage, hashbrowns and white toast...pretty simple.  I ate it all and enjoyed it with coffee. As I finished up my toast, I noticed that the plate it was on was splattered with what looked like some type of salsa or tomato paste.  I didn't have anything red with my meal....my toast was served on a dirty plate..I pointed it out to the waitress and she said 'hmmm'. Then I heard her tell the cook about it, no apology to  me, no manager came over, nothing. We left and my wife mentioned the dirty plate to the cashier and she said 'yeah, sorry about that.'...we won't be returning to the Big Crapple."}
{"text":"I stumbled in here craving breakfast because it was very close to the airport and very close to the Aloft hotel I was staying at.  Yes, I am a tourist and yes, I am from a part of the US where cowboys are not common, so walking into a place full of country western paraphanalia made me smile.  The service was good, the food was delicious, and I walked out with a few good photos.  The coffee was a tad bit weak, but I'm a starbucks bold drinker, so I don't hold it against them."}
{"text":"I used to love cooking, and when I cook, I'm actually semi-decent.  I taught myself through trial and error and a bunch of cooking shows a few years back.  And then I went to med school.  Now I rarely cook and we tend to eat out a lot.  I'm not really sure why we keep going back here.  The staff is sometimes friendly, the food is sometimes good, and I could do without the wild west theme.  Actually, the food, especially the dinners, are cafeteria quality: canned green beans, instant mashed potatoes, tough meat. I think they should actually serve it in one of those square plates with the dividers to make it more authentic.  The breakfasts are more appetizing and really, really cheap.  THAT'S IT! Bill Johnson's is cheap and easy!  We keep going back because it's fills the belly without emptying the wallet.  It's easy to get to from my house, and easy to remember because of it's kitchy-ness."}
{"text":"The breakfast was really good and filling. The service was usually good also. We would eat breakfast here at least two Saturdays each month. The best waitress left (Luna) but she moved on to bigger and better things (Phoenix CC). Then one day.....they had a sign on the door that said they were going to close at 3 pm every day. Only open for breakfast and lunch. That didn't last long though. They closed the doors. I can only guess it was due to mismanagement. Sad to see it go because it was my favorite breakfast place."}
{"text":"It was about time I visited a historic Phoenix steakhouse. I wish I could say it blew my socks off, but it did not. I ordered Big Bills Big Whiskey upon arrival. It was essentially a huge whiskey sour. It was on. Had a lot of tartiness. The lack of a bar was disapointing. I ordered a top sirloin with beans, mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes. Everything was good, not great, but good. The 10oz steak was reasonably prices. Cooked well but could use more seasoning. The sides were much better especially the cowboy beans. The enviroment is friendly and family appropriate. Service was good and attentive; however, i was one of four people there."}
{"text":"Well, don't order the fried chicken nor the mashed potatoes nor the cherry pie Ala mode. Really disappointed tonight. Their breakfasts have always been so good so I guess I will just stick to that."}
{"text":"Old western decor, food and service is average.  They provide a decent meal if you are near the Phoenix airport."}
{"text":"My recent visit to the Phoenix area wasn't complete until we stopped here to taste the food Bill Johnson's is known for. Our waitress was on top of her game, kept our drinks full and VERY friendly. The brisket over four Texas toast with gravy,mashed potatoes,Mac and cheese, baked beans was yummy and very satisfying to the mister."}
{"text":"The West Valley is devoid of unique independent (meaning not a chain IE. Denny's, IHOP, Village Inn, Cracker Barrel, etc.) breakfast places so on my quest for something different ventured into Bill Johnson's Big Apple Barbecue.  Even though there are several locations around the Valley their website states they are still family owned.   The menu, though relatively limited, is what one would expect from a \"Cowboy\" restaurant. Country fried steak and eggs, steak and eggs, biscuits and gravy, etc. and if you can get past the surly, yet moderately capable, waitresses it's not bad.  Lately my West Valley breakfast locations are Cracker Barrel, Mi Mi's and Bill Johnson's so the search continues for a great place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Very good to excellent.  I had the BBQ combo.  The pork and beef ribs were great and so was the hot link.  The chicken was slightly dry but still good.  The sides were so so but OK.   Anne had the pork ribs and couldn't stop saying how good they were.  They were the best part of my combo too.  I think we'll go back for breakfast in the morning."}
{"text":"You can get a better breakfast at McDonalds and quicker too.  Got there at 9:30 am on a Sunday morning and didnt leave until 11:25 because of the slow cooking.  We heard the grill got bombbarded.  We ordered to of the eggs and fixin's my eggs were cold and my son's ham had been used for a floor mat it looked like.  Wife order french toast and eggs, got the eggs and meat and then 15 minutes later got the french toast that was either burned or not cooked at all it looked like.  The waitress had every excuse to use so she was use to being slow and undercooked.  Probably should have gone to Mimis and waited the 30 minutes to getin.  This was a $30 breakfast that could of been good had the kitchen had some help to pull if off."}
{"text":"I had a great meal here and excellent service. At 2pm on a Sunday, the restaurant was completely empty, which was nice. I really liked our waiter because he didn't mind customizing my meal, and he had many suggestions about how to order the meals how he likes them. I thought that was nice because he spent the time to talk to us.  He was very attentive and he always made sure our drinks were full. My boyfriend got a very juicy steak and I got a black and blue burger. The burger was small for the price tag.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Bill's is a pretty solid place for some barbeque, although the service is hit or miss. During a weekday afternoon they are usually not busy and you can be seated instantly.  If you want your rustic-im-gonna-pretend-this-is-my-barn-and-not-a-restaurant cowboy establishment, Bill's will be your heaven.   The beer selection is not supurb, but a lot of the meals some with cobbler for dessert! WIN!!  The sad news is that one time we went in for a work lunch and got a corporate discount by surprise. Then we didn't get it anymore. What's that all about?"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!!! You must try it. Bill Johnson's is a local phoenix chain. Definately has the old west Texas style decor. The staff is extremely friendly. The only problem we had is our waiter lost our order and we ended up waiting for our food forever. But the waitress compd our drinks and the food definately made up for that small error. I want to come back soon and have another awesome meal here."}
{"text":"I can tell you this I will not be a regular here. Sorry Big Apple but me no likee. You get good size portions but quality and taste is a big part of it too. chicken strips overcooked with a hard crust. .Whatever the heck the corn mush was tasted bad.  They are testing out a dark loaf of bread was supposed to be served with meal we got that toward the end. No bueno no flavor to it. I ordered a steak it was nasty dry and small. I was like this aint no rib eye. There was no steak sauce. Oh and the smoked chicken was so overcooked it was very dry I think it was old ugh. Well at least we had a nice time with the family. Thats all that matters."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  Simple, no frills menu with reasonable prices, but food is quality and cooked perfectly.  Friendly, prompt wait staff.  Recommended for breakfast!"}
{"text":"My husband had been here before & loved the apple pie ala mode.  It had been served hot with the ice cream lusciously  melting onto it. This time our experience was quite different. We had ordered black & bleu burgers with onion rings. The onion rings were quite good, burger was fine. The bun was mediocre & it was served with packets of mayo. Didn't see that coming. The thing is the service was so slow. It took forever to just get the burgers. Then it took our server 20 minutes to clear & get our pie order. I get it takes awhile to cook the pie but we heard the pie was at the pass 10 minutes before it was served to us, cold. We didn't even eat it but got the bill & left. The service was inexcusable. We are done with Bill Johnson & his big apples."}
{"text":"The service here was good, but the food was bad.  All of our food came out cool to the touch.  We ordered the pick your own combo and the meat all came lumped together and was full of fat.  Not too sure if we'll be back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Relatively good place to eat. Friendly with good service. The price for the all-you-can-eat beef ribs was only 15$. The clam chowder was okay, beans were decent, sweet potato fries were not bad either. The beef ribs had parts that were over cooked but since it's all you can eat ask for as many beef ribs as you want for the parts that are not overcooked!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Waitress was happy and upbeat. Steady flow of customers and everyone looks happy with their meal. So an overall excellent experience. Happy we stopped in!"}
{"text":"Bill Johnson's has been out family's go-to restaurant since it opened in this location. Here's the thing. Since their family has been having their feud, the food has taken a dive. Prices have gone up, long time menu items have been eliminated, and the experience has been changed. Lots of the old timers keeping this location alive were chased off, and regulars like me no longer felt welcome. Waitresses even complained to me about the negative working conditions that corporate was implementing. They tried so hard to attract a hip crowd that they lost the tried and true. This location is closed, and probably will always be. I hear the CEO granddaughter got chased out by the board-maybe this will be the shot in the arm they need to restore their quality and continue their kitschy, Arizona image."}
{"text":"I'm not to sure what the big deal is about this place.  I was staying at the HGI up the street and so I moseyed into this place for some barbecue.  I decided to have some ribs and beer so I rolled up my sleeves and got to work.  Unfortunately, that's what the ribs were... work.  They ribs were no where near fall-off-the-bone.  The beer was perfectly cold but the ribs were forgettable.  I knew I should have ordered the chicken fried chicken.  Ah, well.  Next time."}
{"text":"Third time here. Not as good as before. Salmon not tasty, salad over loaded with dressing. Wait staff good. Restaurant clean."}
{"text":"5 stars for service...our waiter on a slow Tuesday afternoon, right after the lunch rush, was a funny guy and pretty good at his job. As well, my friend and I never wanted for refills on our Dr. Pepper, which is the one true way to my heart at any restaurant.  3 stars for the food, which frankly, wasn't all that great but that may have been due to what I ordered more than anything else (Blue Moon burger). To be honest, I've had better cheeseburgers from Denny's (see my review, LOL) but I guess that isn't the draw here...my friend's beef brisket sandwich looked and smelled delicious and there's plenty more  items on the menu to choose from next time.  Of course, I must reiterate that since there isn't much in the way of decent dining in the neighborhood my friend and I work in (she about 5 blocks west, myself about 3), this place will definitely get a second chance not too long from now."}
{"text":"the food here is pretty good especilly the pulled pork bbq sandwich! but the service wasnt very great. took over 30mins to just get a waitress to even come over to say hi and ask us what we want to drink. then took over an hour and a half for our food to even come outc. when there was maybe 15 other people in the restaurant. i will never come back to thi sone again. we left very unhappy and no one seemed to care there.  i will go to the other one, they have great service there"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant when I was a kid. Sad to hear they are closing after all these years.   5 stars for the memories."}
{"text":"I have no idea what just happened. I came here for dinner and the place was vacant, with like one other party at any given time in here.  I'm not sure if it's because it's sort of in the hood, or because it's just not that good.  I've never been to a Bill Johnson's, but it seemed like a nice place all this time.  There's a few different locations throughout the valley, and I've never heard a bad thing about them before. They seem like a nice family style restaurant and I came here with a friend tonight for dinner for the first time.  I can't put my finger on it, but I think it was the food that didn't impress me. They seem to be a family style steak and potatoes type place, but the food wasn't all that good and it seemed a bit pricy. I think you get huge portions, but it wasn't all that good.  I went with the bbq sandwich with a baked potato.  It was okay, but seemed like it was cut up into tiny cubes with bbq sauce over it. It really didn't have much flavor to it either. I just wasn't all that impressed. I think years ago it used to be the best place ever, from what I heard, but I was kind of disappointed overall with the food and the high prices  mediocre food."}
{"text":"Went here a couple weeks ago while I was in Arizona. This place isn't located far from the Phoenix Airport so it was the breakfast spot of choice after arriving in the morning.  The place wasn't lit very much at all. I don't know if it was supposed to be romantic or if it was supposed to be scary (as they had Halloween decorations up too).   Our party was sat at a table near the entrance. It seemed like everyone else eating there was off to the right in another section of the restaurant. We were thinking that maybe the \"regulars\" have a different place to sit?  It didn't really matter though as the food was good. My uncle, his friend, and I all had the Pig Out Breakfast - which included eggs, pancackes, bacon, sausage, and ham.   I won't be surprised if I go here again next year."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of coming here on a Friday night. A combination of a very obnoxious and intentionally loud party (these people thought they were in a bar), a baby that kept kicking the back of my wife's chair and the restrictions with the Entertainment Book coupon were enough for me to only give this place two stars!! I really liked the restaurants interior, though...Kind of had an \"Old Western Arizona\" feel to it with original relics and sawdust on the floor...Let me put it to you like this, Fess Parker would have loved to eat here. As for the food, I think the salad croutons are homemade, the potato skins were typical and the ranch dressing was among the best I've had!! I do want to know, however, if the waitresses are carrying real guns (not joking) in those holsters. I ask cos most of them had vintage, replica looking 44 caliber/38 specials, but this one waitress straight up had what looked like a Glock 23...I guess the service is always good, right? :-) Ok, so the \"buy one, get one free\" Entertainment coupon works like this: It's only good up for up to $12 and you MUST purchase two sodas. We had the \"choose your own\" 3 BBQ meat platters and was very unimpressed. It was as if they didn't spend any time on peparing the meats. Also, I'm not sure what it was, but you know when you get a piece of meat stuck in your back teeth for a day and by the end of the day it ferments and the smell stops you in your tracks?...Yeah, well, that is exactly how the mashed potatoes tasted, even down to the pungent aftertaste. Won't go back. Save your appetite for somewhere else. Update: this place has since gone out of business."}
{"text":"crystal, manager and lisa/jennifer are awesome!  thursday nights are $12 all you can eat ribs and it's a great deal!  their peach iced tea and apple pie are yummy!"}
{"text":"To all: Dis place is not the same anymore dey changed der menus 2 yrs ago & I have never went bak since. Miss the old Bill Johnson's. It's funny & its closed down now!"}
{"text":"I loved this place as a kid.  I just like it now.  Very kid friendly (as I remember) and the portions and the food are pretty good."}
{"text":"I can't even tell you how much I love @BillJohnsonsAZ!  I have been going there since I was knee-high to a grasshopper, and they have never disappointed me.  Pulled pork, beef brisket, and hot links, is the perfect combination, to get a taste of everything that is wonderful about Big Apple.  The atmosphere alone would keep me coming back, time and again; sawdust on the floor, western decor (including miniature covered wagon lamps), and the waiters and waitresses are all packing heat, in the form of a .44 on their hips.  Used to be they could draw the guns, but now they're bolted to the holster. Sad reflection on the regression our society has gone through, that a prop must be secured \"for the public safety\".  They have a delicious apple pie dessert, that is properly served with american cheese. I personally prefer it with a scoop of vanilla.  And don't think they're only about lunch or dinner; they have a great breakfast menu. They also have M-F 6-11 AM specials, including a homemade cinnamon roll.  I have been to Big Apple more times than I can count, and I will return again.  And again."}
{"text":"Usually we go to Denny's for breakfast...what a mistake to come to Bill Johnson's. In fact, what the heck has happened to Bill Johnson's??? When did it go so downhill?  Located next to Lowe's on the west side of Dysart.  Greasy, nasty bland breakfast (I don't even want to see who was cooking my food!). Sticky table, accented with lots of crumbs on the table and booth. Appetizing!  Service was very slow and the Food Server was very immature (I wonder if he realizes that his TIPS are based on his service??!) Please feel free to pick up the dirty dishes ANYTIME before dropping off the check.   Do you want a refill for your coffee? Forget it, not here...never saw anyone walking around with a coffee pot.  Why is the parking lot always full? Who is eating here and why?  You'd be better off eating a processed breakfast sandwich from a gas station than dine here..."}
{"text":"Heard alot of bad stuff about this place.  We stopped in during happy hour.  No one was there.  Great service, sampler platter was good.  No complaints.  $1 Pabst, how can you go wrong."}
{"text":"When I was a wee little chit I really enjoyed the myth of the cowboy. Seeing how I'm a native of Arizona, there were plenty of places that satisfied my preoccupation with fried rattlesnake and buffalo burgers, ghost towns and hole in the wall saloons where I'd feel like a hot shit sitting down for a sarsaparilla.   One of my favorite places to frequent as a kid was Bill Johnson's Big Apple, where there was sawdust on the floor, the wait staff carried pistols and sported Texas-sized big hair, and the whole rustic feel piqued my excitement.  I recently returned to this place after a 15 year hiatus, once for breakfast and once for a Father's Day lunch, and I was sorely disappointed that it no longer held the same mystique. It's really not the food or the atmosphere that has changed. It's the same old place it's always been, it's just that my expectations that have risen over the years. I've had some truly superior barbeque since I was a kiddo, and Bill Johnson's no longer measures up.  Breakfast is simple, with a variety of hearty combos. The hash browns were a disappointment, soggy, oily potatoes with no other flavor. The biscuits were mediocre and extremely thick, more like fresh hard tack than a fluffy treat. Eggs, fried breakfast meat and chicken fried steak are difficult to screw up, so that all came out fine. Not exemplary, but perfectly acceptable.   At lunch my father, two sisters and I had five different barbequed meats between us and a steak, with a bunch of sides to share and sample. All of the meat aside from the steak had a smoky flavor that wasn't too vinegary or sweet, as some barbeque sauces tend to be. The pulled pork and beef brisket were delicious, but had huge chunks of fat floating around in them that repulsed my gristle-hating taste buds with their texture, so I had to be vigilant. There was nothing extraordinary about the steak or the pork sausage, and the chopped pork sandwich was a bit on the dry side.   Side dish wise, I was very disappointed. The coleslaw was terrible, swimming in mayonnaise with no hint of any other flavor. The chicken noodle soup was decent, with doughy noodles, but also was lacking in flavor and contained very little chicken. The barbequed beans tasted nothing like their exemplary meat counterpart. However, the chili was quite good, with cheddar cheese, onions, green peppers, pinto beans and plenty of meat. There was not much spiciness to it, but the flavor was great. Or I was just exceptionally hungry.   For dessert we had their deep dish apple pie, which tasted the same as it would have from the freezer at my local grocer.   I was mildly disappointed by the service each time I went. The wait staff were slow and terse, and at one point insulting. My littlest sister is adopted and the woman straight out asked, \"Oh, you're just visiting these good folks, aren't you?\" At which point my jaw dropped, she gave the woman a quizzical look and said, \"No, I live with them.\" That's down right rude to me, but seeing how it was Father's Day we kept on smiling and munching on home cooking.  I'm not sure if I'd return again based on the overall experience, but I know I'll always have fond memories of it from childhood."}
{"text":"An old favorite that can still deliver ok value, though it hasn't kept up with the times, nor has it retained all of its old-school flavor.  I remember coming here as a small child and being stunned by the assorted Western crapstuffs nailed to the walls and suspended from the ceilings, the sawdust on the floor and the shapely waitresses with big irons on their hips and cowgirl shirts that were cut to fit. The food was never bad, but the food was never really the point.  Now, a lot of the former flair seems to have diminished. They don't do radio broadcasts from here anymore. The sawdust has been replaced with sparse wood shavings. A lot of the memorabilia seems to have been raided. And the waitresses have a shape, but it's mainly round these days. So now you have a sort of lack-luster menu of various burgers, steaks, chops, and ribs, none of which really stand out, and service tends to be kinda slow.  I would take out-of-towners here to give them a hokey \"Arizona\" experience with no promises about the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I've gone here four or five times the past few months, the food is always overpriced and not that great. The one thing I do like about this place is the lemonade, other than that I can do without the poor service and hearing the managers shout at the workers. Definitely not going back, I suggest you don't go either."}
{"text":"Since the last review of the place took place in March of 2009 it seems they have improved a bunch.  Not sure if its new management or maybe its a change of style but I have eaten here many times and the food has been great.  We have had some of the friendliest servers in the valley here. The last time we went to Bill Johnsons our waitress went out of her way to make sure we had everything hot fresh and timely.    Whats cool is every night they have a dinner special.  They have one called the BBQ blowout it has Beef Ribs, Pork Ribs, Chicken, a sausage, rolls a salad and beans all for 9.99.  That's a great deal.  They also have really nice prime rib and beef rib specials.    The BBQ is pretty good.  Its pretty similar to what you would find at a chain BBQ place.  I recommend getting BBQ only on the special because then its more worth the money.  They have really good steaks and burgers, and the chicken is outstanding.  Stick with chicken and you wont be disappointed.    A little warning they do have sawdust on the floor as it is part of their theme.    Overall I like this Bill Johnsons its not a bad meal and for the money you cant lose."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by here last week for a quick bite to eat. It was happy hour so we ordered a zucchini appetizer half off. My boyfriend ordered some type of mushroom cheeseburger and I ordered one with BBQ sauce on mine. The burgers were HUGE! They reminded me of something Scooby Doo and Shaggy would eat. I even tried crushing my burger to shrink it down but no luck. While the burger was gigantic it tasted pretty bland, lacking flavor.   Our waitress (don't remember her name unfortunately) was very nice. Our drinks were kept full and she was friendly and engaged us in conversation. She instantly let us know it was happy hour and suggested some appetizers. She was also ready to answer any questions we had about our meal.   Everything was going great until near the end of our  meal we noticed flies in the restaurant. They were trying to land on our food and I instantly lost my appetite. I have had my food attacked by flies when sitting outdoors but never inside an establishment. This was a huge turn off for my boyfriend and I so until this issue is corrected I do not plan on coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Took family for breakfast. Good food at reasonable prices great service minor wait to be seated. Overall a great experience every time we visit this place"}
{"text":"We first came to Phoenix for the weekend, we came across Bill Johnson's BBQ place and couldn't get enough of it.  We've since bought his BBQ sauce many a times while visiting the area.    Today we decided to try breakfast, so we stopped in and found the place almost empty.  I got a very hearty breakfast, with biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs and hash browns.  Overall, a good meal, and great service.  Very quaint western theme place.  Feels very nostalgic!"}
{"text":"Like everything else on Van Buren, Bill Johnson's is cheap & easy.  The wait staff is kind and helpful.  Very attentive as they knock their gun holsters against your table as they turn around.  The food is marginal but you get a lot and it doesn't cost much.  Let's just say, you could do worse on Van Buren.  We went for their dinner special.  An appetizer of onion rings and fried zucchini, two dinner plates, and a dessert for $21.99.  Smokin deal and the quality matched the price.  I ordered a three meat combo plate.  I'm not sure what happened to the other meat but there was a ton of pulled pork and a sausage that was split in half crammed on my plate flanked by a baked potato, corn on the cob, and a giant roll.  It was a huge meal.  The pork was dry but got better when I put the bbq sauce on it.  The sausage was great and had a bit of spice to it.  The potato tasted like a baked potato so no complaints there.  The corn was sweet and really good.  The roll was just okay - a little stale on the outside.  Loved the zucchini appetizer too!  As far as the apple pie that came for dessert - it is sitting in our fridge.  There is no way we could eat it.  I'd like to try this place for breakfast but ultimately, I probably wouldn't go back for dinner.  It was okay but just not enough attention paid to the preparation of the food.  Love the sign outside though - a true Phx icon!"}
{"text":"01/23/2015 Update: Oh no!!! The Big Apple is closing to make room for parking for Gateway Community College. Sounds like a bad parody of an old Joni Mitchell song, but I'm afraid it's true. Fortunately, we have a two year window before it closes for good. First Monte's, now Bill Johnson's. Aargh!!!    I love Bill Johnson's Big Apple. The home of the best business street sign in all of Phoenix. Worth a trip by itself. And the food isn't bad either. A perfect spot to bring your winter visitors from the Midwest.  It's clear that this restaurant, which has been a Phoenix staple since the mid-1950's, is getting a little long in the tooth. A framed review on the way to the restroom says it all. Voted Best BBQ by the Arizona Republic - in 1991. I do like their BBQ sauce. It's sold in grocery stores, so apparently a lot of other folks like it as well. Not your BBQ of choice, however, if you like your BBQ trendy.   I remember when servers at Bill Johnson's always wore holsters (actually kind of miss them) and there was sawdust spread on the floor (don't miss that at all). In many respects, however, the rest of the restaurant is frozen in time. And you know what? I don't mind a bit. I love it!   I've always been partial to their breakfast, which is served until 11:00 a.m. Also very kid friendly (ask for a balloon), with a simple and good kids menu (photo attached). At other times of day, they have a great selection of reasonably priced burgers. Served somewhere else you'd consider them to be gourmet. I like the option, stated on the menu so you don't have to negotiate, to change out the hamburger for grilled chicken at no extra cost.   Some Big Apple locations have closed in recent years, so I'm making a point to support this one. Hope you do too. It's part of Phoenix history."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite places to eat. The food is incredibly.  Drinks are good, and fairly priced. Happy hour weekdays till 6p.m.   I go here at least once a week, sometimes two or three times a week. And I plan to keep coming"}
{"text":"Disgusting, cold food was sent back to the kitchen. They reheated the same food and sent it back out...nothing says loving like twice fried sweet potato fries...seriously a disaster."}
{"text":"Been here many times before but this was the first since they had the bankruptcy issues and I will never go again.   The waitress Kim was very rude and got the orders wrong 3 times even though we ordered the daily specials. Then when it was time to pay the bill she brought us a bill which every item was the wrong amount. For example their were 5 of us and she was charging for 9 drinks etc...  Pointed this out and she got all angry. Then came and picked up the tip before we left and let out a loud sigh and muttered cheapskates. Service was awful and food was very dry/cold so I thought 15% was generous but apparently she doesn't think so...."}
{"text":"This was a tossup between 3 or 4 stars, but since I go here every time I'm back home in Arizona, they won the toss. This isn't what it was in its glory days, but the barbequed pig still totally rocks, and who can resist the deep dish apple pie? It's a fun place to eat and I've never had bad service here. So much of Phoenix is impermanent that it is a pleasure to see a worthwhile restaurant beat the odds."}
{"text":"I went here with 2 friends tonight for a leisurely dinner. It was the first time for all of us at this location, and the first time I've ever been to a Bill Johnson's. Two of us chose the Sirloin and Hand Breaded Chicken Fingers, and our other friend chose the Nate's Top Sirloin. They were all very good, as were the sides that we had: Steak Fries, Green Chili Macaroni and Cheese, and Green Beans with Ham. We even indulged in some desserts, and they were all great and very generous portions. Two of us loved the Rock Springs Bourbon Pecan Pie, and the other went with the Chocolate Brownie Skillet.   Chris was our waitress, and she made the whole experience a very fun and enjoyable time. She's so outgoing and friendly.  It's a shame that Kent, the manager who was on duty tonight, put a downer on our experience. Seems he doesn't know how to treat his waitstaff, and spent a lot of time firing orders at Chris and running her ragged. By the time we left, I couldn't be bothered to even acknowledge his presence. If Bill Johnson's is going to make a comeback, they need to greatly improve on who they have manage the place.  In spite of his sour vibe, we will be going back."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast. We were sat pretty quickly but no one came to our table for about 10 minutes. Apparently no one was sure who's section we were in. The food was ok, definitely nothing to get excited about. I had to ask for a glass of water 4 times before they brought it.  We have had a decent dinner there before and may go back for that sometime but for breakfast there are much better places in town."}
{"text":"Wow! sad to hear they're closing. Having just moved to AZ a few short months ago, I happened upon this great western looking place. I love the old west and history, and I love a good steak. I looked forward to a day off so I can try this place.   It wasn't on a day off, but I was in the area and figured I'd go ahead and try it. I was impressed with the speed of service and the quality of the food. The price point was spot on for the portions you receive. Normally I would write a lengthy commentary about my experience, however, since it appears they're closed, suffice to say... This is/was a great nostalgic western BBQ that I am honored to have been a guest of. It is with a heavy heart that I bid Big Apple, so long.  Thank you for a great first/last time experience."}
{"text":"Upon our overnight stay at Econolodge a few blocks down, the live lit sign along side of the street attracted me to try this restaurant.  I remember the menu vaguely, however did not forget the amazing breakfast special the other half and I ordered.  $6 for a plate of thick cut bacon, 2 eggs made your way, hash browns, and toast (white/wheat/rye, etc.)  Customer service was great, the hostess and waitress made us feel very comfortable!"}
{"text":"I have been on Phoenix for over 30 years.  I always loved Bill Johnson's. In the last few years they have gone to hell in a hand basket.    Their beef ribs were very large with huge chunks of meet on them.  Tender and full of flavor,.  They have been cutting back and back.   I went last night for ribs.  They were burned black and hard, no flavor,   I mentioned that the entire menu has no lighter fare on it.  The new menu still does  The waitresses are not carrying 67 guns,  (Too expensive) not.  The condiments have disappeared from the tables,  I I am sure the veges are from cans.    They surely need a make over.  Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.  Otherwise go chew and old retread!"}
{"text":"It is a museum that serve wonderful food.  It is  a meat lover heaven and I ordered a 16 OZ prime rib and my buddy ordered triple BBQ plate and they are both as good as it gets.  The servers were dressed in old western with a gun in their pocket so you boys and girls better not behave accordingly.  Any place like this in major cities will be expensive and it is Arizona pricing that offered great slab of meat that will satisfy any hungry bear's appetite.  Decors are very dated but that is the theme with a true historical background.  Since Main street is a major thoroughfare, the restaurant had stood the test of time just like an old fashion NYC deli."}
{"text":"It's cute, quirky, and a tradition, but neither the food nor the service is very good.  In a place like this, I expect at least to have a coffee warm up at decent intervals, but even that didn't happen.    The omelettes were dessicated and bland.  The gravy also was bland and looked and tasted like something from a bag.  The biscuits seemed old and lifeless.  The pancakes were fine, but nothing special.  I will say the hash browns were very good--just the right combo of moist with a nice crisp (but not char) on top."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years, and love it, BUT I JUST READ THEY'RE CLOSING within the next 2 years to make room for a community college parking lot! Please don't close!!! It was sad enough when the other locations went down. This place is part of Phoenix history. So sad to see it go.  That being said, as far as the food and service - I was in Phoenix in December and took my entire family there before a concert. Excellent food, friendly staff. Food was a little slow coming out, but there were 10 of us, and besides, we enjoyed the experience. I had awesome BBQ ribs, and they were much better than I even remembered. The whole group enjoyed heir meals. It's a fun place with character, and the food is great.   Well, sad to see it go. So long, Phoenix landmark. Make way for the parking lot. Maybe you'll get another Jack in the Box on the corner. Yech."}
{"text":"I remember eating there with my Grandmother and 2 aunts. I was fairly young maybe 4 or 5. As an adult I continued going for my beloved sandwich called the Pig, so good.  Very sorry to see them close"}
{"text":"This place is bad. I mean really bad. It's the only time I have ever had buyers remorse for a meal and it was the first and last time I chose to ignore yelp reviews and give a poorly rated place a try.  The food was gross. The burger was average and the \"Jack Daniels Sauce\" was a luke-warm, globby, gelatinous, bitter-tasting atrocity served in a cup on the side.  I don't think the french fries were even fried. I'm positive that they were bagged oven fries like the kind you get at the grocery store.   There service was terrible. The waitress didn't seem to care about her job at all. She was bland and uninterested and slow as hell. She didn't even clear old dishes. The whole time I had a collection of cups at the side of my table from her not taking them away after drink refills.   The place is decorated with awful and hokey cowboy/indian stuff... complete with the staff wearing holstered toy pistols. Also it seems like it's falling apart and bathroom was gross.   Please do yourself a favor and drive past this place. You can drive 100 feet down the road to black bear diner and get the same foods 10x better for the same price."}
{"text":"I had a great memory with Bill Johnson Big Apple when I lived in North Phoenix. My wife and I went to Big Apple restaurant on 19th Ave. by Bell Rd. We had such wonderful experience every time we went there foods were outstanding with great service and these ladies with guns, Such a great times now lost. But I never understand why such a great restaurant has to close."}
{"text":"First time visit to Bill Johnson's. Fun decor with nostalgic Western theme. Ordered the Stampede Sampler (Sliced Beef Brisket, BBQ Pork Ribs and BBQ Pulled Pork) and was really disappointed. Ribs were dry and tasted old like a left over warmed up in the toaster oven. The Sliced Beef Brisket was more like busted pieces of a dry bad pot roast. The Pulled Pork was bland. No smokey flavor in any of the pieces. Again more like leftovers. The highlight were the sides. Baked Beans, great flavor and a little tang. Jalapeño Mac n' Cheese, creamy with just the right bite. The surprise...Sonoran Mashed Potatoes, cream cheese and chives. Delicious!  The service was spot on from the host to my server. Great service."}
{"text":"Chicken fried steak and a bloody mary are a wonderful start to the day, especially when you may kind of sort of drank just a little too much the night before. Another thing that helps to numb the throbbing of that situation, which I assure you I hardly ever encounter, is the casual atmosphere. I mean, there are wood chips on the floor, so you can't contribute more to the mess. Right?   All kidding aside, Bill Johnson's Big Apple is a solid stand-by when we want something filling and unpretentious. Nothing will really invoke an awakening here, but this isn't church (even though you may be privy to a Sunday sermon...but those guys are really harmless and who couldn't use a little God with their breakfast?)"}
{"text":"\"Interesting\" is probably the best word I can think of to describe Bill Johnson's Big Apple.  This restaurant is located in an oh-so-charming part of town with even lovelier people.  The restaurant has a cheesy cowboy theme with sawdust on the floor and gun toting waitresses.  The food is pretty cheap.  We got the 21.99 meal for two which came with an onion ring and fried zucchini app, two entrees, and a pie for dessert.  The onion rings were delicious, and super crunchy, just the way I like them.  I don't like zucchini, so I didn't have any.  For my entree, I got the bacon wrapped filet, and it was funny.  It was certainly not a filet and I think the \"bacon\" was actually just a thin strip of steak wrapped around steak.  The steak was cooked exactly the way I wanted it, but unfortunately, it was a poor cut of meat that resulted in a pretty tough steak.  The corn on the cob I had was good and the mashed potatoes and gravy were decent.  The pie we took home and ate later, and it was pretty good.  Don't come here expecting 5 star food, because that is only setting yourself up for failure.  It's cheap food at cheap prices and it's not that bad.  I enjoyed my experience, and I could possibly go back at some point in the distant future."}
{"text":"Imagine if you will a big, busy, hokey, old fashioned western-themed family restaurant sitting in the middle of a drab, urban area which has seen nothing but decline over the past few decades.  This pretty much describes the \"original\" Bill Johnson's restaurant, which continues to thrive after 50 years on a still very depressed/depressing stretch of Van Buren St.   The menu offers a large selection of breakfast, burger, steak, and BBQ dishes.  I passed on the opportunity to overstuff myself with their pound of onion rings and all-you-can-eat-ribs, instead trying the 4-meat combo.  Bill Johnson's claims to be \"famous\" for their BBQ - I'm not sure that I'd place their food among the top BBQ I've ever tried, but what I had was more than satisfying. Their signature deep dish apple pie also made for a good dessert. They offer discounts on certain menu items if you dine before or after their \"peak\" dinner hours of 6 PM to 9 PM.  I was somewhat delighted to find that much of the waitstaff seemed to fit in well with the quirky, old fashioned atmosphere of this place - they were entertaining folk, but my dining companion was somewhat bothered by the fact that all the staff seemed to be carrying pistols (I tried to reassure that the guns were probably fake). I believe the other Bill Johnson locations are pretty similar in atmosphere to the Van Buren location, but my Phoenix friends recommend this \"original\" location for the most authentic experience.  Just don't linger too long in the parking lot after your meal or you may find yourself being harrassed by a raggedy prostitute or street person."}
