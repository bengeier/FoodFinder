{"text":"Love this place. Friendly service great food. Try breakfast too. The Chilequiles are my favorite"}
{"text":"I used to come here often and was craving Mexican food and made a trip here instead of Robertos(what a mistake that was).  I got the chile relleno. It was the most disgusting relleno I've ever laid eyes on. It looked like it was made that morning or the day before and then popped in a microwave for 5 minutes. It felt like rubber, and the bottom of it was completely saturated in grease. I can't even put into words how disgusting this meal was. I called the waitress over and showed her, she apologized and acknowledged that it was gross and took it. A different waitress comes back with my food.. Long story short she said it was right and how it's supposed to be and that I'm wrong. And admitted they use a microwave. I don't know what happened to them but that was the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Can't figure out which was worse... the customer service or the overpriced crap microwaved food. Those girls you have in the front are ruining your business."}
{"text":"Good prices! Authentic mexican food! We really like the salsa that we ordered some to go. The portions are also the right size."}
{"text":"Affordable and authentic--it's an A in my book! Recently moved here and I have only tried don Roberto's (yuck). Thankfully I tried this joint cause I'm sure gonna come back. Ordered to go my usual which I devoured cause it was tasty and juicy but I wish they would have given me some salsa and chips while I waited aprox. 15 min for my order..guess I've been spoiled with my other to go Mexican joints in Cali. Thus the -1 star!"}
{"text":"My Menudo favorite!  Sometimes get my order wrong but I pick up food once a week. Good choice for the closest thing to home made mexican fast food.  Pretty good service too"}
{"text":"Service is always great and I've never had a bad meal. If I'm there for breakfast I get the red chilaquiles and they're the best I've had in Vegas. Their salsa and horchata are really good too."}
{"text":"Went to this place on impulse after the dog park.  We didn't know what to expect but were pleasantly surprised.  We got our food to go and didn't have to wait long.  We got the enchiladas and a wet asada burrito.  Our food was delicious and correct so we will definitely be going back. Best Mexican food I've had in Vegas and not as Americanized like other spots."}
{"text":"This place is not only disgusting but the staff is incredible rude! While I was having dinner here one of the young ladies working told a customer and he's 85 year old mom couldn't not sit in the booth they were sitting! She made the poor old lady get up just because it was a booth for three people or more?! What does it matter?!! They were paying customer they should be allowed to sit anywhere. Last time I ever come in!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Consistently good food, excellent service. 

We go here several times a month at least and have not been disappointed. 

Their salsa is good, not too spicy but not bland either. 

Favorite menu items include:

Chimichanga

Tamales

Chile Rellano Burrito

Veggie Burrito

Any of the above smother in the their green sauce.

Carne asada tacos are delicious as well. 

Definitely a bit of a hole in the wall but if you like Mexican food you will not be disappointed. The prices are extremely reasonable as well."}
{"text":"The food here at Tony's is really good and the staff are always nice. The wait to get food takes awhile which is kind of surprising since Tony's isn't ever terribly busy. I've been going to Tony's for years and the food is consistently delicious."}
{"text":"I had to come back the second time which was the next day. Nice and cheap and tasty too. If there's a crowd try it. This place is good. If you don't like it, My feelings wont be hurt."}
{"text":"I love this place! The beef tongue tacos and carne asada tacos are sooo good!! And so cheap!!"}
{"text":"I order a torta of carnitas and it was not what I expected. The tacos are good."}
{"text":"Best mexican food Ive found!!!!! If I didnt know better I'd swear my mom was in the kitchen!!!!! Their menudo is the best in town!!"}
{"text":"First time here food good service good the pork was awesome found a hidden gem must try"}
{"text":"Trying something new and couldn't believe how good the food and service is. Family oriented business and recommend this place to everyone. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Great service!   Best chips and salsa combo, salsa is perfect not to spicy..  I really like their carne asada wet burrito so GOOD!   The chimichanga is the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"They have really good food but their portions are small for a 10 dollar plate and waitresses don't check on tables unless is to pick up their hardly earned tips, they have good flan!"}
{"text":"Personally love the chilaquiles!! That's basically all I get every single time, the one time I didn't I got the French toast and it was very good!"}
{"text":"I eat here for breakfast regularly.  The place is small and homey and the service friendly.  The breakfast is wonderful!  There are other restaurants with the same name, I wonder if some of the bad reviews are actually not about the restaurant on Craig by Food 4 Less."}
{"text":"Here for the first time with co workers. Everyone loved what they ordered including taco and burrito lunch specials at 6.99.  The beans and rice were surprisingly good.  There were clear plates all around. Service was a little slow to start but after drinks came out, orders were taken quickly and brought out quickly.  The server was very polite. It was busy around lunch time like 12ish.  We're definitely going back.  Small note: $.50 service charge for card transactions under $10."}
{"text":"I was visiting in LV and saw the 5 star ratings here, so had to try it as it was close by.  It was very clean and a friendly staff.  I can't give it 5 stars tho'.... the food was pretty good, the salsa was great, and I will probably go back whenever I get back to LV.  I'd recommend it if you're in the area, but wouldn't make a trip across LV for it."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. Super good food and the staff is really nice. I'm never disappointed in my food always taste so delicious. I recommend this place for anyone looking for affordable Mexican food."}
{"text":"The food  there is bland except for the salsa, to salty & very spicy.  I usually like the salsa from mexican restaurants but this was to much.  Husband & I had the shrimp cocktails, $12.50 Each! Sorry they were good but not that good. Had chicken burrito, and 3 soft mini tacos, 2 iced teas. We had No alchol. over $41! the service is good there,but  it is not a place to go if you are on a budget or have a family trying to save some money. We will stick with Roberto's."}
{"text":"This is our place for Sunday breakfast..the prices are right, great staff, great food and EXCELLENT michelada'. I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time a few weeks ago with my family based on yelp reviews. Service was ok, food was so-so... Then it became horrible after I found hair in my chicken taquitos! Killed my appetite after seeing that! They took it off our tab but that'll be the first & last time there for us! :("}
{"text":"While my Menudo cools a bit, let me start by saying that this is a neat and pretty little restaurant. Clean too!

The service is friendly and professional from the start and warm. They truly run a restaurant business here and love what they do.

I ordered the chips and guacamole and it was tasty and well seasoned. I came in on a Sunday, so I ordered the Menudo. Which is perfect to me, hot and spicy good. I hope you come and try them out.

Restaurants such as this make leaving North Las Vegas for Downtown hard. We got good places to eat and play right here."}
{"text":"I took my family to lunch on this past Sunday. We did not order anything special. Although we where seated before the lunch crowd came in we where last to be served. The prices where a little much for what we got. My wife and have been to this location a few times and where pleased with both the service and food. This is the only reason I gave two stars in place of one. We will never return."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Before my visit, I was planning for this to be a replacement of the neighborhood Roberto's, but this place is definitely a step up. 

This is what we had;
Chips and Salsa: I wasn't expecting them to serve complimentary chips and salsa, but they did. I think this is a very nice touch, which really distinguishes this place from Roberto's. The chips were made in house, and the salsa got spicy after you stopped eating. Make sure to have your drink topped off before you dive in.

Combination (with beans and cheese) shredded beef chimichanga covered in hot sauce and cheese ($11): I like shredded beef over carne asada on my chimichangas because the beef is typically more tender which makes the burrito easier to eat. I loved how soft and melt-in-your mouth the beef in this burrito was. It also had beans in there, which I wasn't expecting but wasn't complaining about. The ONLY issues I had were that the size was pretty small, and the fried tortilla covering wasn't as crispy as other I've had. 
*The beans and rice were really awesome. The rice was light and fluffy, and the beans had really good flavor, but could have used a little topping of cheese.

Carne Asada Quesadilla ($6): Larger than we expected, and there was no issue finding carne asada- it was STUFFED with meat. Jason said it was good.

Carne Asada Tacos ($1.29 each): Jason was also impressed with these. He was expecting the tacos to come topped with the onion and cilantro it was pictured in the menu with, but it came out plain. The server was happy to bring out the toppings he requested though. 

I hate that I've been comparing this to Roberto's during the entire review, but it's the quality of food & service I was expecting. This was obviously not the case for several reasons:
1. Service was good, and everyone spoke English. The last 2 times we went to R's Jason got a regular burrito (with guacamole, which he hates) instead of the breakfast burrito he ordered. Needless to say, I thought my chimichanga days were numbered.
2. This is a place you'd actually want to sit down and eat.
3. Servers were around to top off drinks, and get you everything you need to enjoy your meal.
4. Chips are served when you dine in.
5. Quality of food was definitely a step up. 

TRY IT!"}
{"text":"Great place. Staff is friendly and the food is very good. The chips and salsa are great as well."}
{"text":"We always get take out! Their chicken street tacos are great! Love the green sauce. The chips and salsa are ok."}
{"text":"Really, no stars! I ordered a chimichanga for pick up close to closing. I mentioned I would like sour cream and guacamole as well. I expected a possible charge for sc and guacamole, then again I've other places that already provides it part of the meal. Anywho, I arrive to only having to wait 3-5 min. I lived 5 min. Away, not bad! When I received my meal to go, of course I checked  for the guacamole and sour cream to no avail. I politely inquired of absence of side condiments. This is where it gets interesting. I had already checked the receipt and it was charges for .99 twice ( guacamole and sc) the cashier stated it was inside of the chimi. So I did what anyone else who knows what to do in this situation unless you don't care or know how much you love guacamole and sc! After I cut into it and saw the very minimal amt. of condiments I was charged $2 for, I proceeded to ask for more and I would pay the difference of what they supposedly already given me ( so little, couldn't tell). Granted the prices of 4 oz. containers of guacamole and sc were $1.99 and $1.15 respectively. This is where drew the line... They said they couldn't/wouldn't do it and would have to charge me for the 2 condiments? After minutes of trying to explain the the logic of just giving me what THEY thought was fair amounts extra for what I was WILLING to pay the difference for ($1 for guacamole and $.15 for sour cream) the cashier and waitress both said no can do! Even after she/they went to the back, I guess to confirm, they came back with the same answer. So already knowing I just should've asked for a refund. I made it simple for them and suggested they just back what gave me or trash and make me a fresh 1 with the condiments on the side in its respectful sized containers. (At this point I was damn, I shouldn't let them make me another, for those who know about some food workers/ handlers who are asked to remake something...) plus, too much time had passed with all the back n forth rhetoric and food was getting cold. Well after they refused to make another, even after cashier consulted with someone on the phone about the situation for literally 5 min. Before I ultimately made the right decision and politely asked to don't worry any further and just refund my monies. All $8 and some change which she acted like she was ruluctant to do. After receiving my refund, I simply rode my motorcycle across the parking lot to EL POLLO LOCO. Damn I was wanting a chimi chimi... If you don't know, don't piss of a possible loyal customer (any for that matter!)"}
{"text":"Sooooo bomb. I can eat there everyday. It is one of the best spots in North Town if you ask me, I've had lots of things from their menu, granted I am vegetarian but the food is ridiculously flavorful, affordable, and very filling. The perfect comfort food. Tonys. Boom."}
{"text":"Their Carnitas are to die for!!! I always want to order something else but ALWAYS the Carnitas. 
I do want to try the Carne Asada Fries too!!"}
{"text":"I love me some Tacos...  And as such, I'm always in search for real, authentic flavorful tacos...  I was waiting for my pets to come out of the vets office and decided to do a quick Yelp search for tacos nearby; this is how I found this place.

The place had one customer, not that unusual since it was like 3 PM when I stopped by, but said customer seemed to be enjoying his food.

The cashier/waitress was very nice and took my order promptly.  Not knowing how the food was, I decided to do a \"sampler\" plate, with Carne Asada, Pastor, Buche, Carnitas and Deshebrada, one taco each.

When the plate arrived, the tacos were made with the small tortillas, but they were filled up very nicely...  I enjoyed all of the tacos while drinking an orange Jarritos soda.

The food was so good that I had to order more tacos to go.

I can definitely recommend this place to anyone and you won't regret it..."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of Mexican food- BUT my co-workers suggested that we eat at Tonys. Ordered the Carne asada plate! FANTASTIC! Service was great! Staff was pleasant. Restaurant was clean- service fast!  My friends had the taquitos and wet burrito.. also very tasty! Definitely recommend! Prices very reasonable too!!"}
{"text":"The food here was very good... probably one of the best chili verde burritos I have ever had. The prices are very reasonable as well. The salsa was very good if you like it spicy, because they don't have a mild version. 

They lose two points for their service. It took almost an hour to make two burritos and when they were \"dropped\" on the table by the server,  she asked,  \"You don't need anything else, right?!\" As she was turning to leave...

I shouldn't have to point out to a server that we have no silverware, no napkins, both drinks are empty, there is no salsa left, and you didn't bring the side of sour cream that was ordered. I know... I have high expectations!

The check was prompt, but after 10 minutes of waiting for her to come back to the table and pick my credit card up, I finally left cash on the table so we could leave. 

My advice is to hire new wait staff or make a take out window so the poor servings staff  doesn't impact all of your business."}
{"text":"All i can say is I LOVE TONY\"S i have lived in Las vegas for 11 years and it wasn't till i ate at Tony's did i find authentic mexica food, coming from California where theres alot of authentic to here it was hard to find, but i must say i started at tony's just eating there Menudo but then over the years i have tried several different dishes there, my new favorate is Chilequellis they are delicious, the rd sause is home made and is awsome!!!!! The service there is excellent Eva and the other girls always make you feel welcome. 
There salsa is amazeing, i am big on salsa and i feel u can always tell a restraunt from there salsa and let me tell you extremely awsome!!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend got one of each taco and he loved them lol as for myself I got an Al Pastor Torta and it was bomb! Definitely will be coming here more often"}
{"text":"Well, tried Tony's again...got the wet carnitas burrito, which was actually good...except the last bite that had a small marble-size bone in it...showed to waitress, who isn't the greatest with English and she showed it to another waitress who agreed it looked like a piece of bone... got the bill for the 2 meals we had...when I paid, I said, \"So there's no charge for the bone?\", hoping sarcasm might work. But the waitress was clueless and just laughed and said ,\"No\"....Since there was no manager around, the best I could do was no tip. I guess I could have explained the proper etiquette rules of restaurant customer service, meaning comp the meal and profusely apologize, but it would have gone right over the heads of the two waitresses on duty...So if you like the challenge of maybe choking or breaking a tooth, then Tony's is the place for you...is there a decent Mexican restaurant in NLV for burritos?"}
{"text":"They must have changed stuff around...chips are certainly not made here. Thin...boring.  Also, my carne asada was like a piece of leather. Weird, I used to eat here a lot years ago and it was fantastic. Not this time. #tonysmexicanfood2"}
{"text":"I've given this place two trips. The soup on Sunday's is good pasole or menudo etc, but the prices are robertos or higher and they don't have a salsa bar. You have to pay extra for red or green sauce and they don't have veggies in my opinion you're better off at robertos at this point. Service is also mediocre."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Las Vegas.   I have been coming here for years. I'm never disappointed.  Salsa is  the best.  Prices are low for the amount of food.  Anybody I introduce to Tony's is very appreciative of finding a place that actually good in Mexican food."}
{"text":"Food was delicious not too mention the complimentary chips and salsa with fresh cooked warm chips. I ordered the wet burrito with lengua so good and huge portion not over priced a must go too."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly service. Salsa is yummy I've tried a lot of there food but the chile relleno burrito stands out ! There fries are to die for also:)"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in north Las Vegas! We love Tony's. For over 5 years this has been the Cisneros family spot :)"}
{"text":"Good Food, Horrible Service! I walked in at 6:55 and the place was half full. While I tried to figure out where and what to order no one talked to me, evan though the workers looked at me. I took it upon myself to find a menu and see what they had, then was approached by a worker. I saw a dinner special for $8.99 that came with a drink so I order it. The worker look behind her head at a clock on the wall and said sorry it's 7:02! I told her that I was in the building before 7 but she said sorry, the SYSTEM won't allow her to give me the special anymore. I said fine I would still like the same thing. She told me the meal would be $9.99 and I wouldn't get a drink. To justify the extra cost, she informed me that the plate would have a larger portion of food. As I was waiting for my food, a loud argument started between the worker who took my order and a customer. It was very awkward because the lobby is small and everyone could hear the argument. The customer wanted soft tacos and the worker claimed he didn't mention that during the order. The costumer felt the worker should have asked to verify soft or hard. The worker then began to act very aggressive and unprofessional. The costumers wife looked upset, and the costumer sat down visually frustrated. The worker returned and nearly threw the soft tacos at the costumer. The whole atmosphere was so say the least uncomfortable. I finally got my food and the first thing I noticed was I received no chips and salsa. I asked and was told they were for eat in customers. I then opened my plate and saw the smallest amount of food I have ever seen. I drove home, ate the food and was happy to say the food was great. I was still hungry, but it was good. After this experience, I may or may not ever return to Tonys Mexican Food. If you decide to try for yourself, eat in, because they seem to focus more on them. 

Good Luck,

Robert"}
{"text":"a nice friendly family run place.  Clean and well kept. Service is good.  The food itself was a little on the bland and boring side.  I didn't get the bright flavors I was hoping for.  The salsa's are not bad but they didn't have a spicy option for me."}
{"text":"im from san diego ca we have great Mexican food. tony's restaurant is not good Mexican food. del taco in a pinch is better. everything they prepare has a ton of lettuce and tomato on it. the place is clean and the people are nice. the food is anything but authentic,. portions are small except for the salad on top of everything. there pricey for what you get. we ate everything they brought us, but were not satisfied. I think if they cooked for their customers as they cooked for their family's it would be four stars."}

It was just a simple gesture from the cashier my son was screaming crying she came over with a box of suckers and gave one to my son for him to stop crying. Really sweet !"}
{"text":"I have been a regular here for years and the service I get here has been great. The food comes out fast and hot. The lunch specials come with drinks. The carnitas are some of the best I have ever had. The burritos are very filling and the rice is our families favorite."}
{"text":"I haven't had any bad plates here, their wet burritos are awesome, shrimp cocktails are just right, fried whole fish is finger licking good and ceviche is on point. they serve beer , Spanish and Domestic along with Spanish and regular soft drinks out of the bottle. chips and salsa are always fresh and servers are always very friendly. this place is a hidden jewel on the north side that we north las vegans want all to our selves. ...I guess we can share sometimes..."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were fantastic. I'm very picky about my salsa I like spicy and not watery. I hate when places give you Pico and try to pass it off as salsa. Salsa had great flavor. Really good lunch specials. I ordered the tacos, 2 carne asada and one carnitas. The tortillas come double and I took off the extra one. Rice was fluffy. Cool place to eat if you venture outside the strip. Friendly service"}
{"text":"This was the worse place to order burritos. The lady didn't even care and had no concerns. I can't believe this place has 4 STARZ!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've had since moving to Vegas 8 years ago. The prices are very reasonable. The food takes longer because it is made as you order instead of just being re-heated and scooped on to a plate like a lot of greasy taco shops. This is an instant favorite because this place cooks real Mexican food the right way and isn't afraid to serve spicy salsa."}
{"text":"Love this place. Came in once just to check it out and now we are hooked. We are here at least once a month. My favorite dish is the chimichanga."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken soft tacos and the chicken had no seasoning at all. The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because the beans and rice are good and the green salsa is great."}
{"text":"I work right across the street from where there located (north view dental) , they have the best service. They are always  have are orders correct very clean  place . Good food"}
{"text":"I normally enjoy this spot but today they had a server there her name was Stephanie, I've been going to the jones location for over 6yrs, sometimes 3 times a week the other servers and cooks knew us so well they would say the usual plates for all of you. Today was different Stephanie was training someone new and I have never seen either one of them there. We ordered, our food came out, I asked for a refill on our chips cause we always do, now she said we don't give refills on chips I stated that  we had been coming there for yrs and they have always. She said no we don't but had some attitude. Now her tone and lack of customer service left much to be desired. When we asked for the owners info for us to contact she stated that the owner doesn't speak English and she could call for me. I didn't believe that someone who owners 4 stores can't understand English. They lost customer for .38 cent food cost and a server to young to know better. Food establishments please train your staff and teach them how to talk to customers."}
{"text":"1st Time here tacos are pretty good 5 Stars for the micheladas and the waitress was awesome on helping make the right decision on my food her name was Denise she's awesome great customer service"}
{"text":"On the advice of Yelp we went here.

It did not disappoint, everything was excellent.

All three of us had something different. 

The chili verde, it was amazing, nice tinder and with just the right amount of heat! The portions were sizable!

Tamales, wow, hand made greatness. I can't say anything bad about these other than the fact the spicy sauce wasn't ordered with them.

The carne asada torta was also great! Nice tender beef, nice amount of avocado good bread and quite nice."}
{"text":"I work near Tony's and once in a while I want some yummy chicken tacos and chips n salsa. I went today and the new server lady was excellent. She was ambitious to help me right away. She even said, \" nice meeting you\" because I told her I go there a lot since I work nearby. Thanks for the smile and great customer service!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food!
This is a little whole in the wall in the Smiths shopping center. Its set up as a sit down restaurant but they also take to go orders. 
It was pretty busy for a Sunday night. We orderd to go and waited for about 20 minutes for our food. The waitresses were very nice and gave us reccomendations.
The enchilida plate was a good size portion a little skimpy on beans and rice. The red sauce packed with garlic and a hint of spice. It just needed some onions. The bean dip and chips is so bomb. You have to order! You get a ton of chips and creamy, cheesy beans. 
The chicken with peppers in cream sauce was great! Tender pieces of chicken, and rich white sauce. It was served with choice of hot and fresh tortillas.
Horchata was Ok, a little watery tasted like it was from a mix. I wish they offered additional aguas frescas. 
Great spot and will be back. I would recommend calling order in, as the wait was a little long."}
{"text":"Mexican restaurant? And charge extra $1.50 for the sour cream in the chilaquiles? Really? last visit for me"}
{"text":"Great restaurant but low rating because the quality of the dish I ordered wasn't up to par. I ordered the Camarones a la diabla. I'm if Mexican origin and have had this many times. It's usually spicy but the dish I had was mainly sweet cocktail sauce. Yuck!"}
{"text":"I eat here at leasts once or twice a week.  I love the cheap soft tacos and the shrimp and octopus cocktail.  The chips are good and the salsa is spicy and delicious.  The staff is always polite and the service is great.  I've never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and all I can say is wow! The food is really delicious and you won't be disappointed. I ordered the chicken enchiladas verdes combo plate and my hubby had the carne asada plate, while my child had the quesadilla kids plate. We all were really happy with the quality of the food, it's just so authentic. Oh yeah, we also ordered the horchata, and it was absolutely perfect, not too sweet and oh so good! 

If you aren't sure about trying this place I suggest you just give it a chance. You will be glad you did."}

{"text":"Once again I'm writing as I eat..
  Chips and salsa while waiting for my order, I added a side of guacamole and sour cream..Cops are good but the salsa, sour cream and guacamole are watery but decently flavored.
  Hard shell shredded beef taco- needed work..the shell is bad and the meat was not shredded nearly enough
  Wet Chili Colorado burrito is a treat...very good
  Rice is very good
  Beans are good
  Service is good

All in all, I like it and I well be back"}
{"text":"We were not impressed. Growing up in Cali did spoil us on good Mexican food. Tony's was just ok."}

{"text":"This is my favorite authentic Mexican Restaurant. I have been coming here for 3 years.

I always have one of the shrimp and octopus cocktails and am never disappointed.

The chips are crisp and fresh while the salsa has a delicious kick to it. I have had the Carnitas, Chili Verde and the Chili Rellano and have enjoyed all of them. I will warn that the Verde has a powerful kick to it.

I love that it has big windows and is very well lit."}
{"text":"The only reason why they get 2 stars from me is because the food was actually good... Prices was ok.. Didn't receive the chips and salsa that I've read about on here.. Wasn't approached by the cashier so we can order our take out for about 20 mins, even though she seen us standing there and smiled!! 

Once we finally ordered it took 45 minutes to get the food!! I had time to walk to food 4 less, get a few groceries, put those in the car, walk back to Tonys and I was still waiting!!! Once I got the food I went home and boy was I disappointed!!!! There was barely any food on my plate!!!! So.. I waited all that time for this small ass plate! I love mexican food and this by far is the smallest shit I ever seen!!! Once I ate it I was STILL hungry!!! I ended up eating cereal afterwards!!! 

To sum it up-- bad customer service, long wait (even though no one was in there), very small portion, no free chips and salsa.. Like I said the only thing saving this place in my eyes is that the food is actually good.."}

{"text":"When I want a Michelada this is the place I come to!! There are times I just crave it especially from here. I love the salsa also, I usually order one to go and take home to snack on (get my salsa fix). I get 3 enchiladas with green sauce. I love the their green sauce, rice, beans, pretty much everything. The service however can be hit or miss. Sometimes they're very attentive and other times not so much. One time I got my food and had to remind them we ordered beers. But I can look past that for my good Mexican food and Michelada."}

{"text":"First time there and from most yelp reviews figured give it a chance. 

Service was meh. They sat us down and brought small basket chips for 3 people. The salsa was very good chunky tomatoes onion cilantro.  Ordered wet style burritos. Ordered carne asada unfortunately it was 70% beans and rice, maybe 20% steak rest salsa onions.  The enchilada sauce comes red basic, green basic & red spicy all very watery. Asked extra chips they replied $1.25 each basket.  I was like really? Oh ok I replied.  Only to bring another basket with salsa cup in half of the basket! Really?  Your burritos are tiny and $2.29 for a soda? 
Sorry but you girls were ok servers, had to ask for refills of soda,  but extra for chips and meh food was hard to see $33 for crap had hard time adding $7 for the tip. I felt violated @$36 for 2 wet burritos 1 chicken enchilada combo 3 sodas.  
Del taco about the same for half price."}
