{"text":"Ramen was good and so was the sushi. The price is decent but they need to give larger portions."}
{"text":"My bf and me were actually planning to eat Sushi at first, but we smelled something really as soon as we entered the store~We were nicely told that they make their own fresh BBQpork every day. No wonder. Then, we decided to try Shoyu Ramen and Sashimi.   The Ramen is well made and delicious with their BBQ pork  Their Sashimi is very fresh as well~My bf finished the whole thing.For sure, we will be back again~  by the way, u can park u cars outside the door~"}
{"text":"Great place to avoid if you're craving ramen.  I paid $12 for the seafood ramen.  The broth tasted like water with sriracha, it had 1 shrimp, a couple of tentacles, 2 mussels and hardly any noodles.  Find another place....hope this helped"}
{"text":"Shogun Sushi & Ramen is a tiny place with 8 tables so you must get reservations especially if you going to use a Groupon.  Server was very nice and attentive.  Food was good and sushi was fresh as well.  Size of the dishes were decent as we had way more than enough food for 2 people.  We also go the sashimi app, dragon roll, tempura platter and Chicken rice."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on Tuesday Nov. 5 to try it out. They had one of those deals from a website.  First off, I didn't read the fine print on those printouts after purchasing those deals online.  When we arrived there at around 7:15pm, there were only two tables occupied by a total of 4 or 5 people.  So it wasn't busy nor a line-up.  The wait staff asked if we had a voucher. I replied yes and she told us we could not be accommodated as the fine print stated that reservations were required.  Yes, my bad for not reading it but what I did not understand was the fact that only 2 tables were occupied.  I would understand if it were a full house or nearly a full house and they would like to leave the few tables left for customers paying the full menu price. However, given that scenario with only 2 tables occupied, my advice to the owner is:    \"You joined the discount promotion programs to gain new customers.  This is not a good first impression and let me tell you, I eat out six of the seven days a week for lunch and dinner and even though I have not used that voucher yet, I will NEVER GO TO THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN!  Your waitress was amazing as she got rid of new customers.  Please give her a promotion for not thinking outside of the box and obeying the fine print.\""}
{"text":"Came here because its walking distance to my house.  Me and my boyfriend both ordered the ramen.  He got the tonkatsu and I got the shoyo.  We usually have our ramen in Kinto, Kenzo or santouka, so this place didn't live up to our expectation.  The broth was good (but not authentic), the cha Su was overcooked, the noodle was store bought, the toppings were kind of disappointing (bak choy, entire piece of wood ear, bean sprout and green onions).    Food aside, the Chinese  staff was friendly and the price was decent $9.95/bowl.    Don't think I'll go back again for ramen, I'll probably drive a little further to first markham place or downtown for ramen."}
{"text":"I too had a similar experience as Paul. Although we were given a table eventhough we had not made a reservation, we were given attitude. The waitress was very rude and that was unacceptable. Also, the food took very long eventhough there were only two other tables. The food was not good either. For a restaurant whose main intention was to promote themselves through coupon websites, they did not give themselves a good first impression. I would definately not reccomend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a total rip off. Their dishes are overpriced and their portion size is like snack or appetizer size. Not worth going to even with a groupon deal. I ordered terriaki chicken with vegetables and rice dinner for 9.95 and the portion was so small. The vegetables were cheap fried bean sprouts! Not even a piece of brocoli! The beef terriaki with vegetables was just as bad. In fact i ate both dishes and was still hungry. Each dish was 9.95 too! The groupon is a rip off cause they force you to order from the rip off areas of their menu. The seafood ramen was a watered down tasteless broth with only one shrimp and some other crap. Stay away from this restaurant youve been warned."}
{"text":"Came here coz craving for ramen and didn't want to drive far. Oopssssssss....... save the time and gas but didn't satisfy my craving : ( Soup tasted like those instant noodle soup, ramen was worse than Nissin cup noodles in the plane, Chashu was dry.  Hmmmm............ is this a ramen place??!!  I wondered............"}
{"text":"We come here almost 10 times a year for birthdays and other traditions. Since we know the manager/owner we get some perks like getting certain types of special sushi and free drinks. wonderful food and deserts. sadly the vice manager had to go and was replaced with a sad old man who hates the people who create the sushi. The original owner is still here and I highly recommend you be his best friend :)"}
{"text":"3.5 star  I came to Shogun with no expectations.  Just another of my lunch special with another sushi restaurant.  However I was pleasantly surprised.  Lunch Special till 4 pm all under $10. I went with my usual sushi choice.  L0 Sushi and Maki ($8.95) with choice of maki roll. Salad and miso soup were both mediocre as best. However, when I saw my sushi, I couldn't get over the effort of the chef with the plating and the care of preparing my lunch. Everything was nicely done and the fish was decent quality too!  I guess I will be back again for dinner and hopefully it will be as good.  Waitress is friendly and efficient. Chinese kitchen staff seems to know how to make decent sushi. Price wise is reasonable and quality way better than other AYCE option.  PS this is now under new management and not related to the previous business Shogun Ramen at all."}
