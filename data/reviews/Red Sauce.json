{"text":"What a great addition to the hood. I came here for some late night snacks last night and they've improved their execution immensely since their first week.   The $6 negronis are great value as mentioned previously. There's something about the opaque cups and ice cubes that made things more...delicious. Three Negronis later I was in a pretty good mood.   For eats, I had the buffalo cucumber (good combo), the knuckle sandwich (solid crust), and the calzones (reminds me of mini pizza pops but wayyy better). All were amazing.   I think the only thing this place is lacking is a clear identity. On one hand they want to be a casual sit down restaurant for families and urbanites alike. On the other hand they want to stay open late and cater to that snack bar crowd. The decor is for the former and the ambience suggests the latter. It's a little confusing. I would also look into some crunchier bread to sop up that amazing sauce on the sandwiches.   Overall, this is a dope spot. And I think it will really come into its own once the World Cup starts."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times now and love the restaurant.   We've had incredible service and they know their stuff. The first time they suggested the shaved salad. And we were not disappointed.   The Knuckle Sandwich is so good. And I'm not sure what everyone is doing with their Muffaletta sandwich, because mine was DYNAMITE.  Love the side veggies (Especially the mushrooms) and the drinks are well priced and made even better.   Everyone says it's a \"girly\" drink, but I have a bad stomach and tend to drink more Vodka now, so the Ivy & Shaddock is excellent for me. And they also use egg whites for their Sours... So you KNOW they know how to make a drink properly.   All in all, I can't wait for dinner this Sunday where I will be for sure getting the pasta and meatballs. MMMMMMM"}
{"text":"Our first, best and most amazing muffuletta experience was in New Orleans at Central Grocery \"home of the original muffuletta\". When we found out that Red Sauce had muffulettas we had to try. Thank you Red Sauce!! You did not disappoint! Fresh focaccia, excellent olive mix, excellent meat and cheese.   The rest of menu items we tried were just as delicious. A previous reviewer commented on the versatility of the place. I couldn't agree more. They're open from 11am-2am every day. They offer a simple menu but in a range of prices and sizes. (Half muffuletta vs whole, italian sandwiches sized in roll, hero or platter.)  My partner and I came here for dinner and shared half a muffuletta, knuckle sandwich (trotter meat braised for 6+ hours in all sorts of aromatics, then covered in panko and fried) served platter style with red sauce (they do a great sauce), spicy rabe, blistered peppers balanced with a creamy lemon aioli, and garlic knots (crispy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside). Finished off with the salted caramel budino (heaven) and a couple of espressos.   Come here with a friend and share some food and drinks. One of the most laid back, simple but delicious meals I've had in Toronto. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious and reasonably priced. We tried the eggplant and meatball sandwiches, as well as the rabe and Caesar salad. The bread was fantastic. Rounded everything off with the salted caramel budino, which will quite possibly change your life. Seriously. Cask negronis and craft cocktails are a steal at $6 and $9, respectively. Waitstaff is friendly and knowledgeable. Can't wait to go back and sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"I've just eaten the best veal sandwich of my life at Red Sauce. It was $5. I would have paid $50. They brine the veal for hours and it was so, so tender. I've got those Jimmy legs you get after a really good, you know, session. Holy Crow.   The knuckle sandwich is also delicious, the maple zeppoles...Dios mio. Wrong language, I know.  PS $6 negronis all the time and $10 premium pitchers on the weekend. Heaven."}
{"text":"1. Not everything is amazing, so make sure you order a sandwich, and get a negroni if you are a cheapskate like me.   2.$6 negronis is unheardof in this town. Reward the proprietors by coming often and tipping well.   3. The knuckle sandwich has never been less than stellar. A true original contribution to Toronto sandwich culture (not original original, but a clever twist within a familiar vein done with praise-worthy finesse).   4. This is the kind of food people should want to be eating all the time. Hmm...what else do I have to say. I dunno. I wish them the best, and that they can work out some fo the kinks, build a loyal following, and lay down more knuckle sandwiches. Honestly: if the people at Red Sauce are listening: let the knuckle sandwich be your lodestar. If something is not as flat-out delicious as the knuckle sandwich, take it off the menu. If you could get a bench full of knuckle sandwich level foods, you would be truly deserving of lasting success. But...as it stands...I see great promise."}
{"text":"Based on some favourable reviews, we stopped by to get a couple of Italian sandwiches for lunch.  Apparently, we should have got the eggplant, as we were both disappointed by the quality of meat used in the sandwiches (chicken and pork respectively).  The staff were friendly and responsive and I'd definitely come back here for a drink sometime."}
{"text":"The place is still in need of some tweaking.  Found that the garlic knots were undercooked in the middle which was a disappointment because they had a great crunch on the outside.  Eggplant parmigianna was kind of blah. Undercooked as well, and just not  as juicy (greasy) as other places.  Knuckle sandwhich was great, however annoyed they use panko instead of real italian style breadcrumbs.   Best part of the entire experience was the tiramissu."}
{"text":"Go eat the knuckle sandwich immediately.  It is $5 on Tuesdays and they have a lovely patio."}
{"text":"Had the meatball roll. Bread was beautiful fresh, red sauce was delicious and the meat balls were pretty good. I enjoyed it and will go back."}
{"text":"I was told about this place by a friend so I decided to give it a try. As I walked in I was surprised that it looked more like a bar then a place to get Italian sandwiches. The place was very clean and well maintained. I ordered the large veal sandwich. I asked to have it xtra hot. The bill came to $15 dollars a little pricy. The veal itself was pretty good the veal was a little tough but still good the sauce was zesty and very delicious just the right amount of sauce. The major problem I had with it was they used bandanna peppers with I am sorry but are not hot at all   Guys please get some hotter peppers. All in all was a decent veal sandwich"}
{"text":"I have liked this space in all it's incarnations, but Red Sauce is the first place I've actually loved beyond aesthetics. But let's still talk about the aesthetics! Huge Street-side patio on Cinton facing cute homes and, (unfortunately) the Dip, lovely tile interior and nice artistic touches at every turn.    I've had their veal sandwich and their calzones, and they were both saucy, salty bundles of goodness. They have draft specials, $6 negronis on tap and $28 prosecco bottles. Basically Red Sauce is speaking my language! Thus I give them five enthusiastic cheers!   PEPPER'S PISSED: I do have to mention, though, that their World Cup cable is about five seconds behind the Dip and it's really annoying if you're there watching a game. Also, my veg-head friend got their Buffalo Cucumbers, and it's a pretty sad little side, just cold cukes in hot sauce. Le what?"}
