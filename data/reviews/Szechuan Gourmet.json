{"text":"One of the newer Chinese restaurants in the asian town area. I was skeptical about trying this place because my parents went and did not give me a rave review about it.  I decided I wanted to try it out myself and it was a good choice for a friend who enjoys spicy food. Since the first visit, I have been here more then a handful of times.   The food is different from your typical restaurants in the area. The portions range from small to medium, dependent on what you order. The menu can be confusing...there is a dessert section, but not your typical sweet desserts. You know the food is not far from authentic cuisine when there are Chinese characters on the menu.   They have 2 Karaoke rooms. The dining area is small and can get crowded. They have multiple large tables that can fit large parties.  I have come with friends from all cultures to try the food. My most recent visit, I came with co-workers. I was the most \"Asian\" of the group, so I earned the responsibility of ordering? Since it was a party of 3, we ordered only a few dishes:   - Braised mushroom with Bok Choy - one of my favorite vegetable dishes here. Bok Choy is actually inexpensive to buy and cook at home, but well worth the money when dining here. It is a nice complement to the multiple spicy dishes on the menu. - Pork with garlic sauce - I first noted this dish when glancing over at another table. Looked good, so we ordered it to give a try. A favorite of mine as well. The pork is cooked with some sort of vegetable in the potato family? Nice compliment to the meat.  - Dan Dan Noodle - cheap and filling. Prob the spiciest dish that evening. Normally I share the noodle with someone, but I was feeling greedy and wanted one all to myself. Flat white noodle, minced spicy meat with some greens. A must try!  I recommend to explore the menu and enjoy the different levels of spice. You can always ask for less or more spice dependent on your preference. Better yet, go with someone who can speak the native tongue and let them do the ordering. Sit back and enjoy the meal with a glass of water on the side!"}
{"text":"Arguably some of the best Chinese food in Cleveland.  Seating and service are always quick and friendly and portions are very generous.  I've ordered very few things off the menu that weren't great.  The eggplant with garlic sauce is my favorite of their offerings.  Crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside and doused in a liberal amount of flavorful garlic sauce with just the right amount of heat.  Not disappointing for my chili head boyfriend, but moderate enough for those with more spice sensitive palates.  Pea shoots with garlic are always delicious.  The shredded pork in spicy garlic sauce is another highlight-- flavorful, surprisingly light and laden with crunchy bamboo shoots and wood ear mushrooms.  I often order the ho fun because it's difficult to find elsewhere in Cleveland-- tasty, but a bit bland.  I've ordered the dumplings once and they were forgettable.  One word of caution-- be aware that if you come around the time they are sitting down to family meal (usually around 9pm), you will be rushed to order without much time for deliberation."}
{"text":"We I have enjoyed the eggplant in garlic sauce, Trotter's in chili garlic sauce and fish and vegetables in spicy sauce"}
{"text":"Really nice restaurant. We enjoyed the food a lot. I agree with most other reviewers that the Szechuan food here is the most authentic around Cleveland area."}
{"text":"This place cannot be beat. Service is outstanding. Be prepared to be adventurous as they can blow your mind. I am addicted and eat here at least once a week.. The only complaint is the bathroom that they don't have control over as it is shared with the grocery store in the same building."}
{"text":"I've been here three times and only once was I slightly disappointed. Would definitely recommend this place to any meat loves because this place gives you meat...and a lot of it.  P.S. The dish that I wasn't too happy with was the beef cumin. Maybe if you LOVE cumin you can try it, but honestly it was just too overpowering for me. Couldn't taste anything else."}
{"text":"My experience was diametrically opposed to that of Rob M's, and all others, who have given this restaurant one star.  But those negative reviews were the main reason why I had to try this restaurant as it seemed that you either loved or hated the place.  We loved it!    The hot and sour soup was delicious. Not thick or syrupy and with great flavor.  The cold noodles with chicken in a spicy sauce was absolutely divine.   The three style pepper chicken was a bit dry but tasty, although it was clearly deep-fried. Next time I will try that soft chicken which was labeled \"new\" on our menu. I say definitely come here and experiment and experience different dishes.  It's well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Good food, exceeded expectations for this sort of venue in cleveland.  Price level was very reasonable and service was solid."}
{"text":"Got the lemon chicken lunch take out special and was expecting to get more than what I got. I paid an extra $1.97 +tax to change the white rice for fried rice and everything came in a small single styrofoam container. I thought it would be in a medium styrofoam container considering I paid $12. Not bad though.. Food was great."}
{"text":"I am only rating this dish five stars and it is the hot and spicy beef with peanuts.  It is amazing. Order two of these for dinner because it is that good and you won't want anything else.  This is probably the only reason to move close to Steeles and Bathurst."}
{"text":"Delicious!   Had scallion pancakes and hunan beef with black beans.   Very friendly and Fast to go service."}
{"text":"The food here is good. Some of it is actually VERY good. That's not the problem.  This is my second time here. And this is the second time that as a Caucasian,  I have not felt welcome. The servers are curt, unaccomodating, and inflexible. Bear that in mind if you go here."}
{"text":"Outstanding!!!   Best traditional Chinese for at least 300 miles.   Nothing really comes close.   If there is any downside it is that you need a native to translate the \"real\" menu.   Hands down this is the best in cleveland.  You need to  eat here with a large group.   Once for hot pot and once for the whole of the menu.   Picky eaters should look elsewhere."}
{"text":"One word: Unbelievable  I never would have found this amazing little place out north if not for Yelp and Devan R convincing me to try the best Hakka food I'd been missing out on at the last Elite event.  The 11 of us at this restaurant on a Tuesday night  for a UYE were quickly accommodated. We let Devan order for us as he needed to prove if it really WAS the best Hakka food around, and he seemed to know what the house specialties were. And boy was he right.  Started with soup, Hot and Sour and Crab Corn Soup (or was it chicken?). I wasn't a big fan of the Hot and Sour, had a very very slight bitter taste to it, and quite unlike any soup i have had before, maybe i need to give it another try to figure out its complexity. Corn soup, is what i grew up on, and this place does it WELL. This is the comfort food of my dreams. Even better with the chilli oil.  Moving on to the main dishes, the Shrimp sizzler tasted more Indian than Chinese, even with the spring onions and crisp veggies, a bit like how my grandma makes it (her cooking is Burmese/Indian influenced). Very flavourful, perfect with plain rice.  Crispy Beef, was the highlight of the night. VERY crispy covered in just the right amount of sauce to keep it that way. Slightly sweet, I guess the closest I can describe it as is crispy teriyaki. A complete flavour explosion that the texture only enhances. Didn't taste very \"beefy\". In fact if I didn't know it had beef, I would not be able to tell. Tied with Shrimp Sizzler as my favourite. Ginger Chicken - Amazing as well. Not AS crispy as the beef, bit less sweet. Great choice as well. Peanut Chicken - felt a bit more like Thai food.. reminded me of satay. Had a gravy/sauce. Not one of my favourites. Hakka Noodles - Wasn't too impressed with this. Your average hakka noodle dish.  Chilli Chicken - Was spicy, flavourful but unlike the stuff heavy on the ginger, garlic and sauce/gravy that I've had at many other Hakka restaurants, it had no sauce. Was super good as well.  I'd recommend trying everything with plain rice, to get the true flavour, uncomplicated by the seasoning in the noodles. I found this place a bit unusual from the other Hakka places i have tried, as it seems to have more \"sweet\" flavours in the dishes.Something that is uncommon in Indian cooking, and Hakka places that I've tried in the GTA. Maybe its the Szechwan coming through? Regardless, most of the food tried was awesome and incredibly flavourful and is making my mouth water as i write this.   Also the service was superb! The waitstaff has psychic abilities. Very attentive, quick, and knew what we wanted before we asked for it.  Solid 5 stars! Wish i had a car so I could go here more!"}
{"text":"After seeing all of the positivity Yelp had to offer this place, I bookmarked it and forgot about it. Today, Beardyman was feeling adventurous, \"Let's get lunch somewhere we have never been.\" He said. Out came the bookmarks and here we are.  This place is fantastic. Hidden away a bit but not hard to find. There is parking on site. We went around 2.30 in the afternoon and they were busy, but not too busy. Everything looked clean. Clean white table clothes, clean floor, nothing was sticky or greasy. We were seated right away, someone took drink orders right away. The menu was extensive and contained familiar items as well as things which seemed a bit more interesting. There are frog dishes, rabbit, duck, all sorts of offal.  We took a few minutes to decide what we wanted and our food took maybe fifteen minutes to come out. It was so fast.   I was thankful for all of the helpful people on Yelp giving such great recommendations of what to order.   We started off with some dumplings. Smooth and white, just enough filling, dipped in a savory, spicy sauce. Yum. I got the broccoli in garlic sauce--delicious. A big pile of broccoli, bell pepper, and soft black mushrooms. The sauce was spicy but so good. After reading all of the reviews of how spicy everything was, I was a little nervous. I like spicy food, but not too spicy. This was definitely spicy but not in the way that makes you sweat. Just delicious and flavorful.  Beardyman got the beef dry pot which was great. I ate a bunch of his bean sprouts. It tasted distinctly different from my dish and was very, very delicious.   None of the vegetables in our food were overcooked. Everything was crunchy and vibrant.   10 for 10 will go again. Best Chinese food in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Went to this place on 8/23/12  - staff was very helpful, seemed concerned that we didn't know what we were getting ourselves into , heat wise. They do have beer. We started with a couple of Tsing Tao's.  For apppetizer we ordered a beef tripe & tendon in a spicy sauce - excellent flavour and very spicy!  We saved the hot sauce in case the next dish wasn't spicy enough. Ha.... Next we moved on to the Szechuan fish. This came served in a small wok with bowls of rice. The dish is covered with dried whole chilies and the center is garnished with ground peppers. This was absolutely delicious!!! Small tender pieces of fish with soy sprouts and sliced Napa infused with a tongue numbing dose of Szechuan pepper corns in an extra spicy broth - not for the faint of heart. We Finished with the Cumin Lamb. Again, very spicy with an intense cumin flavouring. Thin slices of lamb with onions, peppers and dreid Szechuan chilies also served with white rice. This was the first time I've eaten in a Cleveland restaurant and didn't have to ask for additional hot chili. Kudos - we will be back to sample the rest of the menu very soon."}
{"text":"Super delicious Szechuan fare!  Go off the grid a bit and you will be really pleased. The vegetarian dishes are excellent as well. They are very accommodating with special requests and the service is lightening fast.  I asked for no msg or substituted proteins.  I also asked for less sauce as I don't like my food too saucy.  They gladly complied with my requests, serving up delicious food.    My family and I have made this place a must stop while in town from NYC.  It is straightforward spicy, Asian bonanza!"}
{"text":"Ordered the beef ho fun (noodles were okay but i think they lightly battered and deep fried the beef before smothering it in black bean sauce). Special fried rice was bleh and the hot and sour soup was pretty bad and we were starving! Great service though and friendly staff. The place was packed the night we went but we were the only Asians in the room. Felt like I was in a pickle barrel lol."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  We came twice in a row here.  There is some variations in cooking but overall pretty good.  Great dishes are mapo tofu and green bean. The following are good: shousi baocai, bitter melon, home style tofu, eggplant w brown sauce, pao cai, chuanbei liangfen. Shanyao is ok."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Chinese! We had the fish pot, sautéed green beans, lamb skewers, sliced duck and crispy beef. Very spicy but in a good way! Very prompt service."}
{"text":"Being Chinese, I have pretty high expectations when it comes to Chinese food.  I've been looking for a place that sells authentic ??? Sichuan poached sliced fish in hot chili oil like I had in China when I was living there.  I was hoping this place had it and they do! It's very tasty, not just spicy.  My preschooler loved it too, so it is definitely not overly spicy (I have a very high tolerance for heat!)  Make sure to check the specials for the week on the right side wall upon entering otherwise you might miss out on some great dishes!  Owner is very friendly, as I didn't bring my cell phone and he let me borrow the restaurant phone and was very nice about it.    Their house fried rice wasn't anything to write home about, but then again, fried rice is not the signature dish of Sichuan food...  Definitely returning and introducing friends to this great gem of a restaurant!"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant. Taste is great and reasonable price. Mapo tofu, shrimp with garlic sauce and seven steps duck are awesome."}
{"text":"This was my first time having Hakka cuisine and with about 200 choices on the menu, we left the ordering in the deft hands of Devan R. who's a regular at Szechuan Gourmet.  The two standout dishes of the night were crispy ginger chicken and crispy beef. Both had incredibly crisp, thin batter coatings that shattered at first bite. The ginger chicken was all white meat but somehow remained as plump and juicy as a milkmaid's bosom. The beef came in thinner strips and was caramelized to the point of delightful, near-jerky chewiness. Although each of the platters had plenty of Szechuan peppers in them, the heat was subtle, mostly tempered by the sweet glaze.  Even the two soups we ordered, chicken corn and hot & sour, were flavorful. Not at all the MSG baths served at most Chinese restaurants. (Suzan K. take note!) Per Devan's suggestion, I drizzled a little chile oil into the corn soup which brought another dimension to the broth.  The service was always attentive without being overly effusive. No sullen teen servers here! They refilled teapots without prompting and seemed all too happy to clear plates.  We must've ordered about a dozen dishes with some rice, a few bottles of Tsing Tao beer, and soda and the total bill was only $190 + tip for the eleven of us. There was even food left over to take home!  I will say that it's quite a lot of fried food to consume at one sitting. I am still gut-achingly stuffed (but happy!), sitting in my stretchy pants, over four hours after the meal. Also, the restaurant is quite warm so dress in layers! Between the heat in the room, the warming effects of ginger and hot tea, and the collective body heat radiating from my 10 dining companions I thought I might've been hitting early menopause.  Szechuan Gourmet makes me feel conflicted; the food is amazing and I know I'll want to go again but it's really far from downtown and inaccessible by public transportation. Arrgghh!"}
{"text":"We called to place a big order, there were a few things missing. We called to complain and a chinese lady answered and claims that's it's impossible that they did an error. There were 4 people working in the kitchen, so it's impossible that all 4 of them made this error. There are no customer service at all. Accusing me lying. She wants us to count how many aluminium container we got, but we already ate everything and they are in the garbage already. We're not gonna go touch the garbage again. We order here from time to time and it's always big order. Not smart to do that to a long term customer. Their foods are good in general, but they are not blacklisted. I won't recommend to place any big order with them, you'll be frustrated if they make an error."}
{"text":"This place is great. We loved the three pepper chicken and garlic eggplant. Not a place for those of you hung up on \"cleanliness\" and \"sanitary conditions\". Our server's English was fine. In my observations servers often forget how to speak English when dealing with obnoxious WGs."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good service or authentic Chinese food, go elsewhere. But if you just need to satisfy a craving for Chinese food that is a few notches above the food court, I highly recommend Szechuan Gourmet.   That hostess is rude every single time. The waiters looked bored by your order. After the first few bites, everything starts to taste that sweet, brown sauce flavour. But no matter what, I start getting vicious cravings for Szechuan Gourmet if I hadn't had it for awhile. The heart wants what the heart wants."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food I have had in Cleveland. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Stay Away!!! We ordered from this place and we ALL got super sick with diarrhea, upset stomach, you name it!! The crispy ginger beef had NO BEEF; it was just fried doe with sauce. I don't even want to describe the other food we ate because the thought of it makes me want to vomit!  FIRST & LAST FOR US!  I wish they had a zero star rating!"}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food! Love going here. Foods taste great with great service and awesome price!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants. My group of friends and I come here so often that the servers already have the biggest smiles on their faces when they see us. All the people that work here are amazing. The food is always delicious and THEY BRING IT OUT SO FAST. Anytime someone asks which chinese place to go to, I always recommend this place."}
{"text":"The crispy ginger chicken is indeed good, I also like their sweet and sour pork - nothing like other Asian restaurants where you nibble on bite size pieces where it's mostly batter. Here you get big hunking slabs of pork slathered in the oh soo good sweet and sour sauce. Other than those two dishes, the rest of the items we ordered were just ok. The prawns with hot spicy ginger sauce and the szechuan chicken we ordered had no kick to them. I expect my mouth to be flaming when having Szechuan cuisine.   As some fellow reviewers branded this place Hakka food, I don't quite agree with that, I would say it is Szechuan style. If you want a truly Hakka experience (by that I mean Indian Chinese cuisine - as Hakka also refers to a certain group of people in China and their cuisine is not even close to what is offered at Szechuan Gourmet Restaurant) I would recommend Tangerine Asian Cuisine, but be prepared, the spiciness could blow your socks off!"}
{"text":"If there is a zero star, I wish to give it a zero. Horrible service...Waitresses look like chicken without head, run around, but no service. Wait for more than one hour, no dish is ready for us. When they cooked one dish, which is extremely slow also, they  even don't know who they should deliver to. Most of the tables wait for more than one hour to get their first dish, and can't get all of their dish ready within two hours!! Horrible!! Will definitely not go there anymore...."}
{"text":"This is food court chinese food, but with higher quality ingredients.  I am not a fan of this style but if you are, I am sure you will love this place. It's very greasy, very sweet, and the sauces are very thick. I suspect all the food is pre-made in the back as it literally comes out moments after you order it.  Wonton Soup was bland, and the dumplings were very doughy. Hot and Sour Soup was decent but personally I think it needed more heat. Spring Roll was excellent, very fresh, very crispy, highly recommend. Served with VH sauce thou. Ginger Crispy Chicken, was pretty good although very sweet, very greasy and very salty House Special Rice, excellent Beef with Snow peas were ok, sauce was very thick, very salty  Overall this is just not what I look for in terms of quality chinese food. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Another okay Chinese restaurant   My favorite here in cleveland is wonton groumet and siam cafe I tried every single Chinese restaurant including lihwa bolong  I tried deep fried pork shop baked shrimp general chicken which were just okay  I will give it a shot one more time will update"}
{"text":"The food is plain garbage.  I will highly recommend you seek some alternate restaurants.  Placed an order for  chilli chicken with gravy, crispy ginger chicken, hot and sour soup and Singapore noodles after reading so much good recommendations. Food was expensive, but I didnt mind that because I expected quality for the money more so than quantity. Although I was reading you get both. Here is my experiance: Chilli chicken with gravy: If I would of known that the gravy is mostly of oil, I would of avoided this dish. Has some flavors but the oil is overpowering.  CRISPY GINGER CHICKEN: Deepfried chicken that has soked up a good quantity of oil, which again is tossed in a wok with oil and other components. The dish is overcooked--well more like burned. IT TOO IS FLOATING IN A POOL OF OIL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DISH.  Hot and sour soup: Taste is acceptable, but is plain watery. Singhapore noodle: Taste is acceptable but again oily.  OVERALL NOT RECOMMENDED UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE VERY SICK VERY QUICKLY COMPAIRED TO STANDARD HAKKA CUISINE. I wish I can upload pics but I will try."}
{"text":"Unique and delicious!  My girlfriend and I visited Szechuan Gourmet for the first time yesterday and were very impressed. We were initially drawn to Szechuan Gourmet because it was beside the Asian Grocery we typically shop \"Tinkholl\", and secondly by the distinctive dishes displayed, on the menu in the entry way. I was glad to see that the menu contained many dishes, not typically found on other menus. I ordered the Beef Stomach with vegetables and hot pepper, my girlfriend chose the Eggplant in Black Bean Sauce. When looking at the menu, my initial impression was that the meals were a little highly priced, however when our meals arrived, that thought was quickly gone. My dish arrived in a large well heated metal bowl and my girlfriend's dish arrived in a large glass pie pan, from reading other reviews, most dishes are family portions, made to share. The Beef Stomach with vegetables and hot pepper, contained a good amount of tripe and a good variety of vegetables (two full meals with leftovers) and had a spiciness that made my brow sweat, just as I had hoped. All too often spicy dishes do not live up to their description, however the Beef Stomach with vegetables and hot pepper did not disappoint. Beyond that, the Tripe was very flavorful and tender, not typical of most tripe dishes. Also, the broth was very unique and flavorful paired nicely with the slight sweetness of the Tripe, would definitely order again! The dish my girlfriend selected, the Eggplant in Black Bean Sauce was also very good. This consisted of three whole eggplants sliced in quarters long ways, lightly breaded, pan fried. The Eggplant was perfectly seared and crispy, not at all soggy as can be the case when cooking Eggplant. Additionally, the Black Bean Sauce was quite dynamic both slightly sweet and spicy and different than Vietnamese Black Bean dishes I had tried. I would definitely would order the dish for myself. I can't wait for my next trip to Cleveland to try another dish!       Finally, we were very pleased with the service. Our servers were prompt, friendly and helpful in deciding from the large menu, we were not left waiting for anything. If you like a unique authentic meal definitely try the Szechuan Gourmet we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant had a wonderful array of food. I can't wait to come back and try more. The appetizers were very good...The crab ragoon was so light and crisp with a flavorful creamy filling.  The steamed dumplings were enjoyable as well. The spring rolls were also light and crisp.  The fish hot pot was spicy but not overly so. It was a pleasant mix of vegetables and the fish was done just right.  The portion was enough for two. The shrimp and broccoli & beef lo mein were also noteworthy.  The beef portion was large enough for 2 as well. Interesting menu choices included jellyfish and conch. I wish they had a sampler platter so I could have tried some of the more exotic selections. This was our first foray into little Asia. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on yelp with rave reviews, so my friend (who loves szechuan food) and I try it out.  upon walking in, we are the only chinese customers in the restaurant. the menu is mainly an english one with our favourite szechuan dishes missing (ex. Sichuan Boiled Fish and Cold Spicy Beef). maybe that's our ordering, but every dish was too fried, too greasy and too battered. we could not finish what we ordered and ended up with 3 boxes of leftovers. as a chinese person, i cannot recommend this restaurant ... instead, go 15 mins away for a much more authentic and flavourful szechuan experience @ http://www.yelp.ca/biz/hot-spicy-spicy-north-york"}
{"text":"This Chinese restaurant is awesome!I always order the dry pot for takeout. First, they are super fast. They don't even give you a time because they know it will be ready by the time you get there. Secondly the service is good. Whoever answers the phone is always very nice and accommodating. Their English is not perfect but one can understand them. And they are happy to repeat themselves and speak slowly.thirdly the food is awesome. The portions are huge and everything tastes delicious. The only complaint I would have is the price. $15 for Chinese food is probably a little steep. But in Cleveland it is the best there is."}
{"text":"I am from Sichuan area. Didn't expect to find a decent Sichuan restaurant here in Cleveland. But this one amazed me. Really good food with nice services.  I will give it 6 stars if they serve hot pot on weekend too :)"}
{"text":"For a local Person from Szechuan, I just liked the dry chicken pot, other things were just okay!"}
{"text":"The best place in the city and maybe even North America for Chinese food (American/Canadian style, I don't think they do real Chinese food).    Sometimes the girl who answers the phone is unpleasant but it is totally worth it."}
{"text":"Dinner last night was excellent!!  From the friendly wait staff, to the delectable entries!  The Singapore noodle was excellent, lots of chicken, pork, and shrimp!  Lemon chicken was light and crispy, with a tangy lemon sauce, will order sauce in the side next time.  It got a little crowded, but was well worth it!  I recommend a reservation!!  They do keep them!!  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic small, homey restaurant in Clevelands asia town  They have two different menus, one of which is the americanized non-descript chinese food like you usually find a a chinese restaurant (think fried rice and moo goo gai pan) the other is traditional fantastic authentic Szechuan.    We had the fish \"dry pot\" which was friend fish in a spicy peppery crust served with tofu, veggies, chilis in a metal wok a well as lotus root with peanuts, which is as it sounds.  The dry pot was a bit too salty for my taste, but otherwise everything was great.  We will definitely be back !!!"}
{"text":"Fastest service  ever! Greatest  food. Very flavorful.  I've  been going for 14 years and i can't  get enough! The  staff can be difficult  if you need to send something  back.  Asians  are not  business  savy in the  customer  service  department."}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer for both take out/delivery and dine in. This evening my wife and I decided to order delivery and when it arrived after 45 minutes, it was stone cold. I called the restaurant to tell them that the food was cold, and was promptly put on hold for five minutes. After being reconnected, I was informed that it was impossible that the food was cold, as they checked with the kitchen and that it had been made to order. I asked the women on the phone, Cecilia, if I was wrong that it was cold. She said that it was impossible and \"anyways, what did i expect from delivery?\" I told he I expected it to be \"warm, at least.\" She then reiterated that it was impossible that it was cold, as they have never received a phone call for this issue and become quite heated (no pun intended). I responded in kind and was then hung up on.  My wife then called, saying she wanted to bring the food back and expected to have our money returned. Cecilia then proceeded to berate my wife by saying that the customer is not always right, that we were just disastisfied and we will not get our money back, She then hung up on my wife.  So we then packed up the food in order to return it to the restaurant. My wife took the food in and was then told that the cook said the food was hot and that it had been an hour since we ordered and since the customer is not always right we will not get our money back. And then pointedly looking at my wife's pregnant stomach, told her that \"Your moods should not effect my business.\" Realising that she would get no further with such an obtuse individual, my wife got the contact information for the owner and left."}
{"text":"Great authentic Szechuan food! Have not had a bad dish so far! I always order the mapo tofu! Always a nice kick!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch to try this infamous Ginger Chicken dish that's been yelped so heavily about.   So out it came. It was chicken breast strips, coated in a light crispy batter. Deep fried and liberally splashed with this intensely sweet and spicy dark brown sauce.   At first, like tequila it's fun the first time. But after awhile it becomes tiring. I felt the need a little more variety, perhaps some vegetables or something else to counter the flavours.   After a while I felt like I was eating Ginger Chicken Candy. Crunch, crunch crunh.  It was alright,  but I'll have to go back with some people to try some other dishes.  My Ginger Chicken combo came with soup to start (choose from wonton, hot and sour, egg drop) plus a bowl of white rice.  Oh one thing I didn't like during my meal, the lady at the front booth, just stands there staring. I was being watched my every move..  Hmm.."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef haw fun and it was the worst I've ever had. I order the same dish at other restaurants and it was better than this place."}
{"text":"Used to be great... no longer!! Very poor service, they forgot our food and food most definitely not as nice as it once was, everything was drowned in soya sauce, crispy chicken was soggy and reheated... awful ... will not be coming back!"}
{"text":"I always love spicy  food and my friend recommended this place to me, but cannot be more disppointed. We ordered the spicy fish and it tasted like the fish was dead for too long, couldn't describe how it tasted but just had a funny taste. The beef with cumin was overcooked and dry,  The tao chicken was still raw inside. Other dishes were OK but definitely not worth the price. One star for the string bean but I think you can get this in any Chinese restaurant.   About the environment, I wasn't quite comfortable the sec I walked in because I think their setting was so strange. The bathroom was the most disgusting place I ever seen. Besides being stink, the toilet was kinda stuck, and I literally saw a rat running through the hallway when I came out. Totally lost my appetite.  The waitress was SO rude that we asked if she could recommend anything for us since it was our first time being there, and she was like \"you can read the menu and i'll be back when you are ready to order\" And we told her that the fish tasted funny and she insisted that's how it supposed to taste like. I mean, she didn't even know how it tasted like. We didn't even bothered complaining the raw chicken.  In short, never gonna return."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I haven't eaten in the restaurant, but I've had take-out many times and it's the best! Definitely always craving it! For recommendations, look at the pics attached."}
{"text":"This restaurant is adjacent to Tink Holl (Chinese grocery) on E. 36th about a block south of Payne.  If you approach from Payne you need to go just past the first signs you see to find the parking lot and entrance.  The service there is exceptional and the staff are very friendly and helpful.    Some of the food menu items are quite good and it is hard to go wrong with their fried rice and mandoo dumplings (sorry forgot Chinese name).  Although they present themselves as Szechuan the heat is toned down.  Ah, way down, but you can remedy that by asking for chile oil. The other dishes we sampled were average at best, but this is Cleveland and we are still looking for our first really good Chinese restaurant.  The pea shoots with garlic were not bad as far as taste, but the vegetables were not properly drained so the dish came to the table soupy.  But, at least they were only slightly overcooked.  The spicy beef dish was the weakest of the four dishes we had.  The beef had been pounded out to tenderize it, but the dried chiles that were added for flavor had not been effectively rehydrated.  As a result chewing the pepper pieces was a bit like chewing sandpaper.  I'm adjusting my rating one star higher than I normally would because they are very nice there ... So a 5 for service, courtesy and adjacent parking and easy access combine with the 3 for food to be a 4.  Plus they have beer and wine."}
{"text":"LOVE their Broccoli in Spicy Garlic Sauce. They'll sub fried rice for no charge with their lunch special which also includes your choice of soup or 2 eggrolls, the portion is gigantic and it's 6.95. The sauce is so good you can drink it lol. Haven't tried much other, except Hunan Chicken which I didn't like so much."}
{"text":"As a Sichuanese I'd say the food is good though not very authentic. But it is absolutely more authentic than any of the Chinese Restaurant in Ohio. Oh well about the hygien, no comments."}
{"text":"Authentic, friendly and tasty.  Try the cucumber appetizer and the garlic broccoli."}
{"text":"Good food, helpful staff.  Dan Dan noodles were tasty and generous, dumplings good, and the crispy Szechuan Shrimp did not disappoint."}
{"text":"I have very mixed feelings about this place. I had a serious craving for General Tsao's Chicken and this place was closest to my home so I thought I'd check it out. I found the service to be pretty rude. No eye contact, in and out, no banter or small talk and they had their nose up in the air. I asked for a coke and the guy brought me diet (I'm not sure if this was intentional or just a simple error but if intentional, props for subtlety!). So with that I only had one last thing that could make me like this place: the food. Low and behold, my meal was very good, with a very short wait time as well. It satisfied my General Tsao craving successfully. So I recommend that to anyone who likes spicy chicken. This place, however, perhaps not. Not unless you don't mind how your waiter treats you and only come for fast service and good food. Suppose that's what it's all about in the final analysis. 6/10"}
{"text":"It's the best tasting Chinese food I have had in Cleveland.  I was taken there by a Chinese colleague who is a foodie.  I've been there twice now. Once with a party of four and the other time with a party of eight.  I was able to sample all the dishes both times.  Everything was delicious.  They take their time serving the meal and the service is indifferent.  This must be a signature of authentic Chinese restaurants.  It reminds of the restaurants in Flushing, NY.  Great food, bad service.  Make sure you have plenty of time.  Last time with eight colleagues, lunch took two hours.  Still, everyone I've gone with are willing to put up with the service for the food.  I'm going back today."}
{"text":"Fast delivery service.  Quick eat   Crispy ginger beef came burnt as shit and they didn't slice up the beef."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for Chinese szechuan style food. Portions are big and prices are reasonable. Last time I was here I ordered the bean curd in black bean sauce which was probably the best tofu dish I've had at a Chinese restaurant. Also ordered the string beans in a szechuan sauce which was very tasty and spicy. Singapore noodles can be made vegetarian and were also good and had lots of veggies in them.   Also ordered the Broccoli in garlic sauce but did not like this dish as it is actually sweet and didn't go well with the other dishes. Food comes super fast even when they are at capacity and service is good. Don't forget to ask for the chilli vinegar to accompany your meal.   I would not classify this restaurant as Hakka style as most dishes don't contain any Indian flavour and there are no manchurian style dishes or paneer dishes. But for what it is, it is amazing. Will be back forsure."}
{"text":"Great food if you care for spicy!  This is becoming one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Cleveland. If you care for spicy food, I would definitely recommend the new spicy dry pot that just came out.   Aside from that, my personal favorites include: Gan Guo Ji (spicy dry pot chicken, make sure you ask for the chicken to be boneless), Fu Qi Fei Pian, Shui Zhu Yu Pian (spicy fish filet), and Taro & Chicken (again, make sure you ask for boneless)."}
{"text":"We were hoping this place would live up to the reviews and pics and we're not disappointed- very authentic, fresh and tasty.   If you order an appetizer make sure you eat it fast.   The wifey and I ordered 4 entrees with the idea of days of leftovers - eggplant, 3 pepper chicken, lamb and a tofu/fish dish.  Somewhat hot/spicy but all part of an authentic experience.  The entrees came out one at a time but that just meant they were hot and not lukewarm.   Think we saw a new dish on our table every 3 minutes.  Not a lot of steamed rice but we didn't mind - meant it didn't get in the way of the flavors.  If you're tired of \"Chinese-American\" and want to step it up, head for this place!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food I've ever had. They have an outstanding kung pao sauce. I love going here whenever I can."}
{"text":"Quality, chinese food, quick, in a no frills yet very clean setting. There is a fish tank with live fish and lobsters in the back that just shows how fresh the food is. All of the chicken was quality meat, and I could not find any gross, or low quality pieces. I also asked for them to make a dish more mild, and it still had great flavor, without overpowering my mouth with spice.  Great service, food, and promptness. Only complaint is that it is so authentic, that there are no descriptions for the menu items so I had a hard time picking what to order. Scope out the menu before.. Everyone in my group LOVED the Lo Mein noodles. Wonton soup also had amazing flavor. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"We were visiting Toronto to see our family.  Coming from Los Angeles where food is an art and eating it is a science, and there are almost as many restaurants as people, we didn't expect to be bowled over by a Chinese restaurant in a non-descript plaza.  But we were!  We invited 12 people to a family dinner and when we arrived our table awaited us together with a coterie of not one, not two, but three servers helping us get settled. We ordered three of their dibbers for four, but the head waiter insisted it would be too much food, and showed us how to order to save money.  Unheard of behavior, in Los Angeles anyway!  The food arrived and it was truly gourmet, just as the name of the restaurant promised.  And it never stopped coming and coming.  we had a wonderful time and we'll be coming back every time we visit Toronto!"}
{"text":"First off, I am surprised as anyone that I did not enjoy this place based upon numerous other reviewers.  I ordered (for takeout) the cucumbers with chili and vinegar.  This dish was quite good and was the highlight of the meal.  And this comes from a non-fan of cucumbers.  Also I ordered the Szechaun dried pepper chicken with peanuts and the Three-Style Pepper chicken.  Both of these I ordered Xtra hot or as I said, \"Szechaun hot\".  I received a a minor smile/laugh from the young man that hardly spoke any english that took my order.  I came to the conclusion that the three pepper chicken is basically the Szechaun dried pepper chicken with the inclusion of peanuts.  And the three pepper chicken was basically small over-fried pieces of chicken that were tossed with a myriad of dried red peppers.  I did see a second type of pepper in the dish but I certainly could not identify a third type.  Flash forward and take this same dish and toss in peanuts - presto, we have the dried pepper chicken with peanuts.  No sauce to the dishes, no moisture to the dish - just dried pieces of chicken and a outrageous amount of dried peppers tossed together.  I guess I was expecting some other vegetable in the dish or the dish to have some type of sauce or liquid to it.  Portions were fine - the rectangular styrofoam takeout containers.  Someone commented about the rice serving - the rice was in it's own separate same-sized rectangular carton.  It was a solid amount for the two dishes.  Were the dishes spicy hot as I requested - far from it.  Obviously throwing in hundreds of dried red peppers has some heat, but it was far from Xtra hot or \"Szechaun hot\".  I have a lot left over as it is a little much to stomach dried chicken with a whole host of dried peppers.  I will have to utilize this stuff as some part of some dish where I add some vegi's and sauce. It will require a little bit of work.  Disappointing.  I will go back sometime and try something that specifically says \"in sauce\" and/or says \"w. vegetable\"."}
{"text":"Mongolian beef was excellent. The General Tso's wasn't what I'm used to, but it wasn't bad. Chicken with cashews was okay. I'm looking forward to trying other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese food I've had in Cleveland. Nice decor, very fast service. Had the jasmine bubble tea which was a bit sweet and milk based- fresh bubbles (tapioca) which was nice. The menu had a lot to chose from- we had the seczhuan chili chicken which was SPICY but very tasty & fried. The beef & vegetable pot was excellent- less spicy than the chicken but very good. Nice portion size- we had plenty of leftovers. Can't wait to go back & try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving. From the outside it looks a little rough but on the inside it has a welcoming feel. The staff is friendly and the food is great. Highly recommend the three-pepper chicken! A little spicy but not overwhelming. Plenty of parking and if you're interested there is a Asian grocery store right next door.   Side note: to go orders are prepared fairly quickly, but always make sure you're calling the Cleveland location."}
{"text":"My favorite for authentic Chinese food. I always get two dishes the spicy fish and pork with mushrooms and bamboo. Inside is not bad and service is ok, but the servers barely speak English )"}
{"text":"This place is addicting. After coming here, I don't even have the urge to go to Wonton Gourmet again. I've had a variety of dishes here, including the water boiled fish, lazi gi (szeuchan fried chicken), mapo tofu, rabbit dry pot, szechuan green beans, pepper lamb, tripe in chili oil, etc. It's all super good. The service here is really good. The first time I came here, it was just me and my bf, and the owner came to our table and talked to us. He even helped me order in Chinese (which is not my native language LOL and I probably sucked at it). When I came here with a larger group, we got less attention from the manager but our food was still fantastic. Everything comes out pretty fast too. The amount of food is overwhelming, and the price is very reasonable. I would definitely recommend coming here super hungry. Also, the food is SOOOO spicy, it will probably mess with your GI system if you're not used to it. This is totally worth it in my opinion. YOLO!!"}
{"text":"Limited by holidays, this little place was the only spot open today. The AC must have been broken, as it was 80 outside and 90 inside. I ordered the Szechuan Beef, but the waitress had \"never heard of that.\" It took a manager to get my order in, and still the two friends with me got their food and I never got mine. I just about changed my mind when I tried their chicken and discovered it to be full of bones, but I was too hungry to not eat.  The wonton soup was delicious, and the Szechuan beef was decent when I finally got it. I wanted brown or fried rice but they didn't have it. Probably won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Awesome foods!!! I came from China and live in PA, and I would say it is as good as those best Chinese restaurants in the east coast, Some can even beat those in china"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on the way out of town for a quick lunch. Our first choice was closed and this was close so we decided to give it a try. Glad we did as we were pleasantly surprised how delicious the food was. We especially enjoyed the three pepper chicken, steamed fish with vegetables and chengdu fried rice. The only weak dish was some dumplings we ordered to try which we found kind of bland. If we are ever in the neighborhood again, would definitely stop in for another meal."}
{"text":"Actual sichuanese food in Ohio?!?!  I'm pretty impressed.    It's pretty spicy and oily, as sichuanese food goes, so be prepared.  Sichuanese peppercorns and capsicum spices are not for the faint of heart.  Bring a group."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place for the authentic Szechuan style cooking, however the service is pretty rough.  I had to ask for water 3 times before they refilled it- not pleasant when your mouth is on fire from chile peppers."}
{"text":"Szechuan Gourmet is my all time favourite venue for chinese/hakka cuisine and for 3 main reasons:   1. The FOOD has always been overwhelmingly good. The combination of flavours and textures that the chefs are able to produce are second to none. From the soup to the fortune cookie, I am always blown away by the party in my mouth.   2. The SERVICE is sometimes so good it seems uncharacteristic for a hakka style venue. Nowhere have I experienced better service from not just our waiter but each and every member of the staff.   3. Each and every time I eat here I know what I want and I know exactly what I will get, this is due to the CONSISTENCY that SG thrives on. I can confidently say that if I were to hit up SG every day for a month and order the crispy ginger chicken every day, it will taste the exact same, every day. I feel that this restaurant's consistency is in direct correlation to the success they have endured over many many years.   Now let's talk food...   The hot and sour soup here will most likely be the best you have ever tried, some add a splash of chili vinegar for an extra zing. The crab corn is also so damn satisfying. I always put in a splash of soya sauce and red chili oil to take it to that next level.   The crispy ginger chicken will blow you clear out of the water, the flavour and texture leave me starstruck with every piece. I would recommend paying the extra $2.00 for white chicken only, but if you're not picky just order it up as is and enjoy the ride.   The crispy shredded beef is similar to the ginger chicken as the flavour and texture will really have your tastebuds doing back flips and jumping jacks. It's sweet, savoury, crunchy and satisfying with every morsel.   The chili chicken here is different from most places I have ever had. Some may be used to the dark brown gravy and small pieces of gooey chicken at most other hakka restaurants, but SG's boasts generous chunks of chicken completely riddled with red chili and caramelized onions.   The hakka noodles (house special) are a must if you're a noodle aficionado. Their rice noodle w/ black bean beef is also well delicious (I'm a texture slut, so rice noodles are always a must for me @ SG despite them not being very hakka-esque)   I could go on and on with dishes like the Peanut Chicken, Sizzling Shrimp and Spicy Spare Garlic Ribs, but yo just need to go and experience it for yourself.   This is hands down one of my favourite restaurants."}
{"text":"Usually a pretty good dinner. But last night I ordered curry chicken. Was absolutely awful. Tasted pre cooked, dry and very poorly prepared.  Most dishes here are good. But this was awful. Never ordering that again. They should either fix this dish or take it off the menu."}
{"text":"I am Chinese and recently moved to Cleveland.   My Chinese friends all like this place, so I decided to give a try.  I ordered tea smoked duck, well, it was not fresh.  The tea was very bland and lukewarm.  The other two appetizers were just so so.   I will not go back for sure."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best authentic Sichuan food I've ever had, eclipsing even the Sichuan restaurants I've tried in San Francisco's chinatown. Service can be a little slow (though not frustratingly so), but your patience will be rewarded. Dishes feature the trademark chili-oil-slick and spicy-yet-numbing taste of Sichuan food - which may sound undesirable if you're not familiar with authentic Sichuan cuisine, but I assure you these are marks of quality so don't be afraid to dive right in. Even the complimentary hot tea is a strong, earthy, authentic Pu-Erh which I could drink by the pot if given the opportunity. Prices are also very reasonable, so there's no excuse not to throw caution to the wind and try an appetizer or two, or an interesting-looking dish that you may not be able to pronounce. This place is absolutely one of very few Cleveland restaurants I would legitimately call diamonds-in-the-rough. A trip to Szechuan Gourmet is much cheaper than a plane ticket to China, but you'll swear you're there from the very first bite."}
{"text":"This is the best place in the north part of the GTA for Chinese food.  It is a  Small restaurant but definitely worth the wait.  However they have very little \"bed side manner\" because they need you to eat and leave.  That would be the only negative thing I have to say about this place.  Some tables are too small, and if you go as a twosome, you have to make sure to fight for a table bigger than a napkin.  Especially when ordering more than 1 or 2 dishes.  But the food is absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"The food is served so fast!! And is absolutely  a lot...Much more than in France haha..??? is the best for me, also ?????Their lunch special is very tastety and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy about this local and authentic restaurant, but I would rate it as one of the best meals of my life. A friend and I shared dry pepper chicken, garlic eggplant, green beans, and dumplings. I am drooling just thinking about them! Flavorful and authentic - the friend is currently in China and says she is often reminded of our meal here. I will be back and begging everyone to come with me as often as possible."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good reviews but I just don't get it. I ordered Mongolian beef that was exceptionally bland. What it lacked in flavor it made up for in grease (being way more greasy than typically Chinese food. Further a lot of the chicken dishes had bits of bone in the chicken making the entire process a choking hazard. Further, the wait staff was less than attentive."}
{"text":"Went on a double-date to Szechuan, and a dish-sharing arrangement was proposed. Yeah, why not?  For a guy traveling from B-town, this place is ridiculously out of the way, and crammed into a small run-down plaza, but would it be worth the drive?  The inside is average. Nothing flashy whatsoever, but clean, and the servers are all kind.  None of us went for the seemingly notorious ginger chicken, but from what I can recall, the sweet and sour chicken balls, the fried dumplings, the chicken thing my gal ordered, and the crispy beef were all delicious, served fast, and priced right.  I'd love to return, though I wish it was located much closer to me."}
{"text":"Can't praise Szechwan Gourmet restaurant enough! Delicious food and fast service it never disappoints. The servers are pleasant and helpful. The quality and taste of the food is always consistent, fabulous chefs here.  Our normal order consists of chicken fried rice, Hakka chowmein, crispy ginger beef and sizzling shrimp. However, I'm positive that nothing on the menu would disappoint! The food is always fresh tasting and arrives quite quickly to the table. If I lived nearby I would order takeout weekly I'm sure!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Chinese restaurant in Cleveland.   I love coming here with either a huge group of friends to take advantage of the karoke rooms (feels just like you're in China), or just with a friend or two for a late night snack. Their food is always authentic and the service is so FREAKING fast.   One time, my co-workers and I were so hungry that we called ahead while we were in the car (about 5-6 minutes away), ordered and when we got to the restaurant, our food was sitting waiting for us. Piping hot and delicious (as always).   The owner is especially nice and takes good care of his customers. He always has good recommendations and really seems to have a genuine interest in the dining experience of his customers.   Best part is, if you pay with cash, you get 10% off your entire bill!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars... The chef is from Chengdu - and while perhaps not delectably balanced, the flavours are authentically Sichuan.  I would agree with Cory R that the servers are still figuring out service, but after a little tinkering they managed to get my party and another party to share a table given that they have precious few tables set for parties of two.  We ended up ordering Huiguorou, Malaxianggan, dandanmian, Bairou, mapo tofu... all very legit standards at a Sichuan restaurant.  We even asked the waiter why the menu was in traditional chinese.  His response - more chinese in CLE use traditional...  That said, the patrons were nearly all from the mainland...    Which tells you volumes.  Portion sizes are mainland-ish, and flavours as well.    I enjoyed the meal thoroughly, and will go back when I'm in the mood for this particular sort of food.  The decor is pedestrian, but  the place is more or less a hole in the wall.  They also have a karaoke room with an authentic east-asia karaoke song set.  Very impressed - and it's really without competition here."}
{"text":"Authentic...great portions...great service.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Oh yes, oh yes, this place deserves my highest rating of - SLAP MY ASS AND CALL ME SALLY!! Why you ask does this place deserve such a high regarded rating? A rating only reserved for the best of the best? Because, I fell in love here. Fell in love with the crispy shredded beef. Wow, oh wow.   i have never had anything quite like this beefy goodness. The platter showcased dark thin pieces of meat with some red pepper goodness mixed in. The meat glistened, like a ray from heaven. When you bite into the beef, it has this amazing crispy and almost sensual texture that just explodes with flavour in your mouth.   This beef you want to eat again and again just to try to capture all the flavours and subtle textures. You could seriously go into Szechuan and order a platter of this dish alone, and be in heaven.   Hakka - hell yes. I will be back. For the beef of course, but also to revisit the other chicken and shrimp dishes I sampled. The soups are worth a try too - the hot and sour is very complex in flavour. The chicken and corn soup is perfect in texture and taste.   Note that the menu is huge and can feel overwhelming. My suggestion would be to take Devan R with you, or to even ask one of the helpful staff. The service here is second to none."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food, with great vegetarian and vegan options.  The salt and pepper tofu was nicely crispy and flavorful. The string beans were salty and nicely cooked.  The food was very good but nothing I haven't had better elsewhere. The rice tasted of old water.  The staff was very friendly.  The decor is very strange, though. The trip to the bathroom, down a weird hall, was like something out of a nightmare."}
{"text":"AMAZING and worth the drive. Ginger crispy chicken with white meat, green beans, hot & sour soup. Hands down the best chinese food restaurant in Canada (and possibly even the US). Brought a friend from NY 3 years ago and she still raves about this place."}
{"text":"REVIEW UPDATE:  Forget my last review w/ the fish tofu hybrid!  Again, it is Szechuan food, so it will be spicy and oily. Drink that tea to help with the oil! It is SO flavorful...  Here are the must-get dishes:  - Lotus root and peanut (my FAV) - Kong xing tsai or dou miao (greens w/ garlic) - Spicy baked shrimp on a stick (not sure where it is on the menu). This can be SPICY. - Ma-po tofu (tofu with pork) - Spicy bean noodle - \"Water cooked fish\" - it is actually really really spicy  - Stir fried green beans with prickly ash (tongue numbing - careful) - Yu-shang eggplant if you like it - Dan dan mian, of course"}
{"text":"When Szechuan was still something Torontonians lined up for,  Henry's Hunan Place was the place to beat.  All of that great spicy/greasy goodness would just rip the taste buds off your tongue. I still miss it.  But Szechuan Gourmet may be the closest thing there is.     We picked three of the most commonly found Szechuan favourites: Crispy Ginger beef, Wonton with Peanut Sauce and General Tsao's Chicken. All were among the best versions of those dishes we've ever had.  (And we've been eating Szechy since you were a baby!)   Two items that weren't as up to snuff were the Hot & Sour soup and the fried green beans.   Hot & Sour soup was quite peppery, but the broth itself was tasted kinda stale and overcooked.   The beans were also kinda tired and had been in contact with the grease for too long.  I'm withholding a star for those misses, but will be back whenever I'm in the neighbourhood and not counting calories. Thanks Yelpers for another great recommendation."}
{"text":"I have been to Szechuan Gourmet so many times. It is not a place for Americanized Chinese food, you won't find Crab Rangoon or sweet and sour soup (well, they probably do, but please don't order it from here, doesn't worth it), it is a place for somewhat real Chinese food, especially if you love Szechuan food and love something spicy and tasty!   Well, as a general guideline, when you want to know if a Chinese food place is good, check how many Chinese are eating there. Since Szechuan Gourmet is always packed with Chinese people who are from China, that says enough.  Things to recommend: Any dry pot dishes, Spicy Beef Slices, Hot pepper Fish Fillet, they also have a BBQ lamb on their special menu, if you love Chinese BBQ, ask for that! It has a cumin taste in it, really good.    Also, it is the only place offering \"Hot Pot\" in Cleveland! Yes, the only place to offer Hot Pot. Hot Pot is a type of food where you cook everything in a broth on the table fresh and dip them in a special sauce. I've been trying to find a hot pot place in Ohio for so long, they only had it in Cincinnati before. I'm really glad they start to offer it here in Cleveland. But you have to ask for the menu and they only offers it when they are not busy, so one star down for that."}
{"text":"Very good food. Waiter checked gluten for us. Very happy. ????? ?????????????????????"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this place since they took over the restaurant from the previous, Tink Holl Seafood. I've enjoyed Szechuan Gourmet and have been one of its biggest cheerleaders. I still enjoy the place but it has been inconsistent for the past 6 or 8 months. For example, the Lotus Root and Peanut dish is sometimes prepared with a generous amount of ginger and Szechuan pepper corns. Other times it arrives to the table lacking garlic, ginger and peppercorns. The Garlic Eggplant is usually my most favorite version of this dish but sometimes of late it arrives without its usual punch. Same for many other dishes. The good news is even when Szechuan Gourmet's dishes aren't up to their usual level they are still really good dishes but it's a disappointment when they aren't as good as usual. I've tried to express this at the restaurant but it seems to fall on deaf ears. My hope is that this Yelp review will help them pay more attention."}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch and the restaurant was very quiet. Friendly and fast service. We ordered noodles, house fried rice, ginger and onion shrimp, crispy ginger chicken and the green beans. Everything was tasty but overall the food is too salty and greasy. The best dish was probably the chicken, nice crispy outside and tender inside. I would have skipped the noodles, they were too saucy and didn't have much to offer. Also the entrée dishes were spicy, as expected- just a warning if you don't like spicy food. Decent choice for Chinese food in the area and not too excpensive. Personally I need to go outside of Thornhill to get good Asian food haha."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite spot for some Chinese comfort food in Cleveland! I'm a huge fan of spicy food, and this place does it right :) The entrance to the restaurant may a little confusing to find. As soon as you turn into 36th street from Payne, look for a parking lot within some metal fences! You won't miss the extravagant sign!  I love coming here with a huge group of friends, so we can reserve the private rooms and order a million dishes to be shared family style! My favorite dishes are the szechuan style fried chicken, eggplant with garlic, Fuqifeipian, boiled fish and boiled beef. If you've never ordered the Dry Pot before, you HAVE to try it! Basically, it's a $20 put with a mix of up to 5 choices of meat and veggies. It's super spicy and super delicious! All of the dishes at this restaurant pair extremely well with a side of refreshing TsingTao beer!   The owner and servers here are also very friendly and attentive. If you want to save 10% on your order, make sure you bring cash to pay for your food!   I definitely recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Another asiatown winner. If the best chinese restaurant near me served the worst thing on Szechuan gourmet's menu;I would go all the time."}
{"text":"General Tso's Chicken was pretty good.  These guys give you unlimited rice with your meal which is pretty cool.  Unfortunately, my friend ordered a dish off the special menu and wasn't really impressed; which is the reason for my four star review."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place searching for something \"szechuan\" to satisfy my craving, though this wasn't a place that served boiled fish in chili soup or anything, it certainly exceeded my expectations!   4 star simply because the food is a bit salty for my palate (will ask for less next time). Service was impeccable. Conversed with multiple waiters in both mandarin and English, and they were always gracious. Restaurant ambiance was nice and cozy so no reservations/rushing  (only half full on a Saturday night).  Lastly, the food! Everything i ordered was done so well. The hot and sour soup is one of the best I've had (excellent consistency and blend of flavours). The crispy shredded beef is to die for, a little sweet, just the right amount of spicy and perfectly crunchy. Took half home to stir fry with some green bean which made it even better! Also had eggplant in garlic sauce which was mushier than your typical Chinese restaurant but worked out well. All dishes are reasonably priced and large enough to share with a party of 5-6; with 3, I definitely had enough leftovers.   Super happy I found this place as it's close to my home too. I will return!"}
{"text":"we are regular customer,s at this restaurant ,Tonight we ordered the usual, our favourte dish is peanut chicken,we brought our three dish,s home and upon opening the chicken we saw half the dish was peanut sauce and less than half the usual amount of chicken,I called the restaurant and spoke to the owner for ten minutes,she insisted that it was made the same as always, It was not at all, we paid 11,95 for peanut sauce and a small amount of chicken,, The arrogant owner could not care less ,refusing to credit us for next time we picked up, or d delivering a new dish to our home,This place the staff is unfriendly, not well mannered, and horrible customer service, and the food was awful ,except for the fried rice, it was good,If your looking for bad service this is the place to go, the customer is never right,, be warned,"}
{"text":"Crispy Ginger Chicken and the House Special Fried Rice..."}
{"text":"It's really hard to believe that such a good Sichuan restaurant exists right here in Cleveland. This is the real deal. Ask for spicy and you will begin to know what real Sichuan cuisine tastes like. This place is awesome. Never disappoints."}
{"text":"Since I moved to Cleveland last year, I've been searching for good Chinese food. A couple places have been alright, but I hadn't found one that blew me away...until now.  Szechuan Gourmet is my favourite kind of Chinese food. Unforgiving, unadulterated and uncompromising szechuan spice. It makes me incredibly happy to have finally found a spot that is authentic and does not water down its dishes for non-Chinese palates. I ordered an eggplant dish, the chili chicken and dried pot fish. Each one was excellent and the serving size was so large, I had enough food for my next 3 meals!  I cannot recommend this place more. I have found great Chinese in Cleveland after all!"}
{"text":"Service is great here and the food is out of this world. You should try the Chicken with Bamboo Shoots or the General Tso Chicken. This is the one of the best places to come and eat in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is one of my all-time favourite restaurants.  The chilli chicken and crispy ginger beef is out of this world!  Their hakka style house special friend noodles are another favourite of mine.  I usually order delivery, but every time I've dined in, the service has been stellar.  Prices are reasonable...but I would gladly pay more because the flavours are awesome!"}
{"text":"I was ready for this seedy-looking restaurant (from the outside) next to a Chinese grocery to wow my dad and I. I wasn't expecting it to be priced so highly. But if you go with the right people and pick the right dishes, you could be paying for two meals at the same time.  A note on payment before I continue: while they accept card, the cash price is 10% off your meal. It might be worth your while to stop by the ATM first!  The immediate proximity of ethnic grocery stores is usually a pretty good place to start looking for authentic cuisine. My dad saw the word \"Szechuan\" and instantly began looking for ????, or Husband and Wife's Sliced Lung translated literally. On the menu is a more accurate description of the dish, Beef Tripe and Tendon w/ Chili Sauce (it also has peanuts). This is a classic cold appetizer, and according to him, is how you judge the authenticity of a self-proclaimed Szechuan restaurant. After that, we were a little bit at a loss because of how extensive the menu is. Their favorites menu (with pictures) and a waiter helped narrow it down a little, and we ended up with Seaweed Soup w/ Dried Shrimp and Winter Melons, Ground Pork w/ Cellophane Noodles, and Three-Style Pepper Chicken. The last one was by far our favorite - a bunch of crispy, chewy popcorn-chicken-sized bites of meat. The pepper to chicken ratio actually approaches 1:1, and first timers should watch out for the little Szechuan peppercorns. If you've never experienced the numbing effects of peppercorns, I suppose now would be the time to try. We were pretty disappointed by the Ground Pork (????) since it was just kind of a glob of spices, noodles, and pork without much complexity. The soup was perfect for quelling the fire in our mouths and bellies, as was our oolong tea.   I mentioned that it was seedy outside. The ambience is only a few levels above inside, but there's actually plenty of seating and even a TV playing Chinese pop music videos. Sold yet? :P We saw quite the diverse mix of students, businessmen, and native Chinese people during dinner time. Naturally, the waiters had to speak both Chinese and English for such an audience. They were really attentive, making laps every few minutes. And I don't know if the kitchen is cheating or what, but our dishes came out SUPER fast and still tasted like a Szechuan grandmother's kitchen.   My dad gave his endorsement to Szechuan Gourmet, and I expect to be introducing some of my friends here soon. Maybe even trying the hot pot advertised. I'll be needing some of that fire in my belly come winter!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Affordable. Clean. Friendly. Huge portions. Old standbys and plenty of rarer menu items. Coming back."}
{"text":"Slippage..  everything is way too greasy and they skimped on the shrimp in my noodle dish. I'm convinced the entire GTA when it comes to good Chinese food has their head up their ass. Restaurants are either too authentic that the food is unpalatable or too westernized for the Gui lau crowd. Why can't someone open a restaurant and hire a chef who prepares quality proteins with great wok hay and uses an abundance of garlic, chill and ginger where the food isn't doused in grease. Oh I have to move to LA or Vancouver for that..."}
{"text":"Extremely authentic Asian food. I got the spicy beef noodle soup and the beef was really juicy and full of flavor - not dry. The spicy wontons were so good too. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Every time i go to cleveland this is must go chinese restaurant for me!! I Love their food!! Def should try this place out if u never before!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite chinese restaurant. Must try the crispy ginger chicken and the shrimp fried noodles."}
{"text":"Finally after reading reviews on yelp for a few days and thinking about this place I decided to give it a try. Based off of what some people said on yelp I decided to go with the mapo tofu dish with minced pork and for a appetizer I got wontons in a spicy sauce. Ok so here is my review. I walk in get seated really fast. As I'm walking I notice three employees just chilling at a table cutting the ends of green beans off in my opinion this is normal I've seen it down elsewhere. I get handed two menus that are pretty big (was aware based off of other yelpers the menu was huge) I decided on the mapo tofu and the wontons as previously mentioned. I was on my phone wasting some time waiting for my food took a sip of water and was wondering why it does not taste the greatest but I chalked that up to being Cleveland city water lol. All of a sudden my tofu dish comes to my table and a small and I mean very small bowl of rice comes with it. I think they should give you a lot more rice then they do I mean come on its cheap. I'm left sitting here wondering if I will get my \"appetizer\" as I got my lunch entrée first. 5 minutes later here comes my noodle wonton appetizer. Let me tell you what my noodle dish was 10x better then my tofu dish. The noodles were silky smooth flavorful in a nice balanced sauce consisting of soy vinager garlic ginger green onion sesame oil and chilies(this is what I assumed I tasted) The sauce was great although not very spicy. I would like to eat it again but I paid $5 and got about 6 wontons(yes I know it is considered a appetizer) Now on to my mapo tofu dish. Every one had good reviews on this dish so I decided to try it. This was the reason for my venture out from lake county. I was VERY disappointed. First and I'm not sure if all Szechuan cooking/food is like this but I had a crazy amount of oil on top of my food. Almost to the point I was grossed out. I had to mix my bowl up some. other then the oil issue there was some flavor in the dish if you mixed it up but not a whole lot. Before I ordered it I asked the waitress if there were actual Szechuan pepper corns in the dish and she just stared at me and said I don't know. I was hoping to have my taste buds pleasantly burned off but was I got was a very Americanized type of heat.(no trace of the prized numbing peppercorns) only hot enough to make my nose run. I did get a lot of food I took half of my tofu dish home. I THINK I might come back and try something else based off yelp to make my final decision but I will not be going back for a while. Maybe next year or something. Over all I chose to give this place only 3 stars and that was because the noodle wonton dish has some great flavor to it and it made me happy.  I left paying $16.09 I gave the guy 20.09 and he sat there for a few trying to figure out my change as I let him know it was $4 due back. I understand he might not understand currency or English and I will not judge a person for that. Please do not let my review decide whether or not you will try this place out but let it serve as a warning on the tofu dish in regards to the oil.(I was worried I needed to get home asap as the oil might run through me lol)"}
{"text":"This place has really authentic Chinese food! I am not a huge spicy eater but they cooked it in mild upon our request. Was still a little spicy to us but food was fantastic. Had loofah with mushrooms, three pepper chicken, and water spoiled fillet/fish. Loved them all!!! Service was attentive as well. Would totally return if I am around!!"}
{"text":"Quality restaurant but you need to go behind the building for the entrance on 36th. The twice cooked pork is very good."}
{"text":"Don't let the location (it's a little seedy) fool you, this is some good szechuan chinese take out.  Personally I was hovering between giving 3 or 4 stars because my fiances General Tso's was pretty soggy and dismal, and the fried rice was a little on the salty side.    However I ordered the Szechuan dry pepper chicken with peanut and it had such a perfect balance of spice and flavor.  Now I like spicy food, if you don't have the constitution for spicy fare then I would recommend picking something else because it was literally covered in 3 different types of ground up dried chilis (seeds and all). Again, I thought it was great and the staff seemed very friendly both on the phone and in person.  I'm looking forward to getting more adventurous in the future and exploring their menu which was quite extensive."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Szechuan so I think I'm a fair judge of Szechuan cuisine. Most of the dishes here are authentically Szechuan. What makes this place authentic is their red chili oil which is used in almost all hot dishes. In fact Szechuan chili oil is not just chili and oil. It contains a mixture of different flavors extracted from spices herbs. Some so called Szechuan restaurants don't prepare the oil this way. But not this place! I'm pretty sure chefs at Szechuan prepare their red hot chili oil the traditional way because I can taste it and actually saw pieces of spices/herbs in the food."}
{"text":"Whoa this restaurant rocks! I love spicy food but sadly Americans seem to like sweet food  (even Chinese restaurants). This restaurant has great real-Chinese style dishes."}
{"text":"Authentic as it gets when it comes to Szechuan styled food! Large selection of entrees but quality is still very good.  I've been here a few times and the food does not disappoint. Food comes out amazingly fast!  Here are some of the dishes that were particularly good:  Dried red pepper (fried) fish filet - fish fillets were fried with a very light texture and was soft and moist on the inside - the dried peppers added a nice kick to the entire dish - slightly spicy and not too salty!  Sliced pork bean curd - thinly sliced marinated pork - super flavorful and tender - stir fried with bean curd sauce and small strips of bamboo shoots - comes with tofu paper which you can make use to wrap the pork and shoots  Singapore noodles - stir fired rice noodles with curry powder - great texture on the noodles that are lightly coated with eggs - the pork and shrimp was nicely seasoned as well  The restaurant is also conveniently located next to Tink Hall where you can pick up groceries after your meal!"}
{"text":"I've been getting food from here for as long as I can remember! Staff is helpful and friendly, and portions are very generous! I recommend the ginger chicken :)"}
{"text":"The food here was so good. We had the Szechuan chicken and the cumin beef, as well as scallion pancakes. Everything was so oily, which I enjoyed. It wasn't as spicy as I was hoping/expecting, but tasty nonetheless."}
{"text":"Kung pao chicken and 3 pepper chicken are great  Most dishes are on the spicy side so watch out."}
{"text":"After much difficulty to place an order, I picked it up and brought it back to work.  Take out with no utensils. Great.    Chow mein was lacking in quantity and taste.  Noodles weren't crunchy at all, but rather soggy.    Sweet and sour chicken balls were what saved this meal in my opinion.    Including the 3 pops ordered, the meal came up to approx. $28.00 wow. What a rip.    Also, I was a little peeved that they couldn't deliver as my order was just under $30.00"}
{"text":"Great food. Never been disappointed whether eating in or taking home. Delivery is fast and they offer 10% discount if you pick up your order."}
{"text":"Ordered Sichuan dried pepper chicken. I have ordered it several times in the past. It was always boneless. Today they served me chicken with pieces of bone included. And they were not regular chicken bones. They were pieces of the joints of a chicken. There was no meat. I paid $14.00 for bones. I was extremely disappointed. I used to love this place but if they are trying to run customers away they are succeeding."}
{"text":"The food is authentic and crazy delicious. This place did not disappoint! Tried the sauteed lamb and several of their fish dishes, all were amazing. Food came out fairly quickly too. I would probably eat here every day, if I could."}
{"text":"The food was great! I had a fish in a spicy hot oil. It really tasted like I had imagined :)  The waiter was very friendly and nice :) he always had a smile on his face and very courteous"}
{"text":"Chuan. Chuan. Chuan. Sorry I thought you told me to say \"Chuan.\"  George W Bush won't like this review... but \"Gore may.\"  SG is a lovely place making decent lamb cumin. It wasn't amazing so I can't give it 5 stars and it was pretty pricy, but I did like the excellent service, and lovely decor.  The food was pretty good with an extensive, authentic menu. Not to mention the fact that they quickly changed a $100 bill for me, which not a lot of people would have done. And there's not a huge amount of authentic Asian stuff in Cleveland, so it's cool to have this place on the menu of possibilities.  At $13 it's competitively priced too (some places charge $20 for Cumin Lamb), but I only ate about a quarter of it, so that's why this review may sound like a 5 star effort, but is actually getting 4.  As for tonight, you're actually getting 8."}
{"text":"WOW!!! Amazing food I must say, and prompt service would be an understatement. The food was brought out in 5 mins.  Anyway. The black tea bubble tea was great and so was the lamb with cumin. I did not care much for the dan dan noodles with pork or dumplings in spicy sauce. They were not bad, but the other foods were so amazing I did not eat more than a taste.  Do order their fish with vegetables and pepper, you won't regret it. Their dry hot pot was also pretty spicy and flavorful. The flavors came out just right and it was the right kind of spicy.  They do give rice with sides so you don't have to bother about that. They have a grocery store right beside it :)  They have parking and a definitely must try if you are around Cleveland downtown and into Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place is the Bomb!!! Yelp never fails me when I travel for work. Being from the NYC- this place rivals some of the finer Chinese Restaurants in Manhattans' Chinatown & downtown Flushing ( Queens ) and San Franciso as well.  There is one particular Fish dish that I get here that is dynamic- The Fish is steamed perfectly. The vegetables were crunchy fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"I stumbled onto this place while searching for a different restaurant. It actually exceeded my expectations. The waitstaff was very friendly and gave me great suggestions for dinner. The price wasn't too expensive, but there was so much food left over that it was definitely worth the cost. The waiter was hovering at times, but it looked like he was just trying to make sure we didn't have to wait to ask for anything. The restaurant is quite loud, but great overall.  The Lemon Chicken Dinner is great, a little too saucy for me though.  The Hot and Sour soup is definitely not something that I enjoyed, but it seemed to be made well.  The vegetable spring roll was DELICIOUS!  My boyfriend got the vegetable fried rice, which was good, nothing memorable about it though.  And the Beef Broccoli dinner, it also looked really saucy, but cooked well."}
{"text":"This was a very delicious hot pot place in Cleveland. The food came out promptly, it was spicy and tasty. The beer was cold and atmosphere nice. If you are interested in traditional chinese food this is the place to visit! They know how to make meals right."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the negative reviews, it sucks you had bad service, but please give it another try, it's a new restaurant with possibly inexperienced managers.  This food here is the most authentic in Cleveland. So says my wife who spent the first 22 years of her life in China. I had the Spicy Pork Intestine soup and it was amazing. The spice mix was as good as a restaurant that I have been to that is in the top 50 in the US.  For the person complaining about bones, wanting fried rice, and wanting American Chinese dishes, yes, go to a cookie cutter American Chinese place. This is not your typical take-out Chinese place. If you want to try something new and really good, come here. In my experience, Chinese restaurants cook much higher quality food when you order authentic.  I also recommend the Spicy White Fish dish for another solid dish that is more accessible. We also had a chicken dish that I can't remember the name of, but it was too salty for my taste. Normally I would take off a star for that, but compared to all the other Chinese restaurants in Cleveland, the other two dishes amazed me enough to still give this place 5 stars. We had great service too."}
{"text":"Szechuan Gourmet adds to the list of great reasons to visit Cleveland's fantastic and growing Asiatown community.  This new-ish Chinese restaurant is next door to the Tink Hall Asian market and makes a convenient place to eat, then shop.  Being Szechuan style, many of the dishes have \"heat\" spiced with dried red peppers and hot oils.  They do have dishes that are milder for those that do not enjoy flame on their tongues!  Overall, I recommend the restaurant and will be back -- just be armed with plenty of water and all is well.  We had a larger party of 14 (including kids) and just barely fit into their tiny party room.  One advantage of eating with a large group is being able to order many varieties of dishes to share family-style (the ONLY way to eat at traditional Chinese restaurants is to share - thus the convenient rotating \"lazy-susan\" table top).    I'll post photos of most of our dishes: 1. Fish Dried Pot (O1) - my favorite dish of the evening.  It has fried fish that is mixed with veggies, herbs, and a ton of peppers.  Very Good.  Recommended. 2. Beef Dried Pot (O1) - Good, but not as good as the above. 3. Seaweed Soup with dry shrimp and winter melon (E7) - tasty start of the meal. 4. Dried mushrooms (that are reconstituted) with Bok Choy (V6) - I love traditional Chinese mushrooms -- delicious. 5. Eggplant in Garlic Sauce (T3) - cooked just right.  The eggplant was not overcooked so it was not mushy. 6. Veggie dish - ask the server what good veggies are available.  They did not have good stock of Gai Lan (my fav - Chinese broccoli) but he recommended Dow Mew (snow pea leaves - my second fav). 7. Shrimp Ho Fun (wide rice noodles - G18) -   I usually get beef dry fried, but this was a good change. 8. Minced Pork with Cellophane noodles (T13) - It was good - loaded with spicy sauce. 9. Spicy lamb with Chilli pepper (M35) - haha.  Most of the dishes have plenty of chilli peppers - I guess this one gets extra. 10. Seafood Tofu (T9) - hard to go wrong with tofu.  Yum.  Non-spicy. 11. Chicken with Broccoli (M4) - This may sound generic, but it was tasty.  Also it was good to give our taste buds a rest from the heat with a few non-spicy dishes. 12. Chicken with bamboo shoots (U3 ??) - the only so-so dish.   Yeah, we ate a lot!  Thoroughly enjoyed sharing the meal with friends and family.  Bring a group to Szechuan Gourmet (or any Chinese place) and share/try new  authentic foods family-style.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Now this is an authentic restaurant. Very good and they do not Americanize the spicy food scale. I am addicted to the dan dan noodles and steam buns. Szechuan Gourmet is a consistently pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Yum!  My husband and I were on the east side and decided to try out a new restaurant. With a quick search on Yelp! I found that we were close to Asia Town and that the closest restaurant, Szechuan Gourmet, had great reviews. Everyone else is spot on regarding the location. When we pulled up we agreed that without reading the Yelp! reviews we wouldn't have ever wandered into this gem.   The restaurant was clean and staff were very friendly. There were only choptsticks at the table, but they brought us forks without even asking. (Not that I needed one...) The menu is extensive and there are so many dishes I have never even heard of. My husband decided on sesame chicken while I chose a tofu & pork dish. We also ordered crab ragoon. Both dishes came with lots of white rice and everything was hot, delicious and fresh. We took home a ton of leftovers and I was so excited to eat them for lunch the next day!   If you're in the area or just in the mood for Szechuan food, this is a great option!"}
{"text":"If you love hot and tasty Chinese food, this is the place to go in Cleveland! Loved their lamb skewers, dry pot, wonton and green beans. It was recommended to me by a friend from Beijing who has combed through Cleveland looking for Asian foods."}
{"text":"The food might be tasty, but this restaurant has some questionable health/sanitation practices.  The first time I came here, one of my friends got light food poisoning.  We passed it off as just a chance occurrence though and still agreed that the restaurant served up some delicious and flavorful food.    Recently, we went back and saw some questionable things that will now cause us to never visit this restaurant again.  One of their highlight items is the fish dry hot pot, which the owner told us they use fresh fish - \"catfish\", which is in reality basa fish to be precise.  We were a party of five in the restaurant on a pretty late weekday night where there were few customers, and we ordered this item.  After waiting about 10 minutes after placing our order, I went and sat by the front desk area to make a phone call.  It just so happened that I was right in view of the fish and lobster tank - basa fish to be precise, aka exactly what goes into the fish dry hot pot that we ordered.   What I saw disturbed me - there was a dead and decomposing fish in the tank that the other fish were beginning to eat.  But what I saw after a few minutes absolutely scared the sh** out of me - the chef came out with a net and container and crouched down by the fish tank.  Since we were the only ones in the restaurant at that time that had placed an order (other tables were already eating), I knew this fish was going to go into our dish.  And sure enough...after a couple seconds of looking, the chef scooped up the ONE DEAD FISH out of at least twenty and went back to the kitchen.  In summary, this restaurant will scoop up a dead and decomposing fish right in front of customers and serve it to them.  What do you think they do behind customers' backs in terms of reusing frying oil, sanitation, expired meat, dairy, produce, etc?  I hope you have enough information now to draw your own conclusions."}
{"text":"My favorite in Cleveland. I've tried the mapo tofu, rabbit dry pot, twice cooked pork, and my favorite: spicy fried pig intestines. Each was super flavorful in their own way, and the leftovers make the best brunch ever.   The service is also quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a few people from work. All four of us enjoyed our meal. Will make this a frequent stop for lunch in the future."}
{"text":"Going to give it 5 stars. Was home for Christmas. Love the Szechuan Gourmet in Ny & Flushing, Queens. Had no idea there was one in Cleveland. I was skeptical at first but the reviews, photos, & menu items sounded legit so i made a reservation for me & my family who is not familiar with authentic Szechuan food. We were seated right away. It wasn't horribly busy so there was always a server available to get us anything we needed. I ordered for everyone. Szechuan dumplings, dan dan noodle, mapu tofu, spicy cucumber, pickled vegetable, fried green peppers (huge fan), jelly noodle with spicy bean sauce (awesome but gelatinous) , tripe in spicy sauce (i always order this), spicy green beans ( great complimentary veg to go with everything else), fried frog leg pot, & spicy boiled fish pot (fish pot was excellent). Everything was legit. This stood up very well to the authentic places in nyc. It's obvious the chefs know what's up. My family was thinking everything would be too hot, or too \"weird\", but they were pleasantly surprised with the flavors & the manageable heat. They did sweat a little but they basically were able to manage it with water & rice. Haha. I don't need rice. I want all the flavor & spice. No filler. So happy i can get my Szechuan fix when i come home. If you need advice ordering here, use my order as a guide. Don't get run of the mill Chinese here. I guess if you're new to this, the jelly noodle & tripe texture may be too much, or the fried green peppers may be overbearing but i love it. Enjoy, this place is the best in Cleveland as far as i know. Will be back for the Hotpot! Shout out to the staff, they took care us."}
{"text":"Went around the town looking for a place that would open at 9:30 and this is the only one who would be nice enough to accept clients even tho they close at 10. But anyways. The food is amazing tho its disappointing i couldn't taste the eggplant that was shown thru yelp pics. But cant blame them, most restaurants would clean the kitchen at that time."}
{"text":"I'm just a suburbanite from Cleveland, Ohio so what do I really know about \"authentic\" Chinese food? Admittedly, not much, but if you're idea of Chinese Food is Panda Express, Mark Pi, or anything else that you may find at the mall food court, then it might be time to expand your horizons a bit and check out some \"real\" Chinese.  Szechuan Gourmet has some of the best menu selections. Sure, you can have orange chicken, or Hunan beef, or Kung Pao this or that, but if you're willing to take a chance and dive a little deeper, your senses and taste buds will be introduced to a whole new level of Chinese food at Szechuan Gourmet. Dry pot chicken, for example, is one of the best chicken dishes I have ever tasted. It's spicy, but not just for the sake of being spicy. The spices and peppers incorporated into the dish provide a tremendous palate pleasing experience. Another dish that I absolutely love is the Boiled Fish in spicy Szechuan sauce. Delectable pieces of tilapia filets boiled in exactly that, a spicy Szechuan sauce, with cabbage and other veggies stewing at the bottom of the bowl.   Most dishes are meant to be enjoyed \"family style\" with portions big enough for at least two; maybe three. I usually go with a friend or two and select a main dish and a vegetable to be shared with the table. I've never left hungry.   It's a little off the beaten path, and you may have your trepidations walking in, but I promise you that once the food starts coming, those fears will be lost to a distant memory and you'll be enjoying some of the best Chinese food that you've ever had in the CLE."}
{"text":"I have just given birth to a 7 lb. food baby named Crispy Ginger Chicken. At least it feels like I've eaten that much crispy ginger chicken. It was an all hail to the Hakka night up on Steeles Avenue West where a bunch of Yelpers and Devan R's wingers joined in for pure Hakka food debauchery.   There really isn't much more to add to what the previous yelpers and fellow attendees have written. I say, oh yeah, uh huh, that's right and ditto. Even Susan \"Where's the lazy Susan?\" C. was impressed and that's saying something cause she ain't your average food gobbling broad.   Devan \"Eat it Or Leave it\" R....you da man. He told us to put down the menu's and step away from them. The Captain was on board and at the helm. Aye aye Captain. Our wish is your command. :) He adroitly instructed the waitstaff on what exactly to bring.   Note to self: Next time I'm out on a Yelp event and Devan R. is seated at a table, I want the seat next to one of my newest fave foodies at Yelp.   OK, so in the end, here's the Hakka low down. Go to Szechuan Gourmet Restaurant. Have the soup. Order the Crispy Ginger Chicken. Order the Crispy Beef with chili's. Order the sizzling Shrimps. Stuff yourself senselessly. Be sure to send out birth announcements after your meat baby is born."}
{"text":"I LOOOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!! From a southern Chinese customer, this is as authentic as it gets! Service is blunt and quick, great and consistent food each time. Try everything on the menu- guaranteed delicious. The waiters aren't always friendly but they get the job done and it's a busy place so can't blame them too much. They don't speak that much English but speak enough so you understand. Most dishes are spicy unless you specify or request certain preferences. Pretty much everything has MSG and salt.  There are also karaoke rooms in the back you can reserve for parties."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I would definitely recommend going here to do the Spicy Hot Pot! It tastes just like the stuff I had in China where it's drenched in chili, oil, and that pepper that numbs your mouth. If you can handle very spicy, I'd recommend making it a level 3. I had a level 2 and it wasn't that spicy, but for some, it might be intolerable."}
{"text":"The crispy ginger chicken was Bomb. Must get. The Shanghai noodle had some spice and good flavour. The sweet and sour chicken balls were better than expected with actual meat and it was crunchy. Chicken fried rice was not great. Chicken corn soup was horrible."}
{"text":"Wow! Wonton Gourmet and Hunan East have been my two favorite Chinese restaurant in Cleveland for the longest time I can remember. And there's a good chance that Szechuan Gourmet might just be my new favorite!  The first thing you should know before entering here is that their food is Szechuan style. If you don't know what that means, then you better prepare yourself for some heat and spice. Personally, I'm known to be a wuss when it comes to spice, but Szechuan's spice is more of a numbing tingling type of spice.. the type that for some reasons, many can't handle but I can.   If you are here for a group meal, here are dishes I'd recommend for the table in order of preferences:  Fu Qi Fei Pian (5): Beware! This is a cold dish that looks extremely spicy dripped in all the red sauce but it's surprisingly not too spicy. It's spicy beef and tripe and it will become the reason I will be at Szechuan Gourmet all the time.  Mapo Tofu (4.5): Wow.. Ever since I moved to Cleveland, I thought I made the best mapo (and I'm a terrible cook) and I finally found Szechuan's mapo tofu. The tofu is so delightful and I love how grounded the meat is!  Dried Fish Hot Pot (4) or  Spicy Fish/Shui Cho Yui (4): You have to order at least one of the these two. The difference is the first is fried fish and the order is steamed fish. Either way is boil into a pot of spice oil. They are both sooo good. Most people seem to like the dried fish hot pot although I personally prefer the Spicy Fish.  Watercress Vegetable (4): it's the best I've had Cleveland yet. Make sure you order it with garlic. Best stir fried watercress vegetable ever. And, with all the spicy dishes you've just ordered, you need something to help tone it down!  Huiguorou (4): Double Cooked pork. You can also order the \"Spicy Huiguorou\". Regardless, it's pretty much stir fry bacon with Chinese spice sauce. You know you can't go wrong with bacon anything!   Some not as good dishes: Green Beans (3) are delicious but every restaurant cooks it the same more or less. Scallion Pancake (3) is way too oily and I can buy it frozen and make it myself at home.  Either way, enjoy your meal at Szechuan if it's your first time!"}
{"text":"This place is more inconsistant than your bipolar ex-girlfriend  at the end of  3 day bender.  There are some tasty things on the menu. the issue is there are other things that are just plain bad. I am not sure why things like hofun are on the menu when they clearly have no clue as how prepare them. The girl whom i am dating advises that we ordered the wrong dish. I advised that if they can not make it right, leave it off the menu.  The dry pot was ok a bit greasy, the ginger spinich was very sour, the hot and sour soup was not good. I know that hot and sour soup is americanized but this was pretty bad.  Szechuan pepper corns are kind of cool.  If you are a gringo,this will be new. They make your mouth numb. Like could do dental work numb.   The service is quite bizzare. Bipolar as well. My lady advised a server that the soup was not good and take it off the  bill. when the it arrived the offending soup  was not removed from her bill. She asked the waitress whY it was not taken off the bill. The waitress told her to come back later when the manager was back. Wrong answer.  I took care of business.  when aking to take the food home,we had 3 things, she only brought one box. I look at her and said really. I was not taking any food home so i did not  say anything to ethe server.  Wow.  I am a bit wary of this place. 1 good meal, and 2 not so good."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food.  Luckily I went with two Chinese friends who eat here regularly.  The flavor profiles were complex and amazing.  We shared the lamb, chili chicken, fish, dry pot, and eggplant.  I do not know what any of the official names are and am worried about having to order myself.  But the food was incredible and if my friends aren't available my plan is to show the waiter pictures of food so can dine here quickly again.  Best Chinese food in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Service was friendly however, the communication barrier was a bit b of an issue.  Understandable in having authentic  szechuan food. The food was delicious but it v was hot,  hot,  hot and hot."}
{"text":"Between Ho Lee Chow and the take-no-prisoners style of Chinese dining in Markham, you'll find Szechuan Gourmet as a kind of bridge. They offer a pretty big menu, all your favorites are here, and there's the sweet 'n' sour chicken balls for the stick in the mud dining companion. I had the hunan beef (with a chili sign on the menu to indicate it was spicy). My companion had the pineapple chicken. She noted while looking at the menu \"I'm looking for something on this menu I can't cook.\" (Hmmm. Perky boobies, see photos, and a good cook? A keeper I think.)  Anyway, my friend wasn't super impressed. The pineapple chicken was too sweet in her opinion (I probably could have told her that) and I didn't find the beef worthy of its spicy warning.  The upshot is, you're not going to impress hardcore Chinese diners but then location location location is the tip off. It's on the North  end of \"Hymietown\", as the most Reverend and perennial presidential candidate Jessie Jackson was given to say. It's a decent enough place to challenge whitey.  The lunch menu seems to be available on weekends and it offers pretty good value."}
{"text":"There are so many different Chinese restaurants around it is hard to decide which one to try or where to go...  Szechuan is my favorite, their food is so good it is like being a little kid having some candy. They are VERY fast, I have never seen food cooked so fast in my life.  If you are looking for some fabulous Chinese food look no further, everyone should try this restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here with friends that are HUGE fans of this place.  They could be considered royalty they come so often.  They did the ordering and I just ate and observed.  The food comes out super quick and is very fresh.  The quality is good and the rice is fresh and tasty.  I think the rice quality is a big sign of the place.  As the dishes came out, we started gorging.  We started with an app of spicy chicken which was super tasty.  The main dishes started coming out one at a time and ended up filling the table.  The plates were flavorful and fresh.  So far, the review sounds like a 4 star, but my complaint of the place is that too much of the food is too Americanised (I guess Canadianized since I am in Canada) and fried.  The Shrimp was so battered up and oily that I didn't even finish the one I took to try.  I focused on the non-fried beef and chicken dishes with the sauces on the rice from some of the other dishes.  Very professional staff and high quality dishes are why I give it 3 stars and would come back to see what a non-fried experience would be like."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Though our food came out in rounds, which worked just fine since we were sharing, everything I ate was piping hot, fresh, and delightful. We had the three style pepper chicken, which was perfectly crispy with the right amount of heat and the eggplant with garlic which was cooked in the out of control sauce. We also had the chicken with three cups sauce; the whole cloves of molten roast garlic rocked my world. Basically, you can't go wrong with anything on their menu."}
{"text":"The food here is decent. The spice level was actually quite lower than what I was expecting. I ordered 3 star spicy and it wasn't that hot, but the flavor was there. The service was ok. The bathroom experience was something I am taking a star for. It was sooooo gross and foul smelling. The whole area by the bathroom was really disgusting. We did not have any problems communicating  with our waiter at all. Although it was good I wouldn't"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years. The food is always delicious. The place is small but it's definitely a reliable place in terms of what you can expect. I like it a lot. Shrimp and lobster sauce with rice is our fav!"}
{"text":"Oily and spicy Szechuan cuisine in abundance. Inspired and fresh dishes. You can't go wrong with the hot pot. Probably the best place in Asia town for a proper Chinese meal."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now with some Chinese friends and I gotta say it's a nice addition to CLE Chinese restaurants!  We got a few different dishes, but I'll admit both times my friends ordered.  I can definitely say the dishes are probably hit or miss and you need to know what to order here.  If you're not in the mood for spicy food, maybe you should stay away.  Most of the dishes I really liked were spicy and covered in peppers MMMMM.  Of what I could remember, I got a cold beef tongue and tripe appetizer that was surprisingly tasty.  My friend has had it at some other szechuan restaurants and said they made it really well.  We also got a spicy fish and vegetable dish (there are two on the menu, but I don't know which one she got...she knew the difference based on the chinese names).  Also really good! Spicy after a few bites, but worth the burn.  The second time we got one of the big hot pots with fish and veggies and maybe other meats?  It was really big and enough to feed our group of 5.  It was also quite spicy and had this weird pepper that made your tongue tingle.  Good for groups.  We also tried the ma-po tofu which was tasty, pretty standard.  Overall, good spicy Chinese food! Make sure you order the right things, or else it might just seem kinda meh to you.  And yes, it's a Chinese restaurant so the service and cleanliness may be a bit questionable...but it's kind of what you get at most good Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Food is incredible! Best Chinese I've ever had! Atmosphere is chaotic and service wasn't great, but it was a busy Saturday night. It definitely made for an interesting experience. Yelp rates the noise level as \"average\", but it was LOUD. Being a busy Saturday night in a small, crowded restaurant, I suppose it goes with the territory. We tried many different menu items and were all happy with our selections.  I always say that I would prefer to go to a restaurant with exceptional service and good food than one with poor service and exceptional food; Szechuan Gourmet is an exception to this rule. The atmosphere and service somehow added to the experience of dining on the best Chinese food of my life.  Strongly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Oh baby! That was one amazing meal. I ordered the spicy wonton and mopo tofu and it hit all the right spots. Szechuan food is known for spice level and that can be intimidating to the layman, but the spice in these dishes was extremely flavorful and added versus subtracted from its deliciousness. Although the mopo tofu has small bits of pork in it, it isn't the meat that makes the dish. Surprising to my carnivore senses, the texture of the tofu and the tasty chili sauce it is seeped in are the true stars of the show.   Also, not being a connoisseur of szechuan food, I was skeptical as to whether it would just be a normal general tso's chicken type of meal. Szechuan Gourmet is not that - I may not know exactly what authentic szechuan is, but this stuff tasted great!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my co worker and at first she didn't want too go based on an earlier bad experience. After seeing many positive reviews we went. I drank water she ordered Diet Coke and the look of shock on her face when handed a can and straw was priceless. She just went \"wow ok...\"  The food for me was great. The veg egg rolls were great. My ma po tofu was delicious could have used more rice tho. She had a poorly mixed Lo mein that she was disappointed with. 2 bad ones in a row made her not wanna return. The waitress was aloof but the waiters were friendly. No one said a thing as we walked past 4 employees too leave. Poor manners."}
{"text":"This is our family favourite. The moo shu pork with pancakes is delicious. The crispy ginger beef is a little spicy but excellent. Can't really complain about any dish here. The restaurant gets pretty busy but if you call in for delivery they make pretty good time."}
{"text":"I've heard of this restaurant from my Chinese friends but have never set foot in it because of its reputation of uber spicy dishes. Fear thee not, my fellow foodies who can't take any level of spicy-ness! I'm writing this review just for you.  My dining partners today can not eat spicy food. Luckily the menu graphically indicates 3 levels of spiciness on all the dishes. There were still quite a lot of choices for you non-spicy eaters.   I usually don't write review on my first try of the place, unless I'm with someone who has the authority to comment on the authenticity. Today I was with my mom, whose family was from northern China. They regularly make dumplings, buns, noodles, scallion pancakes at home. Hence my mom is firstly picky about Chinese food in general, and secondly particularly picky about any food made from dough. When I took her to Indian restaurants she'd comment on the naan too.  We ordered:  - wontons in clear broth - steamed dumplings  Mom approved both. She said the dough must've been made fresh in house. The fillings were solid, if anything perhaps lacks vegetable.   It's hard to get her approval on dumplings. She did not approve the dumplings at Hunan Solon because the dough was too \"powdery\".   - woodear and silk melon: the flavor profile is bright and light, not your usual Szechuan flavor. It's good to know that a heavy flavor restaurant can do light flavor dishes well.   - fried tofu in brown sauce: mom said the quality of the tofu is good. I like this dish.  - country style lamb: it was not what we expected. We thought it was going to be dry, but it came with gravy and lots of onions. It's not bad though.  Overall all five dishes we ordered today had mom's approval. She thought this restaurant hasn't Americanized it's favors yet. I hope it continues this way.  Here we are, I realize we were not the typical customers; came to Szechuan but requested everything to be non spicy, greasy, salty. This is a place I will go back and try some level 1 spicy dishes next time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Cleveland, hands down! There is no better place for spicy, authentic Chinese food, and they even have karaoke here! Szechuan Gourmet is located next to Tink Holl market, and although it doesn't look very fancy it makes up in that department with their delicious food. On top of that, they are open fairly late, so you can sing and eat til' your heart's content.   My favorite dishes: spicy bean noodle, sauteed loofah with mushroom, lotus root with peanuts, dan dan mien (noodles with minced pork soy bean paste), fish filet with veggies and hot peppers, and the salt and pepper crispy prawns. I've also had the ma-po tofu, dried pot- intestines, dried pot- lamb, braised eggplant, and giant grilled prawns on skewers (this is not on the menu, it's a special request item).   All the food here is pretty delicious. Although I've been here many times, I'm still trying out new dishes! It's a great place for groups as well, and if you spend enough they allow you to use the KTV room for free! The place is usually busy, so you can tell the food must be good!"}
{"text":"Take a cuisine known it's in own culture as being one of the best and sprinkle its delectable goodness all over Cleveland and what do you get? Szechuan Gourmet! You should be adventurous and good spirited to dine here. Here's why, you want good authentic food? Ask for the fish to be served whole. I mean the entire fish on your plate. Here's why, one of the key to good Sichuan food is freshness. Whole fish is much fresher. The other keys to Sichuan cuisine are bold use of garlic and chili peppers. So here is where the good spirited part comes in handy. Eat this meal the Chinese way. The rice you're served is your main dish. You flavor your rice with dishes you've ordered bite size at a time. It's how it's meant to be savored. They presented me with two menus when I arrive. The only thing I ordered off the menu was the appetizer. Everything else, I asked about their specialities. Their recommendation was based on the protein choice I made (fish and lamb). We also asked for a recommendation for a vegi dish. Their garlic stir-fried snow pea tips is by far the best I've had around town. It's a spicy kind of place but they'll accommodate. So don't shy away from this gem in our little Chinatown."}
{"text":"These are the dishes we've tried crispy beef- TO DIE FOR - on the sweet side so balance it with something spicy on the side- A MUST TRY chicken pakora - spicy and mild- BOTH great! so great, white meat veggie noodles- delicous!! fried rice- awesome general tso chicken - okay  chilli chicken - its chicken pakora with sauce, its great.  this place is a must try - you won't be dissapointed, wish i had pictures to share."}
{"text":"Try the pork with garlic sauce.  Great food and great service!  Perfect size restaurant, my favorite place for Chinese in town hands down"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best asian food in Cleveland! Super authentic. We order take out there once a week. One of our first times ordering, we asked the woman to give us one of their most authentic dishes, and she recommended the White fish with vegetables in hot pepper, and it was beyond amazing and now a part of our regular order everytime we order from there!  Also great is their general taos chicken and spicy green beans... but cant go wrong with anything you get!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, been here 10s of times.  Will be back.  Its authentic Chinese food that packs a little extra punch. Their spicy lamb dish is awesome, and I am a big fan of one their Lotus root dishes as well. Get something green and garlicy to combat some of the spice and you'll be good to go.    They also have a larger room in the back if you want to host a party with some limited and mostly Chinese karaoke in the back, but you better bring a lot of hungry people as there is a minumum spent charge.    I still can't decide if I like this place or Wonton Gourmet around the corner more, so I just go to both once a month."}
{"text":"Very tasty Chinese cuisine is to be had here! My bf had the Szechuan Chicken with Peanuts and I had the Smoky Pork fried rice. His dish was super spicy just how he likes it and so delicious! My fried rice was perfect!   This is a very authentic hidden spot in Cleveland's Asia Town. The service was very good and the place has a really good overall feel.  We plan to return the next time we have a desire for some Chinese food."}
{"text":"Man, this place is good.  Went here with 3 others for dinner and everything was fantastic!  The food is authentic and tasty.  The service is very good and quick as well."}
{"text":"I give it five starts not because Szechuan Gourmet is perfect but that it is the best Chinese food I can find in Cleveland. As a Chinese living in a mid-size city in the US, I am constantly frustrated by the fact that most \"Chinese food\" here is really just low quality and bland Cantonese or Fujianese food. Don't get me wrong, good Cantonese and Fujianese food can be extremely flavorful but that's not what you commonly find in the US.  Suchuanese food's popularity has taken all over China and I'm an addict to its spiciness and flavorfulness. From what I've heard, although the owners of Szechuan Gourmet are not from Sichuan, the chefs are, and their food definitely tastes like so. I used to go to Wonton Gourmet to crush my cravings for good Chinese food but since Sichuan Gourmet's opening, this is the only place I go to now (sorry Wonton Gourmet, good times though).  I'm absolutely in love with the \"water-boiled\" (very spicy) fish and beef (Shui Zhu Yu & Zhu Shui Niu). My husband orders the dan dan noodles (Dan Dan Mian) strings beans with minced pork ()every time. Their \"husband-wife lung slices\" (Fu Qi Fei Pian) made with husband-wife lung slices (I mean thinly sliced beef and beef offal in spicy oil), a signature cold dish of Sichuan, is also excellent. If you want mild spiciness, try fish-flavored pork slices (Yu Xiang Rou Si). Anyway, I am really happy that Cleveland has Szechuan Gourmet!"}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food in Cleveland! This place is absolutely excellent. We found it one night while in the area and just looking for somewhere to eat, and we really lucked out and have been back multiple times since. My experience is that around 3 dishes seems about right for 2 hungry people, and it's easy to have your meals family-style.  The three-pepper chicken is spicy, but very good if you can handle that. The salt-and-pepper squid is much more tame in terms of how intense the flavor is. I'm not as fond of the lotus with peanut, but if you're looking for vegetarian options, I'd certainly recommend the eggplant in black bean sauce, especially alongside one of the spicier dishes to balance it out. Really, though, there's very little I haven't enjoyed here as of yet (although if you go to this place and order something like General Tso's, I will silently judge you from behind my computer screen)."}
{"text":"My mother can't handle Sichuan spice very well, so we got all non spicy dishes. We had the three cups chicken (???), eggplant, and sweet and sour pork chops. I really liked how sweet the three cups chicken was - I felt it was too salty at a lot of other places, but the three cups chicken at Szechuan Gourmet is very sweet and flavorful. The eggplant was really good too. I felt the texture of the pork was a bit too chewy though. Solid place to order Sichuan food in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great food. Crispy ginger chicken and spicy peanut chicken are favorite. Fast and friendly service every time we've been."}
{"text":"Okay, so I can't handle spicy food.  I didn't come here for the longest time because of the Szechuan and the hot peppers in their name.  Then came the amazing reviews on yelp and the personal recommendations from all of my Asian friends.  And I still didn't dare.   Then, on the evening of July 4th, pre-fireworks, I was half full of barbeque but my parents had just driven into town and were hungry.  What to do, what to do.  Of course, Chinese restaurants are open on July 4th.   So we came here at around 8 pm on July 4th, and the entire place was packed with what seemed like every Chinese person in town.  I shied completely away from spice and ordered hong shao tofu (red braised tofu), lobster with ginger+scallion, and a pork strip dish.  Came back two weeks later with friends and had the cong you bing (scallion pancakes), san bei ji (3 cups chicken), xiang gan rou si (stir-fried pork + tofu), and ba zhen dou fu (8 treasure tofu - a mix of tofu and a bunch of seafood, veggies, mushrooms, etc).   Of all things I've tried ,the pork strip dish I had with my parents was only thing that wasn't up to par (parents thought it was too sweet).  Everything else was great.  This is probably the only place in Cleveland that has gotten xiang gan rou si correct.  And the chicken was a bit spicy but it still tasted good!  We'll definitely be back here to try the karaoke."}
{"text":"Ok, I only tried 2 dishes here: the supposedly \"dry sauteed\" Szechuan beef (it was fried below at least 1 foot of oil) and the special prawns (smothered in a sweet and sour suace).  Both were very tasty, but man the food is here is just so greasy and unhealthy, I don't think I will go back often. Its in that \"once a year\" category for me. pure gluttony.  spicy-lovers note: medium isn't spicy at all. Don't shy away from ordering the dishes \"hot\"."}
{"text":"Very very good authentic Chinese food. One of my favorites now in the Cleveland area. I had the dry pot which was fantastic, very satisfied."}
{"text":"I wanted some Asian food during my last night in Cleveland, so decided to visit this restaurant after scouting the area out (with Yelp, of course). It's tucked away in a little plaza along with a marketplace, but not too hard to find.  I came in for a rather early dinner so the place was pretty empty when I walked in, but the interior is clean and decently spacious. The host was really nice and promptly got me seated. I ordered the Shui Zhu Yu (Szechuan style boiled fish) for ~$15, which is a dish I fell in love with when I visited China a few years ago. The food came out really quickly.  Compared to what I had in China and a couple other places, the dish itself was not as good. It lacked the strong flavors and the distinctive spiciness of the mala peppers that I really look for (makes your mouth go numb!). However, I really appreciated that the food wasn't too salty (which in my opinion is a big problem in a lot of Asian restaurants), and the portion was pretty generous.   What really made this place stand out was the hospitality and the service. I feel like Asian restaurants often have a bad reputation for aloof and bad service, but this place definitely broke that stereotype. The servers were friendly and checked in multiple times to make sure I was doing okay. They offered to pack my food to-go when they noticed that I had stopped eating. The owner even stopped by to see how I was doing! The real highlight, however, was when I was waiting outside for my uber (it was raining), and the owner himself stepped outside with an umbrella to see if he could walk me to my destination. I think that's really going above and beyond for your customers.   If I lived in the area, I'd definitely go back for my Asian food fix. Looks like they have a big (but not overwhelming) selection of authentic dishes, and it's probably the best you'll get in the area!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmm. So yummy. Friendly staff. Prompt service. This is one of those perfect \"random\" little restaurants that I love to go to. Some of the dishes really do remind me of food I ate in Asia. I appreciate them sticking as close to authenticity as possible considering they aren't in Asia!   Dishes I would eat over and over again*: Mapo Tofu, Shui Zhu Yu (Water Boiled Fish), Ma La Niu Jin (Beef Tendon), Gan Ban Si Ji Tou (Spicy Green Beans).   *Please excuse my spellings/rough translations!"}
{"text":"I don't pretend to be an expert on the authenticity of Chinese restaurants, but I do tend to prefer places like Szechuan Gourmet, where, in true \"Stuff White People Like\" style, I'm in the minority as a patron and neighboring tables are sampling mysterious delights. I like trashy American takeout Chinese, but I realize it's not great food. Szechuan Gourmet, however, is making great food. My heat-seeking husband got a flaming cauldron of a hotpot, jammed with a pile of flounder filets, bean sprouts, enoki mushrooms, and enough peppers to light up Asiatown. The hairlike mushrooms were similar to noodles, and the fish was cooked perfectly and super fresh. I got a delicate tofu soup and scallion pancakes, and we split an order of pungent and spicy shredded vegetables. As much as we enjoyed our meal, we envied a lot of the tables around us, which were enjoying a steady stream of treats from the giant menu. The restaurant had a huge and attentive staff when we were there, and we got our food quickly. I'll be back to try a lot more."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.... but really greasy.  I've come to this restaurant quite a few times with different friends.  Some of my friends are actually from the Sichuan province, so that tells me that (1) the food is at least to native standards and (2) when they order, I am most likely getting common dishes that would be either cooked or ordered at home.  The tripe appetizer seems to be a common order among all of my groups of friends.  Served cold, it tastes really good.  Forget what part of the animal it comes from and you'll love this dish.  The spicy fish is also a popular dish here, ordered almost every time I go to the restaurant.  I like the spicy fish here the best out of all of the spicy fish dishes in Cleveland.  The fish tastes good and there is a decent amount of spice and flavor.  Some restaurants overdo the spice so it is too hot to eat, and other restaurants do not make the broth very well - but here, both the spice and the broth are done well.  There are also large \"pots\" which serve an assortment of stir fried vegetables and various meats and of course, lots of chili peppers.  These are best shared - way too big for one person.  I recently tried the chicken with mushroom dish, which was also really good.   A sweet dish, not very spicy.  The only reason that I don't come here very often is that the food is very greasy.  Even the vegetables seem more greasy than in other Asian restaurants.  I'm not sure if this is how the food is supposed to be prepared, so I'm not complaining.    But in small or medium portions, the food is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Ok Devan, I couldnt wait until the unofficial Yelp event at the restaurant, I had to go and try this place and it was really really good. Finally a restaurant in my neck of the woods!   The food was really yummy and made spicy for us just the way we like it. I arrived around 7:15 to place an order and it was ready in 15 minutes. The crispy ginger beef is so so good (oily but dont hate), as is the hot and sour soup! When asking for some recommendations from the staff on what noodles to get the answer was \"everything is good, depends what you like\" (typical!) so I picked the house special  and they totally went well with the szechuan chicken we got. (I fought my urge to get the crispy noodles because not many people makes those, but they are usually much better for an eat in dinner, next time, next time)  All in all a great experience, probably better if we shared this meal with more than 3 people because we have enough to serve another 3 in the fridge,  all under 42$ !   Thanks Devan!   P.S. There is a 10% discount for pick up orders."}
{"text":"Typical greasy neighbourhood Canadian Chinese, but a little spicier. I usually get the spicy peanut chicken and have been known to sit at a table where everyone orders it. I don't know why I keep ordering it, some of the pieces in it usually taste more than a little off and it's not something I've ever seen on a proper Chinese restaurant's menu. It's clear that this is a place that caters more to the Western consumer- plates and forks adorn the tables. Generally exceedingly busy during the evenings, I've found I've tried to get a take out from this place one too many times during the week to find it closed."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland visiting some friends and decided to give this place a shot. We came for an early dinner and the place is really nice and quiet with soft music in the background.  I have a huge love of spicy food - this place hits the spot! The dishes were flavorful and had a nice kick. Nothing was overpowering or overbearingly spicy so of you want it hotter, might be good to ask for extra spicy. The pea sprouts here are cooked well, they have great texture.  The mapo tofu was soft and silky. Fish was also tender. Everything was done very well.  Parking is in the back. It's a little small so you might want to come early or late just to find ample parking."}
{"text":"This is truly a hidden gem and some of the best Asian food I've had in Cleveland. The three spiced chicken was delicious along with the real white meat General tso. Will definitely be back for the lo mein."}
{"text":"This place can be really hit or miss depending on how busy they are.  Some times the fried rice is great and sometimes just mush.  The order choices are different depending on who you speak too.  Sometimes they want a tip on takeout depending on who cashes you out, overall just OK"}
{"text":"Undoubtedly the best Chinese restaurant in Cleveland. The food is always spectacular, and portion sizes are great.  The Hot and Sour Soup is super-spicy... love it!"}
{"text":"My first experience with Hakka food was well worth the trek out to the boonies. Devan R made the dish picks for our UYE group and didn't let us down.  We started with two soups: hot and sour and chicken and corn. Both are Chinese restaurant standards but were perfectly executed at Szechuan Gourmet. The corn, with soy sauce and red chili as per Devan's suggestion, was one of the highlights of the meal for me. It's wonderfully creamy and flavourful.  After the soup about 8 different mains quickly arrived at our table. Highlights for me were the crispy chicken, crispy beef, chili chicken, and sizzling shrimp with scallions and ginger. The crispy dishes have an awesome combination of textures and flavours.  Although I don't know much about Hakka food I expected it to be super hot and was surprised that this wasn't the case at all. I think the food could have done with some more heat in fact. But, they may have been toning things down since there were a bunch of whiteys at the table.  Also, I'd order a vegetable dish or two next time. After eating about a pound and a half of meat I felt like I was going to enter a meat induced coma.  Pro Tip: Convince Devan R to come with you and order for the table."}
{"text":"Literally everything is amazing. Portion size is great for the price. There is such a variety of flavors, which I wasn't expecting between dishes this spicy."}
{"text":"If you are looking for American Chinese food, please don't step in this restaurant. It is not like those Chinese takeout places. If you are really looking for the Szechuan style food, hot, spicy, heavily seasoned dish and even KTV ( Karaoke in a private room)come here, it will not disappoint you.   Best Szechuan food in Cleveland. Food is pretty authentic and service is tentative. They recently extended their service hour until 1am. That makes me super excited. I usually come with friends who can tolerate super spicy food with family style to share and taste different dishes.  Don't forget to order \"qing-dao\" beer. It goes so well with those spicy food......   My recommendation will be beef tripe & tongue in hot pepper sauce, Szechuan fired chicken,  dried pot series, pork belly cold appetizer, and my favorite non-spicy veggie dish is loofah w. Fungus and mushroom  Yum.... I am hungry again."}
{"text":"The best, real, Szechuan food in the greater Cleveland area. My wife (who is Chinese) loves it as have the numerous friends from Szechuan that we have brought here.   If you are looking for dishes that are as close to what you might find in some city in Szechuan province as you can get then you won't find anything better in the Cleveland area. If you are looking for General Tso's Chicken, fried rice or some other generic, mediocre, buffet specialty you will be disappointed as this place only serves good food."}
{"text":"This is probably the first true authentic Szechuan cuisine I tasted. I had a pretty good service from my server. She was very suggestive on menu choices.  We ordered a bunch of dishes and enjoy everyone of it. It look wickedly spicy but it's not. The szechuan peppers gives you that nice flavor spicy sensation that goes away after the meal. The flavor is really good. We ordered the diced rabbit and peanuts. The flavor is great but I don't care too much about being so bony. The beef tripe and tongue in hot pepper is really delicious. The tongue taste like beef pot roast. Everything sliced paper thin. The \"Dried Pot\" has different meat choices and we picked beef. Delicious cooked with bean sauce, szechuan peppers, lotus roots, big bean sprouts, seaweed, dried tofu. As long as I don't eat the big red chili pepper, the dish is fairly good.   I will definitely go back and try some more different dishes."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the worst Asian restaurant experience in my memory, not to mention a health and sanitation nightmare. I have a stomach of steel, and it took two days to recover from whatever nightmarish concoction of grease, spices, and bacteria I was served two nights ago.  I ordered something the non-English-speaking waiter had to go get a broken English speaking waiter to explain to me, some kind of a dry pepper chicken dish. It was nothing but a combination of greasy chicken, dried peppers, and peanuts. It was served in a plastic basket lined with tinfoil, I mean come on how cheap do you have to be that you won't even put food into a dish that will be washed?  The hot and sour soup wasn't even remotely pleasant, and a trip to the bathroom made you wonder how patrons ever leave here without a variety of intestinal diseases. The hallway leading to the restroom had the kind of smell you'd expect from the back rooms of a fishmarket on the banks of the Yangtze River, with lighting reminiscent of the scene from blade runner where the replicants confront the man who makes eyes.  There are so many other great Asian places in Cleveland, I cannot understand how this place stays in business."}
{"text":"Great place for flavorful spicy chinese food. The menu is extensive but not overwhelming.  Spicy, pork , fish, chicken and beef dishes. My favorite is boiled fish. It's spicy and flavorful just how I like it. The manager told us he can also make it sweet and spicy. That really impressed me, a manager that cares about his customers experience.    It's a small restaurant with a choice of comfortable booths or dining tables. The lighting is a little on the dark side which made for an intimate atmosphere.  They have private banquet /karaoke rooms and they serve Chinese  beer :-) . All in all this is a great place for a group of friends or lovers to meet."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Loved every item we ordered.  I read a lot about the ginger chicken but was iffy about the ginger.  INCREDIBLE dish!   Crispy Beef is pretty delicious as well.  Spring rolls were crispy and full of goodness. Big portions Great tasting food Their beef dishes melt in your mouth too! Fast service and friendly"}
{"text":"Stopped in for take out. Ordered the House fried rice with beef and broccoli.  The sliced beef with broccoli was delicious. The beef was tender and the broccoli was also soft (which was weired texture wise but was ok by me.). House fried rice was also delicious and had flavor in it.  Mind you there was a 6 hour gap between from when i ordered the food and ate it. So after 6 hours from the fridge it tasted good is a score in my book. Iv had chinese food that was bland right out of the kitchen so I was pleased with this place  The place is spacious and clean. Good venue for a sit down dinner."}
{"text":"So, I'm a Szechuan Gourmet convert.  The first time I went there with my husband, I had an eggroll and sesame chicken, because I was afraid of the hot, spicy Szechuan cuisine.    It's scary... everything is covered in dried red peppers and red chili oil.  Red = Hot in my book.  Not so if you are talking about Szechuan peppercorns.  They are suprisingly not hot in the traditional sense.   The Szechuan peppercorn is spicy, but in a limited fashion.  It might feel hot on your tongue briefly when you eat them, but the heat fades quickly and does not build as it does with traditional peppers.  They have a floral scent that is noticably different than usual peppercorns and leave your mouth feeling cool like menthol.  I have grown to love this cuisine quickly and find myself eating food I never thought possible.   They have more Americanized dishes on the menu, but I would avoid them as they are not very good.  I love the ma poh tofu, dry string beans, lotus root with peanuts, eggplant with garlic sauce.  The portions are large and I recommend sharing so you can try different dishes.  Everything is delicious and covered in the Szechuan peppers.  I really think this restaurant is a needed addition to the variety in the downtown Cleveland Chinatown area.  Give it a try, even if you can't usually take the heat, like me!"}
{"text":"Great bang for your buck. The more friends you bring, the better the outcome.  As was mentioned by everyone and their mothers, the Ginger Chicken, Sizzing Shrimp, and Sauted Shredded Beef along with some orders of rice... That'll get you through anything. But bring more friends and try a few new dishes. Live and learn."}
{"text":"I went here hoping to get some of the dishes I miss so much since Yen Ching in Bayview Village closed down, so this review might not be unbiased...   Based on a lot of reviews here we tried the Crispy Beef and Crispy Chicken and were entirely disappointed.  Really oily, and chewy, not tender and the sauce was salty, dark and strong.    Chili chicken... I think everyone has their favourite place.  Ours is Yueh Tung, downtown, so the version here just seemed, again, oily and not that tasty.  Shredded pork in garlic sauce had a spice that I couldn't place but didn't like... a lot of dishes seemed to have traces of this spice and it made all the food taste the same.  Singapore noodles were bland and tasteless.  It was a Sunday night and the place was packed, but I couldn't help but notice it was packed with non-Chinese/Gwai-lo... so if you like Chinese food that appeals to non-Chinese then this the place for you.    If you tend to like places that are filled with Chinese diners who know what's good, you will be greatly disappointed.  I'm not Chinese, but I prefer authentic stuff."}
{"text":"Discrimination at it's finest. Come to this restaurant if you are a minority and look yound. See how they treat you. Here's the story- I entered the restaurant and the lady was talking to customers and never acknowledged me, so I sat down at one of the chairs in the front. The men finally stopped talking and left the restaurant. She still did not acknowledge me until I stood up and asked her if i could have the menu for delivery. She points to her left, amd i took the takeout menu. After deciding what to order, I stand up and tell her politely that i am ready and she is on her computer, STILL no acknowledgement or reaction. So i wait... 2 minutes later she says what would i like to order. Are you serious? This is how you handle service? Either way it was the closest to my building so gave the order and took the food. Tastes like generic chinese msg loaded take out.  Extremely bias on the rating because of horrendous service and lack of respect."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic service and, more importantly,  delicious food. If you're looking for takeout in boxes, then go to panda express. This place has authentic food that rivals most chinese restraunts I've been to in China. Their chef is from the Szichuan province and makes food that I crave everyday. This fuckboi jeff b down below obviously does not understand quality."}
{"text":"Cleveland what is wrong with you?!  This place should be packed to the hilt!  This is an updated review I placed in March.  My wife and I have returned to Cleveland and have eaten here twice this week.  It is an authentic Szechuan restaurant attached to an import business and Chinese grocery store in a large industrial building.  Killer real Chinese food.  We had shrimps every which way...fried and salted, another dish with walnuts.  Every version was fantastic.  We had fried lotus root which was good."}
{"text":"Came with a big group - 14 people - and ordered family style. They handled our group efficiently. We had two people order for everyone, so that might have helped things. Staff was attentive and the food came out lightning fast, so big pluses for those two things. The food is delicious. Everything is full of flavor, amazing, mouth watering tastes.  Would definitely recommend if you're looking for Chinese. The best I've had in Cleveland so far!"}
{"text":"A friend invited us there. Such a pleasantly surprisingly place to dine in! Tried their duck, fish, twice cooked pork, and green onion pancake, which were all very tasty. Will definitely go there again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome,  we a re vegetarian and they have reasonable selection of items, the bean curd was great. We asked for schezuan and spicy and it was really really hot and I can eat hot. Next time I would order one plate that is not so spicy, and one that is so you can balance it. The curry veg spring rolls were really good too. Service was great very attentive staff.  Only reason they don't get 5 stars is cause I wish they told us how hot the spicy is. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Chinese food, pretty spacious, good for groups. I've tried a good number of dishes here and enjoyed them all."}
{"text":"Great Szechuan food in Cleveland. Definitely not the best I've had, but acceptable for this city. I've been here multiple times. It's conveniently located on my way home from work, so take out is a regular occurrence for me. My go-to's are three pepper chicken and/or sesame chicken with string beans on the side. I've tried various other chicken and beef meat dishes, but always come back to those two. Most recently, I went on Christmas Day and it was packed! So call ahead if you're participating in the movies and Chinese food on Christmas Day tradition :)"}
{"text":"Gave it a third chance. Definitely better this time. I think you definitely need to choose the right dishes.   5 stars for their Yu Shian Rou Si (shredded pork with garlic sauce). It was a perfect combination of savory, sweet and spicy. Loved the texture of the veggies in there; although still not quite sure what the main veggie in it was (maybe radish? or some other root veggie). They also might have had some fungus in it. Either way, loved this dish. Would definitely get it again. Only $8.95 too!  3.5 stars for the dry pot. We got the option to pick 5 veggies and 5 meats; $19.95 for a small dry pot. It was pretty spicy, pretty numbing. Bf thought it was too one dimensional. Did not think the tastiness was worth $20 though.   3.5 stars for gan ban si ji tou (green beans). There was no meat in this dish! Thought it would be like the one they have at Wonton Gourmet (green beans + garlic + shredded pork). Tasty, but the 1st dish stole my attention.  1.5 stars for the kung pao ji ding. We have gotten this everytime we have gone to this place. It is an inconsistent dish. This time, it was salty, but would be tastier with more vinegar and sugar.   Price: for 4 people + 2 beers, $61 pre-tip post-tax.   Bottom line, would come here again for the Yu Shian Rou Si.   Tip: if you pay in cash, you don't have to pay tax."}
{"text":"They use msg. I called and asked after I ate their because of a chemical aftertaste and they confirmed it. So all the rave reviews need to come with a Surgeon General's warning."}
{"text":"I must add to the last review that there is a hidden dish that I did not try until last time I visited there - the szechuan style fried chicken. It was SO flavorful that all of my friends, asian or not, just kept eating it! I am known as a huge fan of fried chicken and this asian style fried chicken is definitely a must try and you will NOT get disappointed! You can also request to have bones removed, so it's just like tiny chicken nuggets that you can pop multiple in your mouth!  Another dish that we tried was dried pot rabbit! Yes RABBIT! I personally think they could have done a better job making it more dry and more fried but it tasted pretty ok.  One last dish that I MUST recommend is the water boiled fish or fish in szechuan sauce or whatever it's called. you must try it! The fish was not overcooked or undercooked and the spicy level was just about right. Although the dish may look very intimidating and seemed like there was a bunch of oil floating there, it was not oily at all!"}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese spicy food. Recommend their tiger peppers and sautéed pig kidney(if u dare to try)"}
{"text":"I had a hard time deciding what to order, and the photos on Yelp for Szechuan Gourmet came in really handy when trying to choose an entrée. I settled on the sliced beef in hot pepper sauce. I loved (LOVED!) the spiciness of the dish, but not the greasiness...  The service was great, and the prices are outstanding, considering all the portions are large enough for 2-4 people...although, who are they kidding with the tiny portion of rice?"}
{"text":"Most authentic and best quality Chinese food in Cleveland!!!! The restaurant I most look forward to the most when I come back from college. Highly highly recommend shui Zhu yu and hui Guo rou"}
{"text":"Everyone on Yelp raves about it and it is rumored to be spicy. I love the little Szechuan peppercorn berries and dried chili peppers in the food. The little berries particularly add a nice little kick to the food. We tried a bunch of different entrees here and enjoyed them all. The fish pot was probably my favorite. The spicy lamb was terrific as well. The lamb meat was nice and lean while being very tender. I also highly recommend the snow pea leaves sauteed in garlic. They were delicious! Asian veggies just seem so much more interesting than the veggies that I usually cook. Except for asparagus which takes on a second life after you eat it and haunts you for sometimes over a day."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Chinese spot in Cleveland with Siam Cafe coming in a close second. If you like spicy (Sichuan style) Chinese food it is a must eat. Spicy fish stew. dry pot (choose your own ingredients, ham and beef are both recommended) stir fried string beans, mapo tofu are all favorites. This place is certified good by Beijingese family of ours. Eat here!"}
{"text":"This isn't the cheapest Chinese food, but the value is good. The portions are large and the quality is good. Even on a holiday (NY's Day) the food quality was consistent.   A large serving of rice was provided with the two entrees I got to go. The entrees were large portions and provided enough for a second lunch.   One nice thing about take out is you can dish the food onto another plate and not eat all of the sauce.   I recommend the Chicken & Mixed Veg.   Also order via Skip the Dishes"}
{"text":"The pepper steak was one of the best I've had in a long time.  I asked for some extra heat and I got it.  They don't skimp on the beef either.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Eggplant casserole is yummy.  The pepper chicken dish is sooooooo gooooooood. And their fried rice is awesome. Love this place for good, consistent Schezuan food that is spicy and tasty."}
{"text":"My first time here, everyone is very friendly, I went with the Ma Po Tofu w/ Chili Minced Pork, based on the the recommendation of Doug Trattner from his Scene Magazine article.  I don't usually eat tofu, but this was very savory, spicy, and I ate the whole thing.  I bit oily, but I got past that because it was different then anything I have ever eaten before.  Their menu is large, so there are plenty of options, will probably go with one of the dry pots next time, looked like everyone else was eating that, so it must be great."}
{"text":"I would definitely go as far as to say this is my favorite Chinese food in Cleveland. Every time I go I tend to order the same thing, but it's because it is so good! The appetizers there are to die for and my favorite entree is definitely the lamb with cumin. I always make sure to bring anyone new to Cleveland to Szechuan and will continue to! The area is definitely pretty cool and is worth checking out for anyone who is not familiar with it."}
{"text":"Best Hakkah food and they deliver so fast!! Order spicy chilli beef!"}
{"text":"Very white-washed. The food was very simple - very oily too. On the plus side, the dishes were very warm and the portions were huge. I have to give it a low rating because I tend to enjoy more authentic cuisine."}
{"text":"This is the upper echelon of Asian cuisine, its the bees knees people. I had the Chicken corn soup, it was sweet, but not too sweet, just right. For my meal I ordered the Mongolian Beef Three, it was beef, chicken and shrimp mixed with mushrooms and onions. It was very flavorful. The rice is perfect too, many places rice is super sticky, not a fan. This was perfect.   If the rest of their menu is presented as well and packs the flavor of my Mongolian Beef Three, I will be a regular here.   The interior is plain jane-ish, nothing special,  the folks here dont need a fancy ambiance. They just slap a plate if deliciousness in front of you and nothing else matters from then on, you're in a happy place. A belly pleasing tranquil place."}
{"text":"The food here is very good.  Attached to an Asian supermarket and warehouse.  I have eaten here several times as I really do enjoy the food.    Last week a few us went before the dinner rush and we were the only ones in the place.  This past week I ordered a pork spring roll.  It came out and looked more like an egg roll.  A crispy and hot exterior led to a tender and perfectly seasoned filling.  The dipping sauce served with it was a nice compliment.    For dinner I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken.  The chicken was tender and cooked perfectly.  The seasonings were well done and is probably one of the best versions of this dish I've had.  I ate bites of chicken and bell pepper.  Chicken and hot pepper.  Peanuts, garlic, ginger.  It's all in there and was delicious.  I am going to include a picture of the dish along with the chicken and broccoli my mom got for dinner.  She raved about it.  Biggest issue at the restaurant is communication.  Everyone working here must have lived in China last week.  I don't think anyone can speak more than 1 or 2 words of English.  That makes it especially difficult to order something off the menu when you don't know what it is.  They have a very vast menu.  They give you a picture menu with the regular menu to make up for it.  But it doesn't have the whole menu there in pictures.  Nevertheless, the food is very good and I'll still stop here for a bite to eat when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent.  We thought this was just going to be another ho-hum Chinese restaurant.  Were we surprised!  Excellent - great food, great service.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"A little pricey but great food. Szechuan dry chicken is amazing. Worth the additional money if you want authentic Szechuan."}
{"text":"I would give a zero if they had such a rating here.  Without a doubt the rudest, most unfriendly service I have ever experienced!  If you want your day ruined, then this is the restaurant to do it for you."}
{"text":"Have to thank all the great reviewers for this recommended gem. Exactly what they said...best Chinese in Cleveland! The menu is vast but they have a handy picture book menu to help you envision the deliciousness and make your mouth water at the same time. We went simple, with spicy garlic shrimp and beef Ho Fun. Good level of spice but will be venturing spicier next time. I rest my tastebuds in their hands."}
{"text":"I am neither chinese nor do I know anything about the food or this place. It's kinda weird to find all hidden away on the side street. My teenage brother got the chicken with three cups sauce. I got the dan dan noodles which was more of a side dish. The servers were so friendly! And we loved the food."}
{"text":"You need to go.   My first trip to Szechuan Gourmet was a complete accident. I was in Independence on a date and I asked Google to find me chinese for there and it did. Except the place it took me to was out of business. So I took the next reasonable step and asked Google what the best chinese food in Cleveland was. It led me here. When I fish pulled into the parking lot my immediate reaction was, that's a good sign: it shares a building with an Asian market. Walking in inspired a similar reaction. It was 7 PM on a Tuesday and it was full. I miss frequent the place. I live in Akron and I have, on multiple occasions driven to Cleveland for no reason but to go to Szechuan Gourmet.   I have to good point had: Kung Po Chicken, Dry pepper chicken with peanut, the style pepper chicken, three cups chicken, sesame chicken, fried tofu with chili and peanut, braised tofu in brown sauce, salt and pepper tofu, tofu in sweet sauce, and Singapore style noodles. I have not been disappointed yet.   Whether you're looking for a place to try new dishes, or a ho to chinese joint, treat yourself and make it here."}
{"text":"Great little place tucked in the corner next to Tink Holl grocery store. I'm not sure why I've never stopped in here, but I'm glad I did.   I'll start off by saying that I feel the service here on my first visit was excellent. They had at least 3 or 4 servers circling the dining room checking on people, so at no point did you feel like you would have to wait for a server to come back out of the kitchen in order to ask for something.   They have a typical Chinese lunch special menu (no pictures) and then a more traditional picture menu with Szechuan dishes. this made it easy to choose if you wanted to try something new, but aren't familiar with the names of the dishes.   I ended up choosing a medley of options because I couldn't choose just one. I ordered the dumplings with spicy sauce (appetizer) as well as the spicy garlic eggplant and tendon and tripe dish. My least favorite was the tendon and tripe dish, it tasted fine but it was served cold which just isn't a preference of mine. The dish also didn't have the thick chewy pieces of tendon which I like, but rather pieces of beef with a little bit of tendon on it.  The spicy garlic eggplant however was amazing. The eggplant was perfectly soft and tender, and the sauce was thick and sweet yet still spicy. As a disclaimer, I really didn't find the food here to be as spicy as I expected, and I don't even consider myself to be someone who can handle a lot of spice. Perhaps because they saw I was white, they automatically made it less spicy, but if I came back I would probably even prefer it a bit more on the spicy side.  Also as a side note, the rice here is really good. I feel like often the rice you get at family style restaurants is dried out and poor quality (like Wonton Gourmet and Siam Cafe) but the rice here was perfect, and if you're a rice lover you'll know exactly what I mean.  The price point I thought was fair for family style dishes- about $8-$16 for these dishes and less for the lunch specials. Pretty comparable to other restaurants in the area.  Overall, I really liked it here, and since it's literally right around the corner from my workplace, I definitely see myself returning quite often!"}
