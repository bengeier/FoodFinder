{"text":"Music was good, lots of hits. There didn't seem to be a designated dance floor but my friends and I just danced around the pool table. The drink menu was awesome, though the shots took a while to arrive after ordering. But the service was friendly and my party of 8 had a blast. They even gave me a complementary shooter for my birthday."}
{"text":"I came here the first time while waiting to go to a wedding reception because we were all in need of alcohol (it was a dry wedding). It looks pretty plain, very simple layout. I ordered their poutine that has everything on it (forgetting the name right now) and it. Was. Delicious. I keep coming back just for this dish.

The staff are okay. One server was cool, but a little too attentive to the point where I had to let her know I would call her if I needed her. I appreciated this, though, so it's not really a bad thing.
Another would just disappear for a while and reappear at the bar to make drinks for the bar patrons, but didn't really check on us too often. I prefer that when I'm dining with someone, but some people might not be okay with that.

Drinks are pretty good, as well. I liked their caramel apple-tini. Beer is nice and cold, and overall fairly priced.

Overall, I love the dish so much that I don't care if the server is awesome or terrible. I plan yo eventually try something else on the menu, but for now this is all I need."}
{"text":"I had their $9.99 buffet (Weekdays and Saturday lunch).

A lot of variety, and I actually enjoyed the food. Service was good too, and interior was fine. What really turned me off were the very, very dirty dishes that had crusted leftovers from its past uses...Gross. Not exaggerating when I say I had to go through 6 plates in the pile of dishes at the buffet area before I finally found one without any dried piece of food...Very unhygenic.

How do they not realise this is an issue that needs to be fixed, when the evidence is so clear and plentiful...

Whatever redeeming qualities they might have, if I feel grossed out and unhygenic, it is an automatic fail."}
{"text":"This place is just strange.

Came in here on what I guess was a pub night for some university. The place was packed and it was a pain to get around.

Server was a bit of a jerk, I ordered a beer from him and he just seemed to roll his eyes at me. I shrugged it off and continued to wait for myf riend. 
When she got there the server seemed to become a lot nicer-not towards me, just to her. Comped her drink, did a shot with her, completely unprofessional. If she was my date or girlfriend I would have been pissed.

The tvs were playing everything so I guess on a big sports night this would be a good place to be, as long as you dont get this server."}
{"text":"This should be your go-to place for watching live skirmishes! Local thugs assaulting decent customers like you an me! what a lovely place this is !!!

I was there the other day minding my own business while an asshole assaulted one of the customers, who was having a problem because apparently his payment didn't go through. The bartender and this customer in question were having an argument, when this asshole (apparently one of the regulars) came out of nowhere and engaged in physical contact with the decent customer, pushing and jabbing him multiple times, all of this to the total inaction of the staff...  Do you like being cowardly assaulted when you go out to grab a pint? I know I don't !!!


Do yourself a favor and don't go anywhere close to this nasty place. It is forbidden.

Everything about this place is nasty...."}
{"text":"While the owner and staff are interested in making the customer happy, the mediocre food and high prices are the likely explanation why at 11:45am the place is empty. Only had a few tables by 12:30.

Everything was really overpriced and the recommended burger just didn't taste good. The portion sizes were big, but still didn't deliver on the taste+quality+price value that I'm looking for. 

This was an average meal at best, and I left having felt ripped off. It's a shame because I really think the owner and staff are interested in providing good service, but they are really lacking quality food that would justify their price point."}
{"text":"Really quick service, great prices , specials, delicious salad, friendly cute bartender and a draw for a BlueJays jersey....now that's a great package!!!"}
{"text":"Yikes. 

This place is umm....special. They overcharged us on our bill and the $5 apps were gross."}
{"text":"this place is absolute joke the staff make up their own rules when to kick people out at end of night when they stop serving was there on Wednesday last call was suppose to be 2am but one drunk idiot was causing problems and bartender said at 115 he done serving for the nite  we all thought he was saying that just to get rid of the guy but after he left he kept his word . I was there on Friday and fuckin waitress just assumed my change was all hers my bill was 44 bucks I gave her 50 . she said sorry just assumed you didn't want change then she was classless by saying keep your change I don't want your change . then she asked me to leave at 215 was not even 2am yet .I told her im almost 40 every bar been to lets u stay to 230 or 245am she  said she was been nice letting me stay to 215 how can u serve alcohol till 2 am and kick everyone out at 215 place really unprofessional staff all drink on the job with customers and everyones bill is written on paper almost like do it save money on taxes    this place should be audited wouldn't be surprised if they don't claim gross income to government what they should be claiming they make no tax on alcohol only food. I told waitress wow really like your job you really make me want to come back she said if more people u all could stay longer but I think was last one she basically belittled me by saying cause just you you need go in next 10 mins last thing she said was doesn't give a shit if I come back or not . thinking maybe of telling owner that bitch should be fired talking to customers like that."}
{"text":"Food was good, nothing extra special, but I enjoyed my burger. The service and atmosphere were forgettable though. I'd definitely go back if in the area, but I don't feel any urgency to do so and wouldn't say it's a must try by any means."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends after we arrived at Panorama to find out it was closed off for a private holiday function.

The place is rather huge.  Its a sports bar.  There is one lonely pool table at the back.  Our server was great and was attentive throughout the evening.  He checked on us at frequent but not annoying intervals.

We ordered a few food items:

Chili Fries
Frings (Onion Rings/Fries)
Calamari
Mozzarella Sticks

Stay away from the fries.  They are all soggy and gross.  Don't order the Frings, because they have an uneven ratio of Onion Rings to Fries.  The mozzarella sticks were saltier than saltines, and the texture of them felt like I was eating rubber.

There are nice bars in the area."}
{"text":"I was in town with my husband and sister & boyfriend for a show at the Panasonic Theatre last night. We went down early to grab a note to eat and thought we would try a local pub instead of the usual restaurants. 
Wow, were we really disappointed. When we walked in, our first impressions were.. \"this place looks really run down and needs a major face lift.\" 

We ordered beers and 2 of them just didnt taste right. My husband sent his beer back with the server she said okay and took it away. She never asked him if he wanted another.  Instead, the bar tender decides to pour him another type of beer and the server gives him this instead. She tells him something might be wrong with the keg, so here's a Buds Light instead. My husband says, \"umm okay, but I never ordered a Buds and you didn't ask me what other beer I wanted.\" We left it at that.. hence making us question about the food we were about to receive.

BAD FOOD.

Wings- were more gooey 
Burger - burnt and dry
Mediterranean - kabob (tandoori) had practiclly no flavour.. very plain.. I could have made this at home much better, salad tasted like some chemical was in it and rice was OK but tasted like Uncle Bens
Chicken Wrap - drenched with sauce, but at least the poutine was good.

Although, the price was decent and the service was OK only.. Overall, our experience was not great. We would not recommend visiting this restaurant. Not worth it. 
To top things off, there was also an altercation between a server and a customer during our visit... so i think you get the point I am trying make.

Visit if you must but don't have high expectations!"}
{"text":"Headline: Good and healthy bar food? SAY WHAT??!
Disclaimer: Review of the 9.95 weekday buffet only

I pass by this place practically everyday and never once thought to go in here as it's a bar and bars don't usually have the best (or healthiest lunch food).  However, as my coworker and I were looking for something different to eat, I saw 9.95 salad bar and Mediterranean lunch buffet.  How do I refuse that?  We went in, checked out what they had and decided to stay. 

Likes: 8-10 different types of salads including tabolueh, pasta salad, beet salad, mushroom salad, etc.  All veggies were very fresh and adding the dressing adds good flavour.  They also had hummus and baba gonoush. They also had butter chicken, some beef and chicken kebobs, mushroom chicken, wings, fried fish, lentil soup, bean soup, spicy chicken and a bunch of other meats in sauce, rice and potatoes.  Waitress and bartender are very friendly. Bar is clean.    

Dislikes: It ruined my pescetarian diet...stupid buffets and their cheap prices and appealing looking food..ugh lol.  Seriously, I liked everything except the dry kebobs because they were a bit too try.  Majority of TV's are located at the bar area, so hard to watch a game while eating. 

Verdict: Good, cheap eat in healthy food during lunch time and also quick.  Need to work this into my weekly rotation."}
{"text":"I've actually never dared to eat there. The general state of the place makes me scared to think of what the kitchen looks like. The whole place smells like moth balls... It needs a serious overhaul!

That being said, I've been here for drinks with a group of friends. When some of us tried to pay our bill to leave, it took ages for the waitress to get each person's bill, which would have been ok if I had had more than ONE drink and if that drink hadn't been pop. It took 15 minutes for me to be able to pay and get out of there.

Didn't want to go there in the first place and probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Last night I joined a meetup group that concluded a two part \"dinner and pub\" event here--it was a great pick!

Basically, this is one of those basic no fuss, no attitude, no drama drinking spots in the city.  Lots of TVs showing sports, a pool table, plenty of seating and an overall spacious feeling--our group had its own space in the back and an excellent server to make sure everyone was well taken care of.

The location can't be beat--right at Yonge and Bloor.

The food looked good--I would like to come back and try something from the kitchen. 

The music could have been louder--at least whatever the jukebox is connected to.  I couldn't here my 15 picks too well.

If you can leave any beer snobbery at the door, you'll be fine with what's on tap here.  The menu features several cocktails although this joint kind of had more of a \"beer feel\" to me.  

Prices were average--about $8 a pint for Mill St. Organic.

Again, the crowd, at least on a Friday night, was low key and zero attitude.  I did not get the sense that it would be the greatest place if you are single and on the prowl; maybe Saturdays are different.  If you are any kind of group, this place is really great.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Mediocre. Bloody Caesar was in a miniature glass and not worth it. Requested olives when I ordered the second drink and got some shrivelled no-name brand looking olives looking like they came straight outa my refrigerator at home. Ordered appetizer and two entrees. Got all three at once and appetizer (mozzarella cheese sticks, jalapeño poppers & Chicken tenders) were all cold on the inside so cheese was solidified. Fish n chips were just okay (menu says fresh but tasted frozen maybe they house batter the fish after it has been thawed?) Cole slaw was very bland. Burger was okay, nothing special. Service was friendly but lacked attention to detail like timing of bringing out food. They weren't busy so not sure why they couldn't have nailed the timing a little better. Will not go back unless I happen to be in the area and I'm thirsty for a beer."}
{"text":"This place is more for drinks than for food. We went to get a bite to eat, and the food was decent but nothing spectacular. My wife got the wrong sauces on her wings and ribs so they re-glazed them with the correct sauces (but didn't actually recook the food). The bartender/waiter was very polite and friendly though."}
{"text":"I've definitely found my new go to pub here in Toronto. Burgs has been around for a while but  rebranded and recently moved to its new location a little further south on Yonge. It was about 11pm on a Friday and was itching for some late night bites. I thought I'd check out Burgs. 

My friend and I were greeted by a lovely elderly woman who gave us our choice of tables. We had a few servers after that, all of whom were great. Plenty on tap, TVs for sports, and prices that you can't really find elsewhere in Toronto. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap with some fries. Hands down one of the best wraps I've ever had, with the perfect mix of buffalo and ranch sauce. Paired with the fries it was a pretty filling meal. The total for 3 drinks and the meal was only $36 (the wrap and fries being $10). 

100% will be going back!"}
{"text":"I think this place is the old burgundy pub that used to be a few stores north of where they currently are.
However if so, they've definitely done a better job.  Much smaller, better layout, and smaller menu...which is key.
The old Burgundy was just huge, waste of space and didn't look like a regular bar lol.
This place has a happy hour special daily $5 per app...so we decided to take a chance and give it a try excluding any potential healthy options.
We ended up ordering their perogies, macaroni and cheese balls, calamari, mozzarella sticks,  and jalapeno poppers.....overall the food was good... but I think I'd have to come back here to give this place a second opinion."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! Severely disappointed with this Torontonian pub landmark.
First off the layout of this place is very dull and it's in major need of a face lift!! The chairs are old, walls need to be painted and unfortunately the place lacks the feeling of a true sports bar. .
The first thing that was very prevalent was the service! It took over 15-20mins for our server to get a pot of tea which cane after finishing up the appetizer lol!!! Yup! My alcoholic drink took approximately 8-10mins.. Not bad for a bar...:(

Apps the Burgundy sampler  was a complete rip off.  The calamari breading was not fresh, half of the breading was coming off in chunks.  The portion and price was a rip off. Complete disappointment. 

It Didn't get any better...Burgundy has a Mediterranean menu so hence I order their sultani.  Keep in mind I've had sultani numerous times at other Mediterranean and Arabic restaurants, but this place totally butchered it.  Lack of flavor in the beef and chicken kebob.  The rice was very bland and overall it was an extremely disappointing meal.  They need to learn how to not only how to properly season this dish, but the presentation was terrible.

I will never come back here.....im sorry.."}
{"text":"Friendly staff but the food is bad. You would figure with a place called, \"Burgs\" they would have great burgers...so not the case. They definitely came from a frozen box and the burger they chose was one of the worst to pick. My burger was over cooked and I waited a good 25 minutes for my burger. I was expecting to be floored. Next time, I'm checking Yelp. Lol...I should've did that before I walked in."}
{"text":"I have been to this place and can state from personal experience that this establishment condones violence between patrons on their premise."}
{"text":"Burger was bad. Meat has a taste of cheap beef. 
Service is good. They have TV's for sports."}
{"text":"Unfortunately our table of seven didn't get the chance to try the food as we couldn't get past the rude and apathetic server. The place is empty and for good reason. The service is poor."}
{"text":"Better than other reviews would have you believe.
Popped in on a Tuesday night...the place was quiet. We were greeted by our waitress and seated right away. She advised us of the daily specials, took a drink order and off she went. When she came back with our drinks, we ordered 2 of the daily cheeseburger specials, with fries (she asked if we wanted salad but who was she kidding...lol)
The burgers came out 20 minutes later and they were fantastic.. ..great taste, huge portion size, with pickles, tomatoes, red onion and shredded lettuce. Fries were excellent.
All in all, a decent experience. Our waitress was very good, food good, reasonable prices.
I'd go back if in the area again."}
{"text":"They've got some pretty good food.

Walked by one day and decided to get my lunch to go.
Ordered the Seafood Pasta with Alfredo sauce. It came with a soup and 2 pieces of break for $17 dollars.

The space looks nice and clean inside and the bar is well stocked."}
{"text":"Great service food and decor. I've been going for years and will continue to go for many more."}
{"text":"Though this place is in dire need of a major overhall, they have awesome 50 cent wings on Monday nights. Cheap and cheerful."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner little over a month ago when I was on a business trip. If i remember correctly, i Had the philly cheesesteak sandwich, and i upgraded my side to a poutine. The food was massive. They also have a decent draft selection.

They have some spinboard where you can spin it and get whatever drink that it lands on.It's not free, but it's just a fun game to do if you're with a group of friends (a group of guys came for a guy's birthday and they were doing it). The staff seems friendly. 

The food was solid..Greasy but solid. It helps to warm you up when the temperature is brisk."}
{"text":"$9.95 lunch buffet was amazing. Lots of choices to choose from and the food is 80% authentic. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of those \"don't judge a book by it's cover\" places. Looks like a plain sports bar, but the food was amazing!! We were a group of four and we had the Latin Combo appetizer platter and the All For One platter...everything was delicious! Our mains didn't disappoint either. Would definitely go back...reasonably priced too!"}
{"text":"was having a chicken caesar in the bar,last saturday night.first time visiting,was not a bad experience especially since the waitress was kinda cute.chicken caesar was excellient and done the way i told them tomade up my mind to go check it out again soon."}
{"text":"Like a sports bar swapped kitchens with a Mediterranean place. 

It isn't classy, but it's good. 

Some reviewers criticized the old furnishings, but I think that they're sort of endearing. And it WAS nice to watch the game and eat healthy skewers of delicious meat. The server was chatting on the phone loudly to her boss (I think) half the time, but it was kind of fun, because she had attitude and personality."}
{"text":"After work my sister and I were looking for some greasy grub in the yonge and bloor area when a blackboard listing daily specials calls my name \"Cuban Pulled Pork\" BINGOO......although the Pork sandwich wasn't today's special I had high hopes it would be on the regular menu none the less......and it was!
(I later found out that the daily specials are just regular menu items featured at a discounted price...about a $1 off)

The decor in this place is completely outdated.....they desparately need restaurant make over to knock on there door. It has an early 90's feel, its dark and dingy with pool tables in the back and a long bar along one side and tables on the other. However what it lacks in beauty it tremendously makes up in Taste.....food taste that is!

That fact that they had Cuban Pulled Pork in the first place blew my mind.
And it was Delicioussss. Chunky pieces of smokey pulled pork piled high on a freshly baked pretzel bun with tangy mustard and dill pickle and coleslaw providing the perfect balance to sweet meat.

We also got Smoked Roast Beef au Jus which was also really good! Real slow roasted beef with a smokey flavour sliced thin and stacked high with melted swiss cheese piled on a fresh baked baguette. Another winner.

And the Fries......... oooo the fries were sooo goood!!! They make their own fresh cut fries and boy you can totally tell the difference! Perfectly cooked golden brown not overly crispy but not too soft just perfect!!

Service also great! Although it wasn't very busy when we were there our waiter gave us plenty of time, checked on us regularly, filled our water, and even brought us a selection of hot sauces.

Don't let the decor get the best of you here Try the awesome sandwiches that are served on fresh baked breads and the Grrreat Fries and friendly service!"}
