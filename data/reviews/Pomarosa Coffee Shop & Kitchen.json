{"text":"Delicious fresh and flavour packed food, friendly staff and a pleasant atmosphere. Love this place."}
{"text":"Delicious arepas that are big and filling. Smoothies and coffee were also delicious. Staff was very friendly and the place is very modern and clean. Would definitely go back and try the scones everyone keeps talking about!"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and tried almost everything, it's all mind blowing and amazing. All the arepas are super unique and flavorful, and the sauces are on point."}
{"text":"Everything here is amazing - delicious arepas (both veggie and meat options), scrumptious baked goods (guava white cheddar scones!), smoothies that actually taste good (so light and cloud-like!), great coffee and the friendliest staff. Breakfast arepas are also excellent.  Definitely one of the more unique businesses in the neighbourhood and a welcome addition. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place has the best food! The Arepas are outstanding (must have with the house made sauce) and I had a guava and cheese scone there which was possibly the best scone I've ever eaten. The decor is pretty casual - more of a cafe vibe. The people who work there all seem really lovely. So glad it opened!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD! Such a nice addition to the neighbourhood. The arepas were delicious - we had one pulled pork, one chicken that we shared... Great coffee and we split a banana/nutella cupcake for dessert. Will head back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I had the best scone ever-  guava and cheese. I also loved my cappuccino!! New place that makes arepas...will try next time."}
{"text":"This place has delicious arepas and delightful coffee. I tried la culpa es de la vaca + a Rosa Latte and I enjoyed every single bite of this delicious meal. Amazing service and beautiful decoration. We needed this spot at the danforth. Don't forget to try the scones."}
