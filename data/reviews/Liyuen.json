{"text":"The best wings in Phoenix.  Yes at the \"Westside Window\".  Don't let the exterior scare you off.  You have to try the jalapeño wings."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this restaurant for years my kids grew up knowing it as the seventh Avenue window they are amazing and when you call they know you by your name as well as what you usually order"}
{"text":"The classic hole in the wall. I love this place! Please note cash only and take out only as well no dining area. I advise to call ahead as wait time could be lengthy. I love the jalapeno wings..shrimp fried rice combo..."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant at first considering you order through a walk up window with bars but Liyuen exceeded my expectations. I had the jalapeño wings with shrimp fried rice and it was delish. I will definitely be back next time I'm downtown."}
{"text":"They have the best Jalapeño wings, French fries and shrimp fried rice! Reasonably priced food! The sloppy bags are pretty good too! I often order the jalapeño and hot oil on the side to enjoy with French fries!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews and noticed that the Wings were very popular. So I decided to try............. I am So glad I did. I had the Jalapeno Wings and Fries with and order of Egg rolls.. A ton of food I could barely finish...... Wings were juicy and the Hand Made EggRolls were AWESOME. Do not over look this place. It is a hole in the wall(the place you order your food is an actual hole in the wall) but well worth it."}
{"text":"This is the OG spot, the real deal, you can't beat that lunch special, egg foo yung is"}
{"text":"I love so called \"quick wok\" places. Yum. Ordered the Mongolian chicken combo. Portion is silly huge and tasty. I will be happy to take leftovers home. This was my first time there today and not my last. Remember cash only for you newbies......"}
{"text":"Our office has enjoyed team lunch from Liyuen on two occasions, and the food is delish! We really enjouy the jalapeno wings and shrimp fried rice combo. The egg fu young won rave reviews as well. Will definitely return. This is a take-out, cash only, walk up to a barred window establishment in a not great area, but worth the trip for lunch!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!  Very sketchy place with a bar window where you order and get your food.  However some of the best Chinese food in the valley if you can bring yourself to get past the hole in the wall appearance."}
{"text":"Amazing Chinese food. Spicy wings and shrimp fried rice. The food was flavorful and delicious. It was still hot when we got back to the hotel room. Cooked fresh! Can't wait to visit Arizona again."}
{"text":"First off, this place is in a not so nice area. That being said, the food is actually good! I order the fried chicken wings and a large shrimp fried rice. The chicken wings are piping hot! It was nice crispy with the right amount of salt. The shrimp fried rice was on point. The rice was not to salty and there was just the right amount of shrimps to rice ratio.   The only downside to this place is you have to order your food outside. And since it's summer in PHoenix, it's kind of hot.   And added note, this restaurant is to go only and cash only."}
{"text":"What I affectionately call \"Ghetto Chinese Food\" or \"Chinese Soul Food\" if you prefer.   Here are the essential characteristics of Ghetto Chinese Food, in my opinion:  cheap; decent (not good or bad) cuts of meat; huge portions; a tad greasy but not so much; questionable neighborhood; suspicious looking customers; served out of a hole in the wall; and lots of chicken wings on the menu (i.e. fried, buffalo, jalapeno, garlic or BBQ).   This place has it all; that is why I give Liyuen five stars, because as far as Ghetto Chinese Food goes, this place is as good as it gets!  I have had the egg foo young, several chicken dishes, the egg rolls, shrimp fried rice and the chicken wings. I've enjoyed it all.  I will  be back, especially when I want to eat a ton of food for six bucks.  If you like this place try Tam's."}
{"text":"The food is FIRE! You get the most out of your money, everything is really good. Whenever I'm in south phx I come here! Best Chinese food!!"}
{"text":"The best in ARIZONA PERIOD!!! Reasonable price and the taste soooooooooooooooooooooo goooooddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddffcccccccccccccc"}
{"text":"I don't know what all the fuss is about...drove 30 miles out of our way to pick up diner at this place and was really disappointed.  VERY long wait for the food and there were only a couple people there picking up food. Several others came while we waited the over half hour for the food to be ready. A very rough customer base and not the best part of town to be hanging out on a street corner for 45 minutes.  Food was lacking flavors and the jalapeno chicken wings were not crispy and dripping with oil. There was a huge pool of oil in the bottom which made the fried rice really oily.  The girl I ordered from was all business, not friendly, and offered no assistance when ordering from the vast menu.  Would get an order of fried rice if I was in the area but would certainly not go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Tons of food for cheap! Decent taste and not over powering sauce. Please note: cash only."}
{"text":"First time and I went solely based on the reviews! I ordered the Jalapeno Wing Combo with Shrimp Fried Rice and the Vegetable Egg Foo Young Combo. I called ahead and my order was ready upon arrival (approx. 20mins). Everything tasted delicious and fresh! They were nice big healthy portions. I was able to feed my 4 little kids and myself and still have leftovers. I will definitely return as GOOD Chinese food is not easy to find. Yes all the reviews about the small window and it not being the greatest location are true, but it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"I had to try this place because I always see people outside and figured I would give it a try.  I am not impressed and wouldn't go out of my way to go eat here . The people in line all seemed to love it so I have to say I was excited to try it out. My food was not that good at all. I got kung poa chicken and the chicken had ALOT of fat on it and they hardly put any in the dish. I watched a guy bring chicken wings back up because he wanted them crispy and they were not crispy at all. The lady argued with him telling him they are well done that he can buy more if he wants them more done. I was sitting their like are you kidding me... if you had cooked them right the first time he shouldn't have to buy more.  Any place that has that type of business model deserves no business."}
{"text":"This place is straight up hood.  I turned down the street and a dog was just running around. my heart broke for that dog for the rest of the night :( I wanted to take him home, clean him up and give him to someone for christmas.   I see this graffiti covered building. only, not really a building because there wasn't a door. just a tiny window. not just any window, but a bullet proof one. with prison bars on the outside? ummmm.......  the back doubled as a junk yard. vacuum? check. gnome? check. stray dog? random couch? check. check.  my friend shouts- this is it!!!! here it is!!! I'm so excited!!!   uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh   there were a lot of people hanging by this 'window', they were perhaps homeless?? convicts? i don't know.  but this place works like this: walk up to the window, place your order, and wait.   my friend was like 'im not bringing my whole purse up there, i don't want to get pick pocketed.' so I said, 'ok, i'll bring mine. it doubles as a weapon'. and we made our way up to the window.  the food was dirt cheap- we got two eggrolls, chicken fried rice, spicy chicken dinner, and 12 wontons and diet coke. we spent a total of $16.  The food was A-OK and while we waited even more people came to the window. this place was hoppin.  the fried rice was the best- it was super buttery and i loooovvveee butter. the chicken was plain old breaded and fried w a glossy 'spciy' (not really at all) sauce. the fried wontons were just decent, and the eggrolls were delish. but this is not a place i would come back to. for fear of being robbed.   call me angel princess, but i couldn't get over the 'ambiance' to chow down and not think twice about what type of quality meat i was eating at such cheap prices...  try it if you're brave because it was definitely tasty for the price....i think...."}
{"text":"WOW!WOW!WOW! this review is for the wings(i will never order anything else). This was my first time and was recommended by a coworker to get the Jalapeno Wings and the Shrimp Fried Rice combo. Yes it was $9 but totally worth it. Trust me i've had the claimed \"best\" chinese wings in both San Francisco and New York, but this place just knocks them out of the ballpark. The wings are amazingly tasty, spicy and addicting. Yes they are greasy but thats whats so good. this is not you every day food maybe not even your weekly, and maybe not even once a month meal. Im sure it packs calories, way too many. But its just comforting to eat this. Its a huge portion of both wings and rice, so you will have leftovers. The rice was quite good, probably in contention for the best fried rice i have ever had.  The only thing i didnt like was the .50 cent charge for hot sauce. good thing i have my own at work and didnt have to buy some. P.S - dont be scared of the place. its totally worth it."}
{"text":"Yaaaaaaaaaaaas lin hunney!!!  We have been there for a week straight the flavors are amazing and the little lady has been there for years she's so sweet and a Knows my uh by by heart lol so she already knows his order has not a big fan of change and by the looks of it neither are they"}
{"text":"The food here is incredible good. They have lunch combos that are amazing. My favorites are the shrimp fried rice, chicken lo mein, Kung pao chicken and their wings are so tasty."}
{"text":"Shady AF but some of the best Chinese food I've ever had anywhere (San Fran included)"}
{"text":"Seriously the best Chinese food ever. Amazing quality and it is always made fresh. Huge portions and very quality ingredients. Walk up window and cash only."}
{"text":"The best teriyaki chicken ever!!!! Bomb wings, orange chicken, house fried rice, all the food is bomb!"}
{"text":"If you're a pasty suburbanite like me, then this is not only a tasty meal but also doubles as fulfilling your New Year's resolution for getting outside of your comfort zone more.   After missing the turn and being entirely unsure of where to park I finally approached the barred window on the side of the building. I took in the sights of the small auto yard across the street and tried not to lean on the owner's van parked adjacent to the order window.  The woman who took my order, I'm assuming the owner, was very friendly. We bonded over being from California and the oppressive heat. Deserts, am I right?  I ordered the lunch combo and what I thought was a side order of orange chicken. I was so, so wrong.   The lunch combo was enormous. Delicious fried rice, plentiful fried pork and slightly disappointing lo-mein. The spring roll was excellent. The orange chicken was a combo itself, providing the same huge portions for a fantastic price.  The next time I'm feeling like a minor thrill I'll be sure to visit again."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent food.  It is literally a hole in the wall and i swear i was back home in west philly going to a Chinese food place due to the small window and bars....    but the food is outstanding!  Great find."}
{"text":"Despite feeling like you might get carjacked, stabbed or robbed every second while waiting for your food, this place is excellent!  To avoid a wait while outside of their window, I suggest  calling ahead, however, you can walk up and order.  Usually the gal who answers says it'll be 10 minutes...be prepared for a 20-25 minute wait at times.  I am a fan of the veggie egg fu young, steamed broccoli, sesame chicken, orange chicken, egg drop soup sans chicken, french fries, fried mushrooms (these are huge, like as big as tomatoes)..the list goes on.  Their combo plates have fed our family of four when we've also added an appetizer.  It's truly some of the best Chinese I've had in downtown Phoenix.  I'd equate this place to any dive Chinese joint in a large city like NY, Chicago, etc.  It looks totally unappealing but is a treasure! I have never seen anything bad happen here but  I always wear closed-toe shoes and have my hair pulled back when going here.......It seems less scary during the daytime and when the guys who work at the car repair shop right across the street are still around which I have seen be as late as 8.  Please give this little place a shot and, remember, it's cash only!!  And, there's no ATM on site either."}
{"text":"Meh. Totally and completely meh. I really have no idea why this is so highly rated. The chicken was OK, not great but OK, and there wasn't any of it."}
{"text":"Our office did a Chinese take out day from Liyuen.  I got the sesame chicken from the lunch special menu.  I have to say, you get a huge portion of food:  egg roll, wonton, fried rice, and sesame chicken.  Like two meals in one.  The food is tasty but the sesame chicken sauce was a tad too sweet for me.  I would try it again when the office does another Chinese take out run."}
{"text":"o.m.g.....thats all i can say....... best chinese food in phoenix!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going for years and I have to say it is one of my favorite Chinese take out places. Closest I get to NY take out. The owner is a wonderful lady who has a sharp memory for who you are and what you order."}
{"text":"The best hole in the wall Chinese food. The jalapeño wings are the best and the food is always made to order. When you call to make a phone order, they never begin to make your food until you show up, so don't be in a rush. It normally takes about 10-20 mins to get in and out typically, which isn't too bad."}
{"text":"Totally a hole in the wall, but if you want the best bang for the buck, the lunch specials are huge and cheap. Everything is fresh, vegetables are always perfect and not soggy. Cash only establishment but great family business. Have ordered here a few times for lunch in the last few years and had decent food. I think they have the best fried rice and egg rolls in town."}
{"text":"I'm a east coast transplant, which i can say, the Chinese food out here is nothing compared to back home. This is where Liyuens comes into place. By far the best Chinese food  I've had in Phoenix. I go here at least twice a month due to them being inexpensive and close to central Phoenix . Bring cash because that is all they accept. Trust me folks, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"They do not accept credit cards. There is no place to sit. I'm not sure the seriously dry and soggy sesame chicken is in fact  chicken... the fried rice was subpar was that white stuff supposed to be shrimp? The service there also sucked. This place is literally a shack, dead smack in the middle of the hood... which is cool and all but at least have some decent Chinese food.. sheesh.. usually hole in the Wall places that only accept cash have the best food.. this place does not.  Sorry. I don't get the hype...  Signed,  a New Yorker"}
{"text":"Very cheap a lot of food for your money, tried chicken wings, lo mein ,chow fen(rice noodles), orange chicken ,and shrimp fried rice everything was good. Takeout only"}
{"text":"Sabrina!!!!!! Westside window is the bomb love the house fried rice and the crab puffs"}
{"text":"Wow...I mean, WOW!  Just a huge, overly on purpose, extremely melodramatically emphasized, WOW!!!!   Why?  Because they deserve it.  And yes, it's in the \"hood\" and so what??  This is a legit little Chinese eatery that makes the best, smokiest fired rice I've had in I can't remember.  And I've had some pretty damn good fried rice but this place is just sick off the charts frigg'en amazing.  And the egg foo young??  Forget about it.    I had to try this place before I left town and I'm so glad, so so glad I did.  What a gem!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the sweet and sour combo, this place is not for me  when I got home its was soggy - the fired rice with chicken had some pale chicken on it looked so white and unseason it looked like pork and looked like uncooked chicken- everyone else likes it people who go there drive from far apparently not sure why- go to China chilli it's x 10 better - oh had crab puff they had some almost custard texture thing in it instead of crab or cream cheese almost threw up trying"}
{"text":"This place is good. The fried chicken & shrimp fried rice is really good. It's in a sketchy area & they only take cash which is a bummer."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food I have had in a while! The Jalapeño Chicken wings and shrimp fried rice is delicious. The place was scary at first, but the staff was very friendly. The food made up for the traffic.  Oh, the shelves behind the lady is extremely funny. You pick from rolled papers (first shelve), cigarettes ( second shelves), condoms (third shelve), and children's snacks (fourth shelve). LOL."}
{"text":"Take a look at the menu and decide what you should eat. If you want to improve the quality of your life, just order the Y4 combo of jalapeno chicken wings with shrimp fried rice.   They accept cards now as well. Life gets better."}
{"text":"Love places like this I always get the A4 A1 or 15 the chicken is on point food is very good despite the look and walk up window but that's what I like about this place. Don't be scared food is worth it"}
{"text":"If you've been looking for bomb Chinese, this is it. It's a hole in the wall, cash only place. We've gone twice in one week now. The shrimp fried rice, and kung pao chicken are sooo good. The crab puffs tasted like sweet cream cheese. The egg rolls were so so. All in all, go try it. Don't judge it by the surroundings."}
{"text":"Woah baby this place is fiya they sell everythang in there this place don't get the appropriation that it deserve food is off the gang bang chain ima be back again very soon speedy friendly service to stay opened forever please"}
{"text":"Good bike cafe. Kombucha is amazing and the drinks are so unique and original. Owner is a very king and gentle spirit. Very cool and open to telling his bike stories. Amazing amazing."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food. If you like hole in the wall spots but good eating, this is it. I had low mein with chicken, sweet and sour pork, rice and spicy chicken. The chicken is VERY spicy but a little bland in season, it's just very hot but otherwise everything was good, I'd go back. Order ahead as they are a little slow as they cook to order."}
{"text":"Today I decided to look for something rather unique and found this place with pretty good reviews hence inspiring me to partake in its delicacies. The place is a cash only window so I ran under the optimistic assumption that the food must be rather legendary, I picked up my meal and even though I felt rather unsafe the hunger drove me to overcome any obstacles in my way. Upon arriving home and eating the meal I was highly disappointed by the combo appetizer which was full of chicken wings which did not appeal. Upon the sight I chose to move onto eating the crab puffs and came to the shocking realization that there was no puff inside the crab puff, it just appeared puffy on the outside yet it was empty on the inside. Overall far from the best Chinese dining experience."}
{"text":"I ordered the Orange Chicken combo & a Black Pepper Shrimp combo. The Orange Chicken combo was in a darker sauce than I've ever had. It was ok, I would not order it again. The Black Pepper Shrimp combo was tastier. It was layered thick with black pepper. The location of the restaurant is as stated: Cash Only! Those two order's took about 20-minutes. So, if your not driving, you want to be careful walking around that area...The Cashier was very friendly and had a great welcoming smile...The only menu is the one posted on the window of the restaurant."}
{"text":"This little hole-in-the-wall Chinese take-out has the best Chinese food . The shrimp in the dishes are big and not the little cocktail shrimp. And, they know how to make egg foo young. Which in Phoenix is hard to find."}
