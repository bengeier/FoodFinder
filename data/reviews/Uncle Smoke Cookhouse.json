{"text":"Super great! Cornbread and brisket were amazing, mac and cheese and slaw were also very good. Ordered off Uber Eats and everything came nicely packaged. Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Came for the ribs, returned for the brisket!
It may have taken a while but I have finally found the best BBQ in Toronto. The smell of the smokers flowing in from the back as well as the delicious looking gooey butter squares on the counter were enough to keep me distracted while my food was prepared. Mostly takeout with the option for about 8-10 people to sit in. Great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Love the brisket. And the ribs. And the wings. And the salads. And the slaw. And everything! Plus the guys who work there are so nice. And you can't miss the gooey butter squares for dessert. Great prices too!!"}
{"text":"Waiting time was too long for food that was not fresh at all. I caught a sneak of the kitchen and it looked very disorganized and messy. Food is very expensive when you look at the quality and quantity. The worst bbq I have ever had in my entire life. Save your time and money and get Tim Hortons or McDonald's instead."}
{"text":"I had the burger and potato salad. The burger was absolutely delicious. The service was very friendly and fast as well. These guys definitely know how to cook some cow."}
{"text":"We called in a pickup order shortly after they opened on a Saturday and it was ready 15 minutes later (lots of parking across the street FYI).  The food was absolutely delicious.  We order the 1/2lb of pulled pork, 1/2lb of brisket and potato wedges (~$36 total).  We thought the portions looked small when we opened everything up but we were absolutely stuffed after the two of us ate half the food.

The brisket was some of the best I've ever had.  It was so juicy and tender, with good chunks of fat still attached.  The pork melted in your mouth.  And the potato wedges were soooooo good.  Crispy on the oustide, fluffy on the inside, perfectly seasoned and gigantic!  The sauce was great too.

Can't wait to come back to try some of the other items.  I was very impressed!"}
{"text":"Uncle Smoke delivers the goods. Everything is made with care and their brisket is always the best."}
{"text":"I didn't think I liked BBQ. Boy, was I wrong!. I had the fried chicken sandwich and the meat was juicy. There was a bit of heat, not too spicy, but just right. The bun was fresh and they make it house. The mac and cheese was delicious, as were the fries and cornbread. My friend had the burger and said it was the best in the city. Friendly staff and good portions. I left happy and full."}
{"text":"Great place. I've been meaning to go with my boyfriend since the place opened. He literally walks by it everyday. 

I surprised him today by texting him to meet me at Uncle Smoke's...we ordered the 2 meats plus 3 sides. It was really good and super fresh. 

The beef brisket literally fell apart if you even slightly touched it with the fork and the crispy chicken...waaaaaaaaayyyyy better than KFC or any other fried chicken I've had. 

For our sides, we got the fried green tomatoes (which was the daily house special) and it was my first time trying it. LOVED IT.  We also got the Mac and cheese (it was good but not great) and the slaw (which I loved). 

Definitely coming back again. I heard they're starting to serve breakfast tomorrow...yummy!"}
{"text":"Very good wings, but I feel like they shortchange you.
When I went to pick up my \"two pound\" to-go bag, I yanked it up into the air because I know what two pounds of wings should feel like. I don't believe they actually put a pound of meat in the fryer when you order a pound of wings. According to a paper called \"Cost and yield of ready-to-eat chicken products\" published by the University of Texas Agricultural Extension, a pound of raw chicken drumsticks shrink down 23% by weight when deep fried. Wings shrink 20%. They're between a third and a half bone, after all, so there isn't that much moisture to sizzle away in the first place. 78% of 2 pounds is 25 ounces. Uncle Smoke served waaay less, only 18.3 ounces, according to my new Amazon Basics kitchen scale. Even with smoking taking out another ounce of water, I think they're shorting customers by about 25%, give or take. Starbucks lost a class action lawsuit for under filling cups by a lot less than that.
So I give this place five stars for flavor, as the wings are actually friggin' delicious, but only two stars for honesty in marketing. I will try them again in the future and if this was an isolated incident, I'll change my review."}
{"text":"Today is the last day for UberEats Week specials!

Uncle Smoke BBQ had a $5 Mac and Cheese special for lunch. 

It was a satisfying appetizer, probably a slightly smaller portion as it was an Uber special.
The meat was savoury and well-balanced with the sweet BBQ sauce.
Not too greasy and overpowering in flavour, it could've used more BBQ sauce. 

A great snack :)"}
{"text":"I'm not a picky eater and rarely complain, but WOWZA. Ordered from UberEATS and had the worst food experience ever. 

- Mac and cheese was mushy, like the noodles were not even noodle-like... if I wasn't told what I was eating I would have guessed it was potato salad, (but a terrible potato salad)... pure mush!

- Cornbread was stale and the \"honey butter\" it was supposed to come with was plain butter

- Coleslaw was dry 

- Pulled pork had a weird smell, and also very dry

- Wings were ok... small and dry, but I ate them... I had to eat something

Don't waste your time here, peeps. Yuck!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times now and it hasn't disappointed. The staff are very friendly and helpful, and the food is delicious. Of note are the smoked bacon, the pulled chicken, the cornbread, and the insanely addictive dessert squares (which the staff affectionately/aptly refer to as \"crack squares\"). Their BBQ sauce is awesome too, and they serve Propeller coffee! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ordered via foodora portions were way too small, ordered brisket cornbread and butter square. Didn't get it. Made a claim.
Could do alot better for the prices being charged here."}
{"text":"So here's the deal:

There's so many BBQ places in this area (I was honestly surprised) and I really didn't know where to start. Uncle Smoke Cookhouse was one of the first few places I was able to dive into and I think they've set a pretty good standard.

The first time, I had their brisket plate. It's almost the standard thing I get when I'm on the lookout for BBQ. The brisket is pretty tender, with just the right amount of tug. It's got a good smokiness and paired with one of their three BBQ sauces, really hits the spot. I recommend the darkest one there! The brisket plate comes with brisket (obviously...), your choice of side, a pickle wedge, and a slice of cornbread.

Round two was the pulled pork sandwich. Overall I was pretty satisfied with it. Perhaps the time I had it, the pulled pork was shredded a bit too much and the texture felt a little off because of it. A little less shredding would've done it for me.

Oh, the fries.... first thing I recall when I took a bite was... it takes like Five Guys' fries! Definitely a plus for me! Crispy, with the right amount of seasoning on it. I could eat a huge bowl of it. No regrets.

I'm rooting for this place though.

Only because it's the closest one to work. Ha."}
{"text":"Ordered on Uber eats.... Way over priced considering the portion size. Paid 73 bucks for enough food for maybe 1 hungry person. Cornbread wasn't good. Tasted prepackaged and microwaved"}
{"text":"This is a tiny place at Bloor and Dundas West. There's a hightop table with 8 stools and seating for another 4 at the front window. I suppose this place is really more of a take-out joint.

The ribs were just OK. The BBQ sauce was just OK. The mac n cheese was subpar.

Frankly, I'm surprised this place made the top ten list of best rib places in town. Maybe we caught them on an off night."}
