{"text":"I REALLY wanted to like this place.   However, it was very disappointing. Went there twice. First time was ok. I tried to sandwiches and they were quite mediocre, although the chips are tasty. I thought I would give it another try because like I said, I REALLY wanted to like this place.  Second time I went I ordered fondue. Took about an hour for it to come out, after I was told it would take 45 minutes and even though the menu says 20 minutes. It tasted very strongly of alcohol so I asked the waitress if we could get something else instead. It was also way more watery than it should have been. I was told that they use the same recipe with every batch.  She consulted with the owner who was sitting at a table behind us doing paperwork.   After they had a lengthy conversation right next to us (very uncomfortable), she came back and said, we can take half off the price and you can order something else but you have to pay for it. So basically we had to pay for food we did not want. On top of that the owner didn't even bother to talk to us even though he was right. there.    We figured if we had to eat it anyway maybe they could add some more cheese to the fondue. To their credit, they did. But we had to wait another 20 minutes. Still tasted gross. But we stomached a little bit of it. Went to pay and told the waitress we wished we had a better experience as I lived nearby and wanted to be a regular. She called over the owner and he finally found the time to speak with us (place was empty). When we gave him feedback he was very dismissive. He said we could get 20% off our meal, while the waitress had told us 50%. I was appalled.   Very poor experience. As an owner you should recognize potential revenue and not scoff in its face. I won't be going back and I am sad about it. If I had been treated a little bit better I would have tried again.  Customer service goes a long way and because there was a lack of it, they have lost a customer who would have surely been a regular.   Fondue - 0/10 (\"grilled veggies\" means some potatoes and a few pieces of cauliflower)  Grilled cheese sandwiches - 4/10  Service - 3/10"}
{"text":"I really don't know what to say. We view Cheesewerks as our neighbourhood joint. From my birthday party last year when the Big Cheese was so incredibly accommodating, and basically let my bf reserve out the whole place, to our regular appearances for Food Fight Trivia Night.  I've never had a bad meal. Ever. And for gourmet grilled cheese, stuffed with so many locally sourced ingredients and awesome, what's not to love.  It's truly family owned and operated  - come by and say hi to Kev, the Big Cheese."}
{"text":"Wow, did you pay to remove my review? I'll put it again, had food poisoning after eating at Cheesewerks.  Instead of removing my post, why don't you think about how to sanitize your food."}
{"text":"This was an impromtu meal. I needed a quick to-go dinner and remembered they did sandwiches with gluten-free bread.   There were only 3-4 tables with people. Yet, I waited at least 20 minutes from my meal to-go. It appeared the woman taking the orders, was also serving and doing some prep of the actual meals (making drinks, prepping the chips and pickle).   For that reason alone, I probably won't go back for a to-go meal or if I'm really hungry.   I ordered the original grilled cheese on gluten free bread. It was definitely a good sandwich. I also ordered one of the ketchups (roasted garlic/red pepper). The ketchup (which they charge extra for which I think is a rip off) was not something I would recommend ordering. It didn't have much flavour at all - couldn't really taste the garlic.   For the food alone I was give this place a three star (if the sandwiches were beefed up (not literally, but a little more cheese/toppings), but with the slow service and cost I give it a two. I think they need to work out labour operations (perhaps more people and everyone knows what their role is) so people are not waiting so long. I also think some of the extras should be included (like ketchup)."}
{"text":"Really great grilled cheese.  Fun concept. Love that everything is local. Go Canadian farmers!  Staff are super nice.  Kinda expensive though. Should have regular ketchup available and shouldn't charge for it. Ketchup is a part of the grilled cheese experience!!"}
{"text":"This place is so friendly. Seems a real family business. They're always good to recommend things. They have board games available to play too, lots of good choices. Sandwiches are great. Once I ordered and didn't notice it had blue cheese (I rush-read), and I couldn't take more than a bite, and I felt so bad but they made me another sandwich no problem. They have trivia and bingo nights too! Also the mac and cheese is to die for."}
{"text":"I love cheese and when I found out about this place I knew I HAD to go there.   I ordered the Picton grilled cheese and it was so yummy I could eat like 5 of them. Bonus points because the order also came with potato chips. Really loved it and would totally go there again.  Only giving 4/5 stars because I didn't spend too much time there and had to get my order to go because I had to run, but really good comfy food."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've tried their quesadilla and now, the Houston Mac n cheese and both were great! The pasta was cooked perfectly, not too soft. I can't wait to try it for brunch one day too!"}
{"text":"I love grilled cheese sandwiches. At home, it's usually Kraft Singles and a couple of pieces of bacon slapped between two slices of Wonderbread or whatever generic brand they sell at No Frills - nothing fancy.  So you can imagine the intrigue - and skepticism - Cheesewerks posed when I first learned about it.  Before this experience, the only time I've paid for a grilled cheese sandwich was at a school cafeteria and a greasy spoon for office workers - nothing fancy.  At Cheesewerks, I ordered the original with bacon and a lemonade. With tax, the bill came to about $15. Bad sign: when I first laid eyes on it and thought, \"That's it?\"  Don't get me wrong, it was a good sandwich. Greasy and small, but good. But was it worth $10? (Extra cost of bacon included). Not a chance.  Will I go back? Probably not. I just can't justify the cost when there are so many menu options elsewhere that are the same price and even better/filling.  The lemonade ($3 for a glass) was so-so."}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service, clean and comfy decor, and delicious fresh-made food. I brought some leftover ham for turkey amnesty day, and they turned it into a delicious, cheesy, amazing bowl of mac 'n cheese. Shelves of board games, a great vibe and fondue nights... Next time, I'm bringing friends!"}
{"text":"It is hard finding a good grilled cheese sandwich so I was happy to discover Cheesewerks. I had the regular grilled cheese with bacon and it was delicious and greasy (but in a totally good way).  I was so enthralled that I couldn't help but make sounds of pleasure as I ate. I just wish I lived closer by."}
{"text":"Just like another reviewer I went here with my wife to redeem a voucher for a 4 course cheese meal. I have tried a few grilled chess places but this ended up being WAY better than any other Cheese place I have been.  The server explained their philosophy: the want to be thought of as a cheese house. The same way people go to a steak house for steak, they want people to satisfy their cheese cravings in their house.  So with that the meal started.  The first course we has a double blend of cheese grilled on sourdough and a shot of thick tomato soup. There was a definite attention to detail as it wasn't just grilled cheese and tomato soup. Both were some of the best seasoned and flavoured of each I have ever had.   Second course was fondue. Gooey and delicious. We wiped the bowl clean with the bread.  Third course. The Beijing Mac and Cheese: BBQ Pork, Asiago and Hoisen sauce.  Very good, but to be honest, the hoisen somewhat threw off the flavour.  The final course was a surprise. Desert grilled cheese. Yes, I kid you not, desert grilled cheese. Marscapone cheese with your choice of candy bar grilled into the bread and topped with maple syrup and strawberries. Honestly, this shouldn't work. We picked a Kit Kat and decided to give it a go. It was awesome. Yes it makes no sense, but it was awesome. Delicious beyond expectation.  Yes, this was a lot of cheese. A bit much actually. But its definitely worth visiting again...maybe not for 4 courses."}
{"text":"Food is above par and there homemade sodas were awesome I had a regular grill cheese can't really go wrong with that but the sodas are a very nice touch."}
{"text":"Got the buffalo chicken grilled cheese. It was decent but for the 16 dollar price I expected more. Mostly just buffalo sauce and a few sparsely placed pieces of chicken. Ketchup is extra, home made or not that's just not me."}
{"text":"Maybe this place would be better if it had more food traffic.  They're not serving brunch anymore either.  We had the grilled cheese, it was alright but not amazing."}
{"text":"Boy, did I have high hopes for this place! I'm really torn about how to review it so I'll just start writing.   Before I begin I want to say one thing: we ended up at Cheesewerks because we purchased a buytopia deal for a 4 course pre-fixe menu with wine allegedly \"valued at $96.\"  So I went into this experience assuming I'd receive $96 worth of food, atmosphere, and service. In fact, it came significantly closer to the $45 we paid for the \"deal.\"  If we had stopped in for lunch... I probably would have been much happier. But I felt duped.  So, the good: - The grilled cheese (our first course) was quite tasty and grown up. It came with tomato soup which was also tasty, but much closer to a watery sauce than soup.  - The owner was super nice and is really into supporting local and Canadian businesses. I like that, but unfortunately not enough to overcome everything else. - The fondue (2nd course) was also good. Not amazing, but good.  The not-so-good: - The mac and cheese (3rd course) was a small-ish portion and had some different flavor profiles. I appreciated the creativity, but it made it too sweet. and honestly, mac-n-cheese is one of those things you just don't mess around with too much. It wasn't cheeeeesy enough. - The cheesecake (4th course) was dry and had too much crust... again, not cheesy enough!  The ugly: - We were having a crazy day and running a little behind, so we called to ask if we could push our reservation from 7 to 7:30. We were answered with a very quick \"out of the question\" and told there was no room. So we rushed and discovered THIS WAS SOOOO not true!! Throughout our entire meal, until the second we left, at least 50% of the tables were open.  - There is no way that the meal we received would have cost almost $100, I don't see any benefit to tricking potential customers like that.   The building itself, with an entire wall of windows and an industrial feel, reads more like a lunch joint than an intimate fondue evening kind of place.   I would definitely recommend the place for a quick lunch or to purchase some cheese, but it's probably not ideal if you're looking for a nice evening and a pricey dinner."}
{"text":"Went to Cheesewerks on opening day. Though the line was crazy, it moved fast. The original grilled cheese was tasty. We returned on Monday to try a specialty sandwich. I ordered the New York which says it involves spicy pastrami.. not spicy at all. Though it was decent, it wasn't the best I've had. No complaints on the Rustic tomato soup. My friend ordered the Toronto sandwich  - danforth and Koreatown. Huge disappointment. The two mini sandwiches were the equivalent to half a regular sandwich and cost $10.50 before tax. Ludacris!  Though i like the idea of the place, I doubt I would return for a grilled cheese. I might go one evening for a  Wine and Cheese tasting or to one of the events.. but an $11 sandwich for lunch that doesn't come with salad, it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Dear sweet Cheesus I have found heaven. With cheese grease on my fingers I write this review as a happy and cheese haze induced smile having patron. If you dig cheese you'll dig this place. I am beyond happy with my Huston sandwich choice and can't wait to come back for brunch and trivia. This place is the business in cheese and the owner Kevin is so welcoming and friendly. I will be a return customer for sure. Again and again and again."}
{"text":"Lets start off by saying I am OBSESSED with cheese. Cheese should be in everything! So I was super excited to find this place.  I tried the Beijing(12$) and thought it was just okay. The Chinese bbq pork was dry but overall, very creative idea.  I also had the Charleston(11$). How can you go wrong with brie and carmelized onions?! YUM.  Overall, it satisfied my craving for a nice grilled cheese. Would I come back? Probably not..I probably would just make it myself at home and save 11$ unless im super lazy.  You can use the Ritual app and get a 10$ credit using the code GINA8803. Love this app for the free credits...I can just go around and try things out without having to double check the blackhole that is my wallet *tear  Cheers! :)"}
{"text":"This is a solid three star establishment. The food was good, the selection interesting and the staff pleasant. Maybe you need to be a real cheese aficionado to appreciate what it is. Not memorable, just a decent place to grab a grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a sunny Sunday morning. We had a discounted voucher for the brunch and was overall pleasantly surprised by the 1) service, 2) food options, 3) food quality, 4) casual yet hip ambience and 5) board game options.   We ordered the morning breakfast option on Mac n' cheese and cinnamon vanilla French toast with a mimosa and Caesar to follow. And while waiting for our food, we squeezed in a game or two of four in a row, and over the duration of downing our food, a game of bananagrams.   I'm excited to come back for more ooey gooey cheesy goodness and some gouda trivia nights!"}
{"text":"Melted cheesetastic!  When someone sent me a link to the website for cheesewerks I was so excited!  I love grilled cheese...an amazing comfort food!   Grilled cheese with meaty goodness is even better and there are a fair few choices; including their regular menu, a brunch menu and the had added a few more 'cities' to their existing menu.  I opted for the houston with bacon; they are right you know, everything tastes better with bacon!  It was good! My only criticism is I prefer chunkier meat on the sandwich; grilled cheese is accompanied by pickles and potato chips.  Don't feel like the usual bread option then have it Mac and Cheese style; oh and gluten free bread is available.  Fancy something sweet...candy bar grilled cheese?!  I really need to have this while they still have creme eggs available!   The place is bright and clean and airy. Definitely has a good lunch/brunch feel to it.  Homemade soda's...pineapple and ginger; yum!   We made a reservation...it was not busy when we went...this place should be mobbed!  Also limited selection of board games available...nice touch!"}
{"text":"For a place that specializes in one thing, I expect a lot more than what is on offer at Cheesewerks.  I really find it hard to believe anyone can give this place more than three stars, these must be people with some tongue disease where bland things taste really good.  Honestly, we gave this place a couple of tries, because we really wanted to like it, but none of the sandwiches is anything to write home about.  They're dinky examples of what happens when more money is spent on Marketing than ensuring that the food is tasty.  Their sides are non-existent (olives...period...and not very good ones, either).  The soups, all three, are completely bland - it was like drinking moistened blenderized cardboard.  And our most scathing comments are reserved for the actual grilled cheese sandwiches - they're soooo small, devoid of adequate amounts of cheese and filling, and not even well prepared (each time we went, they were either soggy or burnt).  No word of a lie, every other restaurant in the area with Grilled Cheese on the menu, have better grilled cheese sandwiches than this place!  The counter staff is friendly-enough, but don't ask them too much about what they're serving because they don't really know.  There are two rays of hope here:  the house-made sodas - some of them are not bad (unfortunately, we had one that I think they forgot to add flavour to); and the ketchups which are generally really good (just not the red pepper - again, blandorama).  Really, can't wait till this place finally closes to make room for something better.  If you need to satisfy a grilled cheese craving, walk a few blocks northeast to the Leslieville Cheese Shop instead, or go home and make one yourself - it'll be cheaper and more satisfying."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and looked forward to checking this place out, as I love all things cheese. I walked all the way from my hotel on a Tuesday evening only to find that they were inexplicably closed when their website said they would be open till 9 that evening. No signs on the door or anything - just closed!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Fort York library and wanted to get lunch. The area is mainly condos and not a lot of choices. After a long time walking, we walked on bathurst, past front and this was the first food place that wasn't subways or dominos pizza lol. We decided to try it out since we were starving. 2pm on a Wednesday; we were the only ones there, but the atmosphere is great! Nice music, cohesive colour scheme, clean tables/ benches. The menu is also very well designed, and they have board games!! The place is like a mesh between Panera Bread and Snakes & Lattes, very cozy and great place to chat and hang out with friends.  Got the Charleston grilled cheese; pickles are like cucumbers, not sour, chips aren't salty, which is good. Sandwich came in 3 triangular slices, a little burnt but crispy. The Chicken Itza is warm and very filling (4 slices); comes with 2 little cold dips.  What I am particularly impressed with this place that makes me want to come again is the customer service. It has been a long time since I've been served over my standards and is the reason why i'm giving this place a 5 stars. When we entered, we were greeted by this friendly guy who asked if we came here before, when we said no, he was delighted to explain the menu to us. He gave us suggestions and personal favourites and informed us that we can switch around ingredients to our fancy. I like that he pays attention to the order too, he double checked if i wanted chips on the side because I had said i didn't want any as i was debating but changed my mind later, and when he asked for my name, he asked if it spells with a C or K. The spelling wouldn't matter, but it was nice to have cared about that. He was eager to help us and while we were eating, he asked if everything was okay and if we needed anything. Always smiling, and he deserved a big tip.  I love the fact that their trays are unconventional and their tip jar is unique and cute. Family-run business, 3 years running, I'd say open up another location! I'm definitely coming back in the winter to try their fondues!"}
{"text":"A great spot - lots of tasty food and a nice selection of wine. The staff are very friendly and the place is comfortable. I especially like the rustic tomato soup."}
{"text":"Really liked it and I plan on visiting again. It was my first time trying out cheese fondue and was a bit nervous to get the wine infused cheese fondue but was in for a delicious surprise. The variety of choice for food to dip into the cheese was great, the owner was incredibly friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"Love going to Cheesewerks . I've had the Beijing, New York, and the roasted red pepper soup.  As good as the sandwiches are , the soup really is unreal too - hand made.  It's a heavy sandwich so in moderation but it's legit. They also sell cheeses and put on events.  They also let me watch the leafs game once there (and you can even use the TV to play PS3 !)  highly recommended"}
{"text":"Im not saying that I'm prepared to drop $12 on a grilled cheese sandwich that often, but I had \"the Houston\" which was beef brisket and it was really good. My lunch mate ordered \"The Los Angeles\" and said it was the best grilled cheese he's ever had. However I have to stick with a 3 star review as the other times I've been there I don't even remember what I ordered since they were adequate but non-memorable lunch experiences. This place reminds me of Sky Blue Sky Sandwiches, but more expensive and less selection.    One thing that consistently does disappointment is their excuse for a pickle that comes with the little bowl of potato chips as a side dish. That is one flavourless piece of cucumber pretending to be a pickle.  Side note: Decent selection of craft beers available on site, but nothing on tap."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Lunch/Dinner Specialty: Artisan Grilled Cheese Menu items: Beijing, Charleston and Los Angeles grilled cheese  Cheese is probably one of the most feel-good, versatile, comfort foods. Anything you make with cheese enhances its flavour, tastes better and often changes the texture. When in its most decadent form - grilled - cheese goes through a transformation that I just can't get enough of.  So where do you find the best grilled cheese in Toronto? At Cheesewerks, a cheese emporium serving a creative selection of 100% Canadian artisan cheese products. Cheesy? maybe, but this is how their food makes me feel. Warm and fuzzy, as I indulge in my fave concoction, the Beijing. A sweet and juicy ooey-gooey melange of Asiago cheese, BBQ pork, hoisin sauce (commonly known as a Chinese dipping sauce) and green onion served on a house-made potato-onion bread.  When feeling even more cheesy, I default to the Charleston, my dessert grilled cheese. A brie cheese treat that just melts as you bite and explodes with sugary notes from the raisins in the bread, the caramelized onions and the apricot chutney. The sandwich is also tangy as the brie coats all sweet ingredients...one of those items you just gotta eat to experience.  And when I've monotonously visited my fave cities, then I head east for a change and hit the Los Angeles. Using avocado as the star of the dish, the Cheesewerks guys make a savory story out of this sandwich by adding good ol' havarti to the equation mixed with arugula and citrus compote sandwiched on sourdough bread. When in company, the best way to eat these is to mix and match. Half of this, half of that, et voilà!  Besides their traditional grilled cheese sandwiches, the \"big cheese\" continues to experience the art of grilling cheese by offering mac and cheese versions of the city-themed assortments, which put the word decadent in very bite, as well as fondue platters. How else they'll continue to transform their product? I can not wait to taste.  Parting thought: Though prices stand at $8-$10 per sandwich, the use of quality, local and specialty ingredients take this product out of the \"fast-food\" category and places it on the gourmet-artisan movement. So cheese yourself with these.  Buen Provecho, Viviana."}
{"text":"The menu looked so good, and I had to miss out on brunch with friends there the Sunday before I went, so I had been craving good mac n cheese for DAYS before I went.  Should have been a slam dunk for Cheesewerks! I got the Houston Mac n Cheese (minus the BBQ sauce... maybe that was the issue? or maybe not)  I like that they have board games, but I wouldn't call the chairs or decor particularly cozy or comfort inducing.  Got the mac n cheese to my car and took a bite.... needs salt. Ok add some salt.  still... meh. Anti-climactic is the word I believe"}
{"text":"Omgggg. Do I start at the iPad registers, the awesome owner or the delicious food? The board games? The decor/atmosphere? OMG JUST VISIT IT IT'S SMASHING.  Edit: second visit was disappointing. We waited outside for it to open, which it did late - the employee opening up was rude and didn't invite us to sit and wait inside. I dislike that it's counter-service payment with the expectation of tip (I tip for table service). I REALLY dislike that you can't tip less than 10% on the machine. The soup was terrible - burned my throat from the spices and they didn't offer any recompense on that front. Perhaps it's best to visit when the owner is there.   I'm also annoyed that you can't replace the big bowl of kettle chips with anything. I don't eat those and it is a waste."}
{"text":"It's a nice addition to the neighborhood in this area of Bathurst and Wellington because food selection is sparse south of King St on Bathurst.  The store offered free grilled cheese sandwiches for two hours, the lines were long but the service was fast.  To ensure the speedy service, no substitutions were allowed for the special.  Two dudes I presume are owners/managers seemed friendly (asian guy handing out sandwiches was pretty good).  The girls behind the counter weren't the same unfortunately.  Ok back to the sandwich, it was good but I found it to be really oily.  I wondered if they soaked the bread in oil before because it tasted like it was drenched in oil which really put me off.  I wasn't the only one who felt that it was excessively oily.  My grandmother thought it was garlic bread based on the sheer oil permeating from it.  I gave it 3 stars because they did a free promo which is nice.  Doubt I would return but maybe next time I'll ask to hold the butter.  Ketchup was $.80 I don't know if that's because the sandwiches or free or if that's what they usually charge."}
{"text":"Scrapes in with a 3 star rating.   Tried this place on Sunday. It's a fast food type of setting, with sit down restaurant prices and slow service.   General impression:  - understaffed.  Very slow service.  - confusing menu that needed lots of explanation.   - prices are high for hell the type of setting provided. For example, a fondue is $40. Toasted cheese with a few chips is $12.  - you can't help yourself to utensils. You need to ask at the counter for everything. With one guy doing everything, this is a slow process.  - food: was nice, but nothing amazing. Most items tasty, but the menu lacked some basic things...... Like a cheese tray. This is a cheese restaurant, I would image they offer a cheese try?!  Over this place has potential, but is very poorly executed. I drove down from the burbs to try. I don't think it was worth the effort."}
{"text":"The mac and cheese here is good. I ordered the picton and it was savoury, almost to the point of being too much, but very creamy and succulent. I like the noodles they use for the pasta. However, the nachos are subpar. I ordered the beef brisket nachos and they were soggy and burnt, to the point where parts were entirely black. I expect much better than this."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore Cheesewerks. In a nutshell, here are some of its highlights:  -Family owned and operated; the staff here are always happy, sweet, friendly, and accommodating -Awesome trivia nights. Cool prizes (even for non-winners), a great mix of categories (from general random knowledge, to guessing that song/artist, to watching videos and frantically writing a million things down to spew back random facts, to cookie stacking!) -Fondue Fridays. While they have yummy fondues most days, there are a wider variety available on Fridays (and comes with a nice spread of different goodies to dip into).  -Board games! Yep, they have a selection of board games you can break out while enjoying your cheesy treats -The Mac and Cheese ROCKS. It is perfect comfort food (especially in the chilly winter). It is ooey gooey cheesy amazingness. -Candy Bar Grilled Cheese. It may sound weird, but try it, you won't regret it. It's pretty much a candy bar of your choice (you get to pick from a giant jar), with some mascarpone, served with syrup and fruit. It. Rocks. -They have lots of deals going on - follow them on twitter & facebook to keep posted -BRUNCH! They have an awesome brunch menu that is ever-changing -Free parking! Something that is rare and awesome in this area   Check Cheesewerks out next time you're in the area. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"If this place was on a high pedestrian traffic street, it would be packed all the time!!  My most recent visit was a Saturday evening at around 7:30pm.  There were two other couples dining in this modern spacious semi self-served joint.  The two of us were greeted at the counter where the menu is above on the back wall.    The Beijing sammy is awesome, but I love to browse around just to see what else is offered before making my final decision.  As I did, I noticed they had a little sign saying they order their bread from St. John's Bakery (a little bakery around the corner from my house that does a LOT for the community).  Immediately, I brought this up to the friendly lady behind the counter and started a little chat.  Cheesewerks's rating just went up a star!  They also sell goods to take home such as cheeses, cheese boards, jams etc.  After much debating and a little wine tasting (yep, wine), we finally ordered and sat at a table right BESIDE THE GAMES!!  I was so excited to see them have board games such as Jenga, Monopoly, and Foodie Fight!  We played as we waited for our food to be served:  The Beijing: (4/5 stars) BBQ pork with hoisin and asiago cheese.  A taste of familiarity of the Chinese char siu, which I love.  Grilled with cheese (another love), there's nothing to complain about.  The Houston: (3/5 stars) Braised beef brisket with jalapeno jack cheese, and house-made BBQ sauce, on sourdough.  The beef, cheese, and even bread itself was good.  However, I personally found the bbq sauce was a little bit too sweet for me.    The LA Mac n Cheese: (3/5 stars) Their mac n cheese was supposed to start featuring the following day, but i did not know and ordered it since it was already on the menu.  The lady originally said it was only for the next day, but decided to make an exception to serve it to me.  How nice!  It came topped with avacado, arugula, and a citrus compote, which worked surprisingly well.  It was good, but nothing spectacular that I haven't had before.  Cider and Wine: (4/5 stars) YESS!! They have booze!!  For a good price too!!  They don't have an exhaustive list, but pretty decent and thorough.  Service: (5/5 stars) Although its semi self-served, the lady was very friendly.    **I usually list all the prices in my reviews, but I have no recollection of this time at all.  But I DO remember that all this with booze, tax, and tip, came up to around forty-something bucks...  This place lacks a little bit in atmosphere.  Again, the location hurts a little.  Nonetheless, the service and food makes up for some of it.  I really want to say I loved their grilled cheese, but after having grilled cheese from the NYC's grilled cheese truck (6/5 stars), this just does not compare.  But I am NOT complaining about grilled cheese sandwiches, good service, board games, and beer! Definitely revisiting!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food & fun night out! Grilled cheese & tomato soup was to die for. The fondue was the perfect size portions & very tasty! Mac & cheese with chicken that was very tender then the desert (chocolate bar grilled cheese with mascapone) was the perfect ending! Only draw back for us was the acoustics, really loud. They need some sound buffers. Service was good, just enough time between courses to make you really ready for the next one."}
{"text":"I will NOT go back even though I rate it 4 stars.   I must say the sandwich was excellent, each sandwich has it's own unique flavor. But it is too-too pricey for just sandwich and cheese. I also don't like the sides they provide, chips and 2 sliced of cucumbers. Really??!! Come on! A big bag of chips cost $1.5 at walmart, and cucumber is like $1 each?? The owner truly knows how to milk the customers!"}
{"text":"Visited this 2 times - once to buy cheese and another time for lunch.  Cheese - I bought a block of cheese as a gift so I didn't get to enjoy it too much. There isn't too much selection (less than 10), but the staff seemed knowledgeable about cheese and will let you try before tasting. I picked up a gouda cheese, and the sample was quite nice.  Lunch - Shared 2 grilled cheese sandwiches (Los Angeles and a Original), rustic tomato soup, and sweet tea. The sandwiches also came with chips. Everything was very good. I thought I would like the Los Angeleas a lot since I thought I would enjoy the avocado, but it turned out to be the thing I liked the least. The chutney was sweet and oily, and I wasn't too crazy about it. I actually liked the Original more. I really liked the soup and sweet tea.   The space itself was very spacious, open and clean. It's self-serve, where you order at the counter and pick it up when it's ready. They have games on hand so it's a good place to hang out.   All in all, this was a welcome addition to the neighborhood. They also sell bread from a local bakery, which is useful and a good complement to the cheese they sell."}
{"text":"I can't think of many places that do cheese fondue so it makes for a unique experience.  Their cheese fondue has either wine or beer in it, making the taste interestingly complex.  Stay away from the kettle-chips, they taste like regular chips that are warmed up.  They also serve an assortment of beers.    Cheesewerks has a casual and clean atmosphere, not unlike the Ikea cafeterias.  Speaking of which, they use the Ikea bowls to serve some of their food in.  You go up to order, and when your order is ready they call out your name and you grab your tray of food.  It's simple and it works, although I wouldn't go here for a romantic date.  The two times that I've gone to Cheesewerks have been to participate in their food trivia nights.  It's a family-run business and the owner is a hardcore nerd when it comes to trivia.  His enthusiasm is great and the trivia night is always well organized.  There is always a food theme, and he keeps it interesting by changing up the question or challenge structure.  A forewarning that the questions are really difficult and browsing for answers is not allowed!  There is a fee for the trivia and the prizes are half of the collected fees and some bonus stuff."}
{"text":"We literally just walked in the door after visiting Cheesewerks for the first time. Here is my review.  I recently read a discussion on the Cheesewrks website on the appeal of Groupon-type deal offers and whether they work. I want to say that we used an online voucher for this visit and we had not heard of Cheesewerks before, so the voucher certainly worked to expose us to the restaurant and get us in the door. Verdict? WE LOVED IT!!!  The voucher most definitely worked in not only getting us in but we will definitely be back and spread some valuable word of mouth!!  Now the food. We were there for brunch and ordered the cheddar, apple and sausage stuffed french toast, and the Beijing stuffed french toast (see online menu for the fillings). They were so cheesy, so tasty, so jam packed with ooey gooey goodness I think I commented on every bite!!! The biggest compliment I can give is this: The Cheddar, Apple and Sausage came with real maple syrup for dipping. Maple syrup is one of my major weaknesses, I put it on everything!!! I actually found myself opting not to dip some of my fork-fulls just to not obstruct the flavour and cheesiness of the french toast itself.  The fruit accompaniment was fresh and delicious and the french press coffee was wonderful.   The atmosphere was fun, friendly, and there was a class learning how to make caesars. They have board games for playing, and fun sounding trivia nights posted on their calendar. We cant wait to go back to use the second part of Our voucher (it was good for brunch AND lunch/dinner) and perhaps taking part in a trivia night.   If you love cheese, you have to check this place out. Just walk in the front door and the smells of the cheeses will pull you in further!!   Thanks for the great experience Cheesewerks, see you soon!!!"}
{"text":"Casual place. Its a quirky kinda place. Good for a quick dinner. You pick the flavor and then you pick whether it is a grilled cheese, mac and cheese, nachos, etc.   Got the Los Angeles sandwich and the Charleston Mac and Cheese. The Los Angeles sandwich was really good. The Charleston was not good at all. It was pretty disgusting and the pasta was pretty bare. I was expecting a very gooey and rich mac and cheese. But this was not it.   Service was slow, but they were nice. Theres probably a reason why they have board games available...   Would come back for the grilled cheese, but not the mac and cheese."}
{"text":"After mixed reviews from friends I thought I would give it a go. I was craving mac and cheese - must be the fact that it was -10 degrees outside.  There was a mix up with my order and quite a few more orders in before mine. Once everything was sorted, about 20 minutes in, I received the Houston Mac & Cheese. It's a really big portion. Not the conventional mac and cheese I was expecting but still tasty.  The people working were very friendly and apologised as they were having some difficulty with their machines.  Overall, the experience wasn't what I expected. Maybe one day I'll try the grilled sandwiches. Or, I will go across the street to the Thompson diner for their mac and cheese (something to try). 3 stars for the friendly service"}
{"text":"Nothing beats a drizzly Saturday afternoon than a grilled cheese sammie. I was craving the Los Angeles so I headed down since I hadn't been since its inception two months ago.   It was gooey and ooey and hit every sweet and sour spot. Yumo!  Another surprise: their drinks. Their daughter was helping out at the cash register (super cute) and she said the tangerine pineapple drink was her favourite. So that's what I got! The flavours really do work well together.   The service always comes with a smile.   Cheesewerks also puts on some fantastic events. They did a fondue session for Valentine's Day and they have \"meet the maker\" events where you can be educated on different cheeses and the process of where it comes from. I'm excited to see this establishment grow and continue.   Kudos!"}
{"text":"Looking for a good sandwich with cheese, this is the spot.  If you are a pork lover the Beijing and Miami are your choices.  Bread is well done (and not over done). Meat is tender and well marinated. Buffalo is also a classic option (chicken). Now I will start the review, the Mac and cheese is the shieeeettt (which means it's good). You remember that Mac n cheese that mom use to make, where she used 2 packs of the Kraft cheese powder and added butter to make it cheesy, well this is 10 times better.   Friendly service and craft beer this is a great spot for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Sitting in Cheesewerks as I write this. My strawberry shortcake soda is really overly sweet. Tried to explain that it tastes off to the guy behind the counter, but no customer service. Too bad. I wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"I could've sworn I wrote a review for this place. I totally remember writing one and it's gone. Failure of memory or of Yelp, who knows?  The first time I went it was horrible. The portions were tiny, price high and service non existent. The second time much was the same but the portions got bigger. I wish they had a smaller size for everything for those who aren't big eaters (of which I am but that was a lot of food!).  I like that they have board games about, we played a card game while we waited for our food. The wait was weirdly long considering it was just a grilled cheese and a mac and cheese. There were other orders for a small group and they came out in steps, instead of all together. Very strange service for a restaurant.  I think the price is way too high for a single comfort food meal with no drinks, side or dessert. We paid about ~$40 for two entrees. That's nuts, no matter how filling."}
{"text":"My friend and I were both SO SO SO excited for our cheese feast, but our visit to Cheesewerks definitely fell short. Womp womp.  My dining partner has been here before and she had nothing but great things to say about the food and the owners. But on this stormy Wednesday night the owners were no where to be seen, which it turns out was super sad for us.   The dude at the counter was a bit of a Negative Nelly, and kinda rude (we all have bad days, I get it, but this was crappy). We tried to order the fondue and the cheese plate and were instead met with his thorough discouragement because it was too much food. We told him we were ready and excited for ALL THE CHEESE and he still tried to persuade us not to go for it.   The cheese plate, as it turns out, is only available when the owners are there. Which is a huge shame, and also weird. I mean if Via Rail can pull together a cheese plate, you'd think a cheese restaurant could. So we ending up ordering a grilled cheese sandwich to share along with the fondue, a beer and a cider.  The fondue comes with bread, sausage, potatoes, apples and a selection of vegetables. When I asked what the veggies would be he could not tell me specifically which ones would be coming with our fondue, because he had no idea. Annoying, and weird since the kitchen is literally behind him, through a window...  Anyhoo, the grilled cheese we ordered - the Charleston - was delicious!   While we waited for our fondue we set up a game of scrabble (we took up two tables, but were only two people, lots of room). When the fondue came Negative Nelly was a bit stressed about making room on the table, and ended up shoving my friend off her seat and knocking over all her scrabble letters on to the floor. No apologies.  The fondue itself was inedible, it was like someone dropped a bag of salt into it. The mystery veggies turned out to be snow peas and yellow peppers (not my first choice) and there were no apples at all. We asked about the apples and said it would have been nice to know beforehand that they were out he said \"I would have liked to know too\".  Not ones to return food, we actually asked for a refund for our inedible fondue and were initially refused. But we stayed firm with our request, and eventually he managed to get in contact with the owners and gives us the cash back for the price of the fondue.  Somehow even with our fondue refund it cost us $40 for one grilled cheese sandwich, a cider, and a beer. Which was definitely too pricey for what we got.  It's a huge shame because we were both SUPER excited to eat ALL THE CHEESE. We ended up at a restaurant elsewhere eating several cheese plates, however. Mmmm cheese.  TLDR: Customer service was really crappy, but improved just as we were leaving (too little too late). Some food was good, some food was terrible, but kinda expensive either way."}
{"text":"Cheese making course is lots of fun.  You make ricotta, paneer and fig jam.   Sip a little wine or craft beer.  Learn about some of the cheese makers in the province.  Fun times.  P.S. I got this as course a gift, and I don't know what the cost is, so I cannot comment if it's worth the price."}
{"text":"Aside from my home made grilled cheese this is the best damn grilled cheese I've ever had in my life!  I decided I will also steal the sriracha ketchup recipe for my own home recipe. Boo ya. Being totally honest, the only thing I would say that sandwiches should be bigger!"}
{"text":"service and foods five stars! try their cheese foudue and it is absolutely over what i had expect. If u come to this place, try the chesse foundue without alcohol. so perfect"}
{"text":"I used to be a loyal customer, but in the past few months it seems they've changed their buffalo recipe. Very disappointing as it no longer seems to have any buffalo sauce, and   is now more so just mac and cheese with chicken. Gone are the days of saucey buffalo and with that so goes my loyalty. Adieu."}
{"text":"I'm a good Dutch girl - cheese is a food group to me. That also means that I'm a bit picky and... well, I won't go so far as to say \"hard to please,\" but I don't impress that easily.  I've been to Cheesewerks twice now, once for a grilled cheese that was spectacular, and yesterday for a to-die-for fondue.  My first visit included a guest with Crohn's and a guest with Celiac. You wouldn't expect a restaurant, especially one that specializes in things like sandwiches and mac & cheese, to roll with those limitations, but Tom (one of the owners) didn't even blink. He knows his menu and he knows his stuff and was able to recommend around the dietary issues without the slightest hesitation.  If you want a highlight, ask Tom to tell you about their Grilled Cheese Chocolate. His eyes light up as he describes the sinfully decadent dessert (made with a full-size chocolate bar and slices of cocoa bread, grilled and served with maple syrup for dipping!). It's absolutely adorable to watch. :)   Over two visits, four guests and I have tried grilled cheese, fondue, quesadillas and nachos. So far we haven't encountered one that didn't make us want to return, quickly. Haven't dared the dessert yet, but judging by the salivating by one of my guests when she heard about it on our way out, we'll be back and yeah, we'll be trying that one.  Other memorable moments:   - The house-made soda - yesterday's magic was a flavourful Apple Pie that made my friend's eyelids flutter. - The selection of craft beers - one of my guests is a craft beer fan and was quite pleased to find yumminess he hadn't tasted before. Not a huge beer drinker myself but he was definitely impressed with their selection."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place after a friend suggested it, but it didn't live ip to my expectations.  I got the Brooklyn Mac n Cheese and it was really creamy and cheesey. Not like a \"mmmm I can eat this for days\" creamy and cheesey, more like a \"this is too much... I think I'm going to explode\". I knew it had ricotta in it, but I felt like I was eating a tub of ricotta. My friend had the original and it was soooo much better, not too creamy and it has the classic cheddar taste.   We also wanted to try the fondue... until we saw the proce. $40 for fondue? Are you kidding me? That's more than a steak at the Keg. No thanks, I'll make my own fondue at home.  I don't know. I mean I love cheese and I love the idea of this restaurant, but I don't love it itself."}
{"text":"Well this place is just pretty darn good isn't it?  Yes this place sells grilled cheese sandwiches, but it's all about the cheese here, not the sandwich. They sell all things cheese. You can buy hunks of it, fondue sets, crackers to go with your hunks, and all sorts of other accessories and sides.  I went with the Los Angeles because you could almost sell me anything if it has avocado on it. Aside from the avocado the sandwich is loaded with havarti, arugula, and a citrus compote. I went on Saturday around noon so when I placed my sandwich order they asked if I wanted a fried egg on it. I quickly found out that this was part of their brunch offering. Well they were offering, so why not! I completed my meal with their garlic and red pepper dip and an Amsterdam 416 beer.  When my name was called I was presented with a silver platter (ok, it was stainless steel) with my sandwich and sides. The brunch special came with a side of potato chips. I'm not sure if you get a choice but my meal came with dill pickle flavour.   Now I'm a traditionalist when it comes to my grilled cheese and I NEVER dip mine in ketchup. But since I got sold on the dips I gave it a try. The dip was flavourful and the red peppers were easily the hero, but the garlic was non-existent. While I enjoyed slathering on the dip I think the next time I'll just skip it and eat the sandwich in all it's cheese-y glory. The citrus compote provided a nice bite but didn't overpower and I think the arugula's bitterness helped to cut it as well.  The service was excellent. When I finished my meal I wasn't sure what to do with the tray so I brought it up to the counter. The woman asked me by name what I thought of the meal and thanked me for coming in.  Sandwiches here will run you from $7.50 for the original, up to $9.50 for the Toronto. Considering the ingredients you get between the slices it's a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"I went in to Cheesewerks today with a friend to test out the Nachos for Superbowl Sunday.  Instead of our football jerseys, we brought in our Scrabble board.  My friend and I both have been in before to try the Sandwiches. My friend tried the Beijing (Asiago/Grilled Pork/Hoisin/Green Onion) and I had the Toronto (I picked the Little Italy and The Danforth versions).  We both enjoyed the sandwiches ... and although they are priced at the top end of the \"grilled cheese\" spectrum, the quality ingredients are second to none.  Back to today's menu:  We had the Cheesy Gourmet Nachos. What I loved most about this was the sprinkling of Fresh Cilantro over everything. It gave the typical, heavy Nachos a light and fresh flavour.  The tortilla chips were crisp and light. The slivers of jalapeño were paper thin. The olives were actual smashed Kalamata olives, not the sliced, ring olives you get everywhere else.  On the side, there was sour cream, salsa verde and fresh-made guacamole!  I also ordered the soup special, which was a red pepper and cheese soup. Super-delicious!   I had the King Brewery Dark and my buddy had a house-made soda.  The whole thing was less than $30 ... and we spent a good while there.    The staff were kind enough to pull out another game (Jenga) for us to try (since they saw us with our nerdy Scrabble board).  Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I have been to Cheesewerks, and thankfully my experience is still good and in fact improved since my last visit. Service is still great and very friendly. Cheesewerks has improved their portion size and menu value which I had a minor criticism about. There are a lot more menu options, all looked really good. I had the Charleston grilled cheese which had brie, caramelized onions and apricot chutney which was really good with a good mix of savory and sweet. The generous side of kettle chips which I think is homemade, makes for a very satisfying meal. I highly suggest eating in the restaurant rather than take out, as the grilled cheese sandwich in the box will become more of a cheesy soggy mess (but still tasting good) by the time you take it back home or to the office. Cheesewerks also hosts a lot of events throughout the month, including a foodie trivia night which sounds really fun and something I want to try."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong.. It was good.. It came with a side of chips and some pickle spears.. But I was expecting a lot considering I paid $12.. I got the Houston grilled cheese which has jalapeño jack cheese, beef brisket and BBQ sauce.. The bread was super good but thin.. The cheese was good but they didn't put a lot.. The beef brisket was amazing and tender but only if you could find it.. I honestly forgot that it had beef until I bit into a piece after my 3rd bite.. I got the BBQ sauce on the side which I highly recommend.. It was really really good but I think if they put it on the grilled cheese it would have been too overpowering.. If I paid $8 - $10 for this meal, after taxes, I would have been really happy.. The only way I'd pay $12 is if they had more cheese or beef.. I'll give this place another try with their Mac and cheese"}
{"text":"A while back, I bought a Buytopia voucher for $45 (valued at $96) for a 4-course dinner for 2 at Cheesewerks. I always seem to redeem my voucher at the last possible moment, so I'm grateful that Cheesewerks extended the expiry date. The deal also included two glasses of house wine.   The first course was Cheesewerks' original grilled cheese with a blend of aged and double-smoked cheddars grilled on locally baked sourdough. It was paired with a rustic herb tomato soup- oven roasted tomatoes, garlic and thyme infused with organic vegetable broth. The soup was good for dipping, but I didn't enjoy it much on its own. It was a little reminiscent of pizza sauce. But the grilled cheese itself was fantastic and probably my favourite thing of the entire meal!  Second course- fondue with Canadian Swiss, Pinot Grigio, roasted garlic and nutmeg. It was served with artisan bread, roasted fingerling potatoes, green apples and pickled onions. I thought that the cheese was very tasty, but there was way too much for the two of us. The apples made a good palate cleanser in between bites of cheesy goodness.   The third course was the Charleston Mac and Cheese with double-cream brie, oven-caramelized onions, apricot chutney, and topped with Artisan Bread Crunch. Personally, I'm not a big fan of brie cheese, so fortunately it wasn't too strong here. The mac and cheese was surprisingly not too heavy, but I thought it could be more flavourful. In the end, I was way too full from the fondue course and had to pack most of this home to save room for dessert.   The fourth and final course was a dessert grilled cheese with melted mascarpone, coffee crisp, fresh strawberries and maple syrup. As simple as it was, the combination was delicious! I felt an urge to buy some coffee crisps and mascarpone and attempt this at home.   As much as I love cheese, I was practically in a coma by the end of the meal from the overdose of cheese. That said, I would come back next time just for the grilled cheese!"}
{"text":"Say Cheese...werks! Wow. What a cheesy way to start a review. Not my best.  Moving right along.   This place has free wifi, Fondu Fridays, and they serve wine and beer. Most importantly they serve everything cheese related in the world from the grilled sandwiches to 6 different kinds of mac and cheese and varying cheese specials.   It has a cozy sit-as-long-as-you-want atmosphere, and really saved my life one day as I slowly walked in the rain from the island airport in search of the internet. Holy hell I love the internet and cheese.   PEPPER PREPARATION: There are two seatings for Fondu Fridays, and reservations are highly recommended."}
