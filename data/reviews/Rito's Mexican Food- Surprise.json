{"text":"Nice family owned place, with really good food.

 I loved their green chili burrito enchilada style with green sauce. Also, there beans were delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food! Everything is delicious but their refried beans are like nothing you've ever tasted before, truly outstanding! Try a bean burrito or an order of refried beans with tortillas to dip in the beans, you'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Yum yumm..when I saw this in surprise I was really happy, because driving all the way downtown to get a burro was to far!! Now it's right down the street. The burros are great and the service was spot on"}
{"text":"I have heard and read many good things about Rito's, so finally tried the Surprise location last Saturday.  Sorry but I just don't see what many others are raving about.  The place was half full but it took all customers about 30 minutes to be served.  That seems silly as all the filling is pre-prepared.  The green chili burrito filling was very good but minimal in size, mostly a large tortilla with very little filling.  It is expensive - Burrito with rice and beans and a soda was over $11.  The re-fried beans were excellent.  Some comment on the huge portions.  perhaps that is at the other locations.  I think Chipotle is much better, healthier and less expensive."}
{"text":"The owner is very friendly and attentive. The food is good. Some items seem overpriced. Also, charging for salsa is as irritating as a hamburger joint charging for ketchup when you order fries."}
{"text":"Outstanding Mexican food. Limited menu, but who cares it's delicious! We live about 20 minutes away and we don't mind the drive, the food is that good. Try the shredded beef tacos with guacamole, they're AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Homemade and delicious flavors. Known for takeout service so limited tables and all beverages served in cans or bottles. Great service and real pride in their food which is reflected in the quality. Will definitely become a \"favorite\""}
{"text":"Love the tacos and green chili and the taco salad !! Love the owners !! Nice family owned place with good food !! Just wish they had combo plates for customers on lunch break:)"}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good! Eat the beef tacos, and get the Guac with them. :)"}
{"text":"Best burrito in Surprise hands down! The green chili is the best I've ever had, always a pleasure going to eat at Rito's Surprise."}
{"text":"Very clean place. Friendly owners that seem to know everyone by first name and their order. Food is excellent! We only regret not trying this place before today. This is not a fast food establishment and seating is limited however take out is an option and well worth it! I would highly recommend this place especially the green chili burrito and must try the rice and beans! Hands down the best we have tasted in Az.!"}
{"text":"I think the prices are too high for what you get.  Two people having two tacos, two green chili enchiladas and two bottled waters for $18.00?  No beans, no rice just a little (very little) lettuce no chips and salsa.  The flavor was very good but, come on, you can have a heck of a lunch for $18.00 most anywhere and they'll give you free water.  We would have had iced tea but it was bottled also.   I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Tried Rito's for the first time last week (thank you Yelp) and was very pleased. The food was excellent, the place was very clean, and the service was outstanding. I had the red chili burrito enchilada style and loved every bite. There isn't a lot of flash (no secret ingredients or unique options) but the quality is very high and the prices are reasonable for the amount of food that you get. 

I should also mention that they use certified Angus beef, which is pretty impressive for a small burrito shop in Surprise! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Best freshest Mexican food in surprise and I've tried them all I've eaten at all the ritos in town 51 ave 14th st  it's nice to have one this far west great tacos and enchiladas rice and beans"}
{"text":"I thought I would try this Mexican food place on April Fools Day.  We had an enchilada taco and nachos.  Oh my gosh, all the chain Mexican restaurants need to go  back to school because Rito's has them beat.  All hail the new king of Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Rito's in Surprise and I can't say enough good things about the place.  We both had the green chili burrito with green sauce and it was delicious.  This is authentic Mexican food.  The burrito was huge.  The tortilla was fresh (no hard spots from a microwave) and it was filled with tender beef and lots of creamy green chili sauce.  Then it was totally covered with cheese (not just a little sprinkle) and a huge portion of the creamy green chili sauce.   We had a side of beans and we were fighting over them because they were so good.  This is GOOD food!  Can't wait to go back and try the enchiladas."}
{"text":"I am just coming down from my taco and refried beans high and can tell you how much I loved this place! A coworker took us here earlier in the week and I have been jonesing to go back all week with my kiddo. The beans. So delicious, creamy, rich, perfect. I haven't had refried beans this good since I moved here from CA. My kiddo said they were as good as Mario's (in Huntington Beach, CA - his all time favorite-) so this was high praise indeed! We also loved the salsa/hot sauce, again reminiscent of our CA fave, slightly different but close. The tacos were chock-full of shredded beef and fried then cheese and lettuce are piled in. Rich, flavorful, fresh and crunchy. Awesome homemade goodness! 

I love that this is a family business. Yes, the hours are limited, but it is really a take out place, not a full service restaurant. Closing shop by 6, and being closed on Sunday and Monday is something I can respect. It gives them a family life and a weekend. And happy people make happy food that makes their customers happy. We were helped by the owner who could not have been kinder. This will be a place that we will continue to patronize!"}
{"text":"Ritos is great traditional Mexican food. You know what I'm talking about if you grew up here. Great ordering system all on line. Ready when you get there. I will be back- often!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Great fresh food made when you order it.  This place is Not like the other Mexican food places. Unique.  Great chimi.  Will be back."}
{"text":"This place is great. Great food, small menu, nothing fussy, and the owners are fantastic. If I were local, I would eat here regularly. And get fat. But I'd be fat and happy. 

One caveat: it's very small, so if you're feeding a group I would advise take out, which they're happy to arrange."}
{"text":"I love their burritos there they are so delicious I wish they would open late. I eat there at least once a week. Everything on the menu is great and the people there are very nice. I would highly recommend it for anybody to try it. The food to little bit spicy but that's the way I like it."}
{"text":"Great family run place.  The friendly owners took their time explaining the menu and let us sample before we ordered.  It is a very unique counter type restaurant with a smallish seating area that seems to be setup for takeout.  But make no mistake, this is not fast food.  

I ordered the green chile burrito enchilada style with chips and guacamole.  My folks had an order of tacos, red chili burrito, and a green chili burrito.  The owners also gave us a side of rice to sample.  All items where hot and very fresh.  The ingredients were high quality and extremely well made.  It's pretty easy to see that Rito's is a labor of love for this family.  

Please also note that this is one of the cleanest restaurants I've set foot in.  You can see into the kitchen and it is literally spotless.  

I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"We live in the east side but we're in Surprise on business and went to Yelp for Mexican food. The first review said the green chili burro was great. Enough said. When we pulled up, we were a little skeptical. Mainly take out with limited seating.  But, we decided if there was seating available we would give it a try. There was and we did. We are glad we did.  The green chili burro was indeed delicious, just spicy enough. The refried beans were so so. Prices are a little high. I would come back for the burro."}
{"text":"I have to say that this  is the  best green chili burrito  that I've had since I was  a little  girl.. the enchilada sauce is the  best  when u find great rice and enchilada sauce you know you found the right  place  being mexican and  all"}
{"text":"My mouth is watering looking at the pictures because I know what I'm missing!! The first time I strolled into this place, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. The owner, Ritchie, asked my name and made small talk while I looked over the menu. I asked what he recommended and he said most people enjoy the green chile. He offered a sample and thus began my trip into flavor. It was magical. I'd been searching for a green chile that wasn't that unpalatable, dark green baby poo you get at \"oneofthoseberto's\". It was spicy, it was flavorful, and not overly salty. It was heaven. 

I went back the next day and guess what? He remembered my name and greeted me with it as I walked in. Over the next four or so months, I was in there at least twice a week, always greeted by name. I've taken my whole family to try this and they are all addicted. I've had just about everything on the menu, and would do it all again. If only I could. My work schedule changed, and now I share my days off with Ritchie. Sunday and Monday. They are closed on my Only Days Off!!! It's not a complaint against Rito's. It's a complaint against working for the MAN!! Seriously considering a career change to again align my diet with this green chile. Or red chile, (which, I'll have you know, I've witnessed Helen, Ritchie's wife preparing the peppers she dries herself!!) With or without beans. And the rice. Dang it, there goes the water works again. Oh stop making fun, I'm not crying, my tastebuds are!! I miss you Rito's!! Nothing compares. Believe the hype!!!"}
{"text":"The Green Chili Burrito rocks and is a must try... Those of you that have driven by wondering what the food is like... Once you stop in and try it you will be a regular..."}
{"text":"What a little treasure in Surprise!  Came in for the first time and ordered the beef tacos with guacamole and also beef enchilladas with a side of rice.  This is run by a very nice and hard working family.  You can tell as we were greeted warmly as we came in.  The menu is not huge at all, but the flavor of the food sure is!  The tortilla was deep fried and the taco was loaded with very flavorful beef.  The enchilladas had a very tasty red sauce with just about the right kick.  You can order the food by the item and have the option to purchase a side of beans or rice or both.  Prices are good with the portions you get and the quality of food.  This place beats all the chain restaurants because the home prepared style can only come from a Mom and Pop owned business.  Nothing fancy, but simple restaurant with very tasty quality food.  Their hours are limited but very worth coming in to dine in or take out.  Make this place your \"Go To\" place for lunch...you will not be disappointed.  Sure glad they chose to open in Surprise!"}
{"text":"What a great place to eat.  Friendly service, Freshly  made and oh so tasty.  I suggest you give it a try.  You won't be disappointed.  Nothing is so spicy hot you can't taste the flavor of the food.  No chicken dishes available.  I hope that the owners will add chicken dishes soon. However you will find the beef to be tender and flavorful."}
{"text":"The food here was great, good flavor and quality. The service was even better ! The owner was patient with us being that it was our first time, was very friendly. We will def come back here again!!"}
{"text":"Thought we would try this place as it had very good reviews on Yelp and it's in our neighborhood. I ordered the food to go. One Taco Salad with guacamole & sour cream on the side. It came as ordered but there was absolutely no meat at all in the salad so it was only beans, lettuce & cheese? Also ordered a taco that was OK. Also had a red chili burrito that was not what I expected, very little meat, no beans and very soupy. If that's how it's supposed to be shame on me. When I ordered the owner was super nice and repeated the order back to me so I was very disappointed when I arrived home and the salad had no beef in it. Listen, mistakes are made and they can be fixed. Give um a try, maybe you will have better luck than we did."}
{"text":"Food is definitely fresh and tasty, however they need to have a better system for Togo orders. They gave my order to someone else and let me sit there for 20 minutes before I asked what is taking so long. Before they figured it out, the lady looked me in the eyes and said she gave it to me already.

Kind of expensive. For the prices, they should put some tomatoes or a dollop of sour cream in their enchilada style burro plates.

I'll go back and try a taco salad."}
{"text":"This is the best place in town to go for a green chili burro. The service is always top notch and the owner always says hello by saying my name. It's a nice touch. The rice and beans are also excellent. Not a big menu, but that's OK because I'd rather a restaurant did a few things well,than a bunch of stuff mediocre. Try the green burro, you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This is The Spot when you're craving authentic homestyle Mexican food and great hospitality! 

Simple yet flavor filled menu!  Loved Rito's beef Red Chile burrito, enchilada style! Might be the best red Chile on the Westside! Meet was tender and succulent. Refried beans were creamy and delish! Guacamole, chips and salsa were too salty for me, but still good!  This is my spot when I'm this deep on the Westside!"}
{"text":"Sooo soo yummy. Friendly staff who actually takes pride in their business & genuinely cares about their customers. I love supporting family owned places like these- they are usually more delicious than a chain restaurant because of their own homemade recipes. 

I'm addicted to the bean and rice burrito enchilada style with green sauce. Can't get enough of it. Highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Called and got horrible service from whoever took my order. I felt rushed and was talked to as if I was doing them a favor. Was so offended that I'll never eat there or recommend there food to anyone. Also food is not great just to mention"}
{"text":"This was our first time and definitely won't be our last. We had the green chili beef burritos enchilada style and beef tacos and throughly enjoyed both. Loved the sauce on the burrito, you can tell everything is homemade. The owner was very friendly and welcoming. A small place with great tasting food!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and friendly service.  Seating is limited but they offer to go service."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Mexican food in Surprise! I love it so much I usually eat here about twice a week. You won't find better Mexican food in the area. I love the beef tacos and my new fav is the rice & bean burrito enchilada style. There hours are short and they close early so you'll need to plan ahead for dinner. However, if you live in Surprise and haven't tried Ritos yet you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I've had in forever. Closest ever to grandma's cooking. Not only is the food amazing but the owners and staff are equally amazing friendly and remember most people by name."}
{"text":"Really good food..a little on the pricey side and no fountain soda, but overall authentic."}
{"text":"Love Love this place GREAT Food I had the Green Chili Burro Enchiliada the best. I meet the owners wonderful people. Must go you will love it...I will  be back!!"}
{"text":"This is the best red and green chile sauce I've had since I lived in New Mexico. The red is earthy and the green is sweet with a mild heat--pour either one over a delicious beef burrito and I'm home again. The burritos are huge--I ended up taking half home and it was enough for another meal. Pro tip: top leftovers with an over medium egg (you can thank me later). The restaurant is exceptionally clean and cozy and the owner is very attentive. It's a family favorite."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place 5 stars is because I can't give it 6. I tried Rito's today for the first time and I am extremely impressed.  I got a chimichanga with a side of rice and beans. The beans are hands down the best restaurant refried beans I've ever had. The rice was nice and flavorful and the chimichanga....oh the chimichanga...so delicious that I couldn't stop eating it even when my tummy said no more please. Luckily I live a bit of a distance away from this place or else I'd spend way too much money here. The prices are a little steep to me, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Food was ridiculously good. I gave myself a belly ache from eating so much. Green burrito was phenomenal,  red was delicious.  I even had a side of beans an rice, this place makes me feel like the two are underrated because they were awesome.  Tasty tortilla chips and wierdly yummy hot sauce; I say weirdly because you think you're getting run of the mill little containers, but its actually really tasty with some subtle spice and just a really good taste. Its a tiny place, but the owner was really friendly. Only two downsides: no soda fountain and I wish I knew it was there a year ago when it opened.

PS I will come back forever until I am too fat to make the trip."}
{"text":"So weird. I thought my burrito tasted like Chinese food also. And my husband thought the tacos had Italian seasoning in them   Won't be back."}
{"text":"Ritos Surprise is the best Authentic Mexican food not only in Surprise but in the Valley. There customer service and family environment are second to none Richard the owner will remember your name after only your first visit & his wife and daughter run the kitchen and make the best Tacos & Red/Green chile burritos I have ever had. Okay there entire menu is AWESOME!!!My only complaint is they are closed on Sunday & Monday."}
{"text":"Great food !
Had the red chile burrito, was amazing.
Owner introduced himself and introduced his wife as well , very friendly and felt very welcoming - thanks and would  def. return again"}
{"text":"Let me start on a positive note, the meat is really tender and seasoned well. I ordered the green chili burrito with rice and beans enchilada style, my wife had the same thing except she ordered the red chili. My kids had the beef enchiladas. Because the burritos had a almost $12 price tag each, I had high expectations. After digging into what looked like a really big burrito almost floating in green chili sauce, 

I realized a quarter of the way through that I had only tasted shell, green chili sauce and beans. Once I got to the middle with the rice and meat, besides the slight salty after taste I could taste the potential. Once the limited amount of rice and meat was gone with what looked like a quarter of the burrito left, I opened up what was left and realized that it was it was only beans and shell left. I then realized it was 5, I repeat 5 layers of burrito shell!

When I can go to other places and get a burrito flooded with meat for less, why am I going to this place and paying for mainly shell and beans! As for the enchiladas, they had a really weird after taste and didn't get eaten by anyone! Oh, and I had to pay extra for hot sauce and chips. I expected a lot more after paying more than $30 for 2 burritos and 2 enchiladas! And I have a picture of the burrito shell cause I was shocked..."}
{"text":"I got the green chile beef burrito. ...really yummy! Really nice family running the place!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've eaten at a restaurant. It's as close to authentic Mexican food as you can get. AMAZING... It's the same food as the downtown location. Even the enchilada sauce is authentic and homemade, not that canned stuff you get at other restaurants."}
{"text":"We were excited to try a new place because it had four stars with over 200 reviews. But when we got there, unfortunately, we were not as pleased as we expected. The salsa was really bad tasting. It smelled like stinky socks. The food didn't have any flavor and they only serve chicken filling on Tuesdays. And all the other days you only have a choice of beef. There was no soda fountain. They only had soda and tea in a can. I tried really hard to get a smile out of the waitress that brought our food to the table, but I failed miserably. She would not crack a smile to save her life."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to get off work early on Friday and finally try this little spot out. Easily the best food I've had here in Surprise! I had the green chilli burrito and my mom got the green chilli enchilada. They were both delicious! I do have to say the customer service was exceptional! The owners were both so sweet and friendly! I can't wait to get off work early again to try something new off the menu!"}
{"text":"The worst attitude at the counter.  It was the owner too. I hope to shout his food is good because his service skills stink. We turned around and walked out."}
{"text":"So good!  So hard to find authentic mexican food in Az.  Most is Texmex or California gross mexican food.  This is absolutely the best!  Customer service rocks there! Very personable!  Take notes to other restaurants.  This is how it should be done."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Place is small. More of a lunch place. Food takes a while because it's fresh. Amazing chimichangos! Go! Definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"If you are in surprise and need authentic, delicious mexican food look no further. This place is the bomb.com. It rivals or beats Carolina's on most dishes and is just phenomenal. The limited hours are the only thing that keeps this place from making me a very large individual."}
{"text":"Not really sure how this place is still standing?  The Green Chile burrito was decent, but I have had much better. No fountain soda machines...Are you serious?  First time I came here to try it out it was 6:30pm during the week and they were closed?  Really?  Note to owner-  If you want to make $ stay open for the dinner crowd.  Must be a front or something because every time I drive by the place has no cars parked in front of it."}
{"text":"What a wonderful spot! Did a little yelp search after a Royals spring training game and came upon this gem of a place! Not only is the food delicious, but the owner, Richie, is a interesting and charming man. He truly cares about his customers experience and does what he can to improve upon it as best he can. Too bad I live in New York, cause this would definitely become a regular spot for me. Next time I am down for spring training this will be one of my first stops!"}
{"text":"I am so glad the hubby and I found this place.  The red chile chimi enchilada style I had was amazing and he had the green chile chimi enchilada style which was awesome too.  Richy, the owner was very friendly and welcoming.  Great place!  We have finally found good mexican food in Surprise!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! We've never tasted anything so good!!!!!Thank you Lenny. We will be back and will be sure to send our  friends and family your way! Order anything off the menu. You won't be disappointed:)"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service! We will be back. 

I suggest the chimichanga with green sauce! One of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Got the Green chili burrito enchilada style. I highly recommend this place. Locally owned. Same as the original Rito's in downtown Phoenix. Bomb."}
{"text":"I've been back twice now. The first time I ordered the Chimichanga green with beans. Muey delicious!!  The second visit I ordered the same enchilada style. Oh my gosh!  The best chimi ever!! 

The only problem is they close at 6 pm on weekdays. It's difficult o get there by six."}
{"text":"Ever since I moved to Arizona years ago, I have been desperate to find great Mexican food in the West Valley. When I tried Rito's, my search was over. This is where you get great Mexican food in the West Valley. I've gone multiple times and never been disappointed. Everything you eat here tastes fresh and fantastic. Burros, Enchiladas, Tacos...they are all great. As far as the portion size, the enchilada style burritos are huge. Ive never left the place hungry.The beans are probably the best refried beans I have ever tasted, the rice is cooked perfectly and the enchilada sauce is better than any place in AZ. The food is cooked fresh, so sometimes there is some waiting for your food, but if you don't want to wait you can always call your order in first or drive thru taco bell. 

I know they don't have the best hours, but they could be open for an hour a day at 3 AM and I would find a way to get there.

In short, eat here. Nothing in Surprise comes close."}
{"text":"This is the best family owned place in the west.  They own a place down town tucked away in a neighborhood across from a school, that's how it started,  Ritos wife named it after him.   You'll see pics of the family and more.  They like to call you by name, they make the food with love.

Try this place,  it's amazing.  I always get the green chili buro enchilada style!!"}
{"text":"Ok, where to start.  Drinks over priced, they offer cans and bottles of soda. 20oz coke 2$.  They obviously are restaurant rookies not being able to recognize the ability to make money off of a fountain machine.

I ordered a green chili beef burrito with beans inside.
Horrible!  First of all the burrito was like a water balloon,  NO Lie! I took 2 bites of salty water put it down and almost the entire burrito emptied on to the plate.  The green chili was almost non existent.   The beef was void of any flavor and had a color close to white.  

Salsa was something like a cross of spaghetti sauce and ketchup.  

Do you want any salsa, hot sauce, spice with you food?  Me too...  :-(

Save your money and time unless of course you want to waste them.

Oh, beside my wife, NO Mexican folks were seen anywhere, but plenty of 50-60's aged white folk enjoying the place."}
{"text":"food was just ok, prices were waaaaaay too high for a mexican joint, no self serve soda machine, got to order by the can so no refill !!!!!! owner needs to get a life, he has as much personality as a frog and is as friendly as a cobra."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I'm a really picky eater normally, but this place has a wide and convenient selection. The owner was so nice and patient and the friendly staff put a huge smile on my face. Definitely recommend this place! Plus the guacamole and green chili is spectacular. -Grace, Carrie, and Chris"}
{"text":"We love Rito's and try to visit as often as possible! Richie and Helen are such wonderful people and they always go out of their way to make us feel welcome! From our first visit on, Richie always greets us by name and gives our daughters a hug or a high five on the way out. That would be enough to make going to Rito's a great experience, but on top of the fantastic service, the food is outstanding every time. Their enchilada sauce is the best I've ever tasted, and the green chile is completely unique. I think we've tried everything on the menu and it's all amazing!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Mexican food I have ever had. They also were rude about they close at 6:30 pm. Who closes early on a Friday. I should have known when I didn't see a line waiting for the food I should have turned around."}
{"text":"Finally, I tried it after reading so much great reviews, but I didn't like it, i had much much better green chile else where about 99.9% of time. It's like biting into a burrito with bunch of slimy and gooey filings without any meat...Although, my wife liked it but this is my yelp review so, they get one star."}
{"text":"Great place. The gentleman at the register knew everyone by name, very friendly. It's so small I love it. You can tell they love what they do because it shows in the food. It's so good. My son went to town on some chips and ate some of the bean and cheese burrito, he's only a year and a half haha. We just moved down the street but we will be coming here for years to come. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Excellent Burrito.  Rice and beans for me usually end up in the trash but there's a reason you pay for them here: they are damn tasty."}
{"text":"If the owner's gruffness doesn't bother you, you will enjoy the food.  I have a feeling he's just gruff until he gets to know you.  I had the regular bean and cheese burrito and my wife ordered the green chile burrito enchilada style.  Both meals were delicious.  I especially like the tortilla.  The green chile burrito enchilada style was a little pricey.  The restaurant is small, lacks ambience but is immaculate -so- I recommend either ordering out or getting there early to get a table.  Service takes a little longer than usual because the meals are not cooked until ordered -but- the wait is well worth it.  I would have given this restaurant five stars except for the gruffness of the owner and the fact that we had to pay for water ($1 a bottle)."}
{"text":"Yum! Love the food. Love the salsa. Good and spicy. All our take out orders are always right and the girls are so nice and sweet. Haley I remember!"}
{"text":"We go every week, I love the enchiladas, New Mexico chile yum. Take out mainly no beer or margaritas!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Taco, loved the homemade taco shell but the beef was extremely salty. Chips and salsa were good, but again too salty. And I love salt!   My mom ordered the beef chimichanga enchilada style, she said it was not fried enough and the inside was very soupy. The green chili sauce was hot and they will not let your order it on the side and so it is super soggy. It was worth the try, but Seattle still has some of Mexican god ever!  And the search continues here in Arizona."}
{"text":"Owner is very friendly and seemingly has a remarkable memory for names, he called me by name several times. Nice clean premises, limited seating for perhaps 30 people. Food is served in disposable plates or foil cake pans. Soda is either bottles or cans. Green chili burrito was tasty but scant on beef, only a couple of ounces in mine with lots of sauce ( gravy) I ordered enchilada style per his recommendation but between the sauce and filling was very soupy. I also ordered beans which are also thin which added to the problem. Having only a plastic fork made it difficult to eat. My wife has the same thing except no sauce or beans and thought it was good but very little meat. All in all it was okay but I think I would prefer a place that serves food with dishes and flatware."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!! The owner is so amazing and friendly. The food is worth the drive no matter where you live. My fav is green chili burrito. Come visit them and find out for yourself"}
{"text":"I love the bean burrito enchilada style. I used to go to the one in Phoenix since I used to work in the area, I am so glad they opened a location near me in Surprise, the food is delicious. I just wish they would deliver or participate in Yelp, UberEATS, GrubHub etc..."}
{"text":"Had to try this place when we noticed it up in Surprise last week. Sunday and Monday closed so we had to come back!! Growing up on Colorado green chili verde has made it very hard to find anything close (Santiago's!!) 
I ordered a green chili burrito 'smothered' but wanted beans and beef inside. Not really sure what I got but there was only beans and green chili inside. I did pay just over $10 so I got charged but didn't get what I ordered. Should have been $8.40 according to the menu. With that said, it was very good, lots of pork and a generous amount of chili on the outside. Cheese and lettuce made it great. Wish there was a hotter option but by far the best chili I have had anywhere all over Southern California and Arizona since I moved 8 years ago. Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Rito's Mexican has the potential to be my go-to spot during my annual baseball Spring Training pilgrimage to Surprise, AZ.  They are literally a couple blocks from Surprise Stadium which is shared by the Royals and Rangers, the food is reasonably priced, the environment is very casual so you'll feel comfortable wearing team jerseys and other sports fan apparel, and they offer something that is difficult to find in the rest of the country - authentic green chili sauce.

Their food is positioned squarely in the \"pretty good\" / \"not too bad\" range, servings are larger than one person can eat (or more accurately, the servings are more than one person SHOULD eat) and they serve you quickly enough that you can grab a bite between the end of the practice field warm up sessions and the beginning of the actual Spring Training games.

I heard rumors from some vacationing baseball fans and a couple locals that the food consistency and the friendliness of the staff had gone downhill over the past several months.  Coincidentally, the day of my visit on March 20, 2017 happened to be the first day the restaurant was taken over by not just a new manager, but an entirely new crew.  They all did a pretty good job considering I could hear them asking each other in the kitchen if they had found certain items yet.  The staff assured me they did not intend to change any of the menu items or the recipes.

I'm confident that after the new team gets their feet on the ground, this cute little casual spot will live up to its potential.  I intend to return next year to see the result of their efforts."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a truly good green chili burro for years and I finally found one at Rito's.  In addition the staff was so nice and friendly. The owner behind the counter introduced me to his wife and niece and then proceeded to give me a recommendation since it was my first time there.  I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"We went into Rito's the other day for lunch. I've been to the location in Phoenix and I enjoyed it very much. The location in Surprise did not disappoint the green chili was excellent as were the refried beans. This place is definitely a step above the filibertos type of restaurant. Highly recommend.... The only thing I would say is there are no fountain drinks which is a little disappointing and the location is pretty small so you may not get a table it's mostly for takeout. And the prices are little bit high for semi fast mexican food. All things being said if you went to Rito's you would not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Decided to try it, pulled in, saw the open sign and headed in. As I was looking at the menu a gentleman asked if I wanted a to go menu \"yes please\". He then proceeds to say \"Maybe the next time you come in you can try us, we close in 1 minute.\" Confused by this is started looking around so he flipped over my menu and said see 6 o'clock we are closed so try us some other time.
I live 45 minutes away for one thing. Another is that if you don't put up the closed sign you're still serving. When I was a restaurant manager I had to take customer until the minute I closed those doors. Terrible customer service and I will  not be back to try the food."}
{"text":"The green chili sauce is super tasty. But the burrito only had sauce inside with maybe...five pieces of cubed beef.  The people who worked there were very nice, but definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great food and super friendly staff .... Not a large dining room so we were lucky to get table. Fast service from order to food delivery ... Green sauce very hot ... Order 2 drinks!!"}
{"text":"Not too impressed with this place.  First of all, the prices are too high.  $3.60 for a taco that has guacamole?  And for the amount of guacamole I did get, I can't believe I had to pay extra for it.

The menu was incredibly limited.  Other than beef, they offered no chicken or shrimp dishes.  Very odd.   And no fountain drinks.  And they were slow.  Don't believe all the 5 star reviews."}
{"text":"Okay, all I have to say is \"wow\"! Taking my heart away as the best simple Mexican fare in the area. 

Yes they are small, but it is a family-run place and Richie, the co-owner, was fantastic. I know what I like, he made his suggestions and it was on! Service was great, but the food was even better. 

My only wish is that they were open a bit later, but I am fine as-is!"}
{"text":"Great food, family friendly! This is one of the best meals I had in long time. The enchiladas and burrito were so good we couldn't stop till it was gone."}
{"text":"Best. Mexican Food. Ever. 

Take the green enchilada sauce left over after you devoured the green beef enchilada, and pour it on top of the beef-guac taco you got just in case you were still hungry after the enchilada. Trust me."}
{"text":"OMG This food should be considered a drug!!!!!!! It is so addicting. Betty Ford I hope you have a new clinic for people like me that are addicted to Rito's."}
{"text":"The folks who complain about this place obviously don't know real Mexican food and they must eat at a lot of chains. Ritos is awesome eat there at least once a week! Great family owned Resturant with traditional cooking! Go see for yourself and be your own judge!!"}
{"text":"I'm with a few of the other reviewers-- I must not get it. The food was bland, the service was just below average. Living in Arizona, we have access to better Mexican food than this. It is better than Taco Bell-- but not by much. I can think of other establishments I would rather frequent this Rito's."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing! We had the green chile enchilada style! When it first came out I thought I wasn't going to finish but it was so good I couldn't stop! Definitely our go to place now. Super friendly people made us feel so welcome!!"}
{"text":"Not only are their hours HORRIBLE (we have to eat dinner before 5 in order to eat there because they close so early) but when I finally order take-out they are out of beans. Really? I don't care how good the green chile is. I guess this place is only good for lunch."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Met Rich, good guy, good place, good food! Ill definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was unimpressed this visit. Maybe new management? Did not receive the friendliest customer service from the young blonde. Chili burrito was just okay and didn't seem worth what I paid. Might give it another try down the road."}
{"text":"I read all the great reviews on Yelp but was a little skeptical when pulling up. The store front is indescript and no frills interior but that's not why I was here. As a person currently living in Washington DC, good mexican food is hard to find. 

I was in the mood for a chimichanga and was suggested the green chili and beef. It did not disappoint. It was really good and living most of my life in California I've had good mexican food. This place is the bomb and I'll be coming back. People here are extremely friendly too as opposed to the northeast folks."}
{"text":"I am half beaner and I grew up more on the Mexican side.
I have been to a lot of Mexican Restaurants here and out side the U.S.
The Menue at this place is very generic and very poor as far as items.
I ordered the Green Chili burrito only to find i didnt order it wet!!! It was dripping with water literally.
I had to send it back.
This place is a step above Taco Bell for greengos.
No waitress no waiter very unorganized.
Save your money better off at Churches Chicken across the way.
Sad days"}
{"text":"I'm from NM and it's been a challenge to find good Mexican food like back home.  Rito's is one of the closest to it and absolutely mouth watering!  Rito's is by far the BEST Mexican food in Surprise, AZ.   Our family has been going to Rito's since it opened in Surprise and as of today it's expanded the seating area and extended the hours.   My husband loves the tacos and I love the beef burrito enchilada style with the green chili.   The green chili is BOMB!  Rito's is a \"must try\" for anyone that appreciates good tasting Mexican food."}
{"text":"Ritos is continuing to impress.  Consistent fresh homemade food.  I don't think its fair that they have received the few 1 star ratings that they have so I am updating my review.  Everyone who has given them a bad review has not even attempted to eat their food.  Its a restaurant.  In order to give a fair review, you have to eat the food.  The owner is always very polite, but he's also pretty honest.  If you are rude, he will most probably let you know, so the other reviewers obviously aren't telling the whole story.  This is the best place to eat in Phoenix, let alone Surprise."}
{"text":"Great food great service. Super happy for the location in Surprise. Family have been loyal customers for over 20years from Phoenix."}
{"text":"The green chili burrito enchilada style is amazing! The chili is perfectly seasoned, not too mild or hot. The beans are silky smooth and delicious!  Also the owner is so friendly. He is always genuinely happy to see you. He makes it a point to get to know you and call you by name.  I would rate Ritos higher than 5 stars if there was an option!"}
{"text":"Best bean burritos my wife and I have ever had on the west side.  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"The nachos were great. The enchiladas as well. The owners are really nice people. Rice and beans were awesome. The only thing is chicken is not an option. Which is not a problem for me but it is for others who don't normally eat beef."}
{"text":"Great local Mexican spot. In surprise our choices are limited... So a great local establishment such as this deserves our praise. I'll eat here any day of the week."}
{"text":"Didn't really remember this place, didnt blow our minds. its a \"sit and chat\" type place to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Great family owned Resturant! The green sauce is so tasty and you can't go wrong with the nachos or a taco! Friendly staff, knew everyone's name! Will come back when in town!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and super friendly staff! The green chili burritos are the best! We come here anytime we are in the area."}
{"text":"Best somewhat fast food in Surprise! Green and red Chile burritos are awesome as well as the tacos. And you can't beat their beans and rice! Only downfall to this place is not having a soda fountain, have to buy a can of soda at the counter.  I normally do takeout for that reason."}
{"text":"Great food, salsa. Owners are awesome can eat a great meal. Always a great time when we cone."}
{"text":"Warning:  This place closes at six on weekdays and closes at five on Saturday.  ***ALSO CLOSED ON MONDAYS****  You have been warned.

Tried Ritos again during their regular business hours after being shut down the first time.  I tried the guacamole beef tacos and green chile burro.  The guacamole tacos were amazing.  Crisp, fresh, lots of toppings, and the guac is smooth and goes great.  Do not order a taco without it.  The green chile is also delicious.  Just like the other Ritos.  A little heat, a lot of flavor, the pork sucks it up wondefully.  All in a perfectly homemade tortilla.  

I met the owner Richie who was a great guy.  Surprise is very lucky to have such a great spot serving out real Mexican food from scratch.  A few thing keep it from five stars.  Number one is the hours.  More power to them to close so early but as a customer it is harsh.  The salsa is tasty but on the tomato sauce side.  I like more heat and less sauce texture.  The price is also pretty high for take out Mexican food.  But what do I know?  This family has been slaying green chile since I was in diapers.

That being said I will continue to play ball and go early and pay the price cause the food is so damn good.  Nice work guys."}
{"text":"The food is good but oh my word 4 dollars for a taco. Way over priced. That's why they went down in ratings. What a shame."}
{"text":"We don't live in the area but decided to give it a try. I am glad that we did! The food was excellent, place was very clean, and service was top notch. We always like to support local family owned businesses. I had the beef taco and a green chili burrito and the green chili there is some of the best I have ever tasted. My wife had the bean and cheese burrito which was as big as her and she ate more than I've ever seen her eat before. We live way out in Goodyear but we will definitely be back. You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Wow, the Mexican food here is silly good.  Cooked by Rito's sweet wife. I lunch here at least twice week. Food is always consistently delicious. Give it a try."}
{"text":"We ate here a few weeks ago when the Royals' practice was rained out. So glad we did! The owner was so nice and great to talk with. The food was very good - awesome tacos! They feature takeout so their seating is a little limited, but we really enjoyed this place! Great meal before a baseball game!"}
{"text":"Best \"green chile\" I've found in az. This place is pretty dang good. I'm glad I remembered to come back since I found literally the best green chile chicken burrito since I moved here from Santa Fe. 

I practically gave up finding green chile but I was in the motorcycle shop next door and they re come des the place. I'm glad they did. 

The owners are super attentive. They want to make sure you enjoy the food. It's as if they actually care or something. I know, huh. Weird. ;)"}
{"text":"Great clean little place, this is now my go to for Mexican food. I got a chimi, and it was amazing. Everything was fresh and made to order, can't really ask for anything more."}
{"text":"Would have given higher but they don't seem to care or even know if the tortilla shells use are gluten free. They did say the beans are not gluten free just because it's easier to cook that way."}
{"text":"After a Valentine's Day debacle headed up to Anita's in Wickenburg, we decided to try this place.  The Green Chimichanga is ridiculously good.  Tasty, flavorful and not over-fried.  Friendly people, friendly service, good homemade Mexican.  Will definitely head up here again."}
{"text":"Great tacos and everyone is friendly. This is my new favorite place to eat. 

I have eaten here three times and each time I have tried something different. Everything has been delicious. The red chili had a good spice to it and the green chili was tasty.  The tacos are my favorite."}
{"text":"Today I walked into Rito's with high hopes because of the great reviews unfortunately for them those high hopes came with high expectations. Those expectations were not met,  don't get me wrong the food wasn't bad it was average to slightly above average. I feel as though if you grew up on their enchilada sauce you would think it was the best around, but from an outsider's perspective I didn't see what all the fuss was about. 

Worth stopping at if you happen to be in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there. 

On a better note I almost gave Rito's a 4 star rating because the staff was so friendly and nice. 

With so much high quality Mexican food in the Southwest United States this is a can miss restaurant, very nice people and I wish them the best."}
{"text":"I figured with all the good reviews that I would love this place. I was wrong. I ordered the chile green and red burritos, one of each just in case I didn't like the other. Both tasted pretty nasty to me. I was hoping it would have at least a semi authentic taste, but the meat tasted as if it came from a can, and not off the bone. I could only stomach about 3 bites of each."}
{"text":"The Best! We moved from California and were expecting to easily find great Mexican food, but all we found were the big chains.  Then we found Ritos!  We have been there twice in a week and will continue to frequent it.  I love, love, love the bean burrito, enchilada style.  My DH is very fond of the guacamole.   Maybe next time I will try something else, but I really love that creamy bean burrito with the yummy enchilada sauce!"}
{"text":"Plain and simple, but good food. I believe related to the Ritos downtown, but without the name you wouldn't know it."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! I really wanted to like this place based on the reviews alone, but based on the customer service alone I would not spend another penny here. When I asked for extra hot sauce (which I figured I'd be paying extra for) they told me, \"No, I think you'll be fine.\" When I insisted that I wanted to purchase extra salsa, they said that I should have added that to my online order and now I'll have to go back to the end of the line (6 people in line) to order some. What kind of customer service is that? Look, I know it's not going to mean much to this company that I won't be going back, but with all of the restaurant choices around here you'd think customer service would be great along with the food. The food itself was okay- nothing amazing but not bad."}
{"text":"Great food loved the green chili burrito and beans were awesome. Wife had the beef tacos with guacamole which I also tasted and thought it was pretty good.....wife said it was okay? The folks there are very friendly and attentive. My only gripe is the pricing......WOW!!! Tacos were like $2.80 a piece and nothing else, beans and rice are a la carte and not cheap either. The burrito was also about $6 dollars.......as good as it is its still just a burrito. So if you don't mind paying inflated prices for good food this is your place. I will probably return when I get the 2nd mortgage on the house"}
{"text":"Don't know what happened. They used to be really good & have good portion sizes, but after eating there for the 1st time in 6 months we were definitely NOT impressed. Not as much meat & LITERALLY only had Meat, no Chicken or Carne Asada"}
{"text":"This is only our second time here and Richie remembered our names. The atmosphere is very family friendly. The food is unbelievable. The beans melt in your mouth and the green Chile is out of this world!"}
{"text":"We have been Ritos burritos  fans for many years!! Specifically for the location of 51st Avenue and Glendale. We moved further out west and we're sad that we would no longer be able to enjoy our Ritos burritos as often as we did! To our great surprise we found a RITOs  located in surprise! Let me say we were not disappointed the red chili burrito was just as good or actually my husband thinks was even better than what we've had before. The beans were great , very tasty, however a bit thicker . My only critique would be that I would like to have the cheese Tortilla to be a little bit crispier ! Overall we recommend this restaurant for some good authentic red and green burritos! We recommend this location if you have grown to love the original RITOs!!!!!! Also another plus size they accept credit and debit cards!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Today was the 1st time that i enjoyed Rito's at the Surprise location.  I usually get take out from their downtown location.  I will say that Surprise did not disappoint.  The green chile burrito enchilada style was on point. So so good.  Everything is so fresh. Helen was very nice.  My family and i will be back.  it is great to have this food on the Westside."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best!!! I love the green chilli chimichanga!!! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Needed some quick food tonight and found this place on Yelp. Closes at 6 on weekdays so I had to rush over there to get take-out. No combinations, everything is a la carte and it can get pricey. The beef tacos were very tasty, the rice was also good, but not a fan of the beans. Almost soup-like texture and I prefer a whole pinto bean style. 
They seem to make everything from scratch so they might not have everything still available at the end of the day. I definitely want to try this place again now that I know the in's and out's of it a little better."}
{"text":"Had the taco salad, it was so so.  Not enough green chili meat and a chewy taco shell but overall it had a good flavor.  I was wanting to love this place because of all the good reviews!? Kids liked their tacos.  Had to pay for water, no fountain drinks here.  But to their credit I do have to say they were very friendly and I'll give it another try!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Every time. Definitely my favorite green chile! There are tacos & other burritos on the menu, and I'm sure you can't go wrong with anything you choose. But I am obsessed w/ the green chile burros, so haven't tried anything else.
Since they made the place bigger, it looks great! Staff is always always friendly, too!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever I would never eat at this place I walked in and they told me that they were only dining in till 5:30 and if I could take my food to go then the man ask me and last I want to come back another day and dine in very rude no customer service and not to mention this is about the 6th time I try to eat at one of these places around town 30 liter of closed and the service sucks"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place a 3 stars is because everything they sell on the menu is a la carte. Including the chips and salsa what the heck. All of the  Mexican food places I've frequented offer complimentary chips and salsa. And all offer combination plates. We had a green chili chimichanga and two shredded beef tacos. Not out of this world average taste . The salsa they offer has a good taste but has the consistency of water. Will we visit this place again probably not . Prefer places that offer complimentary chips and salsa and combination plates."}
{"text":"First time today. Small place, seats probably 25 or so. Menu on the wall isn't the same as the menu they have at the desk when you order. Some minor things are different. So be prepared for that.

I was greeted by the owner. He seemed frustrated. He was short with me and when I ordered, he would ask me if I was sure and replied \"we don't do that in Phoenix\" when I wanted red sauce inside the burrito. He asked me if it was my first time. I told him it was. He chuckled and told me he wouldn't hold it against me.  When I asked for green sauce on the side, he asked me \"why in the world would you want it on the side\". I was done with the banter and told him to just make it \"how they do it in Phoenix\". 

Food was quick and drinks are in the bottle, no fountain drinks. 

From my understanding they are well known for their refried beans. They do deserve the recognition, because the refried beans were great. The green chili was good. Everything besides that was average. 

I would've gave it four stars, but that snappy and \"eat and get out\" attitude just ruined it for me.  

I would recommend getting it to go so you don't have to experience the customer service."}
{"text":"We stopped in today.  We ordered the red chile chimichanga enchilada style and the green chile chimi enchilada style.  Both were amazing.  The owners were friendly and welcoming.  They seemed to really care about our opinion on the food.  Small place, be ready to get it to go. This is the same as the Rito's downtown and it makes me so happy."}
{"text":"What a find and what nice people.  I've passed by the Surprise location many times but after becoming disenchanted with another Mexican Food restaurant we've been doing without.  Finally today after reading other reviewers comments I decided to give them a try.  Richie treated me like I mattered to him and the lady who cashed me out was a delight.  The food was excellent and economical too.  We both had the Green Chili Beef Enchiladas with beans and it was a belly filler of great taste.  I live nearby and will be a regular from now on."}
{"text":"AWESOME.... The old timer behind the counter is a HOOT! He remembers everyone's name and is super friendly! Food is amazing!  Not fast food or Taco shop food at all!!! I wish they did nachos and were open later... Can't say enough about this place. A must try!"}
{"text":"Best green chili burros!! Thanks Ritchie for another awesome meal!  Try a beef taco.  Another favorite."}
{"text":"Great green chili burros. I am addicted. The taco's have fresh made taco shells and shredded beef. The only downside is they need to stay open later."}
{"text":"Had the green chili enchilada style with rice and beans. Best I have had in AZ. Sooo Good!!"}
{"text":"My family loves it here. Food is fantastic. Price is right. Service is good although they need a bigger space with longer hours to include dinnertime. My out-of-town guests want to go there before they reach our house. Beef tacos are good."}
{"text":"FINALLY! 

I FINALLY found some amazing NM style mexican food! This is the real deal here.  There's only a few tables & nothing is pre-made so each order takes a bit of time so be prepared for a bit of a wait.  I ordered the beef green chile burrito smothered with green chile & a side of guacamole, husband ordered a bean burrito & chips & salsa.  I was floored when I saw the size of our burritos but even more stoked when I took my first bite...AMAZING! So flavorful & delicious. These are not your normal burritos that you can just eat out of the foil, these are more like \"fork & knife on a plate\" kind of burritos.  They are jam packed with filling & ooze out of both ends. The guacamole was the perfect side for my burrito. I can't wait to come back & try their chimichangas, they looked deeeelish.  Only downfall, the hours stink! 11-5 & closed on Sunday & Mondays...boo!"}
{"text":"Ritos has some of the best beef tacos out in surprise! They are always so nice and I really enjoy the new store improvements !"}
{"text":"Not enough food for the price. I got a beef burrito and it hardly any meat in it and nothing else. It cost $10 not worth that at all."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but I have to retract my comment on my recent check in for this place. I have not been here in many months, and on today's visit I again had their Green Chile Burro enchilada style. The burrito was very bland, and had very little meat in it. It was almost completely made of a thick gravy, and nothing else. I saw no Green Chile, and only one or two pieces of onion. I was charged $10.13 for this burrito, and I'm not sure how they got that total since the price was only $8.15. That's just way to much for what it was. In most Mexican restaurants that would have come with chips and salsa, and maybe even rice and beans for that amount. I will not be back again."}
{"text":"Best Green Chili burro in the valley.  The service is great .  I get all my Mexican food at Ritos."}
{"text":"I have been looking so hard for GOOD Mexican food in the Phoenix area and I finally after 8 months found it here. The green chili burrito is SO amazingly good. Try it enchilada style, even better. The owner Richie is a great man and knew my name the second time I went in (over a month apart) and every person who came in and out he knew by name. If you haven't tried it you need to. The only disappointment, they are closed Sunday and Monday :("}
{"text":"I love love love Mom and Pop places, and Rito's fits the bill. We were in town visiting grandparents and found Rito's. We are from San Diego, so while this Mexican fare is more like southwest style, it was amazing! The owner made sure we enjoyed our meal. He chatted with our kids and us. And he even gave the kids surprise sucker lollipops after they finished their meal (he asked me for permission first)

Hubby had the chimichanga in green chili sauce enchilada style. I had the green chili taco salad. Our 3 kids had a side of rice and beans each (we eat at taco shops alot at home, and that is their typical order). The green chili sauce was absolutely amazing! Wow!

What a great place. If we ever come back to Surprise, we will be back. They are closed Sunday and Monday. We visited on a Saturday, and were hoping we could eat here again before leaving Surprise, but sadly, we return to San Diego on Monday.

About the reviews commenting on small eating area - true, but there are 3 tables that  fit 6,  and 2 tables that fit 2-3. Definitely aimed at take out, but not hard to eat there. Plus eating there you get the experience of seeing a true family run business."}
{"text":"Being a native Arizonan, I grew up eating honest to goodness fresh made mexican food.  This is the place for it.  Outstanding burros, enchiladas and tacos.  In my opinion none better in Surprise.  Richie, the owner is a real people person.  Knows my name and greets me by it when I walk in the door.  He treats my 7 year old son like royalty too .  It is spicier than other establishments, but if you're ok with that, then you should try this restaurant.  Mostly for take out, only a few cafeteria style tables, so don't plan an intimate sit down meal here. Their hours are limited, only open until 6PM M- F and 5PM Sat so plan accordingly.  Once you eat here you wont be back to the local chain a mile North of here."}
{"text":"This location is just as good as the one in Downtown Phoenix. I was looking for a place to eat after golfing, and this showed up on Yelp. Thank god! This place is awesome. You gotta try the the red beef burro enchilada style. Do it!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Richie is great. Food is amazing, menu is not extensive but what they do they do really well. If you are hungry and like a good burrito you gotta try Rito's"}
{"text":"Just have to add that I'm addicted to their taco salad.  I've even got my friends hooked.

Try it.  You won't be sorry!  Their green sauce & generous serving of meat is mouth pleasing & did I mention addictive?"}
{"text":"I have to agree with Mr. Floyd green chili burrito is fantastic!! Great service ask for marissa she will give you service with a smile :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this Mexican takeout restaurant. I guess you can dine in as there are a few seats and tables available. The staff is polite and courteous. The interior is small but clean. The food is freshly prepared and the portions are large. Everything is a la cart. The menu is limited and the prices are a bit high. I would likely come here more often if it were more affordable. Call in ahead because if you don't, you'll be waiting for a lifetime in there."}
{"text":"Rito's is awesome. They make the best beans and have great green chili. The service is always fantastic. I will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and its made fresh after you order. The sauce has a nice bite to it.  The burritos are full size and the enchilada was excellent. The beef was oh so good. Get the guacamole made fresh also. They also have Mexican Coke in bottles.  A must stop if you want excellent food."}
{"text":"So we bought a big tray of beans tostada shekels and rice for a party we had. Everyone loved the beans and rice. The only thing I thought the price was kind of expensive for one tray of beans 75 tostada shells and one tray of rice everything was $137.00.  I know these are reAlly good beans but making this myself would have cost me way under $20 for the beans and rice."}
{"text":"This place is great. Add beans to the green chile burrito if you don't like it too spicy. I had the tacos with guacamole, yummy. The only meat is angus beef, so don't ask for chicken."}
{"text":"I can't speak to too many items on the menu since I haven't tried that many.  Usually when I find something that I like, I stick to it.  I tried the fried taco.  I really did enjoy it, so I ordered another one. 

This is a small place good for lunch.  Good service too."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in all of Surprise! Everything on the menu is to die for for! Red chilie beef and bean burrito is my all time favorite! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Been hearing a lot about this place and wanted to try it out, 
Rito's is a little dive off of Reems, Supposedly they have another location elsewhere. So the girls and I came in for dinner, thank fully we had an early dinner. Rito's closes at 6:00pm! Kind of early to close? 
So we walked in, and ordered:
Green Chili Burrito
Red beef enchilada
Shreaded beef tacos
we also added a side of rice and beans. 
Their drinks only come in bottles or cans, when we ordered the drinks he was more worried about the girls spilling the drinks on the floor then taking my order. We haven't even sit down yet and the owner is already complaining. Since this is a very small place, seats are limited. When someone asked if she can move two table together so they can sit four people. He replied not to slide the table but to pick up the tables so they don't scratch the floor. Again, he wanted to confront the situation, All he had to do was to say no problem, I'll take care of it for you? 
With all of this said,
Their green chili burrito is amazing! I grew up with hatch green chili. When my grandmother passed away I have been looking for anything close to her chili verde. Sylvia's La Canasta on Indian School Rd have been very close to that taste, however Rito's just became my favorite place to get my green chili! It blows me away how some of the reviews on here are criticizing their chili verde! Sorry, but if you don't like the chili verde from Rito's, then you don't know how green chili is suppose to taste like! 
The girls loved their tacos, the red beef enchilada was good. I am not a huge fan of their sauce, I prefer Garcia's on 35th Ave enchilada sauce. 
The owner needs to lighten up a bit, Surprise is a grave yard for a lot of business, and I wouldn't want to see this place on its list. Rito's really needs to get a fountain machine. Being overcharged on cans and bottles will only last for so long. And you need to extend your hours! 
I absolutely recommend this place for their food!"}
{"text":"So friendly and the Green Chili Burrito is ridiculously AWESOME!!! Glad you guys are in Surprise!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch before going to the Royals game at Surprise Stadium. We read all the positive reviews on Yelp, so we figured it must be a winner. We had a really nice conversation with the owner regarding the various menu options. He told us Rito's is best known for its green chili burritos, so a couple members of our party ordered those. I had a taco and a green chili beef enchilada. Both were great. The green chili sauce was quite tasty on the enchilada. It's not really hot, but it does have a little kick to it. The taco was superb. The shell was authentic, not some silly Old El Paso shell someone got at Wal-Mart. The filling was even better. Perfect meat to cheese/lettuce ratio. The burritos are BIG and the folks in our party who ordered them were pleased. Also it's definitely worth it to get an order of chips and hot sauce. The sauce is sort of hot, but delicious. It's got a unique and addictive flavor. The chips are also very fresh and perfectly salted. We'll definitely dine here on our next spring training trip. Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"The green burrito is great.   Wish they were open later though."}
{"text":"Had read the reviews and been wanting to try this place since moving to Surprise. Being they close at 4pm-5pm hasn't made it easy to come and try the place out since I get off work at same time as closing. We ordered chips and salsa, two chimi's and a side of rice and beans. $35.64, outrageously high compared to other similar restaurants close by. Chips and salsa was just ok, chips were nice and thin but stale and cold. We ordered a red chili with green sauce and a green chili with green sauce. Red had no flavor and green was very salty. They don't offer chicken which is a let down. The rice was dry and the beans were burnt. I would skip this place and try Riva's down the street. Better selection, value and taste."}
{"text":"Some of the best chimichangas to date! This is the 2nd location to open up on this family owned restaurant.  I think the other location, the original one, is downtown. 

There is only the beef option available on their chimis, which really surprised me that there wasn't chicken available too. However, once I took a bite of the gigantic chimichanga, I realized why they don't have more than one option. Why mess up \"perfection?\"

Definitely come here and try the chimis here. They are delicious. The flavorful red and green salsas are wonderful as well! I believe there are burritos here too, so I will try one of those next time. Or then again, maybe I'll just choose the chimi again, because I'd regret not getting one. If you meet the owner, it's great speaking with him, because you can really tell he and his wife love cooking and they really take pride in the results and it shows in the memorable combination of bold and spicy flavors."}
{"text":"Always excellent amazing burritos and chimis. Beans and rice are also perfect. You won't go wrong. Better than any fast food Mexican restaurant around."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this restaurant more times than I can count and it's delicious EVERY TIME!!! They have never messed my order up! They are family owned and operated and I love this family! They are always so friendly! They only use the most fresh ingredients and I am always satisfied! I highly recommend them to anyone looking for authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Merely ok at best. I wouldn't go back. Overpriced for what you get for your money. Prefer Chipotle over this place any day."}
{"text":"First time here and based on the other reviews I was disappointed.  First,  the layout was confusing.  The place you order was in the back.  There was one photocopy menu and someone else was using it.  After a bit we noticed that there was a menu up and to the right.  Out of the way.   Second, there was a employee meeting going on and we could hear the entire thing.  Even when the person running it was talking about the yelp reviews.  Third the food was ok,  just ok.  Not a ton of options.  We are not a huge red meat family and that was the only options for meat.  Not somewhere we will visit again."}
{"text":"I strongly discourage going here if you value being treated kindly. I just went here with my grandmother and couldn't even look at their menu because the man at the counter criticized, insulted and recommended I go somewhere else the entire time. I simple asked if they have carne asada and he said \" we don't have chicken, pork or anything but green chili and beef and if you don't like it you can go somewhere else I have no problem with that. I asked him to at least let me look at the menu and stop yelling at us. He proceeded to not let me even look at the menu and kept being a rude, loud, jerk telling us I obviously had a problem with the menu he wouldn't even give me a chance to look at and can go somewhere else, so we left. It was awkward and mean. Never knew asking for if carne was available was so offensive at a Mexican food shop. This guy was so mean he actually made me cry. I am also disabled so had a tiny service dog in a bag (clearly labeled service dog) so maybe that pissed him off. Instead turn left out the lot left again then on the right is a drive through and walk in I think it's called Riza's go there, it's a actual taco shop."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place, it was so authentic with amazing ingredients! I ordered just a normal bean and cheese burrito to see what they got, and I gotta say It was amazing I loved it. Not only was the food good, the costumer service was as well. I will defiantly be coming back."}
{"text":"Rito's food is really excellent but is a bit unhealthy.  I wish they served more chicken or fish, but they stick to the original recipes so are heavy in pork and beef.  Despite this the food is really very good and the chimichangas with green sauce and refried beans are some of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Great green chili beef chimichanga. I ordered without tomatoes. Five minutes later the owner came to ask me if I had an allergy because there were some tomatoes in the sauce. Very thoughtful."}
{"text":"Ritos is a hole in the wall that's filled with all things made with love. It is a family business and if ever there treat yourself to a bean, rice and cheese burrito. Your tummy will thank you and you will find yourself back for another."}
{"text":"I don't really understand why people go crazy over this place. It's not bad, but it's cheap Mexican food that doesn't feel or taste very authentic. Like so many restaurants in Surprise, this is just another adequate one - you can find way better Mexican food if you head east about 15-20 minutes."}
{"text":"We just had lunch at Rito's. We were looking for Mexican since we just got into town, found them on google. Although I was looking for a nice sit down restaurant I am so glad we stayed. (Very small walk in and order) we had the green chili burrito and green chili chimi. Best tasting thing I have eaten in a long time!! Very friendly. Even gave us extra sauce free being it was our first visit!! Go if you want to taste  deliciousness!!"}
{"text":"I live in Surprise but I rarely drive Reems, I have been missing this place for too long!!! I stumbled by when I started a CSA pickup at sunsational, and freaked! I noticed the sign that said same as downtown, I LOVED and recommended people to downtown a lot. Now I have it by me!?!?! So I went in and was fullllllly rewarded! Amazing food!!!! Seriously great enchilada style burrito! Can't wait to try the chimi!! And taco!! But even more, the brother who owns this location is a great business owner! He was sooooooo friendly! This is the place to go!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic!   I've been to the Orangewood location several times and loved it,  so this had a high standard set.  This place did not disappoint!   Once I had the green chile burro which was delicious.   The second time I had the guacamole taco and the bean and cheese tostado.  Amazing!  The service is excellent.   I highly recommend Rito's."}
{"text":"We came here because the reviews were good. I got a chicken burrito enchilada style. The sauce they use made it good. The reason why I am not giving it 5 stars is because they put very very little meat in the burrito. Other then that, the owner and staff are very nice"}
{"text":"Ridiculously delicious! Tried the chips and hot sauce and guacamole. Perfection. Ate the bean and green chimichanga for lunch. So good. The best part of this place is the owner. He's extremely personable. If I didn't live halfway across the valley, I'd be here every day."}
{"text":"1st time here the service was excellent. This place is extremely clean!! And smells amazing, The food was to die for very authentic and DELICIOUS! Highly recommend it...worth every penny!!! Wonderful place."}
{"text":"It doesn't get much better than this. This place has a small menu but great items you will keep coming back for. The green chili chimi...mmm so delish. You won't find good food like this many other places. This is one of those hole in the wall word of mouth places you will never forget.  

HUGE PLUS.. This location is now accepting cards and cash. 

This is a small family business so they have some funky hours, but it's worth the work to make it in. 

My family has been coming to the downtown location since I was little. They all taste the same. We are super happy that there is one closer to us."}
{"text":"I read from another review that they had mechaca burrito here but they obviously made a mistake because they've never ever had that burrito there they probably thought it was some berto's restaurant.
     Ok so recently I discovered more that there's a chimi style green chili burrito and it's incredible it's still got that same green chili heat but with an incredible crispy tortilla on the outside a major plus to this little gem!!!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp I found Rito's and what a wonderful find! On top of the fact that they have delicious Mexican food, the owners are always there and truly treat everyone who comes through the door like family. So far I've been there 3 times and even the second time they remembered me. 

I'd highly recommend trying the green chile beef. I've always shied away from saucy beef but am very happy I took a chance on it at Rito's. It's delicious!"}
{"text":"The best tasting quick Mexican food in town.  Been a fan of Rito's since I worked dowtown. The only have beef, bean options. Kind of like the In-n-Out of Mexican. A clean, simple and friendly restaurant. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love the food here, it is amazing. Super friendly and fast. I haven't found a better Mexican place around here."}
{"text":"Great steak burros and tacos! The taco shells are fried just right- lightly! Consistently good food with great customer service!"}
{"text":"Seriously the BEST green chili EVER!!!!! Should have an ADDICTIVE warning in their restaurant! Hahaha the staff is extremely great! Very friendly, homey place! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Disappointed yet again, it's been a few years since we had ritos. We we had a bad experience then and one again today. We knew we didn't want to dine in so we placed a pick up order. When we got to the restaurant we were treated very rudely by the female cooking. Once we got our order home, the food was okay. The burritos had little to almost no meet, and the enchiladas were overloaded with onions. I'm not sure if there has been a change in ownership but It's defiantly not the place I used to hear so much about."}
{"text":"Had the green chili beef with beans burrito. Very large portions, was just the right amount of medium spicy and was well stuffed."}
{"text":"We just ate there today and had rice, beans, chips and red sauce, chimichanga, and green burrito.    The food, all of it was excellent. The service friendly and professional. Spending 20 years in Colorado I thought I had already eaten the best green chili and tortillas. I was mistaken This is the best!"}
{"text":"Well, I must not get it!  With all the raving I must have had high expectations?  The owner was friendly, but asked and reasked my order several times. I was one of the first and only customers in there. So I ordered the bean tostada and green chili beef chimichanga:
The toastada was super crispy (impressive for take out) but didn't realize tomatoes are extra:/ The \"salsa\" sauce was good, it tasted fresh and had heat but wasn't super hot.  However the beans were like soup...dripping off the tostada and puréed to have no bean texture!? Personal preference?
  The green chili chimi was huge and with the bean(soup) & rice in the container it was super full. The rice was good and the spice of the green chili sauce was spicy and delicious, however the chimi wasn't fried?!  Or at least it wasn't fried well...it was pale and pasty without the crunchy bits that make a chimi awesome. I was particularly disappointed as the chimi is more expensive. Also if it is a beef chimi, I expect beef of which there was barely any...pics show what was inside...
Not a good first impression. I spent over $24 and won't even eat it. 
Bummer."}
{"text":"The owner was very attentive. Beast mexican yet in Surprise.  Beef only, no chicken no pork."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. The guacamole tacos, rice and beans were amazing!! The guy that took my order (I think the owner) was super nice. I like supporting small mom and pop places and we will definitely be back to this one."}
{"text":"We just moved into the neighborhood and craving some good Mexican food. The green chili beef burro was awesome! We can't wait to go back for more. The owners are super nice people that care about their food and customers experience. If your in the area you need to try this place."}
{"text":"I love this place every time I want to shredded chicken burrito this is where I'll go, at least once a week!!"}
{"text":"Limited menu means they are great at what they make. Worth a try. Green chimichanga incredible. Hard to find authentic Mexican food, this small place has it."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant with an amazing green chili beef specialty! The owner is very friendly and the staff is great! We're definitely recommend other people!"}
{"text":"To date the best Mexican food I've had in Arizona yet!  Small place with limited seating, but 100% worth it."}
{"text":"Used to eat at the original Rito's at 14 St & Garfield. Love that they opened this one in the NW Valley. Limited hours and menu, but the food is still outstanding. VERY limited seating and the indoor dining closes at 5:30, so come early. Good for takeout."}
{"text":"I'm reading these great reviews and wondering if I'm crazy or are all the other reviewers?  I hated this dumpy little place...not that I haven't found 5 star fabulous places, but I found the food great at those 5 star dumpy little places, too. I didn't find that at Rito's.
OK, so I take a friend after bragging that I Yelped the place and the reviews were great--and--as per her request--they had beer.  I knew that, because I looked at their menu shown on the internet.
#1.  Not the same menu AT ALL.  You have a very, very small menu at this place.  They show the fancy, long menu--with beer on it--from the other location instead of the handwritten 6-7 item on paper you order from here.  Not fair at all!
#2.  No beer at all here.
#3.  Ordered a burrito which was filled with some chunks of meat and oodles and oodles of green chili sauce, so essentially you are eating a tortilla with lots of green chili sauce.  Ick.
#4.  I must not be a New Mexico burrito kind of girl, cause the green chili sauce was just too darn hot for me.  Not my thang one bit.
My friend got the enchilada which looked passable.  I was so disappointed in Rito's that I didn't even ask if it was ok.
So, dear Yelpers, as you rave about this place, I give it a one star.
HUGE disappointment.....your discerning taste, Yelpers, has let me down this time."}
{"text":"Where do I begin. This place has incredible Mexican food. My favorite is the Green chili burro. The food is always fresh and what I enjoy most about this place is that it's always consistent. I've never had a bad meal here. Aside from their delicious food, they have one of the cleanest kitchens in the restaurant industry. I will admit that I like to observe what the kitchen looks like in most family run food places...I'm a firm believer that if it's a clean kitchen you are being served clean and properly handled food. 

The owners are also the sweetest couple! The owner is super friendly and personable. He remembered me the second time I went in. Give this place a try. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Omg. The best green chile verde ever!!"}
{"text":"Really good Carne asada burritos but, the tacos are kind of skimpy on the meat, have to order 2 to get the meat for 1. However, the rest of the menu is super yummy."}
{"text":"I love there dam burros so good and juicy the drinks were good my aunt had there beer she said it was delicious"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Everything is made fresh, including the shells for the tacos. They use Hatch green chili and their green chili burrito is what they are known for. Both of the owners waited on us and made us feel really important to them.  She told us twice that she was so happy that we had come in. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My friend told me she went here and it was bomb.com the Green Chile burrito and tacos !!!"}
{"text":"Stopped into this little shop after reading great reviews on Yelp. Everyone was right the food is outstanding. I had the mothered green chili chimi and it was fabulous. The inside of the place has lots of seating and the margaritas they serve from a tap are on point. If you are looking for outstanding Mexican food in Surprise look no further."}
{"text":"I love this place. Consistently delicious and great service. Some of the best mexican food in the valley. Do yourself a favor and come try it out."}
{"text":"Their Green Chile is AMAZING! I used to live in NM and that's the one thing I really miss having. I was introduced to this place a year ago and love going there to grab lunch. My family came to visit from and I took them all there for lunch. My dad was so pleased with the flavor that he's been trying to recreate it ever since without any luck lol. I definitely recommend this place to everyone looking for a fantastic green chile burrito"}
{"text":"Best burros, ever! Had the green chili burro, enchilada style with green sauce and the bean burro enchilada style with red sauce. AWESOME. The family vibe was even better! Marissa, is very welcoming and kind.! It will be my weekly stop! I'm serious! The Munoz family has proven how good they are by their success of Rito's in Central Phoenix. We are so lucky they have brought their good stuff to the west valley!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots. Green Chile is very good. New Mexico style. The green Chile burrito with beans is cheese is how I like it.  Red isn't bad either. Chimis are delicious. Love the shredded beef tacos. But if you just feel like beans....get a bean and cheese burro. Omg the beans are so delicious. Home made just like they are supposed to be. Beware you will get very sleepy after eating. Not good if you are working after a good lunch here."}
{"text":"The BEST Bean & Cheese Burritos we have ever tried. My husband is still talking about how fresh and tasty the tortillas alone are (and he has always favored his Mama's). I had Shredded Beef Tacos and they were great! This is a very small establishment and message on glass says \"We specialize in To Go orders. Space inside is limited.\" Worth the time you wait for food(not long. we went on CincoDeMayo and only waited 20 minutes for a large ToGo order.), money you spend and gas to get there. Definitely will go back again and again."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place ever got the good reviews it did. Ordered 2 beef enchiladas and got two tiny enchiladas swimming in grease with a little lettuce. The beef was cubes beef chunks that wasn't even flavored. For $10 was highly disappointed. Stopped somewhere else to get more food and to get the nasty after taste outta my mouth. Highly recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Just like the original classic Rito's in Phoenix. This place is small newer & very clean. Also it hasn't been as busy as the other locations. Not sure the city of surprise appreciates what they have here. No ice or soda machine so they sell by the can (think that's the same in other locations). Lots of call in ordered while we ate. Highly recommend checking this place out if you aren't familiar with old school authentic phoenix Mexican food. I love their green chili chimi & their beans are legit too. This location is on the NE corner in a strip mall."}
{"text":"My burrito consisted of 5 chunks of beef and about 16 ounces hot sauce. How in the hell is this place rated so good. Among the worst Mexican I've ever had"}
{"text":"An EXCELLENT place for fresh, hot Mexican food.  The menu is smaller but what they do, they do EXTREMELY well!  The beef is quality Angus and you won't find better food anywhere!"}
{"text":"My husband brought me one of the taco salads, and I think I died and went to heaven! It was delicious! The lettuce, tomatoes, and guacamole were super fresh, and tasted amazing. And the green chili beef was incredible! I will definitely be back, and I can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Great little spot for an excellent Mexican lunch. Only 10-15 tables but clean and tidy. Walk in and order, get a number, and they bring you your order. Fast and friendly, and made fresh. Smothered enchiladas with green chili are the bomb diggity. Red sauce is also delicious, but the green chili is a requirement. Best Mexican I've had in Surprise."}
{"text":"A true hideaway joint with exceptional attention to detail and flavor!"}
{"text":"I don't get this place. As it was my first time in there, I like to ask the employees what they recommend. They recommended their green chili burro. OK, I'm game for anything. 
Once it arrived, I was unimpressed. It already had lots of \"juice\" (water?) leaking out of it. I asked if they had hot sauce, and they said they did, for .75 - Ummmmmm, seriously? A Mexican place that charges for salsa? Well, I had to get it just to give the thing some sort of flavor! It didn't help much. I also asked for salt, which they said they didn't currently have, well that could explain some of the lack of flavor!
At the time I was there they were only accepting cash, which I told them I attempted to come in prior to that visit, but had no cash on me. For what I got, I thought it was overpriced, and bland.
I haven't been back for awhile, but with the hit and miss reviews, it doesn't look like I'll be rushing back anytime soon either."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 6 or more stars I would! The hatch chile used with the green chile burrito is epic! The red chile was also cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Best bean and cheese burrito in Phoenix. I live downtown next the original restaurant and they have the exact same food. Staff is always friendly and happy to see you come in."}
{"text":"I like this place.. after eating terrible \"texmex\" to the point that we don't usually eat Mexican food, this is way more legit. I really have enjoyed everything I have ordered. There were 2xs my husband found the food too salty which is a shock as he is a salt lover. But since then things have been great. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Under new ownership! Love it and the food along with a bigger space to sit and dine!!! Extended hours is a huge deal!!!!! Great burritos enchiladas style!!!!"}
{"text":"Wanted a bean and cheese burrito like nobody's business. 
Walked in ordered it and waited about 5 min. 
You think you couldn't screw up a bean and cheese burrito, BUT they didn't. It was fantastic. Chips and hot sauce completed my meal. So good. 
Will defiantly be going back to try all the other items. 
Yummy"}
{"text":"Richard, the owner, makes sure he gets to know your name.  We've been eating at all 3 Rito's for years.  Anyone that knows good Mexican food goes out of their way to eat here.  Try the sour cream tacos!"}
{"text":"Who the heck would have thought that there would be such a gem in SURPRISE? Well there is and let me tell you... it's pretty darn fantastic!  I wouldn't really call this place a sit down restaurant because there are only 4 tables but the food is worth the fight to sit. You walk in and wonder where you order food (very back on the left side). The staff was extremely pleasant and the food was crazy good. Not only was the food good but it was presented nicely. Although the staff wasn't too friendly they were extremely professional. 

The bean and cheese burrito is amazing... especially enchilada style. The beans are incredible and taste straight from Mexico. This place was a great surprise and happens to be in Surprise!! Ha joke. 

You MUST try this place"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp earlier today and decided we would try out something new for the wife and I. Menu is pretty simple (thats not a bad thing at all). Wife was a tad disappointed they didn't have any chicken enchiladas on the menu so she settled for the green chili beef. I decided to go with the green chili beef burrito enchilada style with a side of beans. We got our order to go since we had our 1 year old with us. While we waited we talked to a real nice gentleman who after a few mins we learned he was the owner of this location. Real nice guy. Wait wasnt as bad as we thought and soon we had our food and heading home. My wife wasnt a huge fan of her enchilada (but then again she is pregnant!). Me on the other hand, I was pretty happy with my burrito choice. It was a tad spicy which I didnt mind too much, flavor was great. Only down side for me was the first 3 bites I didn't get any meat...just tortilla and sauce. After that I was into the beef though I think it needed a little more beef filling for the price I paid. Refried beans with my burrito were on point. All in all I give them 4 stars. I would try them again and hope the next time around I end up with a little more beef in my burrito...if so I think i'd bump my rating up to a 4.5-5 star rating."}
{"text":"It's sad. I've been a loyal customer of Rito's Burritos since the Original on Garfield st. Since then I've been excited when they opened a location closer to me, the Orangewood location. When I tried that location it was like I was eating the same quality as the original. 

Now when this location opened, just a little closer to me, I was excited, thinking I'd get fat from visiting too much. That worry was soon solved as I took my first bite into their burros. It's missing a lot. First off, the chile is really thick, although this wouldn't be too bad a thing it's too obvious. It's clearly thickened with flour, because my mouth still feels gritty from eating it. There was so much flour that it was half the flavor of the burro. Second, if that wasn't enough flour for you. The burro is wrapped in a very thick tortilla, unlike their other locations which have a great balance of chile (and thickness), as well as the thickness of their tortillas.

I had high hopes for you guys but you let me down. To those who read this, don't be discouraged about Rito's. Their original and Orangewood locations still deliver the goods."}
{"text":"Authentic cooked to order Mexican food.  Not fast food, but we only waited a few minutes for our order. Primarily a take-out place, with just a little inside seating.

Limited menu, but done well. Rice-Beam burrito enchilada style ($7) had an excellent home made sauce (also served w/cheese and shredded lettuce). Beef tacos w/guacamole ($3.90)terrific taste.

Note hours: Tue-Fri 11 - 6 ; Sat 11 am - 5:00 (Dining Rm closes 30 min before closing)

3/17/2016 Update - go the red chile burrito which was great. Richie is especially friendly and helpful in ordering what we wanted."}
{"text":"I ordered a green-chili beef burrito, a side of rice, and a side of refried beans, all for take out.  I chose this location to try based on all the rave reviews and high marks here on Yelp!  Not sure why all the high-mark reviews exist, actually.

The burrito tasted like Chinese food wrapped in a flour tortilla.  The beef was in cubes and swimming in the green-chili sauce.  It did have flavor, but also no cheese or beans inside.  The wrapped tortilla was basically a water balloon, as another Yelper has mentioned.  Maybe this is authentic from a particular region?  Anyway, not a fan.

Rito's is a small place, best for take-out.  Waiting area is comprised of 3-4 chairs, so it's best to phone your order in and pick it up.

Carry-out is in a sideways paper bag, with the order placed on a thin, paper plate.  Terrible.

Pros: Price/Value, Burrito did have flavor though not impressive or satisfying
Cons: Not my idea of the perfect burrito, or even close for that matter"}
{"text":"Great customers service from the guy at the counter (1st star) plenty of parking and clean enviorment. (2nd star) Green & Red Chili was good (3rd star) price and wait time for the food (-1 star) Variety of meat to choose from (-1 star)  I'm not in to Angus beef, if they would only offer Carne Asada or Chicken, then I would be one happy hombre!"}
{"text":"This was just recommended to me by Nadya at Surprise Mini Storage.
This is the best and Very friendly.
 Fair prices, excellent food.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious folded tacos, enchiladas, and green chile burritos. This is a locally owned and operated family restaurant that is mainly for takeout but has a few small tables for groups of 2-4. I cannot say enough about how nice the owners are! This is a great place to get simple awesome Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I love Rito's...my favorite? The red mixed burro, red beef chili with beans. Delicious! I've had the green, I've had their chimichangas, but the best is the red with beans. Simple, yet perfect portion and flavors. Love it!"}
{"text":"Great place! Food is great quality and taste authentic. Service is great too, very friendly. Will be back for sure and will recommend."}
{"text":"Mmmmm! I started eating here every week, I crave their tacos and cheese enchiladas. Even with all of the Mexican food choices in the Valley, I love Rito's! The salsa is tasty, without being too spicy or bland. Beans and rice are really yummy and flavorful. 

They don't offer chicken or pork, just Angus beef. No combos, just create your own and add rice & beans, the prices are reasonable enough to order what you want. 

This is a small mom and pop business. They are closed Sunday and Monday. They also close at 6pm on the other days. Very clean too!"}
{"text":"Rito's was recommended to me with an advisio that the owner was like Seinfeld's \"Soup Nazi\". Nothing is further from the truth. I found the owner to be pleasant, helpful and solicitous of feedback. I ordered the \"specialty\" of a green chile beef burrito and I had mine jazzed up Enchilada style with red sauce. Simply delicious.

Now Rito's is a little quirky. No pork or chicken dishes, just beef (tender, flavorful beef by the way), no combinations which means everything is ala carte. Since there is limited seating, they do a lot of take out business. I ate in and the food was served in an aluminum take out container. 

If you're looking for atmosphere, try Macayo's or the Rio Mirage Cafe. If you're looking for good, fresh Mexican food, give Rito's a try. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good Y'all. Tried Ritos today. Hardy portions if you are really hungry. Yes, their green chilie is good. Tiny place so you might like to take it to go. 
People that work there are very friendly which is why I am their newest fan. I will become a regular."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Surprise! Best beans and rice I've ever had! Owners are very personable and nice. Will always be a loyal customer ;)"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food. Consistently great. There are many Mexican food places in AZ, but not really any that are great. This place is small and doesn't have a huge menu, but what they do serve is really great. We also love the downtown Rito's too, but this is closer. They both are super yummy and always nice employees."}
{"text":"Rito's. What can I say about Rito's? One word comes to mind...fantastic! They have a simple and streamlined menu, just beef and beans as the protein options. But what they do, they do it right! The beans are the best in the valley. Smooth, creamy and just a touch salty. Just how I like them. The burritos are huge! The people there are so nice, friendly and courteous. This hidden gen is worth checking out. If you like good, simple and we'll prepared Mexican food that is served with love, check out Rito's. Trust me. :)"}
{"text":"Delicious flavorful food. They are known for their green chile burritos and reviews don't lie! Small dining room with a few tables and a small menu. It's all done right. Everything here tastes great. This is our regular place when we're craving real Mexican food. The only downside is they are closed Sunday and Monday and they close at 6PM."}
{"text":"Cleanest burrito shop in the valley!!! Truly a mom and pop operation.  Richie and his wife are awesome!  If you are hungry, ask for the firehouse 302 special.  Rice, beans, green, and cheese.  It's not on the menu... yet. :)  Thanks Richie... we'll see you soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  More cost than fast food but you get what you pay for.  Best Mexican cuisine in the West Valley I can find.  Portions are large.   The burrito enchilada style could probably feed 2.  It is small (15 chairs) so take home is probably best.  Get the green chili... it is sweet and spicy and worth every bite."}
{"text":"Walked in restaurant and noticed they didn't serve beer. Used restroom and started to leave and was berated by the owner for deciding not to eat there. 

Friendly staff is a joke. Eeek. I hope they have a better day though, definitely plan to put them on my prayer list"}
{"text":"Well you can't give a better than 1 star review if you never step foot in the door. Yesterday was the 3rd time I've headed over to Ritos in Surprise for lunch and all three occasions they were closed, despite the sign on the door stating they opened at 11am. Not sure what is happening with this place but I won't attempt it again."}
{"text":"Very good food! The perfect mom and pop place to eat! Hidden gem worth visiting over and over again!!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! We stopped in around 12:00 for lunch and the food mixed with excellent service made this top notch!! 

First of all, Richie was so incredibly nice and friendly and really went out of his way to make sure we had a good experience. Some of the best service I have ever received! 

As far as food goes, it was just as good! We had chips and salsa which were great. I had the taco salad and I really liked it! It was large and really filling, more like a bowl than a salad. It came with beef and beans, cheese, lettuce, sour cream and guacamole, in a tortilla bowl! I got it with the green chili sauce and it was very flavorful and the perfect amount of spice! 

My brother got the beef and guacamole tacos, and he thought they were great! He loved the guacamole and the tacos were super filling and had great flavor. 

My dad got the burrito enchilada style with the green chili sauce and he said it was delicious! 

Overall this is a great Mexican place in Surprise! The food and service were both incredible and made for a delicious and great experience! 

The prices were very reasonable and you definitely get your money's worth! I fully recommend this place!"}
{"text":"What a great place for a green chili burrito.   Nice amount of heat and meat. Be careful it comes out hot. The tacos are great. Deep fried shell goodness. 
Also bring CASH ONLY note hours 11-6 Mon-Fri and Sat 10-5. Sunday and Monday closed.  
If your driving on Reems just remember it is in the same shopping center as Church's Chicken.
This is my new fresh taco place and green chili burritos. Tacos come in at 3 bucks and the burritos are from 3.45 to 5.85. 

Try it out you will be thanking me later. Enjoy"}
{"text":"We watched a baseball game out at the Surprise Rec complex and found this place through Yelp. They had such great reviews we decided to head there even though it was 30 minutes before close. Their dining room was already \"closed\" but still packed when we walked in. The man behind the counter informed us that it would need to be take out. But we live 45 mins away...We almost left but the man turned out to be the owner Richard and he let us stay and eat. And boy was it good! We had tostadas, burros and a chimi. The green chili was so good. I tore apart my chimi to get the delicious cubes of meat. And the portions were really big. We learned that this is the brother of Rito's downtown. Also an excellent restaurant. Good recipes travel well in this family! If you're out in Surprise, don't miss this place! But get there before 6!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Worth the wait.  Wish they were open to feed our breakfast burrito cravings."}
{"text":"The food her awesome!!!! Great food paired with great customer service! I can't say enough about this place, the inside of the restaurant is ver clean as well as the kitchen.
Great place to eat, they remember my name and my sons name every time I come in."}
{"text":"Small place but excellent service. The owners and granddaughter chatted with me and you could tell that they are passionate about their food and making their customers happy. I ordered the red chili beef chimichanga in enchilada sauce and it was delicious. The food is made to order and is fresh. The salsa was perfect and the side of rice was the best I've had from a restaurant. It was my first time here and I will definitely frequent Rito's from now on. Can't believe I didn't come here before."}
{"text":"This place was a huge disappointment to say the least.  Ordered the machaca burrito plate which came with rice and beans.  Everything was very bland.  The machaca was mushy (not even sure how you get it that way).  Made me wonder if it was frozen then microwaved or something.  Needless to say I won't be back"}
{"text":"I grew up near the original location, so I had to try this place out! Had bean burro and tostadas to share with children.  My child, who is a picky eater, loved them! Best bean burro in town! The family is the ones cooking and helping you, so they take make the effort to make your experience a good one. Try it and you won't be sorry!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, best lunch spot! It is probably the closest thing i have found to good homemade Mexican food. My favorite would be their green and bean burro mix! It has delicious mild green chili and juicy tender meat inside.

It seems like a lot of reviewers don't like how runny the burritos can get. Which they can be but it doesn't take away from the deliciousness. Just save the extra juices for your rice or get a side of chips to scoop up that gooey goodness."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite burrito spot in Arizona.  The ownership is awesome, and they remember our names every time we go in. My wife and I love ordering green chili burritos with green sauce, the food was hot and made fresh .  Last time I was in, Richie said \"if you want gristle and fat in your burrito go to filibertos!\"  What an awesome guy"}
{"text":"Really good food!  They only serve beef, but they do beef really well.  We had the tacos with chips and beans (real beans).  Great price as well."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Great flavor! We had the green/red chili burrito - so Yummy! Richie was so accomodating and friendly! Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"The excellent green chili burro that I've known for years from their downtown location, but with indoor seating and plenty of parking.  

High quality Mexican food served on disposable plates. 

They need to post the menu on the wall and get the soda machine fixed. 

Still a great lunch."}
{"text":"I've been here several times since I found it in November. Their guac tacos, red chile and green chile burritos are great. Owner is nice and friendly. The place is clean and price is very reasonable. I will be a regular customer."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our food from Rito's. We both ordered green chile burritos (regular style). They ran out of red chile before 4pm which is why I docked a star - I really wanted to try the red chile. Maybe next time! The rice and beans are astounding - probably the best I've ever had. The owner is very nice and helpful. I would recommend taking the food to go as the restaurant is on the smaller side."}
{"text":"Was not impressed. They don't have chicken, only beef and it was quite dry. The sauces were a little too spicy and needed salt. I asked for both red and green sauce on my enchiladas and the guy has to check if that was ok. Hmmmmm, you'd think that wasn't too difficult."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food, didn't wait to order. This is a takeout restaurant with a few tables. Absolutely no atmosphere. Menu was a single sheet of paper with a matrix style grid with food down side a style across top, and prices in middle. I think, never was sure how it was meant to work. Anyway If your looking for a sit down restaurant with atmosphere this isn't it"}
{"text":"OMG finally a GREAT TACO in Surprise Richie is AMAZING and I'm happy to give them my business"}
{"text":"Their bean and cheese burros are amazing! Haven't tried anything else because their bean burros are so good. Everyone that has come with me says the green burros are awesome too. 
The gentleman who works the counter is always friendly and funny."}
{"text":"Highly and when I say highly I mean the highest of highly impressed with this business. The food is absolutely positively amazing. Would recommend this place to everyone I know !"}
{"text":"I don't give five stars, but a 4.5 would be appropriate. I got the green chili beef chimichanga enchilada style covered in red sauce. The two sauces together were perfect, the beef was tender and juicy, the most interesting component was the green chili beef. This hatch chili sauce won't be found in a squeeze bottle in any restaurant. It was creamy, almost like a gravy, but it was a perfect balance of spice and flavor. Oh, and the owner took our orders and talked to us during our meal. Major plus! And as always, I ordered a Mexican Coca to top off the meal."}
{"text":"So delicious! Visiting from Seattle we were craving really good Mexican food and this place hit the nail on the head. We ordered beef tacos and all kinds of enchiladas. We were only in town for 5 nights and we ate here twice. It was that good! The intricate layers of spices in their enchilada sauce totally floored me and their sides could stand on their own. I've often found that the sides in Mexican joints can often be an afterthought, but not here (especially the rice). So good!  We're used to paying Seattle prices for food so were shocked that we fed a family of 5 for $40. While my Mexican food education is small I was delighted by the quality of our meal and am excited to go back when we visit again! Any chance we could get you guys to open a sister restaurant in Bellevue, WA? You guys would be raking it in up here. Just sayin...."}
{"text":"Not the best! Paid $20 for 4 tacos and a small rice and beans! Rice and beans were bland and missing flavor! When I walked in there were 2 girls with gloves sorting through the dry peppers 1 of the girls proceeded to take my order along with my cash and back to peppers with same gloves! Should of walked out! Not worth it!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I have had since ad the bean and cheese burrito and a cheese tostada.  Sooooo good.  Salsa was fresh and tasty.  Everything was hot and tasty.  We have now found our favorite Mexican restaurant.  Plus the owner was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"good food, but in a taco truck kind of way.. mostly single dishes served in foil bowls with plastic utensils..no cups for ice or water..probably won't return"}
{"text":"Excellent food, the service is excellent,  mmmmmm delicious try the chimichangas red or green ridiculously good & this place is very clean A+. Will be back here for sure they cook everything fresh so dont mind waiting a bit :-)"}
{"text":"Not only is Ritos' the best place in Surprise to eat it is the best Mexican food in the Valley.  The shredded beef tacos and the bean burrito are the best ever!! We love Ritchie and the whole family. Thank you for doing what you do!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Clean, well-run and family friendly. The owner checked on us and the other patrons more than once. We will return!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant. Everything is good, but they have great tacos and the best green chili I have ever had. The owners are very friendly, also. I just wish they were open one hour later, so I could go more often. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Green Chili burro, enchilada style (red) and a taco. Just as good as:
A. Their downtown location, which is:
B. Just as tasty as I remember in '79. 

Shit hot guys."}
{"text":"We really liked the food here! It would have been 5 stars but I felt that the consistency of the beans was not right for a bean burrito. They were quite thin and made a mess everywhere so my kids couldn't eat it. Otherwise the taste was perfect. The quesadilla was delicious, good choice of cheese and our carne asada burrito was great."}
{"text":"I have never had bad Mexican food in my life until I tried this place. High prices and few menu choices on top of that. Never again"}
{"text":"This was our 1st visit to Rito's and it's the best authentic Mexican food we have had in a long time. Highly recommend this place, try it you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food! Order anything as you can't go wrong.
We came across town to go to a Rockies at Rangers game and had read that Rito's would be a good choice and it is."}
{"text":"One of the BEST taco salads I've ever had! Good food, super clean and SO friendly. Not the cheapest place in town but SO worth it."}
{"text":"So excited Ritos has come to the west side!
The best in town in traditional Mexican food. You can't beat this family owned spot.

The hot sauce has a great flavor and spice. I could eat their green burrito everyday!"}
{"text":"One of our first visits to a restaurant in Surprise. Great food and wonderful people. The owner is a delight and really seems to appreciate his customers. It sure wasn't my last visit there."}
{"text":"Richie and Hellen are two of the friendliest owners I've met! They are so personable and then there is the food! Wow! The green Chile beef is DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time today. They don't stray from the menu. But there's a good reason for that. The food is absolutely delicious and the staff is extremely friendly. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The green chili is good to runny for my liking but flavor is good. I'm giving 3 stars because it's really pricey I wasn't expecting to pay $14 dollars and change for a burrito chips and drink. there's no lunch specials I'll keep going back because it is tasty but with that price I'd have to be really craving it. I hope this does not offend the owners but if you had a decent lunch special that incl everything you'd see me every week."}
{"text":"BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN ARIZONA! My grandfather took me to the Roosevelt location many years ago and I was instantly hooked. I've been to all 3 Rito's locations and this one is the best by far, mainly bc of the excellent customer service. All Rito's food is outstanding, but I will drive the extra 30 minutes for the ambience and kindness of the Surprise location. My faves are the red chile burro & guacamole tacos, but the beans are delish as well.  I haven't had anything I didn't like.  This location also takes  Visa or MasterCard, whereas the 51st Ave location takes cash only.  If you love good, authentic Mexican food, then Rito's is your place."}
{"text":"Absolutely recommend Rito's to anyone.    The food is great and the family owned friendly atmosphere is really what keeps us coming back.    We will keep coming back for years to come.  

My personal favorite is the red chili burrito enchilada style and my wife always orders the bean burrito enchilada style.  You can't really go wrong with any choice."}
{"text":"Rito's is my favorite place in Surprise to eat authentic Mexican food. While the menu is simple, the red chili burro is by far my favorite thing on their menu. In fact everything I've eaten here is delicious. It's worth the $$$."}
{"text":"Best ever made from scratch Mexican food on the planet!!! My in laws have been coming here since Rito's opened in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"Service has slowed down A LOT! When it takes 30 minutes to get the food ordered on two different occasions is unacceptable.  Especially when there are 4 people in the kitchen supposedly cooking.  I witnessed an elderly couple ask for their money back because they had been waiting for over 30 minutes as i was too.  Also, when taking a \"in person\" order being a foot away from the person taking the order. \"side of beans\" 
what does she enter in? \"side of rice\". Service is what keeps bringing customers back or keeping them away.  Rito's is currently on Strike 2 with me. my next visit may be my last if it continues!!!!"}
{"text":"We might try it again (some day) based solely on the overwhelming force and persuasion of Yelp. Now based on our isolated experience, wtf was that on our plates? We did not order WTF. I did not want a room temp tortilla pulled from a plastic bag and filled with my choice of green or red goo. 

I thought I was being punk'd until I realized I'm not a very well-known celebrity in these parts. I am big in Europe and Asia, but Ashton doesn't care about Eurasia. And he'd never come to Surprise either. So, I was 86-90% sure that AK wasn't about to jump out. 

This. was. apparently. real. life. 

And real life was actually quite terrible in that moment. But don't listen to me. Listen to the 444 other reviewers praising Rito's food. Statistically your experience will be more closely aligned with \"their\" perceptions than ours. 

Good luck."}
{"text":"Best mexican food in Surprise. We love the burritos and Taco Salad. Richie and Helen are friendly and always remember our names."}
{"text":"I've had the tacos, enchiladas and a couple of different burritos. Everything has tasted wonderful so far and I love the sauce that they use for the enchiladas. The staff here is also really nice and always friendly!"}
