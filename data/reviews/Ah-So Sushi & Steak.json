{"text":"Worst service ever. We ordered drinks and a appetizer after 30 minutes of waiting and watching our waitress chatting it up with the rest of the staff i approached her turns out she never ordered them. We had the manager come over and she did exactly what you would expect at a place like this  NOTHING. The waitress showed up with the drinks right after we spoke to the manager we finished them quickly payed full price for them and then left to go actually have dinner somewhere else. Don't waist your time there better sushi places with better service in the area"}
{"text":"We love this place. Love all 3 cooks. Eddie, Joe and Enrique. It for us. gets no better"}
{"text":"I came to Ah So for a friend's birthday. The cooks were awesome and really put on a good show. The food was decent, but a bit over priced. However, the service and show made up for the higher cost."}
{"text":"One of worst cook at food table Experience I've had. Food expensive and not good . Cook didn't know how to season it  either. Soup & salad fair at best
waste of money. Don't go here!"}
{"text":"The manager here is very unprofessional which shows with this subpar restaurant. The food is OK at best-definitely not worth the price. The service is horrendous and don't plan on being tended to right away. I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone and encourage everyone to take their business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I cant even say Ive been here. I bought a voucher from restaurants.com then called to see if reservations were needed. The lady over the phone advised they arent honoring the vouchers. Considering is was about 75 bucks thats a little frustrating. So with time I spoke with co workers about this. Ive been advised by mulitple people I was lucky not to go here. Roaches in bath room. One person told me there was one roach at her table. Ive been advised to check out orginal location Bell/59th. The one off 75th. I hear all negitive things about. If u want good Sushi. Go to the smaller cleaner location on Bell/59th Ive been told.

{"text":"I am a huge fan of Ah-So! Their Tepan experience is great! The fillet, the shell fish, calamari, scallops, etc are all very tasty.  The few sushi entrees that we have tried have been very tasty and fresh. We have also tried the gyoza and it is very good as well for an appetizer. The mixed drinks are so so. I would recommend getting a Japanese beer. We have always had great service and friendly cooks and wait staff."}
{"text":"I have visited almost all the ah-so restaurants in the valley and have never been dissappinted and today I went to try this location for the first time and was told I had to wait about 45 minutes wish is not a big deal but when I asked to sit at the cooking table the hostess told me she could not do that and could only sit me at a regular table I guess its easier to incovennience the customer rather than sit him at the cooking table where I was going to order sushi and drinks while I waited for the cooking table to fill up. Either the hostess is not properly trained or if this are the management rules than there is something wrong because as a customer I dont see the need to inconvenience me in moving me from one table to another while I wait. I went and ate across the street at Oreganos and it was full, it must be because they treat their customers the way a customer should be treated."}
{"text":"With a reservation had to wait over an hour for chef...waitress didn't refill drinks and sushi was not good.  But the good news is that he meal was over priced."}
{"text":"The reason I did not give it a 5 is because the hostess was not attentive, she took 5 minutes to greet us, had us wait 10 minutes but then sat us down AFTER another couple walked in, which they were seated immediately. 

It got better, our server was very attentive and the cook was funny and entertaining. The food was delicious. It was served in a weird way, usually they give you veggies then rice then your main course. This guys gave us rice, half of the main course (depending on what was still cooking) then veggies at the end so they were kind of soggy.

I really suggest they get new hostesses since they were not willing to greet us and had us sit for 10 minutes then seat someone who walked in after us."}
{"text":"Bad bad bad experience. We ordered takeout. Multiple issues:
1 can't order children's menu over the phone. Fine, no big deal. 
2 wrong order given to us. Didn't realize until my husband got all the way home. Mistakes happen. 
3 return to ah-so after calling. Given lukewarm order with no offer to make fresh or make up for THEIR mistake. Getting annoyed.
4 we are now sick to our stomach. 

Never again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Got a to-go order. Food was amazing! Staff was attentive and courteous. Prices were high for what you get and location. 

I was very pleased with the selection of specialty rolls and entrees."}
{"text":"You know how sometimes you have experiences that are so bad you just \"can't\" ...that pretty much sums it up. To summarize, it started out with calling in for pickup and when I arrived the hostess told me they don't make one of the rolls I requested. She had my number but didn't bother to call back....then after waiting for 15 mins for the roll I ordered in person, I got home and saw they got the roll wrong and overcharged me for the one they gave me. Got my money back 2 weeks later when I had to return so the manager could write me a personal check. There was a lot more to it but that gets the point across. Not sure how good the food was...it was cold after waiting there for another one..."}
{"text":"Upperscale decor. Good cocktails and some of the best sushi I've ever had. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I will make this short. I love sushi and this was the worst, most flavorless sushi I have ever had. I guess I have been spoiled by Hana's Japanese Eatery and the freshness and quality there. I did enjoy the cocktail which was called the Ahsosuki."}
{"text":"Not sure why the mediocre ratings for this restaurant.  We went for a family birthday and had a great time!  It's standard teppan-yaki similar to Benihana, not sure what people expect.  The food was very fresh which you could tell from the raw chopped ingredients, plentiful, and the chef was fun and entertaining.  Good bar selection, too.  I would recommend a reservation because the teppan-yaki tables fill up fast.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went today with my manager and team from work. Had great food, service, and fun. Great day today at Ah-So Happy Valley"}
{"text":"Love eating sushi here. I come buy on lunch break or for dinner with my family and dont have any complaints. their happy hour is great and their service is good too."}
{"text":"I have been to all the Ah-So Sushi locations and this is by far the best one! Go to Mr. Kim and ask for a Mr. Kim #4. Best susji I've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Had supper tonight, shrimp entree and steak entree were both very good and not salty. The California roll was wonderful.  The biggest thing that concerned me was the cleanliness.  I would rate a 2.  No matter how good the food is I still expect what I see too be somewhat taken care of, example of what I observed, bathroom mirror was extremely dirty and counter had not been wiped down, our table had been hastily wiped down as it was sticky in spots and finally the biggest issue was looking up at the overhead lights, all 3 within my sight, each had a significant amount of dead bugs. I would give them another try and hope things would be taken care of."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill. I'm here now been waiting 45 min for my food I'm also with my 3 year old and if your a parent you know it's hard to keep them calm that long. Food is just not right I really prefer the ahso on 60 and bell. Last time I ever come here."}
{"text":"food sucked, Hot food cold, sushi was not that great. Service was totally horrible. basically a sports bar,  I have been here 3 times, the last time, we just ordered shushi to go, which was totally underheard of, based on how the servers acted.  Seems like a ton of middle school girls work here, girls at front dest sat me down in waiting area, but then not 5 minutes later, asked why I was sitting there.. I went to pay for food at the bar, because it was to go, but then asked to leave a tip?... I didnt. 

The AHSO I would go to is on bell and roughly 62nd Ave.. They great you with a smile, food is amazing, sushi is the best, excellent atmosphere."}
{"text":"Eh...it's OK.  Sushi is slow to arrive and sometimes doesn't come out until after the main meal has arrived. We went last night, the place was packed so we sat in the regular dining room and not at the teppanyaki table.  Service was spotty, the food was cold, California roll took more than 30 minutes to arrive and it looked like a 5-year-old made it; it barely stayed together.  This place used to be great, but it's slowly going downhill."}
{"text":"We arrived at the restaurant at 8:45 on a Thursday evening and were told by the hostess that teppanyaki was closed. I asked why and all the hostess would say is that the manager told her that it was closed. I asked to speak to the manager because the restaurant hours said open until 10 and we were willing to wait if we needed to. The manager, Daniel, arrived a few minutes later and repeated the same thing that teppanyaki was closed. I asked why and very rudely he said all the tables were full. I asked if they all just sat down or if there was one that would be done soon because we were willing to wait for a table. He got all flustered and angry and walked away. Daniel made the hostess then come tell us it would be about a 40 minute wait. Being in the restaurant management business, I was shocked at how Daniel treated customers and his staff on top of how much business he lost that night by directing the hostess to tell people teppanyaki was closed at 8:45 pm. People will wait for that service and there were more parties behind us that would have waited also but decided to leave."}
{"text":"Tried this location expecting it to be like the Happy Valley location. Our cook was boring and just stood there making chicken noises and served us food that was not nearly as good as the other location. I guess I know now why the chicken crossed the road, to get away from this awkward weirdo"}
{"text":"Teppanyaki is great, dining food is not nearly as good and by not as good i mean bad so stick to the teppanyaki tables. Our family usually requests Chef David, we have had other chefs that are good but he has been our favorite anywhere we have went. Service could be better, wait staff spends too much time socializing with each other rather than asking whether I would like another Kirin. Oh well that's why the Chef got a fat tip for his jar and the sever gots a standard 18% and not a penny more. Despite the listed service issue, still the best restaurant of its type and light years better than Benihana. One more tip, go at night, it's a bit pricier but the portions are bigger and the morning show isn't as good."}
{"text":"In Phoenix on business.  Saw the reviews but figured I'd give it a go anyway.  Grabbed 2 rolls to go so I could go back to my hotel room and work.  I ordered the rainbow roll and the philly roll (asked to have cucumber added).  What I got was some sort of roll stuffed with \"crab\" with something cooked ( fish or eel) on top.   Everywhere I've been the rainbow has raw fish on top.  Philly was okay, i've had better from Whole Foods' sushi counter.  Pretty disappointing overall."}
{"text":"Went in last Sunday for dinner with my family. We sat at the teppanyaki grills for a birthday and were promptly greeted by our waitress, Andrea (who was awesome by the way). The food was pretty good, kind of expensive, but worth it. Overall it was a great and fun experience and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly staff, relaxed but nice atmosphere.  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"in a telegraph style, my last visit to ah-so was:
very disappointing
impossible to find a parking spot
the hostess was rude
we did have a reservation, yet they made us wait 35 minutes
the tepanyaki chef was not good at cooking at all, my rice was crunchy, the rare steak i ordered was beyond well done
Ah-so is now Ah-dont-think-so to me."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to come as a family. & usually always have a great experience. But today!!!!! The wait was too long and everyone seem to be running lost. But, very good place and great for family dinners."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this restaurant with our two daughters. This was their first teppanyaki experience. Needless to say, it left much to be desired. The whole experience was lacking. The food was average. The chef was non-engaging. It was obvious that he had one or two life ambitions... a) stand up comedian or B) sportscaster. His only interaction with our table was with the only person to respond to his sports related questions. The usual teppanyaki experience didn't happen. Cook a little, talk sports.

He did take the time to play catch... Whether his guests wanted to or not. When children shied away, he threw food anyway. Several folks at our table said no to his game, to no avail. My daughter who did not want to play got hit in the head with a large piece of broccoli.

For the price, and lack of a quality experience... Go somewhere else. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just plain AWFUL. My significant other and I received TERRIBLE service, the waitress literally acted as if we were an inconvenience to her, I'm sorry, but if you don't like you're job you have two choices: 1) Quit, or 2) you need to suck it up, put a smile on and at least pretend you care, since I'm sure you're being paid for your labor. Not only was she non-attendant; didn't ask once if we needed refills -- I had to eat the ice in my glass to maintain some moisture in my mouth from the dry food, but here's the kicker, she also overcharged us and SHE GOT AN ATTITUDE about it, we corrected her and she insisted the Tuna Tar Tar was not on the happy hour menu, we put the menu in her face and she became speechless, she didn't even have the decency to apologize and got an attitude about adjusting HER mistake!!!  I don't know if its company policy to over charge customers by luring them in for a Happy Hour special and then when they catch it, cop an attitude and try to guilt them into paying full price or what, but that's just down right BAD business and unethical. Will NEVER step foot in this place ever again!!!! So disappointing."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS!!!  It wouldn't post unless I picked at least one star. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!  Went there for our grandson's birthday. We usually go the Peoria location but decided to try the Avondale location since it's so much closer to home. BIG MISTAKE!!  We tried to make a reservation earlier in the day and were told that they don't take reservations. But when we arrived, we were told that we couldn't sit at the teppanyaki tables because they were reserved!!  So we sat at the other tables but the entire time we were there, no one sat at the teppanyaki tables!!! So they were empty, but not available to us!  And even though it's the same restaurant as the one in Peoria, there is a HUGE difference in the quality and the taste of the food. I ordered the filet and shrimp and the filet was tougher that any steak I have ever had. The shrimp was overcooked and had the consistency of rubber. My husband and I asked for a separate check so that my daughter didn't have to pay for our meal yet when we got our bill, the waitress still added the automatic gratuity that is normally added for parties larger than 6. When we argued that we were a party of 2, she said that it didn't matter because
 she had already charged our card and she wasn't going to change it. What kind of service is THAT??  They will never see us again in that place."}
{"text":"Very sloooow service for a reservation for a party of 20! Only one waitress for too many tables. Will not be going back. :("}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place for happy hour!  Bartender Helen is the best!  She has always taken great care of us.  Doesn't matter if its just my husband and me or a group of friends!  Sushi is great as well!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is only three stars! I've been going here since they've opened but haven't been back since I moved back to Goodyear! The place looks amazing! Service was very on point! Upon arrival for my togo, the manager or whoever he is immediately asked if I wanted a drink, water Coke products etc free of charge! I declined but I loved that gesture. The place was pretty crowded that Friday night. Anyway, I ordered the beef fried rice togo! Huge portion for only 10 dollars also came with a soup! Love it !!! Keep up the great work and management! Hope to see this place busy all the time!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a horrible experience we just had here. We came for sushi and a kids dinner for my daughter on the night of my birthday. We have been here once before for tepanyaki, so I ignored the bad reviews on here for sushi. DONT. First of all, the yellowtail \"sashimi\" looked like it was butchered with a serrated knife from someone who has never made sashimi before. It was the thickest, most awkwardly cut pieces and completely inedible. I had to order shishito peppers TWICE and she must have put a rush on them or something because they were practically raw and had absolutely no flavor. Even the soup you get as an appetizer had zero flavor. My daughters entree came out and it was cold. That was the final straw. If we don't get a food borne illness from the little we ate, I will be surprised."}
{"text":"Nice place if you like sushi. Not many options for others. If you are not a sushi lover then this is not a place to consider and looks to be lilttle pricy."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and people.  Interior is redone and looks great.  All the Teppan chefs are on point.  The sushi is bar is good also.  Friday and Saturday is real busy.  Try going on weekday.  Its a good place to grab a beer and a bite after work."}
{"text":"This place has severely gone down hill. Servers very slow and seem irritated. We used to go all the time but now it's disgusting. The sushi is warm and the shrimp instantaneously made me sick.  Let's not point out a couple of months ago they had a B rating which is not good.  We are never going there again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed at this sushi restaurant. Went with a few friends and to celebrate my friends bday. Let's just say nothing went well. First we go in and theres a 45 minute wait. Manager personally came up to us and said 15 minutes but ended up being 45. The manager should of just been honest so we went elsewhere. Next up the bathroom smells gross. Smells like something rotten is there. There is food everywhere on the ground. If I'm paying about $30 a plate for a person I'm expecting clean floors and a nice smell to the restaurant. Our server was great! I do notice they do work hard for there money. Most servers are running around most of the time. Bussers are also cleaning tables in a fast matter. I spoke to the manager because our food came out cold. He did nothing. Did not care at all. Said basically \"oh well\". As a manager I don't expect nothing for free but expected sometime of a discount but they could care less. I do not know his name but it was a guy. Next up the sushi was frozen and they did not have uni. Was upset about that. I just wanted to have a good time with my friends but nothing went planned. The air was hot also. Not sure why it was so high but it felt like I was sweating. I would never recommend this place to anyone. Stay away! Food is not worth it, and very oily or frozen/cold. Not worth going and will never see me at this location. Very rude management"}
{"text":"Second BAD experience here so I had to write something.  First time I came here on a Saturday in June because they had live music.  The Norterra website stated that they had $2 Domestic drafts.  When we got there the manager said that the Happy Hour prices were $3 for the beers, I asked him multiple times if he wanted to see my iPhone where I had the website brought up, he told me no and he would take care of us.  When the check came, go figure they were $3 and the manager Don was nowhere to be found.  So yesterday I decided to try this place again with 3 other people.  We order our drinks, get a couple spicy tuna rolls for an appetizer, some yakisoba noodles from the kitchen and 2 Sashimi platters.  15 minutes after our order was put in the same manager's family comes in and sits next to us.  The Yakisoba noodles come out with our \"Appetizer\".  We wait another 15-20 minutes still no sign of our waitress, our drinks have been empty and no Sashimi platters, we catch the bartender walking around who was nice enough to bring us some more drinks, and notice the same manager from before, Don bringing two Sashimi platters to his family next to us!  When we call him over to complain he tries to throw the waitress under the bus, even though we saw her put in the order.  We asked for our check and paid for what we ate/drank and Don was as, he put it \"Nice Enough\" to take off the Sashimi platters that we never got (Like I'm paying for food we didn't get??!!).  Until they can find a new manager I will not be back to visit this place!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday with family and had a great time.  We sat at the grill where they cook all the food in front of you.  They were very helpful and accommodating to me since I have a shellfish allergy.  Fun time!"}
{"text":"I love this place, sushi is on point. Yakisoba is great! I would have given five stars if they offered more choices for children. Our server forgot our salads too but she was new so I will forgive her. My husband and I come here at least once a month and the food is always good."}
{"text":"Absolute worst service I have ever experienced at a restaurant.  I setup a reservation for 11 a week in advance for Teppanyaki to celebrate my fiancee's 30th birthday on Saturday April 22.  The reservation was setup for 7:30PM and I told them it was for a birthday and they advised of their $7 birthday celebration which is supposed to be ice cream.  I had also scheduled an event for after dinner starting at 9:45 thinking that 2 hours would be plenty of time for dinner as the event was just down the street.

We arrived and had 10 of us there at the time of the reservation but they refused to seat us because all of us were not there.  I can understand that as being procedure for a restaurant, however this was never communicated to me by the hostess when I made the reservation nor was it communicated when they called to confirm the reservation earlier that day.

So about 20 minutes later, our final guest arrived and we were seated at 7:55 once they got the table setup.  About 10-15 minutes went by before anyone came around to ask us for drinks.  At that time also, the table next to us was seated and were asked for their drinks right away.  We received our drinks and roughly 10 minutes later, the server came around again to take our food order and asked for refills which we did, and we never saw her again.  At this point, it was past 8:30 and not only had we not received our refills but then we watched as the teppanyaki chef showed up at the table NEXT to us who had been seated AFTER we were.  Another 5-10 minutes went by and our chef finally showed up and to his credit, he was fantastic but the attitude of our group at this point was poor as we still hadn't even received our drink refills yet.

We had food on our plates around 9 or so and then finally the server came around and asked us for refills and we asked what happened to the previous refills and she said that she forgot because it was busy.  We did receive those refills and I immediately asked for the checks as it was past 9:15 and we needed to get on our way to the event.  So despite me advising that it was her 30th birthday, we never received any form of dessert or birthday celebration.  We received the checks (split checks) and 18% gratuity had been added for everyone.  At this point it was 9:30 so we had to rush out of there to get to our next event but I couldn't believe at how awful the overall service was and that not only was gratuity included, but nothing on any of our meals were comp'd.  The manager was apologetic about the situation but I will NEVER return to this location and will be following up with the General Manager of the location or whoever I need to get in contact with to further express my displeasure.  This was absolutely unacceptable for the amount of money this place charges."}
{"text":"I must say how impressed we were by the attention we got from our server Kim she was probably one of the nicest girls ever and helped us with all of our questions. The food was delicious and the sushi that we got was good also probably could've picked better ones but overall everything was awesome!"}
{"text":"First review ever. I used to serve part time for 4 years, I understand that stuff can happen, but this was horrible. We came for a friends birthday, party of 14. We were sat at the grill and then didn't see anybody again for 20 minutes. A server finally came and took our drink order, 3 beers and 2 mixed drinks and the rest were waters. The waters were brought, however the alcohol took 30 minutes BUT soon as she got to our table with the drinks....she dropped them all.  She apologized and walked away. What appeared to be a Manger, walked swiftly by the table saying the drinks were on their way, he didn't stop, he said it as he walked by, never making eye contact which I thought was so weird. Another 25 minutes had passed and our new drinks arrived and she took our food order. The teppanyaki chefs came a lot quicker than the drinks did, they were in and out. The food was mediocre, everything was bland. The chefs weren't engaging, didn't really seem happy to be there. Could have faked the funk at least. Obviously, the server tacked on the gratuity to everyones bill because of the size of the party which is always annoying when the service is crappy, but I fully understand why restaurants do it. Overall, the wait for everything was ridiculous, they weren't busy enough to have it be that long. The fact that the manager didn't come to the table to address us after the drinks had been dropped to offer an apology or a discount was irresponsible on managements part and bad representation.  I won't be coming here ever again."}
{"text":"This was my second visit because my daughter lives the sushi, and my steak was much better than the first time. 
But my daughter found a hair in her miso soup. The waitress was properly apologetic and said she was going to talk to the manager and give us free dessert.
The manager came over and told us it looked like a cat hair. What the ....?? If rather think it came from a chef than think they have cats in the kitchen!!! She said \"We don't want to bring our pets to work....\" Ummm, are your uniforms that dirty???
She apologized, no free dessert, just \"thanks for being so understanding.\"
Gross.
Update: an hour later my daughter's boyfriend is vomiting. Thanks, Ah-So, cat hair and food poisoning."}
{"text":"I have only eaten here 5 times.  Twice my order was wrong.  Once they fixed it, the other they refused.  All in all the food is average for the genre.  The decor was nice.  The hostess was rude.  The parking is entirely inadequate.  

My last visit was in honor of my daughter's 17th birthday; we came at her request for lunch.  Though I mentioned to the hostess that this was for a birthday nothing was done by the staff to commerate it. 

 Yes, it was wrong of me to expect something, but hey, even a little scoop of ice cream and a song would have been nice.

The server was excellent and the hibachi chef was entertaining.  My daughter loved her tempura and all in all she had a memorable meal.

Because it was lunch time in the middle of the week the parking was easy.  Thank goodness.

A bump up of two stars from my last reveiw due to the easy parking and the waiter."}
{"text":"Had a great time. We had a table of 5 and the service was great. Food was delicious. Not over crowded which was great because we like to enjoy our meal and not feel rushed. Not sure if we just got lucky but our chief was very friendly and our server was on top of it. Had a great time. Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing & very flavorful!  I continuously find myself itching to come back!  On top of the food being amazing, the employees are super friendly & make you feel like a part of the Ah So family!  Definitely recommend this place for any dates, family dinners, or special occasions!"}
{"text":"Price is right especially for happy hour beer if that is your thing.  They need to update the routine of the grill cooks, if you come often enough it is the same routine.  They do a good job though.  The gem of this location is Robert the bartender.  He is easily the most welcoming person I have met in a long time.  His smile is addictive."}
{"text":"I know the management here and gotta say the sushi and sashimi is suprisingly good for being in  phoenix, AZ. good portions and cheap price. had the sushi/sashimi combo and the sashimi combo. really fresh and high quailty fish. the rolls here are also very good. place has a college party atmosphere to it with loud club music bumpin and dj playing music."}
{"text":"Me and my wife came back to try AH-SO for the last time because we have gotten horrible service the last two times we have came but I guess in life the third time is the charm our female sever/bartender Jackson was amazing, wonderful personality and a great work ethic she has made our ah-so experience amazing...we will be back just because of you so thank you Jackson A.."}
{"text":"My family and I visited this location tonight because I wanted some sushi.We walk inside and there was no wait,we decided to not sit at one of the grills so they sat us in a corner 1/2 booth 1/2 table....i mean really in the corner totally away from anyone else! I felt like I was being punished or something, I opened the menu and was shocked by the prices,really over $10 for a kids meal? I wanted to get up and leave right away but I didnt....big mistake! Our waitress came over and I couldnt understand a thing she said,I just said iced tea! she came with our drinks and took our order,I ordered the filet mignon(which said it was comparable to kobe beef) and the hubby ordered the \"steak\" ......ok it just said steak nothing else.the kids both ordered the steak as well,we also got a crunchy california roll and a volcano roll.our miso soup came out and was ok but ive had better,the \"salad\" was iceberg lettuce with a half slice of tomato on top...not so good! the rolls came out and I liked mine which was the cali roll but they put a sauce on top which I didnt like,the volcano roll was soooo disgusting! hubby ordered it so im not sure exactly what was in it but it has cooked salmon wrapped around it,I ate one and almost threw up,it took all my strength not to.our food comes out,we all had the same exact food on our plates,\"steak\" mixed veggies,and a mound of fried rice. the steak was cubed and tasteless,I tried both my hubbys steak and mine and couldnt tell the difference,no wonder they give you 2 different sauces....you will need them! The veggies included onions,carrots,broccoli and zucchini there was more seasoning on them than on the \"steak\".The rice was by far the worst thing there,it didnt taste like fried rice and seriously didnt even taste like rice! I dont know what was going on there but whatever! my kids only ate the steak and some veggies they also hated the rice,my husband ate everything after took all of our sauces and pored it onto his plate.the bill came to $110 and I didnt even want to leave a tip but im not that horrible,I couldnt understand anything the waitress said,she hardly came over to our table since all of her other tables were on the other side of the room and she was busy with them most of the time.If I spend $30 for a plate I expect much more than what I got here and will never go back. At least dont cube our steak...I wonder what it looked like before they cooked it! I hope you see this before you try to go here,I made the mistake of not checking yelp before I went and learned my lesson!"}
{"text":"This is our son's favorite restaurant and we treated him recently for his birthday.  We had \"Jessie\" as our chef and he is the best Teppanyaki chef we have ever had!  He was so awesome and entertaining and put on a great show for our kiddo for his birthday.  The food is always awesome here.  If you are looking for awesome Teppanyaki/Hibachi - this is the place in town to go to!!!"}
{"text":"Service was below average, took them 30 minutes to take our order. Rainbow roll was bad so i returned it but the baked roll I ordered instead was even worse. Ordered some gyoza because i was still hungry and thought theres no way to screw up gyoza...well, way. Would never come back to this place."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed!  Went to lunch there with my husband today.  We each ordered a $15 entree from the lunch menu.  When we got our bill, to our surprise we were charged $28 per entree.   When we asked why, we were told that the lunch prices were not available since it was Valentines Day.  That is understandable, but we should have been informed of that BEFORE we ordered!  There were no signs posted (I checked before leaving to make sure we didn't miss any), no menu insert, nothing at all to let us know.  The hostess and server also failed to  inform us of the \"Valentine's Day special\".  We should not have been surprised that our bill was almost double the price we were expecting.  Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"had New York steak they cubed it and fried it in a wok. If i had filet mignon I would have been even more pissed. should have been called beef and vegetables with rice, at half the price."}
{"text":"This location is close to my work which makes it a very convenient place to meet up with coworkers after work. I have never been impressed with this locations service. The first time I went it was during happy hour on a Sunday. Most of the group ordered drinks and sushi which took quite some time to receive. I ordered a ramen which took the longest out of anything to cook. It's noodles and soup so it can't take 30 minutes. Unfortunately my first bite was quite the disappointment when I could tell that the noodles had definitely been over cooked and turned to mush. We asked to speak to the manager but was told she was out sick so there was nothing they could do about our inadequate service. The second time I went here was a Thursday evening. Our waitress seemed incompetent and could not get anyone's order right. Other employees of the restaurant were just standing around or watching the basketball game one. I also overheard inappropriate banter between some of the employees. One of my friends ordered a beer which took 30 minutes for it to finally arrive to the table. It only arrived because I walked directly to the bar to get it from the bartender. At the end of this experience since we waited so long for our food and there were so many mix ups with our meals and checks we requested that our food be happy hour price since we didn't start eating until after happy hour had started. The only good thing about this place is the location."}
{"text":"Ok been coming to this restaurant for years,  and tonight is my husbands birthday.  Wanted to have some Asian food.  The service we received was horrible.  Asked for the alcohol list was told server will bring it. Server comes asked us if we wanted something to drink,  told server,  \"we were told you'd bring it \". We've been here for a half hour just got our drinks and no it is not busy,  not yet anyway.  Keeps wanting our order when we haven't even gotten our appetizers. Brother. .."}
{"text":"I can stop raving about how great the food is, I go at least once a week.. I have no problem the manager  is wonderful the hostess are  all good and the waitresses are very well too. so all the bad reviews that I'm reading must not be the one in Goodyear Arizona.. it can't be
They are very professional in the one  in Goodyear. I recommend anybody going riot you will be impressed."}
{"text":"I've been to this location before but today was a series of unfortunate events and no other than on Fathers Day. I understand there are longer wait times but when you see other parties still being called before you is odd. I was very observant of who was here and and what times they checked in. We were a party of ten for the grill table. We checked in exactly at 7:30pm and got seated at 845-ish. The Chef didn't get to our table until exactly 9:30. Understandable we were last group to be served and every staff member is probably exhausted by the long day, but nevertheless the waitress spilled the platter of waters on my father. His shrimp plate became a shrimp soup. I also Forgot to mention the forks had rice in them when we were seated. Disappointed, not coming here again anymore. :("}
{"text":"I didn't think it was even as good as most of the chains as far as the filet went.
  My wife did like the rainbow roll though.
I would not come back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food is prepared quickly and taste great. Pricing is appropriate and the decor is beautiful."}
{"text":"This place is good.  I tried the steak and scallops and would recommend it. The only downside is the price.  Otherwise a good experience."}
{"text":"I don't venture out of Phoenix that often but this place is hot for Peoria AZ. Reverse happy hour is DIRT cheap, but taste like a 5 star restaurant!   Waitress are attentive never let our group of 15 hang.  I had a drink in hand a gay joke to tell every time.  :)  I had few things on  the happy hour menu, Of course the spicy tuna roll, simple, nice down that, calimari strips, not over cooked just right, maybe a little salty but super good, and I had there spicy chicken wings, which honestly was a little spicy for my taste, even though I like my Sh#^ hot!!!  Each item I orderd was under $5 bucks.  Amazing deal.  Well then you had the drinks which were also on happy hour where incredible cheap...compared to your sister city SCOTTSDALE....  With my food and my 4 drinks I forked out a merely 30 bucks which is nothing......GREAT PLACE TO GO!!!!   BTW awesome di!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hours are supposed to be till 10pm. Walked in and 9:19pm, & waited 3 minutes just to be acknowledged, & then told \"we're actually closed.\""}
{"text":"Not entirely impressed with the scene here but it wasn't too bad. I'll get right to the point. Friendly staff however, the food (Kobe steak) was overlooked and not what I was expecting, small plate. It was tasty but not worth the $27 for the plate. The sushi was mediocre nothing special. Not a place with top shelf alcohol either. Spent $100 and could have been better off going to Panda Express and spent 1/3 of the cost. Will not return."}
{"text":"My first time at this family friendly restaurant was when a friend took me out to dinner for my birthday. The food was quite good and although I didn't pay for it, I thought the prices were reasonable. Our chef was very talented. Service was good and overall it was an enjoyable experience. I would return and do recommend it."}
{"text":"The sushi is great! A little pricey. But worth it. The 7 pc sushi , 7 pc sashimi, with the spicy tuna roll combo is a great combo to get and it's very delicious and very fresh. Another thing to try is the shrimp tempora. AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over a year and the service and food has been impeccable. I sit at the sushi bar and Hiro, Jimmy and Tyler  have given us great suggestions!  This has truly become one of my comfort spots!  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Just great. we organized a birthday party there. 
detailed attention to guests, great service, awesome atmosphere. manager Tony took care of business. 
It was really a pleasent experince. I will recommend this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"Good food, bout what I expected for prices. They did accommodate our party of 17 which was cool. We had our own little room area. Chefs were just OK, no cool tricks."}
{"text":"I've been to a few of the locations and this one's food is excellent and up to par with the others. However  the service is slow, after we were  seated it took 15 minutes for the wait staff to event take our drink order.  They did try and make it up to us by comping some appetizers, but after making us wait to take our drink order, they didn't  get the drinks out right away. Instead they waited till our soups and salads were ready and brought  the drinks with them. Just a bad server. The cook and food we're great. I hope they get the service fixed because it's a bad representation of the whole chain."}
{"text":"I have been here several times now. 90% of the time I am disappointed, but I tend to give several chances to businesses before making a negative review. 

1. Upon entering, I find the hostess always seems to be the nicest. 
2. If you sit in a regular table, some of them are not as clean. Check the dishes too! Heck even sometimes the tenpayaki table is dirty.
3. Sushis are cold. Contrary to popular believe, sushi is supposed to be served with warm fresh rice. Not cold. The Sushis are meh at best. Flavorless. Like I could buy the same thing at Fry's market for much less -_-
4. Hit or miss customer sevice. Several times different servers keep either serving us wrong drinks or totally forget our orders. Sometimes though, they rock. 
5. The Bento lunch special is alright. The box is large but the amount is wtf to a nation that likes everything bigger. Rah Sushi has a better bento lunch box.
6. Drinks are overpriced and tastes god awful.
7. Clean bathroom at least.
8. The tenpayaki chefs are actually great and funny. I do like their menu for that section. It's no Japanese, but it's good. Though overpriced. 

This place is no Japanese. Please stop thinking these joints are authentic. They are there to accommodate the majority of Westerners taste buds."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience in a long time, start to finish.  In fact, so bad that it motivated me to write my first online review ever, right here.  Waited over an hour to be seated, then ignored for another 30 minutes at the table.  Got our order wrong, brought out food we didn't order and forgot to bring what we did order.  Manager had attitude and was rudely arrogant when we requested a discount for the inconvenience.  On top of that, they like to price gouge you on holidays, because they can.  What's that? You're here to celebrate Mother's Day? Well, congratulations, we'll charge you the dinner price for lunch to thank you for being a great mom, and for being a great dad who will likely be too embarrassed to make a fuss over the price in front of mom on her special day.  Just ridiculous.  Portions are too small and even lunch prices are way too high.  Eating out should be pleasant, and this wasn't. Skip this place. We are never returning."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some sushi n kirin n sake, kirin n sake always good, we ordered omg roll, Vegas roll and some tempura shrimp n veggies. Everything was okay, not really blown away by the food. Service was decent considering the restaurant was empty."}
{"text":"Sushi is delicious, filling and prices are fair.  Take out or dine in , service is the same.  My new sushi place"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I only go during happy hour, maybe 2-3 times a month. They have a very nice atmosphere. The servers are great, so is the manager. But I really do dislike the whole gratuity tip. Every time I go its usually 5 or 6 of us and my $22 bill comes with an additional $7 gratuity tip. And they still expect the customer to leave a tip!! Give me a break... I go during happy hour for a reason."}
{"text":"They need a decent manager. It's a great location, and I'm not super picky, but we'll drive right past this joint due to its poor service."}
{"text":"The cook was great!  The meat cooked was good the rice was so so.  From the hostess stand to the waitress...they were just so so.  Took a long time to get the first round of drinks...and the 2nd...and a long time to get the bill.  Just too long.  Not quite on their game.  The waitress was very nice but the service was slow...the hostesses were uninviting."}
{"text":"Tastes like ass service is also ass. This looks like an old ass best buy. Never coming back gross rather eat at McDonald's"}
{"text":"The steak is good and the scallops.  Shrimp not so much and the rice is lousy.  The worst part was a roach crawling across the floor as we finished."}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant on one other occasion a couple years ago and the food was really good.  This time around the food was awful. We requested medium rare steak which was more along the lines of medium well.  The shrimp was over cooked as well and very tough.  The veggies looked about ten days old.  Our salads were swimming in dressing and difficult to eat without dripping all over ourselves.  On a good note the sushi and appetizers were good.

Server was nice and mostly attentive however his knowledge of the menu and how items were prepared were limited.

Definitely not worth the money - we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Three of us stopped their a week ago and had sushi. A few hours later I was very ill with lower GI issues which I attribute to some food product. I called the next day and the manager on duty said the GM would call back the next day as all I wanted to do was have them check the food quality. Well no one bothered to return my call so I guess customer care does not rate very high."}
{"text":"Where to begin? I will start by saying I took the family here for a family birthday dinner with the kids. We made reservations two weeks earlier for 730pm. Upon our arrival we were told they were waiting for our tables to be freed up. Ok no problem we were very understanding. We were sat 45 mins after our reservation time. Then even after we ordered it was well after 9 pm before a chef was available to even start cooking our dinner. The waitress while polite was unable to even maintain our water glasses much less the alcoholic ones that increase her bills. By the time the food was cooked and we were able to start eating they had club night starting. I was mortified to be sitting next to my nieces as the DJ was playing songs with lyrics such as \"let me see that ass clap\" and \"get get getting some head\"  The manager after being made aware of both situations was barely apologetic. After the second confrontation he offered a 15% discount. Yet the music continued to be repulsive for any dinner company much less for the children who were present. I can not begin to express the distaste I have for such an establishment. I will never be back!"}
{"text":"What a awful meal and way overpriced. Service was slow, tip added without knowledge. Don't waste your money here"}
{"text":"I have to say I have been there a few times before and had a blast. 
This time it was was such a let down. I took my kids thinking they would do what they are known for the show. We got our soup/ salad and in 5 min the guy came to make out food. No tricks no nothing. He made the rice. No flavor at all. The steak and chicken was to dry. We were there all for about 30 min. The manager gave me. 10% off my bill. Not much at all. I don't like spending 114.00 and not getting great service. I will never be back. Over all the worst place I have been to in a long time."}
{"text":"Just go to Tokyo Lobby on 59th and bell. Better prices, happy hour, and by far better food. I was only going to Ah So cause it was cheap and all I knew about."}
{"text":"Food is always great, I have never had a bad experience at any of the Ah-So locations. Great chefs and amazing service. The Beer is always cold!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I tried to go there with my wife and child for their happy hour but they wouldn't let us sit in the patio.  It was a beautiful day, one of those hard to come by May days where you just want to enjoy the outdoors before the summers unrelenting heat.  They told me it was for drinking and smoking only.  Apparently, they're not family friendly.  So if you have kids, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My wife and I regularly hit up Ah-So for Happy Hour. They have fresh and delicious rolls for half off. We usually get the Snow White Roll and the Sweet and Spicy Crunch Roll and shared a bowl of fried rice--all for less than $20 (including tip). The food is fantastic but very inexpensive!

We get seated right away and always have delightful wait staff. Such a pleasant experience every time!"}
{"text":"No happy hour on Friday afternoons??  Seriously? 
Also, it smells like urine in here.  I'm not kidding.  I noticed it the last time I was here, I thought maybe it was just me.  Nope, smells like pee again.
Don't think we'll be coming back to this location in the future."}
{"text":"Went to eat dinner here and requested no onions due to allergy and was told they couldn't accommodate us because they were to busy.  Manager said he didn't care that we have been long time customers. Awful customer service!!!"}
{"text":"I went here today with a friend for lunch.  We were looking for a good teppanyaki experience.  I've had better than Ah So.  The cook barely spoke to us.  The show lasted between 10-15min, and there was no flare.  I am a regular at Hayashi and was hoping for a comparable experience.  This was not.  

We had the gyoza and california roll which were the best part of the meal.  The rest of it was eh.  The vegetables were bland, the rice was unflavorful, and the chicken was dry."}
{"text":"Amazing service provided by Kiana, great happy hour food and drinks .... will be back soon .... pass on the place next door and go see Kiana !!  Vegas Rolls a must !!"}
{"text":"They should call this place ah so terrible. Sushi portions small and not fresh. Left a foul taste on my tongue for hours after dinnet. Prices high, tappenyaki chef was not very talented. Must have been a new kid. Food mediocre taste. Some food undercooked and some overdone. Disappointing. I'm having a hard time finding decent food in the Avondale area."}
{"text":"While the food is great, the music was OBNOXIOUSLY LOUD tonight when all we wanted was to converse at dinner. I usually love this place, but regretted going tonight. If I wanted to go to a club, I would have gone to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Our seating was crappy food was ok except they were missing stuff our cook was rude and told us the customer is not always rite(could have kept that to his self) waitress was not good poor her look lost price was high would not recommend"}
{"text":"Not sure why the ratings are bad. Came here because it was late, they were open, but was pleasantly surprised. Fantastic sushi and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Four stars for food overall. Chicken and steak.  

Two stars for having to wait at a teppanyaki table until others joined us. That's weak.  Waitress was excellent.  Performance of chef was weak.  

Overall would try again. Would hope for fire, flipped shrimp, cracked eggs and fun. Hope I get it."}
{"text":"Even though my meat wasn't cooked the right way and the service sucked by the waitress at lunch time, because she wanted to provide service to the bigger table.  The manager went above and beyond to handle the situation and he saved me from never coming back to that particular Ah-So's he has exceptional customer service and a great manager.  This happened on a Tuesday during the day not sure of his name, but he was awesome as for the waitress sucked!"}
{"text":"I have been to other Ah-so and have loved them, but i would not recommend this Ah-so. I've tried this place a few times now and have been disappointed every time. Sushi was horrible and very inconsistent. I have ordered multiple rolls on each occasion and each roll tasted funny or was poorly made. I could barely pick up the roll with out it falling apart. Service has been horrible. I won't be coming back to this Ah-so."}
{"text":"The food is not too bad.  Our server seemed very new and confused on orders and what should come out and when.  Other then that good atmosphere.  I will return."}
{"text":"I know I know service is lacking in this area and lots of reviews say so but I must say the service was the highlight of our experience here! Erica was our server and she was very attentive. We had a party of 8 - 4 little kids and 4 adults and she was all over our every demand. I write my reviews as a gluten free eater so I must say that generally I bring my own gluten free soy sauce when going japanese but as I was just visiting the area I did not have any and they did not have any as well. After speaking with the manager she was very accommodating and had the chef in the back make me a dinner that was free of soy sauce. That being said, the veggies were steamed (which is nice) but were not flavored at all - I had requested s & p and some butter, the steak was good. The rest of my party ordered hibachi and we enjoyed the chef's performance. They said the food was overly flavored though. 

**They were great about our reservation & told me when I called that their cc machine was not working and it was cash only that day. I could see this being an issue if you hadn't called first and went to eat there."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. Gave our table away then told us 15 minutes. After waiting an hour they still didn't seat us. Worst service I have ever seen. Terrible restaurant. Short bald manager was rude and dismissive after lying to us twice."}
{"text":"Good, healthy food.  Great for families with children. Service was excellent. My kids loved sitting at the hibachi table. Shrimp and scallops were very good."}
{"text":"the restaurant is a bit dark, most of the staff is blah. the food itself is okay... and overpriced."}
{"text":"I had some serious doubts about this restaurant when friends suggested it. I am in no way a sushi snob, but I have to admit that I have had my share of bad experiences at the larger chain restaurants that serve sushi. I'm not sure what all the negativity is about, but I was very pleasantly surprised. Does it stack up against my go-to favorite sushi restaurant in Scottsdale . . . Ah-No. Having said that, Ah-So still delivered on some fresh melt-in-your-mouth sushi that satisfied this demanding sushi lover.

The space is cavernous . . . very large, with modern decor. Tables were nicely spread out in the center while one side was lined with very spacious booths, the other wish a sushi bar and the far wall with teppanyaki tables. First a first-timer, teppanyaki tables are fun, but don't really work for conversations. It is really a show. For us, we had a table smack in the center. I am not a fan of being in the middle of a large space, but it was not cramped and actually quite comfortable. On a Saturday night, the space was not overly loud and we could still use our \"indoor\" voices and hear one another.

We had a fantastic server who I put to the test three times with my drink order. So, I have a particular mixture I like, and was quite specific. The first time he brought my drink out, it was way too sweet so I sent it back. The second time, for some reason it had soda in it, which wasn't in the list, and send that back as well (I don't do anything carbonated). Before he brought back another, he had the bartender come to the table to ask again. She was a doll, and brought back a perfect drink for me! I was impressed that our server didn't get rattled by my being so picky!

My other dining companions all had the teppanyaki dinners, and it was quite the serving, with soup, salad, a huge mound of rice and veggies, and their protein. The jumbo scallops were really jumbo. My only complaint in the food department is the soup -- bland, bland, bland. Otherwise, even the salad made of mostly iceberg lettuce was good when mixed with their tasty dressing.

A few more words about my sushi and sashimi plate . . . for $25 I also had soup and salad, but when they brought the plate, my eyes bulged out of my head! It was huge . . . enough for three people, at least. Seven pieces of tuna, yellowtail and salmon sashimi, seven pieces of of sushi, and eight pieces of spicy tuna roll!  You certainly get your money's worth here.

All in all, it was a way better than average dining experience. If you are not a sushi snob and live in the area, you will be very happy!"}
{"text":"I begged and pleaded with Dude to take me somewhere that would not ask me \"do you want to supersize that?\" for once, to have a nice romantic dinner.   After much negotiation, I got him to agree to sushi at Ah So.
     Dude likes to think that his fishies are actually cooked, so we opt for the fried stuff w/cheese.  I love love love their Vegas Rolls, however I think Dude would be happy with anything so long as it contains cream cheese!  It's a good beginner sushi...a while back I was fraking scared to death to try sushi, but some friends recommended the Vegas Rolls and I've been hooked on it all since.  Someone once told me that it was eel, but don't be frightened, its salmon.  Maybe that's why I find it so safe!  Hey, I tried it thinking it was eel.  However, problem is, because of that night, I'm now convinced eel tastes like salmon.  Yes, even though I now know it was the salmon that tasted like salmon... I never said my thought process was logical. 
     The Crunch Munch roll is a must for us every time too.   I'm never thrilled with the stringy spicy crab that's in it, but I enjoy the shrimp they put on top of it... perhaps next time I should just ask for the shrimp on something with a less disgusting consistency... it tastes good, its just weird! 
     We usually opt for getting a couple of the fried rolls, and then some of the cheaper filler sushi to keep Dude happy and full.   Last time we got the California rolls, I dig 'em, but Dude doesn't like the cold stuff, so this time he ordered Spicy crab roll...don't think he figured out those were going to be cold too, but he scarffed them down with way too much wasabi, and then I had a blast watching it kick his ass!  Hell, I think that's the best part of the whole experience is getting people to try the wasabi, and then watching them cry!  

     I've never had fantastic service here, but I've never really cared.  The atmosphere is peaceful and the spicy hot wings are incredible.  And sake bombers are a must when out with a group."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now. The tappanyaki is good. I have also order take out a few times and the hostess Keely was very attentive and made sure my order was correct. I normally don't tip for take out but I gave her 20%. I recommend the food  from here."}
{"text":"Food and chef were great.  Manager is terrible. Our friends were 10 minutes  late due to traffic and he was going to give our table away as they came in. ONLY 5 people waiting at bar.  Not crowded at all.  I feel sorry for the staff."}
{"text":"I made a 12:15 reservation for our Christmas office lunch. We were extremely dissapointed.  The chef finally arrived at 1:15 after we complained. During this time we were asked to switch tables because the grill was not working. The waitress looked grouchy. I don't think she smiled once. She did not bring the sushi we ordered at 12:30 and when I informed her we needed to return to the office, she seemed annoyed. I noticed the manager was standing near and informed him of our frustrations. He apologized, but made no attempt to make things right. To make things worse the restaurant was not busy. We work in a very busy dental office and referrals are important to us. We will not be referring anyone to this establishment. A little communication and a smile could have prevented a very unhappy experience."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Bad service, bad food, bad atmosphere. My husband and I were seated in a counter height table that felt cold and just plain out there. There should be some kind of separation between the waiting and dining area. We were seated and left alone. Finally a manager came by and took our beverage order while we waited for our  server. At this point it's still not a bad experience. 

We wanted sushi and teriyaki chicken so the waitress suggested that we split a teriyaki plate since it's big enough for two. Let me tell you, it's not. She said she could bring each of us a soup and salad which come with the meal. She also made a comment that in her opinion the soup or salad weren't that great. We ordered two rolls of sushi, one fried and one fresh. They were the cutest little things ever...little. Only four pieces per roll. They were good but nothing extraordinary. 

The teriyaki chicken was dry and the sauce tasted like something that i can buy at Fry's. The waitress must have thought we were Lady and the Tramp because she forgot to bring an extra plate so we asked for it. Then, the plate this chick brings is a long little plate that is used to serve sushi in. Really? Whatever. I just put some food on my little plate and let my hubby keep the big round one. 

How about that soup and salad? We had to remind the waitress that our meal came with this. She then asked \"you want both? Yes we FN want both! It comes with it don't it. But at this point I'm just like \"nah just bring the miso soup.\" She came back to \"check\" on us, SOUPLESS I should add, and asks if we want dessert. We didn't even remind her that she forgot the soup. We just said \"No just the check.\" Paid, let her keep the change... all 44 cents ( i guess my husband \"forgot\" the rest of the tip) and left."}
{"text":"Ah-So, or as I like to call it \"the sushi warehouse\". This has got to be one of the strangest Japanese restaurants I have ever been in. First of all its ridiculously uninviting. One gigantic room with warehouse height ceilings and a bunch of tables and chairs. Zero flair with no intimacy. I felt like we were dining in the middle of Costco. Unfortunately the layout and decor is the highlight of this place as the sushi is just plain terrible. When it hit our table it was luke-warm, chewy and pretty much awful. Check please!"}
{"text":"This place is OK.  The food is always good but parking can be tricky at times.  It is my least favorite of the 3 locations although it is still a very nice restaurant.. I would recommend heading to the 63rd and Bell location if you feel the food is more important than the aesthetics .."}
{"text":"This place is very yummy although my personal preference is the 59th and Bell location.  The food is good but its a loud open set up.  We have always had good dining experience and its right by the theater which makes it a good choice for date night."}
{"text":"Started with the Ah-So sushi which was amazing, great proportions, nicely cut roll.  Tom Cruise was our cook, very funny and entertaining!  We haven't been to a hibachi in about 2 years since we moved and this place was great!  Would highly recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"We called ahead and had reservations for 7 pm they asked that our party come early as they may be able to seat us earlier. At 715 pm we were still waiting with no grills open. After visiting with the manager at 730 and complaining we were told a reservation wasn't a guarantee that we would be seated at that time. At 8pm we asked to have appetizers served to our children on the restaurant. At 830 pm we were finally seated. Would not recommend this place to people who expect to be seated when reservation is and who have young children."}
{"text":"I have been here plenty of times and this has to be not only the worst experience but the worst review I will probably write. Our cook flung food and eggs at my husband by mistake and also lit the chopsticks on a plate on fire. Said both times \"well that's the first time ever.\" Our table was me and my husband and another family. No appetizers or sushi came out until we asked to cancel it. The waitress then canceled it said \"well it's free sushi do you want it or I will throw it out?\" The family at our table took theirs and it smelled so once saying that they weren't going to eat it she then said \"it's free so take it home and feed it to your cat.\" Not only was the manager not willing to step in after that but she got all of the receipts wrong and was just continuously rude until we all left. This is sad to say since the chef cooked the food too perfection that me and my husband will never be back ever again."}
{"text":"Do not come here!! Service is horrible !!! We stopped in at 1015 pm and were not allowed in even though they close at 11pm.. GM came out and told us to leave!!  Never will I come here again.. So rude!!"}
{"text":"We ordered a spicy Arizona roll and a golden California roll for sushi appetizers and this was the best part of the meal. It all went downhill from there. The hibachi meal (we had scallops, calamari, shrimp, chicken, and steak between the five of us) was flavorless and quite disappointing. The fried rice was okay, nothing to speak of. The vegetables were served last, which was annoying because they are my least favorite and by the time they were served the rest of the meal was cold. Also, the vegetables included lettuce which I have never seen at a hibachi restaurant... Grilled teriyaki lettuce is something I NEVER need to try again. Furthermore, the restaurant itself was dilapidated and a bit run down. The bright spot of this experience, however, was the hibachi chef; he was entertaining and friendly."}
{"text":"The sushi tonight was less than average.  They apparently use crab salad mix instead of real crab sticks for inside their rolls...which is a cheap alternative.  The Red Dragon roll was just ok tonight.  The Osakini roll was not good at all.  The tempura inside was cold, as was the seared tuna.  I expected the tuna to be seared on top, which it wasn't.  It was topped with a sauce that was just not good!  The only saving grace for this meal was the seaweed salad, which was very good.  Overall, I will probably not be returning for a long while, if ever."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this place. I do not recommend as our waitress with blonde hair was extremely rude and not very personable at all! The food also was not that great and was pretty pricey for what you get. I will not be back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good price on some decent ( I use this term loosely) sushi - definitely check this place out. Their happy hour is hard to beat anywhere you go, but with sushi, sometimes it's worth paying more for the more fresh/quality kind. Regardless, I will return because the service was great and the happy hour ro"}
{"text":"Whenever my wife and I think of sushi we go here!  Great dragon rolls, and the white tuna nigiri are our favorites!  Never had a bad service like other posts but need to understand sushi is hand made to order and can back a kitchen up.  As far as \"cooked\" dishes never had any just sushi.... Correction recommend the calamari sticks the were pretty darn good"}
{"text":"Was just told that they were out of sushi.... Like KFC running out of chicken. Didn't know that was possible, visit at your own risk!"}
{"text":"dynamite scallop roll is yummy. a little pricey!"}
{"text":"Ya know I really used to love this place! 
 We came today for our daughters birthday. The wait to sit was fine. About 45 min. All good. Friday night. How ever i noticed that that the menu prices have went up. I'm ok with that. I understand. Now I order sushi. Well it took about 25 min to come out and then they only brought one roll. I waited about 10-15 min for the second one. At this point the food was already cooked with rice vegetables and shrimp being put on the plate. I should of sent it back. But I laughed the eel tempra Shrank in size pretty noticeable. Haha. (11.00).  Then I noticed the portions from the past and they were the same size as the people sharing a dinner. So raise the price and shrink the portions. It's a good way to make more profit and a good way to lose your long time Custemer's!!!.  I think they have lost site of where they have started  on bell rd to where they are now."}
{"text":"I thought that the decor was nice and the food was delicious. I went with a few of my friends and ordered the filet! it was probably the best steak i have ever had.! 5 stars for ahso happy valley!!!! this is my first review! i am excited to check out the other ahsos! hopefully they will be as good as this one!"}
{"text":"This is a birthday tradition every year, and being in a new state I thought I would give this place a try with friends who visited from out of state. Our waiter was awful, seemed absolutely annoyed that we would bother him for things like taking our order and drink refills...?! but luckily the rest of the experience and food completely over powered his sh*tty job that his service or lack there of became more of a joke, which I'm sure he knew about. The guy we had to cook our food was social, courteous, and had everyone laughing hysterically practically the whole time. The food was wonderful and even better than my old birthday place. I wish I could remember our guy's name, because he alone deserves 5+ stars. Unfortunately I gave 4 due to the a-hole server."}
{"text":"I am sad to say that we will probably not be returning to Ah-So at this location anyway. Went for a nice Valentines dinner of Teppanyaki. Immediately noticed the stained carpeting which should have been a sign of what was to come.  Expected a usual wait to get  a table. Sat at bar and had apps and drinks and staff was not the friendliest. The one bartender struggled to keep up with drink orders as well as food. Waitresses were not in any hurry to get their orders out. We were seated at one of the back tables and were promptly asked for drink orders and then food orders. It took nearly 40 minutes for the chef to finally make his way to our table.  While waiting, I couldn't help but notice the disarray around us. Staff poorly dressed. A man wheeling a dolly through the restaurant into the kitchen.  Many customers throughout the restaurant were WAY underdressed.  Guys wearing wife-beaters (tank tops), baseball caps turned backward, etc. Baby seats do not need to be staged between cook tables for the convenience of the staff. Put them away until needed.  I don't want to have to look at a dirty bussing container under the cook table either. The food preparation was the standard display. When it came time to bite into my lobster, I felt like I was biting into a piece of rubber.  Way overdone. Medium rare filet was more like medium to medium-well.  This restaurant has gone way downhill and it makes us sad to think it was one of our favorite places. Just a bad element which has moved in and changed the whole atmosphere.  Owners and managers need to read these posts and do something about it.  You can easily train the staff to refuse service to those not dressed properly. Ditch the ball caps and pants half way down your butt!  The girl that seated us was wearing extremely short shorts which was not appealing.  A good restaurant gone bad.  Sorry for you guys."}
{"text":"I agree with the previous reviewer, it is an extremely strange design for a sushi restaurant. Much different than their other locations in the west valley. The lack of good sushi did not help our experience.  My wife and I had 6-7 different items and not one of them was great.  The dining room is set up similar to one giant banquet hall with table after table and no visual breaks in the room.  This did not help as the bar crowd (couple of younger guys slamming Sake bombers in tank tops) was visible and audible from our table and took away from our conversation.  To sum it up, mediocre sushi with higher than market pricing and a lack of atmosphere.  There are many better options around town that we will go back to before this place."}
{"text":"Terrible management, disorganized kitchen, chairs falling apart, overpriced mediocre food.

Came in just before 4pm on Mother's Day. Party of 3 - sat in empty dining area. The chair at our table fell apart when we pulled it out to sit. This should've been our omen to leave this place and never come back. 
Told their seaweed salad hadn't defrosted yet. Fine. They don't serve coffee. Ok. Placed order of salmon teriyaki, seafood teriyaki, an avocado roll and a 2pc nigiri- all as entrees to come out together. 

While waiting some sort of metal panel on a tepenyaki table fell out of the vent and landed on the grill. This place is falling apart. 

30 minutes later the roll and sushi comes out - I decide to wait for the rest of our meals to eat with my family. 15 minutes go by without our server checking in. We start to notice other tables that arrived 20+ minutes after us with larger parties receive their appetizers, then entrees. Flagged down our server. She acknowledged it had been 45 minutes since we placed order and said she'd check on it. Our drinks stay empty as we watch the servers huddle at the bar. I guess they don't cover other people's tables here? 

Another 25 minutes go by. We are assured the supervisor would come to speak to us to take items off or discount for the inconvenience. At this point we just wanted to eat! Entrees came out mediocre - salmon was overcooked, but edible. Veggies were good- liked the ginger sauce for dipping. Anything was fine at this point, we just wanted to get on with our day. Sever offered to bring me miso soup since I had eaten my meal like 30 minutes prior.

We waited another 15 minutes after everyone finished for this elusive manager - Chris Corona. He came out and was instantly condescending and combative. Guy, it's Mother's Day can you chill or show a bit of respect for my mom and grandma? \"Seems like you're upset about a small wait? You should've expected this wait, it's typical.\" Dining room was empty when we arrived-  tables that had arrived 20-30 minutes after us with parties of 5 were on dessert and closing their bills. When we tried to explain we had been there for over and hour and a half - he interrupted me and told me he didn't want to argue and would get us a gift card. We told him we didn't want to come back. Check came out without any discount. Flagged down our server again. She brought back check with 13% discount. Ok thanks. Put down card - were charged for the original amount - had to flag our server down again and she brought back the cash difference. Come on, get it together.  

Our server Caitlin was nice and felt bad for the disaster but it was a nearly 2 hour train wreck from start to finish."}
{"text":"Took my kids there and had an ok experience.  waitress was ok and made few mistakes on our orders.  We waited over 40 minutes and seated next to bunch of roudy teenager.  We ordered sushi and sushi was terrible.  we took a bite and sent it back.  Teppan sushi was mediocre at best and nothing entertaining.  We took our kids to Bennihana few weeks later and they had much better time( bit pricey).  Its ok place if you live close by but sushi I would not recommend at all... I hope this helps."}
{"text":"This location only, the staff is rude. The waiters/waitresses are slow. My last experience at this location was for a birthday. We had 7pm reservation everyone was there we still waited an hour to be seated & then another 55min to get our food! The 63rd ave and Bell location is amazing & a much better option!!"}
{"text":"Teppan-yukki, was sorry i paid so much, sushi may be better, people were nice..."}
{"text":"Going out on a birthday date, I wanted to give my date a good first time sushi eating experience. Though was left pretty dispointed and a somewhat hefty bill that was beyond what the food was worth.
Because this was on a Monday night, it hardly had more than 7 people inside so parking was a breeze. 
Inside the layout is pretty akward, and the high tables dont make it easy to be close to your date, the wide tvs were a nice touch and a huge selection at the bar.
Though the atmosphere was far from welcoming, we ordered the calimari for the appetizer and two rolls (shrimp and the dragon)
The calimari was very small in portion but i didnt mind cause it was extremely tough and bland. Our order sat on the counter for 20 minutes before the waitress finally took the time to stop gossiping with another co worker. The rolls were again bland. My date and I eventually decided to just leave and order from the nearby panada express which sadly was FAR better and cheap."}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I went here for date night. I don't like this one is much is the one in Peoria but we were able to get right in to a Teppanyaki table which was a nice surprise. 

I ordered the steak chicken and shrimp and my husband ordered The fillet and chicken. Everything was as you would expect for a Teppanyaki grill except that I never got the chicken that I ordered. I find that weird at a fairly expensive restaurant. Towards the end of the meal when the waitress came over I just discreetly told her I didn't get the chicken and they took it off the bill.

So overall it was a nice meal but I prefer Sapporo in Scottsdale for Teppanyaki."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential. Pros: The food was good and the drinks were clever. Cons: it was dead in a Saturday night. I was imaging how amazing it would be if the place was packed. The teppanyaki grills make for lots of spontaneous interaction at your table. It's a great place to get tipsy and be really loud! However, you get up and walk around and the place is dead, it makes for a buzzkill."}
{"text":"Server was great. The place itself was dirty, food all over the floor and when I told the hostess that there was food all over the place under our feet, she ignored me. Sushi was ok, and I agree with other posters that it was pricey. I hope to find a better option in the area for sushi. I have tried ari and it was pretty good."}
{"text":"We went for a \"surprise\" b'day, about 15 of us and the hostess (whom was very rude) refused to seat us until the entire party arrived. Luckily we were seated 5 mins before the guest of honor arrived. 
I ordered a spicy tuna -shrimp tempura roll which was fantastic! I also ordered the chicken yakisoba which the chicken was dry as hell so I sent it back. The teppanyaki chefs were very entertaining and the food they served was great. This place is ok but NOT outstanding. 
I think we'll stick to Kabuki at westgate where we are NEVER disappointed."}
{"text":"We ate here last night.  Good Happy Hour menu.   Great Vegas Roll

But also ordered Sashimi.  Menu said $15.00.   I was charged $17.00.  Waitress said price had changed.   

I had to pay the $17.00 price 


Unfair.   Won't be back"}
{"text":"Tonight was the second time we've been here where it took well over an hour to get our food. First, we weren't greeted until after 10 minutes of sitting down. Then the server came over a total of three times during our entire visit....after an hour of waiting, and two crying babies, we asked the server where our food was and her response, \"yeah it's busy. . \" That is not an excuse especially if we see you going to every table besides ours where you see us struggling to contain our hungry kids. An apology for the wait or even a sense of urgency would have made the wait worth while. The food is good, but the service is disappointing. DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Eddie was our chef and he was amazing :) Nice staff, clean resturaunt, nice atmosphere. The service was awesome too. We will definitely be back soon with a few people in tow!"}
{"text":"Do not come here unless you want to be disappointed and have your time wasted. Our wait was two hours and then the time it took for our cook to come out was another hour. Horrible service."}
{"text":"I have now been to Ah-So a handful of times. I really loved my first visit, but each time since has been worse than the last.

The biggest issue here is that everything is way more expensive than it should be. The service is pretty good and the servers are usually there to get what you need. The food is good, but has been slipping a little. Overall, I enjoy Ah-So, but the prices can no longer justify the experience. I would highly recommend going to Benihana instead for a much better value."}
{"text":"Sit at the sushi bar & ask for Kim's area. He's the best hands down. Fresh ingrediants put together well. Kim gets 2 thumbs up. If I had 3 thumbs I'd give him that one too. 
I love my sushi & as a recent transplant to the Westside I was on a journey to Bev-Mo & saw Ah-So. Desperate for sushi after trying a NAS-TY attempt (at the closest sushi Ichibahn on 99th Ave & McDowell in mid 2009) I was Desperate with a capital D for sushi on the Westside. I tried Ah-So & while better then the previous heinousness mentioned above we were still disappointed with the sushi. Everything was fresh but the rolls just weren't wow. It was more RA like (& you know RA is the McDonalds of sushi). Still desperate for sushi & on another Bev-Mo run (do you see a trend?) plus just not feeling like driving across towns to get some good sushi I tried Ah-So again. Oh wow what a big difference? We were seated in Kim's area of the sushi bar. He made the experience & the best sushi this side of Roku. They should erect a statue to this gentlemen in the entry of Ah-So. Kim we love you & hope you never leave the valley most importantly the Westside of the valley for greener pastures."}
{"text":"Ok- I can't even write a review on the food because the service was so bad!  We sat for 10 minutes and was not acknowledged/when we left,I said we were leaving because no one talked to us for over 10 minutes!! They replied,\"have a nice night!\"  OMG!"}
{"text":"I love this place. There has only been one time I was ever upset with the service I received by a waitress, hence why there is 4 stars and not 5. I have ordered for pick up as well and every single time I was waiting for my receipt one of the managers (bald guy in dress clothes) has asked me if I would like a free to go drink. That right there says \"good customer service\" because he could have paid me no attention. I also noticed he was floating around the room being very social and attentive to the customers. I always deal with the nicest hostess when I am there as well. Not to mention I love the sushi, I have eaten everything from a California roll to Tuna Sashimi and have never been upset with my choice. All around great place."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Seriously $20 for teriyaki chicken that was dry and over cooked no sauce. Service is slow and friend still waiting for sushi after 20 minutes. I will not recommend my friends or anyone else to this place ever! Stay clear and save your money!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Stellar people! Manager Robert is always pleasant and ensures we have a great experience! The chefs are the best!"}
{"text":"We have patronized Ah-So many, many times...After reading other reviews I have decided to post one based on our many experiences.  First of all, we love the Tuna Sashimi, has always been very fresh and very good.  We also get the spicy tuna roll, crunch munch roll, edamame and sometimes gyoza.  The food is why we have always gone back..We have never been disappointed with that aspect.  

The service however, has always missed the mark.  From rude or uninterested hostess/greeters to ever changing food servers to inappropriately dressed female bartenders.  We ALWAYS sit at the round tables in the \"bar area\", we may or may not get waited on before asking for service.  It seems that if you see a server, but you are not in their section, you don't get served...very disappointing that a server can see you have been there for a good 5 minutes and no one has helped you and they don't even stop to see if they can get you anything.  Another aspect that is irritating is the fact that we do frequent the place, at least once a week and never any type of recognition that they even know who we are.

All of that being said, and why I have now rated them at 3 stars...Last night (Saturday) we had an absolutely awesome experience!  They have a new Sushi Chef and it is very apparent based on the rolls and sashimi, as I said, we always liked the food but last night it was exceptional.  We like what they are doing with the decor, looks more like a restaurant than a sports bar, although they still need to do something with the cafeteria style look to the center of the restaurant tables...not inviting at all. 

Now for our service...our server was Ali, for the first time ever...He recognized us as regular customers, greeted us with a friendly demeanor and even remembered what we had to drink on previous occasions.  He got our order perfect, made sure everything was great, kept up with our drinks, etc without being obtrusive or overbearing.  He even made sure the manager Po, came over and introduced himself and chatted with us about the changes being made...this made for very personal service and an enjoyable evening.

I am only giving 3 stars, although last night deserved 5 stars, because I want to make sure they keep up with that level of service and that things are really changing around there for the better.  As of now...Great Job Ali and Ah-So Chef's!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Mediocre Teppanyaki & for $20+ a plate.... I'd rather eat Panda Express."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Ah-So everyone is so very nice to me. The cooks are very funny and friendly and are always trying to make conversation. The last couple of times I've gone Dave has been my cook and he remembers me and my boyfriend and talks to us and engages in excellent conversation. The food is always excellent I always get the Filet Mignon and its always great. The only complain I have is that they do not give large enough portions of fried rice and servers can be a little slow at times."}
{"text":"Horrible! I am from Philly and have been in Phoenix for a week now. I have had some great meals in this town, but this was not good at all. So-so service & yucky food. Nasty Appetizer, soggy salad & a tough steak to round it out. Avoid at all cost!"}
{"text":"Stay the fuck away from this place, especially during lunch. Poor service, inconsistent food quality. I've left unhappy more times than I've left happy. Do yourself a favor, go next door to PF Changs."}
{"text":"If I could give negative  10 stars, I would. The staff actually screamed profanities at us...the manager and his son, the sushi chef to be exact. I live a pretty drama free life and so it was beyond shocking.  Let me explain, I went to a super fun birthday celebration that ended in me chatting with the police barefoot on the cement because my high heels starting to hurt and deciding to NEVER eat at Ah-so on 75 ave and Bell EVER again!!!!! To make a long story short. My friend's daughter's sushi took almost an HOUR to come and when she walked up to our sweet server to ask where it was the sushi chef yelled about how busy it was a cussed at her! When we spoke to the manager he didn't seem to grasp the insanity of a staff member saying \"can't you see I'm F'ing backed up?\" I asked if he was the owner and that must have bruised his ego because a few more things happened and ended in the manager screaming, and I mean screaming in the middle of the restaurant. He told us to get the F#@$ out! and since living a real life episode of the Twilight Zone was not my jam.....We promptly left. My friend stayed and I guess the manager forgot that he screamed for us to leave using colorful language without giving us the bill...which I asked for repeatedly btw. He was in such a rage that he just ignored me asking for my bill several times and saying that I just wanted to leave. I guess he was in too much of a psychotic rage to remember that he said, \"No get the F*** out\" ...   and he called the police claiming we left without paying..... I spoke to them explained and they understood. However, my friend's boyfriend paid the remaining bill to aviod arguing about this insanity in court and he hopes to be reimbursed.  
It was a super fun night until it wasn't. Needless to say we will never be back to the Ah-so on 75ave and Bell and it all feels like a crazy dream."}
{"text":"Diners beware! They don't deserve your business!

Let me preference by saying I am not one to write complainants about restrauants, I usually just stop going and don't refer them to family and friends, but this one deserves a negative review in my book. I have never been treated so poorly by a restrauant's manager (Chris Corona) in my entire life. Please take the time to read some of the reviews that had negative experiences and mentioned it to him, he is combative and argumentative with his customers. 

I have dined here twice and this last time will be my final. First time...no problem other than service was slow and we never got any drink refills the entire time, second time was a total disaster though. Lets first start off with weird funky mildew/mold smell of the odd waiting room that you have to walk thru to get in the restrauant (first time I thought they might have gotten their carpets cleaned but noticed the same moldy smell the second time...ewwww). Then the sewage smell from the ladies room is pretty nauseous smelling. On the second time, we arrived at 430pm and was told by the hostesses that the wait would be 15-20 min max. 35 minutes later we were still waiting to be seating...I look to the back and see 3 out of 5 empty tempanyaki tables clearly open...the hostess said they were for a reservation that was late (as in over 20 minutes late). At this point we had at least 6 other parties waiting to be seated (I would say about 25 to 30 people total)... at 45 minutes we complain to the hostess that the wait is getting ridiculous as everyone is starting to get irritated and impatient, we asked where the heck was the manager? She went to speak to the manager...he comes to front and says \"what's the matter?\"...not hello, we are sorry for the delay, let's get you seated...but no...just \"what's the matter??\" In this condescending tone as if we aren't allowed to complain. I was first kind of put off by the attitude he had towards everyone right off the start but I went on to explain to him that we have been waiting over 45 minutes and was told no more than 15 to 20 min wait and it was ridiculous they were holding tables for late parties. He then went on to say with an attitude that if we don't like to wait, we should make a reservation next time...are you kidding? 430pm for 3 people shouldn't require a reservation in my book...I suggested to him he train his hostesses better on how to quote wait times or address the situation with the missing party. We sat down and here comes the POS manager again, he was obviously pissed off that someone challenged his managing capabilities (he gives off this \"my sh*t doesn't stink attitude\")...he comes over and asks again if there was any problem with this cocky attitude, at this point I was hungry and irritated by his condescending attitude...I just wanted to sit down and freaking eat in peace. I told him there was nothing wrong other than the hostess and his attitude. Then that set him off and he went off on this rant about how this was some multi-million dollar business (ok who gives 2 craps about that?), how he was going to give us a free meal but at this point we don't have to dine at his restrauant and that he doesn't have to serve us as he has the right to select his customers... at this point, after waiting for an hour, I was just gonna give up and leave but first, I asked to speak to his manager and of course he gives me the run around that he is the \"managing partner\"...so then I say you really don't want to give me the name of your boss. I ask for his manager's name and number again telling him that some deserves to know how poorly he manages his location and what attitude he gives his customers...he then proceeds to threaten me that he will call security if we didn't leave. I don't know if this manager was having a midlife crisis or what, but nothing calls for the attitude he gave our party and other yelp diners which you can read on other reviews on here (please read other reviews and their experiences with this manager, he seems to give off the same lines to anyone who tells him about any complaints or suggestions to him that he will threaten to get security if you complain). When you have close to over 90 to 100 yelp reviews complaining about the service, the hostess and the management that never really cares about feedback and threatening his customers...there is a problem. A major problem.

At this point this location doesn't deserve our family and friends patronage, nor do they deserve yours. Sadly the food wasn't bad the first time, and our chef was fairly entertaining but this manager left such a bad experience for everyone dining that I doubt anyone will be coming back....ever."}
{"text":"Please note the two stars given were for the  awesome chef and the taste of the food he prepared.  I called to make a reservation as I had a party of 8 since this was a bday dinner.  I was told I couldn't make a reservation since I was coming after 430.  My father went down ahead of us as he lives closer to get in line for the table.  He was told since we weren't all there that he could not put us on the wait list.  By the time I get there the wait is an hour and a half!  We had to make everyone wait an hour and a half.  The manager and staff didn't seem to care about the situation at all when I addressed how annoying their wait policies are and how I tried to go about this the appropriate wAy."}
{"text":"I can't believe how far this place has fell when Gary the chef left. My wife and I the number 1 and 2 of top check in here. My last experience the chef hurried and gave no show and way over cooked my steak that was suppose to rare. It came out medium well. I was very pissed that I spend so much money here they would basically spit in my face with the service. Then tonight we got seated and waited 10 mins then my wife had to get up and track someone down to get a drink order. After that the bar tender came to tell us it's going to be a long wait cause there is only 2 chefs. What happened Ah-So? Very disappointed!!!! You use to be 4 stars now I struggle to give you 1 star. Get it together!"}
{"text":"Ah-So disappointing might be a better name for this place...  As it was a oh so disappointing! And overpriced!  We went there with great hopes of a good meal, we were, at best, underwhelmed. My husband had the 'fish & chips' and I had the seafood noodles... His was completely flavorless and mine was mis-seasoned in my opinion (unless the goal was for the sauce to be gritty and on the almost dirty mushroomy plus very salty side.)  So unless you've been here before and just love it (if so, what are you ordering!??) I don't advise going... unless you have money you're dying to throw away.  Sauce is in the same area and a much nicer dining experience! :)"}
{"text":"We are here tonight. The food was really delicious. Tom Cruise cooked our dinner and was hilarious! I recommend you request him when you can. 

Our server must have been new. She lost our order and forgot to bring me water. She asked two other parties what their orders were more than once. And even when bringing our check she couldn't remember which couples ate what. Poor girl kind of became the joke of the table.

I'm thinking she must've been new to serving altogether and was making silly mistakes. Though it was annoying having to reorder our dinners or never getting my glass of water overall we had a good experience.

Again the food was REALLY good. The veggies were really fresh. I think I like this location better than the one on Bell Rd now.

Smaller, but nice."}
{"text":"If you've never had teppanyaki, you should try it. The food was good and the service was fine, but I would rather spend $30 a plate on something a little more personal.

The teppanyaki experience is unique. It's something I do recommend once, but for that kind of money, you can get much more than a cheesy show and a shared table."}
{"text":"Service was decent, sushi was ok."}
{"text":"I want to really love this place, as it is close to my home, but the price just does not match the quality of sushi.  My recent visit consisted of getting one of their special rolls, which resulted in the size of basic California Rolls you may get at the supermarket.  The flavor and taste were just ok, but there are definitely other places where you can get quality sushi for a better price.  Check out my other reviews.

We also went for teppanyaki, and this is always fun if you are with a group or a special occasion.  It is a typical price, and the food tastes like teppanyaki.  I may go back for the teppanyaki, but not for the sushi."}
{"text":"I would really like to be able to give a better review, because I used to frequent the Yuma location when I lived there and and it was always a solid 4.5 to 5 star experience. Unfortunately, this Ah-So doesn't live up to it. The cons: it took 15 minutes from the time we were seated until a server even came to the table to see if we had been helped yet, the table (teppanyaki grill btw) was VERY sticky, and the grill food was wildly over seasoned with soy sauce or whatever was in those squirt bottles. The pro's: big portions, good sushi and apps, and once our server, Cindy, did start to take care of us, she was attentive and helpful, no drinks went empty and everything we asked for was promptly provided. If you go here, definitely ask for Cindy. From other reviews, it's clear this place has service issues but from what I saw it's getting better. I recommend the sushi for quality and value, but for teppanyaki you might want to find somewhere else."}
{"text":"Terrible service and \"Seafood Noodles\" should be renamed to \"Noodles with 3 shrimp, 2 scallop and A(1) mussel\". I like noodles, but I like seafood more. Poor service, drinks took forever and TIINY portions. Very over-rated! Went once, not impressed at all, will NOT be going back. Easy decision!"}
{"text":"By far the best sashimi in Arizona. Fresh, large slices, & reasonably priced. Id stay away from the fried rolls, filled with a lot of imitation crab. But highly recommend the sashimi plate."}
{"text":"The service is slow and there are always at least 2 waiters standing around watching tv instead of working. 
Our waitress tried to be nice but it took 20 minutes just to get a draft beer."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi spots on thw west side of town! Complimentary miso. And not to mention their happy hour every day 2 x a day!!"}
{"text":"Food was so delicious, service stunk, and dirty bathrooms.. pretty much what everyone else said.  Not sure why they haven't improved on the negatives since they are all the same on Google and Yelp.  Had the edamame, sweet tofu, and tempura veggies.  Group had sushi rolls and lettuce wraps, everyone was happy with the food.  Sake bomber $7, good stuff!!  Will definitely be back but more aware that service takes longer.  No wait on a Saturday at 7 in the dining room."}
{"text":"Server was Nichole and she was great. Definitely the best server we have had there (go there 2-3x a month).  Long wait for teppanyaki which is to be expected during prom season so we did regular dining with no wait. Hostess was mediocre as usual"}
{"text":"As the nicer of the two Ah-Sos in Arrowhead,  I dig this one better.  It's newer, larger and more stylish.  

This place rakes the people in for lunch time, and you have the option to sit teppenyaki style (around a huge grill) or at a table.  We always opt for teppenyaki.  Never much of a wait for lunch, but I understand dinner can be hectic in this corner of the Valley known for Applebees and Chilis.

The food here is fresh, flavorful and always done up with a typical entertainer-like cleaver chop show - and service by these guys is usually stoic and efficient.  This time I ordered the grilled shrimp and chicken done up with fried rice and veggies - and it was delicious.  I tend to stay away from the sushi although they do have it here - so can't speak to that.

I come here infrequently, as lunch can set you back $15 - $20 or so.  But make no mistake - it's worth it."}
{"text":"I am giving 5 stars to make up for some of the 1-2 stars this place has received. We brought our 9 year old son for his birthday and we pretty much filled a table with our party. We had an excellent experience and I have absolutely no complaints although the place is kinda pricey so I advise to do the share charge and split meals. It's hard to find a GREAT teppenyaki place but this will now be our go to spot. Food was excellent, cook was fun, service was on the spot. Thank you this place deserves 5 stars as there are alot of people who are extremely difficult to please  as customers in the restaurant business."}
{"text":"If I could put 0 stars I would. Took forever for the hibachi to get started. Waitress was very forgetful. Never was around for drink refills. Only got my drinks at the beginning and maybe 1 refill and 1.5 of the things I ordered. No ranch or blue cheese for the hot wings. When I told the waitress to remove the items off my bill that I never got she got very rude. She still brought out the sushi that I ordered that had been sitting on the counter so long that the tuna was discolored and the avocado was brown. When I told her it was no good she told me to feed it to your cat then it's free. I used to be a waitress so I am very lenient but this was ridiculous. I will give the hibachi cook credit he made a great rare steak. But if you have erica as your waitress I would leave. Either that or try the ah so in mesa. They are said to be much better."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Today is our 5 year olds first time...he is so excited.  Great place for a back to school special occasion and for Colleen's birthday.  Fire is involved:)"}
{"text":"I can not believe how dirty this place has gotten.  I haven't eaten her in about a year and I was amazed how down hill it went.  I use to love the environment, now I'm truly disgusted by it.  The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the warm air and how dirty the carpets were.  It was as if the carpets had never been cleaned with literally hundreds of stains throughout the restaurant.  I have been going here since it opened several years back and I really just can't believe how dirty it is.  The bathrooms were filthy as well.  We sat at a teppanyaki table that had a dirty rug thrown behind our chairs. I was so put off, it almost ruined the food and for $100+ bill for two, you'd think they could afford a Rug Dr.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"While in town for work, we visited Ah-So. I was optimistic that it was going to be great as I love hibachi type restaurants. The restaurant just felt dirty. When going to the bathroom, it was absolutely gross. Dirty silverware. Just yucky! We did have a fairly decent server that was attentive. The food was nothing stellar but wasn't awful. Overall, it wouldn't be a place I would return to as I feel there are so many better options that could offer a good atmosphere, great food, AND a clean environment."}
{"text":"Horrible service and the worst part the sushi was below mediocre. Yen or Wasabi are much better options. (worth the wait)

When we received our appetizer we had to ask for plates. Then the worst part the runner brings our sushi out and no sign of the waitress for thirty minutes. Her name: Hannah.

I look around for her or someone, she is nowhere to be seen. I get up and go to the sushi bar and get my own dishes. Otherwise we'd be eating sushi with no wasabi,  ginger, or soy sauce. 

I ask to speak to the manger and he is pretending to write something down like he was taking notes and asked if we wanted an appetizer. Um no sir we only saw the waitress after we were done eating, why would we want an appetizer or drink when we are leaving. 

He says well next time you come in tell me and we'll do something for you. 

Next time I come in? That would be a never ever! 

Tacky place. If you're a early twenty something's westsider who doesn't care for sushi then this is your place."}
{"text":"We went in on a Saturday night without reservation and we quickly got seated at the teppanyaki area.   We had to sit there for about 5 minutes before we were tended to, but other than that, the experience was very good.  The chef did a great job and put on a great show with the food prep and cooking.   The waitress was quick to provide refills on drinks."}
{"text":"I found this place right after moving to the area and I'm so happy I did. The sushi is so good. Happy hour is only between 5-6pm but the deals are great. I will suggest to stear away from the seafood noodles. Everything else I've had here was great. It does get a little busy (it's the only sushi place for 5 miles around) and it's a bit pricey, but I keep coming back!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at Ah-So this evening.

The Philly and Las Vegas rolls were good.

The teppenyaki chef was a nice young man who was by far the most musical I've ever had.  He was constantly playing an upbeat rhythm with his utensils while cooking our dinner.

I have to admit the the onion volcano and train trick always makes me smile.

The steak was rare as requested, the chicken was properly cooked.  Everything was spicy in a Japanese salty kind of way.  A nice change from my preferred Thai and Indian fare.

All in all I would say Ah-So was on their game."}
{"text":"I come quite often it's close to the house and good people it's changed a lot threw out the years"}
{"text":"I would give them 2.5 stars. We did a last minute teppan date. There was just one other couple at our table. Our chef was very good, but since we were a small table and the older couple with us didn't interact with him at all, so our \"show\" wasn't the best I've ever seen. 

The food was typical, miso soup, salad, 2 shrimps each, choice of protein, and choice of rice. The food was adequate, good, but not great. My steak was a bit tough even though I ordered medium rare. If in the the far west valley it's a nice change of pace, but nowhere near as good as my personal fave sapporo in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. When we go to phx we always make time to stop there. Yet every time we go the hostess are very rude. Always seems to have a problem with them. The waiters are always great. I would suggest that they got on the hostess getting a better attitude towards customers."}
{"text":"We found ourselves here by accident last week, since the wait outside Yen (highly rated and just up the road from Ah-So) was INSANE.

FORTUNATELY..... Ah-So offers reverse happy hour deals to contend with their competitor.

A friendly waitress in traditional Japanese attire seated us immediately; $5 sake bombs were in front of us within 2 minutes (and complimentary miso soup); sushi was presented to us within 5 minutes of taking our order. This was probably the FASTEST service I have ever had.

We ordered four rolls - three off the wonderfully priced happy hour menu - and I chose a cherry blossom roll off the regular menu because I couldn't resist the fresh combination of three meats.

Yes, we were hungry. Yes, it was a nice, cool atmosphere with a little fish pond in the middle of the restaurant that enhanced the mood. Yes, there was alcohol consumed.  (Yes, there was an awkward couple across the room having a first date, which was entertaining to narrate: a little extra fun for us.) But, I can say with confidence, EVERYTHING was DELICIOUS. 

My cherry blossom roll was a fantastic choice, and I have found myself daydreaming about it since the visit.  My boyfriend was so impressed by the tempura roll - I want to say it was the Vegas - that he became giddy and proposed with a dollar-store ring right then and there.  We frequent sushi restaurants - I would say we are connoisseurs even - and I have never seen him so excited over a tempura roll (especially enough to elicit a proposal with a gaudy ring).

Total bill.....thirty dollars. Does it get any better than this?

The only reason I do not give this place 5 stars is that I do not love the location off the busy Bell Road. Also, it is next to one of those questionable massage parlors that has late hours. But maybe for some customers, that would only add to the appeal after a few too many happy hour sake bombs......:)"}
{"text":"IT was not horrible experience  but IT was not amazing either.

It took a little while to be seated even though place was not so busy. Once we were seated, it took a long while before actual teppanyaki experience started. 

The food was good but not worth the money. I personally think it was little overpriced. I would go back but if the prices were lower. For almost $30 a plate I would like my food to taste bit better. 

Also, I would like place to be cleaner and less cramped. I didn't like the fact they were bringing food for tappanyaki in the carts and it is not even covered. Anything can get on it on their way to the table. 

There is for sure room for improvement in this place."}
{"text":"This was our second visit. We were told the wait would be 15-20 minutes for seating at a Teppanyaki table (Thursday night in December.) The wait was actually around an hour, as the previous Teppanyaki diners stayed long at the table to visit. (We asked hostesses to offer to move them to a regular table to enjoy their conversation; hostesses declined.) The waiting area directly faces the restrooms; the sights and aromas are gross and disgusting. The service was slow and inattentive. The sushi, merely ordinary, arrived only moments before our dinner was ready, after we had inquired of its whereabouts three (3) times. Our chef, Tony, was friendly, entertaining, and competent. The rice and shrimp were amazing; the veggies overcooked; the filet adequate, at best; portions, huge; prices, over the top. My rating is one star, only because of the chef. Although our first visit was better than the second, I won't go back. There are many restaurants in Phoenix with better service, food, ambiance, and prices."}
{"text":"Went here Saturday evening around 6pm. Only 3 other tables seated.  Took 5 minutes to seat us, and then they tried to stick us at the two person low top tables by the bathroom hallway.  Eww.  We switched to a 4 top bar table and they put us at the only one without silverware in the whole restaurant. We ordered our drinks and an appetizer. Very slow to get the appetizer and when they brought it out we still had no silverware. We asked for some and they brought a fork and some paper napkins, even though every table has red linen napkins with silverware inside. By the time we got the silverware the appetizer was cold. We then placed our dinner order, and with that you always get soup and a small salad.  The soup was lukewarm at best, and the salad had approximately a half cup of dressing still in the bowl after I fished out the lettuce pieces.  Gross. Our dinner food again took a long time to arrive.  Our waitress never checked on us, never asked if we wanted more drinks, and we had to ask for our check.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I went with my dad, brother and my friends. I got the steak bowl but it is not what you think. It was a plate. What the heck! Also our waitress was a savage and held two drinks in one hand. But she gave us wrong drinks so I take that back. I also got sushi and the pieces were so unevenly cut, so I would get huge chunks of tuna. Great place for a business meeting because it is calm and quiet. The teppanyaki tables are pretty cool because the chefs do some tricks with there utensils and they make a volcano out of onions. Overall pretty good and I recommend to come here. Oh yeah!"}
{"text":"The service is is HORRIBLE. I went for a company party, you would think with that many people coming,( 13) with a reservation, they could of been prepared, but oh, NO.
OUR DRINKS WERE NEVER REFILLED WITH OUT ASKING AND WAITING...FOREVER. I was shocked. Every one was complaining, and it wasn't busy either.
As far food wise, meh, The best part was the fried rice , the sushi was average, the cooks humor was the only thing that made this 3 hour ordeal tolerable. I was hungry when I left, because we sat for so long OMG...will never go back again."}
{"text":"Omg really loud ... Not good at all.. Extremely loud .. The host sat us right underneath the blasting speakers not cool.."}
{"text":"Good service at the bar. Efficient, polite, and nice environment. The beer was a little pricey, but not surprisingly so. I ordered sushi: Las Vegas, lobster rolls, and sweet tofu. I must be a little spoiled by Mr. Sushi's happy hour prices, because Ahso's seemed pretty steep, but not abnormally so. 
He food itself was absolutely delicious. I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I thought the food was pretty good. I a sort of fried shrimp and vegetables as a starter and one California roll and some wings. I thought both the fried shrimp and California roll were good. My fiance ate the wings and she said they were bad. I paid only 13 dollars because I came just in time for the happy hour. The service was pretty good until it got busy. There was one bartender and the bar got pretty full. Overall it would be worth going here because of the happy hour and the decent sushi. P.S.  California rolls are hard to mess up. I also noticed that the chef comes out to your table and cooks for you which seemed pretty cool. I read an earlier comment on here about a cook coming out and joking around with a customer by calling him fat. lol"}
{"text":"I love teppenyaki!
I love their Vegas rolls! 
I love the chefs! 
I love AH-SO!

I just don't love their prices and cleanliness. Clean up your bathrooms!"}
{"text":"I came to AH-SO on Father's day with my family. The environment was pretty clean except around the Tepenyaki tables, there was excess furniture around which made it look unappealing. 

My family ate at the sushi bar while we waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. The sushi makers were very nice. Our server was okay. What turned me off about her was that my dad asked if she had lemons and she replied with, \"Yeah there's one on your cup... Is that okay or do you want more?\" Obviously he saw there was a lemon on his cup. Maybe he wanted that for his water and wanted the lemons for something else. She shouldn't of asked that and should of just brought the lemons like he asked especially on FATHER'S DAY :)

The rest of our family arrived and we got sat at a Tepenyaki table. Service was bad. Everything took forever. Nothing stood out to me about the servers/server assistants. The cook was HILARIOUS though. He did a great job with cooking our food and connecting with us.

Overall, the food was excellent, the service lacked enthusiasm, and the atmosphere was clean but could of used more organization."}
{"text":"Took my wife out for her birthday to ah-so sushi & steak, and I was greatly disappointed... This is more of a bar with waitresses that do not know anything about sake or sushi, the  miso soup was more of a chicken broth than the actual soup. The salad was just iceberg lettuce and 1 slice of tomato. Had flat screens all over the place showing sports and playing techno music. Went to the bathroom to wash hands and the bathroom was filthy. My wife ordered some kind of sushi$15, that she normally orders from other Japanese restaurant. I do not eat seafood so I ordered steak. You get ketchup and ginger sauce for your cut cubed processed steak $22... Don't waste your time and money with this place if you and your date knows true sushi and steak."}
{"text":"I absolutely love eating here. It is always my go to place for sushi and the tepenyaki grill is enjoyable with delicious food. I would give this place 5 stars without hesitation before my last visit, however now I have experienced a nightmarish dinner. I have always been that person who is terrified of any and ALL bugs. I somehow am always the one that finds bugs where they shouldn't be and not only afraid of the bug itself but also the fact that I was not expecting it there at that moment. So getting back to my dinner, luckily we were finishing up and about to get boxes to take home, I pick up my toddler and put him on my lap and this giant water bug (looks like giant cockroach) flies up out of nowhere and lands on my drink. Scares me half to death and my family starts freaking out because of my reaction! We called the manager right over and he did catch it and take it away. But as soon as he does my husband looks down and notices another one crawling around under the table. As soon as they catch that one I see the waitress Infront of me point to behind me. I turn around and find one crawling on the wall right behind me, they try to get it and couldn't see where it went, then I feel it....it had landed on the back of my shirt and I felt it on my neck as it fluttered from me back to the wall. Although this experience ended up being a horrible night, it will not stop me from coming back to enjoy the very yummy food. Next time though I will ask to sit farther away from the door. And the manager was very apologetic and nice and paid for my meal."}
{"text":"I've been going to the 3 ah-so's in Glendale/Phoenix for a while now and I must say, the entrees and sushi are just as good as they've always been. That said, I've seen a declining trend in the customer side as well as a declining trend on the workers here. It seems that no matter what ahso I go to, they are always hiring or understaffed so the staff the rest seem overworked, and stressed. This results in less customer satisfaction albeit I think most customers just feel bad for the employees. My only other complaint is that the miso soup tastes like actual boiled water, with maybe a little bit of miso in it. Food is great, service is trying but they really are struggling. Oh and the chefs are great too, always good laughs and something new."}
{"text":"Great server Daniel
And the sushi chefs  are so great Jimmy,Hiro and Tyler were amazing 
We will definitely come again 
Thank you guys"}
{"text":"I ordered the tuna tuna roll and the chicken and steak meal at the cooking table. This place is just like benehana, but less of a show. The sushi was tasty. The chicken steak meal was OK. The chicken was a little dry, but tasty. The steak tasted great, but was tiny. My main complaint is that there was a huge difference in portions and size of my steak compared to the guests that knew the cook. No, it isn't OK that you served me the smallest steak and a third of the chicken you gave to the costomer you knew. I understand that there is a little extra rice and veggies, but meat is meat."}
{"text":"I live 5 minutes away from Ah-So and love having a good sushi place so close to home!  I usually just sit at the bar and order sushi but the fish is fresh and the bartenders are friendly and give good service.  

The atmosphere is perfect for hanging out with friends over the deliciousness that is a yellow tail and scallion roll and a couple of cocktails after a long day at work. 

Would have made five starts if you could ever find a place to park... Seriously poor planning."}
{"text":"Food is usually pretty good but holy moly the floor in this building is so gross. Its dirty, stained, musty, smelly carpet. I'd be willing to bet that if the owners put new flooring in, the place would not only look and SMELL better, but business would pick up...and maybe they wouldn't have 2.5 out of 5 stars...just saying. Also, the weird little musty room that you walk into before you enter the restaurant needs something. And needs to not smell like that."}
{"text":"REVERSE HAPPY HOUR   9pm - 1pm 

Calamari
Spicy Tuna
Tempora
California
Edamame
and more. 

need i say any more?  


Loud, lively, friendly, busy place.   Great service!"}
{"text":"I went to AhSo for lunch, i usually go for happy hour.  to their W bell rd location....i will stick to happy hours.  their happy hours are.great.   their lunchtime menu and specials are not.

Service was \"ok\" it was my server's first week so i can't fault her on anything. 

Won't be back for lunch...."}
{"text":"In PHX on business and had been here before with some colleagues and had a good experience. Food was pretty average but service was good. Well, in a nutshell, same experience this time. I had calamari which was way over breaded and chewy. The shrimp shumai was good. The 2 rolls I ordered seemed fresh enough but just didn't wow me and while I high expectations for sushi, these were not complex rolls and again just ok. 

Service gets high marks, food does not. Hope others have a better experience."}
{"text":"3/6/15 - We went to celebrate my wife's birthday dinner and up until the very end,  we had a great time.....  It all changed when the short bald manager came to tell us to move.... As they need to turn the table....  The kicker was that we hadn't even gotten a bill yet.   Even after explaining this,  he mentioned again about moving. Easy to take a good experience and made it horrible!   When the bill came,  of course it wasn't via the manager,  so I told the server to send him back.   Upon arrival I clearly expressed my displeasure with this chain of events,  but honestly he couldn't have cared less.   I've never been asked to move, I understand it's a business but really...  Get your shit together,  you've lost customers over this one single horribly handled event."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with a big party plenty of room. I'm not really a Sushi person so I won't bore you with my insight.
 My California roll and Eel roll were pretty good for the 5 and 7 bucks I paid for them. I also had the Calamari and it was quite good it was strips of Calamari and the sauce had a little Asian twist. I not a fan of Teppanyaki either I think its to pricey for meat, rice, and veggies but they were packed so it must be good I'm guessing"}
{"text":"The Teppanyaki is fantastic and how can you go wrong with Saki Bombers!!"}
{"text":"I brought my 3 boys and husband here for Father's Day promising a volcano lit on fire, shrimp flicked into their mouths, and more at the teppanyaki grill.  Needless to say they were excited.  After waiting a very long period of time, the chef came out and proceeded to a table that has just been seated.  Our waitress notified him that he should be servicing our table, but he went anyway.  We then were given a sushi chef instead to avoid further delay.  The sushi chef burnt everything including the fried rice and eggs.  He was messy.  He didn't cut anything up.  He didn't do any tricks.  Worse, since he was burning everything, he set the smoke alarms right over our heads off for over 20 minutes!  10 mins in, half the restaurant had left, but we stuck it out since our meal was being served.  The staff offered free alcohol only, and skipped me twice in the offering, even though my husband told them that I wanted a drink.  Our kids were very, very disappointed.  All in all, we were there over 2.5 hours, which meant we had very sleepy little guys since it was way past their bedtime, and a $110 bill after the comped drinks.  What a waste of Father's Day."}
{"text":"Was really disappointed yesterday. Went in on a Sunday night and was quickly seated, as there were many empty tables. We waited several minutes for the waitress to take our drink orders, and then a few more to take out sushi order. About 10 minutes later, the waitress came to apologize and say our sushi order would take a while because there was only one sushi guy there. She told us it would be about 25 minutes and was that ok or did we want to order something else? Well we had a movie to get to, that at this point was now in half an hour (we'd already been there well over 20 minutes!), so we decided to leave--and the waitress brought me my bill for my $3 Coke! Now, I understand that I ordered and drank (part) of this, but in the service industry it's pretty common practice to comp something like this when it was their issue in the first place, and it's not like I ordered alcohol--a glass of fountain Coke costs about 4 cents to produce. I thought thought this was tacky and rude, and I will not be back again."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant once before and had an enjoyable experience. I realized that most of the experience consisted of alcoholic beverages, so this may have clouded my judgement. At the time, the restaurant also didn't have very many people. Tonight most restaurants were crowded, so we decided to come here. I ordered a grilled salmon plate, and it was okay. I love salmon, but left wishing for more flavor. Most of the vegetables were onions, which I thought was a bit odd. Even the fried rice was bland. This restaurant has a tepan section, so I was anticipating flavorful rice. I would give this restaurant a solid okay. On a positive note, the servers are very friendly."}
{"text":"We love sushi. We always order 1 special roll. Had it the first time at poway sushi in California (highly recommend!!!) it's always been fantastic until here. So disappointing! The manager told us don't order speciality rolls on a Friday night because we are busy. Ok we will keep that in mind and not come back. Terrible response.  Service slow and no bowl or dish to mix your wasabi and soy. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Today I went to lunch with some coworkers because we were celebrating some achievements in 2017 and wanted to plan for 2018. We had reservations for 11:30, right when Ah-so opened. They let us in and sat us immediately. We were all VERY thrilled with the service and the food was cooked perfectly! I wish I would have gotten the name of our cook because he was GREAT. Very very happy with the service today it was an all around wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Okay, okay, okay... I know I'm my previous review I said I'd never be back... well after two and a half years of not coming back I am back once again and that is only because the Hayashi by my home was shut down when we moved back to Surprise. We stopped by Ah so a couple of months ago and to our pleasant surprise our favorite hibachi chef was employed there!!! TOM CRUISE!!!! aka Jessie!! We loved him at Hayashi and would only request him. Nothing has changed and we love him and his abilities as a chef. He makes everything fun, entertaining, and delicious. If you love teriyaki sauce like my husband and I do get it on your vegetables and meat! It makes the food that much better! Over all service was great and the manager (Tony) I think his name was is a very nice and personable man. This visit turned my never be back again and turned it into I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Very bad experience first dining in didn't get a drink refill the whole time we were there an also had my appetizer brought out after the main entree had been eaten.  So I decided to order into my home an pick up, after doing this a couple of times ordering the same thing mind you.  Our last order of rolls were half the size of the normal order we do so I call an the manager is a jerk an tells me I am wrong an it's never made the way I always have it but what would he like us to I told him nothing I'm good will take my business somewhere else from now. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"Been here before but for whatever reason I didn't review. After my second visit, seems I have a better grasp of what to say. Plenty of parking in the area and easy to get to. Place doesn't get overcrowded but I highly recommend reservations if you are looking to eat teppanyaki. Tables were not full but I arrived with a party of seven and they weren't ready for us. The wait was 20 minutes to get a cook ready, although not sure why. As promised, we were seated 15-20 after arrival and the ordering process is simple with attentive wait staff. Nothing out of the ordinary seen to say the place was dirty or clean. Everything looked good. Food and drinks have good prices and the cooks are accommodating to your special requests. A pleasant goodbye from the cook and host as we left the establishment. Overall, nothing shout out at the world about but definitely a good spot to go without heading far out if you live in Goodyear."}
{"text":"My husband has been in the food industry for 25 years. It makes it difficult for us to go out and eat sometimes because he can be very critical because of his background in this field. In this case are dining experience initially started out great. The hostess was friendly, our server was fantastic. The food was delicious as usual. While we were eating I noticed one of the staff texting continuously on her phone within visibility of the dining guests. She didn't seem at all concerned about what was going on around her. I tried not to notice because she was not our waitress. About 20 mins into our meal I then saw her now eating out on the floor. Very unprofessional in my opinion. Again I tried to ignore her because everything else had been so good. Me and my husband strongly believe in letting someone know when they have done an exceptional job. We asked our waitress if we could speak to the manager to let him or her know how great everything was. Our waitress then pointed out that same individual who had been more worried about texting and eating and said yes she is right over there her name is Maize and she is my assistant manager. I quickly told the waitress nevermind there was no need to disturb her, and that she had done an excellent job which we reflected in her tip. I have nothing against young managers if they are qualified for the job. This girl was clearly not ready for this type of role and reflected very poorly on AH-SO. I was so disappointed to see this was who was running or should I say not running this location. We love AH-SO but we will most likely be dining at a other location on our next visit. If that is how she manages I am concerned about what else may go on behind the scenes. Please do yourself a favor and hire someone who reflects you and your staff in a better light."}
{"text":"I love sushi so to see a west side location that had a variety of rolls was nice to see! Also, the happy hour prices are ridiculous!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the happy hour deals are great. The problem I have is the service. We sat for 5 minutes before a server came over and that is only because we asked is there is a server available. Food came out pretty quick, but had to keep asking for water, and our bill.  The owner was good when we asked him for stuff, but he needs to have a talk with his staff about customer service."}
{"text":"Went here for my friends birthday, there was 10 of us and we decided to do the tepanyaki. I've always gone to Benihana but I figured we could try this place since it was closer. Well let's just say I wish we went to Benihana. When we arrived our table was filthy! They clearly didn't care to clean it. The water tasted like it came from the sink and the miso soup was awful! Our chef was an older man and the first thing to turn us all off was the soggy bandaid on his finger! GROSS! The rice was overcooked and burnt, the shrimp was NOT deveined and the chicken was dry! It was horrible! If I'm paying $20+ a plate, I except fantastic food & service! The cherry on top of it all, our chef, when done cooking, took a filthy cloth to clean the grill and soaked it in nasty water and splashed a couple of us in the face and all over our food. Let's just say I warned you."}
{"text":"This place has potential but it was by far some of the worst service I've experienced in a while.
 I walked in and sat at the bar with my friend. After about ten minutes we had to flag someone down to take my order as the bartender had still not made himself available. There where only 3 other tables in the restaurant so someone should have noticed we weren't being taken care if. Definitely was given the impression that there was no manager on duty.
 The service was just good enough for us not to decide to get up and go somewhere else. We did like the food and while the service was bad it just seemed like the staff needed more training. I did spill my glass of water and the staff was attentive in getting everything cleaned up right away.
 The bartender did have us cash out before he went on break. That wasn't an issue but be didn't introduce us to who would be taking care of us while he went on break. Maybe because it was no one. Once we cashed out with the bartender not one employee checked on us the rest of the time we were there.
 We where there on 8/15 from 2pm to 415 pm."}
{"text":"two words.... SAKE BOMBERS!! the fillet is great. Sushi is top notch."}
{"text":"I love this place! Every time I go here I am happy I did. I go here almost every other month including my birthday. I order either seafood and steak or just seafood from the tempanyaki menu. I've also been here for sushi and that's  great too. Highly recommend this place to everyone. 

Last 2 times we went Connor was our server. He is amazing, highly personable, and makes sure our needs are taken care of. Highly recommend. 

You won't be disappointed. If you like seafood and sushi you will LOVE this place. If you like steak and chicken you will love this place. 

It's not terribly pricey given what you get. A LOT of food and very good quality. After all it is a high end steak and seafood place."}
{"text":"As I am want to do, trying newly opened restaurants is kind of fun. So I stop in to the new AH-SO Sushi & Steak in Goodyear. It is an open modern room with a few TVs and overly loud rock playing. So I wait at the host table in the entrance and wait some more. There are perhaps two table of people already seated, not unusual for 2:25 pm.
I spot the menu and as I wait I take a look, not over ambitious in choice and far from inexpensive but I figure give it a try. So I wait some more. But it the end I give the door another try and leave, I am not about to waste my life waiting for a fool to see they have a customer wanting to be seated. So for me it is AH-SO_No."}
{"text":"We stopped coming here a year or so ago. Food was so so, wait staff surly, and never left feeling like I enjoyed a nice meal.  Fast forward to last week, our favorite Ichiban on 99th and McDowell has suffered, Fresh Wasabi still good but hardly great, and I had a gift certificate.  
Wait staff now attentive, friendly, acts like they are there to serve you, but the food, the food is the freshest, most creative, balanced, and in all ways now the best sushi in Phoenix (or my side).  Talked to the manager, I guess they identified an issue (or a couple) and have been working on correcting the problem including a new fish vendor direct from LA.
if you haven't been for awhile, give it a try again.  The hamachi kama is the bomb.  The vodka fired dishes are incredible."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to this place and unfortunately I am unimpressed. The sushi looks mediocre at best. The tuna in and on the rolls was light pink instead of red. This tells me that the quality is not the best. It tasted as if it was not fresh. They split the teriyaki bowl in half and put it on to a plate instead of just leaving it in the bowl. The only saving grace to this dinner was our server named Connor. He was polite, friendly, outgoing and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is great for happy hour and if they are not crazy busy, if they are slammed don't waste your time - they can't handle it well.  Happy hour at sushi table is a great deal for sure."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst restaurant experience I havehad in awhile.

It's like a sleazy sushi-barrio place."}
{"text":"Asked to sit at the bar.  Seats open at the bar.  Told 15-20 wait.  Then let other people sit in those open seats at the bar.  Hostess fail.  Then said we could sit at open 4 top.  Put silverware down.  Still standing.  To be continued or we just leave.  Not sure yet."}
{"text":"Ah-So Sad is what this place should be called.  We'd read the Yelp reviews before we went but were really, really hoping to like it as it is the ONLY sushi joint in this area.  We had called in our reservation prior and were seated right away... so it was off to a good start.  And yes, the decor is very multiple personality... but I could care less if they have good food.  We waited for a few minutes for our server, then a few more minutes for our waters and a long while for our beers.  The sushi combo's seemed somewhat odd, but we figured we'd give them a shot.  Lots and lots of tempuras in the rolls, which is not my thing... if I'm ordering sushi I was fresh fish... not a bunch of fried foods.  So we ended up ordering a Sunset Roll, a Spicy Tuna Roll, a Surprise Dynamite Roll, and order of Yellowtail Nigiri and an order of the Sake (Salmon) Sashimi.  We waited forever for the waitress to bring out our miso soup, which she actually spilled a lot of my husbands as she was walking away and didn't check, apologize, or anything... just walked away.  The soup was your run of the mill miso and thank goodness she brought it out  because we then had to wait WAY to long for our sushi.  While waiting for our sushi, I noticed one of the other servers attempt to deliver our sushi to two other tables, before finally deciding she didn't know where it went, took it back up to the window to sit and walked off.  I did notice she told our server the order was up, at which point our waitress took off to the kitchen.  So were are sitting there at our table looking at our food on top of the sushi counter... wondering where our waitress was.  At one point I almost got up to go get it.  10 minutes later our waitress finally emerges from the kitchen, gets our sushi, brings it to us, and casually asks us, \"Everything okay?\" and then walks off.  It wasn't much to look at, but hungry... we dig in.  My husband never has a problem with eating sushi... usually I'm the one that makes the mess, but every single roll we tried fell apart.  This was bad sign number one that this place doesn't know what they're doing when it comes to making a sushi roll.  And the hits kept coming... #2:  our spicy tuna roll was basically chopped tuna and wasabi = not a real spicy tuna roll.  If a place cannot even make a spicy tuna roll it is a bad sign.  The sunset roll was the best out of all of the rolls we ordered, but I noticed that they don't use real crab... it is all imitation here.  The Surprise Dynamite roll was quite bland and my husband mentioned that it was really dry for a roll that has sauce and is baked... and again was filled with imitation Krab.  Our nigiri and sashimi were good, but this day in age with shipping and the ability to be able to get fish anywhere and anytime... you really cannot screw this one up.  

All in all... the rolls were pretty tragic and sad.  Use of imitation Krab is not okay especially when the prices were inflated.  And the prices of our rolls, but especially the nigiri and sashimi was ridiculous (and not in the good way) considering how little we were given.  Any other sushi place we've visited when ordering that much we are stuffed upon leaving, here we actually decided we were both still hungry so when to get some fro-yo elsewhere.  And service... well, that definitely has room for lots of improvement as well."}
{"text":"Way to expensive, small portions, terrible service, and the food is decent at best."}
{"text":"Outstanding food portions...wait time at 6pm on a Friday night wasn't bad at all. Management and staff make you feel comfortable. When you sit at the Teppanyaki table, ask for AB -- great chef/cook...kept my entire family laughing while he was burning (cooking)! And the food was cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"Took almost 90 min for one spicy tuna roll. Food was decent once it arrived. Given the length of the wait, I suspect they had to catch the tuna before preparing it."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times. While the food is decent, the service is hit or miss. They seem to be hiring new people as the last time I was there we had a new server. I wish the happy hour sushi menu was more extensive. Overall it is a decent place, but not outstanding."}
{"text":"The food here is good. I would probably give this place four stars if they just operated like a normal restaurant and met general expectations. The first time I came here, I met my boyfriend, who arrived about 10 minutes before me and ordered a roll to start for us. I arrived shortly after. The waitress brought our food and took off without a word. I initially wasn't bothered, but she never came back. Not only did I get no water for the whole meal, but the next time she showed up within shouting distance (easily 25 minutes later if not more), she dropped the check and walked away WITHOUT A WORD. We actually wanted to order more food, but we were so irritated by then that we actually just decided to pay. She hadn't returned for the check for at least another 15 min, so we ended up leaving cash just to get out of there - and then went to another restaurant for more food. so it took us an hour plus for an appetizer and no water (for me).

Because I thought the food was good enough and the location was convenient, I took a friend about 2 weeks later for lunch. it was a Sunday afternoon and we were one of only two tables in the dining room. The EXACT same thing happened to us. The only time to get a refill was if you timed it so she was delivering the food. then the waitress actually just went in the back and didn't return for 30+ minutes. It was quiet this time compared to the previous visit, and it wasn't a matter of us just not being assertive enough to get her attention. She physically wasn't in the dining room for half an hour while we chewed on ice. It was when she came over and did a drive-by check drop that we were able to stop her and say that we didnt want to pay yet; we wanted more food, wine, and water. i remember distinctly asking myself if I should order two waters since I may never see this woman again.

I'm not an easily frustrated person when it comes to restaurants. I just cannot believe I had the same crappy experience at two radically different times of operation for this place. if the service were remotely decent,  I'd actually be a regular since I'm so close. I cant, in good faith, ever send a person I like here unless they have 2.5 hours available to get a single water and sushi."}
{"text":"In Peoria, this is where we love to go to for sushi. The bar tenders are friendly. The prices are not too bad. My niece loves the chicken here. If you come during the week there you don't have to wait, and the food is just as good!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is pretty good. Food quality has been going down for the last year. it used to he really good and now its a little below ok. Sushi chef Ino is the best though."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in for some late night sushi and a little side of fried rice and it was delicious. 

We order 3 rolls ~ Fire house roll, caterpillar roll, and sweet and spicy crunch roll, nom nom they were so good.  

Our service was good. We got seated right away and our waitress was super nice. Everything came out in a timely manner and overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"First visit for lunch. Shared two rolls ands bento box and each was great. Service was also very good.  Restaurant was quiet with about 12-15 customers."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I have been here. What a huge disappointment in customer service. After a lengthy wait in a relatively empty restaurant I would never have imagined the seating location is now mandatory. We wanted to sit on the tables end and the hostess insisted we must sit in the middle of the table. The explanation you ask..... In case they get other guests. Apparently waiting patiently for a table isn't important enough to be a guest who counts. I can't speak for the food because of course I took my business to a location where we do matter."}
{"text":"Boyfriend took me here for my birthday and absolutely loved it! We just sat at a regular table and I believe our servers name was Christina? Anyway she was AMAZING! Super fun, gave us time, joked with us and was ready to help when ever needed! I got the desert canyon roll that she suggested and it's now my favorite roll!! Hands down 5 stars all the way and now our new happy hour spot! The manager was even fun and joked around(:"}
{"text":"Very very disappointed with the service, we didn't even get to order... Used to be my fav spot to eat sushi and steak but ever since new management came along something always goes wrong but this time was my last drop :(... The wait is too long, waitress was not friendly and the so called manager was really rude."}
{"text":"First time at Ah So. Came with two coworkers for a birthday celebration. 

It all started great. We were seated in the empty teppanyaki section and only waited 5 minutes for our orders to be taken. Often it can take 20-30 minutes for them to pair you up with others. 

We all ordered steak and shrimp, which came with soup, rice and veggies. The server was attentive and kept our glasses full. The chef was engaging, professional and performed his 'show' with confidence and precision. So far: 5 stars!

The downfall came at checkout. The internet was down, so our server couldn't cash us out. She knew we were at a work lunch but we didn't see her for a full 15 minutes. Later she asked if she could run my card thru the old way, taking an impression. That was fine but without apologies, discount, explanation, regrets or referral to the manager. I could've easily just walked out earlier but that's not the way I roll. She should consider her customers even when things aren't going to plan. Especially then!"}
{"text":"My review doesn't include food quality, but only how management of this location lost my desire to visit again in the future.  My wife so looked forward to a Japanese teppanyaki style dinner for her birthday.  After spending some time online, I chose this restaurant.  I did not see any mention of what was about to happen on arrival.  Upon entering around 6:15 pm, I was told there were no tables available and that I could come back around 8:00p pm.  I told the hostess we just drove from Sun City (about 20 miles) to get there.  She apologized and explained that they were expecting a large party and that they only had two chefs to do the cooking.  Mind you, each table can easily accomodate 8 to 10 people and there had to be at least 5 tables completely empty.  In fact, the party of 6 that came in right behind us, also left right behind us.  I don't know why the manager did not make appropriate arrangements to have available staff to handle the situation.   I can't imagine the money that was lost and the number of patrons that left as upset as I was.  A quick search brought up Hayashi Hibachi that was a couple miles away.  My wife enjoyed the teppanyaki prepared meal, the chef was great and we met a nice family from Michigan at our table."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Very disorganized. 

It first started in the parking lot which cannot accommodate the number of customers for the plaza. So show up early and expect to have parking wars. Took me close to 20 mins and settled for an illegal spot by the dumpster. We made a reservation for 7:30 and weren't seated until 8:30. Finally ate around 9. When we asked initially when we would be seated no one could give us a time and the manager dismissed our complaint. 

To top it off a bartender asked why the other was miffed and she said \"it's nothing, just that bitch wants water\" as I saw her to deliver it to my cousin. I confronted her about it and she tried to play it off saying \"oh I wasn't talking about her\", uh huh. Horrible horrible experience for overpriced okay teppanyaki"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Phoenix area!!!!! House special rolls are to die for especially the Ino #2, it is amazing mouth watering just thinking about it. Staff is friendly drinks are rocking."}
{"text":"I was in the mood to try Tepanyaki and Ah-So is much closer to me than Benihana's.  But I was not happy with the food.  It was not as tasty.  The fried rice was pretty bland.  The soup they bring you and the salad were pretty tasty and the shrimp we got was worth it.  I don't think I will go back though b/c it just wasn't the same as Benihana.  For as pricey as it was, it just wasn't what I hoped for tastewise.  Meh."}
{"text":"New management, so the service really needs improvement. The wait staff is great and friendly. Our waiter was Angel, and he was super  polite and very helpful. The problem: Seth (the manager) wouldn't honor the misprint on the menu, tried to sit my group at a table that was already overfilled, and never once tried to make the experience any better. He was rude, argumentative, and defensive, not management material. 
I'm personally not coming back and wouldn't recommend the restaurant to anyone until the management situation changes"}
{"text":"Decided to run in here, because it's close, for a quick sushi dinner and afterwards, we wished we hadn't.  They were NOT nice to us, it was like we were inconveniencing them, even though there were many many empty tables.

So... as we are talking with the hostess, working on being seated, some snooty chick comes up, interrupts and says, \"um, we need to be seated NOW\".  The hostess then asks, \"Is your party all here?\" (which is necessary when you are doing the teppanyaki) and the girl said \"No, but they will be real soon so we need to do this now.\"

I wanted to slap that girl.  Where are these people's manners that their momma taught them!?  I don't care of you think you look like hot shit, I was here first, so don't interrupt and then proceed to be rude.

So we order some of the specialty rolls.  And were told some 10 minutes later that one of the two we ordered is not available.  So I picked another.  Waited another 10 minutes.  Then was told the other one of the originals wasn't available.

... Really?

So I actually had to ask the server \"So which ones can I order where I'll actually be able to get it?\"

Bad news.  I'm real easy going because I know just how hard that job is, but come on.

I just love being ignored too... no acknowledgements, no \"hope you enjoy your food\"... no \"do you need a refill\"... wrong.

Don't appreciate it.

The only good part of the whole night was a server named Steven who came up and joked with us when delivering the last roll.  That was the highlight.

I've decided I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Sushi was about average to what I've had elsewhere. Management was terrible. We stood at the host stand (at 9pm when the restaurant was less than busy) for over 5 minutes before the manager, who was chatting with someone at the bar, asked for the bartender to seat us. Our server was nice but we ordered an appetizer that never came out. Food cost more than it was worth. 

I'm not coming back. This was my third, and last time here, and it has always been the same."}
{"text":"Ate here last night and was really loving the steak I got.  Everything tasted really good and don't understand these bad reviews.  I will come back."}
{"text":"Sushi was ok not bad.Do have to say there tuna tar tar is yums. Hubby had fish and chips he said the fries where good but not the fish."}
{"text":"Our group had a fabulous time at Ah So Goodyear. Food was delicious and quick. Drink specials were on point and the overall vibe of the place was very welcoming. Manager is a class act too - can't remember his name."}
{"text":"I have finally gotten around to writing a review on this place.  First of all, the food here is at best inconsistent.  We have eastern here about 5 times and the 5th is our last!  Who puts pink rice paper on a spider role?  Service is always mixed bag.  Sometimes good, sometimes really bad.  Why did we go here 5 times?  Because we live in Anthem and we were looking for some good sushi close by.  Will now travel into Phoenix, Peoria, or Scottsdale to get good sushi.  This place is pricey and not worth your money or time."}
{"text":"I took my mom and sister out for sushi one night. We stopped by this Ah-So location because we were nearby. However, we ended up going to their other location.

They only have two regular tables and all of the others are high stools. I realize the high stools and tables are trendy, but they aren't practical or considerate of all patrons (e.g., for older patrons a high stool is not easy to get on and off). In addition, the two regular tables were near a drafty door and a large sign that had the nightly specials was right against one of the regular tables. Anyway, needless to say we ended up leaving because the atmosphere did not feel welcoming and we wanted to celebrate a family special occasion. 

I'm not sure about the quality of food since we didn't even make it to a table. But their other location was good and accommodating."}
{"text":"Fail proof happy hour!! the food is always fresh and the service is always quick"}
{"text":"On a Saturday night, the place was packed! Our reservation, though, was right on time and our party of eight was seated at the teppanyaki bar. The chef performance was a lot of fun to watch, and the food was very good. It was a great place to celebrate a birthday."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for something different for our anniversary dinner, so we went for reverse happy hour a few days ago so we could check the place out. Even though we got there at 9pm and they were closing at 10pm, the staff was very nice and answered all our questions about the menu and teppanyaki.  We had a couple of appetizers and beers at the bar, and the bartender gave us some suggestions on her favorite sake. We decided to make a reservation for our anniversary on Saturday and asked when would be the best time. The hostess recommended coming in after the dinner rush, so it wouldn't be so crowded. Daniel, the manager, was also very friendly. I am looking forward to enjoying a nice dinner out, since I've never had the teppanyaki before. It should be fun!"}
{"text":"Firstly, service here is always MEH. The price you pay for the amount of food you get is laughable. You get literally 4 pieces of veggie tempura.  Every other sushi joint I have been to I always get 8-20 pieces of tempura! I've never had a server that was very friendly or competent. If I were you, I would head to the ah-so on 6033 w bell road. A smaller location with better faster service and WAY more food that actually tastes good!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst experience I have had at any restaurant in the Phoenix area. It took 10 minutes for the hostess to even appear to seat us. Our waitress came to the table 4 times as she and all the other waitresses and staff were more worried about following the manager around playing around and flirting. But the worst part was the food by far. The tempura shrimp and veggies were soggy and the sushi was something I could get in a grocery store.... Gross!"}
{"text":"May 19,2018 . Ordered takeout this evening from Sky who answered the phone at Ah So. I ordered two dinners , one for $24 and one for $27. Total was about $60 + tax and l left a $5 tip. Got home and found out we were missing the soup and the salad. Called back and spoke to Sky , she apologized and said oh I should have told you that we don't include those items unless the customer ask for them , SERIOUSLY! We expected to get what was on the menu for that price.Not worth the drive back but won't be dining or taking out any time soon . Even though we have dined there before we won't be recommending Ah So . We feel totally ripped off."}
{"text":"The sushi here is very fresh and I always enjoy my meal. I would recommend to anyone in the mood for high quality sushi. Prices can be a little high for specialty rolls."}
{"text":"Went to ah so for dinner with some friends around 9. started with a lousy host who was not friendly or Inviting at all. Got sat in a booth and waited for a server. Ask to start with 4 waters and 2 sake bombs with Sapporo. He brings us asahi instead of Sapporo and finally had to ask another server for water. we also wanted to get a bottle of wine and then decided to change our order because it was happy hour. He made us feel guilty saying the bottle was already opened. I am a server as well and know that proper wine presentation is to present the bottle to the table and then open it. From our booth I could see the wine bottle sitting on the bar and it was NOT open. We order our food first with appetizers that came out last and way after our sushi. I finally decided I wanted to speak with a manager just to inform not to complain. I ask the Bartender to get a manager for me and the 'manager' was our server. I had to confront him and I asked him about the sushi which the menu is decieving and I told him about how he made us feel guilty about the wine bottle and he definitely was not manager material. I told him I was a server as well and know how it all goes and im not trying to complain. I return to the table and tell my friends how bad of an experience this has been and they all agree. I was in disbelief that he was a manager. I asked another server if he was really a manager and she told me he was. She claimed it was a crazy night and that he stepped in to help. The restaurant was not busy at all. Atleast 5 servers on and maybe 7 tables in the restaurant. Again just speaking my mind because im a server who gives great service and I expect it in return. He came back to the table and said sorry about everything and next time we come in ge would get us sake bombs on him. The food was okay, service was jot the best.."}
{"text":"Thee WORST EXPERIANCE. We came on Valentines Day knowing we were going to have a long wait, and we did. No problem. Little did we know the wait will continue well after we were seated. We waited a minimum of 15 minutes before someone came and took our drink order. No I'm not exaggerating. We orders drinks, appetizer, and entree all at once. They were way understaffed for such a big dinner day. I will never patronize this establishment again."}
{"text":"Miso soup was not good at all, the sushi was horrible. Will not return to this location"}
{"text":"**sigh**

The flutter in my heart causes me to exhale. 

The presage of the darkening clouds towards the south, and the increasing gusty winds tell me that it is going to be rainy Friday.

It's like Christmas in our household. A momentous event, reminiscent of days past.

I decide to leave work early, and race home. And by race, I mean speeds that are beyond reasonable and prudent. Did I just admit that?

A song in my playlist begins to play. It's Pink's song entitled Perfect. It seems that this may be indicative of the rest of this evening, as soon as I make it home.

We both arrive exactly at the same time. An unusual occurrence in our household. I jump out of my car, and rush to give my beloved a long kiss as if I had just come back from being gone a Month of Sundays, and I just longed to hold her in my arms.

We decide to go out and eat, as we always do on a rainy Friday. We hop in our car, and just drive until we arrive at this Japanese restaurant.

Ah-So is a restaurant chain that does its best to present an elevated dining experience. I am not sure how successful they are at it. However, our initial experience when we arrived was certainly a disappointment.

Upon arrival, the hostess greeted us, and then disappeared for about 5 minutes keeping busy and attempting to organize her reception table in anticipation of the normal dinner rush. Unfortunately, as she kept busy, she neglected to make note of the most important part of her position - acknowledging and seating the customers that happen to be already there and waiting.

The hostess finally returned from her busy work and seated us. There was a family already seated and they occupied all the available seats, except for two that were left. 

It would take another several minutes, before Cindy, our server, would eventually acknowledge the presence of our entire group, and she proceeded to take our order. She started with my wife and I; but I politely indicated that the other family had been there longer, and she needed to take their order first.

Shortly thereafter, she brought the soups to us, and it was dreadful due to the fact that it was cold.

Normally, three strikes equals an out - as in we are walking out! The prolonged wait at the reception desk, the long order taking wait, and now cold soup. We could've just gotten up and walked out of there never to return. Anyhow, the manager came over; probably noticing my displeasure with everything thus far, and attempted to calm down my frustration and irritation with this establishment.

Service recovery is important to any successful business. The quicker you can turn around a customer's negative experience, the greater your chances of winning a customer's heart and mind.

If it weren't for the fact that my heart and mind weren't so involved in just enjoying my wife's company, and attempting to salvage this evening; I would've made sure that they would've known my displeasure up to this point.

Fortunately, our Teppan Chef, Jeremiah, did a spectacular job recovering from the failed initial experience. Although the food wasn't that spectacular, he was able to alter the mood and lighten things up a bit before a revolt started. He engaged everyone in the dining experience, and provided semi-palatable dishes. My wife had the steak and scallops (who orders scallops?). I had the combination steak, chicken, and shrimp. At this point in time, everyone's mood was more jovial and playful, and it was nice to see the kids on the other side of the table enjoying and marveling at Jeremiah's display of cooking prowess.

Cindy was prompt and courteous and at the end of dinner, we were reasonably convinced that this place has some merit and has the potential to provide a decent dining experience. I tipped her and Jeremiah generously.

All in all it was a pleasant experience, and I got to spend some time with my beloved on this wonderfully pleasant evening. From my perspective, I thought it was just simply delightful to spend a rainy Friday with her, and this was going to be the extent of my experience.
 Nonetheless, her Friday's experience wasn't quite over for her - at least not for a few more moments.

As we were exiting, there was an attractive (by most standards) mid-20's blonde coming in the same door. She opened the door, and I made no motion to assist in holding the door open (not out of rudeness, of course, but simply due to focus) until my wife was close enough to it. I quickly stepped in front of her, and held the door open. This has been my custom with my wife forever, to the point that I don't even think anything of it.

To my surprise, that meant a lot to her. She just thought it was so sweet and marvelous that I would take no notice of the younger and seemingly more attractive blonde.

As we continued to walk towards our car, I just turned to her and said...

\"Why would I notice anyone else, when I already have you - and you're Perfect!\""}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour on a Thursday afternoon.  The place was pretty empty, had an odor and the tables were dirty.  I picked the cleanest of the tables and ordered some drinks. The table felt dirty to the touch. Probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Always love the sushi. Quail eggs, yellow tail and lollipop rolls were great. New crew at the bar and John was great"}
{"text":"Ok, this place has improved tremendously. My husband, daughter and I have celebrated my husband's birthday and our anniversary at the teppanyaki tables. So much fun, and we shared a round of drinks with the older couple next to us that were also celebrating their anniversary."}
{"text":"I'm a sushi fan. But not a sushi connoisseur. However, my friend and his wife are both foodies, and are absolutely very picky about their sushi.

We met up for lunch, as I was anxious to learn about their recent safari adventure in South Africa. They took their family and their employees as a reward for having a great fiscal year.

They were being very picky, but I wasn't. After all, it was lunch, and we were just catching up. We chose this place as a matter of convenience, and they were wanting some sushi.

The food was passable. But, the service was atrocious. My friends had asked for fresh wasabi, and our waiter didn't even know that it could be made fresh. Then he dared to mention that it was going to cost extra and if they were willing to pay the extra $6 for it?

That, along with the slow service, and mediocre food; it really was not a pleasant experience for me or them. I was a bit embarrassed for having chosen this venue, but I was unfamiliar with the intermediary area we chose to meet up. A few more miles east, and we would've been in desert ridge, and that would've provided a better selection, than the Norterra area.

In any case, we did enjoy each other's company. And we did get a chance to catch up since the our waiter was incognito most of the time. 

I also learned that if you are willing to pay enough, a safari can actually be an experience as close to home. I thought most safaris were rough experiences. They made it sound like a very very expensive trip to the local zoo! :)

In any case, I definitely will not be back to this establishment. Utterly dreadful!"}
{"text":"ast night, we went to the Peoria location for my nephew's graduation.  We made a 5:30 reservation for dining, but when we go there, we asked for it to be changed to teppanyaki for 6 pm because a member of our party was running late, which the hostess wrote down on the reservation list.  While we were waiting, we sat in the bar for happy hour.  The bartender was working by herself and had exactly one happy hour table card to share with our party of six as well as the rest of the bar.  When I asked her what was in a drink on the happy hour menu, she said she didn't know and gave me one of the beverage menus.  I have never had this happen in over 25 years that a bartender did not know a drink on a happy hour menu.  When our last party member arrived at 6 pm, the manager walked us to a dining seating.  We told him that we asked for teppanyaki and he said that they were all booked up all night long.  No one told us this at 5:30 when we asked for our reservation to be changed and I told him so.  He just repeated that they were all booked up.  So, we sat at a dining seating.  When we sat down, the waitress only gave us four menus for our party of seven.  Really?  You don't have enough menus for everyone at the table have their own menu?  And the restaurant wasn't even that full!  Fine, we shared; we are a close family and can read fast.  Our waitress took our order.  (Just to note, by the time we ordered, there was one teppanyaki table completely empty!)  Everyone, except for me ordered teppanyaki.  I ordered two apps for dinner (I am not a big fan of seasoned rice) and told the waitress that I would like them brought with the rest of the meals, which I have done before at other restaurants without any problem.  The waitress said it that was fine.   Well, the kitchen didn't get that message because I received one of my appetizers about fifteen minutes later.  I again told the waitress I would like my appetizers when the rest of the meals were brought out and she said, \"Well, the kitchen had them ready now.\"  She didn't offer to bring it back and get me a fresh one when the others got their meal.  About fifteen minutes later (yes, 15 minutes!) she brought my other appetizer.  I again told her I wanted it with the other food, and she apologized, but nothing else.  So not to eat alone again, I waited another 15 minutes before the other meals came to eat them.  The teppanyaki main dishes came after 7 pm; we were seated at 6 pm.  That is kind of crazy!  So, I ate one part of my meal alone and the other part of my meal cold and waited an hour for everyone to get their meal.  We spent over $250 dollars at Ah So last night for drinks, dinner, and sushi.  I have never been treated so rudely by a manager and had such poor service.  I will never go to Ah So again.  I will happily spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"This could have been a good restaurant experience but wasn't. My friend and I came to have a fun girls night out. It started out with the hostess who sat us in the walkway close to the bar and away from most of the other tables. We couldn't tell if the waitress Valentina was just really forgetful or just being rude on purpose. We only got 1 menu for 2 people. We were supposed to get the 3 piece happy hour eggrolls but only got 2 eggrolls. The waitress kept asking if my friend wanted refills on her beer but didn't ask me once for refill on my iced tea. Once we ate we asked for boxes she only brought one. As for the food, I had the beef bowl which was so yummy! My friend had the beef teriyaki which she really enjoyed. Also, I had the mango ice cream dumpling dessert but it was mediocre at best. My friend had the triple chocolate mousse cake which I tried and was delicious! So overall not horrible but definitely not great."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been a couple times.  The first time we went it was a Saturday night around 6PM.  They were packed.  We didn't know you could call ahead for reservations. The young lady at the front said the wait could be an hour.  The manager was at the front too and said he would be able to get us in pretty quickly since it was only two of us.  They gave us a pager and we went to the bar for some drinks.  After one round of drinks, probably 15 min or so, we were paged.  We went to our table for teppanyaki.  A lady came by and took our drink order pretty quickly and then our dinner order.  The show was pretty good.  The food was excellent.  Really good fried rice and I love the vegetables.  The filet was cook perfectly and the chicken was flavored well (I think teriyaki) and wasn't too dry.  My only real complaint would be the wait to get your check at the end.  The manager did come by and talk to me to see how my visit was.  He offered me a 10 voucher to come back another time because we had to wait.  That was unnecessary but very nice.  


This past time was for dinner on New Years.  I called days ahead of time and was told they were not taking reservations anymore because they were booked.  On New Years day we were driving by and the place didn't look really busy, so I called again.  This time I was told come on in, they could get us a seat.  Strange, but ok.  When we arrived we were now told it would be an hour wait.  We got our pager and went to the bar.  No big deal, we will get a sushi roll and some drinks.  We had just finished the sushi roll and ordered the sake sampler, when the pager went off.  That was probably only a 30 min wait.  Like last time, we went to our table for teppanyaki.  A lady came by and took our drink order pretty quickly and then our dinner order.  This time the show was just avg at best.  The food was still excellent and that is really all I care about. This time I wanted to try the scallops.  I wanted to do a filet with scallops but that was not on the menu.  The waitress was very accommodating to make that happen for me.  My wife got the chicken.  The steak and chicken were good again, and the scallops were the best I have ever had at a teppanyaki restaurant. 

I really like how they have the bar at the front so you can have a drink, maybe an appetizer and watch some sports while you wait.

I haven't been yet for the happy hour but they look to have some really good deals. This is one of the better teppanyaki restaurants I've been to, and I will be back."}
{"text":"Came in today to celebrate Mother's Day with our family, a party of TWENTY-FIVE! We have been here before and have been provided great service every time. Today however we were amazed by how great Veronica was. I would like to say our waitress Veronica did an excellent job! She had the greatest attitude the entire time we were there. Served us well, was very attentive, and VERY patient with our big party. This restaurant has a great team. Help came in from left and right to make sure we all had our drinks and food. The chef was very entertaining and made sure we had a good time. Food was so DELISH as well. Definitely recommend this place. We of course look forward to making a return. Thank you Ah-So team!"}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times and I finally decided to write this review so hopefully the owner reads it and makes some changes. We are a family of 4 and usually eat out 4-5 nights a week. The last three times we went to Ah-So, we were going to eat at the cook table, they did not look full and there was nobody waiting and the hostess was kind of rude. I said we were 4 and were going to have dinner at the cook table and the only response was \"there is between 1 and 1.5 hours wait\". Not even can I take your name or would you like to go to the bar, nothing. The last three times we walked out and went to Hayashi instead (down the road). 

I do not mind waiting, but at least be nice about it. Please train your employees to be respectful and nice to your costumers. We have spent a lot of money at this place and would like to continue to go for dinner here, but the hostess do not care at all.

When we were lucky enough to eat at the cook table, we had a decent service and the food was good. When eating at the regular dining, the service was ok but the sushi was great. FYI- the Mexican chefs cook better than the Asian chefs."}
{"text":"I love hibachi but this location is pretty bad the food is okay not good but okay but the rice is sour like lemon juice and rice and the sauces aren't up to par with Benihana or any other hibachi places. The lights are messed up and flicker the entire time your eating which is nerve racking and the tables and chairs are shaky. 

Also when i ordered food to go on a wednesday afternoon and came to pick it up they said they had no bags so I had to carry out containers of foods and soups by hand."}
{"text":"New management came in to change things for the worst. We were regulars there and always loved the place until now. We are never going back because of how bad the manager named Seth treated us. We ordered two \"Shrimp tempura\" rolls and what they did was make ONE roll, split in in half and charge us for TWO. When we complained, Seth (the manager) showed nothing but rudeness, bad hospitality and bad language. He said that's the way they make rolls now and he won't change it. All I said was \"Well thank you for letting us know just so we don't bother to come back\""}
{"text":"We went there for luncheon with work and I like the lunch prices. The grille is always fun and it was a lot of coworkers first time so it made it fun. It is too expensive to go in the evening. This place is saved for special occasions."}
{"text":"Good food, but their service is apathetic and neglectful at best when they're really busy. Hostesses are so disorganized, and ended up sitting at a table and forgotten, and watched the same happen to a nearby group of people."}
{"text":"Stopped by for happy hour!! Was seated right away and our food came quick. Ordered four different rolls they were all so fresh and delicious. I never order wings here but I tried them today. Excellent!! The perfect amount and sweet and spicy.  Not only was the quality amazing so was the happy hour prices!"}
{"text":"Good Sushi, just wish the prices were a little lower!"}
{"text":"Went once and we'll never go back.  Decor was weird, chinese/japenese and then NFL helmets and footgames on everywhere.  Sushi was not good and overpriced.  We also had calarmari that tasted like the batter on Burger King Onion Rings, Disgusting!!  Weird restaurant, overpriced, and not good.  Your better off at any other restaurant at Happy Valley except this one."}
{"text":"So we come from California where there is a lot of sushi to choose from and it is my favorite food so I have been searching for good sushi here this is not the place.

Anyways the small amount of fish in my roll and the horrible service did not satisfy my craving and I will never go back it was like a sushi bar that was trying to be a dance club and the waiters were all very distracted by that. They never refilled our drinks anyways I finally found the perfect sushi place ill write a review for them later :)"}
{"text":"We went for happy hour, the food was ok- happy hour food. The menu had a decent selection. The rolls were tasty. The thing that annoyed me was the ambiance. This place would have so much more going for it if they just updated it and made it a little cozier. The high tops are very uninviting, the lighting is off, it's too cold, bad music, just a little awkward and uninviting..."}
{"text":"Waited a bit because hostess was waiting on a large reservation. Once sat noticed restaurant is not very clean . There was a taller gentleman who seemed to be in charge of bossing everyone around . Our roll came up and instead of bringing it to us he pushed it aside and waited for some else to bring it. The chef was great very entertaining. Kicker there where 7 of us one of those 7 was a newborn and 2 children under the age of 3 and you bet they charged us 37.00 for gratuity waitress was not worth it , chef was. Place really needs a deep cleaning walls are gross floors caked with food. I give the chef 5 starts staff and restaurant lucky on a 3"}
{"text":"Dammit. I thought I found a hidden gem, and it turns out to be a chain. WHatever...

This place has it all for the Japanese lover in you. Sushi, outdoors dining, hibachi if you're so inclined, and about 1700 televisions throughout the dining room. It sort of feels like a gymnasium - it's massiveness is somewhat - well - massive.

Anyway, on to the food. Ate here twice during a visit to Phoenix for work. The fish was (generally) very fresh and very good. We did order some tuna that was not quite right looking, and since I'm flying tomorrow for 4 hours, I decided it wasn't worth the risk.

Typical sushi / Hibachi fare, and it stands out in a massive planned retail community stuffed full with Olive Garden, Red Robin, Applebees, P.F. Changs, etc. You get the idea. No original food to be found in this -- dare I say it -- barren wasteland of retail blahness. It's kind of like being in the desert. Oh wait....

Anyway, good sushi, good service, kind of weird on the atmosphere scale - really quite barren inside. The weather was awesome, so  we sat outside both times.

I will repeat, but only because the alternatives are corporate deep fried cardboard."}
{"text":"Great food & service!!  Always friendly and the sushi is always awesome in terms of taste, freshness and variety! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the chef was great. The hostess and the waiter were terrible!"}
{"text":"Pricey and boring. Everything tasted the same for crying out loud."}
{"text":"On a slower Tuesday night we have been sitting here without a server for 10-15 minutes.  Not sure why but there seems to be a lack of care in serving anyone.  So far we're at a 1 and unfortunately it could go lower based on what our experience has been so far.  We've complained to the hostess who nicely took our drink order but still no server.

Update:  we left and went to PF Changs where the service was 100x better."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in Arizona.  We like to sit at the bar and have some drinks along with some great food!  The garlic edamame is the best edamame I have ever eaten in my life.  The waitress at the bar is great and always remembers us and what our usual order is.  This place is also great for dates and it isn't weird if you are dressed up or in casual clothes.  We go here at least once a month to just chill and eat great food!"}
{"text":"Ah-so needs a breakdown of what they're all about, so here it is:

Location: Great! Pretty much the only place to get a variety of sushi in Norterra/Happy Valley.

Restaurant: Different. It's nice inside, but a little strange with the combination of football helmets and ancient Japanese decor. It's like Applebees & P.F. Changs got together and had a baby... a very ugly one.

Food: Amazing! The food nothing to complain about when it comes to taste. I've had a few different sushi rolls and both types of calamari. All of it was delicious. 

Service: Terrible. This is where Ah-So fails big time. The service when you walk in isn't very welcoming as you're greeted by an either flustered or snooty hostess. No smiles with \"Hello, how are you?\", just a blank stare, then a smirk with \"How many?\". If you're lucky, you may hear a \"Welcome to Ah-so\" while she's staring down at the seating chart. I like what Jessica H. says: \"...it was like we were inconveniencing them, even though there were many many empty tables.\" So true Jessica!

The waiting area for tables is super small, but that's not really the problem. The problem is WHY we're waiting. Both times I've gone, we've waited for 10-15 minutes when there are at least 5 tables out there with no-one sitting at them, and another 2 or 3 tall tables in the bar area (which is fine for 4 college students). Some have dirty dishes and some are ready to be seated at. However, we all end up sitting there (or standing) waiting and waiting. Mind you, this is just weeknights that we're going, I haven't been brave enough to try a weekend meal there.

When we're finally seated, the fun had only begun. The wait for food is painfully long sometimes. The first time they screwed up my order, which was fine because they ended up giving me the extra calamari for free. But the second time we went I ordered the Vegas roll, it was a good 5-10 minutes before mine came out. Meanwhile, everyone else at the table had already received and finish theirs. Not a good feeling when everyone is waiting for you to finish eating because you're food came out so late.

The only good thing about the service was the last waitress we had was actually quick, nice and somewhat decent. 

If I were you, I would take the extra couple minutes and drive to Koi in Arrowhead, or even Sushi Brokers in Scottsdale. If you don't care for sushi and want the steak, just go somewhere else in Norterra. There's definitely plenty of other restaurants with MUCH better service (like Mellow Mushroom or Buffalo Wild Wings)."}
{"text":"I wanted to go to a teppanyaki style Japanese restaurant for my birthday so my husband chose Ah-So Sushi & Steak in Goodyear, AZ. First of all the prices of the dinners were expensive. The physical plant was just okay. You have a view of the parking lot. Also, I felt our chef was not professional because he was inquiring as to people's professions and making inappropriate comments. And finally, the food was so bad that none of us in my party could eat it. We all left hungry. The soup tasted like dishwater. The lettuce in the little salad was wilted. And the shrimp that I ordered as my main course was inedible! The shrimp was so tough that you could barely chew it. The vegetables that were served with the meal were soggy and tasteless. The rice was wet, hard and sticky. The waitress didn't seem shocked in the least that none of us had eaten our meals. She merely asked if we wanted containers for our food and when we responded no, she just brought us our check. This is truly the worst restaurant meal that I have had in my entire life! Save yourselves, people. Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My husband and I live close and come at least once a week..prices are great and so is the food! CUSTOMER service is excellent..being an owner of a business I know how important it is."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant again and now I see why there were bad reviews before. I must of had a lucky previous experience. However, this time we went it was not a very good experience at all. We went on Saturday night (around 6pm, so it wasn't busy at all). We were seated right away in the dining area. We sat down and we waited, and we waited for a server to even look at us. Oh wait, there were SEVERAL servers looking at us, all gathered at the bar. Not sure 'what' they were serving, but there were 5 of them just talking. I'm assuming it was waiters for the teppanyaki?? Regardless, it was annoying. We even had to witness a waiter or bus boy or someone picking up one of the hostess' (who might I add, was wearing a skirt). Very classy Ah-So. Where were the grown ups in this place?! 

So after 7 minutes of waiting. May not seem like a long time, but you need to be greeted within in 1-2 min. tops in my book (or at least told 'we'll be with you in a moment). We finally get a waiter come up to us and ask 'Have you been waited on?'. Really? You don't know?! We are staring into the wide open restaurant with a glazed look on our faces with menus closed (waiting to order) and no drinks. No...we have not been waited on. Bitter? Yes, just a little, but I was just so sick of bad customer service this topped the cake.

The waiter we finally got was nice enough, but the food this time was sub-par.  Maybe that is because we weren't drinking sake bombers this time. :o) And the rolls came out a minute after the appetizer--my biggest pet peeve, I like to enjoy my appetizer first. Anyway, the California roll I had seemed warm and tasted very bland. However, one of the pieces of the shrimp roll I snagged  from my husband, was good.  But my husband wasn't totally sold on the other roll he had as well (I forgot which one...salmon I think). And the Gyoza we had as an appetizer was okay.

Overall, I was disappointed with this dining experience."}
{"text":"We walked in and this place definitely deserves to have $$$ instead of $$ because for one person it's 25 to 30 dollars so 2 people is around 60-70 dollars, they need to change their evaluation. It's the same price range as Benihana"}
{"text":"I just took my daughter here after her first week of this school year because she wanted sushi and this place is on the way home. Luckily they do not close in the \"in-between\" time and there wasn't many people here yet because it was just before happy hour. 

They do have a happy hour, literally an hour, from 5pm-6pm.

The sushi was up to par in flavor, but the philly roll (daughter picked) had some of the tiniest slivers of salmon. It had more cream cheese than salmon. We also got the Kim #2 roll per the suggestion of Erica, our \"server\". It was decent, but I am pretty sure that it is her \"favorite\" because it is $15. 

Speaking of our server. It took her so long to come to the table the first time that we almost left then. She was talking to one of the guys behind the bar and once they were at a story pausing part she graced us with her presence. 

Aldon (?) the busser was more helpful than our server. He would probably make a better server.

I haven't been here in many years and the decor has changed totally since the last time I was here and it looks like someone trying to be hip and trendy and trying really hard to look the part. Not sure if I will be back."}
{"text":"This year's winner for strangest restaurant lay out goes to Ah So !  Here is the system they used to decorate ..take one elongated triangle of a room, place  the sushi bar and the bar on the long solid wall. Place teppanki tables in the very back of triangle room . Then place rows of table throughout the rest of the place. And don't even think about a actual bar area for patrons drinking. Drinking can only happen a the actual bar with stools.  Then place for large screen TVS for random sport events. We just kept saying isn't this weird?
This is what the designing whizzes at Ah So came up with .  I hope they didn't actually pay  anyone to come up with this plan for them . The interior space just reeks of openness without any allotted spaces. Our table felt like we were in the hallway of the restaurant if they had had a hallway.  
Luckily  our server was really wonderful and spot on ..his attitude made us feel welcomed  and served. Food was decent not earthshaking but better than a couple others we have tasted lately.
Tako salad was tasty just wish we had more octopus in it. Daughter loved her tuna, salmon and red snapper sushi .  Our caterpillar roll and Las Vegas roll were nicely done ."}
{"text":"Good food but I called to make a reservation and they said they don't take reservations and then I got to the hostess stand and they had a book of reservations on the hostess stand. I asked her if she could bump us up the list because of this inconvenience but I am not in the process of waiting at least 45 minutes while people with reservations walk right past us."}
{"text":"The rudest most disappointing customer service! Place was completely empty, which I should've known something when I walked in but first time I'll give it a try... Well the floors are filthy, the plates were dirty and hibachi grill still had food residue sitting on it. Health board should probably look into giving this place a shakedown. Needless to say after witnessing this I gladly grabbed my family, paid for our bottled waters and got out of there... Thanks but I'll pass on the e-coli!"}
{"text":"We love the happy hour sushi! Shrimp tempura rolls for just 5 bucks! Their sushi is great!! We go here maybe two or three times a month. Only reason for three stars is their teppenyaki, it's really over priced for the amount of food they give you.. Lol it's kind of a rip off.. Expect to spend at least 25 or more for just one person! But other than that great place!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment! We usually go here for Teppan-Yaki but were told they didn't have enough people tonight when we got there and we have to wait 30 to 45 minutes. We were encouraged to order the same food off the menu but not Tappenyaki style. The quality of the food was nowhere near as good as when it's made fresh, the shrimp is rubbery, The chicken was dry, everything was oversalted and management didn't care. The best thing about the night was the calamari.even the soup and salad that came before dinner was flavorless and room temperature. 
This is not in the AHSO we have been coming to for years and we would be hard-pressed to return"}
{"text":"I came here a couple of weeks ago with a friend for lunch and didn't realize it was like Benihana's back home. We got some rolls to share (some kind of deep fried dragon roll and a special shrimp roll they had that day with shrimp tempura, crab and unagi), both of which were pretty good.

We also ordered the Tepenyaki grill and it was fun to see the chef cook it for us on the grill. You get your choice of meat, and they cook it on the tabletop with fried rice and seasonal veggies, which I liked bc usually you get white rice and some brocoli with carrots. They also gave us these two dipping sauces which were pretty tasty. You get some soup with it as well (not miso). 

The only thing I didn't like was that it was lunchtime, but not busy at all, yet  service was slow. They might have had maybe 4 other customers, but it took almost 10 min to get water, then another 10 to take our order and then the grill had to heat up, so it was like a 30 min wait before we got to actually eat. At least the rolls came out fairly quickly. I would've liked to have seen some bento box options on the menu too."}
{"text":"I had pretty low expectations for this place after seeing the reviews on Yelp for all locations. We came here with friends because we wanted something interactive with the Teppanyaki. I thought the food was good-- it always tastes good to me fresh off the grill. The cooks were skilled and gun to watch. Only downside is that the location wasn't particularly active for a weekend night."}
{"text":"Wonderful Teppan Dining, best in the west valley by far. I love that they have calamari on their menu for a combo option with the Teppan dining. Services is good, steak is done to perfection here. Fresh ingredients done right for dinner and a show. Love it."}
{"text":"Put some freakin purse hooks in the girls restroom! Get better beer on tap and don't let your lady bartenders look frumpy."}
{"text":"The quality of the food was only surpassed by the exceptional service! Our teppanyki chef, Gabriel, was absolutely delightful! How does one accomplish such talented technique and exquisite flavors, all while entertaining two insatiable children?? Beautiful!
Our waiter, Chase, was attentive and never left us hanging. Awesome service to say the least. Best birthday dinner I could have hoped for for my amazing husband!"}
{"text":"We love Ah-So. We have been coming here for years and always sit at the sushi bar. The chef's know us by name and immediately make the things we love, and they will try out their new creations on us. My daughter even has her own special roll that they make for her. We love this place!"}
{"text":"I love AhSo's best the food is better at the Peoria location."}
{"text":"We used to dig this place but a few months ago we made a reservation for a teppanyaki table and were told \"you're in the book!\" (meaning their reservation book).  When we arrived we were NOT in the book.  Ok, errors happen and we were ok with it.  It took an extra 20 minutes to fit us in and the meal was fine.  This past week we made another reservation and were told \"you're in the book!\" I confirmed that this was true based on what happened previously and explained our previous experience to him.  No problems, we're in, he said.  We showed up.  No reservation in the book.  We were told we would need to wait 20 min!  Minimal apology.  No offering of an appetizer or drink... Just told to wait.  The manager didn't even seem to care and he was pretty smug as well.  We left and they've lost our business.  Simple customer service is all they needed along with addressing a system improvement and they failed.  From other reviews it seems there's been a management change but whatever happened to this place is unfortunate."}
{"text":"This was a surprisingly nice sushi place. The food was great, the wait staff was very helpful and attentive, and the prices were decent for the quality. The only reason I would not give them 5 stars is that the specialty drink selection was pretty lousy, and the prices didn't exactly match the quality. I'm not saying the sushi was bad, but I've just had better sushi at similar prices. The sushi selection is actually very good, but the value is not the best. I would drfinitely come here again, and I hope they improve their drink selection."}
{"text":"Family from out of town for Thanksgiving - wanted Sushi and a show for the kids. I have been to the other Ah-So's in town and was not too impressed. So thought we would try this one as it is newer and in a \"hipper\" place.

Called and made reservations for 13... we arrived on time only to find that they had taken a teppanyaki table for 10 (which they now tell us was the biggest size... would have been nice to have been told this when making reservations) -- and they have crammed 13 seats around it. Luckily we had an infant - so one seat was taken and a highchair brought. Made some elbow room - but still cramped.

The food and sushi was just so-so. Nothing really spectacular. The reason that they are getting 4 instead of 2 stars was the Teppanyaki Chef - he saved the day. From the general chit-chat, to the cool tricks he did. He even had some tricks that I had never seen before. Kept the kids and the family from out of town entertained... which is exactly what we needed.

Overall: Food - had better; Experience/Chef - was awesome.

TIP: Teppanyaki tables only hold 10 people (adults) - so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"We have been going to Ah So for years and have never had a bad experience.  The sushi is always fresh and tastes great.  The teppanyaki tables are always fun and they give you too much food.  

Stop on by and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Found a bug in my water. Yuk!  Also, the employees take their break in the main dining hall at the back of the restaurant. Strange and distracting. Sushi was okay.  Other members of our party did teppanyaki and the chef seemed bored.  We won't be back again. I wish I checked the reviews on Yelp before coming here!"}
{"text":"Always in the pursuit of cheap drinks, my beau and I picked Ah-So to celebrate the end of the semester. Happy hour fit in perfectly with my night class schedule so away we went! 

The place has flat screen on the walls, loud music bumping, and strong drinks but is not very popular for some reason. I'm really not sure why this place was empty since it really set the party vibe well. 

We ordered our whole meal and about six drinks off of the happy hour menu. I liked all the sushi, and the edamame specifically was fantastic. 

My Long Island was a little too strong, and my beau ordered me a celebratory Cosmo (my first one). Apparently, it didn't taste right, but I wouldn't really know the difference. 

Overall, a decent experience that I would gladly repeat sometime soon."}

{"text":"Teerible rude hostesses. Put ur name on the wait list told us it'd be an hour or more. Back in 40 minutes and wanted us to wait another 30 minutes and were rude about it. Only 1 chef working yet a full waiting area. Terribly under staffed. Not sure of the food quality but the help sucks!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fuck this place. I show up with one other person to enjoy a bday dinner at the grill and I'm told that I cannot be seated at the grill because they have reservations for a party of 17. The reservation was for 7pm...it was 7:20 and nobody had shown up. We sat at a table and ordered. We ate our food and left around 9pm. Not a single person from said reservation ever showed and they didn't seat anyone at the grill all night, even with room for 60 people at the grill. I will never eat here again due to poor business management. Beer wasn't really cold or tasty, but food and service was good. I give one star because it won't let me rate any lower."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for a friends birthday, group of 9. Waitress was nice when she was around which was hardly ever. People from our table had to go up to the bar to get drinks. Food came out at all different times. At the end of the night after waiting forever to get our bill I saw why...18% gratuity included. No wonder...won't ever come back here."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now, each visit spaced about 7 months apart. I feel the need to finally review the place.

First visit:  Was excited to try the place out.  Went around the grand opening.  We ate at the bar since we planned on downing some drinks.  Well as the bartender sets my drink in front of me, he knocks it down.  It spilled all over my shirt and lap then into my purse. It was a SERIOUS spill.  My phone and everything in my purse was sticky or ruined. He apologized then comped the one drink...to top it off the sushi sucked. 

Second visit:  Yes i decided to give them another try because sometimes new places need a couple months to run smooth and iron out the kinks, or sometimes they just have an off night cuz someone didn't show up... Well in this case, Sushi still sucked.  And service was still bad.

Third time:  I don't know why we came but we did.  Service was great this time.  I loved my waitress she was awesome.  Sushi still sucked.  Bad. But the sake bombers were cheap! so they get an extra star for that and for my great server.  

Yes I will be back.  Only for happy hour and Sake Bombers."}
{"text":"Poor customer service had to go find a server. Cok was not very entertaining. Took my parents here for their first visit wish I had taken them to Bell Location."}
{"text":"This place, located in Norterra, is a bit spendy. They have good sushi, and have the typical fry chef's and have a nice atmosphere. 

I would HIGHLY recommend a late dinner there, their happy hour begins at 9pm, if you can hold out until then it's a really good deal on sushi and drinks.

For the price there are many options in Norterra for dining but I believe this is the only sushi spot. 

Barkeep and receptionist were very friendly."}
{"text":"This restaurant says they don't take reservations, but will still take your name and number.  (isn't that a reservation) anyway it took 1 1/2 hours until we got seated. Seriously, it was ridiculous and totally not worth it. The vegetarian in the group got the same amount of vegetables as everyone else, the lobster was totally over-cooked and the soup was weak and the salad tiny. Find another restaurant to take your friends. I was so embarrassed that I had suggested this place and would never recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Based on the other reviews, it seems my girlfriends and I have been lucky whenever we stop in for dinner/happy hour. Our waitresses (especially today - I wish I got her name) are very sweet and accommodating. I don't eat pork, and they always substitute and replace menu items to make sure I can order what I want. This location's set-up is better than the one on 61st (larger and with music) so we always come here. 

To be honest, I'm a Yen junkie (their happy hour sucked me in)...  but whenever me and the girls want to switch it up, we always drop by Ah-So and enjoy ourselves."}
{"text":"Well I guess I failed my self by not checking yelp.  This place is not very good at all the miso soup was so salty none of us finished even half the soup .and the dinner just continued from there. First time ever I've not finished my sushi we ordered 6 different rolls all of wich had some type of issue . My daughter ordered there steak and chicken dinner . Also not finished . Total bill just under a the 100 bucks for someone that works really hard for his money it was tuff to shell it out with a tip for service that was sub par . I don't mind spending on good food and service actually I enjoy it . There's places that will literally make you feel great about your dinning experience . This is not one of them."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place around Goodyear. And I am quite the sushi lover. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We have always loved the other two AZ locations, however, have now tried this location for the 5th time and are continually disappointed. The service is slow, the sushi does not appear to be fresh and is often served warm. When we told our server yesterday that sushi did not seem fresh she told us that their sushi is always fresh, it is probably because it is hot out side! Really? This is a great location and we are sad to say that we will not be returning, they need to take some lessons on service from the other two locations in the valley!"}
{"text":"My review is specifically for the Sushi Bar at the Happy Valley location. If you love sushi make sure to go and sit with Hiro at the bar. I've eaten at some of the best places in the country and he is truly a master of his craft. I have to go pretty far out of my way to go there but the drive is always worth it."}
{"text":"Came in the other day and had a great time! All the workers were just full of energy and really tended to whatever we needed. The sushi BY FAR is best in the area, Tyler and Johnny really knows what they're doing and recommended lots of great rolls! We ordered a large variety of sashimi and they made it look so nice! :) 

Had an amazing time and can't wait to come back next week! 

Don't let all the negative reviews fool you this place is definitely a diamond in the desert!"}
{"text":"GREAT HAPPY HOUR SPOT!!

I really love the atmosphere at this ahso. The layout is nice and open compared to other locations. 

The happy hour menu is the main reason I visit this place so often. They have a great selection for both food and drinks. 

The staff here is always super friendly and seem like they enjoy being there. 

I really wish they didn't close so early during the week, sometimes i have to race here from work to get in before they close."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat sushi!!

I am really happy that they are now open until 2AM! Happy Hour starts at 10PM and goes until 2AM! Very nice!

You will be happy with the happy hour menus here! Everyone else including me is... Lots of great selections!

The atmosphere here is very entertaining! Lots of eye candy fellas! They have a DJ start spinning up best and hip hits when happy hour starts. 

Teppanyaki Grills are amazing here! They have about 8 of them here! 

Love this place!"}
{"text":"We religiously love Ah-So and frequent it once every few months. We have been to several glendale locations and this one by far is the WORST we've been to. Everything looks fantastic but tastes otherwise. 

To start...we were given a sushi menu with previous visitors' food stained on the paper and it had already been written and scribbled on. 

We ordered Edamame as an app...decent. Miso was great, not hot. The Filet Mignon was tender and cooked to our liking however the flavor was of char. The Ceviche Roll was by FAR one of the best rolls I have ever had...I am very very pleased with the. The Mussels were aggressive, California roll was good. 

I have to say the worst part of the meal was the rice which tasted like cardboard...I didn't even eat it :( 

Please cook the broccoli next time, It was crunchy. 

Our waiter Dylan was super friendly and kind. He was quick to put in our order and our food came out pretty quickly. Unfortunately halfway through our meal, we had to get up from the table to ask for a refill on soda because about 5-6 waiters were having a POW WOW in the corner....photo provided. Minus the girl who is actually working on the register, I think also Dylan. Put some effort into the food and maybe we'll come back. It's unfortunate because this is the closest location to our house"}
{"text":"I'll start from the beginning... When this place is busy (for some unknown reason) the parking is a nightmare due to the lack of space and the inexperienced drivers. The absolute WORST thing was me witnessing the valet girl stalling someone's car. I really couldn't help but laugh - why would you be valeting cars if you didn't know how to drive stick?!

When you walk in everything is kind of new and trendy looking. I noticed a lot of younger people like to go here so if that's not your crowd then this isn't where you want to be after 7pm. I personally don't like \"trendy-young-and-cool\" sushi spots. I've only gone for dinner time so I can't speak for what it's like at lunch. 

The few times I've been here the sushi wasn't all that great - and I feel I'm a pretty good judge when it comes to the sushi department. I try to give new places a chance so I've been here maybe 3 times. Sushi still wasn't all that, our service always left something to be desired, and the last straw....

I COULD NOT BELIEVE after mediocre borderline poor service, our waitress had THE NERVE to hand me our bill and circle the suggested tip she wrote down. Seriously? I always tip my servers well and accordingly, and a whole lot more when the service is excellent. I rounded out my bill to the next dollar and will never come back here again."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant for about the 5th time in the past 2-3 months.  We found a new, much less inspiring menu.  We opted to sit at the bar, something we've never done and will never, ever do again.  Not even sure we will return due to the poor, slow service and the complete attitude from the brunette, female bartender behind the bar.  She gave the service EVERY patron should receive to all the single men that were there and who came in after.  Any couples at the bar were pretty much ignored or pawned off to the bearded guy also behind the bar.  The couple sitting next to us shared the same sentiment.  We ordered 2 rolls, the bar and restaurant were about 60% full  and it took almost 25 minutes to get them served!  We are very good tippers and always return to places we feel provide good service.  We both left so annoyed with the behavior of the female bartender that we truly do not want to return.  That and the new menu which is very limited left us feeling like we need to go back to the sushi places in Scottsdale and say so long, farewell to Ah-So Sushi."}
{"text":"Wanted to give this place another shot but the service is just downright awful here. Felt bad for our waitress because she looked so overworked and stressed. Our food took about 45 min to come out. The food is just okay and the entrees are super expensive. Definitely not worth the money. Don't waste your time going here. There are much better sushi places."}
{"text":"Their Vegas Rolls are the best I've had!! Pretty quick service but they do need to hire some new waitresses because they can be rude at times but there are a couple that are the greatest and they know who they are!!"}
{"text":"I love this Ah-So! I've only had their sushi, not any cooked food off the menu (besides appetizers). Sushi is consistently delicious and fresh. We sit at the sushi bar, which is always fun and we get great service. Tyler makes an awesome yellowtail hand roll with avocado; all their hand rolls are so good (yellowtail, salmon, spicy tuna...) but that's my favorite. As for regular sushi rolls, I love the crazy yellowtail roll which is not on the sushi menu, but it's been on the special board for awhile now. As for appetizers, I've had the shrimp and veggie tempura as well as the shumai, both are very good. 
Later on Friday and Saturday nights they turn up the music and the bar gets crowded, fun for a late dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"Kim Samurai is the man! I am a regular to this place because of the great experience and great food this man makes for me. I am very picky about sushi because I'm afraid of getting sick. In the west side this is the place I trust and love."}
{"text":"I came here as part of my \"movie night\" outing and I really enjoyed.  The service was quite good the server was always very attentive and the sushi was good.  We had 4 different kinds and they ranged from REALLY good to tastes good.  

Considering the size of the place, the parking was a bit \"tricky\" as I read, but all in all it was a really good experience."}
{"text":"Food = Excellent.
Service = Poor Poor Poor.

Sushi and steak are easy to make. I eat out to be served and that is where AhSo falls Oh So Short."}
{"text":"Really friendly service so that's a perk but the food was alright nothing spectacular. I ordered the chicken and shrimp. It came with miso soup and a side salad. The shrimp had some flavor the chicken and rice had none until I drenched them in the sauces they give you. I probably wouldn't want to come back here when I visit AZ again."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere..but make sure you pack your lunch before you go there cuz the food sucks. Kinda pricey too."}
{"text":"Ah-So Sushi & Steak is really a 2.5 star rating but only because my son loves the show the Chefs put on at your Teppanyaki grills.  If it was for my son giving you guys props this would be a 1 star rating. 

Restaurant ~ yes this place is laid out weird, may be it's due to the location.  It's sort of a triangle-ish shape with the bar placed at the front door, the sushi bar away from the regular bar, which doesn't make sense, and then regular dinning to fill the triangle with the teppanyaki grills at the far end.  I looks a little worn which is surprising since this place is fairly new.

Service ~ this is where they could use some help. It's hit and miss depending on where you sit and which server you get. My last visit was at the sushi bar and the service was a complete miss. She gave my order to the one sushi chef that was the busiest, so I waited and chatted with the other two sushi blokes while waiting for the first chef to find my order. Why not let he pencil something new? But no sir, we need to find your original order so we don't make you two. (what!)  I reached for my glass of H2O and my glass was sticky! GROSS! I was going to ask for a manager but that's when my server apparently got lost somewhere in the triangle vortex of this place and did not see her again for 15 mins..

Food ~ Sushi menu is very plain with only a few options so I ordered their  special sushi roll with spicy scallops on top of a California roll and some Hamachi sashimi.  The sashimi was ok, it didn't look very good but there was not fishy smell so I ate it.  Their sushi roll was crazy funny looking. It was not cut even at all, fell apart and the spicy scallops were mushy.  Yuck! I could not eat it.  

When we eat their teppanyaki grill, it's also a hit and miss depending on the cook your get.

Over all ~ Meh, I've experienced much better."}
{"text":"Tyler was such an awesome sushi chef. He was so nice and talkative, he even helped entertain our cranky daughter. He also made a point to make sure our server came over and we got the happy hour prices. Will definitely be coming back and sitting at the sushi bar again."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and service was great. We did a last minute dinner for my daughters birthday party. They were able to seat us quickly, provide recommendations of food selection to five 12 year olds and did a wonderful job with writing out happy birthday on the dessert plate. BTW, their chocolate moose is amazing."}
{"text":"I was out with my husband on a Monday night for dinner and a movie.  We were both craving some teppanyaki cooking and this place was conveniently near the movie theater.  It was early in the evening so not busy at all when we arrived.  Service was okay, nothing super exceptional, probably a 6 out of 10.  The hostess seated us at the grill table promptly.  The server was also prompt in taking our orders.  Got a shrimp tempura roll as an appetizer.  Really good!  We were then served the soup and salad that come with the teppan entries.  Just okay.  The soup is a clear broth, maybe miso?  The salad is dressed with a teryaki-like dressing.  We quickly polished those off and waited a bit for the 'cooking show'.  If you frequent teppanyaki places, you know that you usually have to wait for awhile to see if the rest of the grill seats will fill up with customers before the chef comes out.  We didn't have to wait long, even though only 2 other people showed up at the table.  The chef was okay.  I get the feeling that they put the newly trained chefs out on slower nights...but he did a fine job.  I ordered steak and scallops.  Hubby ordered steak and chicken.   We both agreed the scallops and chicken were the best meats of the meal.  I'll likely choose another meat instead of steak next time.  We also both LOVE that pink sauce that comes on the side.  So good!

Other things to note:  It is DARK in there and fashioned to be a tad upscale.  I would not recommend it for young children, though they do offer a children's menu (consisting of kid portions of choice of meat, rice, and veggie).  Also, if you think the chef did a good job and gave you a nice show, then I suggest tipping at least a buck or two per person in your party.  They are entertainers as well as cooks, after all, and work on a very HOT stage!"}
{"text":"i will stick to Benihana's or the location in Goodyear.
Our server was awesome but the cook and the place itself was ehhh.
and i agree with other yelpers very disorganized. the food isnt the best either.
My biggest dissapointment is how they let random people from the street into the restrooms and they are disgusting! i avoided even going in once the person in front of me opened the door."}
{"text":"Have heard some pretty good things about the place, was excited to go and try the food. The place was packed when we got there. Decided on the sushi bar, service was slow, but the waitress made sure that our needs were met. The fish didn't look very fresh, sushi was very mediocre. To top off this very substandard experience, our california roll had a hair in it. I don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"Ok, the food isn't bad.  I had a few sushi rolls and the tuna tartar.  Not bad.  Not great.  But the service.  THE WORST I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED!!!!  The hostess sat us and said our waitress would be with us soon.  Our waitress came.  Not a smile, how are you, nothing.  Not even a Happy Fathers Day for my husband.  She took our order.  Brought the entree 5 minutes before the appetizer.  Just set the stuff on our table and left.  Never came back to check on us.  When she dropped the bill off, she squeaked or something, but not once did she say anything that was even remotely audible.  I was actually scared of her.  I didn't ask her for anything.  The one item I did need, I hunted down another (not as scary, but still not friendly) waiter.  He got it and stiffly walked away as well.  I am not sure if it was because we brought a kid with us or what, but I felt very unwelcome in this establishment."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to an Ah-So restaurant and went with a party of 9 for the Teppanyaki style show. If you've been to places like Benihana, you'll probably be disappointed as I was. Not much of a show. The standard egg tricks and that was about it.

I had the Japanese Lettuce Wraps, Samurai Combo and Filet & Scallops. The lettuce wraps were quite good, The scallops mediocre. Scallops were cooked longer than I would have liked. The Filet was very tender and I liked to seasoning they used.

Atmosphere wasn't as cozy and private as you'd find at a Benihana. Price/value ratio was a bit high in my opinion.

Overall, not bad but after living in Japan for two years, not a restaurant I'd go out of my way to get back to."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in the removal of Reverse Happy Hour. AHSO is a place that we like to regularly go to for dinner and drinks especially when my husband1 and I both work long late days. The bar tenders are losing money and the restaurant is cleared out ALREADY. Please bring this back for us and so many others!!!"}
{"text":"The fish was fresh enough but the spicy crab roll was all heat.  Gyoza seemed overdone and the edamame was bland.  Service was good if you don't count the servers standing around the teppanyaki table chatting away."}
{"text":"Reading the other 50 plus reviews, I thought to myself, this place has had some very critical guests....

.....NaCl anyone?  Ordered the $15 lunch of steak and shrimp.  Ordered steak medium rare, was well done and uber salty.  The four quarter sized shrimpies were salty and chewy.  BOO.  Fried rice was salty too.  Food must have sat awaiting the server for some time as the temperature was luke.

Service mirrors  what was described in the other reviews.  Hostess demeanor is cavalier.  Server was quite behind and never followed up with us or asked how the food tasted.  

I'd describe the food like a frozen bag of Birds Eye brand stir fry veggies with overcooked steak and shrimp."}
{"text":"Have visited this place every year for the past 10 or so years when in Peoria for Spring training baseball.  We usually have a group at the Teppanyaki tables.  I've never bothered to Yelp it before, but we have always had decent service, food, etc.  It has been getting run down a bit the past few years, but we always have fun.  Before I booked a reservation here last week, I decided to read some of the current reviews.  Yikes!  I almost didn't book it with all of the 1 star reviews.  However, its kind of a tradition with my group, so we decided to go anyway.  And now I feel like have have to review it to say what a great time we had!  They took a reservation, which is something right there for Peoria during spring training.  We had a very courteous, helpful server and our Teppan chef was great....very friendly and entertaining.  Our table was even visited once during the evening by a manager asking how we were doing and if everything was ok.  I think we covered just about everything you could order at the teppan tables...filet, shrimp, calamari, chicken, steak....and we all agreed that the food was great.  So, I don't know if it depends on the night or the employees or what, but my experience was definitely a good one and I felt like the people definitely wanted to please us."}
{"text":"The teppanyaki tables are good entertainment if you are taking the kids. The food is good but not great although I do dream about those sauces that accompany the food. So good. You will definitely feel like you are being pushed out so they can turnover your seat for the next group. I understand but they could take a bit of a softer approach. No kids menu but my daughter will eat the chicken katsu."}
{"text":"Updating to my last review. Since my last bad 1 star review that manager Daniel reached out to me to apologize for the experience and ensure it did not happen again. He listened and addressed my concerns which was very appreciated and allowed me to give it another chance. 

I went their today with my fiancé and soon to be mother in law for lunch. We sat at the teppanyaki table. Ronnie was our server and she was amazing! Very friendly and always prompt service. Anthony was our chef and he was also great. He did some fun tricks I hadn't seen before and very personable to talk to. Daniel the manager was there and he was walking around checking in with the tables to make sure everything was going good. 

We started with the teriyaki wings that were juicy, hot, and had a lot of meat. Then we all had the chicken and filet Teppan-Yaki. It was incredible. The fried rice is so tasty and the filet is so tender. 

Overall everything was great. Service and food was excellent. I appreciated the managers response to a complaint and had a complete turn around experience this time. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Best ever !! If you can get Jeremiah as your chief he's amazing food is always good great drinks love this place"}
{"text":"I must say we had the most amazing chef ever. Not only did his tricks amuse us but we had great conversations with amazing food. This was our first time here and can't wait to go back to try something different."}
{"text":"If you like your food mushy and flavorless, then this is the place for you. I would advise to not waste your money at this location. I usually go to the happy valley location but my husband and I moved to the arrowhead area. We decided to try this location, and man it was terrible. I will be going back to the happy valley location. We order the steak and calamari plate (shared) and paid the 8 dollar up charge to get our own fried rice and veggies. We had asked our waitress if we could get new rice because the fried rice was in fact not fried rice. The new rice came out and that was not cooked enough! It still had hard rice. The food experience wasn't worth the price. The sushi rolls were falling apart and was just mush. Also our waitress was a little oblivious. The hostess sat us down at one of the high tables which was a bit small. (That was fine). However our waitress would try stacking plates onto our table, instead of just taking the plates that we were done with. She  didn't come around much either. We sat waiting for the check for about 10 minutes until she returned. This location was not busy at all. Should have known for seeing the turnout in this place."}
{"text":"Some days are better than others, but I do say this earns a solid four stars. I guess it depends on who's serving you. I've had some really good servers and then some not-so-hot ones. But the food is awesome so that really helps."}
{"text":"I went there in a party of 4 to celebrate a birthday.  There are several now in the valley and I was to find out they are locally franchised rather than a chain. The atmosphere seemed a bit antiseptic and bright for a Teppan style restaurant but I got over it. Whoever issued the building permit with that few parking spaces should be shot, the restaurant was only half full and I counted 2 open spaces in the lot before I took mine. Part of the parking is taken over by valet services. That seems to be a big thing here in Arizona because of the summer heat. We had a reservation for 6PM on a Friday which is the latest they will accept reservations. They used to have an hour or more wait on Friday and Saturday nights and advised Manuel to take advantage of the reservation. Not a good move on their part, we would have had 3 more people in our party if we could have made a reservation later or had been told they never fill the place up nowadays because of the economy. The Sushi bar and regular service side of the restaurant was busier but still not full. We left just before 8 and noticed they were seating 1/2 full tables at the grills and most of the grills were going unused.

The dinner itself was excellent, I had a filet and a Kirin along with the normal soup,salad,rice and veggies. Even though stated on the menu we were not offered white rice as an option but the fried rice was made right there on the grill and was good. Priced appropriately (the bill was about $4 less than at Mizumo's for an identical meal in July). The couple to my left were not very hungry and chose to split a meal, at $8 it wasn't bad because it gave each a full serving of soup, salad, rice, veggies and only the entree was split.  At a table of 9 only a gentleman about my age and I were using chopsticks for most of the meal (I never picked up my fork!). The show was a bit on the weak side but the cook (Korean, raised in D.C.) was more open and friendly than many of the Teppan chefs I have been served by. His favorite take out is Mexican 24hr taco shop. :-). The chef made a flaming birthday cake out of an onion and the restaurant brought the birthday woman a medley of ice cream. The wait staff was attentive without getting in the way. 

I would have given a 4 if it had better parking.  The location on Bell is actually closer to where I live and has more parking so I may try to talk someone into trying that one with me."}
{"text":"My best friend, her husband, my mom and I went here for the first time tonight for my mom's birthday. It did take a while to get a seat. It did take a while to get our food. BUT the food was good and the waiter we had was AMAZING. Unfortunately i didn't get his name. Him and the manager (I think) were very polite and friendly. They made sure we knew why it was taking so long. They made sure we had our food and refills on our drinks. They were professional but still super fun. We were laughing most of the night. We will definitely be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for our anniversary in December 2017 and really enjoyed the sushi. We had shrimp lovers, Katana and the sunset roll. I have pictures of those, since then we've been back twice. Each time was better than the last. A couple of weeks ago we sat at the bar and it was after 9, happy hour! I had the sweet and spicy crunch roll, and the spicy tuna rolls. My fav is the sweet and spicy crunch roll! We will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"4 of us went on a Friday night for Teppanyaki.  We got there at 6:25pm, the wait was 1 hour.  DUDE, I am starving...  OK, fine.  We were waiting by the front door, but people kept smoking right in front.  So, we walked outside for the car show to kill time.  It was almost 1 hour, we were finally seated.  I was a good 5 mins before a server knowledged our table of 9 teppanyakiers (4 of us, and another 2 and 3).  

She took our drink orders and it did take her a bit to come back.  Then she was finally here to take our appetizers, sushi, and dinner orders.  We all placed our orders.  The Vegas roll came up first.  You know what, that was my first time eating a roll.  It was very very good.  Instead of seaweed, it was with soy paper.  YUM!  My gyozas came next.  They were frozen and deep fried, so average...OK.  My husband's sushi took forever to come.  We had to ask the server about if the order was put in or not?  She checked and said they are plating the order.  He got his sushi and he said it was very good.  

The teppanyaki chef was entertaining.  The chicken and steak dinner with fried rice was ok, I had better teppanyaki food.

The service was below average, we had to keep asking for refills.  I am not sure if it was the server or the area that she had to cover.  Just slow service.  This should be 2-1/2 stars but the chef was fun so rounds up to a 3."}
{"text":"Not really a sushi place. More like a sports bar. They are the kings of spicy imitation crab. It's everywhere, on everything. Even just laying around the plate for \"presentation\". This is our last visit."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite place. I'm not a sushi fan so I stick with the California roll. Their filet mignon is incredible. Their teriyaki chicken is incredible. The fried rice and veggies are incredible. Service is always amazing."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time last night. It was disconcerting. The prices are astronomical. First time I have paid $100 for a dinner and drank soda out of a plastic \"Coca Cola\" cup.  No brown rice? Really.... I picked the frozen green beans and peas out of my fried rice and ate that and left the unhealthy white rice. I actually had to order an appetizer after my meal because I was still hungry. I gave it 3 stars because the salmon, halibut, and tuna were excellent. Absolutely did not love the iceberg lettuce salad out of a bag from the grocery store."}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was horrible. Actually It was busy out waiter, the waitresses would walk by smile and make eye contact. Out waiter never did & screwed up my husband's order he is allergic to zucchini and we specifically asked for NO zucchini and his meal was full of it. When we finally where able to find our waiter we nicely told him about the zucchini and he looked like he didn't know what we were talking about
  Needless to say we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Hostess was very stressed and said only had two people to serve and said we had to wait 15min for service while in bar area. However the bartender Amary was awesome helped us right away. The best time for sushi is happy hour. Their service could use some more help, still love this place holding out hope."}
{"text":"Great service food was great...waiter named David gave ice cream to my daughter that was nice of hem"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Teppanyaki place, never has sushi at this location.  Expect to pay $25 for a typical entree.  We usually skip drinks to save $$$.

The atmosphere is nice, good separation between the bar/sushi area and the cooking tables.  I never expect anything but average service from a Japanese Restaurant and this is no exception.  

Most recently I had Scallops/Shrimp combo and it was delightful.  Scallops prepared excellent, not rubbery, can't say the same thing about the shrimp.  Daughter had chicken which always tastes a bit funny to me and son had NY Steak and wife opted for the Filet.  As a family we all love their fried rice as part of the entree' it's what keeps us coming back.  Miso soup was average and the salad was quite good.

As they say, we all left fat dumb and happy with some leftovers for lunch the next day.

Family of four with tip, $115."}
{"text":"Based on my experience this is a \"two-star\" restaurant but given the experience of two co-workers and a friend \"one-star\".

I've had their spicy tuna rolls, a Bento Box, and celebrated an anniversary at the Teppanyaki table.   I've been there during lunch only and the place is generally empty at 11:30, except on Fridays.

The ambiance is nice, nothing special.  I wish the Teppanyaki tables were secluded.  I've never experienced \"poor\" service here in my 5 -  6 visits during the past 4 years but I go for the food and conversation not to make friends with the wait staff.

Service ***
Food **
Teppanyaki *** (a little salty but isn't it always?)
Experience **
Price**

I've heard three reports of the \"dreaded food poisoning\" by co-workers and my wife's friend who visited this spring but have never had any issues with myself or my party.  

Probably won't be headed back anytime soon, nobody wants to go with me.  

Like others have mentioned, stick with the Arrowhead location."}
{"text":"Best sushi place in town. Service is always good, and they have a nice happy hour later in the evening. Went this past week again and loved it as usual. It's nice that their menu explains in detail what's all in their rolls, and they have a nice big variety of them. I got my favorite thing there again, the tootsie roll. It was great as usual!"}
{"text":"We can't understand why this place gets bad reviews.  The service is good and the food excellent!

We've been three times.  The next time we go to Phoenix we're stopping in."}
{"text":"Food is great. Great atmosphere and service, without the pretentiousness of Benihana, or the chairs designed to fatigue. 
The Steak and Shrimp are always a safe bet dinner.  Steak and Scallops are quite good."}
{"text":"The hostess is terrible.  She said she can seat us within 30 mins.  90 min. later she still hasn't done so.  But 3 groups came in a were seated right away.  We had a party of 8.  I understand the others may have had a reservation but when a table of 8 opens after we waited for over an hour, why would you not seat us!.  We asked for the manager.  She was less than helpful.  She wouldn't even listen to what we had to say.  This is a very poorly run restaurant.  Later when I asked for something for a burn I received from one of the chefs throwing around grease while cleaning the grill, they couldn't find the ointment.  Finally the bartender who witnessed the whole mess all night went into the kitchen to find it.  The manager never came out to see what had happened or to apologize.  She is so not management material.  I can't understand how she got the job.  Needless to say we will never go to that restaurant again!"}
{"text":"I have been to 4 of the Ah-so restaurants in town and I have never seen one with all the NFL helmets on display. Just seems wierd to have the helmets on display at an Asian sushi restaurant, it doesnt fit, anyway I always sit at the teppin table and get steak and shrimp and I should have stuck to that routine. This time I was in the mood for sushi and so I ordered the shrimp tampura roll and a spicy tuna roll. The shrimp roll was ok not my favorite. The spicy tuna roll was no good at all. The tuna was bad and should have never been served.. This has to be the worst roll I have ever had. I wanted a roll with crab and they do not have real crab at all. I dont mind paying extrea for it but to not have it at all is BS. My friend had the Egg Noddle with shrimp bowl. The bowl they serve it in is rediculous. It is huge and just annoying to eat out of. My friend took just a few bites and sent it back.  It took about 15 min from the time I ate the tuna roll and payed the bill and got into my car. By this time my stomache was a mess and needless to say it ruined my Friday night. I spent most of it in the restroom every 15 min for a few hours. This place is no good and I will not be back."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for my pregnant best friend's 25th birthday today for a table of 14. (Keep in mind, she's already emotional to begin with). We get here at 7PM sharp and wait to be seated... The host then checks his reservation book and says we don't have a reservation set up. I ask him to look again because I made the reservation myself this morning and got a confirmation from the employee. After arguing back and forth for about 3 minutes, He checks again and then sees the reservation however it isn't made until tomorrow... We then ask when the next table will be ready and we are told it's gonna take one hour to get the table ready...  Oh yeah, and it's MONDAY! So I ask to speak to a manager because why should we wait one hour! Isn't that the whole point of a reservation! We shouldn't be punished for somebody else's incompetent mistake !"}
{"text":"This was my 1st time going to this location for food.  I've been to another location but it was only for a few cocktails.  The service wasn't horrible but the food was \"ok\" and it was definitely over priced.  I was surprised to see how busy it was for a Monday evening.  The place looked pretty clean and I did like the décor.  They seemed to be over staffed as there were a lot of employees just standing around near the sushi bar.  Most likely I won't go again unless a friend invites me.  The Phoenix area is swamped with restaurants so I'm sure I can find a better one for the price."}
{"text":"i go to ahso regularly.
I went there last night with couple of my friends, just to grab some sushi and teppanyaki food.
theyr sushi used to be A LOT better, but i still go mainly because i think they have the most fresh seafood in terms of sushi grade(I love sushi and ive been in many places to try)
i normally sit at a dinning table mainly because it is A LOT faster.

NOW.
I dont know if ill ever go back to this restaurant again because of what i saw last night.

this some short asian dude always comes on weekends and roams around the store. (im assuming he is the owner, cuz I see him buying drinks for ppl and stuff)

I know hes not the manager, because ive seen their managers before and they are both nice. (The female one is pretty HOT! lol)

Getting to the point,

that little asian dude..WAS ACTUALLY FORCING HIS EMPLOYEES (A HOSTESS AND  A SERVER) TO *DRINK* with the group of people that he was with.

(I overheard what they were saying, so i clearly knew they were drinking not by their own will)

HOW UNPROFESSIONAL.

it made me wonder if this happened regularly and that i am being served by possibly a drunk person.

Their food is great, I love their giant screen TVs, but im not too sure if ill ever go back because of what i saw."}
{"text":"We dine here a few times a month and each time sort of wish we didn't; don't get me wrong the service is great and the tepanuyaki is cool, but we go for the sushi happy hour because it is SO CHEAP but it has progressively become worse and worse quality. The rolls have come out wrong, with more crab mix and less fresh fish and they are usually falling apart. Sad to see it going down hill like this."}
{"text":"I gave a very good review for this restaurant but todayyty when I visited this place the general manager behaved very badly with me. Everytime I order 1 teriyaki chicken and they give soup and salad with it. I never mention I need 1 or 2. Today the manager Mr. Jen came and said you will get one soup and one salad and not two. I said how can you say this when I never asked for two. He constantly kept on saying that we always complain about soup and salad and he said us that we should never visit this restaurant. 

Leave alone his saying we ourselves will never visit here after this insult."}
{"text":"Nine of us came at 5:30 with a reservation and were promptly seated. Our drink and appetizer order was taken within five minutes. We ordered from the teppanyaki menu and everything was amazing, from the show (setting the plates on fire was the highlight) to deliciously cooked food. The steak came out perfectly and the kids meals seemed to be just as large as the adult portions.

Our waitress was very quick and responsive. We enjoyed good service all around and look forward to coming back again soon."}
{"text":"If you have a Restaurant.com gift certificate, be warned that the ownership has decided they won't honor them anymore, even though they have no expiration date. (Have fun trying to get it exchanged).

And don't bother asking to speak to a manager about it, the hostess will ignore you with a deer-in-headlights stare.

I won't be returning here."}
{"text":"Very mediocre and the prices aren't cheap, Las Vegas roll had no flavor and was the priciest roll I ordered. Wouldn't go back I can find better sushi at a better price"}
{"text":"The staff was less than attentive ... Left a hostess station waiting.  Food covered in eel sauce not sure what they were covering up and staff very unfriendly!!! Not coming back!!"}
{"text":"I've never had a problem at Ah-So's. I love coming for their sushi and they have great happy hour options. On this visit I came at night for dinner craving sushi. I haven't visited this location in a while but decided to on this night for the convenience. It wasn't busy for a Monday night and the atmosphere was calming. Our server was really nice and checked on us periodically

I decided on the shrimp lover roll which was exceptional and also went with a chicken and steak hibachi plate. My friend and I shared and it was the perfect amount for 2. There was an option to split the amount of food in two different plates for $7 extra but we just choose the 1 plate option with a spare plate on the side to split it ourself. Everything was delicious. Always a good time"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some dinner and drinks and had a great experience. Our server was Gigi and she was simply amazing. Food was good too! The sushi, miso soup and salad were all very tasty. Sashimi platter was a good variety of the fish we would have ordered and was very fresh. Again, Gigi was extremely attentive and has the friendliest demeanor. She's a great server! Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for honestly probably close to 8-9 years now. They serve amazing sushi and their happy hour deal is the bomb. Sake bombs are my recommendation for anyone. Also the new manager Jerry is extremely nice and helps with anything. The dude let us stay late and finish all our drinks and had a good ass conversation"}
{"text":"I've been to Ah-So a few times now and it's always been a pleasant experience. Nothing out of the ordinary amazing but it's good. They have some great specials for lunch which I've taken advantage of twice now. 

I've had sushi there twice now and until this last time, I wasn't overly impressed.  I tried the lobster tempura roll and it was actually very delicious. It had a great crisp on the outside and the flavor sauce they used was amazing.  I also had the egg roll appetizers which were also very good.

I would recommend a bit updating in the waiting area as the couches are quite a bit run down and a bit gross. Not something you really want to sit on."}
{"text":"this place is a little weird, i gotta say. i've been to the others and very much enjoyed my meals/cocktails. this location is just ok. we've now been 3 times. sushi prices are pretty high, but the sushi was good on all 3 occasions so i'll tolerate the prices. there's no happy hour, which is a disappointment but there are drink specials during certain televised sports games - the specials end once the game ends.  

the design of the restaurant is awkward, with 2 booths back to back across from the bar and completely separate from the rest of the restaurant. the ceiling is high and the restaurant gets very, very loud on a saturday night. the saturday night we visited we stopped at the bar for a drink while we waited for our table and the bartender greeted our party of 4 with \"i need your IDs if you're going to sit here\". we of course provided them, but given that this is a service establishment a kinder and friendlier greeting (\"Hi, how are you?\") would have been appreciated, followed by a respectful request for our IDs.

there are a lot of tables, but there is definitely room for more. the restaurant would benefit from a professional designer. our teppan chef was less than entertaining and the teppan prices are a bit high for the area and the quality. i would say the teppan was average, as was the entire experience on all 3 days. one other note: the beers on display on the shelf behind the bar aren't necessarily available. some are \"decor\" and not available for purchase, a major disappointment. don't show it to me if i can't have it!

i'll return for the sushi, but i won't be dropping big bucks here."}
{"text":"Ambiance is nice- the sushi is superb, but the service could be better. Nice tunes from the dj and happy hour drink prices can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best sums this place up. And no happy hour on Fridays!? Ah so lousy. Screw you & your whole chain. And thanks for the chewy mussels that we spit into napkins like old gum. Blech."}
{"text":"Decent sushi (taking into consideration that this is AZ) but service and parking were horrible.

Waited 15 minutes to get any type of recognition from our waitress.  We ordered appetizers and various rolls and nigiri pieces.  The sushi came out before the appetizers.   When the appetizers did arrive they were a disappointment.  Well, I take half of that back, the edamame was good (hard to screw up) but the calamari was 1. weird it wasn't traditional calamari but long breaded and fried planks of calamari 2. gross.  It seriously tasted like it came out of a Gordon's frozen box.  Almost like a really bad, huge fishstick. 

Anyhow, like I said, the sushi was good.  We had the dragon roll, unagi, spicy tuna roll, yellow tail and an avocado roll.  Warning: The spicy tuna roll will kick your ass.  It was really spicy.  Really, really spicy.  

Non-food observations: No wait for sushi, but I guess there was like a 20-30 minute wait for the steak portion of this place.  The decor was fine.  Industrial-ish building/floors and an aquarium behind the sushi bar (I didn't get to see the area in back which I am guessing is the grill area the other review talked about).  Parking was HORRIBLE.  They've got this weird half circle parking lot that doesn't have any kind of escape back in the corners so if you go back there and there isn't a space you have to make a 12 point turn to get out.  Drove around in the parking lot for 10 minutes looking/waiting for a spot.  It doesn't really help that people in Arizona are notoriously bad at taking forever to pull out of their spots..."}
{"text":"Our family enjoys the quality and atmosphere of thus Ah So. Close and convenient and they handle special meal prep requests w grace"}
{"text":"Great happy hour!! Calamari is delicious and its a great atmosphere! Enjoy having a good time with friends there"}
{"text":"The manager was a complete moron and terrible customer service. The hostess was rude we wanted a seat at the fire pit and she said there was no room and that the regular tables are just as good and didn't ask if we wanted to wait. the hostess started arguing with another person there.  Food came out not what we ordered along with a salad that wasn't green but white. Manager fought with me be said there was nothing wrong with it.  this was about a month ago when I was there.  Never had an issue at the Gilbert location. definitely will NOT return to this location."}
{"text":"Actual Japanese sushi chefs!  Very friendly staff, nice location, we just did the sushi bar on this visit and were not disappointed!  Reasonable pricing, seemingly endless happy hour, and the sushi was really good!"}
{"text":"Best happy hour in town by far!!! Definitely sit in the Bar/Lounge area."}
{"text":"We got here often with our family for the teppen yake and we love it!  Great service, better quality food and more options.  Tried Benihana and was TOTALLLY disappointed.  We will continue to go here with our friends and family."}
{"text":"The quality of dinner was equivalent to Panda Grill, I will not go back...not worth the mondy"}
{"text":"I don't know why all the bad reviews. Never had a poor experience here. Great food, attentive servers and even better reverse happy hour pricing."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Received my sushi 1 hour after ordering and after all my friends had received their food AND finished eating it."}
{"text":"I think Ive told my self each time come im not  coming back but I figure quick happy hour spot since I'm in the area......ummmmmm nope the bartender with the piercing in his face was sub par at best and rude..I  wasn't acknowledged until another patron says \"you have another patron\" serves me my bear and 10 min later I had to ask for a menu...ordered 2 rolls they were Ok at best.....the last time I was here they charged my debit card twice and when I called in the morning the manager told me wells fargo does that for everyone I told her that's not true and won't be back.....last time here..no wonder beer is 1.69 for happy hour only way u can get people here....last time...I promise and once finished eating he took the dishes that he had given me and the one I didn't use but had touched put it back into the clean pile. ...that's how people get sick...u moron....ok I'm done"}
{"text":"Chef was hilarious, waiter was great, food was decent, and even when we kept adding to our order, the staff was very willing to make changes. I really enjoyed the atmosphere, and while the food was a little steep on some things, it was alright on others. My family goes here often, and I have to say it did make me a fan."}
{"text":"Great sushi and atmosphere..try the lollipop roll!!  Service was great!!  I will come back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Was at the sushi bar and I got food poisoning here. If your fish smells or tastes funny, don't eat eat. Some of the fish I ate didn't taste like it usually should. I thought maybe they added some type of sauce or something. Bottom line is there are much better sushi places around here that serve fresh sushi."}
{"text":"Yelp! asks : Are they good for kids?

Answer: No. Not if you're a single parent for the night. After having to take two little girls to go potty (leaving the table 'empty'), that meant to the busboys that we had dined and dashed (even considering that our plates were still pretty covered with food and some personal items at the table. So... not only did I pay a hefty price tag to eat less than half of my food without leftovers, but I was also not greatly comped. They're currently making rice and veggies for the road. Considering I paid for chicken and NY Steak. Yippie.

What I was able to eat before it was trashed was an overcooked medium steak and pretty good rice and veggies."}
{"text":"Ah-So is a great addition to the Goodyear area. 

I walked into an enjoyable environment, with helpful service and great food. My friends have enjoyed the happy hour specials, and their great sushi offerings almost every week for a month now. I have not tried much of the teppanyaki table offerings, but from the sushi menu,  I can say that I have fully enjoyed the experience. We will return regularly for good food and good times."}
{"text":"I honestly wouldn't give this place any star's if that was possible. It's been awhile since I've had absolutely horrible service and tasteless food all in one visit. But this location seemed to hit both.

The service was HORRIBLE. My friend and I decided to sit at the bar, thinking that getting drinks would be easier but the girl was for lack of better words just out of it and not paying attention and we had to wave her down every time we wanted to get something to drink.

As for the food. THE WORST sushi I've ever had. The rolls were seriously overpriced, and disgusting.Aside from the fact she just completely forgot two of our rolls. Our meals came with soup that our waitress/bartender forgot about and she but after we reminded her she brought them out and it was basically just broth no tofu. Totally cheap'd out on the Miso Soup. 

I left that place soo upset and just soo disappointed. I would STRONGLY suggest you not waste your time nor your money on making a visit here. I have plenty of positive sushi reviews and suggestions if you're looking for a great spot."}
{"text":"Good service, good atmosphere, good sushi.  Like that you get miso soup with your sushi order!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my cousin today and this place was not so bad. 

The location, though ideal for a restaurant, but the outside patio faces a main intersection within the shopping plaza, making it so noise. Can't really deduct points for that as the noise is out of their control, bit thought I'd let readers know as we sat outside, it was hard to have a conversation with cars passing by. 

Our seating hostess and server were both friendly and super nice. The server made sure to check up on us often, but not so often that felt interrupting. She made sure we enjoyed our meal and asked if we needed anything else. 

It was happy hour and their prices on the happy hour were very reasonable. $3 on domestic beer and 4 on imports. I ordered me a kilt lifter which hit the spot, then ordered me a Vegas roll  $5 happy hour price. It was okay, not necessarily the best vegas roll I have had.

My lunch was from their Bento Box section of the menu, and I had the steak bento box. It wasn't bad, but the steak was really cold and it didn't fee as if it has just come out of the grill. 

I'd come here again and try something else. My return would basically be because the wait staff was so nice."}
{"text":"Sushi is okay, you are paying for quality not quantity. We sat at a booth table next time will try to sit at the teppanyanki."}
{"text":"I love their chicken fried rice, steak & chicken dish and my husband loves their sushi & shashimi dishes. Cocktails aren't the greatest, but the saki bombs aren't bad (can't really mess those up)."}
{"text":"Nice atmoshphere. I expected to find a sushi bar and grill however I didn't realze it was a full Japanese steak house with hibachi, etc. The food was okay and the atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Service was great!!! Ask for Aubrey!"}
{"text":"I sat at sushi bar and told the sushi chef Johnny to surprise me. I was indeed surprised and impressed. I got saviche roll and it was very good. I advise you not to use any soy sauce or you will not enjoy the true flavor of the roll. It's a must if you're in a mood for something refreshing."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant before. The management and service was terrible. We didn't even get a chance to eat so don't apply this review to their food. 

Save your time and find a restaurant with management that cares about customers and their business."}
{"text":"The wife and I went here for a New Years dinner for two... it's pretty much the only fine dining place in Goodyear outside of the Wigwam (and they only had NYE dinners that night). I feel bad that the company around us got more of our attention then the chef at the table but it defiantly was an enjoyable experience. The price point is average for Teppanyaki dinner and the service here is top notch. I had no issues on my order or anything simple like refills or cleanliness. The sushi was well crafted and the steak and chicken combo with fried rice was quite tasty. Probably the best fried rice I have had in the valley of the sun. My wife enjoyed her Mai Tai's and dish as well. This is a nice place to have a unique date night and I would suggest that yelper's give it a try."}
{"text":"If you're looking to have a wildly overpriced lukewarm Japanese lunch, this place is for you. The disgust for the price is only matched by the lackluster service! Ugh."}
{"text":"Have been here several time and have always had great experiences.  Have been here for Father's Day and most recently for a graduation celebration.  We sat at a teppanyaki table both times.  We all love this experience, especially the kids.  The food is amazing and well worth the price. The staff has always been amazing, very personable, friendly and attentive.  We definitely recommend Ah-So goodyear!"}
{"text":"Called for a reservation and was told they were overbooked but decided to walk in anyway with a party of four. Found they only had two of there tables seated and one chef working. Stood at the front desk for ten minutes before the hostess even approaches the stand to greet us. Asked to be seated and was told they didn't have room even though the restaurant was basically empty. Asked for the manager and took him another 5 min to show up said he would see what the problem was but we were done by that point had been there for 20 min and with a empty restaurant they were not able to help us. I guess the business is so good that they don't need ours! 
Side remark this was a Saturday evening at 5:30pm. For the manager your problem is you are not staffed to support your business and will continue to lose business with this poor service. Really on Saturday evening you don't have staffing for a restaurant???? 
Horrible"}
{"text":"Came here with my daughter while she came home from college. The food was great, the cook was excellent.  Unfortunately the service here was lacking; we decide to do the teppanyaki , we were seated a good 25 minutes before our server arrived to take drink orders. He was late pretty much the rest of the evening,  we had to constantly request drink refills. The restaurant was not that busy being a Sunday evening. I'm still up in the air whether to cone back and try again."}
{"text":"we had Sandra as our server she was awesome , really friendly. Ordered the Vegas roll and yakisoba, disappointed that the noodles were ramen noodles and the veggies were too soft. Other than that it was great, yummy sushi. definitely come back for happy hour"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, the food is great! The greeting waitresses, however, have no manners and are borderline rude. I came to this location because I moved and it is closer than the other however I will probably go back to the other location now. My drive is about 30 minutes. The couple times I've gone and had take out my order has always been right. And of course not only was the greeting staff rude but after I verified with them my order was correct, I get home only to find they charged me for one thing and I received another. It may be sometime before I go here again. I initially wasn't going to write a post after speaking with the manager about the greeters, however, I'm extremely disappointed and I am not happy about being misinformed and treated rudely. I hope they work on customer service!! They will lose a lot of customers if they don't!"}
{"text":"Yay my first 1 star review!! I didn't die after dining here so maybe that's a bit harsh but that's just how I feel. This place just plain sucks. Granted I didn't try much on the menu, no meat, no seafood but judging from the other reviews it probably would not have mattered.

I probably never would have come here but I got forced into going with a work group for the obligatory birthday celebrations. I usually try to avoid these because the short list of where we end up usually includes Olive Garden and TGIF. Meh.

I had the asparagus rolls and sweet tofu sushi(Inari). I had to load the tiny little asparagus rolls with ginger, wasabi and soy sauce to give them any sustenance. The sweet tofu was missing some normal ingredients I was expecting, the tofu pouch was mushy and cold. I snuck some vegetable tempura off a plate of a coworker and even that was not anything great - how do you f up Vegetable Tempura?!

The biggest issue was when I got there I asked for water. When the waitress came back asking if I was having anything to drink I said just water. When the meal was over and I asked if I could get a water she came back 5 min later with nothing but the checks for everyone. Awesome. 

The Teppanyaki guys were pretty good, I will give them that. I don't know how everyones else meal was and frankly I don't care. I lost 45 minutes of my life and $11.25 I will never get back. Saynara Ah-So."}
{"text":"Been a couple of times. Not as fancy as other teppan places, but food and service were good and prices are a tad lower so its a great place"}
{"text":"Writing this Soley on the sushi. Not impressed. Tastes gross. Got the 7pc sashimi 7pc sushi with a tuna hand roll. I'm eating it now and it's bad. The sushi is bad the rice tastes over cooked and like at the end of the pot, dry. I finished the sushi, but it felt hard. The bartender was very sweet nice guy. I'm sure the employees are great but quality of food would not come back. Sad because they seemed to invest all the money on tvs and the outside looks really nice."}
{"text":"Service and food are not consistent. 
We came here 3 times to this location and was expecting the same quality service and food, but today was a major disappointment from an employee hispanic sushi chef.
Small, very small sized nigiri sushi and the way he responds to my question is not friendly. Just totally ruined my appetite and I stopped eating.
I will not recommend this place and will not return to this place ever again."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst experience ever. We ordered three entrees of the three the sushi roll was the only good thing. 
The bento boxes were lacking appeal and taste we decided to bring it to attention of manager he didn't care he said yeah you must have high expectations of grilled teriyaki chicken then but ours is the best. You could tell that it was frozen! 

Then the sushi cook kept taking his glasses off and on and we mentioned it to Tony the manager he said \"well what do you expect he's 65 years old of course he needs glasses\"

Ultimately after that remark we said we were not happy and he said well then leave if your not happy with what I'm saying. Never have had a manager lack experience and courtesy. Totally appalled! Horrible customer service"}
{"text":"As much as I'd like and tried...still ain't no good!  Being their competitor PF Chang's is next door you'd think these guys could step it up?  Service is fine but food bland and fish refrigerated tasting and looking."}
{"text":"I come here all the time ! Best sushi around 
Sometimes the service is slow but it's worth the wait"}
{"text":"I was in the area last Friday the 13th and was planning on getting a tattoo in the same mall as AhSo. There was a wait time and I witnessed many people go over to AhSo to eat and drink while waiting to get their work done. The area was jam packed. Apparently Joe at AhSo took it upon himself to alienate and offend all patrons in the area. He had tow trucks towing cars that were parked in the parking lot (including restaurant customers) and caused such a scene that the tattoo parlor had to close early and apologize to all the people that wouldn't be able to be seen.  That's right, a restaurant manager acted so unprofessional and the tattoo owner took the high road. In the past I have attended work lunches, birthdays, etc. at AhSo. Needless to say,  Joe has left such an impression that I will not go there again. Iconic Tattoo on the other hand, earned lots of respect from me in the way they handled the situation and I will definitely be visiting there again (that's if Joe doesn't tow my car)."}
{"text":"The food is okay, nothing special, but the service blows! I've been here a few times over the past few years with my family and every visit the service steadily declines. The waitstaff is rude and/or clueless as to what they are doing. Maybe I'll try again during my next visit to AZ and hopefully by then they'll have some better employees."}
{"text":"Great friendly service at the bar. The place has been totally redecorated, no football helmets any more. Food was top notch and fresh. Good spot. Give another try!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has such awful reviews. I've been eating here since it opened and have always had a great experience. Food is amazing. I usually order off the teppen menu. They cook things to order and everything is always very fresh. I don't usually order sushi because I feel like
I need to save room for the delicious entree. Shrimp sauce is exceptional. I also like the calamari appetizer. 

I feel like service has always been fairly consistent. Every once in awhile I'll get a server that isn't very attentive but nothing that would keep me from coming back.

I have two complaints but they're not on the quality or flavor of the food. It seems portions have decreased even though prices have increased. Also, when I order to go, they don't include soup or salad unless you specifically tell them you want it. They also don't tell you they don't include it. Those are the reasons I'm giving Ah So 4 stars instead of 5. 

It's definitely my favorite restaurant in the area by far."}
{"text":"The best sushi around. The Las Vegas rolls are the most amazing. Super fresh and delicious. Happy Hour everyday and $5 rolls! Stick to sushi though. Believe it or not, I've had undercooked rice several times with my entree. Seems that they might know how to cook rice since it's a staple there. The tepanyaki is good, but I've had better and have been better entertained at the place down the road on Litchfield. :)"}
{"text":"The sushi is okay, but their steak is so good. I love their fried rice. Weird decor... They should really work on that!"}
{"text":"My family and I always have a good experience when we go here, and we go about once a week. It's a little pricey, but that's no secret with this place.


UPDATE: This place sucks now. They changed their menus recently, the people that bring the crappy salads and soup totally disappear when the teppanyaki starts so you never get drink refills or anything else you might need, and they cook the food differently now so the rice taste bland and everything else is very greasy. Very disappointed since this use to be our Friday night hangout. Now we go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice, and the experiences I've had here have been so diametrically opposed, I'm not even sure it was the same restaurant. The first time, everything was perfect. Parking was a breeze, the food was extraordinary, the chef charming, and a good time was had by all.

Tonight, however, was a different story. As we drove up, parking lot attendants were putting cones all over the place, including in a spot we were about to drive into. So we either had to acquiesce to the forced valet service, or find a spot in another parking lot. We chose the latter. Ah So is not cheap, and they add an 18% gratituity onto the bill, so we were NOT going to pay for valet parking.

Once we were seated, before the cooking 'show' began, I ordered a plate of tamago (sushi) because I was starving. In a word, it was bland. Absolutely tasteless. And later, the efforts of the cook proved to be unfortunately similar. The food he grilled was equally bland, needing soy sauce AND salt to give it some flavor. Our waiter was pleasant enough but scarce to be found, as he never refilled our drinks. Methinks Ah-So should change its name to So-So.

As for the show, the cook was fairly charming, making the famous flaming onion cake, and tossing bits of fried egg into people's mouths. As he dished up food off the grill onto our plates, he would say little things like, \"For the birthday girl!\" \"Bottoms up!\" etc. However, when he got to me, he looked at my rotund frame, dumped a load of fried rice onto my plate and said, \"Oink, oink!\" 

Oh. My. God.

How rude. You just blew your tip. 

Honestly, I was so stunned I couldn't speak. I guess he thought he was being funny, and that I would like being reminded that I'm large.

Wrong on both counts."}
{"text":"This place was great.  friendly staff. Fast. Amazing food.  GREAT tappenyaki show very animated and funny. I ordered the calamari and streak combination and the Las Vegas roll. Everything was just so delicious. Really nice inside also."}
{"text":"I love love teppanyaki. I took my dad and my boyfriend for Father's Day lunch! The food was good however it was lacking some flavor just a bit! I honestly think the cook was in a hurry to leave! I'm just glad my dad really liked it considering he's never been there!"}
{"text":"Would have been 4 or 5 stars if the waiter had come back at some point during the meal to see if we needed anything.  One beer is not enough during the meal - and the place was not that busy or understaffed."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with this place. I eat a lot of sushi and was not impressed. Part of the fun is the plating but itwas nothing to get excited about just rolls tossed onto a plate. The rolls were basic and not rolled tight. We had to ask for wasabi and ginger and the atmosphere was so loud due to the grill that we had to shout to talk.The only good thing was our server was so sweet but  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about this place but went to dinner here for my birthday on a Friday night and was totally disappointed. There was no wait time by the hostess was super snobby. Rolling her eyes and yelling \"what?!\" with an attitude when she couldn't hear me the first time I gave her the number of guests because she was distracted. The food was blah. Ordered 3 sushi rolls, nothing amazing. My husband had a chicken plate and stopped eating halfway through cause he just didn't want anymore. Basically every server and cook walking by would slide their arm on our booth when turning the corner. It was weird, we could here the sliding every time and they'd almost touch our backs. The only great thing about this place was our waitress (Ana Lisa I think?). She was so sweet and smiley. Just a great personality. But we won't be back."}
{"text":"Devon is the tits! Best service ever!!! Definitely coming back! Oh yeah ps johns awesome!"}
{"text":"I went there tonight for my birthday dinner. My Friends wanted sushi and I wanted a steak.  I ordered a fillet mignon medium rare. I got a chopped up fried medium well steak. Over cooked and tasted fried. This restaurant has no business advertising themselves as a steakhouse.  The desert they provided was absolutely outstanding.  My friends really enjoyed their sushi."}
{"text":"Our experience at this restaurant last night was unacceptable. The food was great but the service was horrible. First the hostess sat me and my wife alone for like 20 minutes while we waited for other guests. We were ok with that, we know they won't do the \"show\" for just 2 people. They brought 3 more people to sit with us. Well these people were waiting for 4 others to join them. After another 20 min. We heard the lady call her friends who had not even left the house. The hostess should have coordinated this better. When we asked to be moved to the regular part of the restaurant we were promptly moved. The waiter then took our order. Then 15 min later came back and took our order again because he had forgotten that he had taken our order. After all that the waiter brings us the wrong check. My wife and I were celebrating our 26th wedding anniversary and this place is usually part of our tradition. We will be looking for another place next year."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday for lunch with a group of four and were seated immediately at the teppanyaki table. The presentation was great and fun. The food was good to excellent and enough to satisfy. We had steak, chicken and shrimp and they were all good. I see most reviewers complaining about wait times or service, we did not experience that on our visit."}
{"text":"Always a great experience. To be honest though we can't typically afford going anytime except happy hour. I wish the menu was just a little bit more affordable. But I do love the saki bombs and the sushi! This place is almost always packed but that's a sign they are doing something right."}
{"text":"Do not eat here! The food is beyond bad in fact after talking to just one other person about how bad the food was they told me they have gotten very sick from eating there.  The texture of the fish was not right.  The smell as soon as you walk in should tell you how bad it is.   I left feeling disgusted and shouldn't have eaten anything.   Do your self a favor and go any place but here, it's just terrible.  Not to mention the Mexican sushi maker starred at my roommate the whole time making her uncomfortable.  Very bad class not clean and tastes horrible.  This place doesn't deserve a star it should be shut down and the health inspector called immediately."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on a slow Thursday night on my own. I wasn't greeted right away, and all of the kids running the place showed no sign that they knew I was there. 

Eventually a server came up and took my order in an unfriendly way. Meaning he talked really fast, and as he asked me what I was having, he looked away from me and out the window. It was nice outside, so I guess that's where he wanted to be. Makes sense. 

The cool part was the flames from the two Teppanyaki tables across the restaurant, and the \"oohs and ahhhs.\"

The sashimi appetizer had 5-7 pieces of fresh fish which weren't fishy or anything. My meal was their steak with veggies and fried rice. It was cooked right, and was flavorful. 

Not to be age-ist, but when the service isn't the best, and no one looks the part of actually being in charge, it's not the greatest. 

My server did a lot of standing around talking. Also the hostess and him must have a little somethin'-somethin' going on! Every time she'd come up to him, she'd get very close to him, and he'd slide his hand onto her waist and pull her hips toward him, and rub her lower back. Good times at work."}
{"text":"Ah-So was just sort of so-so.  Sushi, could have been better.  Service really needs help.  It shouldn't take so much time to get our bill so we could escape.  I might give it another chance down the road, but we spent a lot of money for lunch and just walked away kinda annoyed.   I was a little turned off by the decor but could overlook this if the food really wowed me."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! Insulted by the manager.    We had just put our spoons down from sharing my birthday dessert we had not received our check and the manager came to our table to ask us to move so that they could seat the next group.   We told him we had not received our check he did apologize,  but it wasn't sincere.  He continued to offer to move us to another table since he had to rotate the table as he apologized,  I told him to not bother.   Until that  moment he asked to move we were having a great evening celebrating my birthday.   Food was great but the short bald manager ruined my birthday dinner.   Will not be back!"}
{"text":"Ah so happy valley does not deserve such a low rating! Consistently better sushi than many other higher rated north valley locations. Food is not the problem - occasionally service might be (according not to reviews) but I've always had great service. Shout out to our great server tonight, tanner. This has been a favorite for years and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight for a quick snack. The place was jammed and it wasn't Happy Hour. At any rate we were seated at the sushi bar and had 2 rolls and left. I ordered the Vegas and Rainbow Rolls, my 2 favorites. I will be back. This restaurant is consistent, clean and most importantly we have never been served any sketchy sushi. The staff were very attentive as always. Not sure why anyone gives this place less than 3 stars. I come here frequently. I eat sushi at other restaurants on a regular basis as well so I am able to compare and I know the standard. This is definitely a safe bet and then some."}
{"text":"Food was not fresh, even the sushi. Shrimp, mussels, scallops and calamari were chewy."}
{"text":"I always loved the Ah-So's in Gilbert.  But, I live in Phoenix now and had the WORST experience ever!  First when we came into the establishment we were greeted and I then told the girl that we wanted to sit where the chef was, and she said there was no room there and that the food is just as good as if you sat at a normal table.  I thought that was kind of rude when my guest has never been there and I wanted my guest to experience it. When the salad came out the salad was welted and white nothing fresh. The general manager even argued with me saying that the lettuce in the salad that was white is supposed to be white?  Isn't salad supposed to have green lettuce?  Yes, I think so! Also, when our food came out we asked for our steak to be medium rare and came out almost well done when I brought all of the issues to his attention he said what do you want me to do about it?  I think the management isn't so great at this location, but the waitress that helped us was awesome.  So as for this location I will never return, but I will definitely go back to the Gilbert location if I am ever in that area."}
{"text":"I have been enjoying Japanese food since I lived in Okinawa close to twenty years.  I have literally had teppanyaki all over the world. I went to Ah-So for the first time this past Sunday. The service was excellent. The chef was chatty, but not too chatty. The food was excellent for American Japanese. The miso soup was excellent. I had the shrimp and scallops which was superb with the ginger sauce. My picky eight year old had the chicken teriyaki which he devoured. My husband had the steak, chicken and shrimp which was also very good. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here with my husband for his birthday tonight , sat down at a teppanyaki table. Had drinks,soup and salad in a timely fashion. But waited nearly an hour still no chef at the table, we got up to leave. Told the server and paid. This is our second bad experience here where the customer service was lacking."}
{"text":"Love the teppan style food. The shrimp and steak is my favorite, along with the fried rice. The staff are super friendly and always helpful. The only downside is when I come for lunch, it's always a 20-30 minute wait from the point I sit down until the chef comes to the table."}
{"text":"Was pretty excited to come here because I haven't been in so long. From the start we received horrible service and it took the manager to bring us waters. By the time the waiter came (he was super nice) we were already ready to order and out of water. Service was slow and the food was ok. It didn't taste fresh but it wasn't dry. I'll come back, I just think they were slammed and couldn't make it work."}
{"text":"We've come here many times. Great sushi when they can get your order right. In the last 5 visits I have sent 3 orders back for being wrong so your odds of getting what you asked for right the first time aren't great, but they do a good job of fixing it for you. The music they play in here is horrible and on the weekends they have a house DJ playing a bunch of unintelligible crap that makes the dinner annoying, so we don't go on the weekends anymore. There are a couple (no seriously, 2 of them) waitresses who are good and have been there a while. The rest aren't very good. If you take a look at the management and then at the service staff, it is pretty obvious they were hired more for their visual appeal than their actual ability to wait a table. We lucked out tonight and got our favorite waitress here so no issues there. The alcohol selection is small, and drinks are way overpriced so don't come here expecting anything amazing from the bar. We do keep coming though because their sushi is all in all very good, just be aware of all the other crap that comes with it."}
{"text":"Good service from pretty waitresses - now that's what I'm talking about! Came here twice for dinner after work with my coworkers and we're now fans. 

You can sit at the bar or at a table. If you're in the mood, you can also sit at the hibachi tables in the back. They have big screen TVs and the restaurant is spacious and clean. I think it's cute that the waitresses wear shirts that say \"Sake to me\". 

The food comes out fast! One of my coworkers ordered a chicken and shrimp dish (because she's not into raw fish) and it smelled gooood! And her plate was huge!! While me and my other coworker ordered a smorgasbord of sushi, tuna tataki and seaweed salad. I satisfied my sushi craving for the night!"}
{"text":"My kids love going here for the tepanyakki!  The chefs are super fun to watch make volcanos out of onions and throwing rice balls.  The soup is so yummy that we copied the recipe at home."}
{"text":"First things first, my husband and I both worked at a similar restaurant in Vegas for YEARS. We know the culture & the food well. Our issue started when our waitress ran away anytime we asked questions. Literally would give a salty smile, no answer and walk away. I asked her about what was in the dressing and she NEVER came back with an answer. I have allergies so I needed to know. It took 30 minutes for her to bring my husband a beer (it was sitting on the counter) THEN, she brought...whisky glasses for the beer??? The roll my husband ordered was made wrong, when he complained about it she assured him it was right...he ate it anyways because she wouldn't stick around at our table long enough for us to rectify it. My shrimp entree the rice was so grossly over cooked it was horrible, the shrimp was so overdone it felt like chewing on a tire. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"We had a great experience a couple of weeks ago before heading to a movie. 

We sat at the bar and had drinks, sushi, and shared a teppanyaki entree. The bartenders were very nice and checked on us the perfect amount - they weren't avoidant and yet didn't hover. We never felt rushed. It was a delicious and relaxing meal.

Thanks Ah-So!"}
{"text":"Worst service, server couldn't remember drink order, brought dinner before appetizers,never asked do we need second round of drinks. Chef was great we had him before. Please work on your service!!!"}
{"text":"this was not my first Ah-So experience, i have been to other locations.. with that being said, i have to admit it was different. not in a bad way, just a little different, the wide open layout was actually kind of cool, and the hanging plasma tvs and sporting decor are just out of a eye range in case you do not want to see them. but set well so if you do want to watch the game or jersey shore reunion.

the wait was non existent, maybe because i went on a tuesday afternoon.. tho i think wait times should be addressed in a review, i would never dock a point for a long wait.. 

now onto the food, i ordered an iced green tea, it was good, some places use a different tea for the iced, but this is hot tea over ice, +1 for that.  i ordered the tuna tartar, as i try to as often as possible when i have sushi.. and it was good, but... not the best i ever had.(drake)
the soft-shell crab roll left nothing to be desired, perfectly tasty.  i even tried one of the vegas rolls on my table, it was pretty good, i usually do not eat those types of rolls, but i may again now =)
i ordered a sashimi sampler type item, it was delicious.. seems as fresh as you could get in Arizona.
for my main course i ordered a combination fillet and chicken.. it was great.. they give you two sauces with it.. fried rice, and just the right amount of perfectly cooked vegetables. +1 again 
and i did not forget the red bean ice cream.. very good =)
the service was nice, the staff were very personable and not drab like many you encounter mid week.


oh, and i also had a water.. which was filled up often.. and i read a horrible review that almost made me not want to come, i decided to go ahead and ignore his review..because with a name like \"Caleb B.\"  i was perfectly convinced he was an expert on asian food #sarcasm"}
{"text":"Eaten here a couple times,  food is ok at best, all about the temppenyaki. We show up on Monday night and they say they have a big party coming in and only 2 chefs, so we can't eat there. Offer us a normal table which the 5 of us accept. We're given 3 menus and 2 pairs of chopsticks. The small plates are dirty (attahced pic) and when miso soup came  (very good) we still hadn't received any napkins. Sashimi came out right after miso soup and before everyone else's meal. Still no napkins any only 2 chopsticks. Meals all came out and I guess they don't do salad anymore, too bad, that was good. We had to ask for silverware, chopsticks and napkins. Food was better than in the past."}
{"text":"I mainly go here for the sushi.  The sushi menu has become somewhat stale as the rolls haven't been changed up since the place opened.  On top of that the prices have gone up which probably keeps me from going back more.  

The teppanyaki grills are cool to watch but still a bit on the pricey side for me to take even a family of three to enjoy.  There's no question the food is top notch but it's tough to return frequently as the prices are higher than I'd like to afford on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Great food
Great prices
Great service 
Great environment 
only bad thing is it's always packed.. pick your battle ?"}
{"text":"I was seated quickly however no one told us that there were not enough chef's for the tables. So after 45 minutes of waiting we left because we had movie tickets.  (I have no idea when the chef actually came, my guess is an hour) I've enjoyed this place before, however, I doubt I'll come back. If a restaurant wants business they respect their customers. I appreciate it when the staff is honest with their patrons.  I prefer that they let us know ahead of time that there is a long wait and then I can make that decision myself if I want to wait or not. Instead I waited for 45 minutes thinking a chef was on his way any minute."}
{"text":"Monday night 8pm, the place is semi dead. I presume this is a real hit during the daytime with the close proximity to Luke AirForce Base. I do give good sushi reviews for other places and the one saving grace of this place is the nice decor. It also has a Teppan section though I did not see any chef's at the time. 

The sushi was average but extremely over priced.
Salmon Roll $6
Rainbow Roll $11
California Roll $5.50
1 Salmon Nigiri $8

The portions are not bigger or smaller than any other sushi restaurant, it is just over priced due to the location in the \"rich\" part of Avondale. So if you want mediocre sushi that is overpriced this is the place for you.

Darnell was our waiter and he was very good."}
{"text":"First time going here and the service was amazing! I love sushi but I don't like the seaweed and they have a soy paper alternative. It was the best sushi I have ever had. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"The sushi chefs were awesome. Super friendly and made great sushi. However, the place was dirty, we got served dirty plates and our server was not good. Service was terrible. And incredibly over priced. I will not return."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite sushi place. The sushi chefs are fantastic, & the manager is always on the floor, checking on customers and making sure everything is good. The yakatori is amazing! Best teriyaki anywhere. If you have sushi at the bar they give you a little courtesy cucumber salad too. Small but such a nice gesture that makes it feel special. Their drinks are great too. Parking is a bit of a pain at peak hours, but that's the only downfall. I highly recommend the Peoria Ah-So!"}
{"text":"Came here with the kids. We all had sushi and really enjoyed it. While the sushi was good, the service was even better. Our server was quick, friendly and attentive. We will be back."}
{"text":"Whatever you do make sure you are not one minute late for a reservation otherwise you will have a manager blow you off until you decide to leave almost 45 minutes later. Not enough cooks for the influx of customers. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"Went here with my sisters and our mom. They have you wait until there are enough other patrons to fill a grilling station...eek, wasn't too crazy about that, because we waited and waited and we were so hungry. 

The parking was ok, since we got there for an early dinner.


The Food Server was pretty slow with taking the order for beverages and then bringing the beverages...why the long wait? Did they run over the Target to get them?

The whole experience is about the Chef flipping veggies and meat around, then setting a mound of onions on fire like a volcano. The chef we got should had gotten a clue that we didn't really want to be part of his entertainment or butt of jokes. Just cook and be professional about it. (Yes, I've been to other teppanyaki places before to make a comparison).

I wasn't impressed with him flinging cooked meat at us either, one piece of chicken hit my mom in the eye and he stood there laughing about it. Seriously, WTH is so funny about that???

The food was ok, service was VERY SLOW, and the Chef was a bit sadistic."}
{"text":"This place is a Junior Varsity version of a sushi restaurant. 

1. Their sign outside says they open at 12 am on Sundays, how do they not notice that mistake???

2. Their menu has typos such as their drink list which says a drink has raspherry in it

3. I ordered a very basic roll, spicy tuna, and it was no good. It tasted like it was picked up at Costco or some super market. If you can't do a good spicy tuna then I don't want to try any of their more complex rolls."}
{"text":"Entirely doable for lunch. Stick to the bento boxes and/or $4-5 rolls. Was skeptical of the \"Chef's Choice\" sushi box but it was well stocked with quality stuff."}
{"text":"Dissociative Identity Disorder.  What used to be called Multiple Personality Disorder.  Ah-So suffers from it.  Badly.

Welcome Samurai warriors!  Here is your armor, katana and wakizashi! Cool. Oh, and across from it is a huge flat screen showing baseball...  ok... Thru the main doors and you meet the visual and audio cacophony of a liquor bar (replete with a display of all NFL helmets), sushi bar, cafeteria, dining booths and waaay at the back, the teppan tables.  Everything looks clean, shiny and new - I just don't think it all goes together very well.

The sushi:  the rolls we ordered were not great and I won't be coming back for it.  Way too much mayonnaise for my taste - it was an overwhelming flavor on ALL the rolls.  Didn't get any nigiri tonight - I'm thinking it'll be okay, since there's less moving parts.  ;)

The appetizers: The chicken wings were delicious!  Nicely seasoned, tender - but I typically don't go to a restaurant just for the apps.  But if I'm dragged here, I know what I'll be getting.

The service: Meh.  Took a long time for our app - it came at the same time as our sushi, and our drinks weren't kept filled, so...

The teppan looked pretty typical - but I can't comment on the food.  The show looked your average from across the room, but I believe it was cheaper than some other places, so maybe if you're looking for a value...

This place is close to work, and I might come back for a happy hour.  Or I might not."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with my lunch here. The vegetables looked like they came from a frozen bag and steamed in the microwave, the rice was very bland. But the worst part is my miso soup bowl had the inner paint peeling off in my soup. I pointed it out to our waiter and he just laughed it off and took the bowl away. He never offered to bring out a new bowl or soup and never brought it up to the manager who was walking around. I was sad because I was looking forward to this lunch out and it was just a disaster. I m disappointed to say that I will not come back to this ah so again, and I'm mad at myself for not just going to hyashi down the road. The only reason they got more than 1 star is that the sushi is still better than hyashi. Clean up your act ah so."}
{"text":"I can't believe what terrible service we had the other evening.  It was Sunday late evening, not crowded at all.  We came in for a late dinner and ordered mostly sushi. The waiter brought out my sushi and it didnt have the rice on the outside, which has never come that way before. I asked if he could have them add it to my roll and he just walked away. When he returned, I asked again and he said he would just have them make me a new one. I waited a half hour and finally asked if my new roll was coming soon and he just says to me, \"No, I just took your other one off the bill\".  I said \"well aren't they making me another roll like you said they were a half hour ago\"  He said NO.... So I said well can he and he said NO! Ok, taking it off my bill doesnt ignore the fact that I am still hungry and have been waiting a half hour for a meal that really was never coming. Everyone else at the table was already done with their food and I was starving. I think it was terrible service on his part to tell me they were making me a new roll and then never come to tell me they weren't until I asked where it was a half hour later...then say they just werent going to make it."}
{"text":"My sister wanted teppanyaki for her graduation dinner. We called yesterday and the lady said they stop taking people at 10:45. We got here at 10:05 tonight and TONY turned us away and wouldn't take our group of 6. There's 2-3 empty teppanyaki tables. Hope it was worth the 1 star."}
{"text":"A little pricey and the service lacked a bit. But super fresh and delicious. Will go back but hopefully with a better server."}
{"text":"Went in here for lunch today. My food was good but our waitress rarely came by to check on the table. Had to wait thirty minutes to receive the check after our table had been cleared."}
{"text":"Fun, Tasty, and Good for a Special Occasion...

Our family caught dinner here to celebrate my father-in-law's promotion.  Very nice crew and the teppanyaki was fun.  Our cook didn't have the skill level you see in Japan, Taiwan, or Hawai'i, but he was still good.

The place is clean and open.  Wait staff was very nice to our little girl.  Food was very tasty and stylishly presented.  The sushi actually tasted fresh!

Combined, the price seemed worth experience... and higher bill."}
{"text":"Out of all the places to go on Christmas Day, me and hubby chose the new Ahso Sushi And Steak that just opened walking distance from our place at the Shops at Norterra. Although having sushi for Christmas dinner was a little strange, I'm giving Ahso 3 stars because the food was really good. We had the complimentary miso soup, for an appetizer the fried scallops (yummy!!) and a platter of sushi that we both shared. (I can't vouch for uncooked sushi...that's just not my thing)

The only cons about the restaurant was that usually when I want the Japanese restaurant experience....ummm... a sea of flat screen TVs, a prominent full bar, and a wall of sports memorabilia doesn't fit into my \"ideal\" décor situation.  So we definitely would not recommended Ahso on Happy Valley for the atmosphere.  However, they did have Hitachi stations so it would be a great group or family outing. 

As far as the service, it was mediocre... I think the staff was just as confused as we were... was this a sports sushi bar or a restaurant? Def food for thought."}
{"text":"This review disregards the Teppanyaki portion of the restaurant... I have no idea what that's like, and if it's the same quality as the sushi, it's probably pretty good.

That being said, here's the explanation for the rating:

We went in a group of four, mostly because I wanted sushi, and it was close by. We had an easy time parking, probably because it was 3 in the afternoon, but we soon found out that was the only benefit to arriving at that hour of the day.

The hostess was very kind and cheerful, but instead of suggesting our available options, asked us open-endedly (and somewhat confusingly) how she could help us for dinner. I can understand this response when you walk into a retail store and there are lots of options, but really, when you're a restaurant host/ess, the most you're going to be able to offer is table, bar, or takeout (in this case, we didn't know what our options were, so it would have been good if she had offered some). Seeing a group of four, with a little brain power, one can probably infer we wanted a table. Perhaps a silly point, but it started us off on a somewhat awkward foot.

The waitstaff was efficient, but easily confused and didn't seem to understand our questions or requests very well, as though there were a language barrier to a degree.

The sushi (my dish) was well presented, fresh and tasty, but I had to pay $6 more for a meal that would have cost me less if I had come in (possibly) even a half an hour earlier. The menu listed both lunch and dinner items but had no indication when one menu ceased being served and the other started, but to the best of my knowledge, 3 P.M. is a very early dinner time even for people who eat early suppers.

For the price that we paid (around $18/person) the other food did not seem up to par. My husband ordered Chicken Yaki Soba, and our friends ordered and shared a dish of Chicken Teriyaki that was definitely large enough for both of them to share and had two sauces which were identified neither by the waitstaff nor the menu. The Yaki Soba was *ok*, and the vegetables that came with the chicken teriyaki were a little less than lukewarm and the chicken itself, in both the Teriyaki and Yaki Soba were dry. Needless to say, we had to pay dinner prices for food that had been obviously hanging around after lunch.

I might recommend this place as a good location for lunch sushi, because the lunch prices for sushi were very reasonable, and the sushi was very fresh and the chef seemed to know what he was doing. Even at a lower price the other food was not well made. Make sure you go specifically at \"lunchtime\" because otherwise you'll be stuck with dinner prices in the middle of the afternoon, and you might get better quality entrees than we did."}
{"text":"I loved this place! It was my first time there and I was surprised how big the inside was and I loved the neat and interesting aquarium they have. We ordered a couple different types of sushi's, an appetizer and two different drinks. The sushi was delicious and fresh, that we couldn't help but to put in another order of sushi. The price here was definitely and surprisingly reasonable for the amount of food we ordered along with the drinks. Our first experience there was great and I look forward to enjoying another dinner there soon"}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate my whole family's birthdays as we are all in April. We participated in the Teppanyaki presentation around the grill which was a lot of fun! The chefs are engaged and creative with the customers and we had great service.  They are constantly interacting with everyone and kept us laughing.  Portions were huge and we all took the rest home in boxes. A tad pricey but you get a lot for what you pay for. The Teppanyaki includes soup, salad and your choice of meat (shrimp, chicken, steak etc.) which then comes with fried rice and vegetables. I would say it was about $150-ish for 8 of us with appetizers (3 plates of  calamari) and the entrees. They entrees were about $25 each. Fun experience!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my kids, while visiting AZ. Good spot!!! The restaurant was clean,  the staff was nice and the food was good. It wasn't the best sushi I've had, but it was good. The restaurant also has a hibachi area (where you watch the chefs cook in front of you). This restaurant also has several tv's and a full bar."}
{"text":"I am way behind on reviewing, Seriously it's disturbing.

  So while I was in Arizona on busines I was dying for some sushi, i mean it was on the companies tab, and my boss him self said \" Treat yourself\". I figured I would kindly take him up on that offer.
 
 So I asked some locals where some good sushi spots were and I recieved all kinds of answers, when i asked \"Where is that\" The would give me the cross streets \" Oooooooooh its on main and 31st\"

 \" What do I look like an effing map of Arizona????\"

 Anyways, i figured I would try this place out it was walking distance from my hotel, (not that I would actually walk,)  I ventured out walked in apparently during happy hour which was nice. Their HH was cool, buy a beer get free hot sake. I hate hot sake but who I am to turn down free booze? 

The bartender was pretty cool, never caught her name but she  made she to get the job done. Even while she was distracted when her friends came by.  So thats where 2 stars came from, I mean she apparently was a master multitasker and that deserves a couple.


 The food was \"meh\" I mean  I was't impressed. but it did the trick.

{"text":"Great place, great entertainment at teppanki table and great food! Always love to come here with the family. The sushi is great too! Lots of options."}
{"text":"Met a co-worker for dinner and drinks. My favorite drink here is the Blue Hawaiian. So good! I forgot how noisy this place can be, so we had to talk a little louder. I got the teriyaki chicken and fried rice (no veggies). I liked it, but I thought the chicken was kinda dry. Certainly on the pricey side for what you get."}
{"text":"If you feel like spending the money dont choose this location. The food sucks conpared to the 75th ave location. 

Took long time to get food. Soup was horrible bland. 

didnt bring salad that came with our meal. 

Will not return to this location again!"}
{"text":"Having been a long time patron of the other Ah-So restaurants in the valley when I saw we where getting one in Goodyear I was giddy with excitement! I waited patiently for it to open and thought about what I was going to order for months before hand....Then the other night we decided to run out and grab dinner since our fridge was reminiscent of a bachelor pad fridge. We where going to run to Rubios or something fast but since we saw Ah-So thought what the heck lets just get something semi-fast...(Keep in Mind my birthday was coming up and I was planning to go and do a HUGE meal there for the bday celebration) so we walk in and I will say I was disappointed by the HUGE TV's lining the walls and hanging over the tables (excusemwa Is this a sports bar I walked into?) we are seated and given menus (we ate on the sushi side) I start perusing my menu when the server walks up grabs it out of my hands and says let me show you are menu..this is our drinks, this is our dinner items...ok thanks I can read you know! Then she takes our drink orders (its a Sunday night so two ice teas please) 10 minutes later we get our ice tea. Because the mood is already going down hill we decide to order something fast and easy. My husband orders what in reality is fish and chips the waitress tells him that it is fresh fish with a tempura batter. I order Miso Soup with an order of California rolls....we wait another 10 minutes which turns into 15 minutes I ask the waitress about our soup (usually the first item out) she says one second 10 minutes later our entree and sushi come out. Still no soup. The fish and chips are Gordon's fish fillets with a sweet sauce (Not fresh fish or tempura batter) the chips are curly fries which were still cold and partially frozen in spots. She didn't give us any chop sticks for my California rolls. Mam can I get chop sticks and our soup please...oh yeah 5 minutes later we get our soup but still no chop sticks..we start eating the coup and my husband discovers a very long very black hair in his soup...My hair is about 2 inches long and his is even shorter...Mam there is a hair in his soup and I still need chop sticks...oh sorry she says I will bring you new soup. So she comes back with two bowls of chicken broth soup which tastes like Swanson's chicken broth warmed up. His had a mushroom in it mine had nothing but broth..(we never asked for this kind of soup, I don't know why she brought this soup out) still no chop sticks...at this point we are ready to leave and she asks if there is something wrong with my California roll..yes there is something wrong! I don't want to eat it with a fork! Finally I get chop sticks! Then all the sudden she shows up with the salads (also should have been served at the beginning of the meal) this whole time I can see 3-4 servers sitting around staring at TV's and laughing...I spent a year waiting tables while I went to school I know how much work it is but I can not imagine giving the service we where given and expecting anything more than 15% for a tip! I can say my B-Day dinner has been moved because I will not go back to this place until it has been open for at least a year...maybe they can work out the kinks!"}
{"text":"Drove 40 minuets just to come here and I'm so disappointed. As soon as I walked in, the receptionist Sky was a total freaking b witch she was totally snobby and made it really clear that nine thirty was the cut off for food and drinks when it was barely eight thirty. Made me feel like I should of walked away (which I should of) customer service sucked, didn't bring what we asked for or took to long to bring it when there was only two other tables. Food was nasty by far worst fried rice and veggies. Not to mention dry chicken. Other than that the sushi was all right and the manager was really nice but never waisting my gas again. It ain't cheap"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Ah So and I was pleasantly surprised.  We have our die-hard favorite sushi place but decided to do a Tepanyaki dinner for an early Father's Day dinner.  We were a party of 7 and shared a table with another party of three.  The show was fun and light hearted and the food was above average.  The soup was more like water but the salad was very tasty.   The wait staff was very attentive and responsive to our requests.  

Total bill for 7 was $272 without a tip."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about... 

Food was decent - only complaint would be my lobster was a bit rubbery.  Everything else was ok.

Service was average. What you'd expect really. Drinks weren't empty often and when they were, it wasn't for long. 

We'll be back, but not in a hurry."}
{"text":"Horrible!!!! Second time I go in there, tonight like the first was a disappointment. No tables available because of short staff. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I arrived in Phoenix last night and was craving for Sushi.  Coming from California where there are abundance of excellent sushi places, I didn't know what to expect here in Phoenix.  I used Yelp to find the closest to my hotel and it listed this place but it only had 2 stars out of 50 reviews.  Oh well, there were other places around but I really wanted sushi so I decided I'll try it out anyway.  Let me tell you, I had a good night and  I gave it five stars because of below. 

1.  Ambiance is really nice.  Wide open space and perfect lighting. 
2.  Host was very friendly and all smiles.  Directed me to a favorable sized sushi bar.  
3.  The waitress was really nice and very attentive to my needs. 
4.  Sushi chef \"hooked\" me up with nice piece(BIG!!!) of fresh Hamachi Kama.  
5.  The sushi was excellent and the Hamachi Kama was grilled perfect.

Overall excellent service and great food. 

I'm so glad I tried this place.  Definitely going back a few more times to try the other rolls before I head back to Cali.

Update:  Went back two more times for dinner and same experience as the last time.  Everyone is very friendly and the sushi was really good.  I'll be back in month and will surely visit them again."}
{"text":"This used to be our go to for sushi and teppanyaki then the sushi started slaking so it was our go to for tasty teppanyaki.
The service has declined over the year and I invoked our 3 strike rule. Tonight was strike 3. 
The miso soup was like water with a couple mushrooms and green onion no tofo no flavor. The Bowl was scratched up in the inside and I think a saw some orange coating floating in my soup. My salad had ice cubes in it.
Our sushi order arrived AFTER the chief started cooking, keeping with the trend of hurry up get them cooked and out if here.
My steak was ehhh and scallops we bland and the veggies also lacked flavor.
We are bummed out that we will have to drive to arrowhead area or the 55th ave and bell location to get the quality service and food we deserve.. did I mention the server was not attentive I was waiting at least 10 minutes for another beer  which at that time we were ready for the bill and leave... Sorry Ah- So you have lost a few families if long time customers"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing! Especially the happy hour menu starting at 5pm everyday. The Sweet & Spicy roll is to die for. Plus the staff is super helpful, friendly, and efficient. LOVE!"}
{"text":"This review is in regards to an incident Friday the 13th in January 2017. Iconic tattoo and piercing was holding a special for that day and it was obviously busy due to that. Joe came by told people we needed to move cars and a few of us parked on the no parking dirt lot across the street as he threatened tow trucks and said our cars would be ok over there even with the signs posted. The way it all went down was very unprofessional and at some point the tattoo shop closed up due to police being called. So countless patrons were not able to take part in the tattoo / piercing special due to management at Ah So being rude. Will not spend my money there anymore."}
{"text":"Not the best, but not the worst. The look of the place is nice. Pretty big. reminded me of Benihanas with their private tables. But as others have said, the design is a bit odd. It's kinda pricey. I didn't care for the customer service. Could have been better.

{"text":"Ah-so is located in North Norterra next to PFChangs and Dicks Sporting goods.  The restaurant was clean - could use some updating on furniture and decor. 

Came in for Happy Hour - which the pricing you can't beat for selected appetizers and beverages.  The California roll was good, nothing to get crazy for. What surprised me was the Wings on Happy Hour they were pretty darn good considering at a Sushi place.  

Service - The hostess was sweet and speedy in seating. The servicer was nice and speedy in getting refills and serving food."}
{"text":"Not sure why the reviews have been low.  Every time we go the food is amazing along with the service.  Whether sushi or hibachi you are sure to have a great time.  Our favorite place."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  Warning: there are TWO Ah-So restaurants within a few miles of each other.  We actually had reservations at the OTHER Ah-So, but by the time we got parked, into this place, and realized that we were at the wrong place, we stayed.  We only had to wait 5-10 minutes to sit at the \"cooking table\".  Our chef was entertaining, and the food was delicious.  We were pleasantly surprised to find that they had a $5 sake bomb special that included a large container of sake and a HUGE Sapporo beer - enough for four sake bombs.  Our experience as a whole was great - I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and they had a good priced lunch menu.  I had the teppenyaki and it was good.  The chef was ok nothing too entertaining like Sapporo or other restaraunts of this type.  I ordered a sushi roll for appetizer that our waitress totally forgot about.  Luckily the meal was big enough I honestly didn't need it.  For the price it was good food and worth the price."}
{"text":"I went to this ahso a year ago and got shitty slow service. The same people I went with we all went again yesterday. The service is super slow my entree I got was cold. My entire family is never going here again also my friend who was behind us had problems and isn't coming again either. This restaurant is overpriced An the service should make up for that but don't."}
{"text":"We've made reservations for 8 o'clock. Didn't get in til 9. Water and food took forever. It was just a horrible experience. The food was bland and there was something in my water. :( I was really disappointed."}

Great food, Great Vibe, and Great Service
What other things can you write about that stands out more than these three?

Try their Happy hour! SAKE BOMB!
Don't forget to order their spicy crab rolls!"}
{"text":"ARE YOU KIDDING ME! how can you hate this place.
Tasty Japanese food melts in your mouth at every bite!
The price is reasonable and you can't find any other Japanese food that is this good!
I can't believe the people who write bad review about this place, I don't think they know how Japanese food should taste!
I highly recommend Ah-So! Definitely a treasure in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Took a seat at the bar.  
Was served right away.  Service was good. 
Ordered miso soup.  Asparagus roll.  Dragon roll.  Food was good the dragon roll had a lot of sauce but it was tasty. 
The atmosphere was noisy and I was in a separate room from the main dining. 
17.00 was my total.  It was quick good and inexpensive I would go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely hands down the worst sushi I've ever had. I wouldn't  even say the food was fish-stick grade, much less sushi grade.  The wasabi was bland, my salmon roll was warm 'fishy' smelling and the order came out so fast I swear it had to have been pre-made.  If they offered me free sushi for life I still would never go back. Never. Yuck!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! What a fun place! Great vibe, sweet staff, upscale Japanese authentic taste, reasonably priced. Seafood Udon noodle, I highly recommend the Sake-Rita  \"Chris\" was great with recommendations. This is now a weekly stop!!!"}
{"text":"Edamame is not traditional, gyoza is over fried and flavorless, sashimi is old and flavorless except the salmon which tasted like tuna?! Maybe some cross storage going on. The sushi rolls came wrapped in thick dried out seaweed and non-sticky rice. The waiter did not ask why we ordered one item, took a bite, then ordered another and repeated four times until giving up. We had a table of food for 2 people and were never asked how the food was. My drink was empty throughout the majority of the dinner, which was long due to poor service. 

The place is like sitting in a meat locker, freezing cold. I guess they keep it that way for their $1 drafts during happy hour so you can drink more alcohol to warm up. 

Although we finally got some heat once the Teppanyaki was lit up...after watching 8 people sit at the grill for over 45 minutes, some chef finally went over and took care of them setting the grill afire and scaring the heck out of two kids sitting there until one of the kids cried. Nice job!

I was confused by the name: sushi and steak? But inside, they have football helmets and Japanese art? Talk about an identity crisis. 

Im very disappointed. I was certainly hoping this place would be amazing but they were an amazing disaster. Save your money, save your time, order sushi from safeway! Seriously."}
{"text":"Ah-soooo  this place is not as good as I was expecting.  I went for sushi and was not impressed.  I went twice hoping I was there on an off day.  I sat at the (liquor) bar and ordered.  I have had better sushi from a grocery store.  The fish was \"fishy\" and dry.  I ordered one of their speciality rolls and they didn't have the fish and replaced it with a cheaper variety and still charged full price for the roll.  Not cool... It is an ok place to grab a drink with friends but there are better places for sushi. I wouldn't be a good judge for the rest of the place as I have not experienced the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"We got to the restaurant at 1130am and were greeted and seated at the tepenyaki table for lunch. Mind you, this was our holiday lunch with my admins and we have been to this location previous times and have always had an excellent experience. 

First thing, our table chef lacked enthusiasm... We joked, asking if we woke him and he laughed, but still no energy... We hoped for a show, but were told they don't do shows at that location. He obliged our request with a small show, but it seemed like he broke some rules or something. 

Secondly, the chicken was tough, not moist or soft, very chewy and hard... Told our waitress about it and she spoke to a gentleman, we assumed was the manager, but he didn't come over to ask us about the food... as the final bill was delivered to us, the manager came over... We did notice that he seemed to avoid us until the bill was due... He discounted is 15% off our bill which was nice. 

Experience was not good, food was sub par and the Vegas Roll tasted fishy... We will most likely not go back to this location... It used to be a great location and convenient as it was only a few mins from the office... Hope this might help them to work out some things with their location."}
{"text":"I'm basing my 4 rating based on my last dine in experience. My first time back in 2011 wasn't too memorable and had teriyaki chicken take out another time and wasn't too impressed. Most recent time I dined here with my friend on a Tuesday night at 5:45pm and was seated right away. I ordered calamari (2nd attempt) and shumai off their happy hour menu. I really enjoyed both!! I don't remember my first try at calamari being as good but glad I gave it another shot! The steamed shumai was also very tasty and it came with dipping sauce. I also ordered caterpillar roll (I think, it had avocado and eel in top) and I also enjoyed that. I hope to go back soon! I highly suggest for others to try."}
{"text":"Te service sucks ! I used to come here a lot , the service was great. One day we went out for dinner and brought someone who has never tried sushi before and it toke 45 min for the \"new girl\" to come take our orders! What a bad impression. What impressed me was that chef know more the the waiters . He knew we were waiting there so long he give us extra food!  So I came In today to give it another try , crazy enough we get the same chick !!!!! Ugh like really ?! Ya she is new but someone needs to have her back just in case she messed up !! But she did . She forgot my husbands order , our drinks .  Everyone else in the table was done eating by the time my husband got his food. She cant divide checks ! I recommend going to hayashi    :)"}
{"text":"Ok, I have eaten at the Ah-so on Happy Valley road several times and this is horrible in comparison!!!  I ordered the shrimp, which is what I have gotten at the other location, and it was practically inedible.  Everything just tasted 'off'.  To top it off,  I showed up with my handicap grandmother, exactly on time for our reservation, with the other people in our party literally pulling into the parking lot.  My grandma has trouble standing and getting up and down.  I explained this to the hostess and she would not seat us!  I even said I would order for them (even though they were just a few moments behind us).  Very bad experience at this location and will never return."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to dinner for our 10yr anniversary and had a great time starting from the hostess helping answer our questions, the bartender was fast, great also with answering our questions about the apps. The manager came up to us to make sure all was good as it was. The chef at the table was very entertaining and the food was great. We will go back and often!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the negative reviews are about.  This is a very nice restaurant.  The inside is almost brand new and very clean and modern looking.  The bar part looked very cool but we sat near the sushi chefs to \"watch them work.\"  The service from our watiress was great, but the sushi chef had the personality of a dead moth.  When I handed him the order he just left it there.  I didn't even know he was working on it but suddenly he handed me some sushi.  The food was good.  The prices are pretty standard for sushi.  It's expensive.  That's pretty much par for the course.  I'm sure there are cheaper places, but as I said, this place is nice.  I'd reccomend sitting in the bar or at a table for sushi.  Don't sit at the sushi bar to watch them work.  It's boring and awkward. Otherwise a decent sushi place.  Can't comment on the tepinyaki because I didn't do that."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here about a month ago and we loved it. We went back around 4:00 and were really disappointed. I ordered filet and lobster which turned out to be 9 little cubes of steak and about 10 pieces of rubbery lobster. My husband ordered sushi and didn't get his sushi until after I finished eating. We watched my husband's sushi sit up at the sushi station for 10 minutes. The waitress was nice but really didn't seem to care. She knew that serving my husband so long after I served was wrong but didn't offer to adjust the bill which was $66.00. Really disappointed.  When we left there were 3 hostesses and what looked like a manager who said nothing as we left. Needless to say we will be trying some other sushi places in the area next time."}
{"text":"Overpriced Japanese restaurant.  Food is average at best.  Nothing special, the price is what's keeping me from coming back.  There are way better Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food is fantastic. We tried the seafood ceviche which was well prepared and very fresh. The Ah-so Roll was surprisingly good, and a great value. 

The service was poor - the place was pretty empty, but there were staff just standing around. We had to wait quite a while for service. 

That being said, the food is good enough to come back for. I would recommend."}
{"text":"On Monday around 11:30am, my aunt, niece & I stopped by to check out the new restaurant that had opened in the Happy Valley plaza (the newer one w/ Best Buy). After going past the first set of doors, we were greeted by a Japanese armor suit behind a glass case. It was interesting to look at and my 7 year old niece got a kick out of it. 

As we walked towards our table for 3, we noticed that the restaurant was HUGE and only a handful of tables were occupied and 1 family at the teppanyaki table. 

I decided on the steak lunch, my aunt had the chicken & scallop lunch and my niece had salmon sashimi w/ sushi rice. The fried rice was pretty tasty, the pieces of steak were juicy and the grilled veggies were good. For dessert, my niece ordered green tea ice cream. It ended up taking way longer than we expected so we had to flag down our waitress to remind her. Three heaping scoops drizzled w/ berry & chocolate syrups were soon brought out. 

Teppanyaki restaurants are rarely ever very authentic, but Ah-So is pretty good for what it is. 

3.5* but rounded up for the good service and cleanliness. The busboy was very prompt w/ clearing our empty bowls/dishes and refilling our waters."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss depending on what your expecting. This is a great place to spend time with a group, kids, or a date, but isn't as classy as many make it out to seem to be. It would be nice to have a formal dress code, more updates to the interior, and the hours updated outside, but overall the food is great. This is Japanese and making a reservation is key to getting a decent time at the grill. Lunch has discounted prices so before 3 is the best time to get food to me."}
{"text":"not worth the trip .  if you are in happy valley and want chinese go to pfchang.  this place  lacks service and quality .  the tuna wrap was slopply made.  the fried rice was like the fried rice at  the mall ."}
{"text":"We came here for teppanyaki and we definitely got it, but it was definitely difficult. We had a party of 11, but unfortunately they do not accept reservations on the weekend, so we had to wait. On top of that, they will not even place you on the waiting list until all of your party is present. Hey, I understand it, but it is so inconvenient.

Our cook was great. He had a personality and made it fun for all of us. They do provide a salad and a soup for everybody, but our soup was cold when it was brought to the table. Our server, however, was nice about it and brought us more. Overall, I feel like I've had a better experience at the one in Peoria."}
{"text":"Food is excellent!! Ambiance, cleanliness and service way better than Hayashi.  The fried spring rolls were the best I've ever had.

Been eating here regularly.  Once a week.  My favorite restaurant in the west valley.  Total disappointment tonight.  Slow service.  Food not up to usual standards.  Very disappointing.  Food took forever to come and when it did it was cold.  Seriously thought about refusing to pay."}
{"text":"After not having a real meal all day, this was awesome choice to chow down. We were quickly seated and had a nice waitress. The restaurant was pretty spacious with a separate bar area, a tempanyaki seating area, and of course booths and tables. Also they have an outdoor patio as well. The restaurant has a modern and contemporary look and feel to it. We had the lollipop roll, and 3 others that I can not remember. All were really good, but the lollipop was most memorable. We also got miso soup and salad before or meal, which was a nice touch. We were stuffed and satisfied. The prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"18% gratuity on a party of 8? I wouldn't normally complain but when my drink is empty all night and the server doesn't speak English it's disappointing."}
{"text":"I was in two minds whether to try this place given the very varied reviews. We had a good time, but I would say that was due to being at the Tepanyaki grill table and thus the grilling being done in front of you.
The food was good if unremarkable and the service was fairly efficient. It was also pretty popular - we dined early on a Saturday evening (6pm) and by the time we came out at 7.30, there must have been 20 people waiting for tables."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for really good hibachi try to find another place but if you don't want to travel to far this place will do. The atmosphere is ok , the service was ok and the food was pretty good. The cook was just going through the motions and wasn't really trying to connect with the customers at the table. The real positive and this place is the sushi, it was flavorful and refreshing."}
{"text":"I must be visiting a different restaurant then these other people, because I've been to this Ah-So location two times and have, thus far, been very satisfied with the outcome.  The only thing I can think is that I'm going out for Nigiri Sushi, not Sushi rolls.

If you want good Nigiri Sushi, including some excellent octopus (really really good) and some amazing Red Snapper, Surf Clam, and Tuna, this is the place to get it.  I've never had a problem with bad service, and after reading all of these reviews, I was looking for it.  My drink was refilled, as was my wife's green tea.  It's a little pricey, not somewhere I'm going every week, but if I want sushi and I'm feeling a little flush, this is the place my family goes for raw fish."}
{"text":"This particular location is a major disappointment. I work nearby so I've given it several chances, as I love Japanese and have had good experiences at the Bell road location.

I've been here 6 or 7 times and have had worse than poor service each visit.  I've never had a drink refilled, I've never received my food in less than 35 minutes, and I've never had anything other than marginal sushi.  I have many friends that have given this location a go as well and they all had the same experience.  

There's not much else to say.  If you're thinking of eating here, give it a pass and hit up the original Bell road location.  The last time I was there the service and food were both great."}
{"text":"I love Sushi! My wife and I just moved into the neighborhood of the ASHO on Happy Valley road and we were looking forward to going. Service was fine as we were early about 5:30 on a Friday night. The sushi however was priced high end while the quality of the sushi is low end. I ordered the Rainbow roll which at other places consists of a crab or spicy tune roll covered by an assortment of fresh fish and avocado. However at ASHO they cheap out and use a standard California roll covered by an assortment of avocado and fish.

Everything else we ordered was average with small proportions and higher price than other great sushi restaurants in the area. For north west Phoenix I recommend  2 other places; Sakana on 59th and 101 has great sushi with huge portions of fresh fish for the same prices of ASHO. My other recommendation is Tokyo Lobby on 59th ave and Bell road in front of Wal-Mart. Yeah I know, but don't laugh till you have tried their sushi; it is awesome! They are a little cheaper than ASHO and Sakana and the portions aren't as large as Sakana, but I do believe they make up for it with flavor and their unique rolls (don't pass them up.

Overall rating:

ASHO (Happy Valley road) -----overpriced under deliver with small portions and cheaper ingredients in their rolls

SAKANA-------Excellent sushi and proportions a little pricey but worth it

Tokyo Lobby-----Great sushi, great prices proportions are not as large as Sakana"}
{"text":"The worst Ah-So experience . The wait , the cold; what seemed to be re-heated food, the service ! I would much rather drive to another location, then to have this experience."}
{"text":"My cousin and I came here last night and it was terrible! We came all the way from Mesa due to us loving the Ah-So out in Yuma. We arrived around 8:30 and the hostess named Sky, made it very clear to us that the cut off for food and drinks was at 9:30. We got sat at our table and it was filthy, our food took forever (there were only two other tables w people) and once received our food the rice was extremely dry and so were the veggies. Overall the customer service was of good. I do not recommend"}
{"text":"Katelyn the host was really nice and fast. Called in for a pick up order and she made sure I was satisfied and had everything I needed. Sushi here is really good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Japanese restaurant.   I've been coming here with my daughter for years and it's become almost ritualistic.   Occasionally,  depending on the number of guests, the food is a little inconsistent. However,  on that rare occasion they always are very kind and eager to make things right."}
{"text":"Great sushi, great service, excellent hot tea. Offers a wide range of sushi delights, steak, and apps. Our waiter was brilliant and the atmosphere is top notch. Tempura is highly recommended. Plenty of tv's, wide open bar. I have no complaints, it was an excellent first stop on my business trip to Phoenix."}
