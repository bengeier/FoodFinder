{"text":"This place is located in an industrial area and so it is mainly a lunch place catering to local workers/business owners/tradesmen. It's a hot table / restaurant.  The hot table has several different choices that change daily and usually has fish, chicken, pork, and beef options. I had fish (sea bass to be exact) with rice and potatoes. Food was great but a bit pricey. They have a daily special tho for around $10. Staff was friendly"}
{"text":"2 second Summary: small portions, expensive, but good, flavorful chicken.  Full review:  Let me start by saying I'm torn on this review.   Sina's is a take out and sit down Portuguese restaurant  (I wasn't able to take a picture of the sit down side, but it's a cozy family run restaurant). On a Friday at lunch, the tables were relatively full, and the corporate type were in there talking, enjoying their starter bread and meals.   I was in a rush so I decided to try the Portuguese chicken meal, which comes with rice and veggies, with added hot sauce.     When she handed me the meal, I was immediately disappointed. It was a tiny piece of chicken, and the rice and beans looked like something you can grab at your office or school cafe. At first glance, for a $7.50 lunch I was not happy.  When I got back to the office, I first tried the rice and beans. Bleh... it didn't only look like your high school cafe rice and veggies, I could have sworn had been magically transported a decade back in life and was re-living that food.  Only thing was I hadn't sat in a time-machine hottub so I knew this was the present.  Hey, at least my cafe had awesome apple pies, i would have loved to be able to have one of those again.  Anyway, I got to the \"meat\" of the meal (pun intended) and bit into the chicken. Now, as tiny as this piece of chicken was (I finished it about 4 or 5 bites), this piece of Portuguese cooked dark meat chicken was delicious. It was tasty, flavourful, moist and just downright good.    So this is the dilemma, how to rate this place? The taste of the chicken is a 4/5, but the value prop here is a 1/5 given you won't enjoy the veggies and rice. In fact, I'm still hungry as I write this. Other meals looked also as expensive, the \"daily special\" which let you choose two sides and a helping of fish, chicken or other Portuguese looking dishes was $9.75 + taxes, expensive for a take out lunch in Mississauga. Average the scores out and you get 2.5/5, and I've had a long week so I'm bumping it down to a 2.   So would I go back? Maybe if it were a sit down meal, I could stuff myself with extra bread and whatnot.  But I likely  won't be back for takeout unless I have a serious craving for Portuguese chicken, which is far and in-between."}
{"text":"Different from the Portuguese restaurants located in Brampton and Mississauga, but I must say for a resto located in an industrial area, food is good but I believe is all rotisserie and doesn't have the grilled flavor. I must say, the sauce they lather on the chicken is delicious."}
