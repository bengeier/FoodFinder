{"text":"The sonoran hotdog was love at first bite. I want to try every taco, but only tried the carne asada one and it was pure enjoyment. The quality of meat was juicy and tender. I loved the atmosphere of the place, the local artwork on the walls, and the location. Not far from my work, so me and my coworkers go for lunch and it's quick enough service. I will have to come back on a Friday after work to try their margaritas because they look tasty. Overall cool place, delicious food! Oh, and accessible parking right by the building."}
{"text":"maybe I'm biased because I live across the street... but I love this place! always a good deal on delicious margaritas, excellent artwork, great food options (small and large plates) and sweet games and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Paz is amazing! We love the carnitas burrito and the fresh guac! I can't wait until they get their restaurant back, thanks for continuing to feed Roosevelt row amazing Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"$3 house margaritas, hella good tacos, and friendly staff?! This place is awesome."}
{"text":"I didn't like anything about this place except that Fayuca was laying down some fresh jams outside of the restaurant. First of all there was a long wait for a table, which I don't mind at all for good food, but there wasn't any. The burrito I had was very \"meh\" and could be purchased at any Mexican themed restaurant, Applebee's or 7-11. But what is the food without the atmosphere?? Well there was an MMA fight on the TVs so a bunch of idiots were watching other idiots beating each other up for money. Wasn't exactly the best place to talk to friends but if I wanted to fight someone, this would be the first place I would go to. Why? Trying to get service there was impossible and by the time someone came to take our order, they were acting like we were an inconvenience for them, I guess they wanted to watch the fight instead of make money because I was down to do some drinking that night but after how long it took for one drink and a  mediocre burrito, I took off.   One star for Fayuca jamming out on the patio, that was cool."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. Was pleasantly surprised by the calamari and cactus tacos! Cactus is something I wouldn't typically order but I'm glad I did. The bar staff is great and creative. All staff is attentive and the vibe is cool and the local art is a nice addition. I will be recommending this place to friends."}
{"text":"Went here once to try it out and it was certainly interesting. They have $4 margaritas which were pretty decent and very yummy tacos. I also tried the sonoran dog which was very tasty. Overall a nice experience but the food was pretty $$. Tacos are around $3-5 each. You do pay for quality however, just not so much quantity."}
{"text":"I love coming to Paz! Everyone is always so friendly and welcoming especially the bartender Hanaye! She already knows how I like my drink and is super sweet! Love this place and seeing Local art!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!!!!!! Foods great and bartenders are fast but service in the dinning room is awful i recommend siting in the bar !!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Food was great and service was amazing. Everyone was so friendly! And...$3.00 margaritas everyday!!! Yes!!! And they were great! Tons of parking in the back!! New favorite place to chill in downtown!!"}
{"text":"First of all i come from food mecca with Michelin awards to back it up, so i have flavorful taste buds. With that in mind the Tres Leches French Toast is crazy yummy!!! Also bottomless mimosa's for 12 bucks is such a deal. I love the atmosphere and art in this place. Im definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Out of the park, they where amazing on each position style of truck, customer service, and of course the food.. I will be returning to the truck.  Must try.."}
{"text":"Great food, casual atmosphere, cool artwork, good music and outdoor games!! The prices are extremely reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! All of the food is msde fresh and taste delicious. The atmosphere is great! There is unique artwork. If youre not satisfied with your meal they will gladly remake it the way you like it. The owner cam and greeted us and was a very nice person. All of the food is delicious and fresh 5 stars doesnt describe it well enough!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, very good reinvented gourmet tacos with awsome handmade tortillas (just came from Mexico so I should know). Had the pork belly and the nopales taco, both great! The pork belly was the best I've had, crispy texture and the creamy fat flavor exploted in your mouth with the first bite along with the pickled red onions, didn't even add salsa to it just lime. The nopales was a mix of nopal and shitake mushroom with pickled white onions in a dark chile dressing, if you like spicy this is great. My husband had the carnitas taco too and said it was the best of all three, the other member of our party had a street corn and it was delicious also. It's great for late night dinner, we arrived at almost 12 AM. Looks kind of like an art gallery, lots of street art and we got to see one of the artists paint a mural on one of the outside walls. Dog and bike friendly. Love!"}
{"text":"Paz Cantina is by far one of the best restaurants in Phoenix.  The food is exquisite & thoughtfully prepared, and the service is amazing. I feel like I have been frequenting Paz for years due to the feeling of home that the staff imparts,  however November will mark their one year anniversary.  Today,  while enjoying the fabulous brunch, it occurred to me that we have never had a bad customer service experience. In fact, the service has consistently been impeccable. The owner, Michael, is often onsite, and his pride & obvious care for the restaurant can be witnessed in a simple short conversation.  I wish the team at Paz much luck as they move into their second year; I know that other fans will agree.  Here's to another great year Michael & team!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Paz Cantina!  Love the ambiance!!  I'm so excited about this new place.  Staff is friendly, the food is de-lish, and the drinks are awesome!  Service is a little slow, BUT, it is a new restaurant.  Surely, it'll get better with time.  Do visit, everyone!  You'll love it too.   Review with updates will be posted after my next visit.  Stay tuned."}
{"text":"Although the food was excellent I would not go back because when I questioned my bill the manager threatened to kick my ass and actually put his hands on me. He was rude and insulting, if he was my employee I would fire him immediately."}
{"text":"I've never been compelled to speak to a manager at a restaurant for what I've considered to be awful service until I visited Paz this past Sunday.   A group of friends and I went to brunch on a Sunday here, hoping to have what is now widely considered to be \"Sunday Funday\". On a recommendation from a friend, we decided to try a new place that has a good deal on mimosas. Our server, a young woman, greeted our table and recommended we try their unlimited mimosa deal for $12. \"Sure!\" we all said enthusiastically. In the time she left to service some other tables, she apparently overheard one of my party talking about us having drinks the night before. Our group was quiet and polite this whole time, with no behavior indicating we were anything but a normal group of friends going out to brunch and enjoying drinks on our day off. Our server returned to our table, without our drink orders, and very rudely proclaimed \"Clearly you all are still very intoxicated from the previous night, so we won't be serving you our unlimited mimosas\". Shocked and appalled by her audacity, and not wanting to make a scene, we refrained from arguing and settled on having just one drink and getting on our way. A new server then began to serve us with no explanation as to why there was a switch. We thought this to be a bit strange, along with the fact that none of our other requests were being brought to the table...even though this new server took the orders and told us they would be right out.   At this point I felt as if we were being treated poorly, so I decided to speak to a manager about why there was a switch in servers without explanation, as well as to inform her that the previous waitress made an unwarranted, abrasive comment to my friends and I. It turns out our new server was the manager, and her explanation was that the previous server was uncomfortable serving us. Another insult, completely unacceptable. The manager then proceeded to smirk and laugh at my complaints, although she did mention she would speak to the previous server about her approach. I am not exaggerating when I say that I have never felt so disrespected at a restaurant before, and I have unfortunately been to Applebee's.   The food here was good, but the abhorrent, disrespectful, and neglectful attitudes of the staff overshadowed the entire experience and deserves no more than 1-star. Shame on Paz Cantina."}
{"text":"terrible service. terrible management. absolutely no respect for neighbors- play music at extreme levels until 2 am. never will give business to them."}
{"text":"Was part of a private event here last week, and it was great! It took a little while to get the event area set up, and it seemed as though they were a bit disorganized, but once everything was settled this was a great place. $3 margaritas were good and cheap, and they set up a taco bar for us with rice and beans, which was very delicious. There was also a live band playing and the whole place has a very chill vibe, which is nice compared to some restaurant/bars in Tempe and Scottsdale. I would definitely go back to try their normal menu."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a new Mexican Cantina since our favorite place  changed their menu.  The first thing we noticed was the ample parking . This is a real rare find in Phoenix and makes PAZ a really appealing choice all in itself. The decorum   was well done and the presentation was aesthetically pleasing. We ordered the queso  as an appetizer and really enjoyed that not only did it have a zesty flavor , but also kept the same  creamy consistency throughout the time it took us the finish. As an entree we ordered  the pork belly tacos and the carnitas tacos. The  pork belly was lightly fried and definetely a future favorite. The cilantro and lime  really complimented the carnitas well. We ordered the house margarita which was strong and well made . Definetely worth the price."}
{"text":"I have been to Paz Cantina before a few times and always received great service, and it is a wonderful neighborhood bar/restaurant with an unbelievable selection of local artwork both inside and out. It's the type of place that makes you want to bring your friends from out of town along to show them how awesome downtown Phoenix can be. However, last night's boxing match is what finally prompted me to write a review for Paz. Our group had waited fairly late on Saturday afternoon to pick a location to watch the fight...even though on the website it looked like Paz was sold out of reserved tables, they were able to work something out for us when my brother went up there in person to ask about availability. There was a brief mix up as far as which table was ours, but a manager (maybe the owner?) ran up to help us out and to make sure that we were well taken care of. Even though the place was packed with people and buzzing with activity, you would never have guessed they were busy based on the level of service we received from our server - she stopped in to ask is how we were doing every time she walked by, she kept the drinks and buckets of Tecate coming, our food orders came out quickly, she got our tab closed out within minutes after the fight finished, and she did it all with a smile. The whole waitstaff was fantastic too, checking in on us to make sure that we were in good shape. As for the food, we had chips and 2 salsas which were both tasty, and we ordered bean/cheese/avocado burritos and the special Pac-Man tocilog burritos made for fight night, all of which were fantastic. Thanks for putting on a great fight night, Paz - we'll see you again next time! :)"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have been going to this place since it opened, and we love it! The food is wonderful, the service is awesome, and the Ping-Pong tables are an added bonus. We've become regulars. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here last weekend with my girlfriend and will not be coming back. I have never experienced such piss poor service in a restaurant. As we enter, I walk up to the hostess and ask if we can grab a table for 2.  Hostess: There is a wait right now Me: Okay no problem. How long will the wait be? Hostess: Sigh...I'm not sure. You will just have to wait Me: Okay....  Right, because it is totally unreasonable to ask for an estimated wait time... Anyways, we are eventually seated and I thought to myself \"Okay, that hostess was pretty terrible but maybe our server will be good\"  NOPE!  It took 20 minutes just to take our drink order. Our server wasn't attentive at all. Every time we asked for a refill, our server would roll her eyes at us. It seriously felt like we were inconveniencing her. And then in the corner of my eye, I see our server talking to another worker and pointing at us. It was clear they were saying something negative about us and it made us feel very uncomfortable and confused.  As far as the food goes...it was just okay. We ordered some tacos and they were pretty bland. I've had bad service in restaurants before but this was the first time I legitimately left pissed off.  I award you 1 star Paz Cantina and may God have mercy on your soul."}
{"text":"Micheladas on point! Tinga tacos are by far my favorite. Staff was attentive & they let us vape :) my new spot for sure."}
{"text":"Games AND great food?! Yes please! Stumbled into this place hungry and tired and couldn't believe the super cool ambience and fantastic service."}
{"text":"Love the cheap tasty tacos!! This place has a great selection of tacos and great happy hour! Staff is friendly and chatty. I love sitting at the bar for good convo and munchies!!!"}
{"text":"We grabbed a bite for lunch at the food truck in Roosevelt Row. The food was amazing. The owner recommended one of the specials, the Phoenician with fried egg added, the ahi tuna taco, the porkbelly taco, and the corn on the Cob so that's what we ordered. Everything was amazing. The seasoning and the sauce on the corn were perfection. Ahi Tuna was my fav out of tacos."}
{"text":"Tacos were amazing, I would recommened the braised pork and carne asada tacos. Kevin was really friendly and chatted with us for a bit and he makes good.margarits. also the art in the place is amazing!"}
{"text":"It was awesome! Christopher is the best server ever. Knows the menu well. He recommended all the best items. Do yourself a favor and go here now! Dooo it! Now!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.   The ambiance, the skirt steak.....the MARGARITAS.. They are exactly how I like them, strong & cheap.     Sunday is ALL DAY HAPPY HOUR?  Yes please. Bottomless mimosa's were incredible one particular Sunday, I truly felt like our server was like a Wimbledon Ball return girl with the speed and perfect timing of her mimosa pouring skills.  TOP NOTCH.  After finding our own seats (we had an awkward sit down but after being shuffled to 2 other tables) and the chips and salsa showed up, immediately rectifying the situation as we began our affair with the chips and it's salsa sidekick.     Any longtime downtown resident was terribly concerned about any business being successful on this seemingly jinxed corner.   PAZ knocked it out of the park.   Hella5 on the stars."}
{"text":"The tacos are delicious! The shrimp are my favorite. Taco Tuesday is the best. The margaritas are ok, sometimes too bitter but good for the price. The only reason this place doesnt get 5 stars is the service."}
{"text":"Great food. Great alcohol. Great prices. Went all over Phoenix. This was the best spot. A must. Oh and great music too"}
{"text":"First off, this fits perfectly into the Roosevelt Row scene. It's painted by truly talented local artists and the musicians are great! Prices are very comparable (in many cases cheaper) than some of the other local Mexican/Southwestern restaurants in the area.   Everybody's palette is different, so keep this in mind when reading mine and others' reviews. I personally enjoyed the salsa. Others have said it was \"watery\" or \"not thick/chunky\". Well, if you were to go to Mexico, you'd find salsa in all different textures and varieties. Paz has chosen to go with a less chunky, and still very authentic Mexican salsa - which to me is a breath of fresh air since I'm always eating Pico de Gallo at every other Mexican/Southwestern restaurant I go to. People don't realize that many times food from other cultures that is introduced to the U.S. becomes \"Americanized\". I liked their Guacamole - definitely in my top 5 favorites  This is a great place for a group of Friends to go have some fun, great drinks and food. If you'r looking for a traditional Sit-Down quieter restaurant, don't go to Paz. This place is fun, up-beat and can definitely get loud - especially on Thursdays, Fridays & Saturdays when they have live music. They are very true to the deep & rich culture of Downtown Phoenix.   I LOVE that the \"Sushi\" sign is still up there. Even if it just has yet to be removed, I think it adds a little bit extra quirkiness - which is what Downtown Phoenix is great at doing.   The owning partners and staff are so grateful and nice to each guest. They are also really accommodating! I was looking at the menu, but craving a burrito. They took the Carnitas Torta and made it a burrito for me! I'm really picky about 3 things when it comes to Mexican food: Guacamole, Tortillas, and the Meat. Their handmade Tortilla was so fresh and AUTHENTIC! Not like those white flour tortillas that you can buy at the grocery store, but a real, honest to goodness hand made with love tortilla that I could swear they ran across the border to get it. The meats are fresh, the ingredients are fresh, the drinks are awesome.   I never experience negative service with the staff, but in any case there could always be room for improvement or to be making sure of oneself when your in a customer service position.   I love this place and love sending my guests and clients there.   Final tip: Make sure the restaurant you're going to will fit what you're looking for. It's sad to see negative reviews on places that could have easily been avoided if people just knew what type of place they were going to. Do your homework, ask the locals, ASK YOUR CONCIERGE. Don't go to someplace just because they're Mexican food, or a casual setting, or american food, or vegan...find out more about the restaurant and find a place that fits what you are trying to accomplish other than just eating."}
{"text":"The Sonoran hot dog was super yummy and the tacos (Carne asada and fish) were very good. Will be back to try tortas next time!"}
{"text":"Decent beers on tap, excellent craft cocktails all of which are very fresh and original. The staff is attentive and knowledgeable. The tacos are great! Amazing fresh tortillas and nice spicy salsa. I would have to say the cactus was a good surprise, I've never eaten it before and it was tasty but the calamari taco is my favorite so far. The vibe and art are really chill and cool, definitely my new spot downtown."}
{"text":"I went on a Friday night with high expectations after reading some of the Yelp reviews. When we arrived we had to wait 10-15min for a table (not a long wait) and the staff kept apologizing for the long wait time, which I thought was nice. We sat down and the waitress looked like she was in a huge rush to take our orders so we ordered the house marg and some guacamole. I was excited that the marg was only $3 but came to figure it was probably due to the undetectable amount of alcohol content... Overall the waitress was rude,didn't give us napkins after asking twice, and then food was meh. Would not be eager to return."}
{"text":"What I love about PAZ: 1.   The food is fabulous (I'll get into more below, but if you are there for brunch, try the Tres Leches French Toast). 2.  Convenient location and plenty of FREE off-street parking in the lot behind (off 3rd St). 3.   Great service.  Friendly staff.  Good music (although a little loud) 4.   Great community vibe.  The space is open, friendly, with a patio area that includes ping-pong tables, chalk for kids to make side-walk art, and a bean-bag toss.   We have been there on two occasions.  The first was for Sunday Brunch (11:45am) and we had kids with us.   Between us all, we tried the Tortas, the Chilaquiles, and the Tres Leches French Toast - which, by the way, won the prize as the table's favorite.   We also ordered $4 Bloody Mary's and and $11 bottomless Mimosa.  The drink prices left us with the feeling that we time-warped back to 1990's drink prices.  The next time I went was for the $5 Taco and Beer special.   The taco's are street-size (read: not large).  But they are so unique and the combination of flavors are wonderful.    Definitely do the build your own taco platter (that's not what it's called, I just gave it that name) from choices like Chicken Tinga (a slow-cooked chipotle chicken), Carnitas, Carne Asada, Pork Belly (which seems to get rave reviews),  fish and a Nopales   I mentioned earlier that we went with the kids in tow for Brunch.  But the space and owners are dog-friendly as well.  Dogs are welcome on the patio (although we did not see any on either occasion), and they have dog-treats on the ready for your fury friends.  I love how they are building a sense of community with the space and how they are so welcoming.  We look forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Ordered via Uber and the cheesy fries were fantastic , the street corn was a bomb of flavors, the cheese, salt and lime bursting in your mouth. Sadly the meat in all of my tacos was so dry and over cooked it ruined my experience. Way to dry and chewy, I pretty much had to throw them out. This has nothing to do with the delivery but simply over cooking the meat."}
{"text":"So, had high hopes for this time around at ol' 1011 N 3rd,  the place where restaurants go to die. To be honest I hope this one doesn't, and based on the reviews and how full the patio remains in the afternoons, I don't think it will.   I would just like to share our less than satisfactory experience.   First of all, it was happy hour and we expected some good deals, we didn't find any. The drink deal was $1 off. Whoop-di-do! My friend ordered a sangria and it tasted like old boxed wine. So then for food I though I would order fish tacos, and I go one (1) goddamn taco for 4.75. Is this Manhattan?  No it's 1011 N 3rd street, where restaurants go to die. Gimme a break. Won't be back."}
{"text":"First off, everybody should know there's lots of free parking available just north of the restaurant, off of 3rd Street.  There are both paved and unpaved lots.  So, do not be deterred by the dismal parking situation on and around Roosevelt St.  Venture forth and try Paz Catina.  For dinner, for brunch, for drinks and light bites...you won't regret it!  I've been to Paz 4 times now, and on my 2nd visit I was greeted like a regular, with high-fives from the host.  I've had tacos and margaritas for dinner, and chilaquiles and bloody Mary for brunch.  I had no complaints with anything I was served.  I have tried the pork belly, carnitas, and shrimp tacos, and all are delicious and unique.  The pork belly is hands-down my favorite.  On my 3rd visit, I asked my server about the street corn, which had been recently added to the menu.  He went back to the kitchen to get the answer, then returned and told me they didn't have it ready yet.  No big deal; I ordered tacos!  As I finished my meal, the owner slid a gorgeous ear of street corn, dressed to the nines, in front of me.  It was FANTASTIC!  We had a brief conversation about his approach to the menu (quality, in a nutshell).    The ambiance is, as others have mentioned, wonderful.  Very urban, with interesting art and interesting people.  There's a family-size table for large groups, and a room off to the side that, I assume, could accommodate a private gathering.  There's an inviting, dog-friendly patio.  I love the open kitchen, and actually saw a staff person photographing a plate on the counter before it went out to a table!  The music is good, and the TV is unobtrusive.  I am a huge fan of this place, and can't wait to go back and try the dulce de leche french toast!!!"}
{"text":"Michael Reyes is a class act.  He does things well, and his new Paz Cantina food truck is no exception.  He is introducing empanadas, and I can't wait to try them.  He had duck empanadas today, but I didn't learn that until I'd already stuffed my face with two delicious pork belly tacos!  Oh, and he has a new location that looks to be long-term, next to Modified."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite taco place ever. No matter which tacos I choose it's an orgasm in my mouth, and you can't go wrong with the 3 dollar house margaritas. The artwork in the restaurant is very cool as well, and is all local. I love that they're open until midnight, it's a great place to go after a DBacks game. I live in Gilbert right by Joyride Taco House and I'd much rather make the drive to Paz if I'm in a taco eating mood."}
{"text":"I had no idea you could actually mess up Mexican food until I visited this place, everything was flavorless."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing drinks and an even better atmosphere, the ping pong tables aren't bad either"}
{"text":"I went with my husband and my best friend on Friday to check this place out. Initially, it was hard to find because First Friday was in full swing. Once we found it, we were greeted right away and seated at a nice table with a lot of room. (I hate sitting elbow to elbow with the table next to me!) The decor is really nice. Very artsy and fits in perfectly with other downtown restaurants. Between the three of us, we got practically everything on the menu. Our favorite thing on the menu was the queso. So freaking good! We couldn't figure out what cheeses were in it, but it's really yummy. We all got the house margarita, which was super fresh and had real lime juice, not a crappy sweet and sour mix. And they were only $3 a piece!! Can't beat that. We had excellent service-no complaints. We are really looking forward to going to Paz again when they have the full menu!"}
{"text":"Got to the hotel after a long flight from the east coast, and stumbled upon Paz Cantina.  The pork belly tacos were excellent.  I also was able to chat with the owner, Michael, and he was very welcoming, and explained the history of that dish and its Filipino roots. Great spot for local Phoenix cuisine."}
{"text":"First Friday grand opening perhaps not the best idea. Surely for those of us who live downtown can relate that all restaurants even the longer opened ones can have bad service. The service was great regardless of the kaos. The environment was great and I felt relaxed even on a 1st Friday restaurant madness. The tacos were good too they are small but perhaps with a larger menu it won't take too many."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever!!! I had the carne asada, fish, and pork belly. They were all amazing but that pork belly was UNREAL!! Washed it down with a \"Dangerous Liaison\". Fantastic meal!"}
{"text":"Pros: $3 margaritas, awesome nachos, great service!  Cons: None.  So glad that this excellent space was taken over by an area-appropriate hang out spot.  Paz has some of the best nachos around, my weakness.  Good selection of street style tacos, and good drinks.  The house marg is a great deal, and although the bar is small, they have a couple TVs playing random music videos or the occasional game.  Great place to plop down for an easy weekend brunch if running around downtown.  Parking:  You park kind of behind and to the side of the building.  The parking lot entrance is an immediate right off of 3rd st just north of Roosevelt after the traffic light; 3rd street is a one-way street heading north.  Or, if you want to act like a local, turn north on 5th street off Roosevelt and take the first narrow little left, which will lead you to the same lot.  Thanks to the staff, and to DJ who made us fans on our first visit!"}
{"text":"I had previously rated this place a 4-star, but unfortunately I have to say after my last visit I will not be going to this place again.   The food is still good, and the drinks fairly priced, but the service we received on our last visit was some of the worst I've ever received. Our server's name was Noelle, and she was truly awful. We showed up 2 hours before they closed, when plenty of tables were still sitting, and she treated us like absolute garbage. She hardly said three words to us all night, and seemed pissed in general that we were there. When I asked if they had any chips (not angrily...just a question. If she interpreted it as anger, I was careful to be nothing but kind for the remainder of our time there), she seemed taken aback and upset. When we ordered a trio of dips, she never brought us any chips. In fact, she spent her time mopping around our table while our trio of dips went cold. Eventually, as she walked past us for the hundredth time without asking if we needed anything, my boyfriend asked her to please take the dips back. She didn't ask what was wrong with them or offer to get us any chips, or even apologize; she just took the dips and dropped us a check.   I'm not sure why we received the service we did, and I'm pretty upset, as I previously liked this restaurant so much. I am in the service industry as well, and was ecstatic to find a restaurant that served food late. However, I wouldn't return to this place if you paid me, after the service we received.   To the girl who served us: I apologize if you dislike your job. I apologize if you were having a hard day. But have some pride in your job. And if you don't like your job, then leave.   If you're going to go to this restaurant, apparently you should go before 10pm. They market themselves as a late-night hangout, but the servers don't seem to understand that."}
{"text":"Paz is a cool spot for solid tacos, a very tasty kale salad, great chicken tinga and good music.  Drinks and beer are just ok, even when asking for higher end/quality margaritas. The staff is generally very friendly and tries to help.  However, more consistent and high quality service from bartenders and wait staff would result with higher rating.  Worth a try."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the second time in a week. First experience was great because the server was great. Something changed last night, a Thursday night. First, the music was blaring and inside patrons and the staff could not communicate with one another. I suspect the same thing was happening with the front and back of the house. I ordered a kale and quinoa salad and pork belly tacos. When I say ordered I  mean screamed directly into the ear of my server. In a reasonable amount of time a runner brought my tacos. I thought it strange to bring the tacos before the salad, but whatever, I was hungry. Good so far and tacos down. They were good. A half hour later still no salad and no server to be found. Ten minutes later my server walked through the room, spotted my salad in the service window, looked at me, looked at my salad, looked at me, picked it up and set it down in front of me mumbling something about \"sorry nobody brought this to you.\" I pushed the salad aside and told her I was ready for my check. She brought the check straight away, and yep, salad was on the check. So basically I paid seventeen bucks for two pork belly tacos.   Way to go PAZ, you got my $17 bucks last night, but they are the last of my dollars that you will see. A bit of advice. One, turn the music down, it's a restaurant not a night club. Two, servers belong in the front 100% of the time, not in the back ignoring their tables.  I'll be interested to see who opens this place next when you're gone."}
{"text":"Came back to give this place another try, stupid me..I gave this place a 1 start because yelp doesn't allow a 0 .  I can sum this place up in a few words...  WORST SERVICE.  The servers had absolutely no personality.. The place is very modern and I love that. Working in such an upbeat place you would think the employees would have an upbeat personality, or any personality for that matter. To the server who always wears a pony tail and white tank( don't know your name because you never introduced yourself) , if you hate your job so much, get a different one. We couldn't even tell her our food came out wrong because she ran away. Servers, do yourself a favor and write down the orders because our experience shows that you can't remember them. My company had the enchiladas with no onions, first thing she tasted was onions.  Food wasn't all that great either, disappointed.."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in downtown. Food is GREAT!  and the environment feels like home. They always have music, and the service is great. There's a bartender who's a little rude, but the place is great."}
{"text":"Wow what an great cantina! My first time here and I will be returning for sure! I love the chill atmosphere here! They have some awesome art work and I just got great vibes from the whole place! I'm amazed they weren't busier its that great! The food was delicious (shrimp taco, calamari taco which I forget what it's called, and flautas) they also make the quacamole to order yummmmmmm ! The staff was friendly and make you feel welcome! Also I had a sangria which to b honest I could do better it was just eh! But the second drink was soooooo good! So it made the sangria better! My overall experience was just overall great! I'm going home with a full stomach and happy to spend my money here!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice and the second time (Late October) for me was the last time. Food is ridiculously over priced and nothing special about it. They claim authentic Mexican food, in reality it was really a more upscale version of taco bell. $3 plus for one taco, I can easily find a REAL Mexican restaurant that way more food than what paz offered. Myself being a Mexican, I did not find this place appealing nor tasty."}
{"text":"Stopped at  the bar last night  at First Friday. It was a little crowded but managed to move right up to the bar. The bar tender ignored me for ten minutes so  I raised my hand and  he makes some sort of rude comment \" I can see you and I'll get to you when I can\".   Finally he offers up some help and the guy next to me gets pissed because I cut in front of him. I was there before he was so how did I manage to cut in line? The bar tender slips over and takes his order instead of mine.  Hey, I don't need to pay good money to be insulted. I left and I ain't going back."}
{"text":"50 minutes for undersized overcooked tacos. Another hour or so and I could've gotten them straight from Mexico."}
{"text":"Can we say handmade?  People that care to create a truly welcoming and comfortable place to visit. Pork belly taco melts in your mouth. Carne asada taco has just the right amount of pepper tang. Nopales taco is a great non meat option. Try the custom thought of drinks.  Don q splash is very refreshing. The group starting this up is really trying to make their own stamp. Only 3 min walk from the high rises and ASU. Come by and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Paz Cantina shows up as being temporarily closed, which is disappointing. The food was good, the staff was above average and prices were fair. It is located in an area of downtown that is really starting to show a hint of big city flair.  The \"greeter\" could really try harder at getting people seated in a timely manner, but I'm sure checking his phone is way more important.   All in all, if you came for good food, Paz would have impressed. If you're a \"trendy\" neckbeard, or the type of person that wakes up every morning looking to be offended, or you came to sit for hours over one cheap drink to be \"seen\" as hip.....move along to your closest Starbucks."}
{"text":"as a guy that eats out on business travel 4 nights/ week, it is rare for me to hit the same place twice unless it is worthy.. this place is worthy!.    on taco tuesday every taco is a buck off and the margaritas are just two bucks.. i was in for 3 tacos and 2 margs and out for less then  $15.  i then returned night two and the owner recognized me (thanks Mike) and he recommended the calamari taco and tinga taco.    This place will now become my tuesday go to and has diverted me from my hamburger quest that is usually my tuesday. p.s it is just a 10 minute walk from downtown hotels"}
{"text":"Not a good place for a quick weekday lunch.  I had heard good things about Paz from my coworkers who went to Paz as a large group a couple weeks ago. Sad to say, today's visit did not live up to the expectation they set.  My group of 5 people ordered the appetizer trio (queso, guac and beans), chicken flautas and a total of 5 tacos. About 30 minutes into our wait, I was told that the papas taco I'd ordered was no longer available. I said I'd be happy with 2 of the Nopalito tacos.  After 45 minutes we had received nothing - not even the appetizer which I would have expected to come out fairly quickly. We finally received (almost everything) about 5 minutes later. My 2 nopalito tacos were still not ready and I received 1 of the 2 after another 5 minute wait. My second nopalito taco was delivered 5 minutes later. The second taco included several pieces of steak I had not ordered.  When I informed the waitress, she took both of my tacos back and I again waited for about 10 minutes before I got 2 fresh new tacos. By this time, I was pretty uninterested in eating them. I did have one, which was alright but not great, and took the other home to enjoy another time.  In all, the food was only okay and the service was extremely slow. The kitchen and wait staff seemed unable to handle the lunch rush. Disappointing to say the least, I think I'll take my dollars elsewhere in the future.  P.S. the wall of moss out front is cute but strange. I did my part and gave it some water. Like the interaction. Would have been more fun if I had left with a positive experience."}
{"text":"This bar is a constant noise disturbance in the neighborhood. They have a band outdoors on the patio playing super-loud music with the speakers facing the street, IN CLEAR VIOLATION OF CITY BYLAWS."}
{"text":"Sadly, I will not be adding Paz to the list of restaurants that I frequent. We were on our way to Phoenix Theater to see a play. Decided to stop at Paz for dinner prior to the show. Luckily, we gave ourselves plenty of time.   The service was down right horrible. The hostess sat us at our table and we were basically ignored for 15 minutes. After that, it took another 15 minutes to get the drinks we ordered. So, 30 minutes into this affair and we had managed to get some cocktails.  I would comment on the quality of the food or post photos of it, but sadly after almost 90 minutes mine had not arrived. Lucky me, it did arrive just as we were leaving. I took it to go and lovingly placed it in the trash can at home.  The owner was kind enough to comp out meal (or at the parts of it we got).   Without question, there are better places to find Mexican fare in Phoenix. I suggest you try them.  N*Joy..."}
{"text":"Food was good, but not worth the wait. We were the first people in and it took about 20 minutes to take our food order. I could understand it if was busy, but it wasn't.  Server started clearing our table before everyone was even done eating.  I'm only giving this three stars cause the service wasn't good, but the food was good."}
{"text":"Overpriced for just-okay Mexican. You're paying for being part of the RoRo (Roosevelt Row) scene, such as it is. Skimpy portions. My carne asada torta had hardly any filling. You can get as good or better at most taco.stands. And $7 for guac? Yeah, it was decent guac (if somewhat undermixed) but $7?  My husband asked for flour tortillas for his tacos - big crisis. The only flour tortillas are for the burritos. Can't have them for the tacos as they're too big. Really? Mex place with no flour tortillas for tacos? After much fluttering by the waiter, husband changed order to burrito. Crisis averted.  Our waiter was dumb as a post and running around like a loon, then interrupting and hovering over us while we were talking. GO AWAY UNLESS WE CALL YOU.  We had to yell to place our order and to talk (!) to each other, as the music is cranked up to pick-up-bar levels.  Certainly won't be back."}
{"text":"Overpriced for what it is - a Taco shop.  Pros: Ambience is kind of cool. Large patio. Above-average cocktails. Good place for a large group if you want to hang at the patio and enjoy some drinks / nice weather.   Cons: Food is sub-par. Expensive for the quality (not the freshest ingredients). Certain items were way too salty and over-seasoned.  In summary, unlikely to return unless food quality improves drastically.  What we had: Cocktails  Fish tacos (mahi mahi) - ok. Calamari tacos - above average. Veggie tacos - salty and unimpressive. Chips - stale and not fresh. Salsa - above average.  Service: above average but certainly not as good as other similar restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"We came to Paz for the first time in a few months for some quick food and drinks. Unfortunately, after being seated and receiving chips and water, we were ignored for about 30 minutes and decided to leave. This is the first time we have actually walked out of Paz, but we have noticed their service becoming increasingly slower over our past visits. Bummer, because we absolutely love the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere, and great prices makes for a very enjoyable Saturday evening in downtown Phoenix (and Valentine's Day, no less!) The first thing I noticed was the vibrant art work on the walls. The second thing I noticed were the chips. I love Mexican food but am not usually a fan of the stale tortilla chips that most restaurants offer. Not these. They were warm and fresh with just the right amount of salt. For dinner I had the veggie torta and for 8 bucks, it was a great deal: fresh veggies, slightly grilled bread, and enough to take home for the next day. Do yourself a favor and get the grilled sweet corn, which was fresh and flavorful. I am told the chipotle chicken tacos were also quite good, but keep in mind that these are street tacos. One won't be enough for most people. Drinks were reasonably priced -- $3 for the house margarita and $5 for the michelada (made with Tecate, not a watered down American beer!). Service was a bit slow, though. We didn't mind because we were in no hurry and maybe it was just a fluke. We will find out because we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm so surprised by the negative reviews but have to assume was first friday compounded with opening day that made it crazy. We went in on Saturday afternoon and it was just awesome. The service was beyond great. They were helpful with getting our game on and were super attentive. The cocktails were creative and delicious. The house salsa is phenomenal!!! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"First, the corn-on-the-cob is pure evil....in a good way. OMG I just wanted to...EAT ALL OF IT.  The food overall was delicious and I love, love, love the taco's!  The fish taco is excellent and this crazy good vegetarian taco with poblano peppers, corn, avocado etc it was so friggin delicious, but I did take it up a notch and added chicken...don't judge me!   My server was cute as all get out, friendly and her menu knowledge was on fleek, but it took a while to get food initially.  After that, all went well.   Yep, I'll be a regular."}
{"text":"Finally! A fusion of my dream street tacos! The ambiance is casual and the staff def make you feel at home. I came twice, once on first Friday with the Fayuca concert and again to watch Thursday night football. This is a great place for everyone, depending on the night and the occasion it caters to every palate. First off-the Pork Belly! It is PHENOMENAL, by far one of the best pork belly dishes I've ever had. The Fish taco is also up there in taste. The calamari and shrimp were good but were nothing out of this world. Then the drinks.... I had the Margarita Popper, which is the margarita with jalapeños, sounds insane but the sweetness, tartness, mixed with citrus and jalapeño heat was Amazing! If you aren't into spicy drinks, the margarita bramble was sweet and on point. Make sure you ask for Vanessa as the drinks were perfectly made. On first Friday they also had a special on house margaritas for like $3 bucks! Make sure to stop by and order the margarita popper and the pork belly tacos!"}
{"text":"I loved Paz Cantina, after two businesses not working out at that location, I feel this one will be there for long! 3 things I loved: the tacos, the street corn and the ambience! My bf and I had a really good time and we will definitely come again! I would give 5 stars, but our waitress forgot our drinks and she took a little long! You must try :)"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to just hang out with friends. The wait in line to be seated isn't worth it. The food is average but less than what the prices that are posted. Music is great, and the people are awesome. Just make sure to eat before coming here!"}
{"text":"Great place for late night food. College crowd/seen, usually loud. So that is what to expect. But, with that being said, It is great food & drink. I love go there b/c everyplace else has no late night food. It is one of my go to late night food and drink. Fun place."}
{"text":"This place is FaBuLouS!!! We walked in & we're immediately greeted. Two glasses of water & chips & salsa within barely sitting down! LoVe! Restaurants forget the importance of water now a days & I always have to ask for it 3 times! So this was a delight to me.  The chef/owner? (Guy with a curled mustache) explained the menu very well. Everything made fresh, tortillas & torts & even their buns are local.  My boyfriend had the Carne Asada, Pork Belly, Taco Del Mar & a Tinga tacos. He said they were all delicious!  I had the house salad with Carne Asada & the street corn. Being on a diet...salads can become so drab! Not this one! It was sooo FreSh! & the ingredients & dressing went so well together! I could eat it everyday!  Chef/Owner guy checked on us again mid meal & chatted with us as we were in town for work. Told him we wish we lived closer as I would come in often.  He gave us a flan dessert that they grind fresh coffee into that was PHENOMINAL!   If you are in the area DEFINITELY check this place out! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Alas! My fourth time at Paz :-) I came here for lunch on the patio, and overall it was a great experience for me. I had a kale salad with all sorts of fun stuff on it (it was one of their speciality salads). Delicious! For me, the service was great. Exactly what I was hoping for. However, my guest's order was incorrect...so, for her she was not super impressed, and had to settle for her incorrect order because we were in a time crunch. Accuracy, is important!   Overall, I would come back. This is my second review, and I had to share some of the feedback. It's just too good of a location. However, I hope the servers can work on their accuracy! You guys got this, and I know you'll be great."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love, love, love this place because well I LOVE tacos & local art. My first try the margarita I had was cheapy but tasted cheapy the Paz margarita was just too sweet. But hey that's me & my taste & super high expectations.  The next trip in we tried tacos & the local Kilt Lifter was good (as always). The salsa was spicy, smoky & tomato chilie goodness.  The third visit was all about the bar again (we were there to see the Phoenix Cruise Crew) & tried the one love margarita & too sweet for me again. AYE when am I gonna learn? They had some new Lalo Cota pieces that were already sold sadly but was fun to see just couldn't bring it home with me sadly. The fourth visit blew me outta the water. I tried the Popper margarita on a Monday evening & I freakin' love, love, loved it. The spicy kick saddled the sweet concoction into submission I wanted a bucket full but settled for one. BTW it was on special for $5 so I showed great restraint. Then the queso was yummy melty goodness. I got the pork belly taco & fell head over heels for that too. The hubs had a yummy ham & carnita torta that had the traditional slightly sweet, soft & crusty roll. The carmitas & ham or jamon were appropriately charred & delish. The pickles brought the tang & it was great too. So what did I learn kiddies? Order the tacos ALWAYS & the Popper is my new homie. Oh & try to find an extra belly to eat it all. I left so full I could have used a wheel barrel for my trip back to the car. Can not wait to go back & have some more. Maybe I'll even play some yard games."}
{"text":"The for now Paz is on wheels which for me has been kind of fun to follow. I psychotically love the pork belly deliciousness coming out of this truck. Annnd the carnitas are to die for. So flavorful & juicy. The fresh churros changed my hubs idea of a churro for life. He'd never had one not from Disney so now he's both saved & ruined. Michael is always kind & willing to meet his new customers aka followers with a hand shake & a smile. Everyone on the truck is quick on their feet & pleasant. I loved the concept & fun atmosphere he created previously at Paz & personally can't wait to see what he comes up with again when they re-open. I just hope & pray he can keep the food truck too. Just because I'm selfish I guess."}
{"text":"Been here twice now while visiting good'ol AZ and its hit or miss. The first time was way better then the second visit, not sure if they just had an off day the second time around or what but this second time was a little disappointing. The Avocado pineapple margarita was two thumbs down, tasted like cheap tequila and water and even though it had chunks of pineapple I have no clue where the taste disappeared to. The first time we went was because of the pork belly and yes it was good the first time, this time it tasted like old, over fried carnitas. The street corn was sour, waaaayy too much lemon or lime juice on it And the queso appetizer was straight up gross! Better off just heating up some cheese whiz. I'm giving two stars because the first time was better, hoping this second time was just an off day and service is pretty good."}
{"text":"Love this place! My husband and I stopped in for a few drinks and bite to eat Friday night. The atmosphere is high energy, with exceptional attention to detail; like throwing a fun modern flare on their delicious cocktail/tapas menu. We can't wait to go back to experience the full lunch/dinner menu!"}
{"text":"My first impression of the place was positive.  I thought the ambience of the place was cool and my server was definitely friendly and attentive throughout the meal.  As far as the food, it was just ok.  I had two tacos-the chicken tinga taco was tasty but also very spicy.  There was nothing wrong with it- I personally don't like tacos that spicy but I know some people do.    The carnitas taco was a bit bland to me and too chewy.  It needed a more tasty and creamy sauce to complement the meat.  The  chips and salsa were good but not great.  I will probably return to try some of their other tacos."}
{"text":"Paz is one of my favorite spots in downtown Phoenix. The servers, bar tenders and cooks know how to show you a good time  I like the tacos and salsa the best. However, there isn't anything on the menu I don't like"}
{"text":"$7 for Guacamole - This is high for Phoenix. If you look at the menu for a mexican place just off of Rodeo in Beverly Hills a scoop of Guacamole about half of what you will get at Paz is $3.95 (http://www.fridarestaurant.com/beverlyhills/menu/dinnermenu.pdf).  Common logic would dictate that the guacamole would be cheaper in Phoenix than Beverly Hills.  The tacos were ok, the porkbelly was a little old and basically just placed on a tortilla. They might be better served by purchasing a package of trader joe's pre-marinaded carne asada as well.  The hero of the night was the green salsa. That was pretty good. Your work is cut out for you to compete with Crescent Ballroom and La Santisma.  Perhaps the best strategy would be to forgo the waiter service and just order at the counter. That would drive down the costs of a wait staff."}
{"text":"The Sonoran dog was bomb. The cholo fries just as good. The horchata was even better but the Jamaica was one of the worst I've ever had."}
{"text":"I'd give a zero for service if I could. Food isn't bad but they are really awful with service. They acted like everyone was drinking just because they didn't get the orders right. A female took our order and then later had no idea where our order was. Inconvenient and the owner was not pleasent. He was cussing, rude, in our face and irate. Would not do business here again."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Once for breakfast.- then for an evening. Paz needs an identity. It's Trying to Be too many things.  I had steak & eggs for breakfast. It was good but the serving was small. Service good...but would b nice to be able to tell who works there. The fence around the property definitely does not add to the ambiance. Makes property look closed or under construction. ..not welcoming at all. A more professional demeanor would be nice for the staff. Sorry you're overworked during special events.  (management? ) so is this a Sports Bar?   Club? Restaurant?  Art space?  I get the location maybe dictates the eclecticism - however sometimes focusing can be better. Particularly since it's the same as all the places trying to do that same thing in the same area. I may try again, but with all the mexican food restaurants here...focus would be good here. The location / parking alone gives a huge advantage. It should be used to the advantage of the space."}
{"text":"I went here on first Friday and have to say it was some of the worst service I've ever received. We waited 30 minutes for a table because the hostess thought we no longer wanted to sit down and eat. The manager walked by and quickly got us seated, but once seated we waited another 10 minutes when a person in our party had to ask the waiter for water and menus. Then another 20 minutes for them to take our order to which we never received napkins until asked. The food was awful, dry, and bland we had the carnitas, carne asada, and calamari tacos. The only thing that came out somewhat edible was the calamari. We will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Dropped by here last night on my way home from the gym for a quick snack. Ran into my fellow Yelp Elite Nader in the bar and enjoyed a carnitas taco and a cold beer. The taco was really good and flavorful. I saw some nachos go by I have to try at some time in the future because they looked really good. Service was over the top, everyone in here is really awesome. I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"I had a great brunch with my 6 relatives here recently. The atmosphere was great. Parking was easy, back dirt lot, and the service was excellent. It was a bit more pricey than I thought it would've been but overall I had a great experience.  The traditional Mexican meals were good and their specialty drinks were excellent. Don't rack too many of those up though cause it's costly! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Love the fish tacos here!! Also the carne asada as well as the Street corn! Yum!  I'm a super big fan of street tacos, and some good chips and salsa for starters, and this place has it all!! Must try if you haven't already!!  The only thing missing would be for them to have Horchata and Jamaica water!!! That would put them in my all time favorite after Gallo failed!! :) Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"The street corn is dee-lish! Also the shrimp tacos are so good. The atmosphere is modern Dia DE Los Muertos and urban trendy. I'll be back \"with\" guests next time. This place should be shared!"}
{"text":"Looking for a food truck with some crazy good breakfast this is the place. The owner puts a lot of love into what he serving and as an added bonus he shares a little about his story. I the Tres Leche French toast and my wife had the Chilaquiles. It didn't hurt that weather was perfect either. Go and support the local spots like Paz."}
{"text":"PAZ Cantina has been one of my favorite downtown go-tos for some time now. Used to eat here every day when I worked within walking distance of it. Appears to be expanding a bit, too, which is cool - it's a large space and deserves to be filled all week long.  I *really* want to give PAZ five stars except that service has been consistently slow. That said, \"slow\" does not imply \"bad\". In fact, the servers here have always been truly wonderful and I look forward to interacting with them every time.  *Major upside to PAZ is their menu. SUCH good food at really affordable prices. My best friend always enjoys 1 or 3 of their $3 margaritas. The beer menu leaves a bit to be desired, but I never care too much so long as I'm stuffing my face with free chips and salsa.  Tinga Torta is the all-star of their menu, in my personal opinion. I have to CONVINCE myself to try new things when I go. The breakfast burritos are also delicious. And huge! You definitely get your money's worth here. Just be prepared to hunker down for a while, that's all.  Music is always just a little too loud for my taste, but that's part of the theme. Interior artwork is cool, outside patio is comfortable (even during hotter months), and they have games! Cornhole, ping-pong, etc. Really just a fun place to grab some food and relax.  I don't live or work anywhere near PAZ, but I still find excuses to come visit. I suggest you do the same, especially if you've never been. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but the service was horrible. Took forever for everything. Nice atmosphere (a little loud) but I will try it again. The quesadillas were awesome and the guacamole as well!!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a co worker. I went on Taco Tuesday. $2 margaritas and $1 off the tacos. The chips and salsa were okay. I ordered the pork belly and Carne asada tacos. They were both great! The slaw that came on the pork taco added a great taste to the taco. The meat in the Carne taco was cooked perfectly. The service was wonderful. I will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"I visited PAZ last night for a little Taco Tuesday.  The tacos were very good!  I ventured out and tried a cactus taco which is something I've never had before, great for vegetarians!  The hand squeezed house margaritas are a fantastic deal....and a little stronger than they taste.  The layout of the restaurant is great and I liked effort to display and support local artists.    I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! By far the worst experience we've had at a restaurant in a while! It all started when we had to wait almost 5 minutes before we were actually even greeted at the front. It was interesting because I said to my date a couple of times, \"I think we should just go!\" -- Well, you know what they say about intuition. I should've stuck with mine. Even then, I had a very open mind as I was craving some good Mexican food.  We were seated at a table close to the bar & ordered the Margarita & Basil Drop drinks. The Margarita came out in a decent amount of time but the Basil Drop took quite a while. The menu said there were to be muddled blueberries in it; there were none to be seen. I probably would've sent that back but my date was enjoying it so we continued sipping away.  After a few glances over the menu, I decided to get the Tinga Taco & the Shrimp Taco and my date went with the Veggie Burrito & the Crispy Pork Belly taco. Out of the Tinga Taco & Shrimp Taco, I definitely preferred the Tinga. The chicken was really delicious and went well with the cabbage and creama; the shrimp taco on the other hand was a little disappointing as it lacked flavor & the shrimp were too dense. I've never had Crispy Pork Belly before but it was ridiculously fatty so when I took a bite all I could taste was fat, highly unappetizing. The Veggie Burrito was really big & filling but left much to be desired.  I do have to make note that the service was awful! We checked in & got a free order of the queso and we didn't get it for at least half an hour later. It had such a weird texture, we didn't even it it, such a shame too because it took over an hour and a half to get our food. We were so disappointed & quite frankly, I was still hungry but we figured we'd go somewhere else for dessert! I'm giving the 1-star because I have to and 1 additional star for the Tinga Taco."}
{"text":"Food is good but the staff needs more training. My waiter seemed to be recovering from last night's partying and it was relevant. Super slow, like maybe she was high. I don't mind weed smokers most times, but when they do it at work, it creates problems. My food disappeared while I was hitting the restroom, friends at my table didn't notice cause they were drunk, haha. But when asking the waitstaff, no one claimed the mistake or offered any solution or remedy. Can't say I'll be back after this experience. Sorry :/"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Each of us got 4 rounds of their $3 margaritas and they were amazing! The DJ, music, television, and free ping pong tables were also awesome additions. Cant wait to come again."}
{"text":"1st the cheese in my Pinche Burrito was cold and not melted. 2nd, how do you forget the rice and pico de gallo. 3rd, the price for the burrito is $6 and you add $3 to get some protein. $9 for a lousy burrito.   Taste- bleh   No me gusta. Best burrito in town? I don't think so"}
{"text":"Well the owner just won me over. My wife and I had an incident there a few months ago with a unruly bartender who gave me a hard time because I \"asked for a drink\".  So She posted a one star rating and so did I.  MICHAEL just emailed me and let me know that the situation was handled, and he (bartender dude) did not represent the spirit of the business.  So business owners,  Even if your food rocks, your abeyance is perfect and you serve your food on platinum forks, without good people your place is worth ****.  With that said, I'll be back at PAZ very soon. Great tacos, Tasty affordable Margaritas!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  The restaurant has cool paintings and the patio is large and comfortable!  The food and drinks were delicious and inexpensive. I had a carne asada taco and a chicken taco and they were fantastic. The atmosphere was very relaxing and the service was very friendly. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love the vibe of this place... It's great for just drinks or for dinner... I've only had the tacos but they are . Do yourself a favor & order the Pork Belly Taco... Food & drinks are priced very reasonably and great value for the quality."}
{"text":"Stopped by late-night and was pleasantly surprised. Friendly, helpful, efficient service. Food was very good -- guac tasted fresh and good; the chicken Tinga taco was DEE-lish. My dinner companions also gave two thumbs up."}
{"text":"We stopped in late night on a Wednesday. Staff was great - very friendly. Great margaritas. Tacos were above average and salsa and queso were both very good. Service was great.  The fifth star is because they have bean bags and a whole bunch of ping pong. Plenty of equipment and stuff is in good shape. I look forward to a rematch with JB from Chicago. Oh, and they allow dogs in the outdoor Area. You rock Paz!"}
{"text":"The TORTA and the Hare This is a story about Paz Cantina's torta, which is unTORTAbelievable. Just like the story, slow and steady wins the race. This night started off like any other. I was craving Mexican food because, well, reasons, and I wanted to try out the new place on Roosevelt Row. Off I went. As soon as I got there, I was sat and given some delish chips and salsa. Ordered a drink, but it took a bit to get it. It's ok, I've got chips and salsa, I'm very content. I placed my order for the carnita torta and prepared myself mentally. I'm not a torta expert and, I'll be honest, pretty new to Mexican food because I just moved here from Maine. There was a little delay in relaying my food, but I waited patiently. When it came, I was happy and anxious and maybe low on blood sugar. It was time. I took my first bite and fell in love. This was it, my dreams had come true. Seriously the best thing I had since I moved here. Anyways, that concludes my short story that I am writing while sitting in the restaurant. TL;DR Paz Cantina = GOOD"}
{"text":"Hipster taco shop on Roosevelt.  Huge spot with some cool art work and good music.  We ordered guac and an assortment of tacos.  My son had a chicken quesadilla.  The guac was good.  Pretty good size and tasted fresh.  The pork belly taco was really good.  Huge chunk of tasty pork fat with crispy ends.  The carne asada taco was on point.  The carnitas taco was also really good.  Fresh and savory.  Each taco was about 4-5 bites which made the 3-4 dollar price easier to swallow.  My sons quesadilla was large and awesome.  Good cheese, lots of chicken, with a side of crema and pico de gallo.    Our waiter was on top of it.  Our drinks and chips stayed full the entire time.  I would definitely come back and recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Literally the worst service I've experienced in Phoenix. Never seen so many servers and managers running around (or lack there of) and not know what they're doing. I Can find better service and better food at taco bell...and I don't even consider taco bell to be food."}
{"text":"I live in Mexico City so I know good Mexican food.  This place is legit.  The pork belly tacos were amazing,  and 3 dollar Margaritas were served strong, but were still pretty tasty.  My favorite was the Mexican street corn though.  If you aren't a meat eater, do yourself a favor and order you some corn!!!  I definitely got my taco fix while visiting Phoenix, and next time i'm in town will go back for sure!  One last thing: the vibe was pretty chill on the outdoor patio and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best places I've tried guac in the downtown area.  I already like the vibe after the hostel take over from the previous tenets. I am sure they didn't even change the alcohol from the shelves after The Local left.  One of my favorite places downtown is now this place. I hope for a long and healthy stay for Paz.  NOte: Don't get rid of Connie Hottie. ;)"}
{"text":"The food and drinks were good and the space is awesome. We had carne Asada tacos (good but expensive for what you get), nachos (delicious!), flautas, flan (I liked but my friends said it tasted too much like coffee), and churros. The restaurant is very open, great local art and spacious. There was also a good band there.  Unfortunately the service put a damper on our visit. The hostess and servers were rude and abrasive. The hostess slammed our menus down, rolled her eyes at us, and said she couldn't seat us without consulting with her manager. I asked the hostess for her name so I could speak with the manager--she yelled her name at me (Sydney) and a server came by to give me a death glare and a sarcastic comment to stick up for his friend. After I walked away I saw them gesturing towards me and obviously gossiping about me. It was very uncomfortable, very unprofessional, incredibly rude. Other servers rolled their eyes at us and took a long time to get us items we needed. I seriously felt like I was inconveniencing them each time I asked for something.   The manager came by and was apologetic, gracious, and polite. He offered us dessert and took some items off our tab. I was impressed with his approach however his staff needs to get it together. I don't think I'll be back unless someone else really wants to go. There are too many good places with nice service!"}
{"text":"A fun experience and delicious food. Our waitress, Monica was  great, even though she was very busy. You can sit inside or out on the patio. I thought it to be noisy inside with music a bit too loud. I don't like watching sports onTV screens either, so it was much better out on the patio. There is plenty of art work to admire. You can bring your dog on the patio as long as you pick up after it. I had the carne asada torta, it was amazing! So many tastes and the bread was perfect. A good size portion, so I only ate half. The pork taquitos had a very good flavor to it, I thought $4 was expensive for one. They are very small.  The chips and salsa are fabulous. You can taste the roasted chiles with such a flavor.   This is a must try!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and fresh. I tried beans and cheese, torta with pork belly and chips with guac.  I will stop by here again. Amazing food. This was some of the best food I have had in a while."}
{"text":"My girl was dancing in her seat while savoring the depth of the pork belly taco. I leaned back enjoying the carne asada taco that was infused with flavors rather than the flavors coming from a sauce on top. This place takes Mexican favorites to an upper eschelon.  It was a pleasure speaking with the chef and hearing his passion and heart in the menu."}
{"text":"Mmmmm, the tacos are so good. The pork belly taco will make you forget about the other white meat. My wife is in love with the calamari taco. After watching the movie Chef I had a need for a cuban sandwich and the Che Torta took care of that.  Servers are friendly and attentive. The owner was present both times we were there. On our first visit, a Saturday, he dropped by the table to make sure everything was great. We chatted about the music playing and the band that was to play later that night, which I believe was to be a jazzy reggae band. The second visit was a weeknight and he greeted and seated us.  The indoor/outdoor seating was nice this time of year."}
{"text":"The Hotdog de Sonora Torta was delicious!  I definitely appreciate how they thoughtfully combine the traditional with the modern.   My server was the sweetest little bohemian angel.   The place has good vibes,  good parking and it is very reasonably priced especially considering it is good quality food that tastes like it came from my nanas kitchen!  I am definitely coming back to try the nopales and Cafe flan."}
{"text":"This building is known for its poor luck with businesses staying open, but it's looking like Paz will stand a chance.  I was lured over by the $3 margarita and looking to wind down after seeing a movie at Film Bar. The margarita was excellent! Definitely worth the $3 and then some. My husband and I split the nachos and were unable to make much of a dent in them though not for lack of trying. I recommend sharing among 3 or 4 people. The place was PACKED so service was on the slower side. Still, our wonderful waiter was sure to stop by and update us on wait times for our food and drinks.  On the night we went there was a great DJ and a small dance floor. While we weren't able to hold much of a conversation with the noise level that high, watching the couples dance was a lot of fun."}
{"text":"The food was great! The service was okay, but you could get two tacos for the amount of filling that they put into one. Nice place! Decently priced."}
{"text":"Must have margaritas & street corn!!  P. S. This is an updated review since the parking lot has been updated and we beat our $290 parking ticket from several months ago. Thanks Paz!!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in downtown PHX!!! Brunch items are delicious as well. Chips & salsa are bangin, we gave been there 3 time & I've gotten 3 different meals all of them delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I can't think of a single negative thing about this place.  The food, the drinks, the service, the ambiance - all perfect in the coolest way.  We started with a frozen mango margarita with a spicy syrup on top.  It was a beautiful color,  and the sweet mango mingled beautifully with the heat of the syrup.  The chips were served warm and came with a fresh salsa.  The guacamole was piled high in the bowl and was chunky and fresh with a generous amount of cilantro.  I had a veggie burrito, which had a variety of roasted vegetables and spanish rice.  I loved that I could taste a slight char on the vegetables.  My lunch companion had a trio of tacos, which included barbacoa and a shrimp taco that had marinated onions on top.  I'm not sure what the third taco was because I was too busy falling in love with my burrito.  Our servers were friendly and one of them showed us the colorful local artwork that adorned the walls, as well as the art studio where local artists bring their artwork, play ping pong, and hang out in this unique and delicious Phoenix cantina.  Paz Cantina was recommended to us by a bellman at the Sheridan in downtown Phoenix.  We asked if he could suggest a place for Mexican food that wasn't touristy.  Mission accomplished.  Whether you live in Phoenix, or just passing through, check Paz out.  Really.  Do it."}
{"text":"I'm friends with the chefs so I have to say my opinion is biased.  That being said it warms my Nopalista heart to see the many people I don't know, in the short time this restaurant has been open, saying such great things about the nopales (cactus) taco!  They're doing our local veggie (plus a lot of other things) proud!  I just KNEW this venue would flourish with the right business! Kudos!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in town, literally. Great vibrations. Awesome artwork. Friendly service. Great tacos. Delicious tacos, did I mention this already? Hip music! And a huge plus is the galleries they have for large groups, or two bars for a place to hangout. Overall, it's the place to be!!"}
{"text":"Great patio and vibe at Paz. I got the pork belly, fish and carne asada tacos and they were all pretty good. But the Guac we got for the table was way too salty."}
{"text":"Stopped on way back from art museum great Patio and excellent service sampled four Tacos and the pork belly and fish were awesome not as excited about the Carne Asada good just not great. Kudos to our waitress very attentive but not pushy.all in all excellent spot to sit relax and have good food and drink."}
{"text":"The tinga chicken torta left little to be desired. No flavor and barely any chicken on the torta. Bummer. However, the queso was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I had the tinga torta and carne asada- sooooo good.   This place is absolutely fantastic. Seriously, a must. I had 2 days in Phoenix (traveling) and gave this place a shot - and I'm so glad I did. Everyone here is wonderful and the food was just perfect. Wouldn't change a thing :)"}
{"text":"It looks very cool awesome art on the walls and the staff was super nice greeted me very friendly and the bartender called me by named which I love I asked for a bloody marry and it was made to perfection  there guacamole was fresh and delicious . Going to start coming and maybe even be a regular here."}
{"text":"Ever since I moved downtown, this little corner of 3rd Street and Roosevelt has seemingly been one of those spots where good restaurants go to die.  I'm not sure if its the building, the fact that its set back from the street or the restaurant concepts themselves.  For whatever reason, nothing ever sticks here.  I remember when this location was the popular breakfast and brunch chain known as Scratch.  I remember when this place was The Local, a bold upscale concept that invited curiosity but never caught fire.  Now Paz, a cantina style taqueria has taken hold here.  Will it stick? Difficult to say.  But first impressions are good enough that I hope so.  The menu at Paz is one that largely sticks to a core of Mexican food favorites.  There are a few choices of tacos and tortas and a few other items, but the menu doesn't venture very far from that.  If you're looking for a wider variety, there are plenty of other Mexican establishments to choose from.  But despite the limited choices, the choices I had at my disposal tonight were quite tasty.  Tonight I went for four different tacos.  A pair of traditional tastes in the Carne Asada and Carnitas.  And for a little outside the box variety I went with the Tinga (a slow cooked chipotle chicken taco) and a Fish taco with I believe was fried mahi mahi.  My friend also got two tacos (the Tinga and Carne Asada).  When they came out, the presentation was tremendous with an array of colors from the different meats and toppings incorporated into the tacos.  All were small street style tacos with a soft warm tortilla to match.  By far my favorite was the Carne Asada.  I guess I'm traditional, but its just hard to beat great grilled steak.  The Tinga was also excellent and I especially loved the pickled onions they used to top it.  The Carnitas was also as expected with crispy pork and a chile sauce that had just the right amount of kick.  The fish taco was actually a bit spicier than most fish tacos I've had.  That jalapeño sauce probably had a lot to do with it.  Overall, a delicious taco assortment and just the right size.  I also got one of their \"One Love\" Margaritas with 100% pure agave tequila, strawberries, and Grand Marnier.  Tasty drink, though for $8 I probably would've expected a bigger size.  Which brings me to my one beef with the place.  The prices.  Total price for me and my friend for 6 individual tacos, a margarita, tax and tip came to about $35.  Chips and salsa were included too, but you catch the drift.  Its probably a little expensive for what it is.  The quality was excellent, but I'm not sure it was $35 excellent.    Still, there's enough to like about this place that I'd certainly make another trip.  And to the credit of the owners, they've hit on a niche in that Roosevelt Row (until now) had virtually no Mexican food offerings to speak of.  Seems like they're still tinkering with the menu and the design of the restaurant, but so far they seem to be garnering a stronger following than this location's predecessors.  We'll see if it has staying power.  Hooray for tacos!"}
{"text":"Last night was my FIRST First Friday experience in Downtown Phoenix! After growing up in Arizona and being a self proclaimed Taco Eating Expert, naturally I couldn't resist The Paz Taqueria Food Truck! My nose lead my heart and stomach straight up! I tend to eat vegetarian and the Hippie Taco, which is fried brussel sprouts, kale, and pickled red onions was UH-MAY-ZIIING!!! The homemade salsa packs heat, which this native girl LOVES! Street corn was grilled to perfection and smothered in spices, mayo, and cotija! They had quite a line and our food (4 tacos, chips and salsa, and corn) was out in less than 7 minutes! They even came and checked on us after we'd been served to make sure we liked it! Find this truck and eat all their foods!"}
{"text":"This place just opened up and we wanted to give it a try.  Everything from the service, the apps, drinks, and the food was awesome.  Everything was fresh the tacos were amazing.  Really authentic street tacos. Try the pork belly!!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! We were driving to another Yelp find and saw the food truck.   We immediately flipped a 'b$tch' and parked.  The menu was short and sweet, just the way they should be.  I don't get when food establishments have a million items on their menus, how can you possibly prepare those perfectly every time?  It's not happening!! Every taco we ordered was made to perfection!    I'm on the move so I'll finish this review up in a bit..my pics tell the story of what my mouth and belly so lovingly devoured!"}
{"text":"I hate to say it but it is one of the worst places I have been in a long time. It started by having to park in the Mud and then walk around the building to the entrance. The only reason we decided to go there is the false advertising for Sushi Bar. They claimed they just never changed the sign. Will all the business one would have to think they left there on purpose to trick people. We would have left had we not been going to the Opera and didnt have time to select another location. Poor service and small overpriced food. I have tasted better at a back yard get together. I do not recommend!!! People started walkingbout as they were not getting service. Bad start to our night!"}
{"text":"Great new addition to Roosevelt Row!  We stopped in last night on our way home from the airport and had a great experience.  Nice space, friendly staff and super tasty food.  We tried the rock shrimp, carnitas, tinga and carne asada tacos with rice and beans - flavorful, fresh and just plain tasty!  Good neighborhood place to enjoy some good food on the patio or in the bar while watching the game!"}
{"text":"Terrible food and drinks. Cool restaurant layout. Service staff and managers were attentive.   It was packed for First Friday, which was opening night. Bad decision. The manager who stopped by admitted he had not yet tasted the food or drinks. One more indicator of why everything was so poorly executed.  The craft beer selection is unfamiliar but mediocre. The mixed drinks were all made in batches, according to staff, and tasted watered down. All were terrible.                                                           The appetizer menu has 3 chips & dip options including salsa, guacamole and queso. The chips were chewy, as if they were either not cooked enough or they were stale. The salsa, queso and guacamole were all lacking in flavor. The queso looked and tasted like potato soup.  They have 5 tacos on the menu. The carne asada and carnitas were very dry and flavorless. Temperature was between luke warm and cold. The cactus was unique, had a mild grilled flavor but was only so-so. The calamari tasted overly breaded and overly fried. The chicken was flavorless, as if frozen chicken had been reheated and some sauce had been thrown over it at the last minute.  Service staff and managers seemed to care, visited us on many occasions and ultimately comped our meal. They asked us to come back and we will. I will gladly update this review if food quality improves. I hope it does."}
{"text":"Really nice place with a cool vibe. The outdoor seating was great for warm Spring day in the Valley. They provide a lot of space for cyclists. I ordered the guacamole and the \"Tinga Torta\" along with the strawberry lemonade. The pulled marinated chicken on my torta was very flavorful. The guacamole was very fresh...made to order. Their complimentary chips and salsa was also very good. Next time, I'll pass on their lemonade...it didn't have much strawberry flavor and wasn't sweet. My waitress quickly gave me a Sprite instead."}
{"text":"Ordered a Black India Pale.  Bartender said, \"That will be $9.50.\"    I have been drinking craft beer for twenty years.  This is the highest price I have ever been confronted with. The mumble from the bartender that it was, \"....eight or nine percent alcohol,\" is incredible.    I dared not order a taco.  No telling what the cost of three bites of tortilla and a dab of beef might have run."}
{"text":"$3 Paz margarita is delicious. Chips and salsa - great too!! Chill atmosphere. First Friday there is extremely fun!"}
{"text":"I read about this restaurant in the Scottsdale magazine and just had to come and try it out.  After convincing my family that this would be well worth the long detour, I was not disappointed.  So as to avoid having to make any decisions, we ordered one of every taco.  I still could not tell you which one was the best.  They were all equally mouth watering and tantalizing.  I also quite enjoyed the laid-back atmosphere which allowed for my 18 month old to pitch his little fits with no one noticing.  However, this is also why I gave it only four stars (the food was 5 out of 5). There was a DJ playing when we arrived at 6 and the music was REALLY loud. Sitting at a small table, we were unable to hold a conversation.  This meant we ate fast in order to leave.  I would 100% go back, but would take the food to go and sit on the hood of my car out in the parking lot!"}
{"text":"If I could give more than 5 stars I would! Great amazing atmosphere.... But even better was the amazing handmade cocktails (Jalepeno Popper Margarita is to die for!) and the DELICIOUS food. We started with the made to order Guacamole and Chicken Nachos which were by far the best I've ever had, no joke! Next I had Pork Belly Tacos and I was in heaven. This is a place I'll be sure to try again. I'm excited to check out their weekend brunch sometime!"}
{"text":"We came in here at 10:55pm,  First of all, don't look at customers all confused when they walk in. The restaurant was empty, and they were starting to close but yelp says they close at 12? So I asked, and yes it was 12. We felt a little awkward , but decided to stay. Bad idea....  We ordered tacos and we can see the cook from the seat we were in, and he looked kinda pissed off when the order went through. Actually he looked REALLY pissed off. Next time, stand AWAY from the dining room so we can't see you nodding your head and bitching as you read the ticket.. The blonde waitress is kind of rude & has a bad attitude. Honestly the food wasn't even worth it. Bland and tasteless....  Never going back."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with $3 margaritas, amazing tacos and a great atmosphere. Oh and if your into football...great place to watch a game!"}
{"text":"The music they played on the speakers was to loud to hold a conversation over - then they turn it off for live music that was impossible to speak over.  Good place to go if you are with people you don't want to talk to."}
{"text":"Decor and atmosphere was pretty cool. Love the concept. We tried few items: nachos (good, would repeat); streets tacos (unimpressed); kale Salad (great potential, except for the dressing). We went on a week day around 5. Not too busy, about 1/2 full. Waitress was friendly and polite. Gentlemen who brought out the food, surly, and unhelpful. The music way too loud, made it so hard to talk. Overall wanted to like the place,  Would like to try again when the weather is cooler and we can sit outside, perhaps it would be more enjoyable. By the time we left we had headache from trying to communicate over the loud music.  Will give another try. But definitely not a \"relaxing\" environment."}
{"text":"The food is good, some of the drinks are a little \"non-authentic\" but all of that is fine. The real problem was he ONE waitress they had for the entire place. It's a Friday night, the place is 80-85% full and although she's doing her best to cover it all, one more server would really come in handy to avoid the long wait times."}
{"text":"The chips + salsa and veggie torta are AMAZING. It's always hoppin and is a pretty chill place to hang. F*** yeah PAZ!"}
{"text":"I would love to base this rating their food....but alas we never got served. Stood there for 5 min and never got served."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to having dinner here. The wait was pretty short for a Friday. The food is good, not great. But the noise is unbelievable. My friend and I could not hear each other and cut our meal short because of the noise. The floors, walls and ceiling are hard surfaces and the voices just overwhelmed us. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place sux. The waitstaff is extremely inattentive and it took them 30 minutes to even notice us. And let me say the food is AWFUL. Old beans straight out of a can and tastless salsa. The tortillas were soggy. Blahhh"}
{"text":"One must try the pork belly tacos. They are better than words can describe. Happy hour until 7:00 pm daily. The nachos are also delicious. Try this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"If you want to experience PHOENIX then PAZ is the perfect place to celebrate the things that make this City unique and awesome: Fresh delicious food & tasty cocktails ($3 Marg). Vibrant murals and art adorn the inside and out, bringing the whole corner to life. Live music, dancing & ping pong. A super family friendly venue, you can feel the love that the owners have for food and this city through the presentation of their meals and the complete dining experience."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. If you're going to have a guy working the counter then they should know how to deal with mass service and whose order goes to who. Our food was given away to drunk patrons on the curb. While I really enjoy the Paz food this truck needs a serious \"redesign\" in who runs the truck and how they present customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some food and drink with friends tonight and Paz was awesome.. Stand outs were the Pork Belly Tacos (omg, yum) and a drink called 'Dangerous Liason.' Service was fantastic and everyone was SO friendly.. Patio is dog friendly, prices are really reasonable and it's going on our short list of spots to hang out at in downtown Phoenix.. Great evening, guys - Thanks so much!!!"}
{"text":"From the atmosphere to the food, everything always seems to be on point at Paz. I always opt for the tacos (duh). Their carne asada and taco del mar (calamari) are my go to. Special $3 margarita AND they have Mexican beers!! Victoria in cans! I'm sold. Always friendly waiters, too. Just wish they'd play more music that suits the atmosphere."}
{"text":"just stopped in for lunch. was able to get in and out and back to work in time. wasn't too busy. there were two servers working and helping each other out. both were super friendly. I ordered three tacos - fish, carnitas and pork belly. Here is my rating based on five stars: Fish - four stars. nice chunk of lightly breaded/fried ... the sweet/sour pink purple slaw thing on top really added to the flavor. Carnitas - 4 stars. really tasty. They use a crispy pork versus the usual pulled pork. I think I prefer the usual, but it was still good. The best for last - Pork Belly - five stars. I could have eaten 5 of them...perfectly crisp on outside, delicious evil fatty layer...drooling. Figured since I had an hour lunch, I could treat myself to a cocktail too. You cant beat a $3 house margarita! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Paz cantina is located in the Roosevelt área of Phoenix. This area is pretty hipster if you're into that. I enjoyed all of the street art in the area surrounding this taco truck. I decided to go with the Carne asada and carnitas since they're pretty impossible to mess up. The carne asada was pretty standard. But the carnitas? Delicious. Best I've ever had truck or not. And their salsa was to die for. Wash it all down with a mandarin Jarritos and you're good to go. Prices were great and the owner was very attentive and appreciative of my business. So often, owners want you in and out as quick as possible but he took the time to talk to me. That went a long way towards my impression of paz cantina."}
{"text":"Excellent!   Great service and food.  Played in the Monday Ping Pong tournament and had a great time.  Music was was just loud enough to enjoy but you could still have a good conversation without yelling.  Very fun night out!"}
{"text":"I'd give it negative stars if it was possible. We made reservations for 30 people and they set aside the bar area for 10 people for us and the owner/manager was very rude to us when we questioned how they expected 30 of us to sit there. They eventually got us seated and the service from the staff was amazing. Then they decided to add 17% to everyone's bill which is okay for a group. But two of us who had $6 drinks had bills for over $10. That's like 66% not 17%. We questioned the owner / manager and he was very rude. We said we would go on Yelp and he said, \"Do you want your ass beat?\" Like seriously?! He almost got his ass beat."}
{"text":"Good food and fun but slow service."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us so we checked it out.  The salsas are good (not spicy though).  After an entire one hour wait for 3 tacos and French toast, we were more than disappointed.  The frustrating part is the service is horrific.  If you like good prompt service don't even stop.  It took 20 minutes to get our drink order.  I had high expectations and want to support local but we won't be back.  Too bad Phoenix needs a good taco place!  We will eventually run into one.  They need to hire staff and get some servers to run the food and perhaps even more people in the kitchen.  The food was seriously a D- as there was no flavor at all except in the salsas.  Definitely if you don't want breakfast or lunch to turn into 3-4 hours PASS.  The steak taco was made of steak but it was chopped up like it looked like it belonged in a dog food can!"}
{"text":"I liked the environment, modern hipster like. The bartender was very nice, just not super attentive to detail, but that's not such an important thing to me. The food was okay, I had 3 different tacos just to try them, but it's hard for me to justify a $4+ taco. The fish taco had basically no fish, but the calimari was good and the pork belly was good. most disappointing part was the bathroom. The trash was over full, the toilet wouldn't flush and it was so dark I had to open the door to see myself in the mirror. But, still liked it okay enough to try it again."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos! I tried them all! The smashed jalapeño margaritas are my fave of all time! Thanks Michael for owning such an awesome place, being so down to earth and taking time to meet your customers. You rock!"}
{"text":"Best carnitas tacos & guacamole I've had in forever! My friend said her Michelada was out of this world good. It seemed they were training new wait staff, which is good. Overall, a great experience. Will definitely be back. Oh, stick around and linger over the artwork in the studios. All are local artists and very talented."}
{"text":"Don't you hate it when you can't eat street tacos and play cornhole and ping pong at the same place? Well that's not a problem anymore at Paz Cantina. This is the coolest place to get the most delicious street tacos and then play some games and look at fun art, all in one spot. There's a bar and indoor seating and outdoor seating, and the games are set up on the outside in the center of little plaza. All the tacos on the menu sounded really good, so it was hard to decide what to order. I ended up getting the fish taco and the nopales taco and the street corn. The tacos were really really yummy! The corn was also delicious! Our table also got the queso de paz and the guacamole and they were pretty tasty too. The food was excellent and the service was amazing. I really enjoyed the hip and casual ambiance of this place. The art that was hanging on the walls inside were really fun too. My favorite was the one of the red and yellow bell peppers with Dia de los Muertos faces.   After eating dinner, we decided to burn off some of the calories we consumed with a game of ping pong. The equipment (paddles and balls) were in a crate. There are two ping pong tables so there are ping pong balls flying everywhere! Paz Cantina is one of the best and funnest places I've ever eaten at. Too bad it's in a totally different state than where I live - if I'm ever back in Phoenix, I'll definitely come back for more tacos and perhaps a round or two of cornhole!"}
{"text":"I went there last night, and it was my first time going. The food was good, but the customer service needs improvement. Even after most people left, the waiter kept forgetting about my table. Don't recommend this place if you're in a hurry. I would go definitely go back for the food. I ordered the Carne Asada Tacos, Pork Belly Tacos, and the Tres Leches French Toast. Hopefully the service improves by the time I go back."}
{"text":"Sometimes you need to wash Christmas down with a margarita. Yesterday, I did just that. Both finding ourselves with the day off and nothing to do but mill around downtown, the hubs and I stopped in late afternoon for a little happy hour, which they have daily (sweet bonus!)   We sat at the bar because we're those kind of people and the TV behind the bar was playing National Lampoon's Vacation... The house marg was way tasty. They are served in a short glass, which is good because they go down eaaaaasy. We had chips and salsa and that salsa is spicy and perfect. Amazing. We weren't exceptionally hungry but ordered some flautas. If these little gems are any indication of the level of tastiness of all the items on the menu, I may move in. Literally, like bring a label maker over there and declare a bar stool mine.   We chatted with Kevin who was working behind the bar. Cool dude. Great 'stache. Here's where they made us want to be regulars: Kevin introduced himself and asked our names and then called us by our names to see if we needed another cocktail. I love that kind of service. He gave us some great info about the menu and happenings, too.  They have events and live music certain days and what looks to be a great brunch on the weekends. The outdoor patio looks nice (it was a bit chilly yesterday) and is dog friendly which is another bonus. You can bet we'll be back and bring a huge appetite!"}
{"text":"DO NOT order the fish tacos.  We waited 2.5 hours to sit down and get our food.   We sat down and ordered our drinks.  Waited another 20 minutes. Drinks never came.  I tracked down the waiter to order food.   We ordered our meal for 7 people.  The table of 15 next to us was fully fed and drinks served- even though they sat after us.   The food came out An HOUR and a HALF later.  Two orders were under cooked.   They comped %50 of the meal for the shit Service.  I will never come back.  DONT order the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Phoenix magazine listed this place to be best taco and cheap margarita. The margaritas are only $3.00 and are listed as fresh squeezed citrus, yet it comes out of a tap.  A little too sweet for my taste. As for the tacos, I ordered the chipotle chicken taco and grilled Napoles taco.  They were out of the Napoles, bummer.  The chicken taco is loaded with meat, but it is sweet.  It tastes like shredded BBQ chicken in a taco, just weird.    As for service we sat at the bar.  The gal who helped us was a little slow, but it is only her 3rd day so she is still learning. No biggie All in all, I guess this just isn't the place for me. My husband, however, had the pork belly taco and loved it minus the slaw.  It was too vinegary for him, but he really dislikes vinegar. I did really like the atmosphere and art work."}
{"text":"Great food & tasty $3 margarita!!!!!  Carne Asada torta FIVE stars Kale & Quinoa salad---good but if you are very hungry won't be filling enough without adding protein.  Guac is tasty & good portion size -has a basil/tomato twist but a bit over priced (ie it basically costs the same as an entree) Margarita was yummy, only $3, perfect strength (not weak or overdone) Great outdoor seating Like the music Friendly & attentive staff:)"}
{"text":"Great downtown location with plenty of outdoor seating and Live music. I started with chips And salsa and a Margarita. The Salsa was perfect blend of spice that tingled your tongue just right. The Margarita was decent.  For the main course I ordered three tacos. The fish, Pork and Carnitas. All were perfection. The service was friendly and fast. Walked out under 20 bucks."}
{"text":"Solid guacamole, crispy housemade chips and delicious tacos. One of the highlights during my recent trip to phoenix. Fair prices for solid food and the service was excellent. Surly and salty at times but I love good banter!"}
{"text":"Really fun place and cute waitresses (Sierra and Cindy). First Friday is a blast, other than that they have a great happy hour with cheap (and good too), tacos and $2.00 margaritas. Haven't tried the brunch yet but it looks fantastic. I hear parking is a problem but I live so close I can walk so I don't have to worry about it. If you haven't tried it you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Food is OK. Guacamole is delicious.  But service is horrendous. Slow, rude, lackadaisical. We asked for water refills so many times. When it finally came the server slammed the bottles on the table as if he was inconvenienced by having to serve us. Our group of 8 was the only other table in the restaurant around lunchtime when we sat down. We immediately ordered guacamole. 20 minutes later when the guacamole had still not arrived we politely inquired. \"It's being made by hand. It's not in a package somewhere. If you need something fast, this isn't the place to come!\" All we could think was, wow, 20 minutes isn't asking for an appetizer \"fast\" and considering its downtown location, you might not want to tell downtown professionals that you cant service them promptly.  Meals came out at a variety of times. First 3 people served together. Then 8 minutes later another 2 people. Then 2 more. Then the last person.   Almost ran out of water again.  Also when we arrived at 11:35am I told the server I would like to order soon because I needed to leave by 12:30-12:40. I did make it out in time, to their credit, but I don't think 60 minutes over lunch is \"speedy\" in a downtown environment when you are the second table in line for lunch.  Our group had visited this restaurant one time before, and decided then not to go back. We thought that because it had been a few months we would give it another try. It was WORSE this time.  Never going back."}
{"text":"No but seriously, I love this place.  $3 House Margaritas.  Queso Dip with chips.  These are really the only two things I need to be happy.   But if I'm feeling like cheese and tequila aren't enough for a full meal (wait, it isn't?) they also have amazing tacos, brunch, appetizers, beer, mixed drinks and whatever else their awesome chefs and bartenders come up with. The cool thing is they are constantly reinventing the menu and trying out new things.   Want live music on the weekend while sitting on a shaded patio? Yeah, they've got that.  Want cool a cool space to chill during First Friday? They've got that too.  Highly, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Paz now has their food truck directly across Roosevelt, just east of the Wurth house. 11 to 4, 5:30 to 4am.  They have a Socks for Taco plan. Bring a pack of new socks that will be given to the homeless & get a free taco."}
{"text":"Good local neighborhood vibe! Drinks are good , bartenders lil slow.  Long wait on weekends. Awesome live music!"}
{"text":"Paz was a pretty awesome taco eating experience.  The place has cool art everywhere, the staff was extremely friendly, and their taco's were super amazing.  And if you love flan, I highly highly recommend you try this places, it was out-of-this-world.    I also got a chance to meet the owner, who was really nice and down-to-earth.  I witnessed him helping a few customers out by serving them himself. Talk about having a heart of service.  Five stars, I totally recommend this place!  P.S, there are outside activities like ping pong and corn hole, which I thought added a cool, relaxed, fun-filled vibe, making a great place to hang out for a couple of hours."}
{"text":"Best street tacos and $3.00 margaritas in town!  All of our tacos and sides were fresh,  and delicious and washed town with a few margarita, made for a perfect evening with friends.  Prices are very reasonable for made to order , authentic food and drinks.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I would have to say this was the best meal I've eaten in at least the last year. The chips and salsa were above average. Negra Modelo on tap and the most incredible torta I've ever had. It was the Che Torta, just like a Cubano sandwich but made with a torta instead of a roll. The roasted pork was super tender and the ham grilled to perfection. I was in Phoenix on business, but I will most definately go there every time I go to Phoenix from now on. Just plain awesome."}
{"text":"No..all around NO.   I gave Paz Cantina a try the other night given the reviews here.   Food = mediocre/not traditional nor authentic Drinks = bad Service = decent  Street taco's and guacamole were abysmal and the michelada's were horrid.  I won't be back"}
{"text":"Love the tacos here.  Good service.  Also loved the live music.  One issue I have is the temperature of the place.  I've been here twice and it felt a little bit too warm inside both times.  Other than that, love the place."}
{"text":"Came here before an photo show opening...  Love the location and vibe of the place.  Got the Chicken flautas.  Very good and fresh!  The service was a slow.  Had to ask for refills and took forever to get our bill.  Loved that they have live music!"}
{"text":"Tasty margaritas, OK food, average service.   I have been to Paz a couple times now, a quick walk from where I live.   The first time, we just had some margaritas late on a Thursday night.  The margaritas are only $3.00 and rather delicious.  That's a definite positive!   The service that evening was just OK. They got us the order in a decent amount of time, and payment was easy.   Of course, First Fridays are going to be busy. The hostess wasn't exactly friendly but did take our names, and we got in fairly quickly for a busy evening.  The server was slow and unhelpful.     Food: The food is pretty good, though I should not have ordered the torta.  The chips and salsa are yummy and fresh.  The tacos are usually pretty good.  Again, I love the $3 margaritas.   Our server was slow and just didn't seem interested in us at all - very apathetic.   EDIT on restrooms: Per management, there is more than one restroom.  The one restroom is near the bar, but there are others.  The service can be slow too. The ambiance is fun - interesting artwork, a happening place!"}
{"text":"I've come here twice and each time the service has been terrible. Our waitress even forgot she never brought our food. But the food was really good! But the service definitely isn't worth it."}
{"text":"I found this to be a very lack luster spot and rather noisy. Personally, I like to relax when I eat. The parking in the rear is on a dirt lot. There are so many choices in the Valley for Mexican food, I doubt that i will return."}
{"text":"looking for a cool and casual spot to relax with friends, grab a taco or five, and drink yummy and affordable margaritas? PAZ is where it's at on roosevelt row.   great laid back vibe, so don't be in a rush... but when you're talking $3 house margaritas, who's in a hurry?  make sure to try the delicious carne asada tacos, ya know, if you're into good eats and such."}
{"text":"The brunch is great. We always come here when we are in town. My favorite is the queso and the pork belly. Soooo good, the cocktails are amazing as well."}
{"text":"I almost want to lower my rating because of the neighborhood it's in, but they totally earn the five stars. The food is fresh and good, reasonably priced. The environment is friendly social with games for the kids and adults. Big screen TVs inside that can be watched from outside under the heaters (if needed at night). Loved our visit and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Pork belly tacos were worth every penny. The service could be more organized and friendlier especially because it's not jam packed in here."}
{"text":"They serve brunch until 3 pm which is an hour later than most brunch places, nice for us late risers. I had a delicious veggie burrito with nopales and lots of other yummy veggies. This item was on the torta list but it can be made into a burrito instead. Our water glasses were always full which is a must for me.   We had a fruit plate that was piled with watermelon, honey dew, strawberries, black berries and jicama. It was elevated though as they were all covered in quinoa. Yum.   There was a multi piece jazz band playing while we ate on the patio and it was very enjoyable.   The only reason they get a 4 is because their guacamole was inedibly salty."}
{"text":"I've been to Paz three times, and all three times have been exceptional. Great service and good food. I've only had a couple of tacos, the fish taco, carnitas, and carne asada. The fish taco was moist and it had this tartar type of sauce drizzled on top which was delicious! The carnitas, which I was a little apprehensive about getting was juicy and had a slight layer of fat which gave it some extra flavor. The carne asada was flavorful and delicious. Out of all the tacos the fish taco was my favorite! Love the decor of the place, the day of the dead paintings look like they are Lalo Cota's work which is a local artist! Over all I give it four big stars! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down, AMAZING. My mom has been loving this place, so of course she took me to try it. I love everything about this place. All the art work on the walls is by a local artist, they use local products and the owner is an awesome guy! Definitely good vibes all around.   My mom and I both ordered the veggie torta, everything was seasoned perfectly and the bread, oh man, the bread!! I also order the house margarita, which was awesome as well. We weren't going to get dessert until I read what the options were... Well, ended up getting the bunuelos (they are tossed in cinnamon sugar, drizzled with local honey, topped with spiced walnuts and black berries, all which is laying on a bed of cinnamon cream goodness). I seriously cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"The service was great!  Everyone was really friendly and kind.  We went for lunch (around 1:00 on a Thursday); so, it wasn't very busy, but there were a few other tables full of people in there.  We checked in on Yelp, which meant we received a free order of queso.  OH MY GOSH... you must get the queso!  It was unreal.  Their chips are fantastic as well.  Between the two of us, we got the queso, a cheese quesadilla, and two street tacos (they are tiny, fyi).  I had the fish taco which was awesome, and my friend had the shredded chicken (tinga), which she said was great.  I highly recommend PAZ!  I actually want to check out their brunch because I've heard such stellar things about it. :)  Oh, and get the margs... They are only $3 at all times!! Super smooth and tasty."}
{"text":"My favorite menu item is most definitely the street corn! It's a must. To be fair, I have yet to try any breakfast options but have been to the truck several times. We ordered a pork belly & chorizo burrito - which was very heavy on the beans (too much so) and the meat was a little too chewy for my liking. The staff had a lot of recommendations and was very friendly. We had also ordered a tinga taco and salmon taco. Both were good! All in all, the food was decent but I feel like their breakfast would excel. I'll go back for the street corn any day"}
{"text":"Alright so after hearing so many good things about this place I checked it out! It was nice, really great actually, the customer service was amazing & every staff member we encountered was friendly & cheerful. Apart from their service, the food came by quicker than I imagined so that's a plus! I had the Sonoran dog and this thing was amazing, I usually have to order a second plate but this was well worth the money and it filled me up. I ordered Horchata and maybe I'm just being delicate but it did taste kind of weird, but nothing too bad I still drank it all. I plan to go back to try several other things in their menu! Overall I recommend this place, worth the bang for your buck, and the environment is overall just friendly & great."}
{"text":"Such a cool concept, great atmosphere and the food is AMAZING.  You can't beat fresh food sourced from local vendors cooked and served by a really cool, eclectic staff.  It really is as good as it gets.  I highly recommend the Che and the Ham & Egg Torta (brunch menu).  Although, all of the tacos we tried were awesome as well.  One of their signs says it all, \"peace, love, and taco grease.\""}
{"text":"Sweet god of obesity. If I lived within walking distance to Paz Cantina, they'd have to roll me out the door on a nightly basis.   Where do I even begin? The food is incredible. The carne asada nachos are the absolute best you'll find anywhere in Phoenix. Guaranteed.  It's topped with refried beans, crema, and some of the best guac around. The carne asada is always juicy and flavorful and available in street taco and burrito portions. The pork belly taco is a crispy, juicy religious experience. The nopales taco is also a delicious vegetarian option, and the fish taco is sublime with pickled veggies, a teeny sliver of jalapeno, and crispy, juicy fish. The dangerous liason drink will get you lit and feeling fantastic. Even the free chips and salsa are exceptional.   The ambiance is trendy, the staff friendly, but the food is what will keep you coming back for more. I usually go on Sunday nights and they have a DJ out front and the music is loud. I find the atmosphere enjoyable, but if you're not into loud music visiting Paz on the other nights of the week is quieter and enjoyable as well."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm writing an obituary, as they have temporarily closed their brick and mortar restaurant due to impending development on that plot of land.   I think my favorite thing I ever ate at Paz was the pork belly tacos. It was just the right portion of pork belly, and could also be paired with the chicken tinga or nopales tacos. I tried the pork belly torta, and it just didn't have the spice or flavor I was hoping for, but the tacos were scrumptious.   The house margarita was also amazing--inexpensive, but they didn't skimp on the quality. I'm looking forward to going to the new space someday and enjoying tacos and a margarita.  And in light of this obit, I'm so excited that they've opened a food truck in the interim, before their new brick and mortar space is open and ready in the far future. I guess this food truck proves there really is life after death."}
{"text":"We dropped in this Saturday to watch the ASU game, and considering it had just opened (several weeks earlier than official opening from what I understand), I was really impressed with the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff.  The cantina choices for cocktails and beers were thoughtful and adventurous, and as we heard will be expanding shortly.  Two big screen TVs to watch the game in a causal setting, in the perfect area of town, were just what we had hoped for.  We will definitely be back for the full menu and will be frequent visitors to the cantina.  A very nice addition to the downtown scene."}
{"text":"Oh my! Being Hispanic, I hold these types of restaurants to a higher standard and this restaurant surpassed all other taco venders in the valley! From the perfectly spiced salsa and homemade chips to the fish and tasty carne asada tacos, it was simply amazing! We also tried the corn which we asked to be taken off of the husk and served as a side, was mouth watering at the very least. This has to be my new favorite restaurant. Simple menu but packed with fabulous choices. Great job Michael!"}
{"text":"I ended up ordering the hippie tacos and then went back after eating them for two more. Mike, the owner, is very friendly and the food comes out in good timing. The tacos that I had were delicious. They had great flavor and the chips had a good crunch. The beans were great as well. I would definitely eat there again if the truck comes by the offices again."}
{"text":"Four of us just  finished eating. A few things here include \"love\" as an ingredient.  I'm pretty sure the rest are made with a healthy dose of dispair. I asked each one of my compatriots how they would describe the meal on one word:  disgusting, dirty, bland,  and sad. We ordered margaritas; I think they forgot the tequila.  We also got the carnitas, fish, pork belly, carne asada tacos and chips and guac.  The tacos were miserable. The fish, pork belly, and carnitas tacos were super bland; which  itself is somewhat impressive. The worst of the lot was the carne asada which had the texture of chewed gum and the flavor of silly putty rolled in the ashtray of an chain-smoker. The guac was good though : nice and fresh."}
{"text":"One of the coolest and best kept secrets in Phoenix! The place is hip and funky, the food is outstanding (super high quality) and the service is always fast, friendly and fun. I am a HUGE FAN of this place."}
{"text":"It's ok far from great. I got two varieties of the tacos. $3.25 plus each. Should be no more than $2 each. They were nothing to write  home about. The salsa has a funky taste to it. I think they put sugar in it. The margaritas are cheap and weak. I would eat here again if passing by but it's not a place I would suggest  to go to. The service needs a lot of work had to flag down the server for everything including salt."}
{"text":"Hip & Fun. Michael and Baugy are the new owners. Open just 9 days. Small street taco menu executed to perfection. Great indoor/outdoor downtown. Pride and passion rule this kitchen. A must stop on First Friday or any time you're looking to kick back!"}
{"text":"Omgggggg we had the pork belly tacos, tres leches French toast, Sonoran hot dog torts, and elote... Prob gonna puke. Best food I've had in a long time. Everything. We're so full. The pork belly melted in my mouth and the French toast literally tasted like the best fried ice cream I've ever had in French toast form. Definitely don't need the syrup. The hot dog, so so good, the bread was so soft and everything was so flavorful and delicious. So full. So glad we came here, we will be back! Maybe tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Paz Cantina Food Truck catered our wedding and it was amazing!! They provided amazing food and service with a laid back vibe that fit our backyard wedding. The Owner, Allen, is professional, relational, and was flexible to our desires. The staff that cooked and served the food were so wonderful!! I know they worked really hard because everything was perfect. We had a taco bar, served out of the food truck, with 3 kinds of tacos that were delicious and filling. My husband and I loved that everyone was able to eat as much as they wanted for such a great price. Plus, it didn't hurt that it tasted so amazingly flavorful and fresh! Paz Cantina, thanks for for all your hard work! We look forward to stopping in at the truck and the new restaurant!"}
{"text":"Best tacos and affordable! I love Paz!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place last month and have already been twice! The house margaritas are excellent!! I ordered the carne asada torta and the carne asada burrito and was not disappointed. The place has a very relaxed atmosphere. There was a dj one night and the other night several televisions were on with music playing in the background. I Highly recommend this place to meet up with friends and eat some delicious food!"}
{"text":"Okay the food is good, but $2.50 for a diet soda and $2.50 for a refill... that's No Bueno in my book. They need to work on the cost of drinks otherwise I'll be passing this place up rather than stopping to eat."}
{"text":"Offered the UFC fight said open at 5pm and first come first serve.  We got here before 5pm with a party of 8.  All the tables were reserved.  We were directed to a section of the restaurant that was not even open yet.  Once it opened we were informed that it also was reserved.  Get organized people.  We took our expensive drinking habits elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had a $3.50 steak taco and it was terrific!  Equally I have had the chicken taco and it was also fantastic.  Excellent patio with a nice view of Roosevelt Row with a great mix of fun tropical music.  Seriously, chips and salsa and a $3.50 taco, how can you beat that!?!? I love it.   Side Note: at the beginning they did have an issue with the chips not being crisp, that issue has since been resolved."}
{"text":"Just like the former restaurant, only in a truck. Cheap. Quick. Good people! Picnic tables for outdoor dining."}
{"text":"I can't even give this establishment one star. This place is poorly managed and understaffed. But wait till you here this... After dealing with this place being understaffed and finally being able to sit and eating $4.00 tacos (which were good) but could have bought at the food truck for $.99. Once finished I went to the restroom. Just like everything else at this place a line to wait. Finally getting in the restroom there is a load pounding on the door. Thinking it was someone who needed to go real bad I sat doing my \"Business\". However the pounding continued with the address of \"Open the door this is the police\". So I blurted out \"Excuse me I'm taking a s@$&\"! (Probably not the smartest thing to say) It continued... So I said I'm F@$&ing taking a s@$&! That was definitely the wrong thing to say. When I opened the door prepared to let this person have it the police officers (plural) proceeded to throat check me and slammed me against the wall (in a very nice way). They explained to me when the police say open the door I should open the door (which I agreed to 100%). I explained to them that what my intention was as soon as I was done wiping my ass. They told me someone told them someone was passed out in the bathroom and wanted to be sure they were ok. They apologized for what happened which I graciously accepted. Now here is the weird part of the story (you're thinking that wasn't the weird part) my wife felt it was necessary to tell the manager. So after looking for our waitress and requesting the management's presence a young man finally arrived. Expecting to be patronized he began to get in my face telling me he was the one who had the cops come to throat check me because I was in there doing drugs with someone! I was shocked! My wife could see my patients was about to run out... She began to get between me & him.  She let him know if that was the case the police would have taken me to jail... This man was still adamant he was right and we were all wrong. So with this being said if I were you I would get the $.99 tacos from the food truck instead of this poorly mismanaged establishment... And who ever owns this place you need to fire this idiot... Hire someone with competence and more help when you know that the evening Will bring a large number of paying patrons."}
{"text":"Paz is delicious! The Margaritas and Sangria were to die for. The Tacos are unreal! The service was fantastic. We were served promptly and our servers were attentive and friendly. We will be back for sure. In fact, we can't wait!"}
{"text":"Posted on behalf of my husband: \"This review *would* be an amazing 5 stars. I used to frequent this location, and as a matter of fact I came and had the tacos earlier this week. So honestly I give the food service 5 stars. The staff is USUALLY professional, nice, and they serve great food.\"   \"The only reason why this place gets 1 star from me tonight is because Yelp does not let reviewers give zero stars.\"  \"The outside bartender was over-the-top rude. I'm not talking about Mike who came over from Sochu House (who is great), I'm talking about the bald A-hole working with Mike tonight. Is was ridiculous.  I know they were busy, but when does asking a bartender for a drink turn into a crazy, unreasonable inconvenience? It was a BAR. Where you get, you know, DRINKS. Paz, please do your great reputation a favor and can that clown. Thanks.\""}
{"text":"Spent  my Sunday afternoon in downtown phoenix and decided to try this new spot  Paz I saw when I was at First Friday. Glad I did.  Paz takes a creative approach to making street tacos. I have never been a fan of Calamari, but if there is one thing on the menu you have to try, it would be the calamari street taco.   Omg, they are delicious!  The atmoshpehere is really cool and laid back. Great music and great staff.t . I almost forgot there are no watered down drinks here!!!  Try the Dangerous Liaison margarita."}
{"text":"The margaritas are small but tasty. The tacos are also on the smaller side but MANNNN have I been craving that fish taco since I had it. The environment is very nice, the music and layout are above par! I'll be back"}
{"text":"La Paz is a great cantina and a great place for tacos First off Anywhere that makes their tortillas by hand has got my attention Food has always been great and the bartenders definitely know their way around a margarita"}
{"text":"I love their fish tacos! They have $3 margaritas and they have ping pong, which is fun! Their tacos I think are a little over priced, but really good!"}
{"text":"Amazing vibes and atmosphere. If you like to eat on an artsy restaurant this is the place. They have indoor and outdoor spacr. It was a little pricey but the food was good."}
{"text":"basically just wanted to drop a line saying that getting a pork belly taco and a house margarita MIGHT be the most delicious $7 you can spend in the roosevelt area."}
{"text":"Street corn, chips and queso, crispy kale/Brussels, and last but not least the pork belly taco! All amazing."}
{"text":"This place! best 3$ margarita in town! Also the kale&quinoa salad is so delish also!  Great fast friendly service as well."}
{"text":"Came here for the ambience, which had actually attracted me from a different restaurant/bar on Roosevelt Row. Looked over, saw a new spot (opened last week I think?), and noticed the ambience. Everything urban, artsy, upbeat. Outside games, comfortable (posh but wholesome?) synergy inside. Place felt amazing when we came in!!   Ordered drinks, expecting the average, but they nailed it here as well! Craft cocktails, my Margarita Popper, amazing! Fresh squeezed lemon and limes (they said in every cocktail!!?) And there's a $3 house Margarita, all the time, that's made this way as well, pretty bomb!   Ok, so the food is where I'm lost for words of wonderfulness! Craft cocktails with great atmosphere can standard for us in AZ, but Paz's food takes it to another level.!.!!!!! Ordered taco sampler...blown away! Pork belly was over the top delicious, calamari taco was an absolute stand out, and apparently they have a new carne asado which blew my mind.  I'm back! Pretty sweet for one place to nail drinks, ambience, and authentic high end street tacos!!!! And everything, in my opinion, was underpriced. Thanks Paz for the new Go-to.!!!!!  ~love peace and taco grease ((stolen btw, but love it!!)"}
{"text":"Since I visited this place on my first trip to phoenix spring of 2015 i've been eager to return and last week I was happy to find that they've expanded, adding a second bar and cool ping pong table area while continuing to serve the same quality mexican food. The tortillas are perfect, the salsas are on point, and the carne asada tastes pleasantly more like the kind you'd have served from your favorite uncle's bbq grill than the generic diced steak they serve at most mexican restaurants. I definitely picked up citrus and beer in the marinade they used. The cantina portion of their business is also great, large selection of premium tequila, great sangria, and a fun ambiance. Shout out to Edder for being a great waiter and suggesting I stay as far away from scottsdale during my stay in phoenix as possible."}
{"text":"One of the best things about commuting or even cruising around Downtown Phoenix is the amount of amazing food trucks you can find. Back in the day it was so sketchy remember lol , but my oh my how things have changed. Hands down one of the best carnitas tacos I've ever had. Salsa was awesome, great service and fast! Especially for the amount of people they are cooking for at the office. Look for them when you're out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Service is slow and have not received anything ive asked for..  Cool place but service will have it shut down in no time at alll"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times, and the food and service is amazing! Will always recommended Paz to my friends!"}
{"text":"Loved this place when I was in town! Great food and even better service!"}
{"text":"Service was ok. Waitress seemed off. Food wasn't that great and drinks are small. I wasn't impressed at all. Wasted money on my meal because I didn't eat much of it."}
{"text":"Great place to go hang out at.  The staff was friendly and food is very tasty.  I will for sure come back here."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos! Definitely the best I have had in a while and certainly better than you would expect from a truck. They have a variety of options with very different flavor profiles with a representative sample of the different regions of Mexico as well as Central America and Cuba. And some of the menu items had funny names that made me laugh like the pinche burro and cholo fries. I was also excited they had a vegetable option for a side dish of fried kale and brussel sprouts. That dish fell a little short since it came out really really oily. I would not order that again. I did really love the tacos though and I hope they come back soon so I can get some more."}
{"text":"Best chips and salsa downtown!  Spicy!  Fish taco was huge and perfectly cooked. Great day drinking spot with inexpensive drink options and very reasonable food prices. Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Food is above average. Prices are reasonable. Service was atrocious. 1 hour with no food or an apology from the waitress.  Go for the street corn, but bring a book or something."}
{"text":"I had a craving for tacos, good homemade street tacos, so we found this place and made the drive into downtown Phoenix. The atmosphere was wonderful, the service was great, the chef even came out to greet us himself.  The Tacos. Oh the Tacos. Everything is small portion and made fresh. I had two Carne Asada and one Pork Belly. My girlfriend had two fish tacos. They were all amazing.  The price is very reasonable as well. I absolutely recommend this place, whether it's tacos, flautas, or margaritas you're in the mood for."}
{"text":"Delicious! Definitely a must try if you are in the Roosevelt District!  I had the sangria, white and red, delicious! The cheese enchiladas with rice and beans, were just like home!  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect from this little place, and made the mistake of ordering a dish -- chilaquiles -- that I thought I knew. Paz made it differently than I was used to, and I was disappointed. On the positive side, when I told our server that I didn't think the food had any taste, one of the chefs came out to talk to us. Michael was very sweet and we discussed just how variable \"Mexican\" food can be, in that every region makes their stuff differently. We got to talking and he told us about his favorite item, the pork belly. It sounded so good: slow roasted for 15 hours using Filipino style seasoning. He brought us a generous sample out to try, and it was WONDERFUL!  I will definitely go back for the pork.  Other positives: the menu is limited because they want everything to be as fresh as possible. You could definitely tats that in the salsa, which was fresh and bursting with green chili goodness.  My beloved got a breakfast burrito that was tasty.  I'll be back, and you should try it out."}
{"text":"Wow what can I say about this wonderful gem. One day driving with my lovely girlfriend we stumbled upon this awesome place and decided to be spontaneous and give it a look. We were greeted with a smile and great service. We had the Sonoran Torta and a some great drinks, we have been back since then on the night of a live band and lovely dancing. The vibe was amazing and so was our date. We will be back."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this restaurant after trying to go to sushi joint next door that is now completely closed down. They serve food until 12am, brunch and dinner! They have bottomless mimosas on the weekend that I'll have to checkout for sure and a decent cocktail list. Ordered the chorizo and egg torta and the $3 margarita (NOT on happy hour) it was pretty basic. Fresh citrus juices instead of sweet and sour, simple syrup and blue sauza tequila. It was a little sweet for my taste, so I'll just ask for less simple next time. $3 though, really can't complain! The torta was pretty good as well, I'd order it again. They had corn hole, and ping pong tables plus they are going to build a music venue in the back. I will most definitely be back to support this local business. Please, please, please succeed! Pallets of as such a let down, it would be nice to see a restaurant thrive in this complex."}
{"text":"I read the article in the PHX New Times and although it wasn't stellar, it peaked my interest. Let me just say, I'm so glad I stopped in for lunch today. I completely disagree with the commentary and urge everyone to try this genuinely cool & hip place that doesn't try to be. The carne asada torta had layers and textures of flavor similar to the ones I've had in Mexico City. I asked for the extra hot salsa and not only was it spicy, but it opened up my taste buds urging me to try something else on their menu. I topped off the torta with a PAZ margarita and it was the right blend of citrus, tequila and umph! One word describes my experience....SABOR! Will PAZitively be back...and spreading the word around town. On top of that, the host and server were top notch. Plus the art is available for purchase!"}
{"text":"Upbeat and lovely atmosphere. The tacos were quite impressive. The pork belly tacos are exceptional! My waitress was attentive and helpful. I definitely plan on coming back soon."}
{"text":"Had to bring this down to four stars. Went back for the third time yesterday and ... The food has only gotten better and the service has only gotten worse. It took our drinks 25 min to get to us!!! We ordered our drinks about 10 min before our food, and actually got our food before our drinks!? We ordered another drink as soon as our first arrived for fears of never getting another one. Our waters were empty non stop (this is how it always is here), and the waiter asked if we needed anything else three times... Each time we said yes the bill. I will still continue to come here because I know they are going to quick and the food is so amazing, but come on... Nearly half an hour for a pre made frozen margarita???"}
{"text":"This truck parks outside of cobra and they made some great choices in doing so. I ordered their cholo fries with chicken and WOWZA! I will literally run behind this truck just for these lol.  Apparently they closed down their restaurant? I'm not sure though if they are opening it up again maybe just renovating.  But from what I heard it wasn't? Hhmmmmm?  The only thing I didn't like was the menu. You can hardly see it most of the chalk is rubbed off. I would suggest maybe making small flyer type menus. Also the menu is pretty big there's so much to choose from and that can be quite overwhelming. Specially if you can hardly read what's there.   Their service is pretty quick. We got there at around 130am after we walked out of cobra. He line wasn't long but 15min and it was packed lol. The guy taking the orders was nice he dealt with my rambling in a very patient manner lol GREAT JOB!   Please go try Paz of you haven't yet. Hunt this truck down lol"}
{"text":"Paz Cantina Taco Truck is run by Michael and his awesome that makes up PAZ. The most recent spots you can catch them at is on Roosevelt row, behind the Made local store. Or A night at Cobra arcade bar. Menu is very satisfying to your wallets and pockets. They accept card and cash, food is all delicious typical and with a twist. You can catch them slanging your favorite burritos or indulge yourself in some cholo fries and add that pork belly you won't be disappointed. To be real, you won't be disappointed with anything you get especially the Mexican sprite! But everything is made with love and they take serving you to the next level making sure you receive only the best quality and service. So make sure you stop by, don't miss that skeleton mural with the lovely Tacos roaming the Phoenix streets! Stay hungry Phoenix stay local!"}
{"text":"I keep giving Paz more chances, but it's the same story every time. The food is really mediocre, and only carries substantial flavor when doused in salsa or cheese. They still think ingredients like plain, canned beans are acceptable in a city with extraordinary burritos on every corner. There are a couple of decent tacos, but that's it.   All of their tequila-based drinks taste the same. One Love margarita tastes like a frozen house margarita. Agave bramble tastes like...well a few blackberries in a house margarita. I can only drink the groovy, $3 margaritas so many times before I go nuts from the monotony! I'd switch it up with beer if their beer selection weren't so boring.   By the way, good luck getting drinks if there's a show. You really think two bartenders can handle all the people outside? Get freaking real.   Can we all just admit that Paz is by no means a good restaurant? We're only coming here for the events, right? Never do I ever say \"Hey Paz sounds great for food right now!\" It's more like \"oh, x artsy event is utilizing this space, may as well kill two birds with one stone\". RoRo is short on patio space, so everyone flocks here for the atmosphere and large group seating, and that's cool. It is certainly aesthetic, but everything on the block is.   There are better places for bargain cocktails.   You (will) know in your heart the food leaves you unsatisfied.   If there's something quirky going on here, I'm still down. I can keep my cool here with my friends for a couple hours. Then it's off to a place that doesn't squander so much potential."}
{"text":"Parking: This one is not so hard to figure out for my generation but with all do respect for the over 60 generation you may have a hard time understanding where to park. I parked as close as I could looking for the entrance of the place. Park as closest to the street as you can facing west.  Entrance: If you are new, the very first doors on the left hand side. Great sign says wait to be seated. There's bar seating and regular dining seating.  Waiter: Mine gave me the drink special menu, I was there during happy hour. He made sure my drink was full all the time.  The Food:       In my opinion, most Mexican restaurants around just don't cut it in Arizona but this one does.The food is usually not fresh or there is a lack of quality somewhere. The waiter started me off with chips and salsa. Chips are averaged, the salsa above averaged. I ate the whole bowl of it, pretty darn good.         Next, I ordered the Carne Guisada, which no one Arizona probably know what that is. However, in Texas it's one of the tacos I had ordered at least every other Mexican meal. It's like a Mexican seasoned gravy with steak. Even says a southern Texas favorite. The waiter came back to let me know they didn't have it for the day, talked about feelings went sour. For once, I thought I found my favorite Carne Guisada taco and now they don't have it. Not super upset, but upsetting because I didn't get to try it, stay tuned for the next trip.         The carne asado taco topped with onions, cilantro, slices of Serrano peppers, and salsa of somesort, on a corn tortilla. It was packed with meat so don't think they skimp with all the extra stuff. The meat very fresh to the taste almost seemed as if it had some smokey flavor to it. Gotta love it when you can tell the meat wasn't sitting in a container waiting for the next order, you could tell it was cooked to order. Now, lets move on to the Pork Belly. Mind you, I had Pork Belly the previous day at Flemmings and between the two tacos, I'd choose Paz because of the 15 hour packed flavors it claims on the menu. I'm not only a believer of the 15 hours, but a fan of these tacos. The pricing of food is where it should be for the quality.        I give it a 4 because the Carne Guisada was not available when I ordered it. Otherwise, you would of received a 5 from me. I really hope you guys have it available the next time I come in, was also told to try the shrimp tacos next."}
{"text":"The flavors at Paz Cantina are impeccable! Not only are the tacos fantastic the street corn is delicious!! Everyone raves about other places around he area, but this is hands down at the top of the list!! I wish I could take all my friends here!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. I ordered a carne a safe burrito and there was no meat in my burrito and when I complained they tried to blame me and say I ordered wrong. Wow unbelievable. I love meat, I am no where near a vegetarian. All they could've done was remake my burrito...I mean it was paid for but they wouldn't...just because they think that they are dealing with drunk people from the bar"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is extremely welcoming and the music sets a great mood. The food was great and the staff was very friendly! It's awesome to have a good Mexican food place close to work.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The Hippie was just what I was expecting and tasted pretty darn good. I also had the Asada which was ok. Will try again if they make it back out to us."}
{"text":"I came for the elote, the staff was super accommodating and even cut it off the cob for me. I compare everything to Elote Cafe so unfortunately this didn't come close. It was a bit heavy on the lime for me. Husband got a quesadilla and that was delish and I was appreciative of the check in deal of a free cheese cup! It was great! Oh, and the indoor music was way too loud for my taste."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough that UberEats will pick up from Paz, since I don't work anywhere near here. I was pleasantly surprised! I love me some authentic Mexican food and was wary to order blindly but I thought, what the hell I'm starving and I should've eaten lunch 2 hours ago.  I ordered the Pinche Burro, Shrimp Taco and Cholo Fries. The shrimp taco was delectable! Tiny and adorable but perfectly seasoned and a ton of shrimp in that little guy. It was the right price for what you got and the cholo fries were endulgent. I shared with a co-worker because really, I should not be eating that entire serving of fries on my own, although I thought about it.  The sad thing was how long it took to get to me, that's not Paz's fault but more Uber's. I bet it would've been amazing if I'd eaten it right from the truck."}
{"text":"first time here and we will be back.  We tried a bunch of tacos and they were all great.   The tortillas were fresh and just the right mix of soft and crispy.  I liked the cactus one the best.  They told us they will be adding more to the menu soon we we can't wait to back and try them too."}
{"text":"Our regular stop for tacos downtown. Great food, service and atmosphere. Haven't tried the tortas yet because the tacos are too good. However they look certainly amazing."}
{"text":"Ridiculously good tacos!! Tried them all and the cactus and pork belly are unique and amazing. The tortillas are homemade and delicious. Im picky but I would say it's safe to say these are the best tacos in Phoenix.   -Ignore Christopher T. That guy thinks he's some Siskel and Ebert of Yelp! and has nothing better to do with his life than critique everyone."}
{"text":"We decided to spent ours Memorial weekend on  Sunday afternoon in downtown phoenix and decided to try this new spot  call Paz Cantina.This place is absolutely amazing!  Everything about it.  Between me and my lady we had   Carne Asada tacos,has just the right amount of pepper tang, and I had the Carne Asada burrito, and the street corn was to die for it was delicious and we haven't had corn that good since my son made some on Friday just couple days ago.  And you can't go wrong with $3 house margaritas and $5 for the michelada made with Tecate, . Everything was crazy good!  Everything is made fresh their food is high quality, and they make the customer feel welcome.Over all I give it five big stars! I will definitely be back!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         P.S. they have live music. They are very true to the deep & rich culture of Downtown Phoenix. And they had corn hole, and ping pong tables to play. But if it was me I rather do beer pong instead, I think most of you guys would agree with me . Anyway Happy Memorial to my friends out there."}
{"text":"I sampled the shrimp, chicken, carnitas and pork belly tacos. All, yes all, were fresh, scrumptious and creatively genius! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Very expensive, especially for what you get.  $5 for a street taco?  You mean the ones that are $1 everywhere in this state and are all delicious?  They use canned ingredients instead of fresh produce.  So their $5 taco is worse than a $1 taco.  Congrats on making sub par Mexican food in Arizona and charging a premium for it.  Looking around, I understand.  Hipsters and rich people.  If that's you, this place is for you.  Personally, I'm a guy that will drop $6 for a craft beer because I'm fat and gluttony.  But I'm not dropping $8 for a domestic and $5 for a taco.  The place is very open though, so you can get a lot of \"look at me\" points while making it rain.  They don't have parking.  But you wouldn't know that, because there is a lot.  You can get fined heavily for parking there with no warning.  Beware."}
{"text":"It started out as a great idea for an otherwise lazy Sunday morning...let's hit up Paz for lunch.  I've been here a couple times with my grad school cohort during happy hour, and have had a light sample of the menu offerings...but never with the family, during typical eating hours, rather than typical drinking hours.  We were seated quickly and everything seemed like it was going to happen...the place was pretty packed, and there was a very large party seated on the patio across from us, so I do realize there were valid reasons for the wait staff to seem a bit flustered and rushed.  That, I can understand, and deal with...even when I'm hungry and expecting a bit more expedient delivery...what I can't deal with is watching parties who were seated  10 minutes after me getting their drinks first, then their appetizers and finally their meal.  I think they were on their fourth round of mimosas before I could get the waiter to bring me a fresh beer!    So as this was unfolding before my very eyes, I'm already reforming my opinion of this place, and it isn't very nice.  Three times we had to ask the waiter to bring water refills for our kids, they were drinking water because there were no other choices besides soda or alcoholic drinks.  Anyway....the food finally came, and it was as expected...excellent.  Pretty much everything on the menu at Paz is hand made, fresh...the tortillas, the guacamole, the frijoles..all of it.  You would be hard pressed to find a more authentic, home cooked-feeling, Mexican restaurant.  Seriously, the beans and tortillas take me back to my childhood, sitting in my best friend's kitchen as his mom stuffed us to the gills with the same, authentic, feel-good food.  Back to the service.  I ordered the Fayuca Shrimp Burrito....so amazingly tasty.  However, I was nearly ready for a new beer when the plate arrived....and as I had feared, mid-burrito, I ran out of beverage.  This was a major bummer.  I asked politely, more than twice for the beer I had ordered....but when I watched my late coming neighbor's getting their 4th mimosa refill as I sit there waiting for my second beer, I could not help myself but to ask for the manager.  The manager/owner came over to our table and we explained the frustration with our experience.  He was cool, tried to explain the reason for the less than stellar performance...and before the meal was done, he came back with a revised check, discounting our drinks....which we didn't ask for...so that was nice.  I was sitting there thinking how I always seem to only write reviews because a place I visit is something less than I expected...but by the time I left, I was glad that the owner came out and offered his assistance...the food at Paz is unmatched, and the atmosphere is nice...kinda hipster, but nice...with all that going for it, I suppose that it is possible we just happened in at an unfortunate time.  Because the owner took the time, and made the effort, I will gladly give this place another chance."}
{"text":"Pretty good tacos and cheap beer and all that, but damn, I'm gonna miss this place when it gets razed to the ground like the rest of Roosevelt."}
{"text":"Parking is awkward and dark. Service poor. I had to wait way too long to get seated and it was a quiet Wednesday evening!  Fish tacos were bland, tiny and EXPENSIVE!  Sadly, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Here's the deal:  Downtown Phoenix needed a place like this. You'd think tacos and margs in downtown phoenix would be a dime a dozen - but its far from it.   The $3 Paz Margs are so damn good.  I've paid 3x that much at other places and had a subpar drink. Seriously - get the damn margarita.  The Guacamole is divine. It's creamy and a nice serving - but best of all I can really taste the lime which totally made it for me.   All Tacos are extremely delicious. I got 3 of them and was completely full so don't let the small size put you off. They are worth it.   This is the perfect place to hang out on sunny day, with friends and dogs alike, and enjoy yourself. Salud!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. The food, the atmosphere, the service- all fabulous! To start, the complimentary chips and salsa were outstanding. The salsa was very flavorful without being too spicy. The taco and sweet corn were just delicious. And the house margarita was perfect! One of the best I've had. Only thing that wasn't amazing was the rice, which was a little dry. But the best part was the check- a full meal with drinks and tip for less than $25!! You can't beat that! I wish I lived in Phoenix so I could come back here all the time."}
{"text":"I had an art show here last week, decided to stay for music and ended up grabbing dinner and oh my lord! YES! For starters their margaritas are FRESH. Fresh citrus, good tequila, handmade and ONLY $3!! Not happy hour prices... All day every day $3!! After drinks I decided to eat to soak up the alcohol and their nachos are probably the best in the city! The quality of food is to die for and not to mention the owner comes by to check on his customers personally! I have been recommending this place to seton rand I go out of my way to eat here (I live in Tempe!) for the food and great service!"}
{"text":"Really a good spot. Stopped in here waiting for a friend to meet up before heading out and about downtown. Grabbed a seat at the bar and everyone was really friendly customers as well. Within no time I was hanging out with a bunch of strangers who I felt as if I'd known for years. Service was awesome even though they were crazy busy. Definitely a spot to check out not for just one drink, you'll want to stay awhile."}
{"text":"Excellent place, atmosphere. ... 1st time here with the wife.. we will miss it while it's being rebuilt but glad the food truck will continue to put out the great food. ."}
{"text":"The custom service was great! Everyone was very friendly and helpful.  The food is good! I love searching for a great margarita and I'm so glad I have found one here. The $3 Paz margarita, must try.  :) they've only been here about 67  days Kevin just told us. Spread the word it's awesome here."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!!! You really feel the LOVE thru the food they make for you here! GREAT happy hour deals, BEAUTIFUL and GENUINE staff, AMAZING art and music! stuck on this place !!"}
{"text":"The charging to refill chips was my only negative about this place.  They're tortilla chips for christ's sake.  Other than that, the music was great, the food was great, and the servers did a great job of combatting very loud music (if you're sitting inside), and getting our order correct and the food out perfect."}
{"text":"Great margaritas! Queso in nachos is amazing and chicken tacos are hard to beat. Perfect spot for Mexican food in Arizona."}
{"text":"I came here last night with my boyfriend to meet up with a couple of friends and I was really really impressed with the place.  Not only do they have an inviting atmosphere with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating but their food is as good, if not better than what I had heard.    The interior has a casual ambiance with local artists' paintings as decor.  An open kitchen, so that you can see your food being prepared and a friendly staff to boot.  Upon sitting down you get a basket of their housemade tortilla chips and salsa (also made in house).  Make sure to ask for the spicy salsa too....you won't regret it (although, I thought it could be a little spicier).    The menu is simple but filled with flavorful options.  I was torn between the quinoa vegan salad or the cactus tacos.  I chose the cactus tacos but did it without cheese.  I couldn't believe the flavor inside those little corn tortillas (which had a ton of flavor themselves).  They come small, so I recommend getting a few of them to start.  My boyfriend got the steak, pork belly, and chicken tacos.  I pretty much think he was in heaven.  He said his favorite was the pork belly and the steak.  We will definitely be back to try the quinoa salad and also because I heard they were going to be opening for brunch soon and I love my brunch...especially mimosas!     All in all, you'd be doing yourself a favor to coming to Paz...can't wait to see what is to come!"}
{"text":"Tried this place last night and it was really good! If there's one thing you order make it the pork belly taco! Amazing. The house margaritas and guacamole are also a must."}
{"text":"Great food Mike always hooks it up good I always order carnitas or carne asada burritos or tacos always made fresh !!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best mexican food in the Phoenix area! :) You should order the carnitas tacos!"}
{"text":"Ok... I can't say I have been waiting anxiously for this new restaurant to open, as it opened extremely quickly (and with little time between it and the last tenant of this space). I can say that when I heard a new taco place was opening near me, I was excited and came to try it as soon as I could. The husband and I came here after a Yelp event last night to get a couple drinks and have a (very small) sampling of the food.   The drinks:   Blackberry agave bramble- delicious. Not too boozy and a nice subtle level of sweetness mixed with a very 'fresh' taste. Would order again.   Cadillac Marg- a frozen margarita... also good, but less interesting. It wasn't just a plain old marg, don't get me wrong, it had more citrus notes in it (Orange I think?) anyway, it was solid,  but a classic.   The food:  Chips and salsas- this was legit. The chips were warm. The red salsa was surprisingly spicy (which I liked) and the green had a good mild-medium spice level, but more of a fresh flavor. I liked them both.   Tacos- here is where this place took a nose dive. This is a taco shop, right? We tried the carnitas and the pork belly. Both were WAY too fatty.... I'm talking extreme fat (I know, I know, pork belly is fatty, but you can skim some of the melted fat off after cooking, you know? Also, the pork belly was supposedly rendered and then fried... maybe it being fried added even more unnecessary fat... I dunno).... the grease ran off the tacos... and not the good orange -y kind of grease that is mixed with some kind of sauce or something... no, just white pure fat grease. It was like an oil slick in your mouth. The toppings on both tacos were good... I think they just need to work the kinks out of their meats. With so many delicious and innovative taco places popping up in town (read: santos, etc), this just didn't stand up, but it does have potential and, with some time and adjustments, could be a great taco place (with a great location)."}
{"text":"OK. Here's the deal. This place is absolutely amazing!  Everything about it.  Between the four of us in our party we had:  Carne Asada tacos, carne Asada Tortas, flautas, fish tacos, guacamole and the house margaritas. Everything was crazy good!  Everything is made fresh. Chips came out hot!  They make a fresh batch every 10 minutes. Salsa was ridiculous!  And to top it all off, our server, Noelle, was as good as it gets. Friendly, informative, and all over it. Portions are small and inexpensive. But consider it al a carte and order plenty to share.  You can't go wrong.  The owners cook everything themselves with pride. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"We came at the recommendation of a friend that said it was dog friendly.  I'm so glad that we did!  Three people, three dogs.   The street tacos, while a bit on the small side, were delicious.  The Paz Margarita is made with fresh ingredients, and was yummy (okay, I had two.)  We also had the kale and quinoa salad--yum!  The fruit plate.  Also yum!  and the gaucamole.  Okay, the gauc was a bit small for the price, and a teeny bit bland for me, but perfect for my dining companions.  To be fair, the food is so good, and so fresh, the prices are reasonable.   I had the Taco del mar which was an amazing street taco with lightly breaded calamari in it.  TRY IT!!  My friends had the Nopales tacos and they both loved it.  Chef Michael came out and said hello to our dogs, and introduced himself--my dog barked at him-I was SO embarrassed. But he was gracious about it.  He is a charming man with great talent-please go try his food and  I dare you to tell me I'm wrong!  We left and were already talking about coming back.  Not 5 stars yet--service was a bit slow getting around to us, and I thought maybe they were afraid of my dog.  Not that I would have blamed them a bit, she's a German Shepherd with attitude.  Regardless, go see Haran, he was our waiter once things got started and he's a delight as well.  I expect this review to go to 5 stars after my next visit."}
{"text":"This place is great and has awesome food! Customer service has always been outstanding and the prices are very reasonable. I recommend their pork nachos. They also have very good chips and salsa! I cant wait to eat there again!!"}

{"text":"I haven't been to a place so good, authentic, and unique since I've been to my old favorite back in Bronx, New York. I say old because this is my new favorite. I'm definitely a regular now."}
{"text":"Loved it! It's so colorful and chill. Perfect place to relax with a cocktail and friends. The staff is amazing. Their menu is pretty great. I ordered the Sonoran dog torta which was delicious. It had 2 sliced hot dogs, salsa, bacon, and beans. My husband had pork belly tacos and they were perfect. Crispy and delicious.   The ultimate winners here are the drinks.they are very well-balanced and thought out. My husband had the Basil drop and it was pretty refreshing. I had the Dangerous Liaison which could write possibly be one of my favorite cocktails ever. It had tequila, bourbon, aperol, and a citrusy juice. Talk about a heavenly buzz...  Oh and the music. Did I mentón the music? They had a live dj who was cranking them out like there was no tomorrow. I had a hard time leaving cause I heir wanting to listen to whatever he was going to play next. I went on a Sunday evening, so I'm not sure if they  only have a dj on Sundays or if it's an everyday thing."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!  Got there at 1:00pm didn't get entrees till after 3:00 pm.  Food was good but nothing special.  Patio seating was nice when you're not being ignored.  Not sure if I'll ever be back."}
{"text":"Our group has come here a couple of times recently for dinner and drinks.  I'm not a huge fan of the margaritas (the pitchers taste like they're made from a store-bought mixer), and the Mexican food we've had has been decent but not mindblowing (nachos, tacos).  However, Paz really stands out when it comes to environment.  Want to play ping pong?  There are two tables in the room next door!  Feel like looking at art?  There are some really strange paintings hanging around all over the place.  Feel like getting drunk on a patio while attempting to play cornhole?  You're in the right place.  This is a place where you can wander between buildings with a drink in your hand, chatting with friends and playing backyard games.  It's like being at a friend's BBQ.  All they need is a pool.  Unfortunately I've been informed this site is closing, so I'm just crossing my fingers that the business keeps the same atmosphere at their next location."}
{"text":"Relaxed atmosphere. Chips and salsa at table are way above average. The carnitas street taco was delicious. The star of the meal was the street corn- OMG- I'd come back here and just order the street corn... Like 3! I had it off the cob to avoid the \"corn in teeth\" look. So amazingly delicious. Bonus- I didn't know they discount the tacos on Taco Tuesday!! Woo hoo! My amazing taco was $2.25!!!!!! I'm glad we tried this place! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"So often when visiting an area, you only learn of the gems when your time nears the end. Tthat's the case with this place. It's a locals Mexican restaurant that is all fresh, all the time. They make all their own food and is a great place for those of us with a gluten intolerance.  I enjoyed the Tinga and Carne Asada  and I was very pleased. My husband had the Tinga Torta and he enjoyed it as well; it was served on some sort of bread that was different from most presentations. Too bad we aren't here long enough to come again. Our only con is their margaritas are weak; but then again, what can you expect from an 3 drink."}
{"text":"Seriously SO good. My new favorite taco place. I got the carnitas and pulled pork tacos and the corn and it was so tasteful and full of flavor. The server was so friendly and quick to wait on us. I got the house margarita and that was good, but I'm pretty sure they use lime juice not fresh squeezed because it was a little sugary. The corn was to die for delicious and I haven't had corn that good since actually being in Mexico. I'd definitely come here again with some friends for bottomless mimosas and tacos; perfect Saturday or Sunday hangout."}
{"text":"Amazing location and good food but horrible service. Went 3 times trying to see if I hit a bad day originally and was sadly disappointed.  Takes forever to get service and no apologies for the long delay. Food delivered but no utensils to eat with and had to go to bar to ask for roll ups before the food got cold. Never saw our server after the food was delivered and had to ask someone else for our check. The food was delicious but definitely not worth the lack of customer service."}
{"text":"You have to try this place-  A genius fusion of authentic Mexican food with an urban downtown vibe. When I first seen the once abandon corners spring to life I was in awe the space is beautiful the seating open and inviting. But don't let the atmosphere steal the show because the food is  delicious. So far my favorite has to be the huge brunch chorizo burrito it seems to be built for 2 cuz I'm a big eater and I can only eat half. Then there is the pork belly taco and omg the torta that's made of hotdogs sounds odd but it's so good with the avocados in thick cut bacon. The stalf is friendly and I love the  energy there makes me smile. If I'd point out anything that needs improvement that would be faster service although honestly I didn't mind because there's so much to see and hear with live music or dj most evenings this is my  urban retreat."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. A place for anyone of all ages. The house margarita is 3 dollars everyday all the time. It's strong as hell so it's def worth it."}
{"text":"Walking up I was excited to give this place a try just based on the look and the art on the wall. The open windows, how big and spacey it was. Then I sat down, it went downhill from there. Our waiter had no patience, rather rude and hardly came around. He was the worst from all the others hustling and being friendly, ordering drinks was basically impossible w him as he was never around and it wasn't that busy he couldn't check in on us. We all ordered the Paz margarita, it was gross. All I tasted was the bad margarita mix. We all ordered tacos, mixture off all and I can say I wasn't disappointed w the carne asada. Shrimp tacos were bland, basically boiled shrimp thrown on a tortilla. When it came time to get the check again our waiter was nowhere to be seen, I had to hunt him down. All in all I was disappointed. Trendy for sure. Nice set up. Bad service. Not great drinks. Not bad place to people watch if that's all you want to do."}
{"text":"First time in Phoenix and loved the ambiance. Limited space so had to sit at the bar, but the food and drinks were delicious. I'm always looking for a tasty fish taco and Paz did it for me."}
{"text":"Very, very good! Thank you for coming out to the State48 Headquarters Grand Opening party. It was great. I loved the Asada taco with Guac street taco and the quesadillas were yummy."}
{"text":"House marg is a god send. DELISH and $4. I had a Paloma type drink as well which was top notch and the micheladas are refreshing and flavorful. Chips and salsa are fresh, crispy, and limited! Caveat emptor - if you are one to nosh on chips before you eat, slow your roll or pay extra. I had a crispy pork belly taco which was muy sabroso (yummy) and had so many great textures. MUST HAVE! My mom had the carne asada taco which was ok. The shrimp taco was probably my favorite. Street corn was A+++ and competes with Gallo Blanco (RIP) if you were a fan of their street taco. It can be loud in there. It is a concrete box. Whateva."}
