{"text":"A great place to people watch and grab a healthy bite while shopping. 

If possible, try to get a booth that faces the window. You'll have nice view of the Eaton's Christmas tree and reindeers. 

The menu has a few Eco friendly / sustainable items which are a nice touch,  but otherwise nothing really eye catching. The ingredients are sourced locally for a farm to table approach. Prices are reflective of these features. 

Overall,  I'd come again. It's a healthy (and less squishy)  alternative to the food court with an interesting view."}
{"text":"Beautiful first experience! Yesterday I've decided to try the food at this restaurant (before I would just have a drink&a snack at the bar on the lower level which is a lovely place as well). It was during the crazy Christmas shopping time but I managed to get the table right by the window. The view is great, especially if you like people watching ;) The waitress was a very nice knowledgeable young lady who helped me to make right choice as I was hesitant between a few dishes. She described each dish and made some worthy recommendations. The Ceasar salad for starter was to die for. I'm still thinking about it. It has an interesting presentation and it's so good!! The salad is cut in half and slightly grilled, and served with a mildly spice Ceasar dressing and herb croutons... my mouth is watering right now!... I also had a BV burger and fries. BV burger was cooked to perfection and was massive. The fries are rightly cooked and rightly shaped, and come with a very fresh lemony dipping sauce. I couldn't finish it all as it was a lot of food (and mind you-I am a big eater!). Oh,and I also had a seasonal cocktail from the Chef :) Their cocktails are great! Love this place and dream of coming back for those Ceasar salad:))"}
{"text":"The restaurant is really good.  We were seated by the window which has an amazing view of the Toronto Eaton Ctr....picturesque!
Food is a bit pricey but worth it for a once in a blue moon lunch/dinner.  Big portions. I had the short rib sandwich and it was really flavorful and tasty and comes with fries and aioli which is really good.  Service was on point, helpful and friendly. 
Taking 1 star away as it's a bit pricey"}
{"text":"I came here for a corporate lunch and they were very accommodating and managed to put together a table of 10. The server was also really patient with us =) 

I had the short rib grilled cheese and it was DELICIOUS. I got it with the side salad- which was just ok but it's salad. Had the entire thing with fries not been more than 1000 calories, I would have gone with fries lol. The prices were reasonable too for a downtown core restaurant. The rest of the table seemed to really enjoy their meals as well.

Would come back."}
{"text":"Two words: HAPPY HOUR!

Various wines, beers and apps are $5 from 4pm to 6pm daily. Highly recommend the fried shrimp off of this happy hour menu.

I've dined here a few times now and the service has always been great. Cozy ambience and not too loud for good conversations to be had. My favourite is getting a booth by the window and people watching Eaton centre below.

Almost everything I've ordered here has been really tasty. HIGHLY recommend the brussel sprouts with pork belly. The other two most memorable dishes I've had was the Shrimp Linguini with spicy tomato sauce which had portion of deliciously charred grilled shrimps, and the Sautéed Chicken with Angel haired pasta which has cream sauce and tomato sauce.

All in all a solid lunch spot or for after work drinks and snacks."}
{"text":"Service as oky, not bad but very average. Food was not bad, but very expensive for what it is and the portion was very little. We left the restaurant hungry after ordering an ap and two entries. For the same price and better food, I'd rather go the keg."}
{"text":"Had lunch here after a visit with Santa.  We came with small children and felt it was a great dining experience with the kids.  There was lots of room which was good and we could park our strollers.  I had the tomato basil soup that was really nice!  My husband had a burger.  The fries were good and hot and fresh just a tad salty for my liking.  They have children's meals and children's crayons and activities . We also shared the Brussels sprouts app with our friends.  The lunch was reasonable $55 after tax for the two of us (our kid split a meal with our friends' child because they don't eat much)."}
{"text":"My friend recommended \"the restaurant in Nordstrom\" after we spent the morning in downtown and were really looking forward to lunch.

It's kinda funny that it's tucked in the underwear section of the store, but walking into the restaurant it's very modern with a great view of the mall. 

I ordered the cilantro lime shrimp salad, thinking that it's going to be hearty as the waitress said it would be. The shrimp were definitely the biggest I've seen in a salad, but the rest was lacking. Even my friend's side salad looked more filling! The sauce was very delicious though. 

The dessert portions were very fair, and very delicious. I got the maple syrup apple crisp, and my friend got the creme brûlée which looked amazing. 

Our waitress and the manager were both really great and made sure we had a pleasant experience. The greeter at the front could have been friendlier and more welcoming."}
{"text":"This was a planned visit sort as it was mother's day which judging from the unsurprisingly line ups at flower, chocolate, brunch spots etc etc is the mother of all days for sales for these type of spots.
We required accessible seating so started testing waters in this area. This place took reservation online and I called in to confirm that the seating was appropriate. The place has a nice setup and is located on the 3rd floor of the Nordstrom and has one window overlooks the mall and apparently there is some outdoor seating though I didn't spot it. 
I had gone through the menu beforehand so knew what to order. There is a good wine/drink list so if you are just looking to unwind in a decent place this spot will do. 
I ordered the tomato basil soup and short rib and cheese sandwich. The soup was decent. The short rib which comes slathered with a jam was so so. The jam just overpowered everything on the sandwich. I think they could help this version by using a stronger cheese or less jam. The side of fries were good. Nicely cooked and crisp and served warm.
Other people who ordered the turkey sandwich seemed to enjoy it. 
We decided to stick around for dessert as didn't want to wander around. Oh boy I am not liking this new calorie count on each item. The dessert bread pudding we chose  had a whopping 1500 calories!!!! This pushed us to share the dessert as oppose to getting one each. I think my penchant for dessert wants to get an exemption of the calorie count on desserts please.
The dessert was very rich as expected and while visually appealing was just OK. I think I might try their other options for dessert as they looked promising. 
Now for the improvement part while the staff is friendly and plenty I think they could use a bit of training. After we got our menu there wasn't anyone to take our order for a while. Mid lunch service wasn't any better as even though there was plenty of staff walking around we had to flag someone each time to get a refill etc. I hope this improve with time on the service end for sure.
2.5 stars with half star deducted due to untrained service."}
{"text":"I was walking around Nordstrom and noticed they had a restaurant upstairs with large windows overlooking the mall (and the beautiful Christmas tree that's up at Eaton's right now), so I had to stop by even though it was well past lunch and I wasn't too hungry at the time. Bar Verde is very spacious with ample seating for diners. The interior is modern and clean - perfect for a date or just a good meal after a long day of shopping.

Between the two of us, we ordered drinks and a calamari appetizer to share. Everything tasted decent as expected. Service was pretty good, and our waitress made the effort to check in on us every now and then. Would recommend as the restaurant is worth trying, but because the menu was not very special I probably won't be back in the near future."}

{"text":"Excellent service. The only reason I removed a star was the salmon was overcooked. Otherwise, great dining experience and wonderful ceasar. The candied bacon really was a nice touch! Perfect spot for a mid shopping refuel break."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday night and it was dead. Our server was not very attentive. He seemed distracted. We asked him for water, he forgot, we asked 2 other people that walked by and they forgot. 
We ordered the calamari and the chicken tacos to share. They food was pretty good, but the bad service overshadowed it."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food great. Service excellent. Reservations accepted. And more importantly, never too busy! 

Great place to energize up before you shop till you drop. Or not drop  because your tummy is happy!"}
{"text":"Whoever decided to put restaurants/cafe inside The department store is very smart. After windowshopping for the whole afternoon, one is bound to get tired and in need of hydration. This was the predictment we found ourselves in this afternoon. We just wanted to get some water, however we were too lazy to leave Nordstrom.

We went into bar verde, thinking to just get a glass of regular water or juice and then when we saw the menu we were just too tempted to try.

We had the tomato soup which was very fresh and seasoned just right. We then try the burata with apples. It's basically green apple cubed and mixed with chopped walnut and ricotta cheese. The flat breads that came with the salad was very crispy and yummy

And this point I really wish we didn't have lunch. Or so. Just these two dishes that we couldn't bring ourselves to eat more. I will definitely return because there are a few items on the menu that I would like to try in the future."}
{"text":"It's on the 3rd floor of Nordstrom. We had a fantastic lunch here today. Chicken tortilla soup, stone fruit and quinoa salad, seared tuna salad and grilled short rib cheese sandwich. Capped off the meal with the white chocolate bread pudding. Everything was fresh and delicious. Great choice if you're in the Eaton center area and want something a bit classier."}
{"text":"Everything was going amazing when we arrived. The service was okay and place was clean and most importantly the cups and utensils were clean. But don't get me started on the food, I ordered a sautée chicken with angel noodles. Oh my god, that shit was SOURRRRRR. The dish came with a lemon I didn't even squeeze the lemon and it was already so fucking sour. Jeez. And they didn't have a bathroom in the restaurant I had to leave to go to Nordstrom's. I had really high expectations for this restaurant but guess what, I left with disappointment. Oh well."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for drinks or dinner and the food is always amazing.   They always ask if you have a reservation, but it's never busy, so not sure what's up with that.

The Brussels sprouts are easily the best thing I've eaten on the menu.  The pear and prosciutto salad is also a winner.

The staff is very friendly (sometimes too friendly).

My one complaint is that the prices seem a bit steep."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome and great for sharing!  The service was good and all staff was attentive.  Just an FYI - they have a great kids menu too.  Cocktails are definitely worth trying.  Top items tried: ahi tuna poke and short rib grilled cheese sandwich."}
{"text":"Amazing service at this location. Staff are always extra sweet and friendly! Every time I come, they are all just lovely people. I've never had bad service and this is hard to say when I come here at all different times and days of the week. 

The creme brûlée is one of the best I've had in Toronto!! Quite a decent size compared to ones from other restaurants. I haven't had food here, only always coffee and dessert. 

The space is so relaxing and calming. The decor is simple and pretty. Lighting is perfect. Just a nice getaway from the noise and all the hustle and bustle of the shoppers."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night around 6:30pm with a group a of 5, the place is half empty and we are seated right away. Long story short, the price is reasonable, service is great, and the food is excellent.

I ordered the skirt steak ($28.95), it is very juicy and tender. The potatoes and mushrooms are perfectly seasoned as well. 

I also ordered the white chocolate and raspberry bread pudding($8.95) to share with my friends. Nothing too special. 

Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"On a Friday early evening, this restaurant was bumping with everyone wanting a cinq a sept before the weekend. I have to say, I was very impressed with the how beautiful the restaurant looked. The massive floor to ceiling windows looking onto the Eaton Center wasn't like anything I'd ever see in a restaurant before.

Getting to the food, since we were only going for a light meal, we opted for the grilled romaine caesar and mushroom flat bread (on a side note: they put the calorie count on the menu - I like the movement towards, perhaps not necessarily healthier eating, but more conscious eating).

Hooolyyy molyyy, let me tell you, I am a lover of all caesar salads with the one from Jacobs at the very top of my list, until... now. Grilling the romaine brings such a robust, charred flavour to the dish and the chipotle dressing was a nice touch (not too heavy, which is always a plus in my books).

The mushroom flat bread was alright, nothing too special about it. 

The food and ambience was great - however, I'd recommend the restaurant iron out some kinks. Perhaps it's a new restaurant so things aren't running entirely smoothly just yet, but I felt service could have been improved. My server didn't provide the best experience; he didn't seem like he wanted to be there, was not personable, he was complaining how loud it was in the restaurant, dropped my drink order (no comp, no apologies, no nothing), and when it came time for the bill, he expressed his frustration with the machine not working and a previous client not paying the bill. I ended up paying with cash as I did not want to wait any longer.

I'd be interested in coming a second time for an actual meal and tasting the rest of the menu.

P.S. Ordered the soup of the day to go for my boyfriend (New England clam chowder, his favourite) and he really enjoyed it when we got back home. I had a taste of it, and if it's ever on the menu again, I'd order it as well."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for dinner here before seeing a show at Massey Hall.  I don't think many people think about going to Nordstrom for a pre-show meal, but it was close by, took reservations and the menu looked tasty.  When we arrived, we sat at a table overlooking the interior of the Eaton Centre.  I was a little surprised because I saw a photo on Yelp that showed a patio...I asked if they had a patio and the hostess advised that they don't have a patio.  

The reservation was for 6pm.  I was expecting the dinner menu (which included entrees), but the menu only had appetizers, salads and sandwiches.  I didn't mind b/c I had the short rib grilled cheese in mind anyway.  I ordered that along with a glass of prosecco.  The bill came to around $40 including tip.  A bit expensive for a sandwich and a drink.  The food was okay, and decently hearty with the short rib.  The aioli that came with the fries was pretty good.  

My friend had the chicken sandwich, which looked pretty good and had real pieces of chicken breast.  My other friend had the chicken taco appetizer and a side of fries.  The tacos were smaller than I expected, but makes sense as it was an appetizer.  You get 4 tacos.  She said they were just okay.  

Our server was very friendly, and split the bills for us."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a friend and I left feeling very satisfied. He ordered all day breakfast and I ordered the Short Rib Grilled Cheese. 

Get this - the Grilled Cheese is made with Sharp White Cheddar, Short Rib and Blackberry Jam. You're thinking why would you put Jam & Meat together? It was delicious! I was so surprised that I enjoyed it. 

I would go back just for this sandwich! The service was also great. 

Keep Eating, 

Angela"}
{"text":"Checking out the nordstrom and got hungry so we stopped by Bar Verde on the 3rd floor.

Overall, the food and service were great and the prices were around keg/red lobster prices which is reasonable. Plus it can't be too cheap it's Nordstrom.

We tried:

Cilantro lime chicken tacos: these were pretty good, they do come as crunchy tacos so they will break and spill. But the flavour was good. They give you 4 per order.

Shrimp linguine with spicy tomato sauce: this was a fantastic, satisfying dish. The pasta had so much flavour, just enough heat and the shrimp tasted really good

Salmon maple bacon sandwich: this was a very tasty, messy sandwich. The bacon overpowers the salmon so couldn't really taste it. 

Apple blueberry martini: their drinks don't skimp on alcohol I will confirm that."}
{"text":"This is my go-to for corporate lunches and client meetings. The atmosphere is quieter and more subdued than other nearby restaurants. 
The food is great, as well. My favourite is the Black Pepper Ahi Tuna Salad. Very well done. 

You can't go wrong here; just get your coffee downstairs - I don't know why, but it's better there. 

Compliments to the wait staff, too! Very friendly and upbeat bunch! Doing a great job."}
{"text":"Ever since Nordstrom opened in the Eaton Centre, I've had my eye on the third-floor eatery with its booths facing the mall. So when the opportunity arose to grab a bite there on a cold Saturday, I leapt at the chance.

We did indeed get a mall-facing booth and the view is nothing short of hypnotic. But how's the food, you ask? It's pretty darn tasty.

I got the SXSW Sandwich (\"blackened chicken, pimento cheese, b & b pickles, radish, butter lettuce, artisan roll, sea salt french fries\"): This is quite a tasty little sandwich. The chicken itself might've been just a tad too dry, but the various flavors within certainly compensated (although the \"blackened\" aspect was a little more subtle than I might've liked). The fries and accompanying lemon aioli were delicious.

The service was top-notch and the place definitely perpetuated the chill vibe afforded by that superb view."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, sat by the window (nice view of the Eaton centre), ordered burger & soup. Service was good, friendly staff! Located inside Nordstrom on 3rd floor. If you are shopping at the mall and want to dine at a restaurant, you should check out this place!"}
{"text":"Popped in for a bite, atmosphere is great, service is great! I had the tomato soup and Margherita flat bread both exceptionally good. The flatbread is a little small so don't make it a main meal but it is like nothing else  I have had. So fresh and simple and tasty!!
Must stop by this place. The people watching of those shopping in the mall is nice too haha!"}
{"text":"Another yay for Nordstrom! We've been to Bar Verde twice already, and keeping in mind that this restaurant is still fairly new, they are doing everything right. The food is incredible. The menu is not huge, but everything they offer is delicious. My favourite so far has been the grilled romaine small plate and a fish and chips main that is not on the menu. Their French press coffee is amazing, so don't be disappointed they don't have espresso drinks (they have a full café on the first floor). The desserts are also to die for. The restaurant itself is beautiful, with a huge window facing the mall. The bar has electrical outlets at every bar stool. They've thought of everything!  The staff is incredibly friendly, helpful, and they are good with children. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice during lunch and I'd have to say both times have been very pleasant. I enjoy getting a seat in one of the booths and people watch everyone walking in Eaton Centre :) Most time's I've gone here early (11:30-11:45 for lunch) since it gets pretty packed. I absolutely love their tomato soup, very tasty. I also like their baked potato soup which they have here and there as a daily offering. I usually pair it with a flat bread. The mushroom and neapolitan are my faves. I also enjoy their iced tea. They brew their own iced tea, so the tea isn't super cold but it comes with a slice of lemon. I get this half sweet and they also give you a refill during your meal! I would recommend coming here for lunch over going to the fast food restaurants if you want a nice meal during shopping or even during your lunch break on a weekday."}
{"text":"Easy to reach location in the shopping center. The setting is nice and the food is good. My only concern is the staff who is not really attentive to guests. They do their job according to the restaurant's training \"standards\" (said the waiter) and they are not really interested in customers' concerns or satisfaction..."}
{"text":"Popped in here for a lunch on Monday and didn't have to wait for a table for 2 (arrived around noon) - got seated in a booth with a cool interior view of the Eaton Centre. The shrimp pasta was really good, and my friend got a chicken salad with berries which she said was great. Homemade Lemonade was nice but a little sweeter than I usually like it. Desert menu looked fantastic - will have to come back to sample that for sure!"}
{"text":"Nordstrom just opened its doors in Eaton centre and Bar Verve is one out of the two restaurants in its establishment.
Service was efficient, with good wait time eventhough it was lunch hour on a weekend.
Alcohol list serves up a unique choice and they definitely don't skimp on the alcohol. Worthy for what you pay for in terms of portion wise.

Thai Chilli Mussels tasted good with a sizeable portion. It was the right amount of sour, curry and coconut milk to it.
The wild salmon with white beans and kale was nice too.. The salmon seemed to be overcooked hence a little dry. But the white beans were a little smoked before it was topped up with the miso sauce.
Chicken angel hair pasta was mediocre. The pasta was overcooked and to soft. Not al- dente bite to it. 
Overall it was a nice experience. They only have gluten- free pasta, but I'm sure if possible they have other dishes that can cater to gluten free intolerant customers too. 
Certainly a place to grab a bite after tired from walking and shopping in Nordstrom."}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5/5.

I really like Bar Verde for a quick and tasty lunch. I've been here three times since it opened, and I will definitely go back. I don't think I would come here for a date night, because the ambience just isn't there. It is nice and bright for the day time, with a great view looking over the mall if you love people watching!

The service has improved since it opened, for sure. The first time we went there, just after it opened, our server was flustered and the timing of everything was off. The drinks were really slow. As a side note, I'm obsessed with their gin and cucumber cooler. It's sour, with just enough sweetness. I normally stray away from cocktails because I find them too sweet, but this is a delicious one. 

I love that the restaurant has calorie information on the menu for more informed dining. I normally don't order meal salads when I go out, but I quite enjoy the salads here. I've had the chinese chicken salad and the ahi tuna salad, which are both stand out. The ahi tuna salad has a lot of great textures and flavours, with a bit of fried wonton, bell peppers, cabbage and edamame. The only thing I would say was last time I had the ahi tuna salad, the tuna wasn't overly fresh. It tasted a bit fishy. But I would give it another chance because it was better the last time I had it. 

My mom always has the angel hair pasta with chicken, which is delicious. Large portion as well - you can probably take half home for dinner."}
{"text":"I've dined here a few times and the service is usually pretty good. Their breakfast is my favourite. Their desserts are good too. But I'm giving this place a 2 star because I had their chicken tacos last night and got food poisoning. I didn't eat any other meat that day nor had anything else after those tacos. The chicken was shredded in a green sauce. Easy to hide any raw meat. Not happy, and this definitely ruined Bar Verde for me. I wont be going back again."}
{"text":"Not bad.
Food not bad (3.5)
Service is nice(4)
Good environment (4)


Main reason I gave 3 for food is the food did not meet my expectations.
We ordered chicken pasta and taco, they were nice, but just nice.

I would not come again just for\"  not bad\" food.


I know how to keep a good diet ( like how to eat healthy), all of their food are \" good food\" but the taste, well, the main reason I go restaurants is for a good taste.

Taco (3.5)  tastes nice, price is ok.
Pasta(3.5)  I considered the price, the taste not worth, but chicken was nice.($22)

No washroom."}
{"text":"I went in for lunch with colleagues. I was hoping to order rib sandwich, since people got food posioning by the uncooked chicken in your restaurant. I avoided order your pasta and pizza, since you don't know how to cook pasta and pizzas. The pizzas are just too tiny to call them pizzas. The server said that they are out of rib sandwich. I decided to order your Brick Oven Steak Salad out of choices. I asked you for medium-rare steak, but you just couldn't get it right. The steak came out almost well-done."}
{"text":"Happy hour specials are a good deal. apps, wine, and spirits all for $5 each. 

Good for after work drinks"}
