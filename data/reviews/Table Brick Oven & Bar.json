{"text":"Good service. Food was very well presented. Taste was very good. Nice experience. My first time here and I'm very pleased. Desert was out of this world."}
{"text":"Mother's Day, a train wreck. Hostess was confused and apologetic. (Untrained?) Never saw a manager. (Who was in charge?) Even though we had a reservation, and an elderly woman in our party, it took 15 min to be seated. No waitress spoke to us for another 15 min. (Understaffed?) Empty tables all around us, clearly well below capacity. Since they couldn't handle the number of people already seated, thankfully the hostess was turning people without reservations away. Significant loss of potential revenue on what should be a big dollar day for the restaurant. With too few waitresses, people were leaving tables and going to the bar to get their own drinks. 

Once we got a waitress, she was very competent, friendly and apologetic. Limited menu selection, but plenty of choices. Kitchen staff was holding up well. The food was OK, better than expected, and delivered in a reasonable period of time after placing the order. I would have given Table Brick Oven & Bar 3 stars, maybe 4 stars without the chaotic greeting and slow service."}
{"text":"Really good service in the bar. We had a martini and wine, cheese board and the duck wings. The duck wings are awesome! Down to earth staff makes you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Great casual place to eat even on short notice. Love the live music!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place.  The service was good, the food was good - but the distinct lack of patrons on a Sunday afternoon still weirded me out.  

I ordered the chips, queso, guac & pico de gallo and a flatbread.  Both were good.  I liked that they had a lunch portions & specials."}
{"text":"I'm blasting this place because the entire restaurant staff was in a blatantly terrible mood, noticed by my table and other patrons of the restaurant.  It's a shame, too because the food actually was pretty good and the restaurant did have a trendy feel to the place, which would set it apart for the local scene in Murrysville.

Maybe lunch isn't the right time to come, but it really turned me off...and I'm new to the area and would love to get some \"regulars\" in the rotation.  

Not sure if this place is going to get a second chance...and if it does, it won't be for a while."}
{"text":"A very cool place. Nice ambiance with a live band the night I was there. The pork was excellent!!"}
{"text":"Table is a cute place but my food was way too salty. :( I remember eating at Table a few years ago and thinking the food was amazing but the second time around, not so much."}
{"text":"I've passed this restaurant many times over the last couple of years while driving to see my youngest son who went to school in Johnstown. I never stopped because I knew that the first thing I would be doing in Johnstown was to take my son out to eat. Finally, tonight, on our way back from a business trip we stopped. We were starving. 
The bar was pretty full but on the restaurant side there were only two tables that had diners. That made me a bit worried. 
We were given menus and our drink orders were taken. They scored big points for having a craft beer that my husband had not tried. The menu was extensive and I was starving so I asked the waitress for suggestions. I took her advice and ordered the Pappardelle and Fillet Meatballs. I ordered a house salad to go with it. My husband ordered the Cheeseboard and a Grilled Beet salad. 
Our salads came first. My husband LOVED the beet salad. It had pieces of fresh orange as well as a basalmic dressing. I think he would have licked the bowl if I would have let him. My house salad had no iceberg lettuce in sight. Instead it had a Spring mix with tomatoes, purple onions, cucumbers, and some freshly made croutons. The Bleu cheese dressing was house made and delicious. We were served warm bread with a plate of seasonings and olive oil to dip the bread in. 
Once we finished our salads our enters came. Holy Cow was mine delicious!  The meatball was full of flavor, the pasta cooked perfectly, and the sauce made you want to slap your mama. (I'm from the south and that's a huge compliment). To put the dish over the top was the pieces of goat cheese that were sprinkled over it. The perfect bite was a little bit if each. I barely made it through half my dish before I was full. Hooray for doggy bags!
My husband's Cheese Board came with Prosciutto, Sopressata, Kalamata olives, four or five cheeses, a honey Dijon dipping sauce and sesame crackers. He even took home a doggy bag. 
I'm so glad that I finally had the chance to eat here. I found out that they have a location in Canonsburg. I'll be trying that location SOON!"}
{"text":"Super good lunch. Reuben sandwich, cole slaw and Caesar salad for 2 under 20. The bathrooms can use some work,but the waitstaff was very competent.   The Table has a lunch menu 2 for 15 which makes a great lunch. We would definitely go back again. Seating at the bar, at high top tables around the bar and at tables and booths in a separate fining room. Better food than many laces we have been lately"}
