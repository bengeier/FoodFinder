{"text":"Its actually worse than it sounds in Bill P.'s review. If you're starving, park here and walk over to the Giant Eagle right there - anything in their cafe will be better."}
{"text":"The menu sucks here. I have fond memories of coming to eat n park, but they have changed the menu significantly and it blows now."}
{"text":"My husband and I flew to Pittsburg and our flight landed at 2 am and we were starving. Thank goodness this place was open. We got everything we ordered and we were happily fed. Considering we were one of two tables we got great service. The staff was pleasant and happy to have us!  You can't really screw up eggs."}
{"text":"If I could leave no stars I would.  They won't even answer their phone for takeout.  I called three times and was hung up on. 
Keep up the good work, Edgewood!"}
{"text":"This review is really for their drive thru service.  I had called my order in while I was in the plaza at another store.  Giving me ample time to finish what I was doing and then head over there before I headed for home.

Never using the drive thru here before I was a bit leery when I used the drive thru lane.  It's quite narrow and hard to maneuver through.  Especially since it runs between the building and trash area.

The food, even though it took me five minutes to get home, was nearly cooled the whole way through.  I know I could have heated it up in the microwave, but I kind of expected it to be at least lukewarm.  This made me think that the twenty minute wait I was to have was an over estimation.

Not even the tiny smiley cookie they gave me could make up for the lackluster meal I received."}
{"text":"Best breakfast foods ever. Try the caramel apple pancakes with nuts and caramel drizzle for something sweet and different from your usual boring bacon and eggs! They also have a wide variety of regular lunch and dinner specials, all of which are delicious!"}
{"text":"The hostess seemed annoyed that she had to seat customers, but it's nothing personal, she acted like that with everyone. Our waitress eventually came over and apologized for chatting with the next table for so long while we were waiting, but awkwardly added that we were chatting too. Which is true, we were chatting. Remember, unfold your napkin and place it in your lap, keep your elbows off the table, and sit in silence while you read the menu.

We were already parked, so we ate. You know what Eat 'n Park food is like, probably. You pay at the register. The same employee who seated us was working the register. She still seemed annoyed, but it's hard to tell when someone never makes eye contact or speaks directly to you, so I don't want to complain."}
{"text":"danny, what do you want for breakfast?\"

how hard is it to make bacon and god damn eggs!  piss!  shit!!"}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten here since March, when I wrote my last one-star review.

I had hoped that half a year would change things for the better at this location (after all, it was still in business) but I was wrong.

Here's a blow-by-blow:

My party and I walked in and waited by the podium. No one was manning it, and no one was in line- the restaurant wasn't even busy. About five minutes later, someone finally noticed us, came over, and seated us.

After we had been sitting for close to ten minutes, a waitress finally stopped by and took our drink orders.

Ten minutes later, the waitress walked by again, still without our drinks. She stopped short, looked over at us, said \"Oops,\" and scurried away. Another two minutes later, she came back with the drinks (apologizing that she had forgotten about us) and took our food orders.

The food was basic breakfast stuff, but it took nearly 30 minutes for it to come out of the kitchen. That's not too bad of a delay in and of itself, but on top of the long delays we'd had so far, it was aggravating.

The food wasn't as plainly BAD as I remember it being half a year ago, but there was one major error:

I ordered a vegetarian omelet, but there was a chunk of bacon in it. Not a whole strip or anything, but a segment about a half-inch long that was clearly bacon. I guess it got mixed into my food on the grill by accident, left over from a previous order or something. Luckily, I'm not Jewish/Muslim/etc, so I didn't have any religious reasons to exclude the pork from my diet, but frankly, the restaurant dodged a bullet there, mixing pork into a dish that was explicitly listed as vegetarian. You'd think a restaurant would know how much of a Big Deal it is to be careful to keep pork out of non-pork dishes, especially considering that Pittsburgh has an enormous Jewish community.

All in all, it took us about an hour just to get a simple breakfast, and the service (both tableside and in the kitchen) was clearly awful. Again, the restaurant wasn't even crowded... There's simply no excuse for providing service that bad.

ADDENDUM: January 1st, 2011

I was talking to my father, and he mentioned that he had stopped in at this Eat 'n Park for breakfast a few weeks ago on his way to work. He said he couldn't believe how bad it was. I agreed and told him that I'd only gone to this location twice in 2010, and it was terrible both times, so I'd decided not to go back."}
{"text":"I've been there a couple times and didn't have an experience quite as bad as the other two reviewers. Was I lucky?"}
