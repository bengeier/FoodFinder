{"text":"Good and Fresh food, very bad service and manner.  I always go to this shop to buy Vietnamese food, sweets and fried pork cake.They have fresh summer role only in the weekend. All of their food is fresh and really delicious!!! 5 Star for the quality of their food.  The shop also got the bad part which makes me stay away from it. I haven't go back to shop there for a while.  I was born and raise in Southeast Asia the food that I used to is really similar to the one they have here. There is no obvious problem for me to just pick the food up and pay for them at the cashier.   When I go their really often lately on the weekend and weekday, I often overlooked or even cut the queue by Vietnamese speaking people who talk to the merchant and cut the line. The cashier doesn't care about it until I say that I come before they say sorry. This happen for at least 2-3 times in a row only this month.  The second thing is that when I ask the owner about their extra food or the relationship with the shop with the same name in Seattle. The woman behind the counter is obviously ignored me and put the younger lady who only say that they accept only cash for payment not credit or debit!!! It prove that they barely understand English or even care about customer outside their ethnic group who cannot speak their language (I can read it from their face).   However, My comment will probably not effect their business since the majority customer is their own kind who always cut the line of people from outside their ethnic group.  If you want to experience the shop, you should educated yourself about Vietnamese food a little bit. So that the only thing you have to do is to pick and pay... 1 for service mind and employee manner."}
{"text":"I have been here many times already, never had a chance to write a review on this place.   This is the adult version of wonderland, well for me anyways.  I could eat anything and everything in here.   The cha chien is probably the best in town, for $5 you get the size of a pizza slice and as thick as a burger.    The desserts are the best in town as well.  The variety they have makes me very happy.  When you look at the selection, you just want one of everything.   They also have one of the best and cheapest  tofu fa here.   Everything in here is decently priced and very well prepared.  Just an awesome place for authentic Vietnamese food (snack wise, not dishes) and desserts.  Will i come back... i want to put my bed in here."}
{"text":"I used to come here very often with my husband and my parents but I don't go there anymore. the tofu is not as good as before;  sweet dessert are okay. the only one best would be pandan soya milk."}
{"text":"Good place to grab flavoured Tofu. They only accept cash. They also offer cane juice."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a month.  We drive about 1.5 hours to get here.  I usually spend $90-$125 each time I am here.   The cashier always tries to give me something for free.  Some desert of which I did not purchase etc.  If I don't buy it, I don't eat it so it is useless to me.   Today, I spent over $120 and she tried to give me a container of day old tofu.  It was in the fridge.  I never buy the tofu.  It is supposed to be hot and that is how you sale that type of tofu.   To me if you want to give me something, why not give me one of the things I bought free of charge.  Why give me something I have no interest in????  If you want to get rid of it, throw it into the garbage.  I am not a garbage can!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It is a slap in my face when you do that.  Please do not do it!!!!! Next time if I walk into the store and it is empty except me and all the people were doing things and didn't even serve me, I will walk out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Will stop by here everytime I go to Mississauga Chinatown. Fresh batches of fried tofu continuously come out along with the Viet fish cake (cha ca).  They also have regular or pandan tofu pudding (???) and have a wide variety of colourful desserts and drinks."}
{"text":"THE HEAVEN OF VIETNAMESE FOOD! This is the place to go if you're looking for a vast variety of Vietnamese foods, I come here almost every sunday (though I'm biased because I'm vietnamese) and I get something different every time! The food here is very fresh, and the quality is top-notch.  A one star deduction due to poor layout or enforcements of service.  You will get line cutters a lot of the time, and I do see a bit of favouritism of Vietnamese customers.  If you don't speak Vietnamese, try to pick the younger ones, as they do understand english better.  Looking forward to coming here again! :)"}
{"text":"They have be thui (roasted veal served rare). That alone warrants the 4 stars. It's only available on weekends but go Friday to be safe. I went Friday at 5pm and saw only 10 portions. $14 per box serves around 4 ppl. If you're a pig like me, then it's enough for 2 ppl. Their iced coffee was delicious. Better than Second Cup's iced coffee!!! They carry de xao lan and tiet canh vit on weekends too. Saw only 5 boxes of tiet canh though so arrive early!"}
{"text":"This little Vietnamese place, does not deserve to be so tucked away! Your one stop shop for (almost) all your vietnamese salty & sweet goodies.  It's a very 'no-thrills' atmosphere - but the quality of the food and drinks, take it.  My staple is their fresh, in-house made, soy milk and the silk tofu dessert! Don't leave without it! In the fridge, you`ll find jugs of soy milk - pandan flavoured, regular, and unsweeten. AND TRY THE TOFU DESSERT. Silky smooth, and so good.  You`ll also find a variety of desserts, ready-packaged appetizers like banh cuon (steamed rice rolls), to fresh fried tofu! The food is constantly being made fresh and topped off. If you come by during peak hours (late morning - mid noon),  you`ll find there is always a line.   Organization here is TERRIBLE. Don't expect anyone to actually follow the line. Especially on the weekends, there's usually a staff member at each station - the cash, dessert area, fried goods. Customers will go up to any one of them, place their order, and go over to cash.  Every visit, there's multiple transactions going on, even they end up confused. Stand your ground, and politely nudge your way through.  Customer service, like mentioned in other reviews, isn't exemplary. It's a very 'pop-in, pop-out', no expectations environment. But for the quality of the food, I remain a fan.  Go get a jug of soy milk, or two!"}
{"text":"I gave 1 star to this place as I have had bad experiences for so many times. Their products are fine, only problem is the mess of customers not get into the line, always make their purchase/ request right in front of the cashier counter, no one look at the people who are waiting at the line, just get what they wanted and chat with staffs. All the staffs are not helpful at all, they saw me and other customers who next to me, but they said nothing and without any eye contact, didn't serve us on sequences, made this wait much longer."}
{"text":"Horrible service and disorganized. I haven't found a single stable item to love. Also, how did they manage to screw up the main attraction, a.k.a (soft and fried) tofu? This place is in need a serious \"fix me up\" work."}
{"text":"Quality Cha Ca (Deep Fried Fish cakes) !! have gone here for years, excellent vietnamese dessert selection, and price is just right. Fresh sweet sticky rice and I really like their spring rolls as well and the tofu is yummmmmm, I don't even like tofu so that says a lot."}
{"text":"I am conflicted about how to rate this place. The tofu is delicious but I felt that the customer service I received was terrible.   On my recent visit, my mom and I wanted to buy some fried tofu. We were standing there for some time before we were served. When we were finally served, the older woman who served us (I think she's the owner's wife) was unsmiling and she made us feel like we were an inconvenience to her.   On a previous visit my mom was given some broken pieces of tofu and when she asked if she could have some unbroken pieces instead (there were lots of whole pieces left), the older man (who I'm pretty sure is the owner) who was standing near the employee who was serving my mom said that the broken pieces are the same as the whole pieces.    I was not too happy about the service. However, I did enjoy the tofu.  They have several types of fried tofu. I tried the lemongrass chili fried tofu (3 pieces for $1) and the onion, vermicelli and mushroom fried tofu (5 pieces for $1). The lemongrass chili tofu pieces are bigger than the onion, vermicelli and mushroom ones. They are both delicious. The outside is crispy and the inside is soft and chewy. Not spongy tasting at all. The tofu pieces are very flavorful and they smell divine. You can really taste the individual flavors mixed into the tofu.  FYI: There is a sign that says that the minimum order allowed for tofu purchases is $2.  As good as the tofu is, I will not return because of the service."}
{"text":"Skip this place if you can't speak their language. We waited in line to pay and they kept helping other customers who purchased fried tofu regardless if they were in front or behind us in line. We stood at the cash register. When we told them we waited a long time after the lady behind us was cashed out, one lady said she knows and another said \"you have to tell me\". If a customer is in front of the register and you still need to be told they want to be cashed out, you need to reconsider your service standards. We walked out without buying anything."}
{"text":"Really good xoi khuc! Had the chicken one.  Nice mix of rice and mung bean.  Great for Vietnamese snack foods and desserts."}
{"text":"Nestled in Mississauga chinatown, this place has an extensive list of stuff.  The only problem is that I don't speak vietnamese and some of the descriptions aren't clear.  The fried tofu is very popular but I remember it being tasteless.  The presentation and display of the product looks great.  My only qualm is that they are not fluent in english and they don't speak cantonese.   This place is really busy on saturdays when I've gone.  You have to joustle your way around the place.  This is one of the few places that offers pandan flavoured tofu pudding (Tao foo fa) but we prefer the original."}
{"text":"I tried to go here, but they decided to close 45 mins earlier. I don't care, but that's not how you do business."}
{"text":"this place is very terrible!!! they serve rotten Vietnamese subs. i went with my brother to buy some and when we took a bite, the meat was rotten and we had to throw it out. i will not come back again. highly not recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Food isn't the best, but I think the selling point of this place is its convenience aimed towards Vietnamese culinary.  Great selections of desserts, drinks, and tofu.  They also have fresh soy milk which is a plus.  Like I said before, the food isn't the best but it's nice to have a place to stop by in case you don't have any food at home.  Prices are also pretty decent.   My only gripe with this place is that it's always busy and the lines/ordering system is very disorganized.  Also, there's a noticeable bias towards older Vietnamese people who often cut the line.  If you do not know Vietnamese, be prepared to experience a language barrier as well.  However, since this is a take-out place, service didn't really dismay me from my star rating."}
{"text":"I make a trip here ever so often for the Vietnamese ham cause my loves the taste. However, I totally dislike the lack of organization and customer service provided.   Place is super busy on the weekends since there are more variety of goods. I have been there on a weekday and at least 2 hours before closing time but they stop making certain items even their basic items. It annoying when you drive 45 minutes to get there to find out they will not be making anymore even though it's 2 hours to closing time.  On the weekends, the food get replenished quickly but the store is chaos. And not the organized chaos type. They also have reduced the portion of food by using smaller container. When asked about the container size, immediately met with the rolling eyes and glaring by the staff.  I do understand that you have to work with the economy and inflation of food items. Rather than raising their prices they chose to reduce portion size. It's obvious so why would you get so defensive about a question. Very disappointed that they do not care about customer satisfaction.  Happens often to business that has taken off."}
