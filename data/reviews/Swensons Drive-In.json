{"text":"The galley boy is hands down my favorite burger. Anywhere. The service at Swensons is always awesome. The car hops hustle in all weather conditions, and they are always super nice. I tend to tip %100 because I am so impressed with the service I receive."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers i have ever had. LeBron James LOVES this place and I must admit I tried it because he recommended it or at least he raved about it. I am an instant fan."}
{"text":"Just ate at swensons for the first time. Outstanding! Galley boy is delicious, service was great (we had zack, he is the bomb) we are taking a couple sandwiches for later :) loved it!"}
{"text":"We usually have a great experience at Swensons, but today was not the case. We ordered and said it was a 'to go' order. Everything went fine with ordering. Here's where the disappointment came in: The guy that took our order gave us the food and said that he would be back for to collect payment. After a couple of minutes have passed, he returns and takes the bank card. We timed how long it would take and waited for his return for a little over 5 minutes. Never showed - thought he ran out the back door and booked a trip to France (lol). I turned on my lights and waited until another server came running up to the car. I told him want happened and he said he would fine our server and speed things up. When our server STOPPED running around the parking lot - he went into the building (hopefully to speed things up), then came out dropping off orders to people that showed up wayyyyyyy later then when we first arrived. He went back into the building picked and came out with 2 more orders for someone else and then handed us the bill and card. After telling me repeatedly where to sign and trying to get me to hurry it up without looking at the bill before I signed - I promptly told him 'I know where to sign, but I'm going to look it over'. After all looking a bill over before you sign is not only responsible, but only takes a couple of seconds which is less time it took to receive my bill and gets my card back from him. It took a total of 7 minutes from when I gave him my card to run through the  machine and to get it back. Yup, that tip was zero. Plus, when we finally got home the food was cold and needed to be heated up and the fries were soggy from sitting in the bag so long that condensation built up. Not to mention that the toppings on the two sandwiches was reversed and messed up. So, out of the 177 positive reviews - this reviewer is at least telling it like it is."}
{"text":"I came here at midnight when I was already too full, only because both a good friend as well as my cousin who lives in Ohio convinced me that the burgers were really really good. I have to say I was pretty satisfied with the galley boy. The meat is pretty juicy (you get two patties) and they have this special sauce that is kind of reminiscent of cole slaw..in any case the burger is a-ok, except for the fact that I feel like my arteries are being clogged instantly. The fries are also really crisp and delicious. 

If you want to try an interesting food experience, get the fried mushrooms. 

I would give this place 3 stars for the taste, but I will give it 4 because they have such a cool serving model. You drive up, and the waiter comes running (RUNNING) to take your order. Then they return to your car with your food and a little tray to put on your window so *you don't even have to get out of the car* I'd feel bad for these guys on cold nights but the summer is perfect for this kind of thing.

IS IT CHEAP? Yes! The galley boy is around $3.15 I think, and the other sides, like fries or fried zucchini/mushrooms/etc, are about $2."}
{"text":"Great burgers and quick service. Shakes, malts and mushrooms are awesome as well! I would suggest going with at least a double burger since the patties are a little thin and you get more flavor with more patties."}
{"text":"Best cheeseburgers anywhere!! Best onion rings around too! Their milkshakes are also delicious. One of my favorite places to go for food :)"}
{"text":"I've only had Swensons twice so I cannot say that I'm a regular (as many of my friends are). However, it is so goddarn delicious that I cannot help but write a review about the place.

Swensons is situated in the Akron area, and only in the Akron area, which is highly unfortunate to those who are from far away. It is a drive in diner, which is highly rare these days. As a customer, you park into a parking spot and flip on your headlights. A college/high school kid will come running to give you a menu or take your order. The food is fresh and hot, and most likely cooked to order. In my experiences, I ordered a Galley boy, which is their most popular burger. Now, I must say that the Galley boy is not similar to most hamburgers. It consists mostly of a burger, bun, white cheese, and some kind of special sauce (barbeque maybe). It may not look like the best burger, but one bite and I was hooked. They were delicious. Of course, the burger is not whopping in size, so I ordered two, along with a Dr. Pepper and fries. Service came when you wanted it to (again, just a flip of the lights), and it was unusually comfortable being catered to while sitting in the car. 

I don't think you can go wrong with Swensons."}
{"text":"When I return to my childhood hometown, Swensons is always at the top of my list for a visit or two! 

I have lived in New York City (Manhattan) since college graduation (30+ years) and there is nothing that compares to the excellence of a Swenson's cheeseburger, stuffed mushrooms, onion rings and chocolate shake - and the ambiance of eating it all in the car."}
{"text":"lived in Cleveland for 3 years, disliked much of my time there but once every few months I would make the drive from downtown to Swensons and get a few cheeseburgers. they're tasty, cheap and fit the feel of the place perfectly!

i think there's some cinnamon in the meat or something?  its different and in a great way!

loved eating at Swensons!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a trip to Swensons! I love the galley boy, potato teasers, and a chocolate shake. This latest visit the server recommended the seasonal blueberry shake which did not disappoint. Service is fast (they do run to and from the cars, after all) and the prices are reasonable. A NE Ohio gem that I visit whenever I am in town!"}
{"text":"Love it! My boyfriend brought me here for one of our first dates and we are visiting again today. Cannot say it enough, we love it here! I am vegan and he's vegetarian and there's actually food for us here! This is the only \"fast foody\" ish place we will come to. The service is amazing, and everyone is so friendly. Go visit! (Dude with the man bun is so cool!)"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Swensons!? Everything on the menu tastes great. They get your order out to you very quickly and the wait staff are always friendly."}
{"text":"The Galleyboy is delicious, but it is the only burger from Swensons that is any good. Also, one is not enough to fill you up."}
{"text":"Awesome food, excellent service, great prices. Try Galley Boy burger, fish sandwich, and vanilla shake. Shake was thick and delish!"}
{"text":"Kids love this place but I think it is because the servers hustle and live what they do.  I do like the food and hey do a good job. Always tip well but not sure why they since it is really served once and u go home 

Recommend for a one time experience anytime and also for the food"}
{"text":"Went to Swenson's for the first time.  Can't figure out what everyone is raving about.  $3.10 for six lousy onion rings.  Better french fries at McDonalds.  We ordered a Galley Boy and a Quarter Pounder plus burger.  Nothing special and at $3.35 each overpriced.  Only good thing was the chocolate shake.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Simply put, Swenson's cheeseburgers are the measuring stick for all other burgers.  So far, none can compare.  I would take a Swenson's double cheeseburger any day over a $30 kobe beef gourmet burger in a hoity-toity upscale restaurant.  It's simple, elegant, the meat has the most incredible (and mysterious) flavor, the buns are perfection, and the melted velveeta cheese is dynamite.  Do yourself a favor and try one if for some reason you never have.  Oh, and don't forget an order of the potato teasers and a mint whip (a most curiously delicious & light \"milkshake\" thing) while you're there!

Oh and if the weather is bad do the hardworking runners a favor and pull in close to the building under the awning - don't make them run around in the cold rain/snow!"}
{"text":"I'm generally not a fan of fast food, but Swenson's is different.  They make outstanding burgers, hot dogs, onion rings, etc.  In the 20-ish years that I lived in Ohio, there were only a few entre√©s I tried because their burgers are so delicious that I almost always would order those rather than anything else.  Their vanilla milkshakes are the best I've ever had.  One of the many restaurants I miss from when we lived in NE Ohio."}
{"text":"swensons... it's in my blood!  it's an ohio thing and i am so thankful for that!  thank you swensons for consistantly great service, food, value and tradition for as long as i can remember.  i couldn't care less about a burger at any other place than swensons.  it is just done with such flare (there has to be brown sugar in there), toasted and buttered bun and totally unique sauces.  such a treat!  nothing makes me happier than taking someone there for the first time and seeing their face as they take the first bite.  
is it me or have the prices just always stayed the same?  
at any cost, this place is a treat.
favorites are of course the galley boy, it is a must have.  cheeseburgers with everything, fried zucchini sticks and mushrooms and what is it with that grilled cheese sandwich?  i cannot figure out what makes it so great.  try it with a slice of tomato inside and in the winter with a bowl of tomato soup.  chili dogs are yummy with cheese and little diced onions and they must have a million milkshake flavors.  go for a peanut butter and banana or a pumpkin and butterscotch.  
and if you have kids, watch them smile when you tell them they get to eat in the car!"}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers you'll ever have you're missing out if you don't try it shakes are also very good order Swensons"}
{"text":"My wife had a cheeseburger with lettuce and tomato. Both The burger and bun were cold. A had a double cheeseburger the bun was warm but the burger was cold and dry. Both of our buns were smashed.  I don't know why folks are so thrilled with this place"}
{"text":"Swensons is a decent burger drive in, but it didn't live up to the hype in my opinion. This location is on 59 in Stow right near the Kent line. One of the perks is you never have to get out of your car for anything. You drive in, park, turn on your lights, and you have service. Your waiter/waitress will bring you a menu and whenever you want to order, you turn your lights on. Another nice thing about this place is that it's dirt cheap. We paid $10 for three people! Now on to the food. I had a cheeseburger with everything, or mustard, pickles, and onions, and fries. I'm not saying I disliked the food, but at the same time, I didn't love it. The fries were good, but nothing special. Same with the burger. It was good, but I'm not rushing back to it. In my opinion, it was just too much like your average fast food burger. Personally, I'd rather get a burger from Five Guys or In'n'Out when I'm out west. Overall, Swensons is a fun experience due to the drive in, but the food just didn't do much for me."}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers anywhere.  The galley boy with its two special sauces is one of my favorite meals anywhere, as well as the double \"with everything\", which means mustard, pickles, and onions.  Go for the potato teezers on the side, kinda like cheesy hash browns with a little jalapeno bite.  The shakes are also delicious, have to recommend the hot fudge-banana combo.  An Akron landmark."}
{"text":"Best burger in Cleveland. Oh, and the shake as well is amazing."}
{"text":"I am surprised that out of all the places I've eaten, this is one of the few places way out of my way that I really want to go back to.

When you pull into the place, it seems weird as it does not seem to have a drive thru window. Instead you park your car in a lot that has a small building in the middle. Once you've parked a guy will literally run out to your car to get your order. 

I had the burger, onion rings and a chocolate shake. the burger was one of those thin burgers that probably started out as a ball of fresh raw meat that was flattened on the grill. It came on a toasted bun. What made the burger so interesting was the thin slice of raw onion on it. You would think this is not a big deal but this made the burger taste so much better. Almost like those burgers or sandwiches that mom used to make at home. The onion rings were obviously home made as each ring was of a different size. The shake had a very fresh taste to it. 

I was suspicious about all the 5 stars ratings but now I am no longer."}
{"text":"I live in Nevada and this is the first place I visit when I come to the Cleveland area.  It can't be beat.  Truly as good as it gets.  Skip the condiments, skip the special sauce, skip everything except for the burger, bun and cheese.  OMG.  I can't speak much to the sides or the shakes or anything else.  For me, this place is just about the cheeseburgers, plain.  Try it, you will certainly like it!"}
{"text":"Always amazing the staff is amazing it's the best burger ever.  If I moved out of Ohio I will always miss and crave a galley boy. I love it."}
{"text":"Swenson's has the best fast food burger I have ever had. The Galley Boy is a flavor fiesta in your mouth which I imagine gives a high similar to hard drugs.  Actually, there very well may be cocaine in the burgers because after I have one I experience pure ecstasy. Or is that X? Drug lingo aside, the Galley Boy is the shit. With its two secret sauces melding magically in a myriad of masterful ways. 

My order every single time.

2 Galley Boys
Onion Rings
California (a Grape drink)

No joke. I quite literally took a road trip up to Akron from Columbus while I was in college for the Sole Purpose of getting Swenson's burgers. It really is that good!"}
{"text":"Always delicious burgers and shakes. My son loves the hot dogs too. Staple food in Stow. Get the galley boy and enjoy"}
{"text":"There is no place like this on the entire face of this planet. I wish they would expand because they would grow business so much. The California, double cheeseburger and two orders of the potato teasers is my staple order. This is what I miss about college, going here all the time and indulging. I dont eat fast food now due to diet changes but if I lived near Swensons, it would be trouble. I am forever a fan for life!"}
{"text":"I'm from Ohio and I just went home for a visit.  I was there for 5 days and got swensons 5 times. And I don't really eat meat or fried food ever. Swenson's is the absolute best!!!"}
{"text":"Great little burgers. With tater tots and a chocolate phosphate these are hard to beat. The car hops are nice and friendly too. Always a treat to come here."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for our meal (take-out) while postponing an appt at 3pm and food never arrived. We had to leave without food or eating due to being even later for the already postponed appointment. Poor, poor service. Never experienced this before while eating here. Never again."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries love the chili it's actually really good I like to dip my fries or burger in it lol know the main cook there he's great does a good job very clean good customer service! Oh and their ice cream is quite tasty!!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Give me a triple cheeseburger with the works (mustard, pickle, onion) and a chocolate phosphate."}
{"text":"I went to swensons for the first time today. I was looking forward to tasting their burger after hearing a couple of people rave about it. Sad to say, i was underwhelmed. The beef patties were bland and there was too much sauce. I enjoyed the potato teezers, though, and their pumpkin shake was really good. Other than those items, I think i'll stick with five guys for my burger fix. ( better yet, can the powers that be please open an In n Out here in NE Ohio?)"}
{"text":"We grew up in Akron and now live in Cleveland. One of the things we missed is having a Swensons around the corner. With this opening on the east side of Cleveland we are pumped! Went for the first time today and it didn't disappoint: great potato teasers and potato puffs (for those who have never been here, fries aren't the greatest), solid milkshakes and one of the best burgers in the country! They are up and running with a quick and efficient staff as well. Well done Swensons!"}
{"text":"tbh i don't understand why there isn't a Swensons in Columbus, watching the servers sprint to get your food is hilarious and the food is super cheap too. The galley boy is well worth the $3.90 and the milkshake is mediocre but honestly watching the servers run earned the 5 star from me. Will be back whenever I come visit Kent"}
{"text":"The best burgers pretty much anywhere for a great price! The galley boy is to die for!"}
{"text":"Great service! Delicious food! This was our first time here passing by and we enjoyed it! Quality food for take out and the steak was delicious! The choice of different flavors for milkshakes is fantastic! Def one of my first choices if heading for some take out food! Great knowing our first time was here at one of the first places this chain opened up at! Here, you pull up in your car, flick your lights on and the waiters come running to your car to take your order and you have the choice between eating in your car with a tray or take away, I was surprised a place like this existed. Great job to the boys who run around serving, for their quick service and never to be seen walking when taking orders! Keep up the great work! :) proud to see young people with this work ethic!"}
{"text":"Something is addictive about the slight sweetness of their burgers and the gooey velveeta  cheese; it's just amazing!! And everything is cooked to order so the food is always fresh, unlike most fast food. And sitting in your car takes me back to being a kid, going to A&W Root beer drive ins."}
{"text":"Maybe the hype is from those who have not experienced food with taste that is not covered in nasty sauce. Yuck. just plain yuck. Soggy fries, tiny burger patties, crusty buns. I will never subject my colon to this abuse again."}
{"text":"I was raised on Swensons as was my father before me.  His father before him was raised on brisket, but that's besides the point.  

I can say the Swensons has the best fried burgers in Akron and perhaps all of Ohio.  I say fried because these are not thick, beefy, pink-in-the-middle patties, but the burgers of the fast food eateries of yore.

If you're not familiar with the small Swenson chain be aware that they are drive-ins, meaning that you sit in your car and the staff comes to you as alerted by your headlights ablaze.  Naturally this system has caused some confusion in these days of daytime running lights.  But the service does not wane.

A double cheeseburger, fries, and a california to drink.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Unbelievable.  If you are from NE Ohio, you already know, so no need to read, actually, you shouldn't even be referencing Yelp for this particular type of food, becuase there is no better option.  Great service, great variety, and absolute best quality product.  Although I've just begun to expand my menu selection, I have yet to have a disappointing meal here.  Everything is delicious.  I have been frequenting Swenson's for over 20 years and I see no end in sight.  Keep up the perfection!  3 great recommendations, often overlooked: chocolate-banana milkshake, fried chicken sandwich (to die for), and the most underrated (commonly unknown, because it's not specified on the menu) Well done Cajun Fries; hated the regular fries for years until I found out about this little piece of heaven. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wow, first time at Swensons today. And I must say what have I been missing. Fantastic burgers, awesome service."}
{"text":"There is nothing bad on the menu. I turned my six year-old on to the rootbeer float and
he's now ready for a 12 step program... they're that good... and if you order to-go - they package the ice cream & root beer separately. I normally don't like sauce on my burger but the Galley Boy rocks!"}
{"text":"Let me start this review off by saying Swenson's definitely isn't the place for everyone. If you can't stand great service, quick, delicious burgers, tasty sides, or perfect milkshakes, then stay away from Swenson's. If, on the other hand, you're like me and all of these things are what you look for in a restaurant, then Swenson's is the place for you! I usually get a single \"hamburg\", a side order of onion rings, and a chocolate milkshake, and it's a combo you can't go wrong with. I have nothing but positive things to say about this place."}
{"text":"If you don't have Swensons in your life, you are missing out! Love the burgers and the milkshakes! Chocolate malt is my favorite. I've had the egg salad, potato teasers, mushrooms, and onion rings and love them all! Service is quick and always with a friendly face!"}
{"text":"An Akron classic. From here or not, you will most likely love it! You can never go wrong with their award-winning Galley Boy- I'm usually picky when it comes to burgers but I love this burger! They have an array of different milkshake flavors- all of which are superb as well. Overall, if you're looking for a classic burger and milkshake meal, I recommend Swenson's!"}
{"text":"Yummy fast food. Inexpensive. Quick service. Shakes are fantastic. Old school drive-in."}
{"text":"sooo good! friendly good service! love the burgers and the potato puff with ranch just hate when the ranch gets put in the bag with the food and gets hot! milkshakes are delish!"}
{"text":"This is the only Swenson's I've been to. To start off, I like some of the sides, onion rings,fried zucchini,potatoe puffs & teasers, & fried mushrooms. The galley Boy is a tasty burger but . . . they have a real problem cooking burgers here! ! ! I've had too many dry GBBs here. Under cooked too. Tried a 1/4 lber once,it was really dry. Got a triple cheeseburger to go, the middle patty was rare. I like the Galley Boy but getting a good one is too hard for me. I've quit going. I went after work a lot 3pm ish & after dinner time . Perhaps slow timers are bad times here?"}
{"text":"Swenson's is my favorite fast food restaurant in Ohio, and possibly the U.S. What do I order each time? The Galley Boy, of course! It is perfection. Two juicy, flavorful beef patties, perfectly melted cheese, buttery buns, and their special sauce. This sandwich represents a true marriage of meat, cheese, sauce, and bread- all of these ingredients become one. They also have fun sides and awesome shakes and malts - I love the hot fudge peanut butter shake."}
{"text":"As you drive down Main St USA, you look to your right.  You see a McDonald's with their Big Mac.  Look to your left and you see a Burger King with their Whopper.  Down the street and around the corner is a Wendy's with their Chicken Nuggets and Triple Double Classic.  Sonic is turning out dog meat on a bun, and you are not satisfied with your choices.

Once you get to the end of the street you see a different kind of place.  A place where the marketing machine of Madison Ave hasn't touched it.  It is a piece of Americana, all but extinct except for our part of town.  Our Cleveland.

Swenson's is as good as it is nostalgic.  A simple Drive-In joint.  Take away the catchy jingles about ingredients, the stupid crown, and Dave Thomas and you find an authentic hamburger.  It will not have you thinking where is the beef.  It will have you thinking, where is my pen so I can write a thank-you note to the car hop who ran to your car to make sure you got prompt service.

I say flock to this place, get a Galley Boy and a chocolate shake."}
{"text":"It's as good as any other Swenson's. The food is delicious. The service is fast and excellent (they full on sprint to your car). A NEO staple. If you've never had Swenson's, you do not know what a hamburger is. My go to is a Galley Boy and a cherry milkshake."}
{"text":"This is a real Drive In!! Not that silly Sonic imitation. The food is delicious and the service is fast and friendly even in the pouring rain! I will be back"}
{"text":"This place is great until you have an issue. I picked up lunch for two of us back at the office. I find that my sandwich has onion and no tomato so I called. Dave...the mgr was hesitant but took my name and said i could return for a free sandwich another time. After i called him i found out my coworker had the wrong sandwich so i called back. Dave pretty much said it was the way i asked for the cajun ckn and that there are many chkn sandwiches. He was unwilling to fix this issue. I proceeded to the Swenson.com webstie and typed a complaint there. I received a call back from the same useless mgr which i thought was completely ridiculous. Why would i want to talk to someone who was disrespectful TWICE....the corp office should have just offered to buy us a new lunch another time! Seriously WHO BLAMES THE CUSTOMER?! I like Swensons, but these places keep abusing us over and over! Enough it enough! It now like the sandwiches are .99! The bill was almost 16.00 for lunch at a drive-in! cmon! We deserve to get what we ordered and get it correctly! LAME"}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best hamburger I have ever had! Blows out Michael Symon, In and Out, Five Guys, etc. My only complaint is their fries suck but it doesn't matter because I always get their potato teasers! Service is top of the line also!"}
{"text":"A California and a galley boy ... You simply can't go wrong with these at this Akron staple. This was one of the first restaurants I would hit up when I was away for college and grad school as soon as I came back into town. Whether you're looking for a small snack or a meal, Swensons is the place to go, and it will never disappoint."}
{"text":"I love Swenson's.  The menu is certainly not healthy, but well worth a trip if you are in NE Ohio.  Between the experience of a drive in restaurant, the unique menu (get a galley boy burger!), and a small town feel, Swenson's is one of my favorite spots to go out for a treat with my friends."}
{"text":"Swensons has the BEST food! I have been going to Swenson since back in the day. Favorite thing to order Potato Teasers with Ranch and dont forget a Cheeseburger with Everything."}
{"text":"Holy mother of God.

I haven't had a burger craving this bad since back in my preggo days. We just happened to be around Seven Hills and I knew about this place from you guys.

I was starving and didn't know what to do. Luckily, the server was as patient as he was efficient, and gave us a menu and some time to decide. Like, two minutes.  Haha. We were totally those n00bs who actually had to look at the menu. (It'll remain in our glove compartment for future use.)

My  husband got the galley boy; I would have expected nothing less from him. I got a double cheeseburger with everything. We got two small shakes (key lime for him, chocolate for me) and fries to share.

Well, it was SUPER quick and piping hot when it came out. Such friendly service and cheap to boot!

And oh, my, the burger. I couldn't wait until we got home--hell, I couldn't wait until we pulled out of the parking lot, even though we got the food to go. The only thing I didn't realize ( although on closer inspection of the menu it is pretty clear) that you have to order lettuce and tomato as additional toppings. It's cool, my mustard / cheese whiz amazingness / onion / pickle burger was fabulous. The galley boy was everything it claims to be. The fries were great and tasted fresh, but could have used a touch more salt.

The shake was otherworldly. I think my other top shake in Cleveland is from Tommy's and this might top that. Next time I want to try a combination, possibly involving butterscotch or peanut butter. My husband's key lime shake tasted not only of lime, but also of the creamy filling and rich crust. It was sorta like when Violet eats that dinner gum in Willy Wonka and tastes the whole blueberry pie. Like that.

I expect this will become a treat for us, especially when summer rolls around and we can eat with the windows down."}
{"text":"This place never gets old. My boyfriend had NEVER been so, of course growing up eating Swenson's, I had to take him. My first piece of advice always get a double burger. If you get a single you'll be disappointed you don't have a double. Secondly, you must order a milkshake. It doesn't matter what kind but you have to get one. My favorite is PB and I don't think I've ever ordered another flavor until the BF ordered Banana which was awesome. Lastly, you have to get at least one fried item...well because they are just good- cheezy teasers, onion rings, etc..."}
{"text":"Wow! I got exactly what Kevin suggested. The potato teasers were pretty rich but good. The burger tho, oh my! Not sure I can ever eat another burger again as it won't compare."}
{"text":"Swensons is the best! Hands down one of the best places to eat in Akron if you make your way here. Make sure you definitely stop by and try this."}
{"text":"Just adding another 5 star for this place.  If I ever left the Akron area this is what I would miss the most.  Galley boy, fries, and a 16-ounce California every time I go.  One of the best meals I can think of."}
{"text":"I'm stoked that Clevelanders have the chance to try the amazingness that is Swensons.
I've been hooked my entire life as a former Akron-ite.  
Before the Seven Hills location, I drove my C-town friends down to experience a Galley Boy \"With Everything\", a french fry, and a peanut butter milkshake-- the fave food of my childhood AND adulthood.  

We need to get one in the Cleveland area... Stat!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and the experience was worth it! You pull up and you're immediately approached by a very friendly waiter ready to take your order at your car window. :))) So I ordered the Galley Boy and the potato teezers! My meal arrived hot and fresh! The burger came topped with the infamous olive pinned in the bun and the sauces had the distinct flavor of sweet relish or tartar sauce. It was very tasty, but the star of the show for me was the potato teezers. These tasty potato treats were cooked to perfection with jalape√±os and a tasty cheese dip.  They were just great and a nice compliment to the burger. Big thumbs up to an establishment that sticks with tradition and keeps serving great fast food!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! It's a drive in restaurant and has really great food! And in order for them to take your order look up the menu or go to the side of the restaurant and read the big menu on the wall. And when you are ready to order turn on your car head lights and wait and they will come and take your order. I had the double burger in a basket that came with fires applesauce or coleslaw! It was delicious and I really recommend it. Or get the galley burger in a basket. The staff was friendly. And the restrooms were in the back and they were clean. And their are Swenson's all over NE ohio but it's only a NE ohio thing. If you are traveling through cleveland or Akron you should stop on by and the workers will come up and take you order. You should try it. The burgers are some of the best in ohio. Stop on by! I hope enjoy the restaurant!"}
{"text":"1. Service is disorganized and haphazard. Cars which arrived much later were serviced before us. We had to send our orders back twice due to being incorrect.
2. Once the correct food arrived we weren't disappointed. I've been a patron of the Akron and Independence locations for awhile. It's clear this is new and they need to work out the service kinks"}
{"text":"So good! Classic American drive up and deliver to your car good fatty fare. We ordered fries, onion rings , galley boys and hot dogs- so yummy and super fatty good. My kids decided to also get milkshakes and were as happy as clams.
For those of you who have never been to Swensons, it's the kind of place you go in sweats or Jammie's as you beget leave your car. You simply drive up and the servers run out - literally- to get your orders. Super quick and very Inexpensive . We love it and try to come when we are in Kent ."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place!! I wish they would build one closer to my house in delaware!"}
{"text":"Wow, where do I even start this review?!?!
Instead of trying to come up with something witty, or persuasive let me just be blunt. This is probably the best Cleveland/Akron local chain ever!!!!!!!  The burgers have a sweet taste to them and the cheese is always melting in your mouth. If you don't give Swenson's a try then you are missing out. PS our son loves their grilled cheese and root beer floats!"}
{"text":"This is old school \"thin burgers\" as my son calls them, drive-in style with the order ran (literally) out to your car. My wife and I love the galley boy with grilled onions and the potato poppers with jalape√±o (can't recall the name). Our boys love the cheeseburgers, fries and the rare opportunity to eat in Dad's car. A slice of Americana and one of our favorites for the fam."}
{"text":"Classic popular old fashioned burger joint. On biz for many years. Everything is delish. Very well run business operation with several stores across NE Oh."}
{"text":"Love their shakes and onion rings.  The burgers weren't bad either.  Not gourmet, but quick greasy spoon burgers.  The only thing I didn't like (and is from the clientele) was when I gave a tip to the server, he seemed so surprised and thankful.  That leads me to believe others don't tip here or well and that they should.  The server was great and came with in  a minute or two of my lights going on."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Swensons here in Cleveland . I have had Swensons from Akron and off of the food truck. I really enjoyed both Akron and the food truck . However my experience was at the least bit pleasant I waited over 15 mins to have my order taken then a another 40 mins to get my food.  The galley boy burger was very average. My daughter got the cheeseburger with the Works . She was not able to taste the actual burger . The onion rings were over cooked chewy and rubbery.  Overall not a great experience. However once the dust settles I will give another try . I'll chalk my first experience to being new and crowded."}
{"text":"These burgs are just fantastic. Get the Galley Boy, the quarter pounder or just the little cheeseburg with everything + The potato teezers and honey mustard."}
{"text":"-open late
-friendly service
-pretty darn tasty
-fairly cheap
-locals seem to love it"}
{"text":"Swenson's is some seriously great fast food. Good prices and fast service. Cars pull into spots and turn on their lights to indicate they're ready to place an order. After turning on our lights, a server was over within a couple of minutes tops. The servers are sprinting the entire time. At one point, we heard one of the guys yell, \"let go guys!!!\" for motivation. They're a hard working crew serving up some tasty food. 

We ordered the Galley Boy (a double cheese burger with some kind of sweet BBQ like sauce) and a quarter pounder plus (add whatever toppings you'd like to a quarter pound burger). We also got French fries and potato puffs (aka tater tots) that we're good, but nothing to write home about. All told, we spent all of $12.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Why 5 stars? Because it lived up to the hype.

   ---   ---   ---

Swenson's was another spot that I'd missed out on during my time in Cleveland, which was a pre-Yelping and pre-adventurous time in my life. I routinely ate Chipotle, Hungry Howie's, and Chinese to-go... and that was basically it. Meanwhile, since leaving Cleveland, I've heard the tales of all the amazing places I did not visit, because I was being a silly billy. Swenson's is one of those places.

I was nervous that Swenson's would simply just be a typical fast food joint, and nothing special. But that couldn't be further from the truth.
Swenson's is basically the In-N-Out Burger of NE Ohio. I have no idea what on a Galley Boy that makes it so delicious, but it's crack. Crack that I don't think can ever be duplicated. And despite my aversion to spicy things, the potato teezers were a nice alternative to fries. 

I love the old school drive-in concept. It's like Sonic, but if Sonic were to truly stay authentically retro. They ask you to lower you window just enough to hang your tray on. They bring out the milkshakes with no lid and a skinny straw. Those things my be inconvenient, but they certainly are festive."}
{"text":"A good location on Cedar with Plenty of parkings, nice and quick staff, good service was quick, food was hot (while it was snowing) and tasty. We terrier triple cheese burger, fried chicken filet, fried mushrooms, and onion rings. We liked them all. I loved their peanut butter milkshake! Also their coffee milkshake was nice. Most importantly, good was served you out car and the tray was picked up later on :)"}
{"text":"Hops are attentive and run. Galley Boy is the best burger I have tasted. Shakes are delicious. Love it."}
{"text":"There is a reason that there is a consistent 5 star rating here. THIS PLACE ROCKS! Swensons offers everything that you could want in a drive-in experience. For one the food is delicious. My order consisted of a Gallery Boy (cheeseburger with 2 special sauces), onion rings (Oh my God), and a peanut butter milkshake. Everything was delicious, especially the onion rings. Their prices are very reasonable-I think I paid $8 for everything. However, one of the best things about this experience were the servers. As soon as I pulled up, they were out there asking me what I wanted to eat. They were quick to bring the food and quick to bring the check. Well done Swesons. You have earned your five stars."}
{"text":"Imagine this - it's 10pm on a rainy night and you and your friends are craving a classic carbohydrate/protein heavy meal for a cannot-be-beaten price. Oh and let's say, you also do not want to get out of your car. Where to go? 

...Swenson's! Freshly built with a grand opening just a week ago - this is officially your late night burger/fries/milkshake joint that will make the drive down Cedar Rd absolutely worth it. This is a drive-in type of restaurant, just park your car in one of the slots, and keep your headlights on until one of the servers runs to your window to take your order. The Galley Boy burger is the classic cheeseburger to order for a first-timer at Swenson's. Pairs wonderfully with a chocolate malt milkshake and a side of Potato Teezers and Fried Mushrooms! Don't forget to ask for extra napkins because the entire experience might lead to excessive drooling. 

They don't collect payment until they bring the food out to your car, so just sit back and enjoy the in-car conversation or listen to your own customized playlist of sweet jams while you wait for the ultimate burger of burgers to arrive. You will be in disbelief when you see the check - only at Swenson's can you get a delicious filling burger for under $5."}
{"text":"I still remember the first time I had a galley boy. When I was a lot younger, my father took me to Swensons after a soap box derby meeting. I can't tell you how much I enjoy the galley boy. It's so simple yet so perfect...a double cheeseburger with a special sauce. It has a slightly sweet flavor to it. I cant figure out if its the bun or just another part of the sauce, but it goes well with the richness of everything else.   

I've tried a few other sides and shakes, but have never ventured away from my old standby. Everything is really good. Exactly what you'd expect from an establishment trying to maintain traditions of the old drive in restaurants. 

Top notch service, the galley boy and the old timey feel are just a few reasons you should go to Swensons when you're in the area!"}
{"text":"It is good fast food. One of the only fast food places I would choose to go. It is also fun to eat in your car!"}
{"text":"Something different and non corporate if youre going to have a cheat day! Happy with vegetarian options for myself and prefer my food \"in a basket\". My son and i shared a rootbeer milkshake, which was great."}
{"text":"This one of our go to places for lunch. The Galley Boy is always great and the old school feel of the place makes it fun."}
{"text":"Onion rings are the absolute best.  I think the burgers are just okay.  I think Five Guys has a superior burger.  But I like a local institution like Swenson's, and what's not to love about the employees running around, yelling orders, and busting their tails to serve you?  Service is flat out friendly and excellent.  Tip them accordingly, please. I tipped 30%."}
{"text":"Very good service! The food is tasty! If Steak N' Shake and Sonic made a baby it would be called Swenson's! The potato teasers are awesome, especially with ranch! The only thing I don't like is that it sits in your stomach like a rock! But all in all I enjoyed it and will be returning when in the area!"}
{"text":"Always amazing food!!! I could eat 17 galley boys in one trip!!! I bring someone here on a first date"}
{"text":"You gotta get the Galley Boy! Their shakes and onion rings are great too! Fast service  right to your car!"}
{"text":"Swensons, man. This is how much I like Swensons. I literally eat every meal there when I'm in the Akron area, playing gigs. I don't even care if I get a free meal at the venue I'm playing; I'm turning it down and going to Swensons. Give me a Galley Boy and fries, and it's perfection. One of my favorite restaurants in America."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers you can get in the city. Local joint with the throwback car hop appeal. Super friendly staff and your food is cooked to order and comes out fast and fresh."}
{"text":"I want to start this review by stating that I truly am not a burger fan. I don't usually order burgers from restaurants. I also had never had Swenson's before so there is no air of nostalgia in my review.


This is just DARN GOOD food. I got the potato teasers and those things are addictive. They're crunchy on the outside, cheesy and gooey on the inside, and have a very slight heat to them from the jalapeno. They are truly the stuff of dreams. If I ever were forced to chose a last snack, potato teasers would be it.

I also got a double cheeseburger with everything. When I first saw the burger I was admittedly underwhelmed... how could something so small and plain looking be as delicious as everyone claims? Taking one bite took all of those feelings away. The burger was everything you want in a burger. The bun was slightly sweet and perfectly toasted. The onions were crisp and not overwhelming. The cheese was gooey and delicious and the meat was amazing - thin patties cooked to perfection. The combination was just perfect and was all under $8. I'm currently kicking myself in the butt for waiting until now to try out Swenson's."}
{"text":"I might skew this review because I love and crave this place so much.  I live in Colorado and have had burgers all over. I get the hype over in n out but personally swenesons galley boys is a burger I want all the time and the shakes are amazing."}
{"text":"Great service fast great food the chili dogs is boom my first impression is I will be back to try other things on the menu it warms up good that a plus"}
{"text":"Everything about Swenson's is perfect.  It's a drive in restaurant, so it has that novelty going for it.  Forget about everything else on the menu (except maybe the milkshakes, if you're in the mood), because all you need are the burgers.  Their specialty is the Galley Boy, a double cheeseburger with two kinds of special sauce, but the regular cheeseburgers don't disappoint either.  There's some kind of special seasoning in the meat (rumors say a touch of brown sugar?), and the buns are lightly toasted and perfect.

The rest of the menu might as well not exist, because the burgers are just that perfect.  If you live in the area or are passing through, there is no excuse not to try it.  By the way, they have seven locations throughout the Northeast Ohio area, not just this one, so go to their website, http://www.swensonsdriveins.com/, to find the closest near you."}
{"text":"This place is the best burgers. I'm addicted to it and having galley boy for every day for the past 1.5 week. It's so good. Fried mushroom is good, milkshake is good, cheese burger is good, everything is good and worth the price. The east coast In-n-out!"}
{"text":"Holy cats!! So I've seen Swensons on FN and it was right on.  The wait staff was super quick (running in 30 degrees has to suck), nice and efficient.  The food was cheap and really delicious.  The galley boy was top notch, puffs aka tater tots, onion rings, and teezers, oh my the teezers they are fantastic.  Sides are small so maybe you want to order more than 6.  I'll be back next time I'm remotely close."}
{"text":"This Swenson's is a slight upgrade from MacDonald and more expensive. It will satisfy your greasy burger cravings. The burgers are smaller than I thought they would be. The service was alright. We went when it was not very crowded. They seemed a little bit all over place but it is relatively new."}
{"text":"When Swenson's is serving their pumpkin milkshakes, you must try them. I haven't had anything as divine outside of a straight up pumpkin pie. The servers are always fast and they are ready for you to order to moment they come to your car. I have always loved their cheeseburgers and others in my family swear by the Galley Boy. Stopping at Swenson's is something we often look forward to when traveling to Stow."}
{"text":"Swensons is the best burger place in town. I always call ahead and the order is ready when I get there. I've never had a bad experience. Galley boy and teasers are the way to go. And don't forget the awesome side of ranch!"}
{"text":"In Akron area Staple! These are the best burgers... Milkshakes and fries don't disappoint either!"}
{"text":"Okay pretty cool thing about this place is when you ask for a water they give it to you in a bag. Literally a bag of water, pretty sure you're not gonna beat that anywhere. Especially at Sonic. Anyway this place had a warm environment, literally, because the AC in our car was not working :( 

I had the galley boy and I shared my potato teasers because IM A NICE GUY. I did thoroughly enjoy my experience here, I mean, its always good. If you are from out of town you need to stop here for real, its a staple. But, the one complaint I had is the waiter had no clue where any of the pokemon were. He actually said, \"i dont know.\" C'mon bro. 

It was a good bite!"}
{"text":"Meh.  It's local McDonald's food.  Nothing special.  It's cheap and a local business.  Nothing else.  Those who rave for it only live here in small town mentality-land, and have not experienced anything else."}
{"text":"How is it that I haven't written a review for this place?  What a travesty.  

This wonderful neighborhood establishment is close to my house and is always open when I want a quick burger hit.  It isn't fancy but I just that sense of going back in time to a place where service was different and people were friendly and smiled a lot more.  I love me some Galley Boys and jalepeno poppers.  Not high brow food, by any standards, but what an amazing, sweet/savory, mouthful of joy those burgers are.  And what reasonable prices.  It is amazing to me that there are fast food places surrounding this place.  How do they stay in business?  Swensons is more tasty, more delicious and more Ohio than any of them.   The shrimp dinner was also delicious, fresh and a good value, BTW."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat food pretty good. Not to expensive staff nice this place will be great this summer."}
{"text":"So this is an Akron tradition, thus I had to try. Maybe the build-up was too much, but I wasn't overly impressed with the burgers. They were greasy, but a significant upgrade over normal fast food. However, I don't tend to eat fast food, so I was comparing to other restaurants known for their burgers and swensons just doesn't measure up. If I was in a rush, I'd eat it again. But I'm not going out of my way to get swensons despite the pleas from the masses in Akron that claim these are the best burgers ever."}
{"text":"All I can say is after moving to Los Angeles the first thing I want when I go back home is Swensons.  All the places here don't compare to Swensons.  I miss youuuu."}
{"text":"The galley boy is delicious! I think the special sauce on this is some kind of barbecue sauce. Their burgers have a little bit of a sweet bit to them. If you like jalape√±o poppers then you'll love the potato teezers. The brownie sundae is also a nice little treat for dessert. The brownie comes hot and paired with the ice cream it's perfect for a warm summer day!"}
{"text":"Order the hot dog. They need saurekraut but the buns are the best. Milkshakes all good but please get some sugar free ice cream. love the waiters, very polite and fun."}
{"text":"I finally got to have a burger from Swensons! I have lived in Ohio 17 years, always heard about them but never had one. Last night we were headed home from
Cleveland and our usual burger place was closed so I was scrolling thru Yelp for ideas when Swensens popped up! We were so excited they were open till midnight - and just down the way from where we were that we headed right over! 

It's not your typical drive thru. You don't pull up to a brightly lit Kiosk and ouch buttons and order over an intercom, nope you pull up, park and leave your lights on for service. They come out to your car, bring you a menu and then pop back shortly to take your order. 
The menu is simple but still gives you plenty of choices. 

They have everything from cheeseburgers to chicken baskets but we stuck to the old fashioned cheeseburgers since it's what they are known best for. I had a single cheeseburger with fries and a caramel shake, Rhyan had a double cheeseburger, potato puffs and a root beer and Chara (our no meat eater) had coleslaw and fries. She and I also grabbed tots to split. My cheeseburger was so good! I eat them plain just meat and cheese and it was so tasty and so filling that I couldn't finish my fries and never even tasted a tot - or potato puff as they call it! Easily one of my favorite fast food burgers and one I am already wanting again. It was juicy without being greasy and seasoned really well for being a fast food burger. The fries are delicious, too. They are not thin and a perfect combination of crunchy on outside and soft on inside. My caramel shake was extra thick (they add real ice cream for $1 to make it extra thick and it's soooo good) and very flavorful. It was worth the calorie splurge! 
Rhyan loved her burger and her potato puffs. She couldn't finish all her puffs (you get 13 in an order). It got 4 stars from her! 
Chara loved the fries, too. She did not care for the coleslaw - said it tasted like it had celery salt in it and she's not a fan. But the fries were awesome so that was cool! Her extra thick chocolate malt was just what she had been wanting and it was delicious. 
We go to Cleveland a lot so this will probably become a new go to for us when we need a quick meal. I'm looking forward to it already!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. It's fast, cheap, and the food is fantastic. I can't stress how cheap it actually was; I think my entire meal was less than 4$."}
{"text":"Quite simply AMAZING!  Order a Galley Boy, eat and repeat! Service is great! Burgers are the best. This is an Ohio treat that my Ohio family that I married into kept from me for 23 years. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"In an ideal world, every McDonald's employee would be taken out back at gunpoint.  \"You can now work for Swenson's,\" they'd say, \"Or we can put a bullet in your head.\"  

Then every McDonald's would be transformed to have the best burger in the whole dang world.  And anyone who complained that they couldn't get their McNuggets would be shot in the head, and the world would be a better place.

I said in a previous review that Bearden's had the best burgers in town.  I was wrong.  This place has the most amazing burgers I've ever had... And as an extra-special blast, you get it in a retro-cuisine drive-in fashion!

That's right.  You drive up, and park, and flash the lights, and a guy RUNS out to your car to take your order.  Then he comes back with a tray, and he sticks it on your window, and you eat in the car and play the Grease soundtrack and feel quite the hipster at eating at a drive-in.  

The burgers are amazing.  The buns are like Hawaiian bread, very sweet and light and tasty, whereas the burgers are quality meat, done correctly.  You want bacon?  It's actual goddamned bacon.  And the burgers are like $2.50 apiece, amazingly cheap (although you pay extra for every add-on, including tomatoes and lettuce).  

They have fried mushrooms that are... Well, they're okay.  I mean, they're fried mushrooms, which have the traditional problem of that if you eat them in two bites, the coating breaks free of the slippery mushroom inside, and you're eating either a shell or a mushroom.  

They also have seventeen flavors of shakes.  The shakes are thick and tasty; I had a butterscotch that was heavy on the butterscotch flavoring, and didn't feel made from ice cream - maybe it was, but it was more in the McDonald's vein of \"gooey stuff\" than \"milk with ice cream bits in it.\"  But then again, maybe I waited too long to eat it. 

The only ding I have against Swenson's is that they have yet to take over the world and shoot all the McDonald's.  I'm waiting, people.  I'll even fill out the gun permits for you, if you ask nicely."}
{"text":"I moved to Parma from the Akron area and thought I was going to go into convulsions from a lack of the occasional Swenson's burger.  It's just something I NEED every once in a while. The week I moved here a friend told me about this random Swenson's location, but he warned me that it may not be as good as the others. 

Thankfully he was wrong. It's just as good as all of the other Swenson's locations. The burger is the same. In my opinion, there quite simply is no better burger than the Swenson's burger. I find it difficult to trust people who don't like them. 

Don't go to Sonic, Rally's, or some lame national franchise. Swenson's was started in Akron and is a Northeast Ohio gem. Go there. Try the burgers. Bask in the glory of the deliciousness. Get hooked."}
{"text":"Swensons is always a classic. For many years now, I have been making the trip to Swensons. Until January 2018, I would have to make the trip to seven hills. Since this location opened, I have been able to reduce travel time. 

This was the second time I had come to this location. This location looks much newer and better than other locations. The food as always was amazing. The galley boy is the best burger you will find. With my burger I also got potato teezers with Cajun seasoning. This is one of the best choices on the menu. For my beverage, I got the Ohio. The Ohio is a cherry drink. This is one of the best drinks I've ever had. Everything on the menu is cheap and very delicious. You won't go wrong at Swensons. 

Now I only have a few minor complaints. The first is that this location is off of a main road which makes it hard to enter and exit. Not a huge deal since there aren't a lot of cars trying to get in and out. My seconds complaint is that there are a limited number of parking spaces. This doesn't seem like they will be an issue most of the time, but it seems like there are far fewer parking spaces than other locations. My third complaint is the it felt like most of the employees working today were trainees. I understand that Swensons has a lot of trainees and that they are trainees for a while, but it seemed like an excessive amount. My final complaint is that I had my lights on for service for about 5 minutes before I was helped. I could see about 4 employees just standing inside doing nothing instead of coming to assist me. 

Overall, the food is amazing, and other than my slight issue today, the service is amazing. This would definitely be at the top of my list for places to go while in the Cleveland/Akron area."}
{"text":"Love this place
They run to you car take your order run back in!
Signs out front are nothing to special but sometimes they just amuse me"}
{"text":"The most delicious cheeseburgers I've ever had.  The melted velveeta-like cheese product envelopes the juicy, freshly grilled, slightly sweet patties, that are nestled next to fresh vegetables and pickles, all held between two liberally buttered and lightly toasted buns.  I highly recommend the Galley boy, which is their double cheeseburger smothered with two special sauces and adorned with a cocktail olive.  Mmmmmm, just thinking about Swensons makes me salivate profusely."}
{"text":"I am now a fan of Swensons. I ordered a Salad Boy, which is a veggie burger. It was absolutely amazing. I also had a peanut butter milkshake. It was extremely enjoyable. I will definitely be going back to Swensons."}
{"text":"Came up with my daughter for a college visit at the University of Akron and was told we couldn't leave without getting a Galley Boy from Swensons....IT WAS DELICIOUS, service was PHENOMENAL!! The servers seriously couldn't of been any better! Great experience and amazing food! Would recommend to everyone visiting Akron!!!"}
{"text":"I wish there was a Swensons on the east coast.  The burger was so good.  Better than any chain-type/drive-in burger I have ever had.  Better than In-N-Out, and I LOVE In-N-Out.  I got the Galley Boy burger.  The sauces are out of this world and the burger patties are juicy and flavorful.  I inhaled the burger in about 2 minutes.  I also ordered the fried mushrooms, fried zucchini, potato puffs.  All decent, but nowhere near as good compared to the Galley Boy.  The service was also awesome.  Better than Sonic and In-N-Out.  My guy was running and got everything I wanted.  I was in and out in about 5 minutes (this included the cooking time for the burgers and fried foods).  Great experience.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I had heard legendary stories about the mighty Swenson's, but never had a place to test them for veracity...

They are true. 
The Galley Boy burger is one of the BEST I've ever tasted. 
The Fried Bologna smothered in onions is great. 
The Fries; tasty. 
The Onion Rings; More so. 
AND...they bring it all to your car. 
Also, the great kids working at this place are positive, upbeat and helpful, rain or shine. I can't give them a tip big enough for that. When a younger person brings you hot food in 20 below weather, with a SMILE on their face, hell, that's just true grit there folks!

The parking is, of course, plentiful, the service, great, the food is tasty. 
All in all, I make Swenson's a part of my ramblings whenever I can:)"}
{"text":"I lived in Ohio for two years and didn't try Swenson's until three days before I was moving out of the state.

That was dumb.

Drive up.  Turn your lights on.  Order a Galley Boy (or two) with a side of teezers and a peanut butter shake.  Turn your lights off.  Wait five minutes.  Roll down your window for the car hop.  Devour (the food, not the car hop!)."}
{"text":"Drive-in restaurants were immensely popular decades ago, and a recent visit to Swensons evoked a pleasant nostalgia, as I fondly remembered the old Eat 'n' Park from my childhood.  

Carhops scurrying from car to car, taking orders and delivering food with such an earnest friendliness that you will almost forget that you are dining \"by the dashboard light.\"  Our carhop immediately asked to take our order, assuming we were another group of Swemson's countless regular customers.

The specialty here is the \"Galley Boy\", a double cheeseburger with two sweet/tangy sauces, garnished with a Spanish olive.  Hot and tasty, the burger was filling, yet easy to eat and not nearly as messy as I thought it would be.  

The menu is surprisingly vast. Along with their in-house ground beef burger selections, a variety of sandwiches and fried sides are offered, along with salads, soups, chili, and 18 different milkshake flavors.  

Overall, a delicious throwback that will feel like you stepped into an episode of \"Happy Days\"   Not sure why all the carhops were guys, though. I was told that this was a Swensons tradition, but it still seems a bit odd, if not discriminatory."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here during our road trip to Cleveland and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  I love burgers and after learning LeBron likes this place we thought we should give it a try.  We were not disappointed!  Great service.  Great food and reasonable prices.  I had the Galley Boy, onion rings and a chocolate shake.  It was all yummy including the nicely grilled burger bun.  Try it!"}
{"text":"I can't explain or describe how good the food is here but it should be illegal. It's a old school drive in where the kids are running around to get you your food. I suggest the simple burgers or grilled cheese but my friends love Galley Boys. You really can't go wrong here though."}
{"text":"2nd time here as an adult. As a kid I had fond memories of delicious food! But what does a child know right! 
Ordered the galley burger, mediocre patty with BBQ sauce on one bun tarter sauce on the other, just blah! 
Chili! This is not chili! 90% beans & very bland .
Chicken nuggets were processed spongy and fried in old oil. Also had the potato teazers would have been enjoyable it the were fried in fresher oil. Thought about taking my granddaughter there in the future but I doubt that I will return."}
{"text":"Yummy! I got the \"salad boy\" it was good. I'm not a vegetarian but I love veggie burgers. It's exactly like the \"galley boy\" but a veg burger. Also got the jalape√±o pooper things. Good! (I couldn't remember the official names of anything, sorry!)"}
{"text":"Runners waiting as I pull in to order! Always excellent food with amazing service. Get a California and a Galley Boy!"}
{"text":"Awesome service. Great customer care. Super fast and friendly. Gotta get the galley boy and potato teasers. Love swensons"}
{"text":"AmaZing service!!! Super quick! Get the galley boy!!!! Californias are the best drink and you can't go wrong with potato teasers!"}
{"text":"I can barely contain my happiness in finding your restaurant--I had never been to a Swensons before, but a friend told me a bit about the place. Once I found it--right there, near Beachwood Place on Cedar, I had to try it. I love it! The salad boy is delicious--and the melted cheese on it makes it even better. The minty drink you offer is yummy as well. I am impressed with the flavored soda add-in options. The kids running out to the cars are fast as lightning."}
{"text":"I have said for years that my death row meal would be a large chocolate shake, two galley boys light white sauce and a teezer - yes two it's a death row mea after all...lol.  Swensons is a true Northeast Ohio GEM...I was practically a giddy school girl seeing this new location show up on my YELP locator while I was sitting in my doctors waiting room. 

This one was delicious and consistent as Swensons is - crumbly brown perfect bun on my Galley Boy, cheese and bbq sauce oozing out, hot and jalape√±o-y tangy teezers and a small chocolate shake.  Super fantastic especially on the sunny day we visited. 

This one only got four stars as while I know it's new they were slow and not super busy at 3:10 on a Friday...forgot condiments (completely even after asked) but when we added onto our order as a carry out last minute decision they were super nice and fast. So I'm sure it will be five stars on the next on...

UPDATE: 
Sad that I have to do this but this place isn't working out - and this time it's not me it's you...your way too slow and give the excuse of being still new (six months?), the food all came out cold - and no one ever checked...the drinks didn't come and I asked the car hop said well what was your entire order  yeah um no we are missing two drinks I'm not a Jedi and going thru an order for three ppl and two toddlers...really disappointed and told the second server we had as the first ghosted - I won't go back.  I love their food but when spending $40 a car trip and it's cold, not right and no drinkies - that's not Swensons that's everybody else (or was)."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The waiters sprint out to your car as soon as you pull up. Service is great, prices are very low, and the burgers are fantastic. I can honestly say that I enjoyed the burger here more than at in n out. For $3.25 there isn't a better burger out there."}
{"text":"What the heck can you say about a Galley Boy! The crackly crumbly perfection of a bakery roll that is browned and ready for patties!  Two delicious patties, American cheese, Swiss cheese, tartar style sauce with pickle relish and BBQ sauce - grab a chocolate shake and a side of tater teasers (holy crap!) - you will LOVE this meal and want it over and over and over...

The service is exceptional - the runners to and from your car - still with a smile and wanting to make sure you enjoy your Swensons experience.  Really wish there was one closer to Mentor area..."}
{"text":"Very fun dining! The staff has been friendly and helpful on every visit. We love taking out-of- town visitors here because it's a unique experience. Highly recommend the chocolate milkshake... you don't think you can have a bad milkshake until you have this one and realize how delicious it can be!! Perfect fry dipping texture. Moderately priced, worth the price for the experience."}
{"text":"It's always nice to be able to return to a restaurant after a long haitus to see that nothing has changed. Sometimes, that's a bad thing, but not for Swenson's. I haven't been here in well over two years, and the quality of the food has remained the same. Great cheeseburger, amazing onion rings, and wonderful phosphates. I will certainly make sure that my next visit isn't two years in the making."}
{"text":"The finest burger in NE Ohio.

My go to order: Galley Boy, Cheeseburger with everything, Potato Teasers with a side of ranch.

Shake flavors I like - Pumpkin and Key Lime (both seasonal, I believe)

Great place, go, enjoy, tip the runners."}
{"text":"TOTALLY REGRETTABLE!

Swensons has been in business for 1934 and is (no doubt), serving the same food from that era.  Why are they still here? 

 Based on its apparently over-hyped iconic stature, I thought that we should definitely see if Swenson actually lives up to its reputation.  

  My husband made a run and returned with onion rings, fries,  a hotdog and a couple of burgers.

The regretta-rings were heavily breaded with an almost undetectable slice of onion. I need my onion rings to actually have onion in them.

The regretta-dog tasted like a hotdog that had the flavor extracted by some super-sonic vacuum and tasted like a mistake.  It was beyond bland and tasted like absolutely nothing.

The regretta-burger on that horrible \"Let me get this one out of my pocket\" regretta-bun was ridiculous.  It wasn't seasoned and the bun was not fresh.  This is the type of food that you scrape into your dog's dish as soon as the cook leaves the kitchen.  

One and done!

***Their fries were actually hot and delicious but were simply overshadowed by the overall bad presentation of the food."}
{"text":"Double cheeseburger is delicious. They also have a great variety of milkshake flavors and plenty of sides to choose from. Definitely try it out if your in the Akron area."}
{"text":"A friend at work introduced me to Swensons! It is absolutely phenomenal! The sauces on the Galley Boy are amazing! It's a barbecue, sweet savory flavoring! The drink called the California is to die for! Grape soda is my all time favorite and Swensons does it just right! Their service is fast and your food is always fresh and hot! The car hops are all so nice, and could answer any question about the menu that you have! I HIGHLY recommend Swensons to anyone in the area! It's definitely one for the bucket list!"}
{"text":"I just love Swenson's.  I originally found them down in Cuyahoga Falls/Akron.  Old fashioned hamburger joint that you sit in your car and they bring out your food.

The Galley Boy burger is simply joy-gasmic.  The special sauce that includes sweet relish hidden in the mayonnaise super yummy.  The burger patties are so delicious and tender.  The bun is perfectly toasty and tasty.

Root beer shake?  MMMMM.  Fried mushrooms?  Of course!  

Sure, there are other things on the menu, but I've never deviated.  I'm craving a Galley Boy as I type.

Now, let's talk about the cute young college boys in shorts that dash in and out of the building when you turn on your lights.  They are so friendly, and man, do they move!  When your order comes out, it hangs on your door.  Love it!  

Try it.  You'll love it.  Tip those boys!"}
{"text":"Oh how I love this place! I was driving to the Seven Hills location once a week when I was pregnant, so this new one being so close makes me very happy! My go to meal is a Galley Boy and potato teasers with ranch on the side. So delicious. They also have amazing milkshakes and  I am a big fan of their brownie sundae! The staff is quick and super friendly. Check this place out"}
{"text":"The crew takes pride in their jobs and that's key for a drive-in, fast food joint, The entire Swenson's brand is packed with locations full of hard working men and women you make exceptionally tasty burgers, the get you in and out fast, and they're super awesome to talk to and hang out with while they take your order. Gotta love the Galley Boy (hamburger)!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Swensons! Their service is amazing. Someone almost always gets to my car before I even shut off my engine. If you need something else, just turn on your headlights and someone will come right away, literally running to your car.

Galley Boy burger is a must! It is a double cheese burger and you can get whatever you want on it. Super juicy so make sure you have plenty of napkins. They have the \"everything\" option, which includes pickles, onions, and mustard. I also love getting the potato teasers and mushrooms, yum!! Potato teasers are basically like jalape√±o poppers, so if you're into that, I recommend it.

You can eat in your car or take it to-go. If it's a nice day, I definitely take advantage and eat there. They have these trays that hang onto your window. As for drinks, I highly recommend the half and half! It's half lemonade, half tea and it's amazing! During my most recent visit, the half and half tasted a little watered down, but I let our server know so he immediately replaced it with a freshly made batch. I always leave Swensons extremely satisfied!"}
{"text":"I've been a Swensons fan since I was a kid eating at the original in Akron. The Galley Boy, with its two beef patties, cheese, and special sauces is a classic. If you prefer no meat, try the Salad Boy made with a veggie pattie. Also the potato teasers (jalapeno and cheese tayer tot like things) or fried mushrooms or onion rings round out your daily cholesterol. Wash it all down with a California (grapey ginger ale) or a shake or malt. 

It's one of the first things I do in the spring. I eat healthier most of the time, but this is one place I will happily eat unhealthy food and not regret a thing."}
{"text":"Galley Boy + Zucchini Sticks + Chocolate Malt = Happiness."}
{"text":"Swensons left quite a bit to be desired. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to the service. We waited for over 25 minutes for service (with our lights on) while watching cars that arrived 15 minutes after ours get served immediately. Some cars were even served as they were parking!! We actually had to get OUT of the car to flag someone down. The food was okay, not as good as I've had at other Swensons. This was likely a one time experience, at least for the next year until service delivery improves."}
{"text":"A great family, quick place to eat. Would love if there was a variety of toppings outside of the normal burger ones. The Pace is fast and the staff seem very nice."}
{"text":"The best burgers, with mustard and onion and a toasted bun, in the country (let alone Akron). I love their fried mushrooms or onion rings too. I also order their signature \"California\" which is a soft drink that's been on their menu forever--can't remember the ingredients except sprite, maybe? This place doesn't give you a menu unless you ask because everyone knows what they like in Akron. Please turn on your car lights for service. As a child, they only hired guys as car hops, but now they don't discriminate. The servers are known for their \"running\" from car to car--part of their longstanding fast service culture. I have never been a Galley-boy (a type of burger) fan but some people love it. For me, the hard choice is whether to order two regular burgers or just one...yum. Rumor has it they put sugar in their beef--this coming from an Akronite who has friends that owned a meat-packing business, but who knows if it's true or not. Anyhow, this is Lebron's favorite place too, so check it out."}
{"text":"Great restaurant awesome service the food taste really good. A great place to take the kids for a different type of experience where you eat in the car."}
{"text":"I am not sure what the hype is about this place. They put burgers together sooooo sloppy. Nothing special at all. Was a bit high in price. I got the special double cheeseburger. I mean I get it comes with two sauces but it should not be slopped on extra thick. The green olive on top of the wrapper with the toothpick through it is just silly and unnecessary. They burger was decent and the serve was nice but I'm not a pig so don't serve me slop."}
{"text":"Sitting in Wendy's drive thru, about to place my order, I remembered there was a Swenson's not too far away and I hadn't tried it yet so I immediately left Wendy's to try it out. I've been hearing so much about Swenson's and how good the Galley Boy was so that's what I got when I went, I added bacon and lettuce; I also got the potato teezers. 

Let me start off by saying, the service was extremely great! Everyone was super nice, smiles on their faces and willing to help in whatever way I needed; they were also very fast. The person taking my order said he didn't recommend that I add bacon because the burger alone was good enough but I add bacon to everything so I didn't listen lol. I got my food and the potato teezers were super hot, fresh out of the grease and tasted pretty good! However, I was so disappointed in my burger. It didn't have much flavor, it was dry, and the bacon on the sandwich was cold and chewy so I ate half of it and threw it away. I would have been much more satisfied staying at Wendy's instead. I gave this place 3 stars bc the workers were superb but I wouldn't go back for food, maybe I'll try a shake in the future."}
{"text":"Love the food, server was super nice and have us great speedy service and it was packed! Galley Boy didn't disappoint along with the onion rings and fried mushrooms! Will be back here often!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time having Swensons. It did not disappoint. The wait was kind of long but it was so worth it. I ordered the double bacon cheese burger with toppings, fries, and peanut butter shake. I enjoyed all of it!! It made me want to eat it the next day. I'm disappointed that there is not one in Cleveland. Definitely a must stop while I'm in the city of Akron again."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever dining at Swensons. I ordered the Galley burger and fried mushrooms with an Orange Florida. Absolutely amazing! The food was fresh and hot, and most importantly, the service was great. Our waiters were so attentive and friendly. I will definitely be back to try out their milkshakes and dessert menu!"}
{"text":"It's Swensons! Galley Boy, Onion Rings, Hot Fudge Shake! Brought right to your car. It doesn't get any better!"}
{"text":"My favorite burger on planet Earth, period. Simply on a completely different plane from In-N-Out, Five Guys and the endless other contenders I've enjoyed. I live in Chicago now, but hit Swenson's (this one or the one on Cuyahoga Falls Ave.) for a Galley Boy (or two), onion rings and a chocolate malt whenever I make it home. I hope they'll someday allow me to open their first Chicago location. Honestly, this place could go national in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Went back today. What a difference like night and day the sandwiches were hot crispy bacon and I couldn't say enough like the real thing"}
{"text":"Very awesome place to eat!! This was my first time here and the food is delicious, as well as the chocolate malt. The waitstaff was extremely friendly, probably the friendliest staff at a restaurant that I've come across in a long time! Food came out in less than 10 min! Keep up the exceptional work!"}
{"text":"Can't beat this place! The blueberry milkshake is amazing. Galley boy is a good go to option. Service is fast."}
{"text":"Great: 
Milkshakes
Onion rings

Good:
Galley burger
Fried mushrooms

Meh:
Fries (mine were soggy)

Cool, fun drive in with hard working peeps. Was it the best burger I've ever had? Nope! Best fast burger? Nope. Good burger? Absolutely!

I'd def come back for a fun, casual meal!"}
{"text":"Living in LA now...and everytime I come home I just have to go to Swensons! It's still has the best burgers anywhere.  Double cheeseburger with everything + fried mushrooms all the way!"}
{"text":"Cheap, quick and MIND BLOWING. For someone reason it does take 2 visits to really appreciate it. The first time, the usual responses is \"it's just okay\" but it's MUCH more than just okay. Best burgers ever. Like nothing compares. Jalape√±o poppers are an excellent side as well. Always friendly services."}
{"text":"I am craving a Galley Boy right now! Haven't found any burger yet in the Chicago area that compares to this wonderful burger. It's the secret sauce that makes it! YUM. 

If you're ever in Kent, this fast food joint deserves a visit! Be sure to have plenty of extra napkins in your car!"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. The people serving you food are amazing and fun to watch.
The food is nothing special. Tasteless"}
{"text":"Swensons is horrible now. They only make burgers well done. Totally ruined their food and not to mention they went back on their \"no ketchup\" on burgers rule. They now load way to much ketchup on the burgers and that also ruins the flavor of their burgers. Swensons is now just another fast food restaurant. This goes for all Swensons locations. Goto Wayback or Five Guys. You will not only get better food, but you will also get service when needed. Swesons is extremly slow on service. I waited 10 minutes before having my order taken. There was 4 cars in the entire parking lot. I watched the kid that took my order stand in the door window on his phone for a good 5 minutes before he walked around the building afew times before asking if i was ready to place an order. I even flashed my brights trying to get his attention. I do not recommend Swesons, especially the one in Montrose/Fairlawn."}
{"text":"Swenson's has been an Akron staple since 1934 and they still have the traditional car hop service. They are serving up classic burgers, fries, shakes and much more. Along with their stable Galley Boy burger with special sauce and potatoe teasers, they also offer steak, chicken, fish, pork and sloppy joe sandwiches. They also have hotdogs, soups, salads, onion rings and so much more. All the young kids taking your order are definitely providing great customer service and running their butts off. 

We stopped in late night to cure that craving and ordered their galley boy cheeseburger, a fried bologna sandwich, a fried chicken filet and a couple of orders of fries. Let's start with the galley boy, the burger is great, it has all the toppings and their special sauce to me seems like a concoction of sweet and tangy it really adds a nice finish to the burger. The fried bologna is a nice thick cut peice grilled to perfection. And the fried chicken filet took me back to old school cafeteria chicken sandwich they used to serve in school. This place has great food and great nostalgia."}
{"text":"Swensons is the best burger place ever! The bugers are average size and everything but something about the way they make them makes them stand out. Lightly toasted, buttered bun. Brown sugar in the burger? Most like the special galley boy but regular burgers, chicken sandwiches, etc are da bomb too. Wide selectin of toppings, sides, milkshakes and drinks.

Definitely worth a stop if you like burgers and are in the area.

Service is always good too, quickly and always friendly."}
{"text":"These burgers are phenomenal! The Galley Boy just melts in your mouth, and paired with the potato teasers and a milkshake it is like heaven on Earth."}
{"text":"The first few times I got this location the California (which is the best drink there) wasn't very good. It literally tasted like poison. BUT the last few times I've gone everything was really good. They have the best burgers in Ohio for their prices."}
{"text":"Classic Drive In service. Sonic eat your heart out

Burgers are tasty and prepared to order.  The flavor is almost nostalgic. Reminds me of how grandma used to make them -- excellent

Sides are good and service is quick"}
{"text":"Good food and great service. I've been here a few times and the service is always great, I really appreciate all the running around and hustling. I absolutely love the egg salad sandwich and the vegetable soup. I do wish they'd clarify in the menu that there's meat in it, not just vegetables. The food tastes super fresh and is seasoned well. The prices seriously can't be beat either."}
{"text":"My first time visiting Swensons, even though it's been on my list of places to try for some time.   I went on a very warm Saturday afternoon, just before the dinner rush.  A runner/server immediately approached my car, and handed me a menu, telling me to take my time reviewing the menu, asking me to turn on my headlights when ready to order.  I opted for the single cheeseburger, fries and vanilla shake.   My food arrived a short time later.  The best part of the meal was, by far, the vanilla shake.  My shake was creamy, thick and tasty.  The fries were pretty good too, nice and hot.  The burger was just ok, the bun was toasted and a bit crumbly and the cheese tasted more like a sauce than a slice of cheese.  All in all, the food was probably 3 stars, but the overall experience was definitely 4 stars.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Since I started working right by this swensons, it's become my go to after work... I usually get take out and it takes 5-7 minutes. I've got nothing bad to say about the food. I love getting a bacon cheeseburger and French fries. I typically like my French fries with a crisp outer layer. Asking for regular fries, they're usually pretty soft but they still taste done. I followed a review on here and asked for them extra crunchy. They were much more to my standards but some were close to burnt. I've had pretty good experiences with the waiters with the exception of tonight. The waiter seemed to kind of have an attitude when I was ordering then he preceded to go hangout with the girls in the car next to me for 15 minutes. Don't get me wrong, I have no issues waiting but really?? The girls ordered 10 minutes after me and got their food before me. Then a different waiter brought me my food. Kind of irritating but I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love your Galley Boy burger, and everything else. Fast and friendly. Good location and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"We love Swenson's!  Unfortunately the sizes (and the legendary sweetness) of the burgers have diminished.  We still go for the double cheeseburgers and fried mushrooms!  Our last trip was amazing!  We asked for \"extra crunchy\" fries - our runner asked the cook to \"dump 'em twice\".  They were sizzling and crunchy!  Delish!!  

Sadly, they only have limited caffeine-free drinks on the menu (only their lemonade has no caffeine).  This means that cherry and orange soda, and gingerale all have caffeine.  Seriously?  C'mon, what about those of us that want our kids to sleep at night?  We order take away and pour our healthy drinks at home."}
{"text":"Heard that if you are in town, that you just HAVE to try Swensons. Have the Galley Burger which was good as were the fries. Also tried the Chocolate shake which was not very good. Service friendly, fast and entertaining - overall a fun place to try, but didn't blow me away."}
{"text":"Galley boy was delicious. Service amazing. Food is inexpensive but quality. A great drive in experience!"}
{"text":"ok ok, silly me, I should have taken the advice of all the other yelpers on here and ordered the Galley Boy, but I wasn't super hungry when I went to Swensons, booo, next time though, I will pick up the gauntlet.

So, FAST service, no wonder those kids were so skinny, they were doing laps around that little shack like you would not believe!

I got the cheeseburger with everything, except when it came, they forgot the \"everything\" and I just got a patty with cheese on it, but I'm not one to complain or send many things back so I just went with it.  Good burger but I'm sure it could have been much improved with some toppings!  I loved the toasted buns, nice touch.

Also got the potato teezers with ranch, they were so tasty I wanted to grab another order to go!

The main reason I stopped here today was because I heard their seasonal milkshake was back....pumpkin baby!  I'm a sucker for all things pumpkin and was more than happy to try out their milkshake.  At first I was a little taken aback by the small size of it....until I tried sucking it through the straw.  Holy thickness batman!  You definitely don't need any more than what they give you, I probably could have turned that thing upside-down and it would have stayed put right in the cup.

So, minus the little fiasco with the cheeseburger, Swensons definitely will get more business from me, especially when I have guests in the city again!"}
{"text":"For shame new Swensons! For shame! This is not the Galley Boy that I've known for over 25 years (the burgers used to look like the menu picture) and this location is too new to for the presentation to be so poor. It looks like a McDonalds cheeseburger with heavy mayo and it taste like it had been sitting under a heating lamp. 
The service was fast, teasers hot, banana shake good, but the Galley Boy...how does the specialty item not be the best part of the meal? Definitely won't be back anytime soon. There is a 5 Guys a few lights down and they've yet to disappoint. 
Do better new Swensons. Do better!"}
{"text":"This is like stepping into a time machine and going back 40 years ago.

The burgers are good - better than fast food, but probably not as good as the true-blue burger joints - at a very reasonable price.  I had the double cheeseburger and wife had the galley boy.  The buns are toasted which was a nice touch.  Both of us enjoyed our selection.

My chocolate milkshake was the real deal and as others have said, the potato teezers are legit.

The service was fantastic.  The young man helping us was very nice and constantly sprinting to and from the cars that pulled up.

Excellent throwback that will receive my business again!"}
{"text":"Swenson's is an Ohio Institution of deliciousness! Open year around but it's a summer fav for me with great food and always fantastic service!!"}
{"text":"Burgers and fried food sold by kids running around between the cars and expertly brought to you as ordered.  Absolutely delicious.  Thank you Akron for sharing this institution!"}
{"text":"My son and I went the week of the soft opening a and there were a few glitches in the service. Overall though, it was a solid Swensons experience. He got the Galley Boy, and I got a Cheeseburger with the works (No bacon or bbq sauce). The burgers were excellent, and the fries and onion rings were very hot, crispy, and delicious. Not a bad start Swensons, and I'm sure it will only get better. 

This is a fairly convenient location about 10 minutes West off the Cedar/Brainard exit for those traveling I-271."}
{"text":"Y'all, this place! It is one of the few things i missed when leaving NE Ohio. It's a drive in set up and super eager runners (yes literal runners) who run up as soon as you park. So make sure you know what you want or ask for a menu if you're a first timer!
I don't know about the Galley Boy (the burger they are famous for). I can't deal with the olive and the sauce on it. BUT. I get the cheeseburger with bacon lettuce tomato and mayo on it- divine!! And a side order of zucchini sticks (yum!) and usually one or two of my husband's order of potato teasers (kind of like jalape√±o poppers but cheesier!). And I finish it off with a delish shake- usually a mix of peanut butter and chocolate. It's so good, just trust me. Favorite burger by far in this area. Do yourself a favor and get you some Swenson's!"}
{"text":"My cousin took me here on a recent trip to Cleveland because she claimed they have the best onion rings ever. And she was right!! They really are the best. Service is quick because the employees literally run to your car to take your order and bring your food. When you come here, it's like taking a step back in time in a good way. They intend for you to sit and eat your meal in your car and even have the equipment to attach a tray to your rolled down window. I can't wait to come back the next time I come to town!"}
{"text":"I am an Akron native, now in Cincinnati, and am so blessed at how much better the food is here. But there is one place that I miss, because it simply has no rival down here, and it is Swenson's. 

I have been known to make the twenty minute drive from home to Swenson's just for their burger, and it's without hesitation. Their burgers overall are amazing, but if it's your first time, you have to get their signature galley boy. It's two patties with two sauces(a barbecue-ish sauce and a tarter-ish sauce) and the combo is killer.

I like to get that and potato teasers(poppers, basically) and a grape milkshake. Their shakes are fantastic, but I can't get past the grape one. I did try a mint-chocolate one last time though and it rocked my world. 

I unfortunately will be even further from Akron when I go to Spain, therefore unable to eat Swenson's, and I will honestly miss this place whenever I want a burger."}
{"text":"As much as I hate living in the city of Cleveland and as much as I can't wait to get out of here the second I graduate from school, there surely is one thing I'll truly miss about this place: Swensons. To say that their burgers are the best I've ever had is just putting it too simply. You'll crave them. You'll ponder what makes them so darn good; is it the rumored brown sugar they put in the hamburger meat? Is it the melted Velveeta cheese they use instead of the average american? Is it the fact they toast and butter the buns just prior to assembling? I'll just guess it's all of the above. While this is the nearest location to my house, as they originated in Akron and that's where most of them are, I will gladly make the drive to fulfill my cheeseburg craving.

When you first drive up to any one of the restaurants, you'll be transported back about 60 years, minus the roller skates and poodle skirts.  Servers here will run (and do I mean RUN) to your car, both when greeting and when serving. I've never seen a server that works there walk to a car, so you know they mean business. They are also very efficient and timely; I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes for a meal, even with four people accompanying me, and I've never had anything missing or wrong with any orders. That's dedication if you ask me.

My last meal on Earth? A plain Swenson's double cheeseburg, potato teezers (delicious jalapeno popper-like potato wedges) with ranch, and a California (grape juice, ginger ale, and their famous crushed ice). Thank goodness summer is approaching because that could only mean one thing; extended hours. Ahh yes."}
{"text":"This is a great idea to take the kids and family to. The food is good. The staff are wonderful. They treat you like family, just like you are at home."}
{"text":"Great burgers...skip the fries and get a shake instead."}
{"text":"Swensons makes everything OK. Bad day? Shit hitting the fan? A visit to Swensons makes it all OK. This place is good for the soul. I absolutely love the Galley Boy and even have the Galley Boy t-shirt. Eat this stuff in moderation though. Health food it is not. That being said, Swensons is delicious. Old time car service is always exceptional. Staff really hustles. Open late too, which is great. Wish I was in Akron right now!"}
{"text":"Swensons is an establishment in Akron but new to the Cleveland area, so when it opened up I had to give it a try. It lives up to the hype! The galley boy is a double cheeseburger with two \"special sauces\"-- one BBQ, one reminiscent of tartar sauce. Sounds weird, but it's delicious! The patties are thin but cooked perfectly, so despite their size they're juicy and tasty.

Branching out from burgers, they have excellent fries, onion rings and zucchini fries (what I've tried so far). You also can't go wrong with their milkshakes; peanut butter was amazing and raspberry, a seasonal special, was very good as well.

Prices are a little bit higher than McDonalds and the like, but the quality is much better. It's a drive-in, and run very well-- they're super efficient and the employees are friendly and helpful.

I'm going to go there: In-N-Out's got nothing on Swensons."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Swensons in over ten years until yesterday, and am glad to see it has changed little.

Comparing Swensons to the big three hamburger chains isn't fair, as Swensons is genuinely good food versus the processed garbage the chains try to pass off as food.

In particular we loved the onion rings and milkshakes.

And it's a delight to watch the car hops work!  These kids very literally run in getting to the cars, at times competing to see who gets there first.  It's wonderful to see how management finds kids with such excellent work ethics."}
{"text":"Good stuff here.  The best drive up restaurant in the world!

Get any burger and onion rings!"}
{"text":"Just like we like em. Went on grand opening day. Called in an order for 5. No mistakes. The giveaway for grand opening?  A 2017 calendar. Should have taken away a star for that but the food was really yummy, hot, ready, and correct!  See you again soon."}
{"text":"Ordered fried mushrooms and the Salad Boy with griddled onions  to go (again). Fried mushrooms were perfect as was the Salad boy this time! 

Management was very responsive to my previous 3 star review,reaching out to find out how things could be better. 5* experience this time!"}
{"text":"If you've visited The Rubber City, or stayed with friends, or lived there, or were born with tire treads instead of finger prints, you know about Swenson's, and you know about Skyway.  There are only two possibilities, for your drive-in burger, fry, onion ring and shake addiction, and, usually by birth, you already know where you stand.

\"Dad, could we go to...\"  It was either Swenson's.   OR...  it was Skyway.  Nobody, and I really do mean nobody, said, \"Hey, instead of Skyway, let's give Swenson's a try tonight, huh?\"  You would be drawn, quartered, and forced to sing the Michigan fight song, while slathered in Aqua-Velva and left to fend for yourself at a picnic table outside a Lawson's store.

So, I was born into a Skyway family.  That was it, you didn't have a choice.  

Then, that Galley Boy popped up out of the alley, whispering, \"Here.  Taste this...  the first one's free...  come on.  TRUST me...\"

It was all over.  The hook was set, the line tightened, and the only thing left was the carhop reeling me in, ready for my weekly Galley Boy, bowl of chili, tall cola.  Damn.  I just ate there about four hours ago, and if not for the snow, I'd drive right back there now.

(I nearly took a star off for the unbelieveably feng-shui-challenged location of this place.  It looks like they lost the lottery when the retail space was doled out in the Great Montrose Money-Sucking Strip Mall Megachurch From Hell.  They at least have a few pine trees in the parking lot, but it is pretty damned awful.  I don't think that's really Swenson's fault, so I left all five stars.)

(I had to update this review:  Wax bags.  They hand you your \"to-go\" food in WAXED bags.  How perfect is that, on a scale of one to PERFECT?  When was the last time anyone handed you food in waxed paper?  Were you listening to the latest hit from Frankie and Annette?  Were you helping your Dad dig the Cold War bunker?  Dig that waxed bag.  That's just so, so... SwenSATIONal.)"}
{"text":"Always good, always consistent. Stow-Kent is top tier of all the Swenson's locations. Definitely recommend a chocolate-banana milkshake and Cajun French Fries (well-done)."}
{"text":"This  review is based upon our first and only visit to a Swensons Drive-In. It occurred on a Sunday afternoon, sometime around 5pm. Another side note, I didn't grow up with Swensons so this review isn't laced with nostalgia or childhood fondness like my review of Elyria's Oh Boy burgers. I was just a guy, sitting in a car in front of a burger joint, waiting for it to put meat of unknown origins into my face. 

So here's the schtick. It's a drive-in that serves throwback burgers and fried things to you while you sit in your car. The food is very cheap (a basic cheeseburger is only $2.45) and probably among the worst things you can put into your body nutritionally speaking, of course. I'm not saying that as a knock, I'm just saying that unless you want to die of a massive coronary at 50 you probably shouldn't eat here all that often. Moving on.

Since drive-ins essentially died out with the Nixon administration, there's a bit of a learning curve here for anyone under the age of 60 that hasn't experienced one before.

Swenson's 101:
1. Enter the parking lot
2. Pull into a space, preferably facing the main building.
3. Turn on your headlights to let them know you want service.
4. As soon as the car-hop blitzkriegs your vehicle, either ask for a menu or rattle off your order.
5. Turn off your lights. The car hop will place a tag under your windshield wiper indicating you've been helped.
6. Wait for your order to be delivered.
7. Eat

The flagship burger is called the Galley Boy. It's basically a double cheeseburger served on a buttered/toasted wheat-ish bun with tartar sauce on top and BBQ sauce on the bottom. I'm pretty sure it's written somewhere that everyone that does Swensons should have one at least once.

The Good: 
As others have mentioned, the prices here are low. I'd say they're on par with chain fast food. Less than $5 for a cheeseburger and fries.
I'll admit it. The food is damn good. How can it not be? It's loaded with everything that the American brain has been trained to crave since the 50s. I'm talking ridiculously tasty hamburgers and fried things that seem genetically engineered to hit every dopamine receptor in your brain with a speed and ferocity typically reserved for something you'd smoke out of a small, glass pipe. Seriously, it's food that'll have you floating to Valhalla on a cloud of mystery meat, fluffy buns and ketchup-covered bits of fried goodness.
The Potato Teezers are insanely addictive. They're like tater tots but filled with cheese and little bits of jalapeno peppers. Dip these bad boys in ranch dressing and you're basically gonna have to ask someone to cut you off because you won't be able to of your own free will.

I know, I make it sound so good. So why only 3-stars? Basically, it just didn't do all that much for me. Here are some of the highlights.

The Not-So-Good: 
Styrofoam cups? Really? It's 2016, man. Nobody should be using Styrofoam anything, especially in the food industry. Ditch the foam, people.
It's not all that fast. Sure the teenage guys high tail it out to your car as soon as you pull in, asking you for your order before you've even shifted into park, but after that, the wait is on. It took 20 minutes from the time our order was taken until we were eating. Not cool, man. Not cool.
The burgers, buns, sauces, pretty much everything is loaded with sugar. I'll admit, I'm pretty sensitive to sugar since I go out of my way to avoid the stuff, but damn. The sauces on the Galley Boy could probably be used as ice cream toppings.
There's not all that much shade in the open parking lot. This means that unless you leave your car running with the AC on, another not-so-environmentally-responsible ding, you'll probably be hot as balls.

As a man slightly north of 40, I look back fondly on the days of my youth. Growing up as a kid in the 80s I remember a time when McDonald's wasn't a bad word, soft drinks weren't the devil in liquid form and terms like \"paleo\" and \"trans fats\" weren't even a part of the American lexicon. I grew up on Taco Bell, Burger Chef, and Kentucky Fried Chicken (that's what KFC was called before it was deemed to difficult to expect people to say all three words of their name). What I'm trying to say is that I'm as guilty of waxing nostalgic about joints like this as anyone else. But let's be honest. I didn't grow up with drive-ins, they're a relic of the 50s and 60s so chances are you didn't either.

For me, eating food at places like Swensons is a bit like being a social smoker. You know it's bad for you, but you also know that doing it only a few times a year probably won't do all that much damage and while you're doing it you actually like it. It's a calculated risk, right? So, that's what this is. Greasy, sugary, mouth-wateringly good food that will probably cause those of us that choose to regularly eat healthy foods some short-term intestinal distress. The runs may pass, but the memories will last a lifetime."}
{"text":"It's Swensons.  Come here expecting great food and an unhealthy meal.  I recommend the Galley Boy (or two) and some Potato Teazers with ranch on the side.  They charge extra for it, but it is what it is.  Every flavor of milkshake I've gotten from there over the years has been great as well, but adding one of those to the above order will put you into a food coma.  Proceed at your own risk."}
{"text":"THEY RUN OUT TO YOUR CAR. Not a jog...a SPRINT. Got the olive-garnished galley boy...squirting full of sauce. Patties are small, bun looks like it got punched in the face and the fries are crisp and greasy. Overall good, although my dining partner insists they've lost their magic. For me it was classic america."}
{"text":"If it's good enough for LeBron it's good enough for me.   

I have been visiting family in Cleveland since I was a kid and cannot believe they had never taken me here before!

It's like a local Sonic - but better.  

The potato teasers were insanely yummy - like a jalapeno popper - but just add potato and way better.

We got two shakes and while we were chugging them down we realized they brought us the wrong ones.  They figured it out before we could tell them and fixed it in no time - even though we would have gladly finished them off. 

But I was glad to have my combo of mint and chocolate shake.  SO GOOD. 

Next time I'll go when I have more of an appetite and tackle the rest of the menu for sure."}
{"text":"Great, fast, and delicious drive in! The car attendants still run to the cars and extremely attentive!"}
{"text":"Swensons is an Akron institution, and they have multiple locations in the area. Definitely a guilty pleasure for delicious burgers and sides (my favorite is the onion rings). The burgers taste great, with any toppings combination you choose. The service is very fast, efficient and friendly.  Definitely an old school style, but the food is consistent no matter which location you visit. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Finally!!! A late night place in University Heights you can get food at. The burgers are amaze balls and the peanut butter shake is incredible. They also make a mean grilled cheese!! You wait about 30-45 minutes sometimes depending on how busy it is but the food is always perfect. It's nice for when you want decent burgers but don't want to sit down at a restaurant. Never lukewarm or like it's been sitting out for awhile. The servers/runners are alway really nice and efficient. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"First impressions: the waiters literally sprinting from car to car was simultaneously hilarious and unsettling. The food is a good deal for the amount you get, but pretty typical tasting for drive-in food. It was unanimous almost us, though, that the shakes were pretty tasty. 

Service: ***** (although it made us nervous)
Food (quality): ***
Food (quantity): ****
Shakes: ****"}
{"text":"I went for the hype. Honestly, I think you'll get a lot of 5 star reviews because Swenson's has a cult following, but from an objective standpoint, it's just an above-average burger joint. The drive-in concept is gimmicky to me, and frankly, doesn't always make sense in Cleveland. Do I really want to keep my windows down so you can stick a tray on my car while it's snowing?? Pass.

I had a burger with onion rings and a shake. The burger had that nice soft bun so you can really compress your burger together - I liked that. The onion rings were just onion rings in my opinion. The shake was good, but I can get the same for much cheaper at Steak-n-Shake. 

Final verdict: This is the NE Ohio version of In-N-Out Burger, but it's a drive through."}
{"text":"No matter how much fine-dining experience I may get, no five-star, three-$$$ restaurant will ever get me as excited as a classic Drive-In restaurant like Swenson's.  I'm not from around these parts, but I can totally see Swenson's as the quintessential high-school hang-spot, and I'm quite jealous my hometown doesn't have anything quite like it.  The Galley Boy was delicious, although it did catch me a bit off guard when their \"special sauce\" was more along the lines of BBQ, as opposed to your typical 1000 Island.  Also, had myself some GREAT onion rings (lightly breaded, homeade) and a refreshing Californian (great invention!).  The crowned jewel of our meal here, however, were the potato teasers.  Think jalepeno popper/tater tot/cheese stick and you might get close to dreaming of the deliciousness of these bad boys.  My entire meal at Swenson's was absolutely great, but if I had to single out one MUST try, get yourself some potato teasers!!!!"}
{"text":"Always delicious. The servers get really close to your car when you're pulling in so be careful, I was afraid I was going to run this kid over. We got gallyboy burgers and a small fry. I heard you need to get the potato puffs.

They were really busy and it was cold and rainy so our food took a little longer than I expected. But our server was very nice."}
{"text":"Dropped by this place to get a burger and shake after a long day of flying and visiting with family.  It is a drive-up diner place.  The boys running around (literally running, no roller skates here) take your orders and deliver your food and help you with anything else you need.  Make sure your windows can roll down otherwise you will be getting your food to go and not taking advantage of the old school vibe of hanging the food tray on the window. 

First off, don't be a rookie and turn off your lights when you park. The boys rely on lights to let them know if you need something. Made that rookie mistake, didn't the second time. That's right, liked this place so much that I had to go back the very next day.  

Ordered the Galley boy burger, potato teezers with a side of ranch, fries, and a hot fudge+peanut butter shake. 
The potato teezers are fried potato, cheese, and jalape√±os. Good flavor and crispy texture. The ranch which you should order goes with it well.  Fries are fries, nothing crazy about it but they are good nonetheless and come on if you get a burger you need some fries. Am I right?

Now for the galley boy burger.  This is a must order.  The burger is delicious and the meat tastes pretty darn fresh (not frozen). The special sauces are: one is a BBQ flavor that's a little sweet and not; the second sauce looks like a  tartar sauce but definitely doesn't taste like one. It is like mayo with melted cheese and some kind of herb.  The bread is crispy around the edges from the flattop and gives the texture the burger needs. I have eaten many burgers in many places and This burger is one of my faves. 
With all of this totally \"healthy\" food you need a beverage to wash it down right? So the hot fudge+peanut butter shake made total sense to me. This shake did not disappoint. It was soooo good. Not too thick and not too runny, it was just right. How good you ask? I'll just say the wife told me I have to get my own next time because she is not sharing! 

Wish I could franchise this place in the NW!"}
{"text":"Swanson's is such a local landmark that my son moved all the way back from Seattle just to be able to get a Galley Boy! If you haven't had one yet, you don't know what you're missing! I'd try something else, but I like them so much! Especially with a side of deep fried mushrooms.i know...not the healthiest food on the planet, but so good! This summer they have a peach shake that's so creamy and fruity. Yum!"}
{"text":"Swensons is the kind of place where locals wax historical poetic, and an outsider like me thinks it's 'good'. 

I went with the Galley Boy, some onion rings and a chocolate peanut butter shake.  All 'good'.  The burger had two sauces - neither sauce was woohoo to me."}
{"text":"I was looking to get a burger and was in the area, the yelp reviews were good on this place so I gave it a shot and boy did it live up to the hype! 

When you first pull in it's kind of confusing because you think it's a drive thru but then quickly realize that it's a drive up. I sat there for a min to survey just what the hell was going on...people flashing lights, waiters running through the parking lot like track athletes...wth? lol...it was hilarious. But have no fear, there is a large sign that reads \"turn your lights on for service\". It took about 5 mins to get a waiter but I wasn't upset because I was watching the guy run around, he was working hard. When he came to the window he was a young guy, very polite and took the time to explain the menu to me and how to order, etc. 

After surveying the menu, I noticed that things were pretty cheap in comparison to what other places might be. I flicked the lights on and waited. I decided to order a regular cheeseburger, a galley boy, tots and a pumpkin shake. Everything was full of flavor, hot and amazing! The galley boy comes with 2 different sauces. After I ate everything I was sitting there waiting for my bill...annnnnnddddd....I ordered another galley boy annnnnnddddd a chocolate pb milkshake. Yup, I ate ALOT. 

Interesting place to watch how things operate and the food, awesome!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Swensons!! I just wish they'd put in a picnic table so in the summer months motorcycle go-ers have somewhere to sit!!"}
{"text":"Not much to say about swensons except that it's so good!! It's kinda like the In N Out of Ohio..like you can't get it on the west coast but once you've had it you always want it. Have to get a burger!! Have to! And a peanut butter shake. YOURE. WELCOME. 


Little place, servers come out to your car, you eat in your car or take it to go."}
{"text":"I love the Galley Boy.  It's probably one of my favorite burgers.  Also got a mint shake, that was also fantastic.  I always tip the runners because they literally run from car to car.  

The food is always fresh and made to order.  Good cheap eats."}
{"text":"If it were owned by Ducks and Geese, it'd be Swansons. If it were owned by hopeless romantics, it'd be Swoonsons. And if it were owned by people who cuss a lot, it'd be Swornsons. But it's not, so let's get on with the review.

What to get: A Galley Boy!
What not to get: Infections or rashes from an Alley Boy.
Are you saying you've gotten those: No comment.

If it were owned by pigs, it'd be Swinesons.

This Swenson's location is in Stow, and it's the kind of burger you'd Stow away on a vessel for, for months at a time. I'm not the world's biggest fan of fast food-type burgers unless they're made to perfection. Very few are - and Swenson's Galley Boy absolutely is. It may well be the best fast food burger in the world... and many of those who have tried it will agree with me.

If it were owned by Michael Phelps, it'd be Swimsons.

There are many locations throughout NE Ohio, and I've tried most of them. The service at this location isn't always great, but I come for the food. The burgers here are otherworldly. Make sure you get the Galley Boy, and make sure you eat it while it's piping hot. These things are always served up piping hot, burn-your-mouth-hot, so make sure you take advantage of that the way that one ex took advantage of you two summers ago.

If it were in a medical testing facility, it'd be Swabsons.

It's basically a melty gooey cheesy saucy burger on what seems to be brioche, with tasty thin-patty meat (double), and something that is sort of like McDonald's Big Mac sauce but much better on it. It comes wrapped in foil with an olive on a toothpick stuck in the top. A delicious green olive, no less. These things are dirt cheap (like, under $3) and hearty. Two of them will fill you up, one is perfect for a snack.

If it were owned by muscle dudes and muscle girls, it'd be Swolesons. Or maybe Sweatsons.

Drinks are interesting, but hypersweet. Their chocolate shakes are not bad at all. Their \"Florida\" and \"California\" drinks are mixtures of all your fave sodas. The Florida is actually pretty good although it gives me a headache from too much HFCS (High Fructose Corn Syrup). They're worth a try, but don't make a habit of it. I like that they are innovative though. Top marks for that.

If it were a mouthwash manufacturer, it'd be Swillsons.

It's a drive-in. Turn your lights on for service. Turn them off when you don't need service. The service at Swenson's is 50's style, with young adults and tweens running from car to car to take and deliver orders, and yelling out what the orders are as per company policy. Tip them - it can't be easy to run around and yell the way they have to. I'm sure it's a confidence-builder though.

If it were a high school where people's heads got stuck in toilet bowls, it'd be Swirliesons.

One thing that Swenson's doesn't do well is getting your food out quickly. Sometimes it's speedy as a Gonzalez, but at other times it might be 15 mins for a burger. So be prepared for that, and know that it will be worth the wait.

And if it were a place where you go with your significant other to partner swap and watch freaky people getting it on, it'd be Swingersons. It wouldn't make you nervous, if anything you'd be restless, because you've been around and you've seen it all. Then at home you'd get the munchies, but not for twinkies. Instead, you'd want a Galley Boy. And I don't mean an actual boy. Though if you're anything like me, you want that too. Which is yet another thing common you and I both have in common with Tove Lo."}
{"text":"Come here for the Galley Boy. Not for the Girlie Boy. If you want a Girlie Boy, then I'm available this weekend for half hour specials.

I needed a keeper for my football (soccer) team. Came here and asked for a Goalie Boy. Ended up with an amazing burger.

These things are always served up piping hot, burn-your-mouth-hot, so make sure you take advantage of that the way that one ex took advantage of you two summers ago.

I wanted a guy who uses a ton of hair product. Came here and asked for a Gelly Boy. Ended up with an amazing burger.

Wanted a tall, lanky, skinny dude. Came here and asked for a Gangly Boy. Ended up with an amazing burger. Although I must say, there were several Gangly Boys working here as servers. If any of them want to reach me, they can message me at 1-800-GIRLIE-BOY."}
{"text":"Tips to a mind blowing meal at swensons.

1. Order a Galley Boy
2. Order the potato teasers with ranch to dip
3. Order a large California grape drink to wash it down.
4. Consume and experience nirvana

...Lebron James brought this burger on the letterman show for a reason. If its good enough for arguably the best basketball player in the world (traitor or not) then its good for you too. I get the same 3 things listed above every time and will continue to do so for a very, very, long time. 

(They also do doggie burgers if you bring a furry friend with you)"}
{"text":"This is just a great family and friend hang out.  The food is amazing and very reasonable.  My family and I after a baseball tournament went and we loved the way the staff run to your call every time you want to
Order.  The shakes rock and the specialty burger was spot on.  My wife loves the fried
Bologna sandwich."}
{"text":"I was not in love with the cheeseburger or the raspberry milkshake that the servers were raving about! I have heard so many things about Swensons and was not impressed by any means! It was also confusing on who was helping you as there were just heaps of high school boys running around taking orders from peoples cars. If you need something quick or a reminder of how things were in the 50's this might be a good place."}
{"text":"My first job was at Swenson's West in Akron in the early 1980s. The food is just as delicious now as it was then--best burgers ever. Also, I love the new Cleveland Heights location. Now I don't have to wait until I go to Akron to get my fix!"}
{"text":"The best burger joint in all of Ohio, I only wish they had more locations throughout Ohio so more people can enjoy the food! Just a simple juicy burger with a toasted bun and sweet taste can satisfy me and its affordable price makes it even better! I usually buy the regular burgers and thier Galleyboys, oh how they make my mouth water! It's a very fun place to eat as a midnight snack with your friends and as a meal for yourself, I highly suggest you stop by if you haven't yet or you're missing out on what could be the ultimate foodie experience!"}
{"text":"Cadillacs...Cheeseburgers...and Summer!

It's been years since I've had a Swenson's Cheeseburger! I'd like to use this franchise in a movie I'm making called \"The Summer I'll Never Forget\" where Leroy and his friends dig-up Summer Memories and add new ones along the way.

One scene, Leroy and his friends drive in their Summermobile (It's a Cadillac ElDorado) looking for a cruise-in around Parma. They get hungry and go to Swenson's...please don't let this franchise go!"}
{"text":"A staple of my childhood/high school memories, Swensons goes down as one of my favorite spots back home. Whether it was late night after a football game or just a lovely Saturday afternoon, this spot was a perfect hangout with a group of friends and your classic greasy deliciousness. Also, their milkshakes in the summer always hit the spot.

IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN HERE: the Galley Boy is a must. Special sauces that great this sweetness on a burger is just cosmic. All the fried sides are a perfect company with it as well.

My typical order: jalapeno poppers with ranch, large California, and a Galley Boy"}
{"text":"1st Swensons visit was ok.  It didn't meet the hype that all of my Akron friends put on it.  The galley boy is good and the shakes are also pretty good, but it's far from the best food in the world.  Maybe the hidden secret ingredient for a great Swensons trip is nostalgia, but for an outsider like me, it was just pretty good."}
{"text":"Excellent service Jorden S..  Great BLT!! Clean restrooms and friendly service.  Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Great food and fast service. Very hot and muggy day. I'm impressed that the employees didn't slow down running to all the cars."}
{"text":"Super quick service! They are literally running around! Very fun for a summer afternoon! Drive in style, super affordable!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! I am not a huge fan of fast food, but this place is unique.  You park there and the food is brought to your car.  They place a tray on your car window or you can bring the tray into the car.  The staff literally sprint to your car every time so while it seems dangerous at times, it is also entertaining.   The boys and girls have always been friendly and clearly efficient.

The food - where do I start?  I love the salad boy! A veggie burger with their special sauces with all the regular fixings!  It's actually quite large and I have to rise to the challenge to finish all of it.  Their potato teezers are also a favorite - cheese potato and jalapeno in a fried coating...can't go wrong with that!   My husband gets the Galley Boy each time - never heard him complain.  They also have milkshakes and special orange drinks, called Florida and California.  

Swensons is just a fun place to grab a quick dinner and have a different experience. And no, it's not like Sonic because that place is not nearly as awesome.

I kindly make a plea to the owner of Swensons to open up a location on the west side of Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Swensons is a must stop if you are in the Akron, Ohio area. Drive up burger joint with great burgers, milk shakes and fried delectables such as the \"potato teezers\" one of my favorites. Must get the Galley Boy it's a double cheese burger with there special sauce. Great service good drive in food and you wont be let down."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Everything on the menu is fantastic. You haven't lived until you've had the Galley Boy, aka, best burger EVER."}
{"text":"The only thing good here is the Florida.. The cheeseburgers are crap... Wish there was a in-n-out over here :("}
{"text":"We had great service and Delicious food.  The wait staff ran their keisters off taking our order and serving our food!  They were very polite and helpful!"}
{"text":"This was my first (and only) experience at a drive-in. You just pull up in your car, someone comes up to you to take your order, and you wait for your food and go. My friend recommended this place when we wanted to go to Steak n Shake. After trying it, I realized Swensons is better! The Galley Boy burger was amazing and their milkshakes are just as good! This place is quite a long drive from University Circle but everything is super inexpensive and tastes great!"}
{"text":"I moved from Ohio years ago and this is always my first stop when I come home. I like to think of this as the \"In-n-Out\" of Ohio. The Galleyboy was just as I remembered!"}
{"text":"If your favorite part of a burger is the special sauce (like a McDonald's Big Mac), the Galley Boy at Swensons is the burger to try.  The burger has a generous helping of the creamy and slightly sweet sauce added to a regular double cheeseburger.  After the special sauce, though, the Galley Boy and the other burgers at Swensons don't have much going for them:  The thin patties are a bit dried out (admittedly difficult to have a patty that is both thin and juicy) and don't really have any distinctive taste in and of themselves.  The buns are pretty standard but toasted, at least, which is nice.  I tried one of the regular burgers just to be sure, and it confirmed that it's really the special sauce that masks the burger's shortfalls and turns it into something that is pretty decent.  The Potato Teezers side was pretty good--very cheesy with just a little bit of jalapeno kick in each stick.

I tried Swensons based on an argument with a friend while we were chowing down on my beloved Cook-Out burgers in North Carolina (at about 3:00am on Saint Patrick's Day to fully set the scene).  The burgers at Swensons are a long way from that rarefied air in my opinion, and I would put them also behind In-n-Out, Five Guys, and Culver's among the national/regional chains I've tried.  Still, the Galley Boy at Swensons is a decent enough special sauce burger, and it's fun to watch the runners zip back and forth from the kitchen to the cars in the parking lot.  Now excuse me while I try to clean the crumbs out of my car."}
{"text":"Words cannot describe the joygasm that this establishment gives me though I will try. Delicious. Scrumptious. Tasty. Delightful. Sinfully amazing. I've never been one to believe in true love but the galley boy changed my mind. I could live at this palace of joy and if I become homeless one day I can promise you I will. The trees in the back of the lot look like they give good protection from the elements. I'm pretty sure even dumpster diving for their scraps would give me a better meal than most restaurants."}
{"text":"I recently moved out of state, and Swensons is always my first go-to whenever I come back to Cleveland. My order has been the same for over 10 years, and it never gets old. Best burger in town."}
{"text":"The drive here from Warren was horrendous.  I will never drive through Kent again.  That said, the food here is really good.  I had the Galley Boy which has 2 patties, cheese, and 2 sauces (one like tomato relish and one like tartar).  The onion rings were spot on and the Potato Teezers are perfect with a good jalape√±o flavor and just a little heat.  The shake was much better than the California or Florida we had last time (basically ginger ale with different syrups added depending on Fla or Cal, and both are too sweet).  Watching the smiling college kids working there run in and out back and forth was amusing and just a little creepy at the same time.

I recommend the drive in but go to a different location unless you are in Kent already."}
{"text":"If you're from California, like me, then the way they take your order and bring your food out to you is incredibly stressful.  What?  It's a Drive In? You gotta flash your lights?  You have to wait for them to run full speed to your car? You have to know fancy burger lingo?  You have to make actual eye contact?  Listen to me.  That is literally THE ONLY THING SOMEONE COULD COMPLAIN ABOUT REGARDING THIS RESTAURANT.

It's inexpensive.  There's a wide variety.  The employees are kind.  It's well-known.  And above all, it's tantalizingly mouthwatering delicious.

I have family in Cleveland.  Family I've been visiting frequently since 2007, and every time since I was first exposed to this haven I DEMAND to be taken here.  It's a burger that must be devoured.  So yes, person reading this Yelp review, go.  Order something.  They're the best.

Oh, and one more thing before I go.  Do yourself a favor, order a side of Potato Teezers, and eat the hell out of them."}
{"text":"swensons is one of the best places ive ever tried im from the west coast so we had nothing like it there but it was one thing i wouldnt mind getting fat on!!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best burger joints in the area."}
{"text":"Love Swensons!   Their burgers are great and their service is always fast and efficient.  The newest location in University Heights is as good as the Akron locations.  Love just a cheeseburger with grilled onions and tater teasers!"}
{"text":"I mainly get the same thing every time I come here, the galley boy. It's so delicious how can I pass it up?  I've also gotten tots with it. Both were awesome and the galley boy is the best fast food restaurant burger ever, yes even better than a double double at in n out burger"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with this burger and I was starving when I ate it, so there wasn't any bias and I should have loved it, but I didn't.

Much hyped around these parts, they have awesome service where they take your order at your car. Menu is basic burger place stuff and not expensive.

The burger itself reminds me of a high school cafeteria one, didn't seem high quality for whatever reason and wasn't seasoned well. Wasn't my thing, but others seem to enjoy it."}
{"text":"The best burgers ever are made here. It makes me feel joy tasting the burgers, teasers, and milk shakes.  The employees sprint to your car in a manner of urgency, as if you may be having a baby and they know exactly what to do to help you. Except they don't. They just know how to give you complete happiness wrapped in paper with a side of joy and a tall glass of satisfaction. Do yourself a favor and never eat anywhere else."}
{"text":"Swensons is my favorite burger place in Akron Ohio for sure! I always get a strawberry banana shake, a cheeseburger, and onion rings but, I never finish. All of there waiters are very nice and very quick. The prices are low and the food is great!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for the first time. I ordered a cheeseburger and onion rings and my husband had the double cheeseburger and fries. We loved everything, although the fries could've used a little more deep frying. The taste of the burgers were perfect!!  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"What don't I love about this place? This place is great, rain or shine these kids run out to your car and deliver your food with a smile. Not only is the service good but the food is even better, whatever cheese they use on the burgers is amazing and the fries are superb. Everyone should try Swensons!"}
{"text":"What a fun place! Food is pretty good and really cheap! They run to your car like the old fashion drive ins! The staff is always quick and very friendly. They even have a huge smile on their faces in the rain! I would highly recommend one of their milkshakes. They come in all different flavors! So yummy! Absolutely a Cleveland Classic!"}
{"text":"My headlights bring all the boys to the yard. Lol but seriously this place replaces any In n Out cravings you have in Ohio. Their signature burger was super juicy (double sauce doozy) and you MUST GET their potato teezers- they're essentially McDonald hashbrowns infused with jalape√±o and melted cheese. WAAOH!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, disgusting salads. I get it. This place is about the cheeseburgers but when you're taking the kids out it's nice that there are healthier options but I'd had a fuller belly had I ordered with them. Tried eating the one thing that looked ok, the chicken, but it was chewy like fat. Old, disgusting and if they are keeping old ingredients for one menu option they are probably keeping old ones for others."}
{"text":"There are only four things to know about Swensons:

-the burgers are great. like so good I think they might be singlehandledly keeping in-and-out out of CLE for fear of competition?
-the boys are cute
-the burgers don't come with lettuce, tomatoes etc. unless you ask for them
-if you're not getting a galley boy and potato teasers, you're doing it wrong. 

I'm not really an eat in your car kind of girl, but for this burger? I'd eat standing. The Galley Boy is the only way to go, and you definitely should add some vegetables to that! Carmelized onions, lettuce and tomato are my recommendations! The milkshakes and french fries are overshadowed by the burger and they're sort of do without in my opinion. BUT OH MY LORD THOSE POTATO TEASERS. CHEESE. JALAPE√ëO. INSIDE A TATER TOT AND FRIED. Please don't make the mistake I made when Swensons finally became accessible to my East side life and not order them. For the love of food in Cleveland, get the potato teasers man! 

This is in my opinion the very best way to spend a cheat day in the land."}
{"text":"The burgers here are AMAZING!! It was a bit unclear that all of the toppings had to be ordered separately, but the burger was still great. The French fries are average and the milkshakes are mediocre, but the burgers are fantastic and the service is very fast and attentive."}
{"text":"Mmmm galley boy and onion rings. I was reluctant to like this place because of all the fanboys and girls hyping it up, but it actually is really good. I can't lie. And the service is impressive-- these kids RUN."}
{"text":"Tried this place today for the first time and I'm impressed. Talk about the staff hustling, they were fast and on their game with pleasant attitudes. I got a cheeseburger, onion rings and a chocolate shake. The burger was ok but next time will get a double for the meat patty is not large, and will get one with more items added. The onion rings were delicious and the shake was even better. It was a very nice size of 16 ounces for $3.10 and thick. I will be going back soon to try other menu items for they offer a lot. I was glad to leave a tip."}
{"text":"Galley boy, potatoe teasers w/ ranch, and an extra large Strawberry Mt. Dew or peanut butter shake, you're welcome."}
{"text":"I give this joint 3 stars for the concept, great service, and sugar burgers are their thing, yup that's what they serve. The galley boy, sugar burger with sweet mirlicle whip type stuff and sickly sweet BBQ sauce. If you like this type of thing, then by all means. My family absolutely loves this place; just one more reason I suspect I am adopted . I seemed to remember I liked this kind of thing when I was a fat little kid. I like my burgers meat flavored, with Chipotle flavored aoli(mayo), maybe with some bacon, cheese, jalape√±os, grilled onions and shrooms.    Do you crave  high glycimic, diabetes inducing burgers this is right up your alley. Otherwise stick to 5 Guys, In and Out(where applicable) or McDonald's."}
{"text":"This is not just a \"burger\" place.  You enter the lot, leave on your lights, and a young guy (car hop) comes to you with a menu.  First time in over fifty years that I have seen a car hop!  Their \"hamburgs\" (the old correct name for hamburgers) are terrific.  I ordered a half pounder that was med rare - and delicious.  Fries were classic.  Wifey got an egg salad sandwich, soup.  She enjoyed her food!  They have phosphates - soda syrup mixed with club soda.  The old malt shop style.  They also do Californias - using ginger ale as the base instead of club soda.  Hot fudge sundaes topped off the visit.

If you ever need anything - put your lights on.  The guys come running!

Groovy!  Right on Cedar St, right off of 271.  Mustard, pickles, onions (grilled!!!!!) are standard toppings.  Ask for ketchup and it's hamburg heaven!  Go if you wind up in University Heights near Cleveland.  If you live in Cleveland - go today!!  Swenson's rocks!"}
{"text":"Tried Swensons for the first time after having a couple glasses of Crown and it was def in point. The tots were perfectly crisp and my burger looked like hell but tasted like heaven. I threw a little bacon on there because (cliche moment) \"everything tastes better with bacon.\"
Swensons is cheap and good so I'll be back"}
{"text":"Are you even a real NE- Ohio-er if you don't love swensons? I love the potato teasers, and the service is always really great. Never been to one I felt like it wasn't"}
{"text":"A friend suggested we go here while visiting the Cleveland area for the weekend claiming that they have the best burger in the area we ordered:

1 hamburger, fries
1 hotdog, fries
1 galley burger, fries
1 salad burger and potato teezers

All of the burgers were really good, although salad burger sauce was  a bit sweet. Fries...meh. But, let me tell you...the potato teezers WERE AMAZING with some ranch to dip them in. So good that I think I dreamed of them last night!! YUM!

The service was amazing. These kids were literally RUNNING from car to car, back and forth in and out of the building."}
{"text":"Best hamburgers and sides anywhere.  Great service and value for the price.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The prices are about half what you pay at a chain restaurant,  and the burgers are twice as good."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Swenson's since I was a kid.  Hands down, the best burgers in Akron...anywhere, really.  For the money, you can't beat them!  If you've never tried them, you should!  They have half a dozen or so locations in the Akron Canton Cleveland area.  All are outstanding!"}
{"text":"This place has very good burgers and onion rings.    I am not a burger lover but when I have a craving this is the burger I want."}
{"text":"Love Swensons... since my first taste in 1993 to my last visit they are consistant and delicious."}
{"text":"This place is so hit or miss, unfortunately.

If it's not too crowded and they're staffed up, you'll have a five-star experience. A fun staff running out to your car to take your order, and coming back to deliver delicious juicy burgers, tasty shakes, and fries. A fun way to eat lunch or dinner on a sunny day with your car windows down and music playing.

But I more often have the flipside, one-star experience at this location. They're super crowded and super understaffed. Like last night... it took a long time for someone to get to our car for our order. It then took at least 20 minutes to get our order - which was wrong, and missing items we paid for. (And it wasn't a large order, food for two.) We then had to wait another frustratingly long period of time for someone to come back, and he ran off in the middle of us telling him what we were missing. After yet another long wait, we were about to just drive off when he came back with the rest of our order... which was hastily put together, so that the applesauce had spilled on everything. A sticky mess.

To top it off, the food wasn't up to the standards you hope for when you go to Swensons. The burgers were overcooked, yet somehow the fries were undercooked and basically still spuds. And we didn't even have the ketchup we requested to just smother them with tomato-masking goodness. At least the milkshakes were on point?

Bummer. It's just not worth the risk unless you have a lot of time to spare and you're not starving."}
{"text":"Best Burger Around! 

Usually I like a plain cheeseburger, but Swenson's has a magical sauce that I love. Try the Gallyboy, trust me, it's heaven. 

Love the quick, nice service too!"}
{"text":"Any burger - any food for that matter - that causes me to get a look of shock on my face followed by an \"Oh. My. God.\" after my first bite gets five stars. Period.

I was driving through the Akron area and found Swenson's on Yelp. I was skeptical because I'm not a diehard burger fan, but I've learned to respect the Yelpers. So...I got the Galley Boy and the onion rings.

Like the other reviewers said, right when I pulled up a kid sprinted - SPRINTED - to my car to take my order. Then he sprinted back inside. All of the staff - teens - were sprinting here and there. No strolling around or texting or chatting. 

Since going to this place a month ago I have started adopting a vegan diet. But at the risk of being judged by fellow vegans, I have to admit, if I'm near Akron? I'm getting a Galley Boy."}
{"text":"really good burgers good milkshakes. Stay away from the onion rings the nasty. Reminds me of Burger Kings. Only if they had hand breaded onion rings they be really good.. Too much crunch nana onion"}
{"text":"I know i know 3 stars is just average but let me tell you why. First ther service when you arrive back in to your space look at the menu online or park near it when your ready cut on your lights  and boom your waiter comes running for some direction.  Yes running to tour cars you will free pressure to order fast which I guess is normal. 2nd the food  any burger  fyi contains sugar in the meat mixture all the burgers  taste sweet . And come with no ketchup  on the burger it's self. Weird taste if u ask me. Our server got our drinks mixed up so we got our food but had to wait for our drinks . When  your done eating if staying  cut on your  lights and they take your tray  and trash. All in all not great the taste  meh...weird . But it was still pretty cool my shake was amazing  banana vanilla."}
{"text":"SWENSONS, AHH. What else is there to say?

If you're a northeast Ohioan, you already know. If you're not, you need to be simply just for this reason. 
These burgers don't look like much, but I can assure you, they are everything. Their special sauce, their secret ingredients, their brown sugar, everything is right about these burgers. The Galley Boy is their signature, it's a big burger, with just about everything you need on a burger. Then buns are toasted, which make them look not-all-that-special to be honest, but that's the only way they do their buns, toasted. It's all about their hamburger patties and how they make/cook them. Their special ingredients in the burger itself-is what makes Swensons special. Not to mention their fries, all of their fried sides for that matter, are awesome because they're, well, fried. Fried zucchini bites are my favorite.
You must take a milkshake to-go on your way out. They have so many flavor options, it's stupid. But you will find something that you will LOVE, I promise you. They change their flavor options up so much honestly, I think seasonally. There's no way to not love their milkshakes too. It's a great Saturday afternoon, stop after shopping and grab something to eat, kind-of-place, (also great hangover food).

It's a MUST-TRY in the northeast Ohio area for sure. If you find yourself going through Cleveland or Akron/Canton area, you must give it a go-just to say you did."}
{"text":"Yas! Give me all of the Swensons!!

I'm so excited I don't have to drive far for my favorite snacks! 

Took the dogs with us tonight and ate some very tasty treats! The staff was on point and very friendly. The food was fantastic. The milk shakes were even better!

Literally, we didn't wait at all and our food was hot and delicious. Can't wait to come again."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious!  My favorite is their hamburger, it taste better than a lot of sit down fancy restaurants burgers.  The service here is also why I keep going back.  You never have to wait and they are fast!  The prices here are also very cheap.  I prefer Swenson's over Sky-way any day!"}
{"text":"Love the burgers, shakes and unbeatable prices. The staff really hussles but somehow at both visits our wait time has seemed a bit long! Overall a great place."}
{"text":"The Galley Boy is the best burger anywhere! A must have every time by one of their locations. Great food, great service and a still very reasonable price. Get some onion rings on the side and wash it down with a milkshake and you couldn't be better."}
{"text":"Took me a while but I love that dally boy burger and it's so cheap!!! U raw swensons keep it up"}
{"text":"This is an Akron area staple. My wife grew up with Swensons and she was super excited that there is one nearby now. The galley boy is indeed a fantastic cheese burger. The service is great as well. The car hops are always sprinting around to get to everyone as quickly as possible. This a great addition to the area."}
{"text":"I love the galley boy with the green olive on a toothpick stuck in the wrapper. Nice touch. I also love their fried mushrooms. Those are my go to items. It's a great place to go if you want to be lazy and stay in your car. Great friendly service. Sonic has nothing on this drive-in."}
{"text":"You don't go to Swensons because you want a healthy snack. You go to Swensons because it's about ten thousand times better than any other conventional fast food places around. Perhaps it will take a few minutes longer to get your meal, but it's worth it. The Galley Boy burger might be one of the best tasting burgers I have ever had in my entire life. Try it once, and you WILL be drawn back for more."}
{"text":"Drive in. Lights on for service. Service to your car window, eat in car. Burgers are different than your typical grease fired burgers. I believe  they are steam grilled with onion water - not sure exactly, but they are good! They are thin patties, so get at least a double, and maybe a triple. The onion rings are a must. Order them in Swenson's lingo (Onion rings, well-done, broken) = crunchy, golden brown, onion ring bites! Inexpensive. Busy in summer months, but they do have a big lot and can handle many customers at once."}
{"text":"The food truck has come too my job before but this was my first drive in visit. What a great experience!! The car hops were quick friendly and the food was quick accurate and wonderful!! I'll be back !!!"}
{"text":"We've been pleased each time we've stopped for carryout. We've learned not to order too many sides because the burgers are quite filling."}
{"text":"At first I was skeptical about the galley boy burger, because I was told that the sauce in it was kind of sweet, and I don't like sweet taste in a burger. However, even after the first bite, I was amazed. One of the best burger I've ever tried. Also, if you go there, remember to try the onion rings. It's the BEST onion rings ever.
After trying the galley boy for a few times, I decided to try the cheeseburger. I am not a big fan of the cheeseburger but if it's your first time there, make yourself a favor and go with the galley boy and onion rings. You can thank me later :)"}
{"text":"Don't get up...

The burgers are flat iron grilled on a grill that is obviously well seasoned!  Any burger is fantastic and doubles as a more than adequate hangover cure.  The service is Ricky-Bobby fast and courteous almost to the point of annoying, but not quite.  What else can I say that probably already hasn't been said.  You owe yourself a burger from Swensons.  Do it now!"}
{"text":"This place was so-so. The double cheeseburger I got was pretty bland tasting and overpriced. I found myself regretting not pulling into the nearby Burger King instead and getting a bigger better tasting burger for a few dollars less. Very friendly service despite it being very slow even for a not so busy day. You can get better food for your money in this area. If you are really in the mood for the best chesseburger for the money drive over to Yours Truely or Red Robin in the neighboring Independence area 6 minutes away. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Galley boy was good the sauce was barbecue and some kind of mayo. The pumpkin shake was the best which held a perfect pumpkin flavor!"}
{"text":"Galley Boy.

The most disgusting sounding burger on the face of the Earth... isn't disugsting at all.  It is pure awesome wrapped up in wax paper.

How could two burger patties that have brown sugar in them, slathered in velveeta, barbecue sauce, and tartar sauce, taste good?  I don't know.  But, I know that it does.

I recommend washing down your Galley Boy with a bologna sandwich.  Fried onions on the sandwich don't hurt.

And a peanut butter hot fudge milkshake for dessert and the drive home.  Oh God.

We are talking about a place that specializes in soft hot drive-in comfort food.  No artisanal bread, no thick angus beef patties, just great diner food cooked on a flat top or in a deep fryer, served fast.  Lightning fast.  Other reviewers don't exaggerate... the servers SPRINT to and from your car.

I don't get to Swenson's nearly often enough, and my waistline thanks me."}
{"text":"Such a fun place to go.  Service is always great and the food is always very tasty.  The obvious choice here is the Galley Boy, but the other sandwiches are very good also.  Highly recommend their fries and chocolate shake.  My son also loves their fish sandwich."}
{"text":"Great burgers, fries and onion rings. With the holiday season they are busier than normal but they were still very fast and efficient. The food was fresh and delicious. If you looking for burgers this is the place to go. We had shakes as well. The workers are pretty dedicated as they run back and forth taking your order and bringing your food. 

Try the jalape√±o poppers and they also have wonderful salads."}
{"text":"I had sooo much fun here I thought I might die but still alive and writing this review, swensens is a place of joy so don't go if you don't love joy but do go if you are sad and want to experience joy or if you are already joyful and want to take it to the next level, they literally run to your car, I recommend everything, think this is my longest review yet, peace and blessings to all"}
{"text":"Service is always top notch and the food is without question awesome!  This is the one place I craved the most after moving away from the Akron area for 13 years. It was always my first stop from the airport. I get a double cheeseburger with everything (mustard,pickle and onion) and ketchup, an order of fries and a large pepsi, that comes with their famous crushed ice.
The galley boys are great but sometimes a little to sweet and tangy for me.
This is the meal I would want, if I could only have one more meal in my life. Thats how much I like it."}
{"text":"Nobody could honestly rate this super fast, made to order, drive-in burger joint as 5stars, BUT this is as good as you can get for this type of food, and a must selection for any parent with small children.  It's great fun to eat in your car, watch the young waiters rush back and forth and put your lights on when you are ready to leave."}
{"text":"Fun old fashioned atmosphere, good food.  Loved the onion rings and burgers.  Great friendly service. Try for a quick fast food meal without the drive thru."}
{"text":"There's a burger phenomenon going on right now. Celebrity chefs are in a tizzy to create gourmet meat on bun concoctions with toppings previously unheard of on a burger. Chains making these ground chuck patty cakes have infiltrated all ends of our suburbs. And they're acting like they reinvented an American classic. But sometimes, it's the original that does it the best. Sometimes change isn't necessary. 

It's this reason why Swensons remains as other burger joints come and go depending on the trend. Swensons however has been doing it the same for 75+ years. They have a formula. And it's successful. No one, not even an Iron Chef can compete. Thin semi-sweet (brown sugar?) patties held together with melty cheese and steamed buns. Sounds simple, but I've yet to find a burger that competes in flavor. There's is simply the best around. 

A typical trip involves their signature burger, The Galley Boy, an order of Potato Teezers (breaded and fried potato, cheese, jalape√±o) w/ a side of ranch and a 16oz California (grape drink over crushed ice). If I ever found myself on death row, this would be on my short list of last meals."}
{"text":"Great burgers for a great price, came from out of town and love it.  Milkshakes are bomb, the fries are perfect. The potato teezers are scrumptious."}
{"text":"Best drive in food in the area, great burgers, great shakes, and great sides and shakes"}
{"text":"I love Swenson's. Their burgers and milk shakes are the best in town. I usually visit Swenson's in the summer but I had a taste for a galley boy. This burger like the other I had in the past was super tasty. If you haven't checked out Swenson's you're missing out!!! The service is always great and the food is always super tasty."}
{"text":"For the love of God, don't order the scissors.

I had to try this place after the rave reviews it received from, well everyone.  I have to say I was not disappointed. 

Every state has a chain burger joint it claims is the best.  While Swensons isn't my all time fav, it certainly is quality

My first visit I had the galley boy, all the way.  To give you an idea, it's like a chili dog had an affair with a cheese burger and you get to eat their offspring.  Maybe I'm crazy talking about eating burger babies, but man it was delicious.  It gets the unique flavor from a BBQ like sauce they generously apply. Couple that with made to order fries and onion rings, son you have yourself one tasty triple bypass.  

You will find yourself thinking about Swensons hours after eating.  It may be the acid reflux, it may be BBQ hamburdog onion burps.  

In either case... BAM, you've been Swensoned!"}
{"text":"We swing by Swensons whenever we deserve a treat (read: delicious quick burger, amazing fried mushrooms, and onion rings. and maybe a specialty shake)"}
{"text":"Amazing. Amazing. Chocolate peanut butter milkshakes are delicious. Burgers are top notch. Best restaurant for a quick bite and nostalgia if you're good letting your waste line suffer for the day. And the service is great.. Kids run so fast and always get the orders perfect. Love! Bring all my out of town guests here."}
{"text":"Fries are very good, last time got the galley boy was real good as well.  Have issues with people flashing lights of cars, and teens running around in a dark parking lot to serve them.  Not safe at all with the bumper blocks and miserable to see when its raining or snowing outside.  This is not for us, gave it a couple of shots and each time not a great experience as far as the running around of server, maybe in Florida or Cali but Really wish they would re-tool this place and make it a great drive thru, would probably triple their business.  The food is pretty good they even have delicious split fried hot dogs, just hate to see the servers running around to cars with trays in the elements, the whole nostalgia thing needs to go."}
{"text":"Like many of the other reviews the Galley Boy is one of the best burgers ever.  I consider my brother to be very knowledgeable about burgers.  The Galley Boy holds top rank in his book.  The Salad Boy is the vegetarian equivalent.  It ranks high in my family since we have 3 vegetarians.

I follow my Galley Boy up with onion rings which are good along with a California(purple pop and sprite).  It's definitely work the trip!"}
{"text":"Swensons is totally different than any other chain out there. I like the idea of having your car getting you service with your lights, which I was confused at first on what to do. and shouts to the workers that have to be out there in all types of weather because it was raining so hard when I went, and the service was still amazing. The burger was very good and greasy to my liking. Def want to go back and try many other things."}
{"text":"WOOT WOOT THERE'S A SWENSONS IN THE BURBS! GALLEY BOYS FOR EVERYONE!

If you've never been to Swensons, you owe it to yourself to try it at least once. Swensons is an Ohio institution that has been around since the 1930's. They run and deliver food to your car (lights on for service) and revive the culture of old-fashioned burgers. Try a Galley Boy, which is the double cheeseburger with special sauces and magic. I swear, a Galley Boy cures everything from hunger to hangovers. Once you have one, you'll remember and love it. Aside from the burgers, they also have lighter fare like salads and healthy-ish things (LOL, never seen everyone order them ever, YOLO, but I appreciate the effort), and awesome sides like potato teezers. You can't go wrong with anything from the menu.

Just be forewarned: This location is a madhouse. Service was noticeably slower than the lightning fast kind you'll be used to at other locations. If it's your first time, be patient and kind to the kids who are working here. This location is about 2-months old they likely still have some kinks to work out! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"GIVE ME ALL THE SWENSONS.

With me, at this point, a review of Swensons probably isn't that shocking anymore. I love a good Swensons. If there's one nearby, i'm almost sure to take my out-of-town visitor for a burger.

As i've said before, these high school kids are doing THE LORD'S WORK. You pull into a spot, turn on your lights, and these kids literally run to your car. They take your order in 10 seconds and serve you even faster. You can't go wrong with a galley boy (their signature burger with special sauces) and a California drink (a mix of soda and grape). You can get your food to-go or eat in your car with a tray attached to your window.

Swenson's is an inexpensive hometown favorite that you must try at once, especially with the family. There's a reason Lebron loves the Akron Swensons so much... its the legit old-school burger and shake joint with a ooey, gooey amazing menu. Best of all, show up in your sweatpants. No one will judge you. Pretty sure these employees have seen it all!"}
{"text":"I am not ashamed that I love Swenson's. If you don't love it...I have serious questions about our friendship. 

No photos for this review, since everyone in my car were a bunch of animals and I couldn't get any pics. Swenson's is a no-brainer five stars for burgers and greasy goodness.  I mean, there is a reason Lebron James brought Amy Schumer to their Akron location. When you're in Stow, you pull up to this old-school drive-in and put on your lights. These crazy hardworking highschool guys will run to your car in .5 seconds to take your order. Once its placed, it comes out fairly quickly. The guys will hook the tray to the exterior of your car window. Just be careful about toying with your lights. My Mom and I always feel ridiculous when we take our Dads car, forget which buttons control the lights, then awkwardly apologize to the kids when they run to our car (lights indicate that you need something). Sorry Swensons, I heart you.

Pro tip: get the Galley Boy burger. Every time. Swenson's special sauce is an A+. Paired with their California drink, you're going to love your life. Whether you're hungover, or just craving a good burger, there's no judgement here. There's a good chance 50% of the patrons are in one of those same boats as you."}
{"text":"So it's my first time visiting this place. Noticed others turn their lights on and those young workers FLY to your car for service! Super pleasant workers, eating in the car brings back memories, and wait for .......... amazing burgers!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Swensons is good. But not if you are counting calories. I always get a Shake too. 
One other idea. I just stay there in my car and eat. This way if I haven't made a complete pig of myself, I can do another GO-ROUND.

{"text":"This place is awesome.  I'm here in Akron on a business trip from California.  Comparisons between Swensons and In N' Out really aren't fair, as the food is very different and therefore not really comparable.

I went for a galley boy burger, potato puffs (tater tots), and a seasonal special pumpkin shake.  The burger was 2 patties, cheese, and \"special sauce\" that tasted like a sweeter, milder version of barbeque sauce with sweet relish mixed in.  The burger had a unique taste that I can't really compare to any other burger that I've had, but it was certainly tasty.  The tater tots were just standard tots, which is a good thing.  The shake was very thick and had a great pumpkin pie flavor.  I am going to be here in Akron for another week and will definitely try to go to Swensons at least one more time.

For Swensons rookies, here's the procedure.   Pull up into any available building-adjacent parking spot, and turn your headlights on.  This lets the carhops know that you are awaiting service.  When one of them comes to your window, ask for a menu, then turn your lights off.  When you've made your selections, turn your lights back on and they'll come right back to take your order.  You can choose to eat your food there (but you have to eat in your car) or take it to go.  I assume that if you eat it there, they give you a tray or something.  I took mine to go.  I would estimate that the food took about 5 minutes to come out, and it was served in wax paper bags.

Overall, I have nothing to complain about whatsoever.  The food was great, the car-side service was great, and the price was great.  In California everything costs more, but I paid $7.70 for a burger, tots, and a shake, and that's just stupid cheap."}
{"text":"Look, I'm gonna say it: I don't love Swenson's as much as a native Northeast Ohioan is probably supposed to. I have great memories of going to it as a kid with my dad - hot dog & a hot fudge sundae, every Wednesday after dances classes - & I definitely love the experience & nostalgia of grabbing a meal here every once in awhile. But the food? Doesn't bowl me over.

I didn't eat my first hamburger until I was 26, just because I always thought they were going to be gross (did I just blow my reviewing credibility?), so when I finally decided it was time, I knew my first had to come from Swenson's. It was the right choice for a cheeseburger newbie because the meat is so sweet & pounded thin - definitely an uncommon burger taste. That first time, I liked it but didn't LOVE it, & now that I'm a cheeseburger regular, it turns out that I still feel the same. Something about Swenson's burgers just doesn't wow me like they do everyone else.

I love the potato teezers, & I'm a big fan of their malts, but if I want a good burger, I'm headed to BurgerFi in the Falls. Sorry, Swenson's. Can I keep my Akronite card after writing this review?"}
{"text":"I like their service it's fast it's quick burgers or a little above your average fast food but overall a good experience keep it up boys"}
{"text":"The food here is greasy, greasy, greasy. If you're in the mood for that, you are in the right place. My friend got their famous burger and absolutely loved it. I got a chicken sandwich and it was fine. The fried mushrooms were very greasy and not particularly tasty although they were also fine."}
{"text":"At the risk of making a lot of long time followers of this place mad at me - I am going to just say I don't get it.  The burger is kinda what I would expect at a bad fast food chain, it's some gray mystery meat with some BBQ sauce weirdness on it.  The chocolate shake has nothing resembling real chocolate in it, the strawberry shake is a bright pink color that does not resemble anything found in nature.

The onion rings were good.  I have determined that it is not good enough to risk running over someone in their parking lot.  I understand the nostalgia, but that's why there are photographs and memories."}
{"text":"The best of the best! Burgers & Veggie burgers. I looooooooove this place and am so lucky I live so close to one!"}
{"text":"Do you like In 'N Out? Do you like Shake Shack? Then you will LOVE Swensons!

Again. This chain needs to take over the world.  Better than In 'n Out (king of the west coast) and better than Shake Shack (king of the east coast).  Swenson's should spread its love to both coasts.  They are missing out.

Galley boy + potato teezers + milkshake"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite to go on the go place. The workers are usually very friendly. Even if the place is packed it's definitely worth the wait and the workers always try to get to you fast. A very affordable place to go. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I found myself in Akron the other day, and of course, every time I visit a new city, I do a quick yelp search for restaurants.  So I search for Akron.  Restaurants.  Highest Rated.  #1... Swensons Drive In?  What?  A burger place?  I'll pass.  #2.  Some Mexican place.  #3.  Swensons Drive In.  Eh?

I'd have to say, my fellow yelpers are correct about this place.  You park your car and turn on your lights, and the servers run over and take your order.  I had the Galley Boy with onions, the fried mushrooms, and the Florida (orange juice and ginger ale).  Came out to 6 bucks.  Tasted fantastic.  It's all in the sauce.  I've been to Five Guys and B-Spot.  This blows them both out of the water.  

Oh, and this doesn't mean anything to me, but my girlfriend, a SoCal native, told me that it tasted like In-N-Out Burger.  I think that's good?

So If you're ever in the area, check it out.  It's worth the trip."}
{"text":"This Akron icon did not disappoint.  You pull up and someone is there even before you put in in park.  You order and go or order and eat, all in the parking lot.  Headlights on - gets you a server.   Fast.  These kids sprint to your car.   I accidentally turned my lights on a couple of times and whoosh, some kid is racing out to the car.  Food comes out on tray that clips to the inside of the door..

So this place is famous for the Galley Boy burger - they claim it to be America's best cheeseburger.  Had to try it.  It's two patties, yellow cheese, and two kinds of sauce.  A BBQ sauce is on the bottom and a mayonnaisey-sweet pickle relish sauce is on the top. It's all placed on fresh toasted brioche bun.  This burger is all about the sauce.  There's sauce oozing into and out of every nook and cranny of this thing.  I'm like, \"where's the beef?\"  That being said, it is a tasty mess.  For about $3, there's money left in my wallet for a Lipitor.  Is it America's best?  No.  Worth trying?  You bet.

This place has some other old-school stuff too ... Fried bologna sandwich!  I thought people only made that at home.  Shakes, malts - 18 flavors!  Phosphates - sound bad for you but actually it's just old tyme word for soda.

We need more places like this - quirky and full of local flavor!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Love Swensons! Great burgers soups and sides! Very unique drive in. 18 milkshake flavors!  Galley Boy is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Swensons is a CLASSIC and a family favorite. Whenever I am in town I have to stop and get a burger!"}
{"text":"The burgers are to die for! I've been here many times and never had a bad experience. Definitely try the galley boy."}
{"text":"Food most of the time is top notch when they get your order right don't bother calling in because they always tell you eight minutes I just left there for a total of 45 minute turnaround when I called it in and sat there for almost 25 minutes what a joke service horrible"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried their Ribeye Sandwich, you HAVE to.  We already know they have awesome burgers.  I really can't think of anything I've had there that wasn't AWESOME!  Oh, and don't get me started on the milkshakes..."}
{"text":"Swensons provides the supreme serotonin-releasing gustatory pleasure of monging upon a greasy burger and sending a milkshake down the hatch after it with ease--the fact that they run to your car window like fit, sporty maniacs as they do it feels like a perverse reward. An Akron area staple since what would seem to be the beginning of recorded time, the big S has garnered enough accolades to make Dave Thomas blush. It has, and continues to, battle royale Sky Way: rubber city's other drive-in juggernaut, but distinguishes itself with singularly delectable burgers (rumor has it they pump the suckers full of brown sugar), shakes, phosphates, and onion rings. Though Sky Way has its sweet grape Californian sodas, Swensons seems somehow more brazenly American--the quintessential red, white, and blue drive-in. It's difficult to explain until you try it. Oh, and, yes, the homemade veggie burgers (gender coded: \"salad boys\") are rad as well, but anyone other than lap-spill fetishists would do well to ask for easy on the sauce(s). As a final thought, to ensure the dining room is clean: sweep your floor mats and empty your center console before you get there!"}
{"text":"My brother-in-law lives in Stow, OH and this place is now the one thing I look forward to.  We were hungry late one night and started driving around for a place to eat and this place was crowded with cars.  Just park your car and leave your headlights on for service and a waiter will literally run to your window to take your order.  Cheap eats, fast service, and a unique experience.  What more could you ask for?

(Oh yeah and about the food... we had cheeseburgers, which were on toasted buns... fresh cut fries... a vanilla-pepsi float... and a root-beer float.  Excellent fast food.)"}
{"text":"Okay, I think I've found what sets Akron, or for that matter, Ohio apart from other towns is the fast food.  They have a lot of it here...saw Steak n Shake..first one ever outside of Texas.  But Swensons...est. 1934...in Akron(Their history on their website is the absolute worst I've ever seen.  They just assume everyone knows where Hawkins Ave. is(It's in Akron)). Swensons is sworn by every Akronite I've met.  I tried Skyway...and was truly impressed, and with Swensons...just as impressed.  I had a feast I tell ya....especially after a strenuous spin class at Southside Gym.  I had the highly recommended Galley Boy, Onion Rings, and Cheese Puffs(aka. tater tots).  The onion rings are what Burger Kings wishes...consistently crispy and full of edible onion...not that cheap onion where you bite into it, and it slides out of the ring shaped fried crust.  Possibly the best onion rings I've ever had.  Tater tots...just like Sonics...so whatever.  The burger...is one hell of a unique burger.  It's a double cheese burger, and the sauce is a cross of barbque, relished, tangy ketchup sauce.  Very little ketchup but that's what really sets this Akron institution apart.  Quite an extensive milk shake menu too.  If you're in Akron, you definitely need to stop by.  Smokes the white castle cheeseburgers I had yesterday by a million miles!"}
{"text":"Yes! Swenson's has branched outside of Akron into Cleveland. If you have never been to a Swenson's you definitely have to try them out. This is not a traditional sit-down place. Everything is done from the car. The process of ordering may seem unusual if you have never been here before. When you have decided what you want from the menu, turn the headlights on and one of the runners will come take your order and they will literally run to your car.

Our food was hot and fresh when it arrived at our car. The burgers at Swenson's have a certain taste that is different from your typical burger and I mean that in a good way. The galley boy is a double patty cheeseburger with sauces. When you try one you will be hooked. The onion rings were perfect. The hot dogs with coney sauce are the best. Just get extra napkins if you plan on eating it in the car.

The menu is extensive. You know this place is special when they offer a fried bologna sandwich. I definitely give Swenson's a high recommend."}
{"text":"This is what the Akron area is known for! I was happy with my order of potato teasers and a cheeseburger but I honestly might prefer to go to Five Guys. I mean, it's cheaper and I get more food there... this place is definitely more creative though. Ohhh and I ordered a Mint Whip. Never have had something quite like that before. Frothy and carbonated... dare I say milky? It wasn't a milkshake but it wasn't a pop. Definitely worth ordering again. 

As always the service was good. Don't forget: lights on for service!!!!"}
{"text":"Devoted Swensons fan here!  This is the best fast food takeout burger ever!  And don't forget the shakes when you go....GO NOW!!!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to have a Swenson's so close to my house because I have heard so many good things. I went to get a milkshake with hot fudge and caramel and it came out 2 minutes later which is why I gave it 2 stars because of good service. However, the milkshake I was so excited for was very room temperature and almost warm which was disgusting. I do not recommend warm milkshakes, it tasted like warm, thick, chocolate milk which is not appetizing. I am very disappointed and confused on to how a food place can make this happen and serve it. Couldn't even drink any of it, had to throw it out."}
{"text":"used to have to drive to Akron or Kent to satisfy our Swenson's indulgence so it was like a dream come true when this one opened a mere 2 blocks from our house .. their cheeseburgers .. onion rings .. puffs .. and specialty drinks never disappoint .. wish they would have a smoking section in the lot .. it totally sucks when you have the windows down on a nice day to enjoy a meal & someone pulls up next to you puffing smoke so close to you that you cannot enjoy your food w/out putting the window up"}
{"text":"This place truly rocks my socks!!  Their food is always fresh and made to order.  Their Galley Boy is so flipping good and juicy that it feels like a Sun eating it!  This is your typical drive in restaurant.  Basically you drive in, park, and they run up to your car quickly.  I swear this job will make anyone lose weight or stay fit.

These people have the best service.  When they see your headlights on they rush to your vehicle to make sure you're being accommodated.  Their fries don't look homemade but they are thick cut which is definitely delicious.  Their onion rings are fairly big as well and seems like it is more batter than onion ring.  The potato teezers are so delicious and each order comes with 5 of them so sharing is caring or get another order.  But after eating the burger, I truly get full which makes it hard to eat the sides.  Some people can do it but it was definitely hard for me but the burger as a leftover is still just as good when you first got it.

Love their food!! Highly recommend their burgers to anyone!"}
{"text":"First time here was such a fun experience! If only I knew to read the yelp reviews BEFORE placing my order and I would have known to get these potato puffs instead of fries. Oh well, next time! 

Vegetarians can get the salad boy. Vegans, ask for no butter on the buns, no cheese and no special sauces (our server couldn't tell us what was in the sauces)"}
{"text":"Warning!  Habit forming!  Get the galley boy and a Xango for dessert!"}
{"text":"Swensons is an awesome local burger chain! The galley boy, potato teasers and a coney style grilled cheese are a few of the menu items that really stand out. I would definitely recommend this burger over any of your big chain burger joints. Give it a try sometime!"}
{"text":"We ordered the galley boy,  fried mushrooms, fried zucchini, peanut butter milkshake,  butterscotch milkshake and 1/2lb cheese burger...it all was amazing! And our waiter was great, his button said trainee but he was already a pro! We had fast friendly and knowledgeable service. We absolutely will be returning."}
{"text":"I used to love stopping at Swensons, theirs apps, burgers, and shakes are great! Service in the past was great however I will not be coming back after our last experience.  My husband stopped to pick up 2 malts.  He waited more than 40 minutes for them. Waiters were no help at expediting getting them to our car and were rude."}
{"text":"The servers LITERALLY run to greet you. They're always incredibly polite (think Chick-Fil-A: my pleasure to serve you style). They're fast here, but don't come expecting drive thru speeds; there's a difference . Their burgers are world famous for a reason- I personally make the hour drive to get my fix. They have great side selections such as your typical french fries, onion rings, etc. I highly recommend the zucchini which is my persnal favorite. If shakes are your thing, they have a long list of flavors and endless combinations."}
{"text":"One of my go-to fast food neighborhood places.  Old school drive in atmosphere, great burgers.  Tasty fish and shrimp baskets, chicken fingers.   Good fries.   Fun, energetic staff.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Galley Burger (a must try!), Fries, Grilled Cheese, Egg Salad Sandwich & Sloppy Joes are just a few of the most awesome things on the menu!  Their Crinkle Pickles are so good!  The Xango for dessert is so good!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure Mr S climbed Olympus and snagged Zeus's Burger because these Burgers are other worldly good. I could eat 10. 

Then he kept the classic kitchen to car service supply line. The way the workers sprint car to car splitting tips and working hard is as good as an Olympic event. I can't help but tip big when I see this. 

Get a galley boy... get a shake... shoot get the whole dang menu because in Mr S I trust."}
{"text":"Swenson's is a local Northeast Ohio treasure! We typically make the trek to the Kent or North Akron location (even during the snowy wintertime). The new University Heights location is in John Carroll University''s neck of the woods. It is nestled in a parking lot shared with Jack's Deli. This sometimes causes parking issues when trying to back into a spot, however don't hesitate to do a few loops.

My favourite form of entertainment is when new customers get out of their cars and try to go inside. Please note: you park, turn on your lights, and a car hop sprints at 100-miles-per hour to your car to take your order. YOU EAT INSIDE YOUR CAR...DRESS ACCORDINGLY. On the menu, there is something for everyone! Fried Bologna to Galley Boys!

I like their Sloppy Joe. It is a recipe crafted in 1934. I like to think it was made by Grandmother Swenson. It is served on a hamburger bun. The sauce is sweet and tangy at the same time. I also got the potato teasers on this trip. They are crispy tater tots crafted with cheese and jalape√±o inside. Ask for ranch dressing as a dipper. 

Save room for their fresh milkshakes too! My favorite is Key Lime! On this trip, I ordered Lemon. It was a subtle lemon flavor. Not overpowering at all."}
{"text":"Yummy yum yums.    Great food, amazing customer service.     Really loved this place when i was driving through Seven Hills."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes yes yes. You pull in, and a younger adult comes running out to your car immediately to take your order, and shortly after waddles back out with your food. Delicious food without ever leaving your car, on top of extremely low prices? Can't beat it. Try the Galley Boy, a milkshake, and cheddar potato fritters (something alone those line) - you won't regret it."}
{"text":"if you're in the area you gotta stop here. places like this don't exist nowadays and the food is way better than that garbage they serve at sonic."}
{"text":"Let me just say, obsessed! Best place for food after drinking, but also delicious at any time that you feel the need for a cheap burger! I always get the exact same thing and when you talk about consistency, they have it. I get a basic cheeseburger, tator tots, and a ginger ale. For my boyfriend and I, with tip, it's ten bucks. You can't beat that, and the food is super tasty and satisfying without making you feel terrible about yourself afterwards. 
I've heard some of the others things on the menu are also tasty and I'm sure they are, however I get the same thing each time bc it's sure to hit the spot. 
They can sometimes take a little longer than you'd like for fast food, but that's bc they are always busy and I'm okay with that knowing the outcome! 
If you've not tried Swensons, stop eating the fast food you eat currently and check them out!"}
{"text":"Swensons serves the most delicious burger on the planet. No am not exaggerating, they are hands down my favorite burger. If I moved out of state, I would have to come back just to get Swensons.

They actually have quite an extensive menu, although mostly known for their burgers and shakes, and everything on the menu is tasty.

Some of the best:

Double cheeseburgers- the meat is delicious, the choose is always melty and gooey, and the bun is sweet and tasty and flaky!

Potato Teazers- jalape√±o and cheese filled and deep fried. Best dipped in their ranch.

Potato puffs- deep fried tator tots. 

Fried mushrooms- not too big, not super runny or watery, fried golden brown, and again would reconvened ranch.

Fried zucchini sticks- need a little salt, but they are tasty. 

Milkshakes- any flavor, although my personal favorite is the mint milkshake. It blows shamrock shakes out of the water. Not even in the same league.

The California or the Florida drinks- you have to try them to understand. Fruity and outstanding.

The service at Swensons is fast and great. They run to your car. Overall 5 stars without question."}
{"text":"Burgers are good-most of the flavor is in the buns. Fries are piping hot and I appreciate that the salt is served on the side rather than on fries.
The 1/2 lemonade/iced tea is refreshing but I think I like the plain lemonade the best.  Service very efficient. My only suggestion is that the print on the signage could be larger  for those of us who are not 20/20."}
{"text":"King James knows what's up. Swensons is an Akron-area institution. There are several locations on the south-ish side of Cleveland and in and around A-K Rowdy. From Lakewood, it's a far drive for us so we only get to have the treat when we're en route to or from points south. Worth it. 

Service is always friendly and efficient. Eat in your car with a clip on tray for your window. Kids running their asses off to take your order and get your food out quick. I've only ever tried the burgers, shakes and fried mushrooms. All are very good drive-in quality stuff. I know the Galley Boy is kind of the signature here, but for me, whatever special sauce they put on it is a little too sweet. I like to keep it simple: a cheeseburger 'with everything' which at Swenson's means onion, pickles, and mustard. SO GOOD.

The buns are toasted which gives a nice texture addition to the thin, tasty burgers. Bonus points that the onions are sliced, not chopped. I just don't get chopped onions on a burger; they all fall out all over the place.

Anyhow, Swenson's is definitely worth a stop. With several locations and now a food truck, there's probably one not far from you."}
{"text":"This is the only place I will cheat on my diet for. A co-worker had said I needed to come here and finally decided to give it go!

OMFG! I'm a fat girl, but never a fat girl who would eat cheese off of paper. However, this place made me do it! I admit it freely! It's delicious.

When my friends and family come in from out of state this is the first place we hit before we go anywhere. You park and turn on your head lights and young people come running. Its even better when they carry food! 

Its perfect with the kids too! You plug your phone into the charger put on some netflix and enjoy your food in quite with such a pretty view of the sky. Never had a problem with any of the employees or the food. 

The only real complaint I can think of is there is 1 bathroom and its not very well vented so bring a clothes pin or some spray!"}
{"text":"I think I'm a fan, having just moved here from Seattle this is definitely my go to place for burgers. Good food, great service and I do enjoy the old school feel. The burger's way better than in n out, fries tho is meh. Thumbs up from moi."}
{"text":"Just to give you an idea of how good the Galley Boy is...I have literally finished running 5 miles and gotten straight into my car to head to Swenson's for one of these burgers.  You will hardly EVER wait for service by one of the speedy waiters (they stampede to your car as soon as they see you coming into the lot), and if you do it's only because they are slammed...but it's totally worth the wait, I promise."}
{"text":"Being an Akron Zip, Swensons is pretty much in my blood. Park near or far and watch them haul a$$ to your car! They'll hand you a huge menu but here's what you need to know: The Galley Boy burger will
Change your life, the sauces on it set it apart from the rest. Also, try the potato teasers they are like the beautiful big sister to French fries or jalape√±o poppers. Eat in your car and turn back on your lights and the workers will run back out and grab your trash. You might want to go home immediately after because I always fall asleep within 15 minutes of devouring my galley boy."}
{"text":"Swenson's,
My rose in a world of pachysandra.
The virgin in line at the abortion clinic.
The sweetest brown sugared meat ever to slide between two buttered buns,
You are my calling.

Swenson's,
How is your cheese so melty?
Your shakes so thick,
Your rings so crisp,
And your teezers but a suckle of heaven's starch.

Swenson's,
Your servers so bronzed and handsome,
Inexplicably eager to serve me,
Not that I'm complaining.
Hot damn, you complete me.

Swenson's,
You've been so good to me.
Never chained out of Northeast Ohio,
Never selling out,
Like a good punk band, but fatty and delicious.

Swenson's,
Born and raised in your tradition,
I am your Galley Boy.

Swenson's,
I'm holding out for you.
You've got my first name and phone number.

{"text":"Based on the reviews, I had high expectations for this place. After visiting twice, I have concluded that it is very overrated.

I first tried the \"Galley Boy,\" and found that all I could taste was the barbecue sauce, which didn't have a pleasant flavor. The french fries were a good texture but way under-salted (and I prefer my food to be lightly salted so there must have been like no salt). The onion rings and milkshakes seemed good, although how do you mess up a milkshake? My son had the chicken strips and they seemed decent. I was impressed with how hot everything was and how it didn't seem greasy.

On my second visit, I ordered the double cheeseburger so I could find out how the burgers really taste. The burger was just totally bland. The meat has no flavor. The fries were again under-salted.

It's cheap and the service is pretty good, but the food is too bland. I can only attribute the high rating to the limited options for burgers in the area or nostalgia from the locals."}
{"text":"Not a lot to think here - local fast food, with friendly service and tasty burgers. Can't go wrong.

Is this the best burger in town? Probably not. Is it good and with crazy good prices, yes. Don't overthink, stop at Swensons and enjoy a burger, fries and a shake and have a great day."}
{"text":"The Galley Boy is all you need to know about to understand that Swensons is LEGIT.  But if you need more just pay it a visit and try almost anything on the menu that suits your fare.

My personal favorites on the menu are the Galley Boy, the Jalape√±o Poppers and any one of delicious Milkshakes. 

Generally I like sitting inside a joint, but there's something to the eating in your car part that appeals to me. I can pull up, order some food, eat it and enjoy my own music or an audiobook with minimal interruption. It's almost as if I'm being productive twice over.

Every time I've visited the staff is on point, even when it's raining. They hustle to get your order, bring you food and get you on your way. Just remember to use your headlights to show them you need service.

Ohio is lucky to have this local gem. It's the one treat I look forward to when I hit the Akron area."}
{"text":"Great burgers at good prices with exceptional service. What more can you ask for? A northeast Ohio institution, Swenson's is the epitome of the classic American drive-in. Pull up, turn on your lights and a car hop will run (yes, run!) to your door within seconds. Try the Gallery Boy (with two different special sauces) and zucchini fries. Doesn't get any better!"}
{"text":"Swensons is hands down the best fast food burger I have ever tasted. Anytime I'm in the area I make sure to stop. I would highly recommend It, you don't even have to get out of your car they come right to you."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Food is good, service is fast, and prices are soooo great. This place has the usual drive-in staples... Burgers, French fries, tenders, and lots more. There really is a good selection of food. Overall this place is great and highly recommended. Just pull in, park, and someone will be out to serve you!"}
{"text":"Well this place left a good impression on me. Our friends took us here for dinner while visiting In the area and it was good! We drove right up and they greeted us right away, smiling even though it was snowing and below 20 degrees. 

When it comes to the food, lots of flavor in every bite. We got fries and potatoe teasers. Fries were below average, teasers were amazing! 

The workers were super friendly and seemed to be working hard on a cold day. This place got a four star because they messed up my order. I ordered a double bacon cheeseburger and I got a single patty with no bacon. #Fail. 

Hopefully they get your order right. If you're in the area and in the mood for something similar to Five Guys check them out."}
{"text":"About the hundreds times I've been here, Swenson's has never let me down. I have ordered almost everything on the menu and the burgers are by far my favorite. I definitely agree with Michael Symon that the double decker burger is amazing! Even the veggie sandwich is delicious.

I have never had to wait more than 30 seconds for someone to come up to my car to place an order. They are super quick and very friendly. I really like the drive and dine in the car feel, something different for a change! The prices are extremely reasonable. Oh and the milkshakes are amazing. I think I'm going to head over to Swenson's now!"}
{"text":"It was great the first time I tried it, but the quality decreased upon my next two visits. I order the same burger every time but it somehow always tastes different. Probably won't go back for a while.. still better than any average fast food restaurant"}
{"text":"Usually I dont give five stars. Actually. I dont think Ive ever given a 5 Star review for a restaurant because,usually, something is wrong some where. This place is great. Like \"great\" great lol. Not just casually great. The food wasnt overtly specta2but it was well worth the price. It was very affordable. And the Grape Shake was AMAZING! Also, the staff. The staff was scary nice, and most of all, they ran. They ran, in the rain, to come and take our order and  to bring out the food. They ran in the rain to serve us. Where else have you been with that kind of work ethic or sense of service? They threw our trash away as well and we literally never had to leave the car. Cheers to old school service,done very, very well. Did I mention they're open until 1am? Note to other restaurants,these guys = Checkmate."}
{"text":"It was really good. It felt kinda like stepping into the twilight zone. Excellent service and staff."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite burger places.  It's a must try for anyone and a local favorite for all in the greater Cleveland Akron area.  Try the gallieboy and the potato teasers are always a good choice.  The variety of shakes is also very impressive.  They staff is always friendly even though they are hustling. It's rare to see them not running from a car inside.   Always a great time."}
{"text":"Better than the average fast food burger. I liked the rings, too. Still, not really worth driving out of your way."}
{"text":"Nothing to cray about swanson

What makes here great is they make food when customers order unlike the other fast food and cheap

But you shouldn't expect too much from Swanson they are okay food"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! First let me say hay it's awesome hat they stay open for the winter since most drive ins close. My hubby and I went last week and he ordered the infamous galley boy. I don't even like burgers and thought it was awesome. I got a chili dog, which was good. Then we each got a root beer float, and split fries and onion rings. It was all really good and the servers are awesome - very speedy running around the parking lot."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this \"new\" Swenson's several times. I live nearby and often pass this location. 
So far my experiences have been hit or miss,  but mostly miss. 
I have had my entire order disappear, as in \"we've lost it\". 
I've waited incredibly long times, then received cold and unappetizing food. 
There's been a couple times where it's all come together and been great,  but too few to make it a pattern. 
Still I always tip generously. 
Let me just cut to the chase... 
It's the kitchen staff and whatever poor excuse for management they put in this establishment that are to blame. 
I worked many years in successful & profitable restaurants. I can tell from long, long minutes of observing the function of this restaurant (I always park up front to view the kitchen) exactly what is wrong in one word... COORDINATION! 
That's right,  this place has no effective,  dedicated coordinator. A true expediter ( manager) coordinating the flow of the kitchen. This is why often times we receive cold burgers and hot fried items. 
The one other thing that seems to have infected the kitchen staff is APATHY. They look miserable and disinterested. This translates to poor food quality. I call it hate food. If the person making the food hates their job,  then the quality of the food inevitably suffers. It is then hate food. When the inverse happens,  food quality is high. 
If Swenson's wants to improve and keep it's loyal customers,  it needs to address the kitchen now! 
I'm going to stop visiting this Swenson's for a while, and then see if they've improved after a few months
I'll give an update then. 
I hope they do."}
{"text":"So not sure if I'm lucky or not but this beautiful new building is at the corner of my street. Yes yes yes I have tried it and yes yes it does not do the other Swensons justice. I'm hoping it's just a new thing the kids really try and really run around and it's been nothing but cold here. I do hope they get better the Galley Boy was not very good. The place is always busy and so far so good we only pick up a little trash on a daily basis floating around the street. I do hope they improve the quality of the Galley but I'll give them a few more weeks to test again."}
{"text":"Pretty good, cheap burgers. It's a drive in, where you park and the servers run out to you and bring you your food on a tray (or in a to-go bag) to your car. I really liked the jalape√±o potato popper things. I wish the burgers came with (tomato, lettuce etc) toppings, instead of just basic sauces. Had some zucchini fries which were good, as well as normal fries. Biggest frustration probably is that the little things come with extra charges, like a side of ranch or lettuce on your burger."}
{"text":"Well, I am in Akron as I type this for business. I live a little ways away (45 to 50 mins away). When I travel out of my immediate area I like to dine on places that are unique to that city, and I came across Swensons last night.
I pulled in with my family, and immediately saw that the experience was going to be different when the waiters were booking it from car to car in their uniforms. One of the waiters came up to me and asked me what I was interested in trying (and since I never been here) I asked for a menu. To signal I was ready I was supposed to turn my car in the opposite direction. I was intrigued at this point to the whole being waited on in your car vibe that seems to be a nostalgia of a different time in America. I was amazed that these guys were running so fast in the heat, and was very impressed at their speed to boot. 
Now I ordered the Salad Boy with everything, my fiance' ordered a Cheeseburger with everything, and a couple cheese burgers with everything for my daughters. The drinks were 3 lemonades and a pineapple shake. We got our order in a descent amount of time (not McDonald's fast, but if you want burgers that taste like cardboard then go to McDonald's then). The burgers my fiance and daughters ordered were delicious, and my daughter tore it apart in a hurry. My fiance said that her burger was moist and delicious.....BUT when I bit into my Salad Boy I honestly lit up with amazement at the flavors I experienced on this burger. I can't put my finger on the sauces they use, but I think it could have barbeque and Mayo somewhere in there..... When my fiance tried a bite of mine we were settled that we were going to be getting it again, and we did get it again today; except this time she ordered a Salad Boy as well. We got fries this time, and they were plump and hot off the fryer. 
The only bad experience I had was that I can't eat here regularly, because I live 45 mins away from here. Akron had better be aware of how lucky they are to have this slice of Americana in their back yard."}
{"text":"A retro twist on the burger scene!  Gotta love waiters and waitresses literally running food to your car and hanging it on your window.   No, you do not get out of your car...you just turn on your headlights each time you need a waiter for a menu, to place your order, or to pay.  Swensons reminds me of something from a 1950's movie or the Flintstones cartoon intro.

Anyway, I've eaten here several times and the burgers are just sooo tasty.  I'm totally recommending the half-pound burger!  They have great milk shakes too and their onion rings are the best in town.  Since it's a drive-up and not a drive-thru, expect your order to take more time than a fast food restaurant.  However, the food is made to order so it's fresh and piping hot - just how I like it.

The burgers and rings are the bomb diggity!  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Years ago, I used to be a regular at this place but over the past 2/3 years I've come to the sad realization that getting sick every single time I order a milkshake (and there's are some of the best!) just isn't worht it :(
I have nothing bad to say about this location with the exception of getting food poisoning from their shakes the last 4 times I went. I'm not sure if they changed the recipe or just aren't clean??? But I am super bummed I can't enjoy there peanut butter, coconut, marshmallow, or keylime shakes ever again. But their fries are delicious & always pipping hot- as well as some of the staff, lol. 
And my parents have & still do enjoy there gyros & other selection of sandwiches. So, if you have acid reflux, IBS or a really sensitive stomach I would just avoid their shakes."}
{"text":"I've been going to Swenson's since I've been a little girl, so having one close to home is awesome. There are times that the service is extremely slow but besides that, the food is good. 

More recently, its been a bit dry, but besides that it's good food at a very reasonable price.

Keep doing what you're doing!"}
{"text":"I had a galley boy with some fried mushrooms.   It was good.  The meat was juicy and the mushrooms were nice a crispy.  I then washed it down with a grape soda.  Good stuff."}
{"text":"Best burgers around. Vegetable soup just like grandmas.  Reasonably priced.  Servers are polite."}
{"text":"Service great. Burgers are just ok - maybe we don't clarify our order, but the condiments and extra are never correct. Grilled onions, always raw, most extras orders never make it on the burger.

I think the cheese is nacho cheese or some substitute liquid cheese. Haven't figured it out yet but it's too creamy, unlike slice cheese."}
{"text":"Raised in the Heartland of America, I've had my fair share of excellent and not-so-excellent burgers. Akron is blessed with very good burgers in the hands of Swensons. A step above Sonic with its own charm, I've really come to enjoy my monthly jaunts to Swensons. Their burgers are a bit greasy for my taste, but they are still really juicy and yummy! Not the kind of burgers I regret eating 2 hours later ;). I highly recommend for newcomers to the Akron area!"}
{"text":"You seriously can't go wrong with Swensons.

It's like the In-n-out of CLE. haha. We were in the area and were looking for a quick meal. So....we drove into the drive-in and ordered our food.

Swensons is a drive-in burger location- you park, the waiters (aka high school boys running all over the place) run up to your car, take your order, you leave your lights on, and then they run back out to you with your food on a tray and you eat your food in the car. I really do wish there were more places like it.

Our staples?
Galley boy- there's something in that sauce that makes it ever so good.
Fries- are okay, but just typical
California drink (grape + ginger ale) or Florida (orange + ginger ale). A delicious mix. If I wasn't lactose intolerant, I would probably try their milkshakes- they have quite the extensive menu for them.

Makes for a great great meal- especially when you're craving a good quick burger.

And you know it's good when it's always busy- that's a good sign too."}
{"text":"If you don't typically crave cheeseburgers, you will after eating one from Swenson's. I have no idea what they put in their simple burgers that make them so good. Brown sugar? Paprika? Who knows. What I do know is that Swenson's cheeseburgers are 'the' best cheeseburgers I've ever had. I used to crave going there to get a milkshake and a burger. I am sad that I'll likely never eat one again since I can't see myself going back to Ohio. :-( Anyways, try this fast burger joint if you're in town. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"i know the secret! i know the secret! ready? it's maple syrup, brown sugar, vanilla and raspberry extracts that makes these burgers so DISTINCTIVELY DELICIOUS.  i know this because i met a dude in a bar in brooklyn who used to work there.  and since i'm too far away to enjoy swenson's on a regular basis,  i have been ad hoc-ing in my apartment, without success.  but now i know! and so do you! let's spread swenson's goodness across the globe!"}
{"text":"Omg this was my first time and it was delicious. Especially the milk shake PBMS it was so y that I got another one. The galley boy is different and close slaw was smashing."}
{"text":"If you've never had a Galley Boy.... Omg this is honestly one of the most delicious sammiches ever!!  Guys hustle to the car with the food too. Awesome all around. 

Also crazy milkshakes!!"}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick lunch. The Galley Boy, which is a double cheeseburger with two sauces. An order of fries and a coffee milkshake. The order came out fast and hot. The five star is mostly for the servers who had smiles on their faces, attentive and very very quick. I will be back"}
{"text":"Swenson's has the classic drive-in feel paired with delicious food and employees that run everywhere! The burgers, shakes and potato teezers are amazing. I no longer live in the area, but make it a point to stop at Swenson's every time I am in town and have even considered driving over two hours just to satisfy my Swenson's cravings!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of In-N-Out (west coast food snob )... giving 5 stars to the new Swensons opened in Cleveland ! Keep it up boys! Freshly delicious"}
{"text":"Always quick service with a smile! Can't go wrong at Swensons! Food is delicious. Never had the wrong thing come out. Not your typical fast food."}
{"text":"Swensons is obviously doing things right. The people of Akron have enjoyed this drive in serving burgers, shakes, sides, and classic fountain drinks for over 80 years. The beef with a distinct sweeter flavor is ground daily in their commissary in the Falls. You can have your burger in single, double, triple, quarter pound, or half pound sizes and it will be made to order with the toppings of your preference. For me, a double cheeseburger on the toasted, buttered bun with \"everything\" (mustard, pickle, and onion) is the burger I enjoy most. The Galley Boy which is a double cheeseburger with barbecue sauce and tartar sauce is probably the most popular sandwich.

The drive in is pretty unique to Akron and many are unfamiliar with procedure. Basically, lights on for service. If you choose to dine in your car, they'll bring your food out in an indoor or outdoor tray depending on the weather. If paying by credit card, they'll run your payment through when you receive your food. Turn on your lights when your finished, they'll take your tray, and you're sure to leave happy.

There are plenty of fried sides to choose from to go with your burger. The fried zucchini with a side of ranch is one of my favorites. If you don't want a burger, there are plenty of other sandwiches including a fried bologna, steak sandwich, and a pulled pork sandwich as options. Often overlooked are the house made chili and vegetable soup which are perfect during the cold winters.

The prices are more than fair and the average person can get an entire meal for around $10. The curb boys/girls will always hustle and you will never be waiting on them for service. Just remember, they must be in school to work there and your tip will be appreciated greatly. Swensons is unique experience and I highly recommend if you're looking for great tasting, yet economical meal."}
{"text":"Always 5 star awesome great tasting food and these servers hustle so tip them generously. Super fast service , and you must try the Galley boy burger it's the highlight of this place. I don't like onion rings too much but there's are great breathing is crunchy , they put the tray on the side of your car old school. Give em a try you'll love em ."}
{"text":"What can you say about the number 1 burger place. New trendy burger places come and go.

Swenson has stayed the test of time. How many places can say they have served 4 generation. You got your license Swenson was one of the places you headed to.

I recommended everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Saturday - 7pm

With the Cavs winning the championship, I read on Facebook someone saw Lebron at this restaurant. As a result, I looked it up on Yelp and per the great reviews decided to give it a try. 

First off, I was a little disappointed because I thought from the description of the food that it might be more old-fashioned looking, like a 50's drive in. It's not. Brick square building, numbered parking spots and to further disappoint me, no outdoor seating whatsoever. It's a \"drive in\" I know. But with a dog in the car and having driven some distance to get there, picnic tables on the grass in front would have been nice. 

As for the food? My companion got the much lauded Galley Burger, and he said it was fantastic. I got a coney dog with cheese and can say I've had much, much better. We shared fries that were..... fries, and we each got a milkshake. As someone with a passionate sweet tooth, I'll say that if a strawberry shake from Swenson's doesn't satisfy it, nothing will. I mean I like sweet, but this was omgtoothache sweet, like, can I have it with a side of insulin please? 

Overall I wouldn't really go out of my way to return here. It's good and yeah if I was over that way I'd go but living in Ohio City, there are many options locally that could fill the same function as Swensons. Your mileage as they say, may vary."}
{"text":"First time to a Swenson's, I'm from Florida so we don't have these down there. Service was quick and friendly. The food was delicious, I ordered a bacon cheese burger and it was a lot better than I expected it would be. I also had these tater tot like things with cheese and jalape√±os in them, yum! I will definitely be returning when we visit Ohio again."}
{"text":"This place is good enough that I have been going there on and off for almost 10 years.

I am not crazy about their galley boy, but that is more a like it or like it to the point of never ordering anything else burger. Most my friends only go with that one.

I just prefer the  double or triple cheeseburger with everything. Potato teasers on the side.
I think it is brown sugar they use if you are trying to recreate the sweetness/signature taste at home.

Back to the review, really anything on their menu seems to be fine.

If in area, choose this over Sonic."}
{"text":"My first time in Akron and I was hungry for a burger. I found Swensons nearby and ordered a \"Galley Boy in a Basket\" which is a double burger with 2 sauces, a skewered green olive on top, with a side of fries and coleslaw. The downside of this place was that the fries were soggy. Overall a great spot for a quick burger."}
{"text":"Working just a few miles from this place is bad.  Really, really, bad for my arteries. I can get wonderful Galley Boy cheeseburgers and perfectly cooked fries any day that I'd like.

When I mentioned to my coworkers that I had lived in Cleveland for almost 3 years now and had yet to try Swenson's several months ago, they freaked.  \"How could youuu!?  You must go.  And now!\" So I did.  

The burgers really may be the best ones I've ever tasted - I don't know what they do to them but they really are addictive."}
{"text":"2 Galley boys, potato teezers, mint strawberry banana chocolate malt.  Cajun on the teezers with side o ranch. Damn I'm fat"}
{"text":"These are easily the best hamburgers ever. The potato puffs are awesome. The fries are decent. Everything on the menu is good. There is no reason to order anything besides the burgers unless you are really hungry and thinking about what else would taste good. It is worth driving here every time. I still have to try Skyway though."}
{"text":"All I have to say is if you have not tried the galley boy, you are missing out! I like the potato with the jalapeno in them and always have a tough decision between the California and Florida drink."}
{"text":"Great food quick efficient service. The best.  I often stop here on my way home from work for  a Galley boy, fry and small rootie with no ice.   The service is fast and the food is piping hot even  in freezing temps.    If you have not tried the Swensons, give it a try, do your self a favor, enjoy the deliciousness that has arrived in University Hts, OH.  Please hold the straw."}
{"text":"Blah. Overated.greasy.dont eat unless you are to drunk to taste it. But America likes this stuff. How can anyone argue that"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here for the first time and were quite surprised on how much we liked the service was great the food was good and oh yeah it was CHEAP I  definitely will be a repeat customer when ever in the area!!"}
{"text":"This place has been around for 80 years now. Its the best in the city. Drive-in, car hops (that still run!) And great food. Kevin makes great suggestions but you can't go wrong with anything you order. 

I would suggest a double cheeseburger (MKOLETMAYO) with French fries (crispy) and a milkshake! 

Favorite place in the world! YUM!"}
{"text":"I just don't understand what all the hype was about.

The service there is outstanding, those kids are definitely earning their money.  Your car almost gets attacked upon arrival.  It's not a bad thing.  But, these kids are running around in a dead sprint, so you should really be very careful upon entry/exit of the parking lot, They don't seem to be very aware of their surroundings.

The burger was uninspiring.  Bun had a little bit of a sweet taste to it.  Very thin patties.  Didn't taste bad, but was not even close to In-n-Out or Whataburger.  Cheese had almost no flavor to it at all.  Honestly, I've even had better burgers at Mc Donald's.  

Onion Rings.  Flat out terrible.  Way too much breading, no flavor, barely traces of an onion inside and overcooked to add insult to injury.  Fries weren't terrible, but not great, either.  The Potato Puffs, nothing more than bland \"tater-tots\".  I didn't try one of their \"famous\" shakes.  

Maybe this place was great many years ago and I know is iconic in Northern Ohio.  Lots of nostalgia as many people revere this place.  Similarly how Californians and Texans romanticize In-n-Out and Whataburger, respectively.  That said, you're not really missing anything and I have no idea why this place is rated among the \"Best Burgers in America\".  While I don't have three chins, I still know what a good burger is, and this place isn't it."}
{"text":"I don't dislike Swensons. The servers tearing at full speed to the cars is entertaining, the prices are reasonable and the food is OK.I don't quite get the passion that others have for the place, though. Guess you had to grow up there.

If, like me, you didn't, it's still worth a visit. Local places like this with quirky offerings should be encouraged."}
{"text":"Better than Sonic. I only had fries and a Xango, but i would go here over Sonic a million times. It just felt right. Sonic seemed fake. Is it the hometown angle? Maybe. The fries were fresh tasting and not Sysco(though i was kind of in the mood for that). The xango is a McDonald's apple pie only flakier and filled with cheesecake goo. Superb. I'd never been to a Swenson's before as it is so trendy. But i'm sold. Especially since this one is so close. I thought they were only in Summit county. Staff is really nice and fast with the grub. Place was hopping on a Sunday night at ten, which makes my boring life a little bit funner."}
{"text":"It's 8¬∞ out and these kids are still running!!! First time here so we tried a bit of everything. All fried deliciousness! Little disappointed with the fried bologna. Thick chunk that barely fried. Shake was phenomenal! I'm sure I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Burger came out almost red in the center and cold. Fries were not fully cooked. Replacement burger had so much ketchup and mayo on it that the burger was inedible awash in a sea of condiments. The staff was friendly- this was not one of the cooks better days. We love Swenson's but this night was not one to remember with anything but disappointment."}
{"text":"Been seeing and hearing about Swensons. Finally my fianc√©e and brother stopped in this week. We were surprised with the fast service and the really cheap prices. We just ordered regular cheeseburgers with everything , frys and sloppy joe to test them out. Did not disappoint. We will definitely be coming back here for a long time."}
{"text":"I had been to the Akron location some years back. I have to say it was just like I remember it. I'm so glad there is a location close to my house now. I got the galley boy and it has a distinct better taste from your average fast food hamburger. My mom got the sloppy joe and said it was great for a fast food place considering not many have them. The fries were wonderful - nice and hot and crispy. We also ordered the cinnamon milkshakes which were the specialty milkshake at the time. The website said they still had eggnog milkshakes and I wish that would have been updated and I knew beforehand they didn't have them anymore because I got excited once I saw the ad online. The service was great. We went on a busy Friday night, actually the Friday before the grand opening, and we didn't have to wait long for anything. Overall, nice people, great service and great food!"}
{"text":"I had never been to Swensons before. My first experience was a hopping one! I was barely in the parking spot before s young girl came running at my car to take my order! I felt rushed- I hadn't even looked at the menu board. But since I had been looking online prior to arrival my family and I had a general idea of what we wanted. We placed our order and as fast as our waitress had appeared she also ran into the building to place our order. The kids working here run and run and make sure they're on top of everything. I generously tipped after watching them hustle. I got the grilled chicken sandwich which was ok, everyone else in my party ordered burgers which they raved about. I will definitely come back and get a burger. Overall this was a pretty good experience, especially since we ate in the car!"}
{"text":"Where to start here... Best burgers in the greater NE OH area, hands down. May even be the best burgers known to man, you should try and get back to me with your opinion, which I'm sure will be the same as mine unless you have the palate of a former carney fire-eater, or Detroit dumpster-diving hobo. 

I enjoy the service as much as the food, its a real blast from the past type feel. Your servers run up to your car to take your order, when I say run, I mean they literally are required to run to your ride. No sloppy bums working here, only the best of the best. When your food arrives they have the tray that attaches to your door for less mess and easier eating while in your car. 

Burgers have a hint of what tastes like brown sugar, its heavenly whatever it is. They have an enormous list of milk shakes, all amazing. Theres nothing like being able to sit in your car, people watch and enjoy a meal simultaneously. Any place with tater tots available aside from fries is the place to be in my book. If you ever happen to be sitting around pondering the thought of how the best burger in the world tastes, swing on down to Swensons!"}
{"text":"Service is awesome, the burgers are awesome, and thanks to one of their employees suggestions, my new favorite menu item is the potato teasers with Cajun seasoning. So delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's only down the road so I go quite a bit. The galley boy is a staple here and a great burger. Can't go wrong with the onion rings or my personal favorite the potatoes teasers. I always order the California grape/lemon drink as well. The service is great no matter how busy they are and the prices are low. I love living so close to this place."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service! I've been coming here for years, and we still find an excuse to visit! You have to try the Galley Boy, and a milkshake! This is the best place in the area for a burger, by far!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. What a treat this place is! We were here recently and simply loved it so much. You cannot beat the idea of a drive up where someone scurries to your car and takes your order while you leisurely sit and relax and wait for your food. So great.

As for the food, delicious. Old school cheeseburgers and fries and mozzarella sticks, hot dogs, shakes, and even salads and the good old shrimp basket. They have something for every single person here. We decided on the Galley Boy and some fries. The sauce on this was amazing and we were so happy. Also, we added in some onion rings and a salad. The o rings were great and the salad was good as well. Not the greatest, but what can I expect from a burger drive in?

To finish off our meals, we had some vanilla and strawberry milkshakes. They were so creamy and delicious that I still think about them as I type. The service is quick and efficient as each server runs back and forth to get your order and then deliver this. Boy, they are in good shape to do this!

While I wish there was a Swensons in Solon, I am happy that there is not! I would surely weigh 200 pounds by the time summer is over. Such a great place and worth the trip to eat there."}
{"text":"Being from California, this reminded me of Sonic's system, where you pull up and order from your car. However, this place has a little more of a retro feel, also because its been around way longer than Sonic (sorry for the comparison). It was midnight, we just got done dancing our tails off at a wedding, and were starving! We ordered up two Galley Boy burgers, zucchini fries and the potato teasers. 

This was my first time trying the Galley Boy, which is THE burger to get, two patties, creamy melty American cheese, two sauces (mayo and bbq, i think) and all in the perfect handheld size. We scarfed the items once they arrived to the car - these boys run their hearts out, and they still have a smile! Power to em, I respect what they do."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first experience at a Swensons and I was not disappointed! The food was awesome! I had the traditional cheeseburger, potato puffs, and fries. My friend had the ever popular Galley Boy and potato teasers. All of the food was to die for! Our favorite part was the milkshake combination our waiter/runner suggested - banana root beer. Sounds strange, yes, but it was SO GOOD. 

Our waiter/runner, Dominic, was phenomenal. He was so knowledgeable, honest, and kind. Being my first time, I wasn't sure what to order and he gave me some great options to choose from that I ultimately ended up picking and loved! His customer service and attentiveness was above and beyond any other \"fast food\" service I've experienced.

I'll definitely be back and would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"There are 3 things you need to know about Swensons.

1. It's not expensive.

2. Their burgers are amazing, especially the Galley Boy.

3. LeBron James eats at Swensons all of the time and he won an NBA Championship for Ohio.

In conclusion, you will save money, enjoy your meal, and possibly become a world champion."}
{"text":"I would give them six stars if available. First off, they sprint to your car. Secondly, you don't even get out of your car. You can sit and relax in your car, and not even worry about what the weather is outside, or waiting for service. The menu is not fancy at all, and has fairy normal menu options. The difference is the food. Their burgers are sweet tasting, and the buns are crispy and soft at the same time. In my opinion, the best burgers in the northeast ohio area I have tried. They also have a plethora of side items including a \"potato teaser\" that is a glorified tator tot with jalapeno pieces inside them. If you need a quick meal, and are in the mood for burgers, look no further. I would get at least 3 though if hungry, they do run a little smaller than most."}
{"text":"After living in Ohio for 7 years I was introduced to Swensons this past weekend and it was so amazing I had it two days in a row. To summarize- this place is amazing. I am addicted. Delicious burgers, fries and everything else. Huge menu, AMAZING prices, fast friendly service. I hate to admit it but they give In-N-Out a serious run for their money! I went to the Cuyahoga Falls location first and the Stow/Kent location the next day and both were great."}
{"text":"Fast service. Amazing food. Reasonable prices. I will always return when I am home in ohio. I highly recommend the potato teasers."}
{"text":"I love swensons! Very tasty burgers and milkshakes, and the staff is super friendly! They are open a little later than other restaurants, so it's nice if you need to grab a bite a little later into the night."}
{"text":"I still don't understand why people like this so much.... it must be the novelty of having a place where the waiters come out to your car.

I tried their prize winning burger, and, honestly, I found it very bland (not to be harsh but I like burgerking more).  The dog was small for the price, but I did like their milkshakes alot as thick as they were."}

I always get the quarter pounder plus, onion rings and a California is a must! Their burgers do have a sweet taste, which i actually like. Service is always super fast and friendly. I only wish they had more locations in northeast Ohio."}
