{"text":"For my first review I'll be honest...

We'll start with the positives:
1. The humus was tasty & not too pricy. 
2. The drinks were strong!!!
3. It had lots of large T.V.'s for a sports bar. 

Now for the not so positives:
1. The parking lot is ridiculously intsy tiny. 
2.We were the biggest table there & the service got progressively worse.
3. My drink was only refilled when I asked.
4. The place kinda smelled like a dirty diaper. 
5. It took forever to get our tab.

Overall, I will not be returning to this place unless the serve improves & the parking lot grows!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Blue Moon Sports Grill for a couple of years and the food is ALWAYS fantastic! I have seen some not so good reviews by others about the food and I think a lot of it is because people do not know much about Mediterranean Cuisine. If you know you don't like it or if you are not the type of person that is open to trying different types of food, this place also grills up some very tasty burgers and other \"bar grill\" types of food. However, if you do like Mediterranean food (which is this places specialty) or want to try it, I highly recommend a Gyro plate and the Falafels.  

Over the course of the two or so years that I have been eating here the food is always consistent. Every time I have friends or family in town I take them here and we always leave full and happy. The beer is always fresh and cold. I don't know why, but the Blue Moon always tastes so much better here. 

The atmosphere is warm and inviting. It is a perfect mix between a fine dining restaurant and a fun sports bar. They have large HD TV's and projectors in perfect locations so that no matter where you sit you see all the action. The seats and barstools are very comfortable and they have marble countertops and nice furniture. These little details may seem insignificant to some, however I feel like these are the things that make my dining experience that much better. 

The service is always friendly. I have spoken with the owner John many times and he and his staff are always very friendly. 

That concludes my review. If you happen to be in the area of 12th ST & Northern, I highly recommend you check this place out."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I came back here a third time other than it's close to the office and I was thinking wishfully that maybe it would be better than the last time...but no.  Nothing was terrible, but nothing was great either.  The gyro salad was OK.  The yogurt dip is runny and only moderately tasty.  The falafel on the other hand was pre-made patties that look like they came out of a freezer - not so yummy.  The appetizer try also had nothing that rang my bell.  Prices don't seem that expensive on the menu, but each time I've been there I think \"I paid this much for...that?\".

Service has always been fine - pleasant and timely.  I never encountered the smells others mentioned, and it's clean.  With so many other options... I probably won't be there again."}
{"text":"We went to try a new restaurant and gladly report that we can't always base the quality and service of a place on just one person's opinion.  Admittedly, we were a little leary to try.

IT WAS AWESOME.  Our service was incredible.  Our waiter was friendly and made awesome recommendations.  Our family ordered a large variety of food and we honesty had everything come out at a perfect temperature and the taste, quality and quantity were all great!

Perhaps because other people thought it was hot the restaurant responded and had the air on to excess. We were actually cold.

We would go there again!"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed to read the reviews below. Almost all those reviewers went there as a group, went one time, there happened to be a bad smell that day, and they derailed this place by all posting horrible reviews. Essentially, they're severely unbalancing the rating system by doing this \"en masse\" approach.

I used to eat here several years back when it was just a restaurant. I was sad when it burned up, but didn't try the new sports bar (owned by the same man) until last night, when my wife and I went in for \"beer and hummus\".

I was shocked by how spacious the place is, given the nondescript look from the outside. There was no odor at all in the place; whatever problem was occurring with the reviews above has apparently been fixed. The food was the same fresh, authentic Mediterranean fare that was served when the establishment was merely a restaurant. I was very impressed by the television layout - there were ten large screens positioned perfectly for watching multiple games - this would be an ideal place to watch March Madness. The service was great, and the owner came over and chatted with us for awhile.

Prices are standard for Phoenix sports bars. Parking is admittedly small, but there's not much they can do about that save buying out the AM/PM next door. I suppose you could easily park across the street in the large shopping center.

In summary, I'm sad to read the reviews above - I was excited when I saw the place, and told the owner I would be back with my friends to watch the next sporting event. All it needed was a few more people to make it a lively, fun place."}
{"text":"I really wanted a gyro last night and this place came up on a search.  Since its about a mile from my house and we drive by it all the time, decided to give it a try.  Walked in about 6:15 pm and we were the only ones there, kinda worried us for a minute, but we sat anyway.  
Our waitress was great and very attentive.
We both ended up ordering an \"open faced\" gyro and instead of each of us getting a side, decided to split the Greek fries, along with a beer.
A previous reviewer was right, it took a long time to get our food, especially since we were the only 2 there.  However..  It was well worth the wait!  These gyros were delicious!  Pitas were fresh, lots of meat, fresh onions,  tzatziki sauce on the side.. These also had feta cheese, a good addition, and the usual tomatoes.  Due to an \"accident\" in the kitchen our Greek fries had to be remade, these also took a while to get, we were more than half done our pitas by the time we got them but oh so worth the wait!  Hot, crispy, with a little lemon sauce, feta cheese, delicious!
Will definitely be back to try more.  Go!"}
{"text":"This local hole in the wall is a fun Mediterranean spot. The restaurant is spacious, has a pool table and is clean. We stopped by after doing yard work all afternoon (aka we were hungry). We got the Blue Moon burger and Gyro. Both were very good! Also a nice perk: happy hour is 11am-6pm!"}
{"text":"The best Greek food in the valley! Friendly service from Owner/Chef, John. The chicken is so tender. How does he do it?! The Hummus is yummy. The pitas are always warm and fresh. I especially love the Greek Salad with chicken. The Baklava is delicious! Chad M. is right - the iced tea, even THE ICED TEA is good! I eat here at least five times a week."}
{"text":"Healthy, delicious food served by the on-site owner who is handsome and as nice as could be! Don't believe those bad reviews, those girls do not know what they are talking about. This is the kind of local business we need to support!"}
{"text":"Coworker and I popped in to get the lunch special to go.  It was good and a good deal!  Place was clean, quiet and the staff was nice.  Food came out quickly.  Food was correct.  Food was good.  Yay!!!!!"}
{"text":"Well.. where do I start? First, with a confession: I called Blue Moon to get the ladies night specials and I practically handed them an opportunity to blow our socks off tonight. I told him that we had a large group coming and that we would be reviewing their establishment. Fair warning right? Almost an unfair advantage if you ask me! 

Well I walked in and immediately noticed the smell. It was like dirty old dish water.. others said it was like a dirty diaper. I also was hit by the HEAT in the place. I thought maybe I was just warm from walking to the place, no... it was seriously like a sauna. I was sweating...no one makes me sweat unless I'm going to enjoy it. I wasn't enjoying this. 

I was so warm and the smell turned me off that I ended up not eating a thing. My buddies were better sports than I was and went ahead and ordered food. No one was impressed by the food. 

Our service started out great, but then it was like she got bored or overwhelmed and people were left sitting with empty plates and bottles littering the table. 

I probably won't bother trying Blue Moon again. It's too bad, I was hoping that it would be a little gem in my hood."}
{"text":"I am glad I didn't read some of these reviews before I tried out this place!  It was very good! 

Lentil soup was YUMMY...and I am not much of a lentil soup guy.

I had the Gyro and my wife had the falafel.  Very nicely seasoned and the flavor was there.  My wife's falafel was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside (as it should be).  She said that it reminded her of the falafel she got when she was on vacation in Israel. 

The only bad thing about the place is that it only has like 8 parking spots out front.  I spoke with the owner and one of his customers who came in for a pickup order and he said that he has been getting food from here for 15 years."}
{"text":"If looking for good food this is the place. I have ordered Mediterranean food from similar restaurants in a 3 mile radius, you can't beat the quality of the food. If your looking for dining atmosphere.. this is not the place. The place is a sports bar...tv screens are every where. The parking lot is small... but you never have to fight for a place to park or have to wait very long for an order. I have been ordering from this place for over 2 years. We get take out at least twice a month."}
{"text":"Uhhhh, yeah this place was not good for me. I didn't care about the parking, I just parked in front of some guy's house next door. Thanks buddy.

As for the smell, yeah it wasn't good, but that alone would not warrant a bad review. I might just suggest a Glade plug-in or 5.

The environment was bright, sterile & oddly quiet. Maybe because it was mostly empty. This pace is definitely not warm & cozy. Losing points.

I was hungry & trying to search the menu for dinner choices. When I told the waitress I was still deciding & started to ask her a question about a menu item, she literally walked off while I was in mid sentence. The girl next to me started laughing & so did I. Maybe she didn't hear me, but it was obvious she wasn't listening either. Food was basic, but nothing special.

Luckily I was only having 2 drinks, because the waitress would disappear for long stretches of time. At some point the 2 other tables left & our table of 10+ people were the only table in there. So why did our service suck so bad? Not sure.....

The service just blew, period, bottom line. I imagined the waitress in the back watching a Lifetime movie or something, she certainly wasn't paying that much attention to our table. When I was ready to leave, I waited over 10 minutes for the waitress to come from the back & she came out chewing a huge mouthful. As she chewed it, she said \"sorry candy\" ughh. 

I am all for supporting local businesses, but this one needs some serious fixing. Instead of the owners responding by asking people to put up good reviews, maybe try addressing some of the problems. Just saying...."}
{"text":"At first we were like...  this is a bar, but still went in. I'D crisis....  but once we got the Hummus we were hooked.   Gyro was awesome.. I would get the fries and not the salad. Salad was not dressed and plain. Just needs a Greek dressing and that would fix it. Tadzhik sauce was awesome!   Try this place for Greek food.  Not to bad."}
{"text":"I work in the area and decided to try Blue Moon today.  I too, am glad I didn't read the former reviews because my experience was very different.  I had a lunch special Greek Salad with warm pita bread.  It was very good--light, crisp lettuce and vine-red tomatoes with just the right amount of dressing on it.  I typically order dressing on the side and this time, I forgot.  Thankfully it arrived absolutely perfect, according to my tastes. Purple cabbage and cucumbers gave it a nice crunch, and the portion size was generous.  The pita bread was wrapped up and warm, and fresh baked.  I'm going to suggest this to my co-workers next week as a new go-to place in the neighborhood.  

PS--there are several TVs inside.  I would consider watching games here and having a beer or two as well!"}
{"text":"This is interesting. This situation happening here...

The two reviewers who are saying the positive things obviously were asked by the owner to respond to the other six reviews. 

Who can blame them? Owning a small business is a challenge. You put your heart and soul into this thing and you expect people to understand and appreciate what you're doing and sometimes they don't and it hurts. 

I happened to be part of the large, drunken group of raging bitches who were pimping hoes and clocking a grip like their names were all Dolomite... 

The deal is the place is a little less than what we're used to as narcissitic, petulant, pedantics. We like FEZ and eclectic downtown spots that the people who patronize Blue Moon don't.  

Vice versa, apparently. 

Blue moon is like whatever. But I hope it's successful because someone cares about it and it's their livelihood and in these times who wouldn't root for a neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"Well what can I say....service (Amy) was awesome, never an empty drink....food was so much more than expected, the gyro was one of the best I have had in quite awhile. My only negative would be that we were told that in about three weeks it will be no more. So if you can try it before it's gone!!!"}
{"text":"On the plus side, you won't have trouble finding a table.  Yours, too, will most likely be vacated before too long.

I had the yogurt and cucumber dip.  I was envisioning thick, zesty Greek-style yogurt with garlic and lemon in the background to compliment the crunchy fresh cucumber.  I got plain ole yogurt (does the Dollar Store sell yogurt?) with cucumber.  Should have paid attention to the name of the dish.  

Also, if something possesses you to actually come here, save yourself the trouble and order a beer.  I tried to order two different call drinks from their bar, but they didn't stock either liquor."}
{"text":"The last time I went to this place I think I was already a little drunk before arriving.  I remember there being better music, and better drinks. I give my night there last night 5 stars only because I was there with an awesome co-worker! But the waiter was snippy. Handed us the menu and told us we had 5 mins to order before they closed the kitchen.  We ordered some of everything...literally because my guy likes to give ppl he buys dinner for an option. I have to say my favorite part was the red headed slut. No not my co-worker! Its like a cranberry peach snapps and jaeger...anyways it was the best. Their beers are great because they don't make them. The cran vodka I ordered was a little watered down..and if we paid for the grey goose...that should have been a good ass drink.  and after our waitress pulled all our food, wasn't even done with my salad...she was tipped 15.00 clearly she didn't deserve it. Whatever this place is Meh."}
{"text":"I like this place... Good hummus... Good salads, healthy pours on drinks... Friendly service...very attentive. Will def be back!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best and freshest Greek food you're going to find in the area! This is my go to gyros place. If I'm not having a draft beer I will have the ice tea. It is my favorite unsweetened ice tea. A subtle note of mint to it and it is always fresh. If I'm getting food to go, I will always have 2-3 glasses of the ice tea while I wait. The gyro is great and never disappoints. The menu just changed slightly and you can now get the gyro as an appetizer, or as a \"sandwich\" on the best pita bread you will find in Phoenix, or as a dinner. I have had each multiple times. I'm not a big fan of feta cheese but the feta they use here I could have on everything. I also love the teriyaki chicken, the chicken kabobs, the beef kabobs and the salad that accompanies the dinner. I am a salad snob and everything has to be extremely fresh for me. The vegetables are the freshest I've had in a restaurant and consistently so. The fresh fries you can get with the gyro sandwich are the thicker square cut style and always hit the mark. I have to try the wings next, my friend loves them.

Ignore the older bad reviews. If you want great FRESH Greek food, this the place to get it in Phoenix. You will not be disappointed with anything you order.

The parking lot can fill up but parking around the corner on the residential street is available as well as across the street. It's worth the walk if the lot is full."}
{"text":"Best Greek food I've had in a long while! I had the shish cabob and it was delicious-great flavor, nice portions, yum! My family ordered a variety of other items but the gyro was hands down the best: melt in your mouth like butter, flavorful and authentic. Want to enjoy a game? Drop in and view the game on one of 9 big screens! Professional service, good food... Support this family owned business!"}
{"text":"Hmm...bad reviews must have been in the same party...these ladies could not be further from the truth! Really good local place with a great friendly owner. Decent authentic Mediterranean food choices and American food has been added too. Great stop for lunch or pop in for just a beer or cocktails.  Have been here numerous times and the only disappointment is more people don't drop in! Give this place a try, you will probably enjoy! Great gyros, try the kababs and spinach puffs for a filling, fair priced dinner."}
{"text":"Bottom line: If you absolutely have no other place to go, then try it. I'd recommend the beer, and don't go hungry since the food is mediocre at best. The atmosphere is off and the motif doesn't quite work as a sports bar. Lastly, it is uncomfortable warm inside."}
{"text":"Live near this restaurant and I order the same thing every time. It tastes different every time! Sometimes it's great sometimes it's not. Jasmine rice not used every time and the spices are either used or dish is very bland. No in between. I pay on average $20 for my meal and my main complaint is that is inconsistent in taste. When I first started going there it was great all the time and the last year or so the food has been mediocre. Not sure why I continue to frequent, but when it's good it's really good! I guess you could call me a gambler!"}
{"text":"One of the best gyros I've ever had- support this local business and eat their delicious food!"}
{"text":"Ok, the first thing I want Yelp visitors to notice is that this is actually a 4-star restaurant if you deduct the infamous 1/13/09 night that inspired a half-dozen young professional women to logon and give this place one star.  Don't get me wrong, I don't doubt their experience was negative, but personally, I don't think you should give one star or five stars to ANY place you have only visited once given that statistics suggest that your extraordinarily good or bad night might be the result of (un)happy coincidence, as opposed to a genuine reflection of the food and consistent service that a particular establishment is capable of. 

That said, I have been to this place approximately 25 times dating back to the 90s, when the restaurant was a very humble dive known as \"Taste of Mediterranean\".   And by humble, I mean humble, as in those awful backlit framed \"paintings\" with \"moving\" waterfalls in them and tacky fountains and lousy bathroom upstairs.  The decor in the 90s was dreadful, but I tolerated it and kept coming back for the food.

Enter Y2K+5.  Taste of Mediterranean burns down, and its proprietor (the NICEST owner/operator in Phoenix) decided to make a go of it and he essentially mortgaged his liver and lungs to rebuild this place with a decidedly modern feel.  Yes, there is something to the criticism that the \"Blue Moon Sports Bar\" has an atmosphere inapposite to genuine sports bars.   And yes, it is a minor miracle that the guys from Coors haven't sent the owner a \"cease and desist\" letter given the restaurant's name and the huge Blue Moon beer banners that often drape the exterior.  But that's all I can really criticize here, because the food (and that's what you are interested in, right?  The Food?) is absolutely FANTASTIC and markedly unique.

The Basmati rice preparation that comes with most combination meals remains untouchable, nobody in Phoenix even comes close, and the portions are heaping.  All of the beef and chicken offerings - Kefte, Sultan, Shish, and the awkwardly appearing \"Teriyaki\" chicken are absolutely 5-star dishes.   They have an American food section on the menu too, including sports bar burgers, but I never wander that far.  But I bet they're good.

I think the neatest part about your Blue Moon experience will be your service.  You see that tall, clean cut guy with the irrepressible smile taking your order?  That's the owner/waiter/bartender, a true and wonderful classic successful (hopefully) immigrant from the Middle East, who is happy to speak to you at length about any topic that comes to mind - including how his (or your) business is going.  Not a shred of pretentiousness in him, the attention your getting from him is sincere and he actually wants to hear about how crappy your life is going!  I love it!   You can tell in an instant that he wants your experience to be a good one, and to the extent he can influence that, he will (read: Heavy and strong liquor pours!)

PROS :  4.5 star FOOD, 4 star DRINKS, BIG-ARSE TV's tuned in to various MAJOR AMERICAN SPORTS (what?!?!?!  No futbol?!?!?!), drink variety, menu diversity.  Rarely packed in terms of capacity, so you get quick service.  Located in underrated apart of Phoenix approaching the very well-known but very rarely visited Dreamy Draw.  Hey, Spy Headquarters is only a half-block away! :)  It's also a stone's throw from Carlos O'Briens if you chicken out in the parking lot and decide you need a name brand joint instead.

CONS:  Parking is tight and counter-intuitive, but go ahead and park on the adjacent residential street.  Really, no one cares if you park there.  Only a matter of time before Coors lawyers try to shut him down or fairly obvious trademark infringement with the use of the name + the strategically placed huge Blue Moon beer banners, so get it while the gettin' is good!

So why not five stars?  Simple:  I honestly don't like Mediterranean food much.  But if I did, this is the one truly reliable place to get it."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I had the gyro and both times they were gigantic and awesome. The beers are very decently priced, they have several tvs for when the games are on and it's very clean. I'll definitely be back for a gyro fix."}
{"text":"Great food and relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the service. The man that is always working there is not friendly and rude to kids. The food is decent. Go to Greek Town near 7th Ave and Butler for better food and service."}
{"text":"Taste of the Mediterranean was a valley favorite since 1987 serving fine Mediterranean and Greek cuisine, which has been closed for the last couple year due to a major fire that damage the building.  Fortunately, through the owner's hard work and dedication he has restored the building, making a few changes inside, but bringing back his classic dishes.  As the new name entails, it is set up with a bar in the middle and several TV screens, but still offers elegant comfortable seating for those wanting a nice dining experience.  The owner is one of the nicest restaurateurs you will ever meet and always checks up on his customer to make sure they are enjoying themselves.  The menu is a bit more expensive than my previous recommendations with most the entrees ranging from $9 to $20, but the portions are plentiful.  Then menu features salads, soups, kabobs, mousaka, gyros and other meat dishes.  For vegetarians there are veggie kabobs, falafels, stuffed grape leaves and hummus. My favorite is the Sultan Kabob, which I have yet to find anything that compares to it anywhere else."}
{"text":"I had the teriyaki chicken and it was good!  The pitas were awesome. Baklava was amazing. The service was a little slow but the food was made fresh. My husband had a burger that looked like it was a pre made frozen one. 
The employees were friendly and even joined us in our pre meal prayer!"}
{"text":"Everything I've ever ordered here is delicious my favorite is most definitely the gyro chicken kebab platter"}
{"text":"I feel bad about writing this review....it was great for to have this get together tonight (and it definitely wasn't our host's fault), but there were so many things wrong with this place.

First of all, I will say the positive....AWESOME time with the girls and boys.

Now...I have no idea how I ate my plate of french fries (with feta and olive oil...which I had to tell the waitress about...not her fault)  because the whole place smelled like a nasty dirty diaper.  Also...could it get an hotter in there?  We asked to turn the heat down or air conditioning up...and it just kept on getting hotter and hotter...I was sweating profusely.

Service was meh and my drink had NO VODKA in it....pure grapefruit juice I tell you.  And the parking lot?  If it was full (there were like 8 parking spots) I would have left.

It was strange seeing a Greek themed restaurant as a Sports Grill.  Somehow those two things just don't go together at all."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been frequenting this establishment since before it was Blue Moon Sports Grill.  It used to be known as Taste of Mediterranean, before suffering damage from a major fire. The \"regulars\" who loved it, came out in droves to help the owner get back on his feet, and encouraged construction on the new establishment. After a long wait, Zulfu (the owner - or John as some call him) re-opened the restaurant with a new name, a huge bar, and the same great food. 

I was very disappointed to read so many negative reviews. We have never encountered a bad smell, and we are always happy with our meals. I usually get the The Basmati rice melts in your mouth. It is delicious. The mead is always tender and spiced just right. Also, the rice pudding is a must for dessert. It is DIVINE. Everything from the hummus & pita to the Kabobs, to the gyros & fries is ALWAYS great. This is one of the reasons we choose to go back. The other reason is because of th owner, and his outstanding customer service. He is a hard-working, humble, and sincere man, who produces a great product, and that is always grateful for our patronage. 

I was not asked to give this review, I just chose to because we love this place so much. It doesn't have to be fancy, it just has to be good. And that is exactly what Blue Moon Sports Grill is."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place just a tad more credit than the other ladies... but it was still pretttty bad. 

First of all, the parking situation is not good. The building is really tall, and the 10-spot parking lot squished in there makes it look like a Monopoly house. 

Second, as previously mentioned, the place stinks like farts. I figured that it was just someone around me because it didn't smell that bad when I first walked in, but when I moved to another seat at the table, it was still there .. and perhaps stronger. Either there is a dead rat in the ceiling or someone at our table is a serious crop duster. 

Third, the food was a little overpriced and the taste certainly was unjustifiable. The grape leaves came warm. I am no Greek aficionado, but of the numerous times I have had grape leaves, they have never, ever been served warm. The hummus was okay, but the falafel was pretty dry. All and all, the \"Veggie Platter\" was quite the disappointment, especially for $14.95. 

Finally, our waitress was extremely attentive in the beginning, but as the night progressed, she seemed to have slacked off and lost interest in our table, despite the fact that there were only a few small tables in the restaurant. I mean, we had 10 or 12 people, you would think that we would have been taken care of! 

I did enjoy my vodka tonic. It was a good pour. 

The bathroom was clean, but the decor in this place (light colored tiles, high ceilings, kind of reminded me of an unfinished Vegas Hotel Lobby) didn't exactly match the \"Greek\" or \"Sports Bar\" motif, so I was a little confused what they were going for. 

Oh well, we tried."}
{"text":"I don't think this place is awful, it's just not my thing.  It's a rebuild from a place that burned down a few months ago.  Inside looks like a mix between a sports bar and a middle eastern restaurant.  The food is average. That's what I say, and that's what everyone else around me said.   

If I was in the neighborhood and needed a beer I'd go back, but I wouldn't search this place out, like I said it's just not my thing."}
{"text":"Really great food ... First visit to the neighborhood space ,, Greek American .. Angus hamburgers (really inexpensive before 5.30), great happy hour prices - until 6.30... Gyro, grape leaves spanikopita, good stuff - 6 sports stations, music , horseshoe shaped bar with tables available."}
{"text":"There really isn't much more to add- I think everyone has already summed it up perfectly. 

Just.Don't.

It's stinky pot pie!

Dottsy gave them a HUGE advantage and they blew it. If it wasn't for the great company, they would have lost me at the parking lot."}
{"text":"Great local business owned by a great guy. I love to support these small businesses and Blue Moon has great food and a wonderful atmosphere. I don't drink so am hesitant to go into bars alone. I can go in anytime to the Blue Moon for a snack or dinner and know the food will be great and the owner will fawn over me. 

I eat well at the Blue Moon and the owner treats me like a friend. What more can I ask?"}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal!!!  It's quiet enough to have a conversation that can be heard and has several TVs so any game you want to see can be watched!  There is always a seat available at the bar and the owner and staff are personable and friendly.  But the food is the bottom line, it's all excellent!"}
{"text":"Great food for me and the family! Generous portions----love the chicken pita. The lentil soup is tasty, and I found  the Lemoncello pie----Amazingingly light and yummy!  Quality of food is excellent. We've started eating here at least once a week! :)"}
