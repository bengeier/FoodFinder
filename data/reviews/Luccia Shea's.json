{"text":"Family owned   Best kept secret in Monroeville. If you like GOOD food at reasonable prices this place can't be beat. And it's no smoking. Good or bad you decide that. It's worth the trip from no matter where you live."}
{"text":"Wow,  I had a fabulous lunch at Luccia Shea's.  Every thing was scrumptious from the italian bread, fresh brewed iced tea, fresh colorful salad with homemade dressing, and OMG the homemade delectable portobella  ravioli and Sherry cream sauce ! Wonderful service, amazing desserts.  We will be back as soon as possible.  There is Route 22 construction all around but definitely worth navigating Penndot to get there.  Family owned : met them!  So much better than any of the italian chain restaurants."}
{"text":"I have driven by this restaurant many times.  I finally was invited there as a guest of a Priest friend of mine.  The food is fantastic.  Scott, his Mother Marie and the wait staff is wonderful.  They offered advice, made suggestions, and took great care of our group.  I have been back three times now and have not been disappointed.  Try the prosciutto and arugala stuffed ravioli and the limoncello cake!  YUMMY"}
{"text":"This little place is absolutely amazing. We stopped after our long travels from south dakota back home to philly and it was by far the BEST italian food I've ever had outside of a home cooked meal . I am 100% italian and it is very hard to eat italian out but I would literally come to this place once a week if it was closer to home. I had the pasta and white clams and it was perfect not one grain of sand and the clams are great quality the best I've had and the escarole and bean soup tastes just like my grandma's which is hard to even say, my fiance had Alfredo and I tried it and that was also perfect and the portions are big and money well spent. Also if u love spicy get the stuffed banana peppers ..they were Def spicy but delicious. I hope they stay in business forever."}
{"text":"Outstanding food. My wife and I stop here a few times a year and food and service are always perfect"}
{"text":"Food was very good, but overpriced. Stuffed peppers were spicy and tasty.  Clam sauce (I asked to have it made without cream) was very good.  Spinach ravioli also very good - huge portion.  Dinner salad - Meh.  Escarole and bean soup, good.  Service was quick, server was friendly. But the check was $84 -- so $100 with tip.  And that's too high for that sort of food.  Given lower prices, we would eat there frequently!"}
{"text":"Stopped her by default after walking out of another restaurant along 22. I have passed this place by thousands of times without even thinking to stop. But last night we did stop and were very pleasantly surprised. Although the initial musty smell hit me as we entered, it left just as quickly as it passed by my nose. The bartender was welcoming and friendly and told us to sit anywhere we liked. It was a bit early, 5:45 or so. We read the menu with delicious sounding dishes and asked some questions. Since we had a late lunch, we decided to just do appetizers. They were perfect! My friends had Artichokes Romano, a lemony lightly breaded dish and Stuffed Banana Peppers in a tangy tomato sauce. I had Drunken Mushrooms which were very popular, I was told. They were mushrooms on a slice of Italian Bread and cheese covered in a most lip smacking sherry cream sauce. Yum! We also sampled the beef barley soup and the escarole white bean soup. Both were delicious. Many good beers on tap. I had Stella Artois and my friend had Newcastle. We will definitely stop here again when we are hungrier to try out the pastas and the made to order steaks. The staff was friendly, knowledgable and efficient. Couldn't ask for more."}
