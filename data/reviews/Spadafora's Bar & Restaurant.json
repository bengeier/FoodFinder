{"text":"We visited Spadafora's the first week it opened and was very disappointed.  My husband had undercooked scallops surrounded by mashed potatoes!  A friend of mine visited for lunch and was also disappointed.  After driving by Spadafora's for the last several weeks, we all noticed more cars in the parking lot and a sign that proclaimed \"best Italian Restaurant from Pittsburgh Magazine\"  My friends and I decided to give it another chance.  We have a girls night out for dinner once a month and like to visit local eateries rather than the chain restaurants.  There were 4 of us and were seated at a table that could seat four if the chairs were placed on all 4 sides of the table.  However, the ownership placed two chairs side by side, leaving the other sides  of the tables open. If we would have tried to eat, we would have been bumping each other.   We asked the waitress if we could move the chairs around and she said go right ahead and make yourself comfortable which we did.  While we were eating, a gentleman came over to us (we think it was the owner)  and asked if we could move our table around so he could seat a party of three at a table beside ours  that could barely seat two at best.  He wanted to put the third chair right beside our table.The chairs actually would have been back-to-back.    We tried moving the table around but now we were blocking the diners to our right.  He gave up and the folks had to wait until a table opened up.  (Not an unusual occurrence in a busy restaurant).

We were all OK with the fact that the restaurant is tightly packed with barely enough room to move between the tables.  We were comfortable where we were.  But we were really annoyed that our comfort and the comfort of the folks dining to our right was going to be compromised by the owner trying to shoehorn three people in a space that was barely suitable for two.  We all wanted to love this restaurant and put it on a \"must do again\" list - we all live rather close and it's nice to frequent a neighborhood restaurant, but felt the owner was more interested in jamming another paying customer in rather than risk them walking out the door due to their inability to immediately get a table.  Our comfort did not matter at this time, since we were already eating our dinner and payment was assured.  

If you go, plan on being very close to your fellow diners and you may be asked to share your table with strangers!!

The food was OK.  I had the gnocchi with the pink sauce.  The sauce was good, the gnocchi was heavy.  My friends liked their dinners - veal parm, lasagna and Mediterranean pasta.  House salads were ho-hum.  Wine list is not very extensive."}
{"text":"Entered into a small, bright and bustling dining room with a bar, which turned out to be the whole place.  For some reason that was surprising to me.  We happened to be greeted by the super sweet owner and he advised to get the seafood linguine and the chicken parm.  The linguine did not disappoint, all of the seafood was perfectly cooked and the sauce was sweet and lovely.  Date got the veal saltimbocca, which didn't have quite as nice of a presentation, but was tasty.  Nice and reasonably priced wine list. 

I sort of felt like it was more of a really nice place to come with family or a group, but not the most romantic of settings, luckily date was still a charmer.   Everyone seemed to know everyone, and it would prob be one of my fave places to go too if I lived out that way as it seems to be one of the few good non-chain and delicious places to eat."}
{"text":"I am only giving this three stars based on the fact that we ate their for our wedding anniversary on a Friday night - which was a mistake.  Because it is so small with tile flooring and metal chairs as well as a bar with TV I had to literally shout across the two-seat table to my wife.  Not the most intimate of settings.  BUT if you are going for GREAT food at GREAT prices with a good wine and beer list - then this is the place for you!  Second time we have eaten there and although the food was not as good as the first time (I would say 3 1/2 star this time - 5 last time!) it is still worth the visit.  The Spady salad is great and the meal portions and service were above average.  Highly recommend for average night out or bigger celebrations - just not a \"romantic\" dinner setting."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite on recommendation of someone else. Service was attentive and friendly. Had the stuffed banana peppers and Chicken Romano. On the plus side the chicken dish was excellent and did not have the usual egg batter. Instead it was a light cream sauce that was very flavorful and the chicken was cooked perfectly and tender.. I guess I was spoiled by the stuffed peppers made at Franco's years ago in the Waterworks area because nobody else seems to match up. Meat filling was a little tough and the peppers were not seeded. However the red sauce was REALLY good so I have to go back to try more of their pasta dishes. Did have a side of spaghetti with meat sauce and it was good. Italian bread was bountiful and good flavor although I personally like a harder crust. I will definitely go back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Best Italian in all of the North Hills!  Try the mozzarella wheel appetizer- stunningly delicious.  I love the gnocchi in pink sauce here.  I have tried all of the local Italian restaurants, and Spaddy's is definitely the best by far."}
{"text":"What a wonderful little place!  I emphasize, little place.  It is quite small inside, but the wonderful food makes up for it!!  

We started off with the Stuffed Banana Peppers and Calamari.  I honestly have NEVER tasted such amazing Calamari in my life!  (Maybe in Italy, but not here)  You have to try them, perfectly battered and lightly fried.  And their marinara sauce was excellent!  The Banana Peppers were very good and very hot!  

Next we had decent salads with tasty dressing.  Then for our entrees Nick had Linguini with White Clam Sauce and I must say it wasn't your typical clam sauce!  I think they put some white wine in it.....it was excellent (as I had to try some).  I got the Veal Romano.  OMG, what a very different way to prepare this dish.  They didn't use eggs and the White Lemon Sauce was incredibile!!!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for Italian and wanted to try something different.  So, we decided to try Spadafora's.  We called on a Saturday afternoon and reserved a table for a later that day.  Parking is a little crowded.  And so was the restaurant.  We were greeted right away by the owner and lead to a banquet tiny table for two.  Service was fairly attentive.  BJ got his usual beer and I had ice tea. 

For our meals, BJ ordered a pasta special with hot sausage and shrimp and I was all about the Lobster Ravioli with Pink Sauce.  Both meals came with soup or salad.  BJ got the Spaddy salad, head lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, shredded provolone & mozzarella cheese, black olives with homemade Italian dressing.  Very fresh and good.  I got the wedding soup.  I liked it.  Loved the italian bread, but it would be even nicer served warm.  I was amazed by my ravioli.  I was expecting about 3 or 4 small pieces, but I got 5 or 6 huge pieces.  It was very good and I really enjoyed the pink sauce.  We were too full for dessert, but everyone around us was loving their pecan balls.  They were huge.  Maybe next time.   I can't wait to try their whole wheat pasta next visit.

We laughed about how typical Western PA this place is.  One family was seated at the bar with their 3 little kids hanging off bar stools.  I bet they call in advance for a table next time."}
{"text":"I took my mother there for Valentine's day/ her birthday. The food was fantastic and so was the service.  Erin was our waitress and she was wonderful. For such a small place this was a great place to take my mother. Also this was my first time there I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident on a long drive and was pleasantly surprised by the zingy, creative menu of Italian comfort food with a splash of western-PA German influence. (Think pumpkin ravioli served with a side of chocolate-covered bacon; huge portions; apple fritters for dessert.) There was a lovely local feel - I think we were the only people in the place who didn't know at least one other customer or member of the staff. Our server was friendly and attentive, and a man who looked like the owner was quietly buzzing around making sure everything was clean and running smoothly. The staff clearly took pride in their restaurant.

Only two minor complaints: 1. the food took a loooong time to come out. I don't think I would have noticed this if our server didn't keep apologizing about it, but once she pointed it out, I realized that she was right. 2. The house-made gnocchi was a little dense and undercooked, though served in a delicious pink sauce.

All in all, a recommended diversion from the Pennsylvania Turnpike if you want something nicer than your standard road food."}
