{"text":"It's about time that Kensington finally got a good, quick and delicious Indian restaurant.  I eat here frequently and am constantly impressed by the variety, quality and value of this restaurant.  

The combos are great, and the small is more than enough food.  Their vegtables curries are delicous and different.  Green beans with cardamon and Sweet Potatoe Slices coated in Mint Chutney are amongst my favourites.  The butter chicken is wonderfully fragrant with a bit of a kick and the chicken is always melt in your mouth tender.  They have a tandoor oven on site - which means delicious fresh naan upon request.  

My favourite thing, however has to be their vegtable pakoras.  They are by far the best pakoras I have ever had.  Not to greasy - they are loaded with real vegtables including red and yellow peppers and spinach.  They are so tasty and come with chutney to dip.  They are 4 for $4 and great to share.  

Seating is a bit of an issue - there are some tables outside (mostly in direct sunlight), one on the front \"deck\" and a counter which you could eat at inside.  But I've heard they are planning more inside as well as possibly opening the back yard up as a patio."}
{"text":"This place has ok food. However, when they opened everything was way too expensive for lunch in Kensington. I decided to try them again later and the price went down, which made it worth while. Then the combo suddenly included less food which made is barely worth it. Then the price went up to where it used to be. Too expensive for too little food. Too bad, because the food is actually ok (when it's hot, that is). Won't be going back."}
{"text":"If it's the same Debu... 

Debu has moved to the Crown and Tiger Pub on College St. (near Bathurst)!!

We stumbled on Debu's Kitchen by accident thanks to some dear friends of ours who like cheap ($10) pitchers!!!

Debu's food was outstanding. We chose the jackfruit koftas (fried vegetable balls simmered in a creamy sauce) which we've never seen before and had to try. They were amazing. The koftas were tender and the sauce was fragrant, complex and rich and not oily or heavy. We devoured the koftas with some amazing fresh, flaky whole wheat parathas. Mmmmm! We fought over who would get the leftovers the next day! 

This could very well be the best Indian food in the GTA! We're planning a second visit very soon!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place. I really like the idea of a takeaway Indian counter-I mean really, shouldn't there be more of these? But the food is A-OK but hardly terrific. 

The butter chicken was tasty, but the palak paneer was kind of sour?
And really if you're gonna serve curry takeout perhaps it's time look into packaging that isn't Styrofoam and prone to leaking?

I have on occasion stop by during P.S Kensington and can definitely talk up their samosas-those things are good!"}
{"text":"Meh. 

I so wish that this place was good-they're Pakistani-Indian...it's so rare that Indians will happily sell Pakistani food or vice versa. 

The prices are pretty high. Indian food should not cost this much, especially for take-out indian that is mediocre at best. NO! its just...all wrong. 

On pedestrian sundays Ive seen them sell food for quite cheap, like two things for $5, which was amazing, but when you go in for over the counter Indian eats dont get your hopes up - your indian food craving will not be satisfied after this place I'm afriad. 

$3 for one samosa btw...

You know come to think of it there really should be more indian food places in Kensington...cheaper and yummier, especially..."}
{"text":"4.5, I'd say. 5 stars for price and service but honestly only a 4 for the food. It's good food, but I've had better --  albeit more expensive so it's really a very good place to get some desi delicacies.

It's a pretty new take-out combo meal style joint so there's not much written about it yet. But, I really like it so I'm gonna give it a little review on here. I've eaten there a bunch of times now and I always get the special. The special is an either small or large combo consisting of a million things! Instead of the usual \"butter chicken with naan or rice,\" for ~$7, you get basmati rice, a naan, one of those crunchy cracker garlicky bread things, your choice of two curries, lentils poured over the rice, salad with your choice of several chutneys and dressings, and a free tiny cup of kheer (rice pudding) for dessert. The small comes out to about $7.60, and the large a bit over $11. The small is more than enough me!

Great place to have a sort of mini Indian buffet on the go!"}
