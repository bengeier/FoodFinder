{"text":"Great holiday party here with a wonderful staff. However, after the party we moved to the Artizen bar, which was packed and tried to sit with a group of 11 in the seating area of the bees knees and was asked to move to a seating area for 5 in the lobby, five feet away. This place does not seem to have a commercial sense at all. I would recommend a new night manager to deal with parties and overflow situations in a polite manner."}
{"text":"The Camby treats sports fans terribly. Just wanted to hold up welcome to Phx signs as buses rolled past and told we had to leave the premises. Only 6 fans present. We live 2 blocks away and will never be back. Security guard claimed The Camby owned the entire block. Sure..."}
{"text":"Gorgeous hotel! We stayed at the Camby for my sister's bachelorette and I couldn't be happier with our decision. Not only is the decor awesome and chic, the staff is fantastic! Jessica at the front desk was super helpful checking us in and accommodating all our requests. We also booked cabanas by the pool and Trevor was an excellent host. I can't wait until my next stay at the Camby."}
{"text":"5 star service that goes above and beyond! My husband and I checked into the Camby and stayed for two nights, my son came down with some sort of flu/cold and we extended our stay for another night as to let him rest. The hotel staff could see he was not feeling well since that morning when we ate brunch with our extended family at the Artizen restaurant and everyone was so kind to cater to him and us. That evening they sent an amazing get well care package; we never could have imagined a hotel would care so much! We are so grateful and blessed by our stay, we will be recommending this resort to anyone staying in the Phoenix area!!"}
{"text":"The stay and service was great.  Over charge on either end of parking garage or valet.  However the accidental charge of 182.08 on my credit card that I noticed after a month of staying there was uncalled for.  Had I not reviewed my cc statement never would have known as I did the check it thru the phone and they said I had a zero balance.  Check your cc statement within that month erroneous billing.  When I called today they said they would credit within 5 business days.    They have this often as the guy said  I just fixed it this morning, hence I hadn't given him my full name.  So that leads me to believe I am not the only person.  Other than that THE STAYCATION was perfect."}
{"text":"Great experience! Staff was all friendly and helpful, added the extra touch always open the door and ask if you need anything."}
{"text":"So bad, its a bit comical.  This was once a proud Ritz-Carlton.  It's been reduced to a W wannabe, a mixture of new trying to be hip, and old and classic, that has been painted over and reduced to gaudy.  If the service were even passable, it would help.  But, even there, it has a painted over feel.  Too bad--best location in the city."}
{"text":"The hotel is absolutely gorgeous. Excellent wait staff all around. They went out of their way to give suggestions on what to do and where to go. One of the best parts of my entire vacation was my massage by Lawrence. He really knew about anatomy and how to work into problem areas. I can't say enough great things about my massage experience. Book in advance! 
Thanks Camby staff for an excellent ending to our vacay"}

{"text":"So unbelievably impressed with the service, cleanliness and the friendliness of all of the staff. We had 2 rooms- 2 adults & 4 kids. They treated us all like we were their ONLY customers!  I cannot say enough fantastic things about Dominque and her staff. We will ABSOLUTELY stay here any time we are in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Had the best time at this hotel this weekend!  The staff couldn't be more accommodating to our big group.  The food was outstanding, I ate outside the hotel for lunch one day and wished I had just stayed at the hotel.  Rodney at the pool bar was awesome.  Can't say enough good things about our our stay....The Camby made our trip!"}
{"text":"WOW .. what a huge disappointment. After all that time, that is best they could come up with.
The entry way is what an earlier reviewer stated ... oddly Vegas like - totally out of place.
The lobby and front desk is supposed to be what !?!?!?!? A joke to be precise.
The two restaurants in the lobby area - totally miss the mark. Weird menus and bizarre seating and lighting. Trying WAY TO HARD to be cool.
Could have been a great addition to the hotel scene in Phoenix and instead it is a place to avoid. Far better hotels to stay at - go with them."}
{"text":"My first stay since the change from the Ritz.  Décor is hip and not old school like the Ritz.  Yes, I'm almost 60 and I like quiet unassuming, yet upscale, to conduct business meetings.  The rooms were in need of an upgrade and The Camby did a good job.

A super WOW I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HOW THEY SERVE IN ROOM DINING.  Believe me, you are given a card board box, plastic utensils and salt and pepper small packets. Forgot to mention the paper napkin.  Reminded me of the days I was a soccer dad and ordered pizza from Dominos for the kids at the nearest Motel 6.  I'm actually upset enough to go to another hotel for tomorrow night.

Anyway I can post a picture of the card board box I took?"}

{"text":"I loved most everything about this place from the hip décor, great music and friendly staff. Our room was amazing! Everything was so clean and comfortable. Theo at the front desk made our stay delightful helping us with whatever we needed.

I enjoyed sitting by the outdoor fire pit in the evening. I also liked that they had an outdoor yoga class to attend for free on Sunday mornings.

There is a valet parking fee to stay here, but I thought it was worth it to be in a nice place with some great places to walk to. There are a few sweet restaurants we hit and great happy hours. The dining at the hotel was awesome!

I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"}

{"text":"The hotel is really amazing with the updates and retro vibe. They seem to be a bit under staffed at the front desk and pool bar. The issue was the obnoxious \"band\" playing in the bees knees on Friday night. A buxom blonde and a random guy doing lip sync covers of techno funk. Not the vibe this place needs. Cool jazz or ANYTHING but this nightmare!! Wow not cool"}
{"text":"I stopped by the Camby to meet up some friends for some lunch. The restaurant \"Atrizen\" was very delicious! The food is very ever due to a mix of savory and sweet items in one. The hotel itself is very stylish, it really feels like Phoenix. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone that wants style and class while being in an Upscale neighborhood"}
{"text":"I have been a long time platinum member with Marriott. I have appreciated the level and commitment to customer service. The Camby has set the bar for other Marriott properties around the country to say nothing of the Phoenix area. We were there for a week and we're always greeted with a smile and an offer to assist us in any way. The rooms are great with incredibly comfortable beds. Breakfast was high quality with exceptional service yet again. The Camby is my new \"go to\" hotel in Phoenix."}

{"text":"Just a big caveat to all that the Marriott Camby Autograph Hotel in Phoenix, AZ by the Biltmore refuses to honor late check out requests from Marriott Platinum Elite members.  This was my experience with that property on Saturday morning August 26, 2017.  Our experience at the Camby turned out really bad and I want you to know how we were treated at that property.
 
Original Request
I originally requested a late check out when I checked in with the Marriott mobile app on Friday August 25th.  At that time, I received a confirmation on the app that stated \"You are all set for a 4:00pm late check out\".
 
I also saw the same confirmation message on the Marriott app the morning of August 26th (check out day).
 
However, like many other Marriott Insiders, I have previously experienced a disconnect (sometimes) between what the Marriott app says and what is actually communicated to the hotel's front desk.  When this mis-communication happens regarding a late check out request (for some reason the front desk sometimes does't know about the late check out request coming from the Marriott app?), the front desk associate will nevertheless immediately state that a late check out is perfectly fine and they thank me for being Platinum Elite.  But this is NOT what happened at the Camby.
 
Camby Get Failing Grade
However, at the Camby, not only did the two front desk associates (Holly and Jessica) say I NEVER requested a late checkout they also said there is no way the Camby could honor it anyways.  I was stunned.  Absolutely stunned.  I even told Holly that we need more time and at least until 1:30pm due to my disabled daughter's health needs.  Again, Holly said no late check out was possible.
 
Check out Already Confirmed on App
I told Holly that the Marriott App says my late check-out is already confirmed.  Holly went on to say that I needed to take that up with Marriott because their hotel has nothing to do with the Marriott app.  Nice response, right?  I asked again and again to have the Platinum Elite benefit honored and was told no.  Period.
 
Request to speak with Manager or GM
I also asked to go up the \"food chain\" and be given an opportunity to speak with the manager or the General manager - my request was denied.  Holly did offer me two drinks in the bar for my troubles of getting kicked out 4 hours sooner than we planned.  Not being a drinker, that offer was unacceptable and nevertheless it would have done nothing for my family's major inconvenience.  The Camby really messed up our stay in Phoenix and the Camby made a good hotel stay into a completely terrible stay. 
 
I Texted Screen Shot from the Marriott App
I asked where I could text a screen shot of the Marriott app that shows my late check out request was previously granted.  Holly gave me their number that accepts text messages. I do not know who from the Camby was reading the texts - again very unprofessional to not let the customer know who they are texting with.
 
However, we got no where with Holly or Jessica (and Jessica was actually very rude to my wife).  Holly was just unpleasant on the phone like she was angry or something.  Holly also said she was going to call me back with another alternative.  Holly never called me back.
 
The Camby get an \"F\" or whatever lower score we can provide on this forum.  If you must stay there, please be aware of Jessica's and Holly's poor attitude toward customers.
 
So, after getting nowhere with a late check to, my family CHECKED OUT of the hotel.  Then, AFTER we had already left the hotel property, I received a text message that they apparently changed their mind and they could now honor my late check out request.  Really, are you kidding me?  How timely?  What is going on at that hotel?  The person reading the text messages must be a different person and he/she is not in contact with Holly or Jessica.
 
Therefore, via text message again, I replied to the above message and I asked again to speak with the GM.  A text message reply came back said I would be contacted Monday morning.  
 
However this also did not happen - I have not yet received a call from the Camby's GM (who I believe is Mr. Onal Kucuk).
 
The Marriott Camby in Phoenix is either full of incompetent associates or they intentionally lie.  And neither of these are acceptable and certainly not normal for a Marriott property.  The customer experience is seriously compromised and this is something everyone should know.
 
I have been loyal to Marriott for over 20 years because of excellent service and outstanding properties.  However, the Camby failed us.
 
I also lodged an \"incident report\" with Marriott's Platinum customer service number.
 
I will post what they do about this unfortunate situation.
 
Best to all.  Happy travels."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite hotel in the area. Easily 5 stars but totally disappointed tonight as the conference room was a sauna for our event. 100+ people and quite a few complained but all we got was, we let engineering know. No results and folks left early. Seriously disappointed.
Maybe next year we won't have our graduation here?"}
{"text":"The Camby has a very targeted market:  hip, 30-ish people.  I am neither.  However, I wanted to see this new addition to the Marriott line, given I'm a permanent Platinum and travel 100% of my work life.

It's only been open a month and it's still got some work to go.  The pool is unfinished (\"a couple more weeks\") and they have no business center (huh) - there are double doors on the ground floor whose windows are engraved \"Business Center\" but the card key readers are swipers (the Canby uses the wave type), so you really can't get in.    

Seems like THAT business center is a remnant from the hotel's Ritz Carlton days - the guy at the front desk said \"we don't have one yet - it will be over there\" and pointed to a bare corner.  I wonder if they've had/are having cash flow issues?  The elevators, too, are looking like they've had better days.

The good:  it's new, so the carpets, the bedding, etc are fresh.  Especially, they laid out some bucks for the pillows (a real point in their favor IMO) and the bed was comfortable.  There's a good sofa (but it sure doesn't look like a sleeper.)

They have generous amounts of USB ports, so I was able to charge both the phone and the iPad by my bed.

The folks at the front desk were really friendly and accommodating, although the room location they gave me really wasn't great.

The bad: I was in room 623, which is right off the elevators... I went to sleep listening to ding... ding... ding... and people's conversations and they waddled to their rooms.  

The chair at the desk is not made for the middle-aged female backside.  It's made for the skinny hipster.  The chair also doesn't height-adjust.  That's a bummer, as I'm a little low for comfort while typing.  Butt-squeeze and sore arms, negative points.  

The TV, while well sized for the room, doesn't flippin' MOVE.  It's affixed to the wall, but not on a swivel, so if you're sitting on the sofa, your view of the TV is limited at best.  Likewise if you're working at the desk.

This is environmentally unfriendly, I know, but I LIKE the little sample size shampoos etc - more accurately, my mom does, and the local homeless shelter gratefully accepts any other leftovers.  Here, the tubs of shampoo, body wash and conditioner are firmly affixed to the shower wall.  

Parking.  Seriously, $33 for valet?  It said $24 on the website.  This is the second Autograph hotel I've stayed at where they advertise the self-parking on the website then upcharge you for valet.  I'm a Platinum, really, you're gonna dunn me for that kind of money?  

No concierge.  That's a bummer.

The ugly:  I'm trying, TRYING to filter out the target market stuff but it's hard.  

The focal points in the room are twofold:  a large 2'x2' godawful plastic steer skull staring vacantly over your head as you work at the really skinny desk (slightly smaller than the span of the cranium above you).  I keep expecting steer snot to drip on my keyboard... Casper the friendly ghostcow is just creepy.

The other focal point caught me crap from my co-workers, as they also booked in here after I did.  The... uh... thing... over the bed.  In the pictures it looks like a dark mirror and they HOWLED over the idea that I chose a hotel with mirrors over the bed.

It is NOT a mirror.  It's bizarre... it's a polished brass artwork with two phrases engraved within the frame:  \"Good News... it's almost time to drink coffee again\" and \"Everything's looking up\".  Well, okay.  The problem with this giant framed thingy is it visually shrinks the room - the ceiling seems lower than it actually is.

All in all... maybe once it's had some time to finish up."}
{"text":"I just recently stayed at the Camby hotel with 8 of my girlfriends. We had an absolute blast and it was perfect for our weekend; a girl's weekender centered on spring training and reconnecting. 

As many have mentioned in reviews, this used to be the Ritz but now it's a Marriott Autograph collection. The decorations are modern, whimsical and based on the five C's of Arizona, which pretty much means nothing to me. We all liked the quirky artwork in the rooms and around the hotel. There did happen to be some celebs staying at the hotel while we were there, which added a fun element, but it wasn't what made our stay great. Really the Camby is just like a lot of other hotels, a building with a bunch of rooms. What sets a hotel apart for me is service, which was really good at the Camby.

The pool isn't big or fancy, but there's lots of space on deck to sit and connect, and there are Ping-Pong tables, which is fun. Most notably we had great pool service from our server Ali. Ali was attentive, friendly, and helpful and we just generally thought she was adorable. We spent almost an entire day at the pool and felt like we were very well taken care of, we ordered lunch and drinks, and some more drinks, and possibly a few more drinks, and it was here we met Matt, who deserves his own paragraph.

Matt, aka #CambyMatt, welcomed us with open arms and was the most memorable part of the hotel for us. He's a manager of some sort, and though I know he doesn't manage the whole hotel, to our set of peeps he pretty much did. He was a constant thread throughout our weekend; seemingly present everywhere we turned, from the bars, to the restaurants, to the pool. Charisma oozes from his every being, remembering all of our names, taking the time to get to know us, and constantly charming us with his humor. He was our most important puzzle piece of the weekend. I can't say enough good things about Matt, and would just like to say thank you to our \"joy is fitness\" host with the most. 

We ate at the restaurant, which had decent food, and to keep hammering the \"service is key\" theme, our server Miguel \"joy is music\" was on it and very friendly. We spent parts of both of our evenings at the bar the Bees Knees, which has a nice vibe and good selection of libations. Libby the bartender hooked us up with some great drinks and friendly smiles. Can you tell we like to meet people? Camby people rock... including Katerina who hooked us up with service when we were in the game room.

Only negatives: the room doors slam very loudly, which can be annoying in the middle of the night. Also the walls of the rooms are not super thick and you can definitely hear things going on in neighboring rooms."}
{"text":"Crappy service for a pricey hotel. Reserved king and was given a double. Didn't clean my room day 1...Although I was gone from 8-3 and 3:30-9. Called down and asked if they could send up a couple Tampons- 'Yes, no problem. We'll send them straight up'. 30 minutes later I gave up and left to get to a meeting."}
{"text":"Wow. What a let down. 430 per night for a junior suite and it was spartan with stained tile and an unusable bathtub (couldn't get hot water). No mini-bar and lame room service options didn't help. Twenty years of Marriott property stays and this is my first disappointment and bad review. Please take my advice- this isn't the place. Stay elsewhere."}
{"text":"OK this is my go to hotel for Phoenix, Scottsdale, Tempe and anything Arizona.  This place has been nicely and uniquely designed in a comfy yet high end way.  The people that work at this hotel are the best in the business.  Whoever does the recruiting at this hotel...  My hats off to you.  From the valet people to the front desk to the restaurant staff...  #AmazingService

The only tiny, tiny grip would be the pool.  The pool area is a little weird and the pool is very small.  Plus this hotel can get a little pricey in the seasonal times but worth it.

The restaurant and bar area has a lot of events for the public and the restaurant, from the service to the drinks, is spot on and very good.  Being a coffee snob too this place has great coffee!!!

The rooms are very comfy and cool looking and the beds are perfect!!!  The gym is super nice too...  So if you like a quick workout when traveling this place has you covered.   I have stayed at this hotel on 6 different trips and I have never left being disappointed and if anything I cannot wait to come back.

Great work Camby!!!

{"text":"I have traveled all over the US and out of the country and stayed at many 4 & 5 star hotels and resorts. The Camby was a big disappointment! The rooms where average size at best and average amenities. Nothing that screams that it is worth the price tag. This was not my issue though. If I am paying to stay at a place that is on paper and price tag a 4 or 5 star rate, I expect service at that same level. They have some real people skill training needed along with serving ALL guest with high level of respect. These issues need to be addressed before it becomes to late. Now, I will say there was a few who where excellent. Especially Wendy and Alex. Unfortunately, Kyle (receptionist) and Mijan, must have missed that class and where very disappointing. I am in the food business and \"Costumer is King\" is the motto. You should treat all customers as if they are your best customer, because, they just might be (scene from movie Pretty Woman). You just never know who you are insulting? I stayed here on recommendation of my sister (who is an employee of Marriott's which owns Camby). I would not recommend it to any of my business associates, friends, and now family. Sorry for the review, but, hopefully they can use it to improve themselves. We all need to have some constructive criticism to help us reach are best."}

The staff was on point and they were extremely accommodating. The pool is small but it's fun-- you end up talking to people and making new friends. I will definitely stay here agin-- maybe even soon. Walking distance to EVERYTHING!!! Luxurious touches with a bit of whimsy, it's just my style! Love love love!"}
{"text":"Went to their grand opening with a friend and had a lovely time.  I loved their awesome decor; the vibe was very modern with some classical twists.  

The event was held in one of the ball rooms which was really spacious. I wasn't able to try out the drinks but the food was delicious -- the salad bar included greens that were cut fresh from the plant, right in front of your eyes (it doesn't get classier than that).  

I'll definitely be back to check out the cute bar/lounge areas. I'd also love to do a mini staycation there to check out the unique rooms. 

FUN FACT: \"Camby\" is a nickname for Camelback Mountain."}
{"text":"Came out for a staycation and well the wife and I are having a great time . Now about this spot . This spot is just a trendy location and not worth the stay . No bath tub in the room , small pool and the employees are so so . We will not be back or will not recommend ."}
{"text":"Booked this hotel on Priceline. Neither Priceline nor the hotel websites stated conspicuously (if at all, because I still can't find it) that you must either spend $24 a night at the next-door AMC parking lot or 30 something dollars per night for valet (plus tip) at the hotel. Our experience was that the TV had pixelation issues that could not be resolved and that the walls are paper thin and you can clearly hear conversations in the rooms next door and in the hallways. 

With that being said, the hotel staff were very nice, polite and had a nice crib and complimentary baby care kit for our toddler. WiFi was fast and easy to access. The location is great, and the room clean. 

Overall, the cost of the hotel, unexpected additional cost of parking, and room noise, make it a hotel we probably wouldn't return to.

Dropped one star because we received a note under the door this morning stating we can't use the pool tonight because of a private event. What am I paying so much for this hotel for if I can't use all of its amenities?"}
{"text":"I've stayed here a few times and it's a trendy, quirky hotel. 

The people at the valet and front desk are always friendly. The valet stand has water and the person at the front desk offered to go out and get me some when I asked if there was a place to get water. 

The restaurant has a good happy hour, but I've never had a full meal there. They also do room service. If you don't want to eat at the hotel, there are quite a few restaurants across the street at the mall. 

The pool area is nice and the person working there made sure there were towels on the chairs and she even gave everyone ice water. You don't see that at every pool. 

My only negative was housekeeping. I felt like overall the room was clean, but I left a used washcloth in the shower my first morning and it was there when I came back at the end of the day. The next day, I tossed my towels on top of the washcloth. The towels were picked up, but the washcloth was left. Very weird."}
{"text":"Staff are excellent, but Marriott really ruined a beautiful classic hotel in mainstream Phoenix. The Ritz Carlton was a landmark and they have ruined a beautiful building.  The Camby is just not the problem. The problem is that Marriott took a classic hotel and modified it only HALF WAY. Half the hotel in modern and the rest is yet to be done.    They should have started over.  The staff are really trying to be accommodating, and they are.  But the food in the restaurant is weird and off. I dislike the front yellow sign at the entrance. It makes it look like a strip joint in Vegas. And why they had to change the front doors????? It is just NOT Phoenix. Even the bar??? They took away the beautiful bar and put a cheap Formica top. I wouldn't recommend it for anything. I have no idea what the rooms look like, so I can't tell you."}

Its located within walking distance to many restaurants, shops, malls, movie theatres and local businesses. We will be back soon.

{"text":"I met girlfriends at the Bees Knees for some cocktails on a Tuesday evening around 6:30pm and it was delightful! I LOVE the atmosphere and hip vibe of The Camby hotel as a whole. It is MUCH nicer than the previous outdated Ritz-Carlton. The Bees Knees is a cozy little bar off of the main lobby and on Tuesday evenings, they have live music! Their Mixologist is wonderful and there is an array of craft cocktails to choose from. We didn't eat, but I saw some food items pass by and they all looked heavenly! 

This is a great spot for a date night, girls night, birthday, you name it! We will absolutely be back."}

{"text":"We stayed there this weekend and were satisfied with our stay but there were certain things that made me not be too pleased with the hotel. 

Location - Amazing. It is located in Scottsdale, great neighborhood and in walking distance to shopping and great eating. 

Hotel - Lobby was very nicely decorated and looked clean. The pool area was also decent. The pool itself is small, but the area is very nice lots of space to sit and relax with fire pits at several of the tables. There is also a pool bar and free towels offered for the guests. Went to the gym once, plenty of cardio and weight lifting equipment. Kept clean and offer towels. 

Room - We stayed in the suite with one king bed and a couch with pull out bed. The room itself was nice and clean with all the amenities needed. The room was decorated in an awkward manner with a huge bull face on one of the walls and weird bird painting in the bathroom. Also the air vents had dirt accumulated in them and it almost seemed like they had not been cleaned in quite some time. Along with that the body wash was almost empty and it seemed like maybe the cleaning staff does not refill it everyday. 

Staff - Very courteous. There were some mistakes that we noticed on our bill such as extra charged from the hotel restaurant/bar. We had to call it and they took care of it promptly which we appreciate a lot. The valet service is $33/night so just be mindful of that. 

Overall it was a nice hotel, and would not mind staying here again."}
{"text":"Nice boutique hotel. Modern lobby and pool. The gym is open 24 hours which is a plus!!!! Unfortunately Christine at the front desk is dry and has a horrible attitude. We checked in late on Friday night so I thought maybe she was tired but I'm checking out now...Sunday afternoon and she still has a terrible attitude problem. No customer skills or personality whatsoever."}
{"text":"I came to the Camby for a massage and Lawrence was my LMT. He gave a wonderful deep tissue with just the perfect amount of pressure. The massage was even and focused on my problem areas. The general aesthetic of the hotel is beautiful and the spa is a wonderfully intimate and restful experience. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"The staff here has gone beyond my families expectations this Father's Day weekend! Earlier today our son Kingston was not feeling well at all so I asked the front desk if they had any medicine but they unfortunately didn't for kids. At the end of the day they surprised us with this get well package put together by the staff. This is why I will only stay at Marriott hotels! Thank you for the phenomenal service team."}
{"text":"Stayed here earlier this week while in town for work. Not sure what to think of this place. The lobby is definitely awesome and modern but the room decor was just a little too weird for my taste (even though it was modern and very clean). Autograph hotels are supposed to be unique, but this was just a little TOO unique for my liking.  WiFi was fast and the rate was excellent. The parking is extremely steep at $30+ a night. Location is pretty cool located in the Biltmore area. Service was friendly as well. The hotel isn't exactly my taste but I would possibly stay here again if the rate was good enough."}

Our flight put us getting into the hotel pretty late in the evening. I checked in with the app, but was able to walk-in and pick up the room keys. The young lady at the check in was very helpful and friendly.
Parking was probably the only negative to this hotel. The valet was like $40 a night or the self park garage was like $25 overnight. We opted for the self-park garage, but had wished we had done valet. I mean the garage was like a block away and walking in the 115 degree heat from the garage to the hotel was not pleasant.
The room itself was beautiful. Loved the copper (or is it bronze) ceilings! I wasn't a big fan of the bull skull as decor, but it did fit with the theme of the room.
The mini fridge and shower were also pluses in my opinion.
We ate breakfast at the Artizen (separate review of that). Afterwards, I decided to check out the pool area. First thing in the morning, it wasn't unbearably hot outside. I brought my magazine and laid out for an hour or so. 
The pool wasn't busy at this time on a Thursday morning which may explain why I was served water 3 times during my hour or so visit. The 1st class I was certainly grateful for. I did bring a water bottle to the pool with me, but ice cold water was a step up. I had halfway finished my 1st class when the second glass came. I had to laugh because when I finished the 1st class, someone came an refilled it. I hadn't touched the 2nd glass, so that went into a mini fridge in case someone thirsty needed it later. By the time I left the pool there was maybe 4 guests. I appreciate that wanted to make sure I stayed hydrated. 
The pool area itself was well laid out. There were cabanas with misters on them. There were also games out on the patio for guests to play.
Checkout was painless. I would definitely consider staying here again in the future."}
{"text":"I recently stayed at the Camby for work while I was in the Phoenix area. I was told by my coworkers that it was a very high-end hotel and catered to a lot of professional athletes and high-end clientele. So I was a little concerned that just being an ordinary regular working folk, I might not feel as welcome or might not fit in. Well I can say that this belief was totally inaccurate. From the moment I got there until the moment I left I was treated like royalty by the staff, they really go out of their way to make you feel welcome and enjoy your stay.

The rooms were comfortable, the area is great with plenty of dining options including the hotel and the surrounding area.

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling and considering it, and I will also be staying here at some point in the future when my wife and I come out for a visit for pleasure not work."}
{"text":"I can't say enough wonderful things about The Camby and their staff. We had our wedding January 2016 and from the first moments of planning until the days after - everything was over the top. Christi and her team were amazing in helping me plan and execute the day.  The ballroom is stunning and the attention to detail the hotel has is amazing! We did not get any negative feedback on food - everything from tasting to the service of the meal were amazing. We went with Beef, Chicken and a Veggie options (since I don't eat meat). The chef put together some of my favorite foods into a wonderful vegetarian dish. We held a brunch the next morning and again - so many wonderful compliments on the food from our guests. The Camby has a dream team of people to help make your day perfect. After our wedding we booked a massage at the spa - it was the perfect ending to the most magical day of my life! You won't be disappointed if you look at The Camby to hold your special day - they by far make you feel like a celebrity on the most important day of your life!"}
{"text":"Wow this is experience was a bummer.  The location is excellent but the hotel itself is not worth the price. I'm all for trendy and quirky but this attempt misses the mark- like high schoolers decorating for the prom. The foyer to our room was paint a vibrant blue but it has become grungy - smudgy hand prints, dried drips of water and poor paint touch up make it seem dirty. When I arrived, I was struggling with two bags, the guys at the from desk watched me approach but didn't come around to help. At breakfast we waiting a loooooong time- finally asked a passing  busser for coffee. Just generally lackluster service all around.  Used to be a Ritz and in their attempt to go more contemporary, they managed to downgrade they whole value of the place. Really sad. Won't stay again there again."}
{"text":"Dissapointing property!

Room service is delivered timely, however everything comes in a \"to go\" container.

Worst, today they were at 50% occupancy and I asked for late check-out thinking as a Platinum guest that normally travels for business 85-100 nights it would be no problem. I was wrong, they wanted to charge me $25 for late check-out!

Sorry Marriott but you have this property all wrong and the front desk staff needs to be more accommodating."}
{"text":"I'm always excited when I come to Phoenix because I really love the area so when I arrived at the airport I was immensely in a great mood. Well, my mood only got better when arrived at The Camby.

What a beautiful hotel. Simple yet stunning look upon arrival. A door man greeted me the staff at the front desk was quite helpful. I arrived well ahead of normal hotel check-in times so the gentleman behind the desk took my contact info so he can call when my room is a ready. An associate took my luggage to stow away. To kill time, I visited their restaurant, The Artizan for a quick coffee. I didn't get the appearance the place was open but they were eager to serve me an iced coffee and didn't mind that I lounged around to work on my computer. A delicious iced mocha coffee was sitting in front of me within a few minutes. When I went to go pay, the lady working told me not to even worry about it and she took care of it.

When I finally got to my room (I only waited 20 minutes), I was impressed once again. It was a contemporary look that was full of color (which I've found that everything in Phoenix is earth toned). My bathroom was clean and the shower was spacious. My king size bed was comfortable. There were plenty of wall outlets and USB chargers [that actually worked!]. I had a view of the pool from my 7th floor room along with views of other pretty buildings with mountains in the background. Sleeping was no problem as I didn't hear any outside noise.

Here's what really got me. I attended a dinner reception in the pool area/rooftop on the second floor and the food was absolutely amazing. Raw oysters, prime rib, smoked salmon, an assortment of meats and cheeses, and lobster that was cut in half so all you had to do was pick out the meat. I'll also mention that the pool area was so nice and relaxing with views of buildings around you.

Places like this make me want to experience boutique hotels more than your standard Hilton/Marriott families.

I highly recommend staying at The Camby. Among everything that I've raved about, it's located in the heart of lots of shopping and restaurants, all within walking distance."}
{"text":"I am completely obsessed with this place. I had been to the restaurant and the hotel for events before, but didn't actually stay there until this past weekend and totally fell in love. The decor is everything - from the moment you walk in, through the hallways and in the rooms - it is so artistic and thoughtful. I love a place that is designed in a way that evokes a feeling. The staff is beyond friendly, especially the valet team and Eli up at the pool. They are very dog-friendly, my pups were provided with beds, bowls, toys and treats. The rooms are beautiful, I absolutely love the blue doors! So much thought went into everything here, I was truly impressed."}
{"text":"I've stayed here back when it was the Ritz and more recently since it changed over. I like the changes even if they are a bit too hipster for my 40ish self. :)

Overall, its a nice hotel. I was a bit worried when I saw some of the bad reviews but I found the place to be nice, probably not worth the cost and I do have some \"complaints\" but nothing I would consider major. My room was clean, shower is awesome, bed was comfortable and the food was pretty good. Unlike some of the other reviews, I totally expected to have to valet and the cost is in line with what you pay elsewhere. Staff is all very friendly here.

Now my \"complaints\" and I put these in quotes as they are not that really a huge deal.

- Not sure if this was just an oversight or not, but my room didn't have the expected book with information on hotel amenities and a room service menu. This led me to believe that they do not offer room service? Not a huge deal because it forced me to leave my room (I typically stay in my room and work when I travel) and actually socialize with other humans. But it would be nice to know if I have that option, where the gym is etc... 

- Apparently the do not disturb sign on the door means that its ok to knock on my door at 9AM. I opened the door and it was two men who were apparently checking which rooms were checked out of and which were not? They asked that I remove the dnd sign when I leave - which is kind of obvious. Not a huge deal as I was already awake and working but if I was sleeping and this happened I'd be quite grumpy about it. 

Overall, I like the place and will stay here again."}
{"text":"Awesome hotel with a unique vibe.  Great location with lots of places to eat and drink within a short walk. This is my go-to hotel for work travel in Camelback."}
{"text":"This Hotel is Gorgeous! I stayed in it a couple years ago when it was the Ritz and boy did The Camby do a great job at renovating it!

The decor is sooo  cool and the service was great! We had breakfast at the Atrizen it was Also perfect! 

Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"The Camby I stayed here about 7 times this year back to back weekends so needless to say I've had a well rounded experience here.

Pros:
Reasonable rates... part of the Marriott collection so you get points too!
Great location...not to far from the airport and conveniently located to lots of great restaurants
Nice clean rooms
Friendly staff that remember your name 
Yoga by the pool side on Sunday


Cons:
For those that have super keen hearing ask to be at least 3 doors down from the elevator
If you're not an early riser ask not to be by the pool side on level 3 as they do start yoga early 

Verdict:
I would definitely come back and stay anytime again love that everything is about a 10 minute Uber ride away!"}
{"text":"So fancy! I felt like someone special, checking in to The Camby. From the moment you arrive, service is extravagant and attentive. The entrance is grand, and the lobby is vibrant and hip with cool art and modern furniture everywhere.

The rooms were very spacious and comfy. LOVED that they provided a crib + cute Honest Co. sampler box with baby lotion, wipes, and diapers. Such a nice surprise, and really made traveling with baby feel more glamorous. 

The only disappointing part of the hotel was the pool - teeny tiny, definitely more for dipping than swimming. The surrounding area was pretty basic, not the luxurious spot you want to spend hours lounging. I did appreciate the self-serve spa water, though. 

Also, I'm very averse to valet parking as the only option. It's annoying and expensive. 

But overall, a posh, artsy, memorable stay!"}
{"text":"My bride and I had our wedding reception here. Best experience we have ever had. Food was fantastic and the service was excellent. The coordinators were there every step of the way and made sure everything was on schedule and perfect.   We are gold members at Marriott and this was one of our best experiences ever. We will be returning and are excited about this hotel."}
{"text":"Stayed here for 3 nights and booked under the 1 year anniversary promo where we got a $25/day credit. At check out I was informed it was for dinner only. Feel like they should say that when you book a package as I might have booked elsewhere considering we stayed over Christmas and weren't planning on eating dinner here. Otherwise the hotel is nice, it's been updated and the location is great being across the street from the Biltmore. 

Valet is probably the only reason I wouldn't return - at $33/day plus tax, it's close to $40/day to park your car which is not common for this area.

Also as a gold member with Marriott, there's no lounge here."}
{"text":"Over $500 for a one night stay, I think not. I have been overcharged on my credit card by double the amount. 

The Camby is like a hot player. You want to love it, but it's going to burn you at the end."}
{"text":"Worst service Marriott Experience 
1.  Bar staff never bused tables, 
2.  Had to ask for silverware, napkin and a glass of sparkling water
3.  Staff continually rolled eyes at patrons if they needed anything
4.  Room not cleaned until I asked at 3pm
5.  Previous patrons food still in the refrigerator day 2"}
{"text":"Loved hanging out here. They have music poolside, and Jenga if your feeling like moving some blocks. I love that game. And a hacky sack game. Movie play on a projector over the pool at 730, pool is open even if you don't have a room upstairs. Pool goes to 3.5 feet so no diving. Wade Pool side attendant was nice and helpful. There is plenty of shade and sunlight space to suit any one. :) ill be back forsure."}
{"text":"Fantastic.
Great, comfy bed.
Kitschy vibe; boutique aesthetic.
Great central location.
Front desk was great. We came in for our mini-honeymoon and they had completely champagne and chocolate covered strawberries brought up to our room. Love the attention to detail.
Definitely will be staying here again."}
{"text":"The front desk staff are rude and do nothing extra to make your stay remarkable. All requests appear to be an annoyance. The staff appears to be pretentious - they never greet you by name. Stay at the JW when coming to Phoenix.  The decor is fun and appealing to anyone who loves visual art."}
{"text":"Loved this hotel! We brought a team of volleyball players for a tournament to this hotel and it was perfect! The hotel has great style with a fun lobby to hang out in and interesting decor throughout the rooms. We learned about the 5 C's of inspiration behind the design from our bell hop and it made us appreciate it even more. The rooms were beautiful and clean with fun quirky bathrooms. It had everything we needed. The pool area was perfect with comfy chaises and chairs to lounge in with misters above. On one night they projected a movie on the wall as well as put out corn hole and a ping pong table.
The staff were always very friendly and helpful. Valet was quick and friendly.  The hotel is in a great location with a Starbucks and a Movie theatre right next door and also the Biltmore Fashion Plaza is across the street. Its an easy walk with an underground tunnel so you don't have to wait for lights to change. There are some great restaurants and bars there. I highly recommend Wink and Blanco Tacos. Yummy drinks and delicious food.
We will definitely choose this hotel when we come back to the area. I would give it 5 stars however their housekeeping needs to be a little more efficient. We had a few rooms that didn't get their rooms clean until very late in the day or not at all. The hotel was very apologetic and made it better the next day....but that shouldn't happen at all."}
{"text":"The location is across from the Biltmore mall. Great spot to stay

The hotel needs a face lift. No jacuzzi.  Small bathrooms with tiny tubs. The elevator looks like something out of a haunted mansion. Dingy and chipped paint. 

Rooms are clean with many outlets. Noise level is minimal. 

Service is slow when calling to guest services. Often transferred to the wrong person only to start all over. 

The gym is open 24 hours. Missing a stair climber that should be on all nice properties. 

The restaurant is good with excellent service. 

For the price I would look into other properties."}
{"text":"Super eclectic and fun decor, this Autograph boutique hotel is located in a nice area of Phoenix across from a shopping center with shops and hotels. 
Our room was spacious, clean and the electric theme continued. A bull head when turned on illuminated the word MOO, scenic murals and unique furnishings definitely led Camby to stand out from your standard hotel. A bar and restaurant located in the lobby was also very good. Gym was surprisingly well stocked with good workout machines and weights. They also have a spa, but I didn't go. 
Would definitely return again."}
{"text":"This place is clean, modern has great service, nice rooms and legit food/bar options inside or nearby the hotel.  This old Ritz Carlton has been gut inside and out to give customers an elegant experience at a much lower price."}
{"text":"Great service at this hotel. Every time I have gone out to pool area they bring me an ice water. No questions asked. Rooms are average size but nice."}
{"text":"This place is weird as fuck. My beautiful fiancé and I Came to a pool party looking for a nice relaxing time and there was hardly anyone here. No greeting, except to tell me that the seat I was sitting on was reserved. For who I wonder? The place was a ghost town. After realizing what few people were there... Well let's say this place isn't for the straight of heart, if you get my drift. We decided to head downstairs to give the bar a try. There was an awkward server who seated us at the bar and loitered for a little bit, until I asked where the bartender was. After giving him the \"okay, well...\", he went to hunt down the bartender, who had a personality like Lurch from the munsters. At least he can make a solid old fashioned.

This place is just awkward and weird. Avoid."}
{"text":"Super cool and fun hotel! The pool area needs a hot tub but besides that this place is awesome and has a super nice staff, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This hotel is a great, trendy spot in the Biltmore area. I love the design of the hotel & the rooms, and the bar is stellar. The service was just OK, but I was not super impressed. The location is perfect to walk to restaurants and a few bars and shopping. We stayed the night of a charity event we attended in the Esplanade and it was nice to be walking distance.

Good for youthful business travelers!"}
{"text":"I was away on business and stayed at The Camby Hotel. I was able to get away and have a spa day for myself at The Zest Spa inside The Camby Hotel. The massage was wonderful! Scott did an awesome job very professional and the manager Stephanie Garcia of The Zest Spa was wonderful as well she was so accommodating and friendly I felt like I knew her for years! What an awesome person! I felt so comfortable and relaxed that day. I will be definitely be going back there and I definitely will be getting another spa day for myself when I go. Go see Stephanie Garcia she will hook you up with whatever you need"}
{"text":"What a renovation! Bye bye ritz and hello to the Camby! A fresh and modern look on an Arizona landmark! Cannot wait for the rooftop pool scene to kick in. Enjoyed a welcoming and refreshing nightcap on opening night. Greeted by very friendly staff and a welcoming environment! Cannot wait to attend future events!"}
{"text":"The Camby Hotel In Phoenix, Arizona (Biltmore) used to be the Ritz Carlton hotel years ago. It is immaculately kept, uniquely designed an absolutely stunning in terms of aesthetics, amenities and service. My daughter had her 18th birthday here on April 1 and we experienced exceptional service from Nia and Pamela at the front desk and Gennaro poolside. Rooms are clean and well maintained. you can literally Uber or Lyft to this hotel and everything you need is in walking distance at Biltmore Fashion Park directly across the street. Shopping, restaurants and more. AMC Movie theater with new theater, comfortable lounge seating is also in immediate walking distance. in my opinion, this hotel is for lovers, couples, singles, professionals. Not necessarily for kids. The hotel is pet friendly."}
{"text":"I stay here quite a bit for business and am impressed each time.   The service is top notch, the rooms are nice, and the restaurant is great."}
{"text":"Giving this spot two stars because of one thing: the service.

Came to eat for the first time since it transitioned into the Camby from the Ritz Carlton. The ambiance was nice and the food was good, on par with what I expected of a place like this. Our server on the other hand was horrible! There were 3 tables in the whole restaurant and it took us 40 minutes to get him to take our order. Then we got our food and he hadn't even brought water.  I may come back and give it another try, but for a place that's trying to establish its spot on map, they should step it up."}
{"text":"Let me begin this review by stating up front that I am a Marriott fan as well as a Platinum member of their rewards program. I stay in Marriott's a lot. I recently spent an amazing anniversary weekend at The Camby. I did so with some concern as I had read several previous reviews that were unkind to say the least. First the history; yes, this was the former Ritz Carlton Hotel. If you have experienced staying with Ritz Carlton you will know that these hotels go to extreme lengths to ensure that your stay is of extreme quality but most importantly the same gracious experience at each facility. The Camby is a member of the Autograph Collection  of Marriott. This is a subset of exquisite boutique style hotels that all go to great lengths to ensure that your stay is of extreme quality BUT Autograph Hotels are meant to be unique and different in every way. So if you are expecting Ritz carlton this is not that place. This is a fun quirky place, amazingly different art work and theme targeted at a youngish crowd, but hey I'm in my 50's and had a blast! We did a Saturday and Sunday nights stay. Everything was great. The lounge downstairs has two great rooms, one with a super fireplace, and an adjoining room with a huge TV and lounges. Great bartenders and snacks in the lounge. Do check out the real honeycomb that they use for making the namesake drink!! 

Rooms are decorated uniquely. Very modern art. My only complaint in the room was the chair at the dresser. It is a decorative chair, not a work chair. Sitting there doing computer work would be rough. This was not a work stay for me so no worries. Very comfortable room with robes for two.

The pool on the roof of floor 2 is great. Small pool with great food and drink service. They had yoga at 1030 on Sunday morning and about 50 people were there. The Spa is on this floor as well and outside there are two great ping pong tables and lounge seating for many people. We spent the day up here both days playing ping pong and getting sun. Cool music! BTW the pool is open 24/7!!! Wish they had a hot tub

Breakfast is very reasonably priced for a hotel of this calibre. Platinum members get a certificate for 15$ per person to apply to breakfast making it essentially free. There is no Concierge Lounge here, that is the reason for this. They bring fresh homed biscuits to the table at breakfast and they are really good. All food is locally and sustainably sourced. Great preparation and service. 

Staff here are great. I cannot recommend this hotel enough! No it is not a cookie cutter Ritz Carlton, they are trying hard not to be!! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"WOW!! The Camby Hotel Stranded 2 girls in AZ, wouldn't take a Corporate Card for reservation!! We sponsored a US TaiKwonDo Champion and when her team arrived at the hotel with reservation with a corporate card , they told them \"No, we no longer accept this form of payment!!\"   NEVER AGAIN ... Marriott Hotels Owned property, Looks like the Marriott doesn't need our companies $100,000.00 year hotel budget!!"}
{"text":"Overall all this place is really nice but the lost 2 stars because 1- the undersized pool that is only 3'8\" Deep. The patio is really nice, but the pool reminds me of someone that puts an above ground \"pool\" in their front yard. 2- the tiles above the water line were really dirty and the water had some kind of oil in it. Also a guy at the front desk said they opened less than a year ago. Well the tile in the bathroom was slightly expensive, but the grout was yellowed. :- Clearly the tile was left behind from the hotel before. The grout needs bleached or replaced. 4- also the shampoo is Moss & Mint scent. Sorry moss smells terrible!"}
{"text":"I recently had a very unfortunate experience in attempting to book an event with The Camby.  I was very excited and eager to hear from the Event staff to receive a quote and tour the facility.  Unfortunately, I never had the opportunity!  I submitted an online RFP and received a response from Jennifer Warnstedt, Director of Event Productions a few days after my inquiry.  She asked for more information to provide availability and pricing which was the first and last time I received anything from her. It has been almost 3 weeks and despite my email response, follow-up call and additional email to Joanne Stevens, Event Specialist, I have not received any correspondence.  This is worse than poor service, its a lack of service, inefficient service.  I certainly hope that anyone who is looking to book this venue receives better treatment than what I have experienced.

Every potential client/event booking should receive prompt response and consideration.

{"text":"I only stayed one night and didnt get to enjoy lounges but the boutique-ey hotel is very classy meets modern. Staff was happy and polite. The pool is open 24 hours (for now at least) which is rare in the valley. Too chilly to go in but very beautiful to sit by at night. I spent a good hour in the middle of the night when I couldnt sleep out front enjoying a fire pit on a lounge chair. One very odd thing I noticed missing from such a nice hotel.....no toilet paper holder any where in the bathroom! the roll just sits on the counter. Minor, yet odd"}
{"text":"This hotel is stunning! I love the style, luxurious, modern and traditional, quirky. My daughter Noelle is renewing her vows here May '17,  she took me here for the tour and lunch. The food was amazing, all the people who work here are friendly and accommodating.  Cannot wait for the big event, it is going to be spectacular!!"}
{"text":"Great hotel. Everything is top notch and the service is impeccable. Plenty of restaurant choices within walking distance."}
{"text":"Best hotel service ever. I didn't read the other reviews because I don't need to. I travel worldwide and the service was head and shoulders above anything I've experienced. Period. Love the unique and attractive style of the decor. Highly recommended. It's rare that o would go out of my way to stay at the same hotel if I returned with my family (this was a business trip), but if I came back to Phoenix for pleasure, I would unquestioningly stay here."}
{"text":"One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at, and I've spent thousands of days on the road all over the world. Incredible combination of excellent customer service, an ideal location, terrific rooms, outstanding hotel offerings, and an overall vibe that is superb. Cannot say enough about the level of customer service, as it is consistently excellent. Rooms have everything you would need, whether you're on business, pleasure, a family, or a couple. Well laid-out, all the amenities, totally upgraded and current from its days as the Ritz. They also offer record players with great vinyl selections, an unbelievably fun item to have in your room, complete with headphones! Internal restaurant, Artizen, is really good for any meal, and their breakfast offerings are great. Their chef is extraordinary for dinner choices. Thankful that I found their secret room adjacent to the lobby, a wonderfully tucked away game room that features a pool table and giant screen TV. Brought some take out food in after a 16-hour work day and enjoyed some pool. GREAT workout room, and they offer yoga and other special events in the pool area. The valet crew is extraordinary, a great group who are so helpful and full of energy. I'll never stay anywhere else in the Phoenix area. Thankful for Nicole and McKenzie at the front desk; Jennifer, Catherine, and Susan in Artizen; and the wonderful valet crew that includes Vince, Kelly, Chris, Eddie, Theo, Brendan, Derek and Nick! This is a wonderful place, strong recommendation."}
{"text":"The room was very clean, they were friendly. Had a great stay at the Camby.  Would have liked to have a bath in our room. The beds were comfortable, loved that it had nearby places that were walking distance."}
{"text":"Was here for a week for a conference recently. Nice location but a little overpriced for amenities. Rooms are small and basic, valet is $33 a day and parking is $25. Walk across the street to save 50% on meals and drinks."}
{"text":"GOT MY BAG! happiest ever 



just like i remembered i packed all the best stuff. my clothes, my blowdryer, by makeup, and most importantly my bright crystal....YAY"}
{"text":"Terrible service!  I left an item in my room and after 6 calls to the hotel including discussions with the manager, my item was not found. Additionally, I still have not received a call from house keeping despite promises from multiple managers."}
{"text":"The interior design of the place is beautiful. However, the service was really pushy and I got food poisoning from the scallops that I ordered. I reported it to the manager and she said they would look into it and \"check everything\" and follow up with me which she never did. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Camby during the winter. 
First thoughts: the lobby & surrounding decor is BEAUTIFUL. The staff was generally nice. I quite enjoyed the elevators, which had a little compartment that included a \"personal selfie stick\" and other cute things. It gives a very contemporary, artsy vibe. I loved the room... the ceiling had a gigantic copper-esque frame/picture which has an inspirational quote printed on it (or a funny quote, etc). I think the design overall was incredible and I would stay there again for a good price. 
The only \"downside\", I guess, was the parking. There is no complimentary parking, and parking for a short day & night was on the pricey side. That was to be expected, however.
Overall, this is a lovely resort in a great area (lots of shopping!). Thank you!"}
{"text":"I travel a lot and this hotel sucks. Cosmetically appealing to the eyes, but the service from valet, to dining, to front desk has several opportunities to improve. Customer Service is not Camby's forte. I do not recommend."}
{"text":"Great experience at this hotel. Stayed for three nights, two days. The hotel is very clean, modern and trendy. The service at the front desk as well as the valet and Artizen restaurant was  impressive. The room was spacious, nicely decorated and comfortable. My only complaint of the hotel is the high price for valet. Sounds like others have complained about this as well, so hopefully the hotel reconsiders. I much prefer self parking, but if I am forced to valet it would be nice not to be forced to pay such a high cost. That being said, I enjoyed my time as this hotel and would stay again! The pool area is gorgeous and is open 24/7 which is great."}
{"text":"Incredible customer service and attention to detail. The entire staff is amazing to interact with. For somebody who is s heavy traveler It's nice to see a hotel who cares about customer experience 

Highly recommended this hotel to all 

Enjoy !!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit at The Camby when I stayed there a few nights ago.  At one time this was a Ritz and they changed it to  Marriott Autograph Hotel in late 2015.  

They are working out some kinks (as expected when you do a revamp), but the staff is super friendly, helpful, and well on their way to making this a great destination.

I had a great room with plenty of room...upgraded bathroom and bed with a great mountain view.  They have an above average workout area with updated equipment....enough cardio machines..and plenty of room.  They also have an on site restaurant that served a great breakfast and a cool lounge for some late nite cocktails.  The lounge is still working through their cocktail menu, but they should have that up and running soon.  The pool table in the side room is a very nice touch.

Would I stay here again when I'm in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area....absolutely!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! We stayed on our wedding night and they brought up creme brûlée and sparking cider (we don't drink). The breakfast in the morning was delicious and a lot heartier than expected."}
{"text":"This is an updated and remodeled hotel located near Central Phoenix, in a very nice area.  If you have plans around the city, this is a great central location just minutes from Camelback and everything else you need.

Service was first rate.  This is a remodeled hotel so while everything is very modern, the rooms are small compared to newer hotels.  But again, service and conditions were excellent.

One thing to note; this is no parking.  Valet only.  We were on points and there was never any mention of a $33 a day valet charge.  Never.  That bill was a surprise and put a blemish on an otherwise great stay."}
{"text":"Let's just call it what it is...GREAT! The Camby was relaxing and a fun place to stay. The people were amazing. If you are pompous or regular folk , the experience will be awesome . If you can't give The Camby 5 star, then it's not he Camby, it just may be you. *****"}
{"text":"Stayed here for two days on a business trip.  Would give the hotel 4 stars and the restaurant 2 stars so settling on 3.  Rooms were very clean and beds comfortable.  They are updated with neat decor.  Lots of out of town professionals to network in the bar.  Senator John McCain was having dinner while I was there.  So it must be the place to go.  Restaurant wants to be upscale.  Had appetizers while at the bar.  Hush puppies were like deep fried cake dough.  Pork belly nachos were pretty good.  Cheese platter was not worth the price.  Had breakfast with two eggs bacon and potatoes.  I make better at home."}
{"text":"The hotel and staff were absolutely wonderful! From the early checkin, wonderful drinks, ping pong tables by the pool to the easy check out. It's conveniently located next to tons of shops and restaurants. We definitely will return and highly recommend this hotel."}
{"text":"My mom and I stayed here recently. The location is good with a Starbucks in the same area as the hotel valet area. It's also across the street from the Baltimore fashion plaza, which has a lot of different shops and restaurants if you don't want to eat at the hotel. The room and hotel was very clean. The valet service was good and quick. I slept good and the shower pressure was good. (Hotels usually lack water pressure and it makes it harder to wash my thick curly hair). Staff was friendly. We will stay here again if in the area. 

*I would like to add that it is not really took service you order, but to-go from the Artizen restaurant downstairs.*

We also stayed during the summer when rates are cheaper so it was a good value for the price."}
{"text":"Okay.... so I kinda feel like I'm at the Cosmo in Vegas but I'm in Phoenix!?? Most modern, adorable, classy, dapper boutique hotel I've stayed at in this state! Service...impeccable, \"Jim\" dope... (I stayed almost an extra hour I loved it so much) House Prosecco...perfect & food was fantastic! I'm OCD on clean and they meet my expectations for sure! So glad I found this spot!! Huge thanks to Robbi, Daniel and Brandon for going above and beyond to make my stay fantastic! I don't typically remember names but these three went above and beyond! 
Thx Camby, I'll def be back!!

{"text":"This review is based on my second trip to the Camby Hotel in the Biltmore area of Phoenix, AZ.  My first trip was within 2 weeks of their opening, so I wanted to wait a little longer until some kinks were worked out and they had some time to establish a routine.

This trip was fantastic and I really have one person to thank for it.  Luke at the front desk is amazing.  He helped me both times but really went above and beyond this trip to ensure that I had what I wanted, and then some.

When you travel each week, the road becomes your home and every little detail counts in making the stay enjoyable and comfortable.  One of my biggest request on the road is to have a bathtub.  Though not all rooms have bathtubs, Luke not only made sure I had a beautiful tub, but took the time to look at my Marriott profile and see that I had Platinum status and was able to update me to a beautiful suite...much more than I had asked for.  

Can't wait to come back in June!

Pros:
Luke at the front desk for being detail oriented and more than accommodating.
Changing their towel presentation in the bathroom from hanging on the rack the first time to make it seem more welcoming (confused me as I thought the room hadn't been cleaned) to being folded so you know walking in that it's a clean room.
Lovely toiletry products provided by Nest.
Perfect location to the mall and plenty of great restaurants within walking distance.
They give platinum members the options to earn points instead of taking the breakfast at the restaurant.

Things that don't affect the stay, but are interesting:
Toiletries that you cannot take home with you since they are in large bottles.
An interesting cattle skull (to match their Arizona 4C theme throughout the hotel), but still interesting nonetheless since it projects a light on the wall that says \"moo.\"

Cons:
A front door that is not yet ADA compliant since it does not have an automatic door opener.  They have ordered the components so hopefully that will be changed sooner than later.
Front desk does not have water available for guests, not even platinum members.  Was told to have to go outside to the valet to retrieve the water.
No longer have a concierge lounge like the old Ritz Carlton did on their 11th floor."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin.  My experience here was absolutely wonderful.  Such a nice hotel in a perfect location with incredibly welcoming and helpful staff members.  The pool service was the best.  Gennaro served us both days and made our experience perfect and relaxing.  The food here was great and I highly recommend the tipsy tea party!  All around excellent experience and will stay here again."}
