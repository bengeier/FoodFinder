{"text":"Teriyaki chicken with soba noodles! That's what I get every time... It's pretty darned good for a fast food Japanese place in a mall! The food is cooked up on a big grill in front of you (with a bit of performance usually thrown in by the cooks ~ \"yummy, yummy chickeeen!\"), so depending on the rotation of the chicken, you may have to wait 10 minutes or so for the chicken (or steak, I guess) to cook up. That's fine, as it's worth the wait for fresh food. The teriyaki chicken comes with some traditional veggies ~ bok choy, I think ~ and a very light sauce. However, they do use some vegetable oil, so don't expect this to be the lightest meal you've ever eaten. Surprisingly, I found some threads on the web of people dying to reproduce the recipe, so I guess I'm not the only one who enjoys Sarku every so often!  Oh, by the way, lots of folks get double meat, but with the soba, I might go into a comatose state if I tried that one, so I just get the regular meat portion. It is PLENTY.  P.S. I've heard you can do double veggie instead of the rice normally served with the teriyaki. I might try that, but it's hard to say \"No\" to soba noodles. : ("}
{"text":"This is pretty good food right in the Food Court of West Towne Mall. If you are here shopping around and don't feel like racking your brain for where to go get your next meal, this is it!   First up, they offer samples of their teriyaki, one of their specialties. Give it a try, you can always decide if you want to place your order with them afterwards. Chances are you would, because it's freshly stir-fried and warm. Besides chicken, beef, shrimp or a combination of meat and shrimp are all on their menu, together with a couple of appetizers and vege options.   It's nice watching your food getting cooked. They make it right in front of you AFTER you order, which means everything is freshly-cooked and hot right off the pan!! It is definitely not common in food courts to say the least, which makes Sarku so wonderful.   For the healthy eaters out there, they offer a hefty serving of fresh vegetables to go with your combo, complimentary!"}
{"text":"Best Sarku in the USA! I traveled the country and this is by far the best location! Other states had low quality chicken and veggies..Get it at East Towne!"}
{"text":"Okay, all these reviews are shocking to me. This is the busiest restaurant in the mall. Always has a line. I could seriously eat chicken teriyaki with fried rice every day and never get tired of it. The employees are super friendly. They are always saying jokes and having a good time while they prepare the food in front of you. Every time I go to the mall I get lots of waves and smiles from the cooks. LOVE this place."}
{"text":"I actually crave the msg in their food every once in while.  My recent experience has caused me to rethink. There is a good reason why there is a sign up front says make sure you get your receipt or your meal is free. While the order was rung up, I was ask \"extra meat?\" answer \"no\". He then proceeded to ring up the order and failed to give me a receipt until he caught me staring at the sign. When I check the receipt, I realize that he had charged me for extra meat even though there was no instuction in their toothpick system for extra meat. When I pointed out this error, he apologized and refunded me.  But I am left feeling that there is something fishy in their business practice. I will stay away from this place from now on and take my msg craving elsewhere. CHECK your receipts!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their staff are not super talkative however that's ok. I prefer friendly service over talkative any day. Their food is always fresh and tastes wonderful. Their kids portion is the perfect size for my lunch and it comes with cabbage and a drink to include the teriyaki chicken. So tender and juicy. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, reasonable prices! Love to get the extra meat on the chicken teriyaki so we can take leftovers home.  Their Bento box is reasonable and delicious also, but their teriyaki is the absolute best!  Always fresh and almost no wait as they are cooking it as you order it."}
{"text":"it's so weird that this is in the mall, it deserves its own little spot downtown or something. the fact that the veggies and meat are cooked fresh right in front of you is what gives it 5 stars!  it's delicious and the portions are generous. for 6 bucks you can leave with a lot of food, enough for the entire day maybe. get chicken teriyaki and springroll with veggies. yum!"}
{"text":"Beware Consumer, Food poisoning! we whole family got our lunch at this place, chose chicken teriyaki with rice, no veggie, I don't think the rice has any problem, there is something wrong with chicken, it muss be, I am pretty sure, since those are only food we ate. Later afternoon, all family, no one survived, had severe vomiting, even more horrible experience, at night time, I was running the fever, along with diarrhea, vomiting, headache. The next day our whole stomachs were still sore and we all felt weak. What a terrible, horrible, no good, bad day we had! We will never ever come back to that place again!"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review from 5 years ago. I gave this place another try and I was really happy. They always have a long line and that means it's good food and a good value. My mom and dad like it too."}
{"text":"Best chicken teriyaki in Madison. friendly staffs, Good quality food at affordable price.  Come and taste if you are in West Towne mall."}
{"text":"Good fast food.. They cook in front of you. This way i know what happen to my food... I see how everything prepared.  I add double the meat.. On top of my heaping pile of rice ( i opt out on the mix veggies.. I guess they put more rice in place)  The portion in huge.. I end up eating the chicken... Not much on rice. I could have shared this...."}
{"text":"Good quality chicken teriyaki in the mall. Very affordable and huge portion"}
{"text":"Lost in the sauce. Ordered a bento box. It was not a rush lunch hour, very slow. Was not offered a drink and customer service is terrible. Just as bad as last time.  I don't know how long a bento box takes but give me a heads up. The staff was more concerned with their lunch and we're arguing about something in the back.  Finally got most of the box, they said they will bring my tempura to my table when ready.  In short, I will either go to Charley's or ruby thai kitchen."}
{"text":"Sarku Japan is CHEATING! I went to Ross Park Mall and ate in Sarku Japan for their Teriyaki chicken twice last weekend. I accidently found their cheating when you didn't ask for a receipt. I ordered one and I didn't ask for a receipt first. It was OK and my husband wanted me to order another one for him. So I went to order EXACTLY the same thing after 10 or 15 mins. The guy didn't even ask me if I need a receipt for the second time which was weird. I came home and found they charged me ~2 bucks more than the first time for my second time. I knew the 2 bucks were nothing seriously. BUT THIS CHEATING behavior was disgusting which I never had before. Please pay attention and ask for a receipt even if you want to go there!!!"}
{"text":"I used to eat here quite a lot back when I work at this mall around seven years ago and it was always good. While in the area, I decided to return when I was craving teriyaki, however it appears they've changed things slightly. I used to avoid the chicken as I felt it was too fatty and I'm not a fan of dark meat, so I would usually get steak or shrimp. Still, because they give away free samples of their chicken, I had a bite of it anyway and it's still exactly as I remember it being, tasty, but too fatty. So I went with the beef and shrimp teriyaki on white rice. The veggies are still the same, the shrimp are still the same, but I don't know what that stuff they call beef is anymore. It used to be pretty normal looking thinly sliced steak (similar to what you would get on a cheesesteak), now they pull out three \"discs\" of some gray substance and break that up. Still, I ate and it didn't taste horrible, in fact it had very little taste at all, I think they may have forgotten to season the protein, or just choose decided not to anymore. I understand trying to save a few bucks for cheaper meat, but seasoning isn't very expensive and should be incorporated into their food costs when pricing the items to accommodate the cost. In short they need to step up their game a little and from was I've experienced, it doesn't seem that difficult of a task for them."}
{"text":"Was walking out the door to the mall and on a whim swung by. Ordered teriyaki beef with extra meat and noodles. They forgot my order and 20 minutes later and 5 patrons behind me got their orders fast. They then apologize and gave me extra beef to apologize and then got he order wrong. While waiting the cashier was discussing the pleasures of a 3 some with his best friends wife and \"back door\" access. Not the best experience."}
{"text":"I think the food in general here is quite decent, and the sushi is better than many places. Their non-sushi menu is very fairly priced and the food is good."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place whenever I visit the mall.  It always has a line but you will find it worth the wait. Food is good and staffs are friendly. And it's interesting to watch them prepare your food."}
{"text":"Sarku has always been one of my all time favorite places to eat especially in the mall. I always get their Chicken Teriyaki on white rice with double meat. Yum. They always have a person passing out samples when you walk by if you haven't ever tried it before. Sometimes the cooks will even give a little show while they are cooking the meat. They also offer free iced water cups if you don't want to get a soft drink. I'll get it on occasion if I know I'm not extremely hungry."}
{"text":"I don't know why no one has reviewed this place yet.  I personally think the food is not too bad but you can not understand a word of anything anyone working there is trying to say.  I'm sorry.  I am not trying to be rude or disrespectful.  I am being totally honest.  And what really gets me is that what they try to say is no where near what they are trying to say.  The woman had to actually pick up a packet of sugar and show it to the guy behind me so he could understand what she was trying to say.  It's baffling."}
{"text":"This little place is great for a quick lunch or dinner. The staff is friendly and will accommodate if you just ask. It is a cheap eat for the chicken teriyaki which is only  $4.89. You can substitute your rice for extra veggies if you do not care for rice,all you  have to do is ask."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Sarku! I work in the mall and I eat here everytime on break. Most of the time I just order white rice by itself which is probably the cheapest meal in the mall for $1.60. (And they'll put teriyaki sauce on it if you want!). They are very friendly and personable. Sarku's Teriyaki Chicken is one of the best. Not to mention their sushi which is extremely cheap compared to buying it at frys or anywhere else. I give them 5 stars! :)"}
{"text":"This place used to be called Sakkio Japan and went through another name change for a short time I believe? But the people there have stayed the same for as long as I can remember (probably elementary school, so 10 years or so). And it's the same delicious chicken teriyaki.  Fast food chicken teriyaki, as a very specific style/dish, holds a very elevated place in my book, mainly because I learned to love it from this place. This is the best mall teriyaki I've ever had in the country, and I've tried a lot of places in a lot of malls/airports/train stations, etc. It's my go-to meal before traveling or mid-shopping.   The sauce is perfect, whereas most have an overwhelming molasses smell and taste. It's the perfect saltiness to complement white rice or noodles, though fried rice is okay too. The chicken is always perfectly tenderly cooked, uniform pieces. And a huge portion for $6. I don't like their vegetables (too crunchy/bitter, and a small portion for an extra charge, and they're extra charge, so I wouldn't bother getting them.  I guess they don't need my vouching for them, really, because the constant sample giving bring a huge line whenever there are people at the mall. A great place that has stayed great through the years. One of my permanent favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"The food here is good they are one of the last rew restaurants located in the fiesta mall food court. They recently dropped their prices because the mall is closing. They cook the food quick right in front of you. If this location closes I hope they reopen at a new location and please let customers know."}
{"text":"I have to agree with what previous reviewers have written, the food is sub-par especially considering the price. I have yet to try the sushi there but I have had the cali rolls which came with the box, they were precisely what I had expected.  This place is alright, when you need a large pile of food and you're at everitt and you also need to run through the rain and you'd like to limit your distance to about one street crossing, sarku is right up your alley!"}
{"text":"If I could give s negative rating I would.disgusting.they served rotten black carrots and the cabbage smelled and tasted sour. When I returned it they argued with me and have me back $2 of my $7 dollars. Terrible customer service and serving food that will make you sick."}
{"text":"They are out of business!  My son and I really loved this place, and we were both disappointed to find that it was empty.  They are putting (yuk) Chipotle in its place."}
{"text":"Look, this isn't going to be for everyone. I get that, but Sarku Japan has been a not-so-guilty pleasure of mine since my days working at an AT&T retailer at Belden Village mall. Today, Danielle had to return some things to a couple stores at the mall so I went along and got lunch in the dining court. I've tried the chicken teriyaki but my favorite is the beef teriyaki w/ shrimp and a little sriracha sauce. I wish i lived closer to a Sarku location because it's one of my favorite lunch meals and it's very filling (beef, shrimp, rice and veggies w/ teriyaki sauce). for only about $8 it can't really be beat."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great place to eat at. I highly recommend anyone to try it. I love their beef and noodles with extra sauce"}
{"text":"Solid chicken teriyaki. For the record their \"daily special\" is ALWAYS chicken teriyaki (lol?), or at least every time I've been there (at least 10-20 times). There's always a food sample which is nice since I can satisfy a little sarku craving even without buying a whole chicken teriyaki meal.  Double meat chicken teriyaki is basically what I get every time. I have deviated on occasion and tried shrimp teriyaki, but that was slightly bland and definitely not as good. The fact that the chefs make everything fresh adds to the experience for sure.  Also it's about as far from authentic japanese as one can get. I don't know why some people think they're getting japanese food from here. The only thing remotely japanese about the entire chicken teriyaki meal is the sauce, which I bet isn't even that genuine. Teriyaki is never actually made with chicken either. It's classic tasty quick mall food that's more American than Japanese, deal with it."}
{"text":"I wish this place was a drive through instead of in a mall.  I only do take out on my way to work. And the \"10 minute food take out\" spots a full half the time with people who do not have regard for the sign.  Getting take out at Sarku usually take 7-10 minutes if they don't have any ready when you have walk up to order. But this stuff is like crack"}
{"text":"Pretty good for fast food as far as mall food standards go. I like that the meal is cooked fresh and right in front of you so you know what's going into it. I'm a huge fan of the chicken and shrimp meal with fried rice and veggies. I typically opt out of the extra sauce since the food is already pretty salty, but it definitely hits the spot when you want something fast, cheap, and easy."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom. Yummy teriyaki and big portions. One of the few places to get nearly-fresh 'fast' food."}
{"text":"Probably the best food you can get at the mall. You can get a large portion of chicken Teriyaki with vegetables in an affordable price.  You order your food, and wait until they cook it. Overall, I would only eat here if you don't want to go out of your way to leave the mall. Otherwise, there are better places in Madison."}
{"text":"I really like the stuff. Normally, but today they gave me some food that they had already prepared previously. I assumed it hadn't been there for very long. I was wrong when I got to the table into the but it was cold. So I took it back and the guy was indignant about it after he stood there for several minutes he asked me if you wanted him to make a new one. I said no give me my money back because I'm not going to put up with that. Go give somebody else your business there's two other Oriental restaurant pretty much the same thing. I told them I would never buy that stuff again I suggest you do the same thing go to someone that would appreciate your  business. That's a negative one star by the way."}
{"text":"Do not eat here! Found hair in food and the manager did not care. Will be filing complaint with health department"}
{"text":"Wow, what an atrocious experience that was.  I ordered the beef teriyaki with noodles, no veg, to go.  Should be simple, right?  I got a beef teriyaki with white rice, extra veg, to eat in.  I watched the man at the counter yell at his line cooks, then take a box over the counter and flip the plate into it, just like that.  He called my order and I was standing right there as he was frantically trying to shove it in the bag.  When I told him I'd like to see it, and asked him politely to please leave it out of the bag, he held up the styrofoam carton and said, \"Look good?\"   Not only did it not look good, but once they'd fixed the order and I walked back to my office, the food was purely inedible.  The beef was fried to within an inch of it's life, tough and full of gristle, but the flavor was unlike any teriyaki I've ever had.  The noodles tasted like three day old grease.  The vegetables, which I had seen while waiting, were limp and washed out, and the dipping sauce was horrendous.  I've had a lot of really great experiences with Japanese cuisine, but this is like the McDonald's of Japanese fast food.  A terrible experience that no one should have to repeat."}
{"text":"So happily surprised they have a Sarku here! I love this mall food place! It's fast and delicious. I wish they spoke clearer English tho. I found it rather rude that they just yell out your order to you in a demanding tone and then shuffling you thru the line like cattle to the slaughterhouse, rather than offering up more hospitality. We are giving you our hard earned money here after all..."}
{"text":"Sushi fishy and awful. Ordered bento box- half the things that were on the sign either didn't come with it ( like salad or they added things like sauce all over what was supposed to be a plane California roll). Veggies were old and sitting- all was bad. Teriyaki tasted horrible.  The service was rude. I understand this is a hard work area - Mall- but I seriously want to ask for my money back- but I'm afraid of the lady!"}
{"text":"The best Sanku Japan in pittsburgh! Their foods are fresh and yummy, and the people work there are very nice! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious they cook the meat and veggies in front of you fresh. Mix your meat with rice or noodles and veggies topped with teriyaki sauce and you get deliciousness! Definitely try!"}
{"text":"I too don't understand the low ratings for this place. As others have said you've got to keep your expectations in perspective when visiting a mall food court. For a quick and tasty fast food experience I really love Sarku Japan. They do cook the food fresh to order and I usually order their Teriyaki chicken special. Their teriyaki isn't too sweet which I like and it carmelizes on the chicken for a really great flavor. Because I'm a big guy who likes to eat I get the double meat, spring roll and drink combo. All this for just over $10. In my book and palate I think this is a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"Love the chicken terriaki! Ask for extra sauce at the end!! The people always recognize me, super nice place!!"}
{"text":"Oh, my God. I have no idea if the other reviews are from friends of the owners or if people in this town have no idea what good asian food is. We came in from Chicago and looked on Yelp for a Japanese place (we really were looking for a hibachi restaurant, but none came up.) We believed the great reviews.  IT'S IN A MALL FOR A REASON!! It's terrible mall food-court food at it's worst. Granted, we didn't get the teriyaki chicken that other reviewers were raving about, but we DID get the teriyaki shrimp. Meh to the fifth degree.  We got it to go, so they dumped a ton of incredibly bland, tasteless fried rice in a styrofoam container. Ontop of that, they dumped the \"grilled vegetables.\" People, this was 95% cabbage - almost all filler. There were two small sprigs of dry brocolli, which was something, I guess. Then came the shrimp. Oy. They were already cooked BABY shrimp, that the \"cook\" put on the grill to warm up, dumping a ladle of the tasteless teriyaki sauce on it. It's a good thing I asked for some soy sauce, because that plus a bunch of hot sauce I put on it was the only thing that gave any taste whatsoever.  Oh, and the \"maki roll\" is a stale spring roll. Not good at all.  Honestly, people. In what world can this be considered good, much less very good or great?!  The workers WERE nice, although they were hispanic, which also should've tipped us off..."}
{"text":"It's mall food-court food so there isn't much to say here, but regardless I am a big fan of Sarku Japan!   Every time I'm in Fashion Square this is where I'll grab a bite to eat. Compared to other fast-food style teriyaki places I really enjoy Sarku. They give you a generous portion all for around $6 after tax, the chicken is never over or undercooked, the service is nice and competent, and most important-- the food tastes good! Try the fried rice or noodles instead of the traditional white rice- it makes for a good substitution to any meal!"}
{"text":"This used to be on of my favorite places to eat at the mall. I haven't eaten here for a while thought, and, some time in the past couple of years they decided to use lower quality chicken and I can no longer recommend it. Even when the drop the chicken on the grill, you can see just a meaty mass full of skin and connective tissue instead of chunks of chicken. When the chicken is cooked, you end up with tiny pieces of meat, grilled skin, and sometimes larger pieces consisting of smaller pieces of meat connected with skin - very unpleasant to eat. They also stopped offering chicken samples like they used to do (I believe there are simply wouldn't stay on a stick because of meat quality or it would be a tiny pieces). I also just sampled the chicken from Kato's Cajun (the place next to Sarku), and it's way better than Sarku's chicken. There is also Mandarin Express next to Sarku, and though I haven't sampled the chicken there, the chunks look big. I suggest you to try those places instead , and that's what I will do!   Advice to Sarku management: up your meat quality if you want to retain customers. Reintroduce samples if you want to bring back old customers like me and introduce new ones to Sarku. Don't compromise your standards!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites when I go to the mall. I take advantage of the Teriyaki Chicken special for $4.89 and add for $.30 more cents the noodles. The food, price and location is great though the service could use some help. More friendly approach then abrupt. Never any smiles and rarely any thank you's. I think once they get this down the business will be 5 star all around from everyone because the food is great!"}
{"text":"Really, Maria?  Reviewing a mall food court stall?  Well, yes. Ross Park Mall and I go way back to the mid-90s, before it had all the high-falutin stores and the likes of Cheesecake Factory.  The humble Sarku Japan was the original hawker of samples out front.  Every time, I would take a piece of teriyaki chicken, and my smart stepmom would usually go ahead and order her food from there, but I was the a-hole who took the chicken and ran for the Chinese food a few spots down.  But I digress.  Sarku is solid.  They mostly just do teriyaki meats over rice with a  steamed veggie side, and they do it well.  It's fast, it's inexpensive, it's tasty, and it's filling.  I can't vouch for the authenticity of the preparation, but stacked up against the fried foods and pizzas that are typical of mall food courts, I'm willing to wage that it's one of the healthier options too because the meat isn't deep-fried before being covered in sauce.  Anyway, great place to grab lunch or dinner when you need some shopping fuel."}
{"text":"Love this place! We get food here when we are shopping or even as a takeout, shrimp teriyaki with mushrooms is my go to, my husband loves the chicken teriyaki. Surprised by the negativity in the reviews, this place always has a line, especially weekends, they are typically the busiest out of the other food court areas. Staff is awesome there, the guys are always sweet and friendly and always offer extra sauce :) yum!"}
{"text":"I love their food here. If I'm ever out shopping and need to grab a bite, this is the only place I really go to. Portion sizes are huge! Sharing is really the way to tackle a meal. My friends and I split a chicken teriyaki with double meat and still don't finish it all.   Chicken is always cooked fresh, the sauce has great flavor, and the staff are friendly. Their is a slight language barrier but oh well. They know how to make their meals delicious so I'm not complaining. Never anything wrong with an order (and there have been about 100).   Give it a try sometime! You'll love it."}
{"text":"The employees here are always so polite. Maybe they're just playing the part but they're always really overtalkative silly old japanese men.   As a retarded American, I fall for this every time and am overwhelmed by an adorable experience.  Plus they have Mr Pibb, so I'm a happy camper whenever I pass by."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken tempura combo meal ($5.69) without the sauce (I wanted to taste the quality of the food, not some sweet sauce). The food was cooked fresh once I ordered it. You have your choice of white, brown or fried rice or noodles, I went with fried rice. The chicken was fresh tasting with just the right amount of tempura batter (not greasy like some places). They also freshly grilled some veggies (cabbage, carrots, peas) and then loaded up a dish with the fried rice, veggies and tempura chicken. Lots of food and the employees were super friendly.  I have had chicken tempura prepared by Japanese friends over the years and this compared well to the home made version. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years, usually taking the food home.  Long ago the price was lower and they would give you coupons -- oh well.  I am diabetic and they will give me the Chicken Teriyaki with no rice and extra vegetables (no extra sauce obviously) at the normal price.  I think that this was the place that got me hooked on Sriracha sauce."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite place to get food in the food court at the West Towne Mall. The food is perfect and amazing. You will not regret choosing Sarku. You might see someone giving out samples, make sure you give it a try, you will love it. Their is commonly a long line, which sucks but what are you going to do about it. And im not going to lie, its sometimes hard to understand the employees, but they do a good job. But when i have only a few bucks on me i cant grab sarku, since it will run you around $7-9 for a meal."}
{"text":"Better than average food court Japanese food. Rice bowls and teryaki chicken is the mainstay. Decent prices, but expensive add ons (extra meat, fried rice, etc)..."}
{"text":"Closed... This location is closed as of 7/31. I don't know if they are planning to remodel or reopen. It breaks my heart because I really liked the place."}
{"text":"Yes, it's Arizona, and no, I did not have high expectations for finding good Japanese food.  Nonetheless, I didn't think that the best tasting Japanese food I would have would be at a food court in the mall.    I was lured by the chicken teriyaki samples, and decided that they were better than I had expected.  They give good portions, and I was happy to have leftovers to take with me on my plane ride back to the Bay."}
{"text":"Food is cooked fresh upon order. Staff is extremely friendly, and the Teriyaki chicken is some of the best I've had in Phoenix. I would steer clear of the chow mein as it tastes more like flavorless lo mein, but the fried rice and veggies are always good. Mahi Rolls are also delish!"}
{"text":"Always made fresh. Husband loves this place. I prefer mango chicken but this place is really good."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in a mall. I'm from the East Coast and have been in AZ now two years. I was looking for this place here in AZ and found it at the Fiesta Mall in Mesa AZ. The food is really good, fresh vegetables and sauces. You can choose from Brown Rice or White Rice. All cooked on an open grill. Very fast to prepare and light not heavy food. Lastly the price is right under 8 bucks!"}
{"text":"Sarku is definately my favorite go to mall food...I always have other choices but nope...always Sarku"}
{"text":"the first two reviewers below (thomas & kevin) don't get it. this place DOES belong in a mall, and the point is that it IS a lot like McD's with sushi. malls all over are the US are packed with Sarku Japans, and according to their web site \"Sarku Japan are [...] the largest and most successful Japanese Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) franchise in the US\". see, they even have an acronym for this sort of stuff.  onto the food... decent, but not great (what'd ya expect?!). i feel the one in the mall has a little better chicken... this one on wright was fattier every time i've eaten there. the sushi is ok (again, adjusting expectations), the tempura is ok, the miso soup is great on a cold day (but that's harder to screw up). the one big disappointment in the bento boxes are the steamed veggies, they are consistently watery, soft, and tasteless.  on the plus side, this location has a lot more variety than any of its mall-cousins. on the other plus side, if you get the chicken teriyaki, you get served in ~1min and you could be out in another 10min.  [february update -- 1.5 months later. is it just me, or has the quality of their chicken gotten worse, more fat, less bird? the last time i was in, you could literally see the smoke, and i left smelling like teriyaki, down to my socks. the place really needs a better ventilator.]"}
{"text":"Bangin.   Great portions, delicious food, made fresh to order.   I would highly recommend going with the double meat for only a dollar something more per order. The chicken teriyaki is my favorite but the shrimp is also amazing. They also let you do both. Best food option in the food court by far."}
{"text":"Their prices seem to go up everytime I go. Inflation. Ah well. I do love their teriyaki chicken, esp. with a side of chow mein and veggies. It's my favorite \"fast food\" and it certainly tastes too good to call it that. I always leave full and happy."}
{"text":"I am personally not a huge of food court options but my boyfriend was in the mood for this while we were shopping. It was cooked fresh for us. Meal came with rice, meat and veggies for around $5.50. We upgraded to the fried rice which added about a buck more. They didn't slack on the chicken and the fried rice was good. It was enough for us to share. The employees were nice and kept up the conversation with my chatty boyfriend."}
{"text":"Love this teriyaki chicken. I basically eat here every time I am at the mall.....  BUT!!! vegetable does not equal cabbage!!  I had to review today because they give ONE piece of damn cabbage! ONE!  It is cabbage for goodness sake, it is one of the cheapest vegetables!  If I would get more \"vegetables,\" this place would be a 4, maybe.  Customer service could be friendlier too!"}
{"text":"This place belongs in a shopping center.  It pretends to be Japanese, but I ordered a Bento Box and was asked what kind of salad dressing I wanted, French, Thousand, Italian or ginger.  Yuck.  The \"protein\" is then set on top of rice or noodles.  The noodles were uninspired, like thick spaghetti with teriyaki sauce.  I paid $8.09 for a chicken Bento box which came with 4 pieces of bland sushi.  This is ok for folks who normally eat at McDonalds and want to be daring, but if you already enjoy Asian food, you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food - I had the chicken teriyaki and the \"maki\", which is just a spring roll. They give you a very very filling portion of rice, veggies, and chicken.  Price - Good price for what you get  Service - This is in the food court of the West Town Mall, service = over the counter  Pros - portion, taste, and just pure deliciousness when you top it off with some of the Chinese hot sauce they offer at the counter  Cons - Almost none, only bad thing is that it is pretty greasy  Overall - Recommended if you're wanting some good white/fried rice and chicken teriyaki to fill you up for most of the day"}
{"text":"Typical Japanese mall food. It's always in the top choices when in a mall, versus fast food. It's nothing grand, but it sure does fill you up and it is cheap. I always get white rice with chicken teriyaki and shrimp, oh, and double the meat."}
{"text":"Tried the deluxe bento and it was the worse food I have ever eaten.  The food had so much oil I was gonna have a heart attack.  ThE 4 sushi rolls they give you are soggy and old.  The side salsa well You can tell when lettuce is old and it was.  The shrimp tempura was disgusting.   My friend had the beef teriyaki and again the oil.  The salad was old and the fried rice was nothing more than a poor excuse of low level soy sauce and rice.   I would never eat here and would never recommend it to anybody. Please help pass down the word."}
{"text":"While at Fiesta Mall with my son who was getting his hair cut we decided to eat. We wondered around the food court and was approached by an employee of Sarku Japan offering free samples of their teriaki chicken. After trying it my son just had to order from there.  The staff was friendly and the price was reasonable.  He ordered the teriaki chicken & shrimp. The amount of food that he got was way more than expected and he was happy it tasted like what it was suppose to.  A definate place we'll visit in again and highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"They filled it up all the way with rice and gave a TINY bit of teriyaki chicken... And when I asked them if they could add a little bit more of the chicken, they said they can't put more teriyaki chicken because the box is already filled (with rice)!!! The picture looks totally different. False advertising at its best."}
{"text":"Hands down the best teriyaki place around! I drive here from QC just to have some. The staff is always super friendly and the food is always fresh and hot. Even my parents who were visiting from California were blown away at how good this place was. If you want some good teriyaki, check out this place!!"}
{"text":"Nice service. I got the tempora chicken, which tasted OKAY, but it was very dry and there was way more batter than chicken. It was an underwhelming experience."}
{"text":"Cheap and unexciting. Won't blow you away but its worth the ~7$."}
{"text":"teriyaki chicken w/ veggies and rice:  i have to say this is one of my favorite places to go for teriyaki chicken. i don't like the chicken drowned in sauce like most places. i like it nicely marinated and grilled like this place. the price is right and the portions are nice."}
{"text":"I am amazed by all of the bad reviews. My family loves this place. They get the chicken teriyaki with vegetables and add hot sauce. If they are shopping or walking around the mall, they will typically stop by and get some. My mom will even just stop by the mall to get takeaway. They love this place. I usually get Panda Express when we are out. However, over the Christmas holiday, I tried my dad's out and thought it was quite good. It was actually better than my Panda Express (they were having an off day). His only complaint is that they usually given too much rice. He'd prefer more vegetables. I like that you can see them cook up the food. My dad says the best chef is an older gentleman. On this given day, he said the chicken was a bit tougher. Who knows...I might try them out next time we are mall shopping."}
{"text":"Kind of a terrible,mix of people. Asked for chicken, noodles, and double meat. Got rice and double meat. No veggies. When asked they said sorry, took the chicken out of the rice and proceeded to add noodles and veggies leaving a good portion of chicken in the rice box threw threw out without adding some to make up. I've gone here a few times and the service was 3 Stars at best. During their slow hours. Will not go back or tell people. Taking my meal home instead of enjoying at the mall while shopping."}
{"text":"For a food court selection, Sarku has the overall best value for a meal.   Chicken Teriyaki, with fried rice or white rice and steamed veggies in a togo container that's filled to the rim.  All for under $7!   Yum Yum!"}
{"text":"My sister got Chinese from the place across the way and it was gross. Cold and old. I paid 6 dollars for their teriyaki special and there was no comparison. Mounded with noodles, vegatables and amazing chicken. I will make it a point to get this next time I go to the mall. AMAZING"}
{"text":"It is kind of incongruous that inside the beautiful and snooty Snotsdale Fashion Square mall, air conditioned with fancy designer label stores, that you would have this type of food court options ( the same you find in most any mall in a major city.) Like Sarku.   Sarku is a Japanese-flavored Shopping Mall Food Court Chain that is a Panda Express Wannabe. Except nobody Japanese works at this one. Only Chinese and Mexicans. Well, could be a Vietnamese and a Salvadorean.   Besides the rice bowl teriyaki stuff that Americans, particularly in Phoenix, love, they actually make sushi! Not great sushi, Mall Food Court Sushi. But if you order a #1 sushi plate (maki rolls and salmon sashimi) , the Chinese guy will tell the Mexican guy to go make it, while the Chinese guy takes your money.   Before you order the sushi, be sure you get a free taste test sample of the Chicken Teriyaki on a little toothpick. That should take care of that sweet tooth of yours, since teriyaki sauce, especially here, is just soy sauce with a lot of sugar.    Keep your expectations low, like below Safeway sushi level, and you will be alright here.    I don't know about averaging 4 stars like these other Yelp reviewers, but at least you can justify it with the price."}
{"text":"Very tasty. Friendly staff. Chicken teriyaki was amazing.  Decent portions and the price wasn't bad.  They always have free samples too.  All and all, best mall food around."}
{"text":"sick...and not in the way my college roommate use to say \"that's sick! \" (meaning cool, awesome, sweet, wicked (variation of any of the previous). No this was just gross.   After driving across town to two different malls to find a particular dress in my size, I worked up quite the appetite. Hey it's Friday- I'll go for some Americanized Asian...so I ordered the general Tso's with a maki roll ( not sushi- this is what they call their spring rolls), and noodles.  My noodles were cold...like really cold. The portion was beyond stingy- normally with these kind of take-out restaurants I cannot finish my meal, but their were exactly 11 pieces of chicken 7 of which were teeny-tiny bits... The texture of both meat and noodles was very mushy and overall not so tasty. When I paid with debit the girl at the counter literally handed my receipt and said \"sign-this\" ...so much for service. I will say it was cheap and the spring roll was edible.   I should have known better than to give into mall food cravings...not worth the calories. But hey on a positive note I did find my dress size at CP Mall!"}
{"text":"This is the place I eat at when I go to the mall food court. Their food is straight forward and I usually end up ordering the same thing-teriyaki shrimp and chicken with steamed rice and veggies. It's flavorful and hits the spot. I feel like they are a one hit wonder."}
{"text":"Yea, this is Mall food. So What?! Don't Hate, Hater.   It was 97 out and I wanted some good old fashioned, Styrofoam housed food. I chose Sarku Japan, because they gave me a sample of their chicken. It was delicious.   I ordered something off menu: beef and chicken. I regret it. I really wanted the shrimp and chicken.   I also ordered fried rice, but there was a slight language barrier at the counter and I ended up with white rice. I thought he asked me if I wanted mushrooms, and I said no. I don't know what I said no to...  Oh well, there's always another time to figure that out!  Add a large drink and I was out of there with 9$ of deliciously simple japanese-like fare!"}
{"text":"I'd eat here everyday if possible. The food is great and the staff are funny and courteous."}
{"text":"This place seems to be in malls all over the place--little wonder, the food is great!  I got the teriyaki chicken with rice and extra meat.  Cooked right in front of me and piled onto a styrofoam clamshell, it was just the right thing--filling me up nice for the evening.  Sarku is one of the better mall chains.  Get a burger next time--go here now."}
{"text":"I feel like all Sarku's taste the same, chicken is good and overall everything is pretty unsalty. However, one of my broccoli's had black stuff on it, and I'm pretty sure it was dirty, not charred.  Hm... well it WAS $5.65 after tax for a huge plate."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm  Cheap mall teppanyaki  For 6 bucks and twice the quality of the panda express of the next door I'm happy  Get the chicken though, the beef is a disappointment  Also fried rice!"}
{"text":"$4.89 for teriyaki chicken, veggies, and white rice...what a bargain!!! Esp at a Mall Food Court in Scottsdale!  PORTION: Enough for 2 people to share! PRICE: Hello, that's almost FREE!!!!  But, why so cheap? I don't like sauce on my food....so you can imagine that you REALLY taste the food better without being drowned in sauce...  The chicken tasted like STRAIGHT fat trimmed off the chicken and then stir-fried.    I prefer dark meat over chicken breast, but if I wanted SOLID grilled ANIMAL FAT, then I would had opted for a FIVE GUYS BURGER...a few counters over."}
{"text":"This gaijin is a fan. This is far from the best Japanese dining experience you will ever have, however, it meets every single expectation I had, and exceeds more than a few.  First, the price is right about on par. You can get a Bento box with a salad, rice, tempura, a few pieces, a drink, and \"protein\" for less than $10. They do rolls a la carte for very reasonable prices; I do not recall any being over $10, even their Dragon Rolls or equivalent. For those prices, nobody expects to be blown away. This glutton upsized his by adding an Unagi roll (of the same quality that you would expect form Schnucks in Urbana, but fresher). Nothing was outstanding, but it was a very serviceable meal. The roll was well-wrapped, the salad was fresh, and the tempura hit the sweet spot of both crunchy-crisp and tender-juicy.  The service was pretty fast for how busy the place was. I could deal without having order numbers shouted, but that seemed to be the only way to get the word out above the din of chattering diners.  This place stacks up well against other Asian chains, but is definitely not as good as Sushi Kame for a Bento lunch. It is a good change of pace for lunch, but do not frequent this place thinking that you are getting good Japanese."}
{"text":"Great fast food! I've had several of the different dishes all very tasty and generous portions at a good price! I recommend that you check it out the next time your in the East Towne Mall."}
{"text":"Not bad for a quick lunch....the teriyaki chicken meal is something you can't beat.  It's fresh and somewhat healthy.  The vegetables are my favorite.  And I definitely recommend fried rice over white rice.  They give you a lot of food,  could have shared it with my husband because we both did not finish.  So definitely worth the money!"}
{"text":"never again.  ordered the delux bento and wasn't a thing that i liked or finished.  won't be back."}
{"text":"Over the last few years I've collected memories at this place and Sarku has one of the worst crews I have ever seen. The main guy at the register has worked there for years is completely unprofessional. He's always on his phone, speaking too softly for you to hear him, if you ask a question he gets short with you. Last time I was there he was arguing on cell phone with someone."}
{"text":"Better than average for mall court food.  My daughter had the chicken teriyaki with noodles and veggies and it was great.  I had the teriyaki beef with white rice and it came with mushrooms and veggies.  It was OK but the meat was super thin and reminded me of processed meat and wasn't near as good as the chicken.  The rice needed more sauce so I had to go back and ask for extra sauce and it was much better.  I did get annoyed because when they initially served my food the guy preparing it said \"sauce\" ( which my daughter had to interpret for me after he repeated it 3 times since  I could not understand what the heck he said).  It would be nice if he could learn enough English to say.  \"Would you like sauce?\" in the form of a complete sentence.  I recommend trying the chicken and skip the beef.  Just saying.................................."}
{"text":"Healthy, Tasty, Fast, Cheap, what's not to love.  Awesome for mall food for sure!"}
{"text":"Yes, I've written pretty much the same reviews at the different locations... I love love love Sarku's teriyaki chicken. I think is the best teriyaki... Anywhere including in Japan lol ???????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Yes, I've said it enough lol I'm the one who buys 3 of them to go, extra meat, take them home (over an hour away lol) then enjoy it for a couple of days!!! ?????????"}
{"text":"I have never seen this place without a line.  The always have the longest line---that should tell you it's the place to grab a meal at the mall.   I always get the teriyaki chicken with fried rice.  Portions are huge.  Made fresh right in front of you.  You can customize it if you chose."}
{"text":"For the price and the amount of food you get, Sarku Japan has some solid teriyaki chicken and shrimp combination with mouthwatering teriyaki sauce! This is probably one of the best mall food options available and the food will fill you up. If you're feeling extra hungry, ask for double meat for a few bucks more to get even more chicken or shrimp.   My suggestion would be to try out just the teriyaki chicken or do a combination of chicken and shrimp. Keep in mind, the portion for shrimp tends to be on the low end, so you can basically count the number of shrimp in your food container. It does come only in a styrofoam take out container (which is not the most eco-friendly).   It usually doesn't take as long if there's a line and they're grilling food for others, otherwise it takes a bit longer if you're the first order of the day. For what it's worth, I'd say it's worth getting once in a while especially if you're hungry before or after shopping at West Towne Mall."}
{"text":"Probably the best teriyaki chicken you'll find in Madison for the price it's at. Compared to the other two options for Asian food at the West Towne mall you'll get the best bang for buck from Sarku.  I wouldn't recommend any of their other menu items though, and for some reason I always confuse \"Chicken and Shrimp Tempura\" for Chicken teryaki and shrimp tempura - which it is not. It's chicken nuggets and 2 small pieces of shrimp. Not recommended."}
{"text":"This branch of Sarku Japan is located in the food court of Ross Park Mall on the upper level near Macy's.  If you're having a Beef or Chicken Teriyaki craving, then you're at the right place. Nothing too fancy, simply rice topped with vegetables and either beef, chicken, or shrimp, grilled in a teriyaki sauce. They offer a few sides like shrimp or chicken tempura, or salad. It took me only a couple of visits and I tried everything from their menu but the food never disappointed me. Yes, it's plain simple, but I can't resist the freshly grilled Beef Teriyaki!"}
{"text":"Ate there a week ago. Food was great. Came back a week later, tried to order food.... they ran out? No sushi so they weren't going to make any more.... stopped at the mall the next day so the wife could shop, guess what.... yep out of food AT LUNCH TIME.  I watched a dozen people step out of line and go to the Chinese food place right next door because they weren't out ofanything..... not sure how you run a business without inventory."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and we love grabbing a quick bite here  My son is so picky and he will definitely eat here!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best chicken teriyaki in the Phoenix area.  I know it's a chain, and yes, it is in a mall, but trust me when I say their chicken is delicious.  I wish they had one closer because I am in North Phoenix, but I have made the drive many times to get it.  They also will offer samples so you can try it before you buy it.  One bite and you will be hooked.  I recommend the double meat because it's only a dollar more.  The vegetables are good too and they have brown rice.  I have checked the nutrition information and it's actually pretty healthy.  Also, make sure you ask for the hot sauce if you like it spicy.  As good as a it gets."}

{"text":"Once, when I was a kid, I was reading a book at recess because I was a big nerd and that's how I rolled.    This kid in my school, his name was Weston, came up behind me and, without warning, kicked me in the crotch as hard as he could.  It was the kind of kick where I didn't see it coming.  His foot caught me right in the jewel-box and lifted me a good six inches off the ground.  I felt everything go weak in my body.  I crumpled to the ground clutching my boys and screaming.  I cried like a little baby.  You would have, too.    Weston ran off--I didn't find out he was the one who did it until days later.  When the playground teacher walked over to find out what was wrong with me, I couldn't even talk to tell her what had happened.  I thew up from the pain.    When I could finally function again, I discovered my book had scattered a few feet out in front of me and landed in a puddle.  It was ruined.  And I had brought that book from home.  For weeks, nay MONTHS, after that, the other boys in my class thought it was so funny that I got nut-rocked like I did, that they spent most of their free moments trying to find ways to replicate it.  When I walked through the halls, I had to constantly look over my shoulder, lest I find a foot planted in my nards.  When I was at recess, I had to stand with my back to the wall at all times, lest someone attempt to crotch-punt me across the playground again.    It was miserable.  I had started out first grade loving school.  After that day, I never once liked school again.  Sarku Japan's chicken teriyaki is so good, that when I eat it, for a few blessed seconds, I forget the trauma of that event."}
{"text":"Got the beef with fried rice and noodles , was nothing special. Costed me 9$ which is too much for what I got, they added extras to the receipt even though I didn't get any extras."}
{"text":"While this is just a tiny chain-restaurant in the mall, I'm actually quite surprised that there isn't any reviews here.  Maybe it's that people thought it didn't deserve a review or maybe it's that everyone's been here.  Whatever the case, Sarku Japan offers great value for what you get.  As you walk up to get in line for good eats, there's almost always an employee with some chicken samples for you to try.  And you should have a sample because that will determine whether it's worth it or not for you since almost everyone gets the Chicken Teriyaki.  For roughly $5 ($7 if you get a drink) you can get some delicious Chicken with rice and vegetables and can even upgrade to double meat for $0.99 extra.  It's sizzled right in front of you, and the end result is absolutely delicious.  Their chicken egg-rolls are quite good too, so make sure to look for specials where it's included.  The only drawbacks IMO are the fact that it's in the mall and the limited menu.  They have other items besides Chicken Teriyaki, but they're generally not ready-to-go and they don't taste as good.  If you can get by these problems, then hopefully you'll enjoy Sarku as much as I do."}
{"text":"Restaurant review This is another Kato Cajun restaurant in disguise or vice versa. I forgot to mention somehow Kato Cajun uses the same carry out box... I wonder if this is owned by the same owner. Yes this is a lot busier than Kato just around the corner. Yes they have a cheaper 1 entree meal at 5.95 for chicken teriyaki. An employee was standing in front enticing you with samples. The food really taste the same, but you get less sauce and less portion here. The meal comes with white rice and for another 50 cents you can upgrade to fried rice or brown rice. You get a side of vegetables which is chopped up cabbage. It also appears that they reheat the food on the hot plate after you order so it is somewhat fresher than the other stands. To me it taste a little less salty than Kato but really has the same taste. Overall you will leave full, but you can definitely do better.  Pros: free sample, daily 5.95 chicken teriyaki meal with white rice and vegetables  Cons: bland and still salty  Hidden deals: Daily special with enough food for 2  Health code rating: C, all of these restaurants are so so in the mall. Check out the violations http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=585"}
{"text":"It's always hit or miss depending on who is cooking the chicken. The guy they usually have is lazy, it's better when he's off or on break! . The chicken and shrimp were both undercooked today and lacking teriyaki. Considering they have only a 91.5 on their last inspection that's doubly concerning.  Today it was overly greasy, and lacking any flavor. A little salt and pepper added during cookie by go a long way FYI.  Cut back on the butter and oil , it's not healthy and like I said very greasy today. The veggies were overlooked and wilty. Sad.  They need a new guy on the Chicken, this one has no pride and it shows."}
{"text":"I don't understand the super low reviews on here, eat here quite often, it's delicious, and fresh, they cook to order.  For mall Asian-style food, you can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I just wanted to make you aware that after ordering the chicken teriyaki with white rice on November 8, 2015, that my daughter came down with food poisoning. She is a healthy 16 yr old girl that ended up in the hospital and missed 3 days of school and her part time job due to this establishment. We have eaten here in the past when it was Sakkio but since it came under new ownership obviously the quality and cleanliness has gone down hill. We won't ever frequent this establishment again. The $7.95 meal ended up costing us a $300 co pay for ER and her about $120 from the work she missed. Thanks Sarku."}
{"text":"I mean, it's a sushi joint in a mall. I didn't expect much coming in so I guess I wasn't disappointed when it wasn't that good. The sushi was quite horrible. I expected that, but I was hopeful. The best deals here are the teriyaki and rice dishes. Big portions, low prices, and decent flavor. I was quite happy with this basic dish."}
