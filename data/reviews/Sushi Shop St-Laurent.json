{"text":"DO NOT EAT THE RAMEN HERE!! 
We had ramen with seafood and poke and my ramen came first and I tasted the ramen and it tasted weird. Then I smelled it and it smelled like something went bad or rotten. It was def the worst ramen I have ever had and I had to bring it back to the waitress. On the other hand the poke was ok. On my way home I had the ramen effect in my stomach and I don't think I need to explain any further. I wish I looked at the yelp reviews before I ate here."}
{"text":"So I was walking back to my hotel in 30 degree weather and I passed by this spot and saw one word- Ramen. I definitely couldn't say no to some hot miso broth. You can create your own bowl with the base which made it great for a vegetarian option.

Also everything is marked as gluten free, vegetarian etc so it went in and got a roll as well! The Japanese pickle roll looked different and tasted amazing.

I would've given them a 4 star because they didn't have 4 of the desserts on the menu when I went (dessert sushi rolls are my goal to eat to I was pretty disappointed). But the service was so great, and the prices are so worth it that they deserve a 5 star.

Great spot, love the ambience, and come here for sure!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! The sushi tacos are bite size (I wish I had know because they're too small for the price) but we're amazingly delicious. My boyfriend doesn't like salmon but he tried my salmon tacos and actually liked them! His spicy shrimp and mango burrito was great and the teriyaki salmon sushi roll was also great! My boyfriend also ordered a small bowl of ramen and he really enjoyed that. We loved our visit and hope one day our city opens up something like this place!"}
{"text":"I had the ramen and it was really bad. The chicken was bad, and they spice the soup with sriracha rather than the traditional sesame pepper oil. SERIOUSLY? Sriracha?! It was really thin broth. The place looks pretty, but the food isn't up to par with the decoration. Maybe the sushi is better, but I don't understand why one would add ramen to the menu. Usually the meat is supposed to be fatty, but the chicken was super lean like one would get at Wegman's and very untraditional/westernized. The sushi was also either super, overly fancy, OR had one ingredient in the center but not much of an in-between. I tried ordering but the waitresses refused to come over and asked me to get up and go to the counter to pay. The place was 100% empty."}
{"text":"Strolled along the street and came upon this little store. Tried the Tuna and Salmon tacos, it was delicious.
The price is reasonable, tacos were small, good for snacks not a whole meal"}
{"text":"A bit pricy for subpar food. The tonktotsu soup was so salty my wife couldn't eat it.  And what made it super weird is that they hoard the napkins and soy sauce as if they were scarce."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I love sushi but am always scared to try new places since I like raw stuff. Anyway we went here and everything was so fresh and the taste was amazing on everything!!! I highly recommend this place for great sushi!! Also try the sushi balls they have!"}
{"text":"Meh. Nothing special. Odd thing - they hoard the spy sauce like a precious commodity. Never seen anything like it."}
{"text":"OK this review was for Sushi Shop at 800 Place Victoria, Montreal but that location did not show up on the Yelp list. Anyway I ordered the Tonkatsu Soup since it was a very cold night. The Ramen was not cooked thoroughly, so it was a little chewy. I want to like this place, but I have to be honest with my yelp friends. This place more specializes in Sushi Rolls, so maybe order those instead."}
