{"text":"Best donuts in town!  This place his been around for years because their donuts are delicious. Their pizza isn't too bad either. Take note, they don't accept credit cards,  only cash. Also they are closed on Sunday. The service is fast and the prices are fair. Give 'em a try!"}
{"text":"Maple Pecan Rolls OMG!!!  Fresh donuts any time we go there.BUT you have to get there early on the weekend for the custard filled Crullers."}
{"text":"Growing up in Eastlake, this was THE donut shop.  If you ever needed a dozen donuts for something, Biagio's was the place.  All are made there in the shop, and the smell hits you when you walk in the door.  Pizza (which is always best from a donut shop!) is large, floppy and greasing, the way it should be.  Great value and open in the wee hours for those earlier risers."}
{"text":"The doughnuts are great look for the ones with cream in the middle hole It's 4.50 for a 1/2 dozen"}
{"text":"There are pretty much no other options for donuts if you live anywhere in Lake County...  once you've had Biagio's you will not want another donut that isn't Biagio's!"}
{"text":"Best donuts in Cleveland if not the whole country. When I am back in Cleveland I always make a trip back. You've got to try the creme filled or the pecan rolls. Amazing! Nothing like this in Florida where we now live. First went to Biagios in the 1980s and they seem to have gotten even better as compared to those other donut places.  BTW, the pizza has got to be one of the best around also. Hot or cold their pizza is great; that is very rare. I still brag about Biagios when I'm \"forced\" to eat those lame franchise donuts around the rest of the country."}
{"text":"I grew up eating these doughnuts - Chocolate Sprinkle is my favorite - and I have yet to find any that top it, not in New York, not in DC, not anywhere. I left Ohio a long time ago, but I stop here every time I'm in town to visit family. 
Why are you still reading this? GO! And pick up a dozen for me while you're there."}
{"text":"This place has awesome donuts. Way better than Dunkin or Amy Joy's. The prices are reasonable. The staff can do a little better as far as patience goes. Also make sure you have cash, because they do not accept credit or debit, which is sort of weird,  considering we're progressing into being a cashless society. Other than that, everything about this place is nice."}
{"text":"I've been getting Biagios donuts for years and they are amazing. The assortment is fantastic. The service is excellent."}
{"text":"First time I've ever been to  was about six months ago, I can honestly say these are the best donuts I've ever had, and what a terrific selection unbelievable.  I live in mentor and will pass up Dunkin' Donuts to get donuts here they are much better. Are used to go in Dunkin' Donuts later in the evening they were just about out of everything this place you go in anytime day or evening everything is full and freshly baked I don't know why I didn't find this place sooner been there several times"}
{"text":"Best donuts ever!! They are beyond amazing. The raspberry jelly are to die for! Never had anything bad from them as far as donuts.  The pizza isn't the best but the donuts make up for it."}
{"text":"Walk in to the new location, which is less than a block away, and you step into the old place. Biagio's made the service and dining area exactly like the old location, The donuts are just the right size and taste as good as they did years ago. The coffee is very very hot and flavorful, like the old fashioned way everyone served it before the day of lawsuits. The pizza is in old fashioned wax coated boxes and is topped with the just right amounts of everything.
Biagio's is neither trendy or trying to compete with the big chains. They are an honestly old fashioned donut shop, and that's just what I like."}
{"text":"My dad gets an assortment box every time one of us comes in to town to visit... donuts like they should be. Homemade, great variety, fresh, and perfect with a hot cup of coffee. They aren't cheap but for a splurge occasionally- totally worth it for real donuts."}
{"text":"okay, let's just say, biagio's is to doughnuts, what Lebron is to basketball. that is, the best!! you wont find a better treat! the only donut I ever had that actually beat biagios was prestis in little Italy way back in the day. biagios makes their donuts 3 or 4 times daily, and my own son, literally ate a whole bakers dozen in one night! dunkin donuts are awful and expensive! biagios melt in your mouth and u get abaker dozen for little $. go there, you wont regret it"}
{"text":"This place is a family favorite when we visit relatives just outside of Cleveland. Piping hot pizza on the cheap and to-die-for donuts. It may sound weird, but I almost always buy both in one visit! Mr. Biagio has owned the place forever and it's always a sweet reminder of regular visits I made there with my Grandpapa. The price is right, the food is great and it's easy to find. If you're ever in Eastlake, don't pass the place up!"}
{"text":"Best Donuts in Cleveland! 

Pizza is good too. Its better by the pie than the slice.

Great coffee!"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST donut shop I have ever been to. Their coffee is still served piping hot the best!"}
{"text":"Best donuts after Presti's. I would like to see more variety though. Never actually had their pizza. Cash only."}
{"text":"Both sets of my grandparents lived in Eastlake, so as a kid I got to eat Biagio's Pizza and donuts often.  My cousins would put about half a dozen donuts each on their plates and then hide in back bedroom to pig out without getting caught.  My uncle and I would kick open the door and reclaim the chocolate sprinkles and the creme sticks, give them wedgies, then throw them in the snow outside as penalty for trying to steal all the donuts.

We have a big family.  Donuts are serious business.

Pizza is good too.  Thin crust and loaded with olive oil.  If you don't hold it right, your cheese is sliding right off.

But let's be real here.

If you don't love Biagio's, you're a communist and should go back to Mother Russia, circa 1965."}
{"text":"This is the best donut shop hands down! They even started opening at 4 pm on Sundays!! So Awesome!! Ca$h Only! Most individuals are 90Â¢ & the price of a dozen is an absolute STEAL. Shakes too btw :)"}
{"text":"Best donuts ever! I'm from Mentor, but live near DC. Every time I visit the family, I have to get their donuts. They are so much better than dunkin donuts.( Which to me all kind of taste the same) my family has been buying Biagios since I was little, and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Hands down, BEST DONUTS EVER. I have never had a donut that was so fresh and delicious until I visited Biagio's. And not to mention the size of the donuts is incredible. They're so much bigger than anywhere else. I only wish they accepted debit cards but other than that they are AMAZING."}
{"text":"If I could give Biagio's 500 stars I would. I grew up eating this pizza, we would drive 20 minutes, like once a week to get it. I was never a doughnut person, but they are worth getting to me if i'm stopping for pizza. The pizza sauce is awesome, and the cheese is amazing! I've never eaten better pizza anywhere. . Not to mention they are cheap, super cheap, I remember a half sheet being $12. 

LOVE it!

But don't forget to bring cash, they still don't accept any cards."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love to get donuts from here! They are huge, tasty, and a lot cheaper than Dunkin Donuts!! It's our favorite local doughnut shop. They have plenty of different options but mostly a ton of different kinds of paczkis."}
{"text":"I have been going to Biagio's for 20 years, and continue to go at least once a week. They have the best donuts I have ever tasted, and all of my out of town guests agree. Anytime my friends visit from another state, the first thing they want are Biagio's do"}
{"text":"The donuts are HUGE and so heavy! Definitely worth the money, but I do wish they took credit cards. Can't speak for the pizza because there aren't enough options for me personally. Will for sure be back - with cash!"}
{"text":"When I die I want heaven to be Biagio's with the lemon donuts, chocolate sprinkles, late night pieces of warmed white pizza and a counter stool seat to enjoy it all!"}
{"text":"Oh Biagio's, how I love thee!  Growing up in Eastlake, we would always get these for \"special occasions\".   So tasty, so delicious, so bad for you.  

When I moved away to Michigan, nothing could compare.  Mind you, Tim Horton's coffee is fantastic, but the donuts are like hockey pucks.

When I moved back to Ohio, first stop was Biagio's.  I got a dozen, and I swear to the goddesses above, I ate about half of those.  

There coffee is fantastic, and the prices are cheap.

Even though they've moved to a new building, I swear, they've been using the same grease to fry the donuts since the beginning.  

Awesome, awesome donuts!"}
{"text":"Donuts Good.  Pizza BaaAAdd!!
Maybe I got a bad batch of pizza, because I hear other people say it's good.  But mine was bad.  It reminded me of when I'm broke and really want pizza, I make due with canned biscuits, ketchup and cheese slices.  Pretty bad.  
But the donuts were good.  $9 for a dozen.  A higher price for the paczis, (I believe pronounced-punch-kees-). I had to wait in a line at 5pm to get donuts.  Crazy.
I'm not willing to try the pizza again.  It was bad.  If it wasn't a fluke and that's really how their pizza always tastes, then my guess is people like the donuts so much that they imagine their bad pizza is really good."}
{"text":"Best donut I may have ever had. The apple fritter is to die for. The prices are reasonable and the selection is through the roof. 

I would go back here in a heartbeat if I didn't live 600 miles away, but it was so good that I am tempted to anyway!"}
{"text":"I don't normally DO donuts but I bought some because I had some guests over. Delicious and the staff were very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Been a staple in Eastlake my whole life. Best doughnuts in town & great pizza. Very inexpensive as well..."}
{"text":"Friendly service. 
Good pizza. 
Great pastries!!!
Convenient and a good price. 
Happy we tried this."}
{"text":"Biagios have the freshest donuts in this area and are very reasonably priced. A nice variety."}
{"text":"Great selection of hand made donuts.  Wait staff was very friendly and helpful.  A nice selection of jelly filled, which is key for me.  Maple pecan cinnamon roll was awesome too.  Cute little counter and a few tables to eat in.  Worth stopping if your around East Lake, OH."}
{"text":"Great Donuts. They are always fresh. Get a great cup of coffee sit at the counter and relax. Grab the paper talk to the girls. They're always friendly"}
{"text":"This was on the way from Erie to Columbus, and seeing how donuts are really my big weakness, I had to stop. They had a great selection, all of which looked fresh and really tempting. We tried the powdered sugar cream-filled, chocolate glazed cake, and a regular glazed. All 3 were great. I wanted to try the banana with cream cheese frosting, but that might have been 1 too many...
Hope I get the chance to come back and try it sometime though when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"WOW!!! Best Doughnuts in Cleveland.  No skimping on toppings/fillings here.... and their pizza is pretty amazing also!!"}
{"text":"OMG - new to the area and was told this was THE DONUT SHOP.  It is - I went in later in the day expecting to see a few donuts left, but there was still a reasonable selection.  My favorite so far?  Red Velvet donuts - and their crullers were killer.  Really - donuts for Sunday morning - this is a place you must go!"}
{"text":"Best donuts I have had in a long time.  A Dozen for $8.  You can pick from so many.  Will be going back."}
{"text":"Not much to say here other than these are the best donuts I've ever had! Growing up in the area, I couldn't even be dissuaded as a child when my aunt would jokingly tell me the chocolate sprinkles were ants. My favorites are the apple fritters, raspberry cream, maple and chocolate sprinkle. Can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Came in after a Captains game around 5pm to get a victory donut.  We got 4 donuts total: 2 chocolate covered cruellers,  a triple chocolate,  and a chocolate covered raised donut with sprinkles.  Everything except the sprinkle donut tasted stale.  Really stale like it was a day old.  

We just ate them in silence and mourned the loss of the greatest donut maker and place in the world."}
{"text":"Best donuts in NE Ohio. Wish they made the blueberry cake donut more. They have muffins and ice cream too. Pizza is sooooo good. They also have cold slices to go."}
{"text":"The best donuts on earth! All these trendy donut shops popping up on the west side of Cleveland have nothing on Biagios! There donuts are huge,fresh & addicting. Im pretty sure they are open 24 hrs on Saturdays and 3am-11pm the rest of the week. This place has a cult following. If you've never had there donut then you are not living life to the fullest. Cash only."}
{"text":"These donuts are what dreams are made of! I used to come here as a kid and anytime I'm having a donut craving Biagio's is where I go to satisfy it. They usually have a good selection of flavors and will occasionally have a flavor I've never tried before.

As far as service goes, well the counter girls can be anywhere from decently friendly to downright crabby but that doesn't stop me from coming. 

They also have decent pizza, the crust is unlike any pizza crust I've ever had before, doughy and fluffy with the lightest, crispest crust! I just wish they have better sauce because great sauce would take this pizza to the next level. 

Would definitely recommend! 

On a side note, being the donut lover I am, I ventured out to Jack Frost donuts on the west side since they get amazing reviews. Let's just say that if it weren't illegal to throw a half a dozen donuts out your window on the freeway, those baked goods would be on the side of route 90! IMO, Biagio's blows Jack Frost outta the water, or shall I say fryer!"}
{"text":"Donuts...YES. They have the best donuts around town. You can tell they haven't been sitting around all day. One donut is very filling but I always seem to want to sample every donut In the box. Pizza...not so much. It wasn't anything to remember. The customer service....I always feel very uncomfortable when picking my dozen. This has happened more then once. The ladies make you feel like you are inconveniencing them for the 3 minutes it takes to choose. I mean come on, I am one of those customers that remembers that it's CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Been eating donuts here for over 25 years and they are still killing it with their fresh donuts and pizza!"}
{"text":"We came here with four groups of people.donuts were and are amazing so yummy can't just eat 1!!!!however staff seems a bit on the not so happy side.i think customer service is a big thing and I appreciate being treated kindly, especially when I'm coming to your business.would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great home made donuts at good prices.
We've never tried the pizza but hear it's good."}
{"text":"Man, Biagio's just has the best donuts ever. Don't talk to me about Krispy Kreme (and those don't even SOUND good, by the way.... donuts are not supposed to be Krispy!!) or Dunkin' or Amy Joy. None of those others can even compare to the lovely donuts made fresh at Biagio's! 

Unfortunately, my family thinks it's funny to get a few dozen of these babies about once a week. And I always eat 2 of them because... well, I'm tubby and I just cannot resist them. They are the freshest, most delicious donuts you'll ever taste. 

And really, this is all coming from someone who isn't that big of a donut fan in the first place. 

Totally worth the drive across the river to BFEastlake to get your donut fix."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the \"could not care less\" attitude of the staff. First time visitor intending to try the paczki and purchase a dozen donuts to share but we were so put off by the staff that we purchased 4 of the paczki and left. Seems like their winning 1st place means they no longer need to care about serving the customer so the customers come back."}
{"text":"WOW!  This is probably the best donut shop that I have visited, in the Cleveland area.  I've driven past Biagio's many times, but not a huge donut eater, so never stopped.  I stopped on a random Wednesday afternoon, the place was bustling with customers and I couldn't believe how well stocked the window cases were at 2:30 in the afternoon!  Everything looked fresh and delicious.  Another plus, they have Paczki donuts year round, not just on Fat Tuesday!   I ordered a cinnamon bun enveloped with maple icing..... OMG, it was huge, soft, fresh and tasty and best of all it was only $.95, I couldn't believe it!  The counter-staff was super nice.  I can't WAIT to re-visit Biagio's!"}
{"text":"The best donuts in town.  I love them!  Try a slice of pizza too."}
{"text":"I have loved their donuts all my life, i'm 48!!!  that's saying something! Always a great and giving business in Eastlake. Long live Biagio!"}
{"text":"By far the best donuts in Cleveland.  If you are looking for something different try the red velvet or custard filled crueler.  Pizza also is fairly good and milk shakes are delicious."}
{"text":"Just as good today as it was 20 years ago when I lived in Willowick. Not a better, fresher tasting donut  in Cleveland or Akron. I enjoy the creme filled donuts the  best; the wife likes the maple creme sticks."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say.  I have grown up on this pizza and donuts for as one as I can remember.  Everything has always been good.  I noticed that depending on the day or who is working,  the  sauce is sometimes different but still good.  Their donuts arebth  best as well,  nothing compares."}
{"text":"This is HANDS DOWN the best donut shop I have ever been to. They were my favorite in high school, and they are still my favorite now. I had these donuts for the first time in over 4 years today and they are still the best donuts I have ever had."}
{"text":"I enjoy the pizza and doughnuts of this establishment. They have a style like nobody else. The service was really friendly and answered my questions on the flavors of the doughnuts, unlike other doughnut shops that can't answer simpler questions. I didn't get a chance to use the bathrooms so I can't comment on that."}
{"text":"These guys are my favorite doughnuts. They're fresh, never lacking in creme filling.  Many places have mediocre doughnuts that lack freshness and go skimpy on the creme filling. There's nothing better than a fresh doughnut. They practically melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"We live about 40mins away from this place and I am thankful for that, otherwise I'd be the size of a house. The donuts are amazing. So fresh. So delicious. Donut love people. Try 'em out. Go early, I'm told they sell out quickly."}
{"text":"Love the food. It's a local business and everyone's very nice. The donuts are better than anyone else's in the area and I don't even know what other local shops taste like because basgios is all we eat in my family. No other donuts."}
{"text":"Great little place! The doughnuts are great and the pizza was even better. Just wish they accepted credit cards!"}
{"text":"I used to live in the area so these remind me of my childhood since my family would get Biagio's quite often. They've moved locations slightly since then. I recently tried them after about 20 years and they are just as I remember. Really fresh donuts, generously filled. The service wasn't good, however, because the girl up front was chatting to her friend the entire time I was placing my order. I almost said something, but didn't. That wouldn't deter me from coming again or recommending them."}
{"text":"I have been going to Biago's for over 45 years they have the BEST Donuts in all of OHIO &  BEYOND also Great PIZZA what more is there to say"}
{"text":"First off, cash only...they have an ATM, there is a 2.00 fee.

This place is old school from the prices to the decor! I was a little confused about the way some things worked in here so I was asking a lot of questions. I felt a little bad for the girl because she seemed to be a little socially awkward. She was nice though and did her best. 

The prices here are CRAZY good! Pizza, 1.00 a slice! Donut, .90 per! They have other stuff as well but this is all I got. 

Pizza: I got 2 slices to eat there. She asked me if I wanted them hot or cold, which I found to be odd at an establishment. I got it hot. They came out in squares, thick and lots of dough, and very oily....BUT...the crust was amazing! Some of the best crust I've eaten if that's something you're into. 

Donuts: Holy cow....I'd give them 6 stars if possible!!!! I had 5 different ones which were all really good. They were all different in taste and texture. My fav was the apple perczki (or something like that) crazy delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here for a Biag of donuts, ended up with an entire Box. The tragedy is that most people in Cleveland have never been here, whereas I detour hours out of my way, and even sleep in my car with an alarm set for 4am, so I can wake up right when they're open and the Crulers are piping hot and gooey, and get a ton of them, and in 1 minute and 41 seconds, ruin all the efforts put in during my workouts for the last 4 weeks. How does Cleveland not know about these? OK, some do, but there should be 500 reviews. Is it because they are out of the way? Well my b***hole is out of the way but it doesn't stop people messing with it during foreplay, amirite?

What to get: Crulers
Just Crulers: Yes. I was going to keep them a secret, but that would be Cruler than anything.

But you have to try them when they're hot. Which means you have to come at 4am. Are you willing to do that for a donut? Once you try it hot you will thank me. It's not the same microwaved. It's just nottttttt. You may even agree once you try it fresh from its mother donut's womb. Come here and rob the cradle. Do the donut equivalent of Spanish Suckling Pig. You damn well motherf***ing know you want to you donut-obsessed donut sl**. Oh you like that donut do you? Oh you like it a bit too much don't you. Mmmhmm.

A-hem. Where was I.

A movie was filmed here. \"Cruler Intentions.\" If you're wondering where to put your Cruler, if it tastes this good... you can put it anywhere.

So these Crulers. Easily the best I've ever had. Always come around 4am for them (or whenever they are fresh out of the oven, sometimes a little earlier or later than that), because when these babies are hot and gooey, they will be one of the best things you ever tasted.

I come here a lot in the summers when I visit Cleveland. It's a Cruler summer, leaving me here eating donuts.

Located far in the distant East Burbs of Cleveland, who knew you'd find one of the best things in food history. Their coffee is good too, and some of their other donuts are not bad. But oh, those heavenly Crulers, hot and gooey, the greatest in the world. They taste like clouds. Bonus points for good service and not minding me sleeping in their parking lot.

And Demi Lovato loves these too (although you wouldn't know it to look at her lately). That's why she did a song about them: \"Cruler For The Summer.\"

If you didn't already get the hint... get to Biagios AT 4AM and not any other time, and try them when they're hot.

Donut go anywhere near NE Ohio without trying the Crulers when hot. Inspired the Jamaican Donut-laden Bobsled movie: Cruler Runnings."}
{"text":"I used to get a baker's dozen every weekend growing up back when they had their second store in Concord.  Now, whenever I get a chance to go back home I make an extra trip specifically to get these donuts.  Their sprinkle topped donuts are so fluffy and delicious and their cream filled donuts are amazing!  I would be overweight if I lived back home because these donuts are just so good. . .oh yeah, their white pizza (if they still sell it) is another highly recommended pick.

Now only if I could find a donut shop like Biagio's out here on the East Coast (Dunkin Donut's is just too plain tasting for me after growing on Biagio's!).  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Donuts and pizza are good. Not one of my favorite but will do. I love eclairs but I don't like their chocolate icing and they don't put much on. Glazed are good."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's great

But it will NEVER beat Spudnuts. 

They have great doughnuts here, not enough filling and not very big. The dough is kind of blan too.

That's what I'd choose spud nuts 10/10 Times.

#not sponsored by spud nuts even though I wish I was"}
{"text":"Any place that has coffee and custard filled crullers is going to have a warm spot in my heart"}
{"text":"This place has great donuts. They are loaded with frosting and they are very fresh. They are my first choice for donuts in Lake County."}
{"text":"Maple swirl donuts are killer.   Cash only.  Friendly service. You will never have a donut like these ever.  They are made on site and not shipped in from a factory."}
{"text":"donuts & pizza are to die for!!! A bit of a drive-- but well worth it!!"}
{"text":"Even with a newer building, Biagio's remains a great old school donut shop.   Biagio's has a great selection of donuts with 2 whole display cases plus 2 whole wall units.  The variety is matched by the quality; the donuts are fresh; nicely sweet and very flavorful.   

What I like the best are the creme filled varieties.  The creme donuts are excellent with smooth creme, sweet, but not overly so.  The donuts are almost over filled and come in flavors that include vanilla, chocolate, banana or strawberry creme.

Biagio's also has pizza available both individual pies and slices.  For $1 the slices are nice sized with a great crust, a robust sauce and chewy cheese.

If you are in the area, you need to check out Biagio's."}
{"text":"This place truly has the best doughnuts ever. My favorite is an apricot one, with white icing and no hole, but every doughnut I tried has been amazing. We often buy a bakers dozen and then add on two paczki (sp?) which are over stuffed doughnuts made with a denser dough... simply amazing tasting. My only complaint is no credit cards, but carrying cash is worth it for this place."}
{"text":"It's not hard to get donuts right. I thoroughly enjoy donuts of the Krispy or Dunkin variety and can't complain. However, after trying Biagio's donuts, you can really tell the difference in quality between a place like this and a chain like the aforementioned.

Their crullers are melt-in-your-mouth good. Light, fluffy, flaky, and almost creamy at the same time. They have red velvet cake donuts, which are also very good (though the icing could be better). Their donuts at least FEEL light, in that I could eat 1 or 2 more, and I don't feel like crap afterwards. The same can't be said for others I have tried.

I just wish it was closer. The only time I get to have Biagio's donuts is when my coworker brings them in. Moderation is probably a good thing though."}
{"text":"I grew up on Mr Biaggios doughnuts a
nd pizza!! To this day the Best doughnuts in town!! Always worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great donuts at an affordable price. I paid $9 cash for a dozen with one special donut included."}
{"text":"Me and my wife frequently visit here because we love their delicious, homemade donuts. For sure the best donuts around! The one thing we do not enjoy is the staff. Their attitude is completely unnecessary. The girl got my donut order wrong due to her lack of being able to pay attention to a customer. Once again the donuts are great so I wish to continue coming here but the staff is beginning to make it not worth the visit."}
{"text":"Loved these since I was a kid.  I've tried others, but nothing comes close.  It's hard to pick a favorite, so I usually pick 13 if the best!"}
{"text":"Super good. But make sure to bring cash. :) only have had their doughnuts so far. Never had their pizza. Maybe one day. But their assortment of doughnuts will not disappoint. You will like this place!! It's a local favorite around here."}
{"text":"Some of the best donuts in Cleveland! Mind you, my opinion would probably include a star being knocked off if I lived on the West Side (while the donuts are pretty damn good, I'm not sure that I would drive to the east side just for donuts). Often in the mornings, there is a line. The employees are pretty good at getting people in and out. Typically in the mornings, there are a few dudes sitting at the counter, enjoying their coffee and serving up complaints about the weather.

When I am up early (which is super rare - sorry, I am NOT a morning person), in a good mood, and feeling generous, I swing by here on my way to work and pick up some donuts. When I add coffee to that (this isn't like Starbucks with fancy coffee and jugs of coffee - you have two size cups to pick from), the employees find ways to put it into a large box for me to make it easier to carry. They also have put creamer in a cup, along with a bag of sugar packets and stir sticks, so that everyone can have their coffee personalized.

Apparently they also sell pizza, but I have yet to try that. I'm a little hesitant to eat pizza and donuts - plus while their donuts are good, how great can the pizza be? (if you work at Biagio's, please don't hate me for this opinion!! Maybe your pizza is slammin' and I'm just afraid of the great unknown).

Anyway, back to the real reason why I wrote this review - the DONUTS! I have yet to have a sub par donut here. They are always fresh tasting (and are often bringing out just finished trays while I am there), and delish. I mean, just take a peek at my ass and you can tell that I have issues saying no to a bite of a donut. The paczkis are delish (I live for the raspberry. However, I brought a dozen donuts/paczkis with me to Chicago last spring and my friends seemed to love the lemon. I'm just not usually swayed by lemon baked goods.) The vanilla cream long john (sometimes called a cream stick) is fantastic. 

Final point (and this is an important one!): they are CASH ONLY. There is an ATM if you don't carry cash on site, but I seem to recall a high fee. I rarely carry cash (but can usually dig out a couple bucks and some coins from the bottom of my purse, and if need be, under the driver's seat in my car. Note to any would-be car bandit - you might get like, $1.34 max, a tube of lipstick, and a water bottle cap)."}
{"text":"This is based solely on there donuts I never been to the shop my workplace always get donuts from here from patients family. And they are amazing like not your average donut you get from the grocery store the inside is sooooo soft and fluffy and just omg one of the best donuts I've ever had and there also soo big and you can tell that whoever make them love what there doing like  there made with love"}
{"text":"The doghnuts are awesome but with good quality, there needs to be a better way to put them in a box to go.  The girl smooshed four in a corner and all the icing came off on the box."}
{"text":"This local family-owned business has the best donuts around!!! We especially love their maple creamsticks, cinnamon rolls, and chocolate sprinkles. Their pizza is also good and inexpensive."}
{"text":"If this place was in Ohio City, charged twice as much and had indifferent hipsters working this place would be on everyones list as \"Best Of Cleveland\".  I have never been to the actual store but they guys at work bring them in often.  They open up super early so they must be up all night making these pillows of sexiness.  Im not a huge sweets eater but if they are in front of my who am I to resist?!  Ive had doughnuts from Dumaron to Yokohama and these are doughnuts with a capital \"D\".  Utterly amazing.  Yet another place on the East Side of Cleveland that is a hidden gem that I have driven by a million times, not even knowing what is inside.  With all the hip, douchy, cookie-cutter places popping up all over in the world of food and drink these days.....THIS is whats real and still good with the world."}
{"text":"Best donuts in Northeast Ohio.Pecan rolls are to die for.I live in Westlake and will make a pilgrimage or three every year and always stop for a sweet treat and a cuppa joe after a Captains game."}
{"text":"Donuts are my favorite food of all the foods. Several people told me to try Biagios... but I live in westlake and am never that far on the east side. Except for this past Saturday evening. I made sure to stop at Biagios on our trip out east and I am so happy I did. It's an old school donut shop, the prices are affordable, their selection was amazing at 6pm on a Saturday, and most importantly: the donuts were to die for. Fluffy, sweet, and so tasty. Next time I'm on the east side you bet I'll be back. A cleveland gem, for sure. No frills. Just some good old fashioned donuts!"}
{"text":"Came for the pizza and got hooked on the donuts! $1 slices (pep, sausage, shroom, cheese), the best donuts on the E Side, ice cream, and a friendly staff make this a must try!"}
{"text":"As a newcomer to the East side; I almost got slapped when I said that I had never gotten donuts from here. 

Usually I only like 1 type of donut; powdered lemon filled. I was really happy to see that they had them. But after looking into all their different choices, I ended up getting a bakers dozen. 

Among the donuts I chose, I must say that the maple cinnamon swirl was TO DIE FOR. 

I will be returning and getting more delicious treats! Plus the prices are amazing!!

Here's to getting pizza next time!"}
{"text":"Perfection!! Their donuts are just perfect every time! So fresh and such a wide variety every time.   As a child I looked forward to going here and now our children look forward to a visit."}
{"text":"A legend in northern OH. The donuts are soft and fluffy. Even have that subtle fresh bread yeasty aroma! Whether you choose the plain simple unadorned donut to the \"to-die-for\" cherry-filled (they sell out fast), and everything in between, this is arguably the best donut shop anywhere. Decades ago when my pals and I attended Eastlake North HS, Biagios was The place. What's more it's not expensive."}
{"text":"Very good donuts and family owned great service only downside is cash only but they do have an arm to get cash. My whole
Office loved their donuts!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  The perfect way to impress my coworkers on a Friday morning. Also, cheaper and tastier than big box stores!  They take cash only, but they also have an atm. Just a helpful hint!!"}
{"text":"Biagios have the BEST donuts in town, service is quick and workers are friendly. The donuts are always fresh and delicious. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Simply the best donuts money can buy! After eating here you'll never go back to 'chain' donut stores."}
{"text":"I've been going to Biagio's since I was a little girl with my grandfather. 
New location is great, donuts are as excellent as they've always been."}
{"text":"If there's a heaven on earth, I think it's here at Biagio's. The donuts are incredible. If I ever move I'll miss many things about northeast Ohio but I will probably only crave Biagio's donuts. If you mention donuts I will immediately get a \"glazed\" look in my eye and picture this little building on vine street. The only thing I will say is I don't enjoy their coffee but that isn't enough for me to take away a star. Whether you dine in or take out, enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Skip the ice cream, it's just standard soft serve, and go straight to the donuts.  They are simply the best.  Fresh, flavorful and well-filled.  There just isn't any competition nearby (oh, yeah, there are several of that national chain store up on Mentor Avenue, but they really can't compete with Biagio's)."}
{"text":"The best donuts around! Great service buy just be aware they only accept cash, no credit cards. There is an atm there is you forget."}
{"text":"Best doughnut you will ever eat. Biagios is an institution. My favorites are the pecan, cream stick, chocolate with sprinkles. Cash only!"}
{"text":"the doughnuts were good but not great. I travel all over looking for doughnuts that are better than Michaels bakery in Orrville, oh. the staff was friendly and the doughnuts were a nice size. the cinnamon rolls were tasty."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! And I'm not even a donut person.
It's so adorable, great selection, great bakery, great prices and great people! Get an extra treat and have a seat with some coffee before you go. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!!!  Biagio's makes some great donuts!!!"}
{"text":"I'm convinced this is the best donut shop on earth. If you are in the area, this place is an absolute must try. It's open late and there's always a line, but trust me when I say it's worth the wait! (It's never very long)

The donuts are always fresh and the size of your face - there's really nothing to complain about. Some of my favorites are the chocolate sprinkle and the cinnamon roll. I have to cut myself off at two but I could eat a whole dozen if nobody stopped me!

Most of the time I'm there for a donut and cup of coffee, but I have tried the pizza and would get it again."}
{"text":"I love these donuts. Why you say? Because they are always fresh and made with good ingredients. Yeah they aren't healthy I know but sometimes you gotta feed that sweet tooth. They serve a wide variety of donuts as well from red velvet to regular glazed. The place is kinda small and is always packed but the customer service is excellent. And please tip the workers they server you really fast and always have a smile."}
{"text":"Pizza and donuts...it doesn't get any better than this! I'm about to call and order a small pie for dinner and of course pick up a couple of donuts for a sweet dessert. Last time I was in the place they had their own version of a mini pepperoni roll, very tasty with the right amount of cheese and pepperoni rolled in a compact roll, just the perfect size for me."}
{"text":"This place looks like a hole in the wall dump in fact it looks like you might get asked out by a senior citizen lol but you know what it is so freaking good I've been going to the donut shop since I was maybe three years old get the orange juice don't get the red velvet doughnut and prepare to become addicted"}
{"text":"This place has the best donuts I've ever tasted. Whenever I see a box with the little boy holding a donut over his eye, I get excited and begin to salivate. I love how their new shop looks identical to the old shop on the inside. Same paneled walls, same little bar to sit at and enjoy a cup of coffee with your donut. It brings back happy memories of being a kid and choosing my donut from behind the glass. I've never had a bad or stale donut from this place. I hope it sticks around until the apocalypse, and preferably even after."}
{"text":"Best donuts in the Cleveland area. This is an old school bakery that stays true to its roots - always simple, fresh and amazing (and I've been coming here since I was a kid). Their location is conveniently off the freeway, so it's a pretty quick trip if on the northeast side. My favorites are the blackberry jelly, french cruller, vanilla and chocolate cream filled donuts. 

And don't forget the price! You get a baker's dozen for super cheap - totally worth it."}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! Yum! These donuts are a must!! My favorite is the chocolate filled cream stick."}
{"text":"This was about the only thing open at 6 in the morning when i would roam the streets of sleepy Eastlake. They were probably up since midnight making donuts. I love their pizza. It's like school pizza, but done better. Flat and greasy and very cheap. The pizza donut combo is a carb suicide, but sometimes you just gotta. Especially women around that \"hungry time\" of the month. It was my sister in law who turned me on to this treat. She's coming to town tomorrow and she's bringing some Biagio's out west to me. That's gangsta."}
{"text":"I grew up 2 houses away from BIAGIOS and have been eating the pizza & doughnuts since early 70's & it hasn't changed at all. Still the best Pizza & doughnuts in all of OHIO!! Even though they don't take debit/credit cards, there is finally an ATM for those who come cashless. The coffee is also great. Excellent prices. Never let down in all the years I've been going there!"}
{"text":"Love the donuts. I grew up getting them on the weekends. You won't be disappointed. Always a great experience there and the staff is great"}
{"text":"Great donuts... wow! We were visiting here for a basketball tournament and bought 2 dozen donuts. I carried the boxes out and they had to weigh somewhere in the region of a sandbag. They were absolutely delicious, and if I am in the area again, I will definitely come back to try some more donuts again."}
{"text":"I'm at a loss for words when trying to describe biagios. I grew up a mile from here and it's my \"go to\" place for donuts and pizza. It's a no frills donut shop that is able to keep costs low to provide a quality product. My westside friends beg me to bring them donuts whenever I visit."}
{"text":"yah dese donuts r good! I like that a lot of specialty donuts are included in the \"dozen\" unlike other places where it is always upcharge upcharge. They actually have good fake tasting ice cream."}
{"text":"As an elementary school student in the early 90's growing up in Eastlake, my mom would take me to Biagio's before school as a treat on a lucky morning.  The smell ... the chocolate sprinkle donut ... the little cup of milk ... I'll never forget it.  Although I don't indulge in donuts as much as I used to, whenever my mom and I make it up to Eastlake, we get a dozen donuts to take home to our respective husbands & families.  Great assortment of flavors & donut styles.  They also have pizza, which I've heard is really good.  But Biagio's will always be THE donut place."}
