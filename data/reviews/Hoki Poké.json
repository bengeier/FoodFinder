{"text":"Maybe poke in general is overpriced, but I find this place charges a lot for what you get. It's delicious, but I would rather spend $15 on sushi than on a large bowl that probably won't fill me up."}
{"text":"It's quite pricey, and aside from that the food is not very good. They fill the bowl up with lettuce... I've never seen lettuce in a poke bowl before. Also their fish isn't very flavourful .... overall the quality is mediocre..will not be going again."}
{"text":"My first poke experience was from Venice, California and because of that any place not close to the ocean with poke just won't cut it in terms of freshness, amount of fish and price.

With that said, the poke here was good, but $15 ws pretty steep. The size the fish was cut was very small and it was a mixture of salmon and tuna. The ratio of vegetables and rice to fish was almost 3:1.

The flavours were there but I can only see myself going there once in a blue moon. 

If you are trying poke for the first time, I would recommend this place. But if given the chance get real tuna poke from a coast city or island, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This has been my favourite poké place so far. 
We decided to try it, since it wasn't far and we were hungry. We were greeted immediately when we came in and quickly settled on a classic Hoke Poke Burrito to share. We sat at one of the two tables and waited, but not too long. It was nice to watch them making it by hand. 
There was a nice amount of tuna and salmon in the burrito, and I really appreciated the chunks of avocado, since most places charge a lot for it. There were lot of flavors and textures that blended together, so I enjoyed every bite! For half a burrito, I was quite satisfied. It was also less expensive than other places I have been too. 
My favourite part is that I didn't feel sick after, unlike a previous poke experience. Although that may have been connected to the volume of food I consumed.
I will definitely be back to try another, possibly the Crush Burrito. I am only taking off a star for the lack of seating and the price (which I notice are both trends in poke places). All in all, a 4.5/5!"}
{"text":"Day 6 of Poké week and this one got me pretty excited especially after seeing that their bowls came with purple rice.  We were given the Spicy Poké bowl which consisted of salmon.  It was actually a pretty big serving and I guess the amount of salmon was pretty descent.  I liked the little kick to it which wasn't overpowering.  

I'd go back here if I were in the area, though I wouldn't really go out of my way to eat here.  4/5."}
{"text":"$18 total, loaded up with everything I wanted.

Large poke bowl on black rice with Ahi tuna (+0.25), Salmon, and Albacore Tuna (+0.25) with Wasabi mayo, all base toppings (crap ton of stuff), added premium topping avacado (+1.50) and the crunch of onion crisps

The quality of the fish wasn't anything spectacular and wasn't all too filling either. Even after I finished the largest rice bowl I was still a bit hungry

I would recommend checking it out for the novelty but wouldn't suggest it as quality food. Nothing out of the norm of what I was used to, they have a sushi burrito too nowadays so that's worth giving a try too. Would come again depending on my cravings. Overall, it has a nice taste but the meal in itself is quite underwhelming. You can taste each of the individual ingredients and it doesn't necessarily work well together. Would definitely recommend the wasabi mayo though, adds a nice kick!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Fresh ingredients and quick service. A little hidden gem in the Rosedale/Yorkville area! Classic Bowl is recommended but I'm sure everything on the menu is great!"}
{"text":"I don't get why this place has as low of a rating as it does. This is my first time here and I had a spicy poke bowl that was a flavourful adventure from start to finish. Service was FAST, I'm talking like I ordered and only waited about 3 minutes to receive my food. The only downside is their seating arrangement, very tight and limited."}
{"text":"The poke box was probably a 4 out of 5 stars. But the service deserves 5 stars. Every time I come here, the employees are super kind and friendly. They work so hard and they always cater to you modifications in the poke box. One of my favourite poke places in toronto!"}
{"text":"Mmmm delicious! Love the variety of ingredients and the staff is super friendly. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I'm not too sure why this place has the reviews that it has. I ordered from them through UberEATS so maybe that could be the reason, but I do feel like restaurants should standardized their eat-in and takeout dishes if they're going to offer delivery. 

For a poke bowl, which is a FISH salad, I got almost no fish! They padded the bottom of my bowl with a ton of black rice, and they topped it with some spinach, cabbage, and maybe like 6 tiny pieces of salmon/tuna. I don't even think the fish tasted all that fresh...

I do like the fact that they use black rice so I'll give them credit for that but other than that, it was a pretty disappointing poke bowl for the price I paid-- around $15 after tax. I would never go back again or recommend anyone going here."}
{"text":"Delicious, affordable sushi burritos in the city, I've been looking for thee! Ok, ok I know poke isn't truly sushi but this was close enough, possibly even better too with its black rice over white. This was way better then Sushitto On The Road, for example, the always busy, always overpriced sushi burrito food truck in Toronto. I tried the salmon burrito and the salmon + tuna bowl here. Though the bowl wasn't as exciting, it was still good. But the burrito, oh boy, so, so good. I will be returning to try their others for sure!"}
{"text":"Tried the hoki poke burrito. Wrapped by seaweed and wild rice.

Hit the spot (will remember to take out garlic chips, was looking for something less fried tasting)!

I liked the portion, very filling. Will try different items :-D"}
{"text":"There's been so much hype about poke and sushi burritos these days that I decided to try it out today.  I've always been hesitant to try either because it always looked like a salad or just an uncut maki roll.  

However, I decided to try this place which is close to my work and I ordered a veggie bowl, which came with some nori, tofu, black/purple rice, edamane, sesame seeds and some other veggies and teriyaki sauce. The price was $11.95 + tax.  

What I liked about it was that the warm purple rice mixed with the cold veggies and nori was a contrast in texture and also hot/cold which felt very good in my mouth (that's what she said lol).   I really did like the taste. In addition, the service was very fast and it took less than 3 minutes to fill my order.

However, as I suspected, for the portion I received, it was quite small.  For almost $12, I expect a heaping portion or fill me up, but I would need at least two of them to fill me up.  

Verdict: Would I come back? Sure once in a while, maybe once a month or so, but definitely not something I would have on the regular.  If it was less than $10, then yes, but the extra $2 makes a huge difference."}
{"text":"I so desperately want to love Hoki Poke because I really enjoyed the previous sushi business that occupied this space, but Hoki Poke was just alright. The food tastes pretty decent, but for the very small portion and hefty price, I can't say I would come running back here often. I had the regular vegetarian lover bowl, which is a bed of black rice with marinated tofu, edemame, seaweed salad, and spring mix, all topped with rice cracker bits. The rice cracker bits definitely add a nice crunch to the meal and the tofu marinade was very flavorful, but I finished my bowl within 10 minutes and was left hungry still. The regular bowl came up to about $12, and to me it was just a little pricey for the amount of food you get. A large bowl comes up to about $15 and it doesn't look like it would be that much more filling than the regular. 

They also have sushi burritos here that I might try, but I've heard that the seaweed wrap always gets soggy if you don't consume it right away -this is in general for sushi burritos, not specific to Hoki Poke.The burrito is the same price as a regular size bowl.. maybe I'll give it a try to see if it's any more filling,

Overall, great flavour, but very small portions and pricey."}
{"text":"This was my first poke experience and I am in love! I can't really compare Hoki Poke to many other places but I'm sure they did it well. 

We went on a quiet Friday afternoon. It's a small place but it was empty at that time which was good for us. We ordered the spicy salmon and classic bowls. They were $11 each before taxes which I felt was kinda steep for the size, but it seems to be the average poke price. 

Our food was ready in a few minutes and we dug in. It was delicious! I loved the variety of ingredients and textures. The crispy tempura flakes, the crunch of the veggies, and the soft salmon and rice made this dish a great experience to enjoy. 

Overall I'd have to give a very strong 4/5 to this place. The poke tasted so good but the price and smaller portion size took away from a perfect score."}
{"text":"Came here as past of my Toronto poke week passport.  I got their spicy salmon bowl for $5.  

I l loved the black rice and the right balance of spicy mayo to salmon.  The super crispy lettuce was great for a nice crunch.   The bowl reminded me of modified Korean Bibimbap ....which I enjoy!   

This was a good portion and all the ingredients were super fresh!  It felt like a really good healthy lunch!  


The store was pretty and staff were super cheerful .   It was only a 5 min walk from Yorkville or a 3 min walk from Rosedale TTC bus station.    

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Just awful and over priced, they didn't get my order correct, so by the time I returned to work and realised it was not what I ordered, I didn't have the time or motivation go back. Just don't go and save your money and frustration. This isn't even real poke."}
{"text":"update: stopped visiting since they changed from sushi to poke, which I'm not a fan of. It's OK; overpriced.

-

Beautiful rolls, great service! Love the rice both aesthetically, texturally & BC doesn't feel like it sits like a rock in your tummy. Delicious but I was thrown off by the yam \"tempura\" - it was more of a flavored mush."}
{"text":"This is my second time here, first time was terrible but I thought I would give it another try. Again, disappointed. I've had some amazing Poke Bowls in California so I know my standards are high. But when a place wants to charge extra for soya sauce, and puts two strands of seaweed and calls it seaweed salad this is ridiculous. Paying over $10 and paying extra for soya sauce and wrong advertisement in saying seaweed salad while I couldn't even see this seaweed salad is a disappointment. Ridiculous. Will never be coming back here."}
{"text":"Quick lunch sushi fix, yes please! Love that they use a mixture of black, brown and white rice in all of their rolls."}
{"text":"Expensive for what you get. Especially when they use cheap iceberg lettuce. I was still hungry after I was done sadly.

It was average, I guess. Nothing really wowed, but also nothing to complain about food wise, aside from small portions.

I prefer Poke Guys over this place. Poke Guys is a bit cheaper with a bigger portion. 

If I'm craving poke again, I'd make the trek to Poke Guys instead even though Hoki Poki is way closer to me."}
{"text":"Kinda have to agree with the previous reviewers stating it's just not quite worth the price.

I had the Hoki Poke Burrito, which came to $13.51 after tax.  It was a good size, either to be a full sized lunch or two snacks (as they cut it in half).  Tastes good, but would have liked a bit more Tuna & Salmon.  (Sushitto tastes better.  I know it's a bit different, but it's all I could think to compare it to)

It's a small location, with 2 4-seat tables and 3 single stools at the window .  It's clean and bright.  They have a water jug and disposable cups if you don't feel like paying for a drink (also on the pricier side).

My only other comment would be on the fact that the woman who made my food had really long hair but wasn't wearing anything that would keep it out of the food (hairnet/hat/etc.).  I feel like that should happen.

No lineup at 11:40 AM, for what it's worth."}
{"text":"I love poke but here I had the worst experience. The fish was gross the rice didn't taste right and to top it off they charge you an insane amount for gross food. I would stay away from this place"}
{"text":"Good food average atmosphere and price as other Poke restaurants. However there is no bathroom for the public. I thought by law a restaurant is supposed to have a bathroom for the customers to use. 
The fact there is no place to pee or wash your hands before we ate, lost many stars. 
I've never been in a restaurant that had no bathroom to use."}
{"text":"This is a new type of trending food. But i was not that impress. I am a chef and I can tell that the salmon was around 3 days old. For the price, i can go to a sushi restaurant and get some fresh salmon and a bigger portion. I had a bowl for lunch but I was still hungry somehow right after. The platting and customer service was excellent. But food quality and pricing was not responsible. This place has has potential though."}
{"text":"I like the black rice they serve in the poke bowls. It's a little pricey for small portions. Seasoning was just ok. I'd go back to get my poke fix if I'm in the area but wouldn't go out of my way."}
