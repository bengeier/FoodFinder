{"text":"The best! I like their subs a lot. They have the best pork dumplings I've had in Calgary. The beef dumplings are up there too. Awesome soup (pho and wonton... Although I'm not usually the wonton type) 

The owners are really friendly. Service is quick for the type of restaurant they are. Quite a bit of seating for a small place, too."}
{"text":"My partner and I came in for dinner around 6 PM after seeing all of the high ratings. The first thing we noticed was the size of the restaurant - it's tiny! We spent a bit of time deciding what to order, and as we did, the place filled up. It was packed by 6:30. We ordered at the counter and paid upfront. My partner ordered the Pad Thai ($10.50) and I ordered the saté beef noodle soup ($8.95). Our food arrived quite quickly - perhaps a little bit slower than the average Vietnamese restaurant - but to be fair, the place was packed. The beef saté was wonderful. Hardly any fat and the beef was incredibly tender and flavourful. The soup base was pleasant and super spicy. I would definitely order it again. My partner said the Pad Thai was about a 4/5 for taste. The portions were somewhat smaller than usual (though the saté beef soup was completely packed with noodles and broth - I'm not entirely convinced it would be physically possible to stuff more food into that small bowl), but they were also less expensive. The service was good and the man who served us was very pleasant. We will definitely be back soon to try the subs."}
{"text":"Best Vermicelli in the Bowness/Montgomery area. I have been coming to this place for years."}
{"text":"I just had the sate beef noodle soup. It's a clear broth that looks simple but was very delicious. I added a spring roll and it came out so fresh and hot. I would definitely go back again. 

The staff was great. Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"I really hesitated giving them only three stars, but our last visit was just not good. The previous visits were okay. It seems like they are very good with a few dishes, but not with all. The Pad Thai is very tasty. The beef noodle soup is good, although the last time there was just way too much onion in there. Some rice&noodle dishes are rather \"meh\". #20 tasted like pepper and nothing else, very disappointing, and again lots of onion. #18 was okay, but nothing more. 

It's a small location, seating maybe 12 people. They offer frozen wonton soup kids to take home. A parking lot is outside."}
{"text":"When we walked in I was expecting a larger restaurant. It's quite small so it's obvious they specialize in take out seeing as most customers that walked in took their food to go. The staff was very courteous and the portions were very large for the value. Only stopping through while traveling but would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Clean, authentic, and a great mix of MSG FREE Asian Cuisine. Non-GMO tofu used in all soy dishes!

Appetizers include Samosas, Dumplings and Spring & Salad rolls. There are also soups and subs available. There are plenty of rice & noodle dishes and vegetarian options too. 

My first time here I was greeted warmly. There are only 12 seats so it's a small space. A cooler is available with frozen food as well as take-out.

I chose to have the #19 Pad Thai - Rice Noodles with chicken, prawns, vegetables (mainly onion), egg and tofu. This is stir-fried with a special house-made sauce. It was very good especially paired with a fresh squeezed lemonade and bubble tea.

This is a great place to come if your in the area. I really got the impression that the owner cares and delivers all the dishes to each table with pride!"}
{"text":"Read all the reviews so decided to stop by and try it out.  Had the chicken noodle soup, which was really good.  The grilled chicken kicked it up a notch and added a bit of texture to the soup.  One suggestion for the owner though - I had take-out and the small container of soup was barely enough for the noodles and chicken, i didn't even add in the sprouts, otherwise, there would not be enough broth to finish.  Maybe a slightly bigger container would be good, or think of a charge for an extra container of soup (maybe $3).  I also had the spring rolls which were awesome.  Will definitely go back, there were some interesting dishes I want to try, their pad thai and dumplings.  Overall, the place looked clean and very inviting.  Parking is pretty good, shared lot with other shops in the strip mall and Dairy Queen.  Good addition to Bowness."}
{"text":"Hands down the best vietnamese in the city. My boyfriend and I live just around the corner and order from here at least once a week. Everything we've had is delicious, but the grilled vermicelli bowl with beef is AMAZING. Also be sure to try the dumplings and the wonton soup! The owner is also super nice, which just adds to the whole experience. I would definitely recommend Five Spice!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I used to live in bowness and now I live about 40 min away and I still drive here every week for there amazing delicious satay beef pho and dumplings. It's the best I've ever had, great spice and quality meat.  Recommend this place to everyone!! I've been going for about a year and a half and always the same amazing food every time."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Vietnamese subs. When I found out that there was a restaurant in Montgomery that served exactly that, I was stoked.

Atmosphere - I ordered takeout so I only had a quick look around. The place was very small but seemed very clean.

Food - Strictly speaking from a Vietnamese sub standpoint, it was just okay. I ordered the house special and it had everything I expected in it, but there was nothing special at all about it. There are places in Chinatown/downtown that offer a much more diverse flavor profile. Other reviews had mentioned how great their noodle soups were, so I might go back and try that next time.

Value - A bit more expensive than your typical Vietnamese food joint.

Overall - If I am in the area and craving a Vietnamese sub, I would stop by. Otherwise, I prefer the subs served in Chinatown/downtown."}
{"text":"So delicious here. I went twice in one week. I had the mix dumplings on both days and then BBQ chicken fried rice one day and a beef sate stir fry the other. It's just great food. Definitely not the grease I am used to at Asian restaurant. Friendly lady. Except the Chili hot sauce portions are very small. They also have a great selection of frozen already prepared dishes you can take with you. And it's all MSG free."}
