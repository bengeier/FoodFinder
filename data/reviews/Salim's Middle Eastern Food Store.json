{"text":"I am all for ethnic/specialty grocery stores!  It's the only way to get authentic obscure ingredients!  

The location is super convenient.  There's parking.  It's very clean and organized.  The food smells delicious, but I have not had a chance to try it yet.  And, the service is friendly and helpful!

Definitely stop by if you're in need of some middle eastern food or supplies!"}
{"text":"I was slightly disappointed in Salim's.  It's close to my apartment, and I love middle eastern food, so I had high hopes, but the gyro meat was not great, the baba ganoush was ok, and the grape leaves were average.  The baklava was pretty good, but it is a rather small portion."}
{"text":"I didn't think the gyro would be enough (smallish in size) BUT it was surprisingly filling and a good price! And the baklava - so so good!"}
{"text":"Im giving this place four stars more for sentiment than taste, but their food is decent. The falafel and gyro sandwiches are both on the small side but tasty and made in a flash. They have basic middle eastern groceries as well as a few hot dishes and classic desserts such as baklava and cashew fingers. A great place to get feta, dolmas , tabouli, or hummus. The baba ganouj is excellent."}
{"text":"Best hommos, gyros, and baklava.  The owner and staff are always very friendly too.  Great place all around."}
{"text":"People seem to have confused this Salim's, a Middle Eastern market and lunch counter on Centre between Oakland and Shadyside, with Salem's Market and Grill, a massive cafeteria-style restaurant and Middle Eastern market on Penn at the north end of the Strip District, or that store's parent location Salem Halal Market, a small Middle Eastern market and lunch counter on Bouquet in southern Oakland..."}
{"text":"The best babaganoush I've ever had, other lovely dishes as well, and Salim is super friendly."}
{"text":"Very friendly owner, and very great food! Salim's has been a favorite of mine for some time. Gyro, Gyro Salad and Platters are all delicious! Hummus, pita chips, and grape leaves are all really good. For a sweet, I LOVE getting the Cashew Fingers! They are really sticky, but very good."}
{"text":"The restaurant food is delicious, fresh, and abundant.  Yes, you will be taking some home!  The grocery store area has lots of choices and specialty items.  The halal meat is the best around and fresh.  Well worth visiting , shopping, and eating there.  Staff are also knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"delicious, finally a good falafel place in Pittsburgh. Go here instead of leena's in Oakland. Falafel wrap is amazing, with lots of falafel and pita was warm and very fresh. Tabbouleh salad to go was great, and the dressing wasn't added until I paid which prevented the salad from getting too mushy. I will definitely be going back here, often."}
{"text":"girlfriend and i enjoyed our meal here. the prices were great. this was my first gyro (girlfriend had the falafel) in the city so i have nothing to compare it to (and i hope that changes soon). will return."}
{"text":"Gyro was good and so was the Greek salad. Will definitely return to try something else"}
{"text":"Salim always makes me feel welcome, and the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Very fair prices and extremely tasty gyros. I recommend the Baklava. If I ever stop in Pittsburgh again, I'm eating here!"}
{"text":"This is the thing I miss the most about Pittsburgh. Salim's has the best gyros I have ever had. their cheese pies and meat pies are also delicious. They make everything in house. We ate at Salim's at least once a week and never had bad food or bad service. We were always greeted with a \"hello my friends' and left with a grateful \"thank you\". You are doing yoru self a disservice by not eating here."}
{"text":"I finally found the courage to try Salim's baba ganoush. I only wish I had done so sooner! The man knows his eggplants. I think it is safe to say he has the best ganoush in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"This is my favorite gyro in Pittsburgh, then again, I am anti-diarrhea, so that excludes Mike and Tony's and other excessively wet-meat gyros (if I were a politician, I'd make my anti-diarrhea stance well known).  The gyros are just very clean (a little smaller, if you're not planning on ordering sides and are starving, get two), and fresh tasting.  I love the lamb and tzatziki sauce, there is no better gyro in Pittsburgh.  Salim also serves unbelievable sides.  Tabouleh, baba ganoush, and spinach/feta pies are all tasty.  I used to live right next to the place, and everytime I went in there, Salim was working and was incredibly generous. (I am a sucker for flattery, and he would always address me as \"my friend\").  Now, there is zero ambiance here, so if that's your thing, go somewhere else.  It's also a small grocery store, and Salim don't mess around with lame decor, he lets his food do the talking.  This is honestly more appropriate as a lunch spot, but that's neither here nor there.  I feel like this is a bit of a hidden gem, and thus wouldn't draw any tourist types, but those people are a hassle anyways.

IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND:  Velvet Underground.  Known to only a few, but had some of the best music at the time (that no one really heard)."}
{"text":"Good food and a pretty good selection of groceries. Sometimes the food is a little too dry, and some would say that it is too expensive, but I like it.

There is a $10 minimum on credit cards, which sucks if you just want dinner or something, but you can always buy a dozen feta and spinach rolls....MMMmmmmm"}
{"text":"Delicious. The inside of this place looks like it use to be a BINGO hall or something equally open-spaced. The food is served cafeteria style and tantalizes you from behind a glass display.

I had the kefta, which was a seasoned patty of lamb and beef. It was on a warm, chewy pita and tasted  great. The light sauce mixed with the veggies (they added a middle eastern style pickled cucumber) were a crunchy, delicious combo.

For dessert we got this mesmerizingly orange dessert that I later learned was called Jalebi. It was light and airy and completely drenched in delicious, sweet syrup. It was interesting to say the least.

The grocery next door is incredible as well, especially the butcher's area. Fresh meat hangs on hooks right in front of you and the people manning the counter are willing to answer your questions. My friend ended up buying pre-seasoned kefta meat for later after one of the employees suggested a serving size for him.

I'll definitely come back here and take photos next time."}
{"text":"I am new to PGH and was hoping to find some great arab food in the area. Salim's was EXCELLENT. I went with my mom (we are Lebanese) and tried the chicken pita sandwich, the kibbeh (which was fried fresh, right in front of us), and the tabouleh. Everything was excellent and full of flavor. Price was very affordable, ingredients very fresh. It tasted like my families own recipe, very authentic! 

Salim was also very kind, friendly, and knowledgeable. I will definitely be coming back for some more good, Lebanese food in the future! I cant wait to try everything else on the menu. 

Of note - the menu has no breakdown of what is in the specials, ingredients in the pita pockets, or prices on everything offered in the store, but I'm sure Salim would answer any question anyone has."}
{"text":"If you need a quick, cheap meal that is both flavorful and filling, I would recommend you stop by at Salim's. This is a great little Middle Eastern Food Store that has serves the standard fare of gyros (chicken and lamb) in a pita or over rice for very reasonable prices. I got the gyro rice plate and the chicken rice plate, which both came with heaps of flavorful meat, a good amount of rice and really fresh, crunchy salad. What really makes Salim's stand out though is that, unlike other gyro spots which serve plain white rice with their food, Salim's makes a spiced rice with vermicelli that perfectly complements the flavors of their gyro and chicken meat. 

Note: Salim's doesn't offer curries (as some some of the pictures here suggest) and it is not to be confused with Salems Market & Grill on Penn Ave."}
{"text":"I love the food here, plus I also use the store to buy ingredients.  The spinach pies are great.  The Hummus, Baba Ghanough, and Taboulee are made fresh and taste delicious.  Also love the Sleek.  There's a Middle Eastern place in the strip, but Salim's is much more consistent and is much more likely to have what I am looking for."}
{"text":"Very nice. Had the gyro. Very good gyro. The sauce used for the gyro is what makes it so delish. The other toppings were nothing special. Will be back for more. Cashew fingers were only a 'meh' for me."}
{"text":"We visited because of the superb rating on Yelp. We met Salim himself. He is very gracious and kind. He helped us decide on the menu. Everything is made fresh. Excellent meal. I will gladly return.  It has a nice seating area and he sells authentic groceries for you to take home. Delicious. Thank you Salim. Thank you Yelp for bringing us together."}
{"text":"I stopped by last night to get some take out, since it's that time of week when I'm getting sick and tired of the usual swill, and I'm just about fresh out of groceries.  This place is about a block from my apt., and I've passed it about a thousand times, but I never would have thought to stop by if it weren't for Yelp.  (Sidenote: I really need to try the ready-to-eat food at some of the other ethnic markets in the area!)

Based on the reviews here, I decided to try the falafel and the spinach pie.  I honestly can't remember the last time I had falafel--it's been years (don't judge!).  Since I live so close, I got them both for take out, though, as others have mentioned, there is some seating if you prefer to eat in.  Together, they cost under $8.  The older gentleman--who I assume is the owner--made the falafel pita as I waited, and retrieved the spinach pie from the display case (he asked me if I wanted it heated, which I did, so he warmed it up in the microwave).  He seemed very friendly, answering my stupid questions about the falafel pita (yes, it comes with all the fixings), and making conversation with me about my travels in S.E. Asia (I was wearing a Cambodia t-shirt).

When I got home, I promptly tucked into the falafel sandwich and then the spinach pie after pouring myself a glass of iced tea to accompany them. The falafel pita was quite savory, and I enjoyed the variation in texture and flavor that the vegetables and pita offered.  I'd advise eating it as quickly as possible, though, since despite not wasting time in eating it, it was cooler than I'd like by the time I was halfway through.  The spinach pie, on the other hand, remained quite warm, despite that I saved it until after I'd finished the falafel pita.  Although it was a bit soggier than I'd like on the bottom, the flavors were quite delectable--even more so than the falafel pita, in my opinion.  Both the falafel pita and the spinach pie were clearly homemade.  For me, the two of these items were sufficient for a meal, esp. since I've been trying to eat on the lighter side recently.  If you're a heavy eater, however, you may wish to get another sandwich or side.

While I was ordering, I noticed this place serves gyros and Middle Eastern desserts.  I'll definitely keep this in mind for next time I want a gyro or some baklava!  It's awesome to find another great hole-in-the-wall place so close to my apt.--thanks, fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"the best gyro in pittsburgh, and perhaps anywhere i have ever been.

i was introduced to salim's food when he catered monthly gyro fundraisers at central catholic high-school. he also catered my brother's graduation party which was awesome. can you imagine how sweet it was to have those leftovers at your house??

the storefront has a good selection of middle-eastern ingredients to buy and a sizable dining area to eat-in. definitely one of pittsburgh's best kept secrets."}
{"text":"Yum. That should say it all, but I guess more would be helpful. Salims simply has the best, least-expensive, healthy, portable, study-time food, ever.

When you need to concentrate, but need to eat and are afraid of ending up with something that either will make you feel over-stuffed, heavy and sleepy or, conversely, leave you feeling hungry in an hour, you need to go to Salim's on Center Ave (convenient parking off-street on the side of the building). 

Get a container of Mujadera (lentils and rice with browned onions. He will heat it for you. If you eat meat, you can have some added to it. 

Get another container of chilled and flavourful tabouli salad and eat them alternating bites. 

Buy a container of Salim's delicious rice pudding, but save it as a celebration for completing tasks/finishing your project or paper. 

Buy extra containers of everything if you are pulling an all-nighter. This is absolutely the best study/writing food ever. And so delicious! 

Salims also has a whole selection of other wonderful foods - both prepared, and hard-to-find grocery items such as Halaal meats, lokum, and various grains and canned goods. 

There is also a dining room separate from the main part of the store so you may enjoy your meal in peace. 

Whether you are new to the Pittsburgh area, or needing a new favorite place, Salim's is a \"must experience\" place - one of Pittsburgh's most delightful hidden culinary treasures."}
{"text":"I stopped by to pick up a snack before dinner and ended up purchasing a spinach and feta handpie, a tub of homemade hummus, pita, and a half dozen baklava bites. The handpie dough was a little soggy but the filling was amazing and packed with flavor. The hummus is very good, the pita is doughier than im used to but still good. The baklava bites were fantastic, and at .60 each they're a steal."}
{"text":"Salim's is the consummate place to pick up quick and satisfying snacks. I love his babaganoush and vegetarian stuffed grape leaves. And his hummus is some of the best around. Not my favorite spinach pies in town, but you can't win 'em all. You can also count on Salim's for basic Mediterranean grocery items. We just picked up some pomegranate syrup (real grenadine) to experiment with."}
{"text":"Food here is always great. Place looks insignificant from the outside- I think they make most of their money from catering. Guys who run the place are always super friendly and helpful. Low prices and it doubles as a grocery store. I suggest buying some baba ganoush  to go. Kind of place you stop into for lunch or a snack."}
{"text":"So glad we were able to discover this little shop, which surprisingly doubles as a small sit-down restaurant. When you walk in you will first see the shelves of herbs and spices, along with a counter for freshly made food. Look to the left and there's a little doorway leading to a cozy little area with several tables and chairs for eating in, along with some freezers for some halal meats and vegetables. 

At the counter, there were quite a few items from which to choose. We chose to go with a create-your-own type of meal, which consists of three items plus pita. Lots of variety--definitely more than you might find at say Kebab Factory. The gyro and chicken were fantastic meats, while the hummus went well with the pita bread. The lentils and grape leaves also made very good sides, and the spinach pie was pretty unique. And all for about $16 (2 of these combos), which is super affordable.

On the way out we bought a small dessert platter for about $12, which came with about 4 pieces of each of the desserts (baklava, mini bites, etc.). Tried some of it after getting home and it was awesome. This is definitely a go-to place for the future for Mediterranean cravings."}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem. I first went to Salim's a few years ago with friend of mine who bought me a falafel. It was amazing and I was hooked! After that I started taking trips over there for some of my weekly shopping items and I made sure to bring my friends there at every chance I got. 

I would go and buy my hummus, spinach pies, his special dressing (he sells it if you ask him too) and tabbouleh salad. It use to be he would serve it to you and now he has it set up where you go like you are in a grocery store and just pick things out.  

He also has a cute little cafe set up next to his store front. So if you are in the mood for a quick bite to eat this is the place to go.

Salim is very friendly and if you ever have questions he's happy to answer them. It's really the best hidden secrete in the city. I don't live in Pittsburgh anymore but still visit my family and whenever I'm in town I really stock up for my drive home to Bethlehem, PA."}
{"text":"Can't beat this place for deliciousness and value!  Its the only non-home cooked food that my MOM craves!"}
{"text":"My favorite little ethnic market. I've been getting my shisha here every week for over a year. When I left my debit card at home, the owner let me take my purchase and just pay for it on my next visit! I've never been treated so well by a business before. I plan to shop here for a long time to come!"}
{"text":"Gyros, baba ganoush, falafel & baklava were all excellent. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I am so confused. I had the falafel gyro and it was definitely not that good. (And served with pickles? How strange.) Actually, I want to say that it was \"awful\" just to try to balance out all the other reviews that claim it's delicious--but really, it was simply not very good. Definitely cheap though. Tasted like frozen falafel or something--bland, basically. And pickles?

The baklava was great, though. But if this is Pittsburgh's best falafel then I am a sad man."}
{"text":"Salim is super super nice and patient. His food, especially babaganush (I can't spell it) and some sort of roasted pepper and walnut dips are amazing. Also his homemade yoghurt is awesome!"}
{"text":"Salem's is a great store almost as great as the owner (nicest man who is honest with the food). 
I love stopping in here for their sweets which are always reasonably priced (a dollar, give or take a few cents) and fresh. They also have a great selection of spices - for those recipes that call for the most random, obscure ingredients, I just check in at Salims. 

I haven't gotten their meals here yet but definitely looking forward to the day that i do!"}
{"text":"Super friendly owner.  If you have a moment, hang around and talk to him for a bit.

Everything on the menu is great.  Gyros are awesome and the plates are fantastic as well.  Fridge in the back has freshly made hummus and it's some of the best stuff I've had.  Also consider grabbing some baklava.

Really, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I made the walk out to Salim's today for a gyro. The quality was fine, and it was very filling for only $5.25. I also picked up some Turkish Delights which I have not managed to find elsewhere within walking distance of Pitt's campus. There were also several trays filled with fresh Middle Eastern desserts such as Baklava."}
{"text":"I love Salim's! I've been coming here for years, and the food is always so good. My favorite is the Falafel Sandwich, and the baked pita chips are really yummy too. Salim is a great as well, he's always friendly and nice to chat with. My favorite place for lunch!"}
{"text":"The best Falafel I have tested in Pittsburgh so far."}
{"text":"i've only been here once for lunch, but i can't think of a single thing to complain about. the greek-style home-cooked food was delicious and there were so many choices. i didn't buy anything to go in the store, but the selection was very large and pretty interesting. also, the prices were quite reasonable and salim was super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The owner is very nice and friendly and very organized! you can just tell!
Good food! Literally everything on the menu is GOOD! Yes, I've tried them all."}
{"text":"Great fresh and tasty gyros here. Visit Salim and you'll be in and out pretty quickly with a delicious, generously portioned gyro. The baklava and other desserts in the case are also delicious and everything is reasonably priced. There is a dining area with a few tables but I see a lot people getting takeout, myself included. It's a great option if you live nearby and aren't feeling like cooking."}
{"text":"OMG the tabbouleh is magnificent!! And the baklava...holy moly. My boyfriend is as nutty about the gyros as I am about the tabbouleh. 
You won't find fresher ingredients elsewhere.
Do yourself a favor and have lunch here as soon as you can."}
{"text":"This place is really very good. I pass by this establishment every single day and it's so close to me that I cannot believe that I've waited until now to try it!

I walked in and was immediately greeted by the owner who was by himself and is the sweetest and most welcoming man ever. I didn't feel rushed to order and he happily answered any questions that I had. (They accept card but there's a +$0.75 charge for orders under $7).

I got one of the specials: a sandwich with a side of rice or Greek salad with a bottle of water for $7.95. So I got a gyro (beef/lamb) with a Greek salad. And it was out super fast and it was SO DELICIOUS!! There's so much meat and the veggies were super fresh. The Greek salad and the vinaigrette dressing that came with it was fantastic. Everything was really fresh and crisp, I did not feel guilty about eating this food at all. Though the gyro may be a little smaller, there's a ton of stuff on the inside that it more than makes up for it. You get a lot of salad too! I am definitely going to be stopping by here more often and I am so glad that I got to try this place out today."}
{"text":"Salim's is THE BEST. The service is perfection, the food is scrumptious, and the spices for sale are rock bottom prices and sky high in flavor. Do not miss the mujadara (lentils and rice), I have no idea what they are adding to this, but it is heavenly. The meat and spinach pies are beautifully prepared, avoiding the dreaded spinach sogginess that sometimes happens. The dessert pastries are light and airy, a must indulge delicacy. In my many visits to Salim's, I have never had a bad meal."}
