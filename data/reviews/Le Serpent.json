{"text":"My favorite meal in Montreal! The food was so good! All the food was fresh from the kitchen, piping hot! We had the kit of three and foie gras parfait to start. Kit of three is nice, sashimi-like, but not spectacular. Foie gras was really good. Great textures on the plate. The linguini with speck was delicious. Perfectly al dente and a great combination of flavors, savory, slightly salty, and that oomph of umami. I had wished I didn't have to share it. The venison was cooked just right. For dessert,the chocolate cake was a perfect ending. I'm usually not a fan, but this one was rich but not too heavy. Service was efficient. Place was cozy and chic. Loved it."}
{"text":"Cool new resto. Food was awesome- great lobster risotto, beet salad, rabbit agnolotti. Reasonable prices. Decor is industrial- could have benefitted from some mood lighting and comfy chairs. Overall, a great meal for good price. Would return again."}
{"text":"Great place, food is just wow! Staff is extremely friendly. Go for Garganelli with pistachios."}
{"text":"It was very hard to get reservations on NYE anywhere in Montreal. Le Serpent was undecided on opening for NYE three weeks prior... I called everyday hoping they changed their minds. I'm so glad they did! They made our new year so memorable from their amazingly delicious food to the top notch service we got from our waiter, Sam. Let's start off with the Food.
* Kit -French inspired sashimi 3 ways-very nice starter 
*venison tartare- to die for 
*truffle linguini with candy bacon and cauliflower- a must try. So freaking good 
*rabbit tart- yes!!! The flavors just bursts in your mouth
*Kobe beef flank and lobster.- so tender, so juicy, so goood! 

The atmosphere was chic and casual. Le serpent is not seen from the streets and can be easily missed, look for a warehouse style place. Its a hidden gem. It's a must when visiting Montreal!"}
{"text":"We were just me and my husband, had no trouble finding the place (which is walkable from downtown Montréal ±15 min.) The place is an old industrial space that was converted, trendy pleasant and comfortable. 
My husband and I arrived a few minutes before our reservations and were seated right away, the greet was very professional as we left our coats at the entrance. We were explained the menu and specialties, opted to share the octopus as an appetizer (a delicious discovery) followed by the lobster risotto for me and the salmon for my husband... which both melted in our mouths! We accompanied our meal with a bottle of Pinot blanc from Wann (highly recommend it! priced at 56$), a private import, and indulged a selection of cheeses to end our meal. 
The whole thing cost us  137 + tx. and service which we thought was a very decent price.
Would definitely go back! :)"}
{"text":"Went to Le Serpent in Dec 2014 for office xmas dinner. It's a cool place with industrial look. Make sure you look for the small sign outside, otherwise you might end up passing by it. Not cool when the city is in the middle of a snow storm ( *wink wink)

Food is good, pretty diverse for this kind of restaurant, however I found portions to be pretty small. $30 for 2 medium size veal medallions as main dish..meh. I find it expensive if you get just the main dish without entree + appetizer.

Service was good, can't complain. Overall a good place, but not the kind of restaurant where you want to go with an empty stomach unless you're ready to dish out 50-60$ for entree, appetizer and main dish. Not impressed. Fancy"}
{"text":"Very creative neo italian food. Hype place in an industrial environment."}
{"text":"Italian food with Asian ingredient inspiration, perfect combination. Sweet service, contemporary industry design, total Griffintown style ."}
{"text":"Tout le repas était très bon, l'ambiance aussi, bien éclairé. Les prix sont raisonnables en tenant compte de tout ce que nous avons prit!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, good service, \"industrial\" decor is pretty meh (high ceilings, pretty empty, \"cold,\" not much atmosphere). Surprisingly good prices though (relatively speaking) especially the wine list.

The first few steps into the place aren't going to set the scene/mood for a great romantic date, but the food is spot on and value for money is probably the best in the city for this caliber of restaurant. Not as heavy as chasse et peche, but just as delicious."}
{"text":"Without a doubt one of the finest restaurants I have been to . The staff are all outstanding in smile and service with passion and love . The food and presentation are 7 stars . Overall it is a must to try ."}
{"text":"Restaurant à découvrir, ambiance très agréable et quoi dire de la nourriture... un vrai régal!"}
{"text":"Extraordinary food but a little bit expensive. Very friendly service but also slow. Those are the two reasons why doesnt get 5 stars."}
{"text":"AMAZING! The food, the ambiance, the service! The place has an amazing energy and vibe. The food is spectacular! Must haves: Lobster risotto, linguini, and the maple pudding, YUMS! We loved this place so much we came back the very next night! This is a must try."}
{"text":"Awesome food, very tasty, service and ambiance are great
Hard to find if you didnt do google street view before going, but definitely worth the trip"}
{"text":"We probably had the best meal of our lives here! We started with the Vichyssoise which was absolutely incredible. Then we had the Octopus which was also delicious (I preferred the first, but my fiancé preferred this dish) and then had the freshest pasta dishes! It tasted as if the pasta was rolled out specifically for us. We finished our meal with the tiramisu. Every single dessert sounded fabulous. As a nut allergy sufferer, I rarely get to pick from the full dessert menu, so it felt great to get to pick from 5-6 choices! Overall, awesome food, great service and cool ambiance. Would love to come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance with a mixed of industrial, trendy and chic decor. Suitable for a small group or a date. 

For entrees, we chose the Kit of Three - sashimi-style bass, albacore and salmon served in three different dressing - salty, citric and sweet. Delicious first course which opens up your tastebuds. Portions in this dish are small, but can still be share among two people and get room to try another entree. 

Second entree we ordered is the Octopus. Well cooked and a good complement to our first choice. Not as amazing as the Kit of Three. 

For main course, I had the Linguini, speck, almonds, cauliflower and truffle brunoise. This dish is amazingly delicious with its mixed of flavours. A must try I would say. 

My friend tried the Bucatini, pork flank confit black garly and soy. This is good, but very fatty - 80% of the piece of meat is fat. 

Practically full from the previous dish, we ordered a lighter dessert of Dacquoise, lemon, kumquat, creme fraiche and white chocolate. This is not too heavy so it ended well our meal."}
{"text":"Excellent. Period. 

such a good vibe. 

make a reservation. So good. 

Do yourself a favor and make this part of your next stop to Montreal"}
{"text":"Mérite ses 5 étoiles. L'accueil est plus que chaleureux. L'assiette originale et goûteuse à souhaits. Figure très certainement à mon top 5 de Montréal. Ne manquez pas le risotto au homard ou les linguinis. Je sors ravi à chacune de mes visites."}
{"text":"Food selection is not big but the dishes they have are good. I did not give them 4 stars as the food felt that it was lacking in some flavor. Difficult to put my fingers on what was missing but it just lacked the ooomfff."}
{"text":"The chefs of Le Serpent put their names on their menus and you can taste/see why.  This is  not a place for good eats, but it is a great place to try culinary creations.  Even when I disagree with the chef, I would still give 5 star for the craftsmanship."}
{"text":"Avons eu la chance de déguster un repas magnifique en famille.  Le plaisir de partager les plats comme le veut la tradition italienne, ce qui nous permets  de goûter à différents plats. La nourriture y est excellente.  De la tartelette au lapin en passant par le risotto ou un bon orsotto au jarret de veau.  Sans oublier bien entendu les desserts aussi excellents et un bon américano pour terminer.  Malgré le fait qu'on ne peut y apporter notre vin, la carte qui nous est offertes est sans contredit, volumineuse.  Le service y est excellent et les gens chaleureux.  Pour nous, c'est un endroit à garder dans notre répertoire de restaurants où retourner."}
{"text":"Le Serpent was hands down one of the best restaurants I've been to in any city.  The food was absolutely incredible!  I didn't even know that pork jowl could taste that good.  This is a place where the portions aren't so large, and you'll definitely want to savor your food - because every bite is filled with flavor.

It's a little bit hard to find - the sign isn't terribly large, and it's on an industrial looking building.  The ambience is very industrial, and the place is slightly crowded and relatively expensive.  However, the food and service make this place totally worth the price."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for 4 days and this was the worst meal. Portions are small, the drinks are served in practically a shot glass.  The food was not good and overpriced. Needless to say we were disappointed. I will not be recommending this place. Go to Boris instead food is outstanding there."}
{"text":"Le serpent does not live up to the reputation of its cousins, Le Filet and Chasse et Peche, however neither do the prices. 

I've eaten here twice, once for lunch which was pretty good and on another occasion for dinner which was somewhat disappointing. 

The atmosphere is lively and modern and the menu is full of creative and beautifully presented dishes. However, they were off the mark on a couple of areas. Together with my friends we had the opportunity to sample a selection of dishes most of which were good. However, there were a couple of major short comings. One was a pasta dish that we shared. The dish was so salty that it would have been impossible for one person to have eaten the entire plate. When we mentioned this to our server I didn't get the impression that it really registered. The other menu item that was questionable was the octopus. The Octopus should have been the highlight of the dish, but it was buried in a highly acidic garnish that completely over powered the flavour of the octopus. 

Of note is that they have a daily rotisserie special which is well worth ordering."}
{"text":"fabulous service, ambiance and decor. the food was also delicious! tucked away in a quieter neighborhood, but certainly worth going back to."}
{"text":"Best restaurant I've been to in Montreal. The service was great with really knowledgeable staff. My colleague and I sat at he bar and the bar tenders made several cocktails for us, each were great. The linguini truffle dish was my favorite! I'll return for sure."}
{"text":"Woooow !

Ce restaurant est incroyable ! Une très belle découverte ! Nous avons commencé par le crudo en entrée c'était excellent. Par la suite nous avons éssayé un petit plat de pates en 2e service. C'est sincèrement les MEILLEURES pates que j'ai mangé de toute ma vie. Des pates maison, assaisonnés à la perfection. Pour finir, nous avons mangé la côte de boeuf Tomahawk, une morceau de boeuf de près d'un kilo !! Ce mastodonte culinaire était toute une experience pour nos estomacs et pour nos papilles gustative ! 

Vraiment 10/10 pour se restaurant qui est très jolie en passant."}
{"text":"I ate here in Montreal with several of my colleagues. The place was difficult to find with only a barber pole marking its entrance but the food was worth the search! It claims to be a fusion of Japanese and Italian but really sushi was the only Asian item on the menu. Regardless, the motto of the restaurant is \"we have the best diners because people find us\"   And it truly live up to that!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, bon choix de vin. Les pâtes sont délicieuses! Surtout ceux au speck!"}
{"text":"This is definately a winner! Loved it, staff, food, ambiance, all made for a lovely night out. Here for a wedding the maitre de was kind  enough to accommodate our party of 8 on short.notice. . Staff was very friendly and attentive which made  us feel we comfortable. The food was simply amazing and that is an achievement considering the special diets and picky eaters in our party. Everyone raved about the food, I personally  can vouch for the branzino for two, which was both a visual and gastronomic delight. Just a delightful evening  all the way around  will dsfinaat see my be  back on our next trip!"}
{"text":"A culinary experience indeed!  Minimalistic decor on the inside of the restaurant.  And, you can barely see the sign from the outside. The food speaks for itself.  Lots of flavors and spices and pairing of different flavors of  foods.  If your a foodie, you have to try this place.  The food is off the hook!"}
{"text":"This industrial landscape turned urban dining hot spot mesmerized me. Reviews of le serpent will not fail you. The wine selection and menu are of only high quality. Ensure to wait in the front to be placed by the hostess!"}
{"text":"We came in to this bright-with-sunshine warehouse space upon recommendation of our hotel concierge for an early dinner, and we were not too hungry. But... oh. My. God. Trio of three? Yes please Sir, may I have another? And let me tell you something- their seasonal vegetable plate is off the hook.  Yummiest thing ever.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Mon coup de coeur est le Tiramisu auquel le serveur ajoute un espresso minute à la table.

Côté vin, on retrouve une belle sélection de bouteilles à partir de 35$.

Mon risotto au homard, betteraves jaunes, basilic et mascarpone était délicieux. J'ai vraiment aimé

Côté facture?  Une centaine de dollars pour 2."}
{"text":"Love the discreet entrance and artsy feel. The oysters were fabulous and great wine selection. We had the oxtail lasagna which was good but not outstanding hence the 4* vs 5."}
{"text":"I give it a 4 for the ambiance and because my group really liked the food. Portions are small and you'll have to order at least 2 plates to eat enough (even 3). Service was great. Unfortunately, the place is better suited for meat eaters and if you're eating vegan/vegetarian like me, you'll be disappointed that there are not too many things on the menu. They made me a vegan risotto with red wine, it was like eating pure wine with some nuances. Had I not been drinking red wine, perhaps the meal would have been better - but the pairing was not a match made in heaven. Anyhow, all the other meat eaters loved their food and would go back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Amazing food and environment! Totally worth the price. Best montreal food experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food. One of the best risotto I had this side of the Atlantic. Wine selection is more than adequate, service was near perfect.  Will go back."}
{"text":"Service was great for Montreal. Food was good, apps were very tasty but recommended filet was a bad choice, very bland and wasn't worth the price. Overall a good experience but definitely wouldn't go for steak."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING. The service was stellar. The server, hostess, and bussers went out of their way to help us out. The food was stellar. The carpaccio and the first pasta on the menu (I think linguine) were absolutely amazing. It's a super sexy location as well."}
{"text":"Can't decide if you want sushi or Italian? Have someone good at finagling reservations? Then get yourself to Le Serpent, the hottest ticket in town. Located in a jumble of warehouses, it is edgy and artsy from the minute you walk through the door till the small, beautiful plates arrive at your table. The crudo was a poem. I had orichietti and a cod entree with chanterelles and courgettes. Dessert was raspberry mousse and sorbet. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"From the outside, Le Serpent doesn't look like much: a discrete entrance, just another warehouse next to more warehouses. The magic happens as soon as you cross the door: the decor is chic and classy, but incorporating industrial components like brick and steel. The service was impeccable! Our waitress took the time to answer all our questions, without any pretentiousness. 

You must take the \"Kit of three\", a trio of sashimi: albacore (which literally melts in your mouth), striped bass and salmon. Warning though: the portions are smaller than what you'd expect. 
After this entree, we had the pistachio garganelli and the marinated salmon on rosti. We both loved our dishes. 
The fish was semi-raw, just the way I prefer it. It was flaky and tender, but didn't have so much flavor by itself. Paired with the rosti, it was perfect! 

We were disappointed by the dessert however: we had the maple pudding, biscuit breton with olives and compressed apple. The first few bites were delicious; the sweetness of the pudding balanced out perfectly the saltiness of the olive-flavored butter biscuits and the slight tartness of the apple. However, the pudding-to-biscuit ratio was way off, and eating the overly sweet pudding by itself became almost... off-putting (no pun intended). I do admire the originality of the dessert though (I mean, olives and maple? Who would have thought of that?)

I'd definitely go back, but pick another dessert this time."}
{"text":"It's ok, nothing incredible. We had oysters, the tartar trio, the lobster risotto and the duck. Oysters are oysters, not a big fan of their mignonette. The Tatars were ok. The lobster risotto I found had too much mascarpone in it and didn't quite fit the acidity of the tomatoes they use. Duck was delicious, well executed. Service was attentive and the drinks were good. We had asked to have our plates come out slowly so we can enjoy ourselves there and have a few drinks. We were done eating in 1.15 minutes so obviously rather expéditive. 300$ or so, a bit on the pricey side for the overall experience."}
{"text":"Dessert is amazing here. Next time I am ordering all desserts before any main courses. They have an award winning pastry chef here - Masami Waki. I had the best tiramisu in my life here and can't stop thinking about it!

Atmosphere is modern industrial. There is a beautiful abstract/color only painting on the back wall to the left that looks like natural light. The chairs are hard metal chairs and there are no white tablecloths, thank goodness.

Bathrooms are located outside of the main entrance, to the right. It is quite dark around there, so be careful. Next to the bathrooms we thought there was a gymnasium filled with dodge-balls on the ground, but it was part of an art display, I think. I'm not an artist, so I don't get it, but it was interesting to look at through the window on the door.

The restaurant itself was a bit hard to find but luckily the iPhone GPS revealed the location and there was plenty of street parking. There was some bizarre music performance going on nearby, outside, by a severely-hipster-man-with-beard. It was the most awful music in the world - like heavy construction machinery but worse. Luckily, it was just barely audible within the restaurant.

The food itself was very good. Portions are on the smaller side, so if you are hungry order a lot. Or just order all desserts.

I am on a healthy eating spree now, after having indulged severely on desserts here. If only I had lightning-fast metabolism... I would come to eat desserts here regularly!"}
{"text":"Great little find in Montreal - easy to miss as the location is tucked away. Great place for a fresh twist on French/Italian food. Good ambience, solid for a date place or party.

Had the bread as an appetizer, great bonus as it's not charged for. The bread we had was topped with fresh tomato sauce.

My main was the salmon confit - highly satisfied with the choice, was the most tender salmon I've ever had. The potato rosti and sour cream it comes with was a great complement to the salmon which was cooked to medium rare.

To top it off, staff were great and provided complementary dessert for the wait. Definitely would visit again."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience me and my wife were recommended here it was phenomenal. Every course from the oysters to the specials for dinner were out of this world. Must go here"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Love it! Modern industrial.
Service: Great!
Food: Depends what you order

The lobster risotto and beet salad were amazing, as was the desert! The duck was dry and lacking taste.

Great date place; check it out."}
{"text":"Picked this restaurant from some of the recent recommendations I have seen.  It's in a odd location as not much around in the evening.  Old industrial building which gives the restaurant a simple but trendy look and feel.  

Service was very friendly as soon as we walked in as someone took our coats and showed us to our table.   Super friendly waitress spoke French and English perfectly.  She took the time to explain the menu and gave some very good recommendations.

Great wine selection and varying price ranges.  

Started off with the 3 fish entry - all delicious - the bar was our favorite -  then to the lobster ravioli - OMG it was lick the plate delicious !!!   And finished with the Monday night special which was a very nice portion of delicious short ribs.   For dessert - had the tiramisu espresso - again just the right size and soooo tasty.   The restaurant was full - but with the high ceilings it was not noisy at all.  Good parking in the evening .. Will be back !"}
{"text":"This place is fancy, Rachel McAdams was eating at the table next to ours. the food is expensive but top notch! Had a great time."}
{"text":"Best duck I've had, and also largest portion.  foie gras also a must.  Outside - rundown wearhouse, inside chic modern layout, very tall ceilings.  everything on the menu is a win."}
{"text":"We snuck away to Montreal for a food vacation.  Le Serpent was our first stop and it didn't disappoint.  The atmosphere is very modern in with a renovated warehouse feel.  Make sure you know the address because it can be hard to find.  I had been looking at the menu for weeks prior to our vacation and it lived up to all my expectations.  Be sure to try the Garganelli with braised pork shoulder and the venison tartare.  Portions were perfect...my only regret is that we only did 3 courses vs. 4.

If you are looking for a quiet evening this is probably not the place.  Music was  little loud but it fit the atmosphere and crowd."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Only downfall was how small the cocktails were. We were in our teeny tiny dresses, and we wanted to feel satisfied after our meal- not stuffed. I thought the portions were fine. Four girls shared several things, from apps to entrees, and ending with dessert. We had 2 rounds of drinks, a filing meal, and topped off with dessert and some port wine. For apps, we got the crab special with avocado, oysters, and 3 kinds of fish sashimi style. For entrees, we all shared black linguine, ravioli, fish, and steak. For dessert, they specialized the menu and inserted my name instead for one of them (nice touch!) We also ordered a separate chocolate dessert. Everything was spectacular - our server was amazing. Def missing this place after I got back to NYC."}
{"text":"Odd location but good food. The space is not well marked. It almost feels like you are entering an underground club. The decor is industrial but the space is comfortable. The staff was very knowledgeable about the menu and helpful. We started with oysters, followed by a lobster risotto for me and Cornish hen with roasted vegetables for my husband. Everything was delicious. The wine list was different than most. Very nice."}
{"text":"Food was unique and amazing! The tart bread appetizer is a must and the linguine pasta was amazing. It's noisy but worth the noise! Service was friendly.
Had to update because I remembered that the table we were seated, for 4, was extremely small and felt cramped."}
{"text":"The portions are small and the pasta is overpriced. Had the kit of 3 as an appetizer, you can get the same at a nice sushi restaurant for much cheaper. Pasta is just OK tasting and def not worth the 27$ price. Wine list was great, wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"spent 2 hours and 45 minutes there for a dinner. because the food was good and service was slow. 

recommend the salmon, cooked at 53C to keep the texture and color. also the duck breast that taste like veal, confusing but fun!"}
{"text":"Big fan of this restaurant. Nestled on a side street away from all the tourists in the Old Port Serpent has a look and feel that's unique in Montreal. It's has a lofty, industrial look and my favorite place to sit is at the bar. Their risottos and wine list (discovered some incredible Austrian white wines) is fantastic as is their tiramisu!

Great for business dinners, date night and pre-hockey game. 

Enjoy"}
{"text":"Our first dinner in Montreal and it has set the bar for Montreal restaurants quite high! We ordered their daily special appetizer which was seared scallops and it was done just right! The sauce was like a hollandaise sauce and very buttery. 

The four of us ordered the rotisserie for two which was roasted whole branzino with olives, pistachio and dill. I have never had such a nice aromatic yet soft roast fish before! It was delicious! The meat was soft and the pistachio with pickled olive slices give it a very nice balance to the soft roasted meat!  It has a nice Mediterranean slant and the lime gave it a very light aftertaste!!  

The dish came with roasted veggies and the veggies were so crispy. The veggies sat on a bed of bell pepper and millet puree and the presentation was wonderful!! 

A meal cannot be complete with desserts! We ordered four desserts including the recommended Felicita! The lemon tart was very light and I find that mascarpone a bit too overpowering. The almond cake was okay and the chestnut ice cream tasted soooooo good! That alone can be a standalone offering! Felicita was the best! A chocolate cake with a nice crispy base, the mousse was not too sweet and one could tell the ice cream is homemade! Really really tasty!! The last dish is Tiramisu. Coffee was too strong and so was the chocolate. It almost tasted sour! 

Server was courteous and professional! Luv this place! Will come back for aure!!"}
{"text":"What a perfect dining experience. The Halibut was perfect. Location and ambiance were spot on."}
{"text":"Oh my god, what can I say?  This place was incredible!! My friend and I ate our way through the menu, with each course being as good as the last.  The staff was fun and engaging.  In general Quebecois folk have the joie de vie of the French without all the French toxic insanity.  Who could beat that?  

I would teleport from LA to here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Good food but small portions 
I love love their oysters and mignonette 
The lobster risotto is also very good
On the pricey side
Nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"One of the best meals my husband and I have ever had in our lives!!! This restaurant came as a recommendation from the concierge at the W Hotel.  We would have never known about it otherwise.  Fun contemporary vibe.  Fantastic service.  Prices were very reasonable.   We hope to come back to Montreal just to visit this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came to Montreal for my sister bachelorette. Came here and The food was soooooo good!! The server had excellent customer service! Everything we ordered was Very satisfying"}
{"text":"One of the best meals!  My family of 5, including 2 teenagers and a 9-year old, loved each dish.  Obviously no kids' menu, but the smaller pasta portions were just fine.

Standouts included each pasta dish and the crudo (3 part) appetizer.  Dishes are super rich, and I would absolutely recommend the smaller portion of any pasta dish for adults.  Pair smaller pasta with an appetizer or salad and you'll be just fine.

Cocktails from the bar took a bit of time, but were perfectly made and delicious.

Our waitress was a great balance of helpfulness."}
{"text":"Perfect service and incredible food at Le Serpent.

We went there tonight and the experience was really good. Restaurant just opened couple weeks ago and everything detail is just good. I would only like more info on the wine selection. 

Le Filet and Chasse et Peche still on top of my list...but this one is going to be a top 10 in Montreal"}
{"text":"I have been to Le Serpent for lunch several times because it's close to my place of employment. I love the look - high ceilings, clean lines, minimalist décor. And it's sort of hidden so it's a bit mysterious. The service is impeccable. The menu is small but diverse. I think it's a great option for a lovely lunch. The lunch menu prices are reasonable!"}
{"text":"Arty, minimal, modern atmosphere. AKA don't dress like a slob. Plates are elegantly presented and food options are minimal but seasonally on point. More seasonal than cultural in taste, I guess you can describe it as Modern North American... I'm not a foodie...
 A range of salads, soup, fish dishes and meat too. I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I came here on a whim for dinner and it was by far my best meal in Montreal! From the food, to the drinks, ambience, and staff...perfect.

We started with the oysters and burrata. The maple mignonette was the perfect compliment to the fresh oysters. We also really enjoyed the crispy black chickpeas with the burrata. I had the pumpkin ravioli as my main while my date had the lobster risotto. I could eat the pumpkin raviolis for dinner every single night, they were that good. Perfectly al dente in a light but flavorful sauce. 

Great staff- friendly and attentive, loved the wine our waitress suggested. I hope to be back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great food and even greater atmosphere! The service was amazing and the food was to die for. Loved the grilled duck and the linguini with truffle brunoise. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Last night was my third visit at this resto and I can finally write the stellar review it deserves! An invite from a fellow foodie and blogger turned to an amazing evening of delicious food, great service, and memorable fun. 

The venue itself is just perfect; nice marble bar at the entry, beautiful industrial chic decor, and beautifully minimalistic tables settings. The dim lighting and dark walls add to the space and vibe. 

Our group decided to share plates to get a better feel of the menu and I'm so happy we did; every dish was as good as the next and most really stood out for the delicious play of flavours and textures. We started with the foie gras parfait, rabbit tart, and burrata; the rabbit tart was perfection, and the foie gras with the buttery brioche was delectable. 
Then came pasta!! There was not one dish that wasn't just perfectly executed and flavourful; I understand why everyone highly recommended the linguini dish but the truffle ravioli was stupendous. For mains, we opted for the pork jowl, grilled duck, and lobster risotto. Although the risotto was a little heavy on the parm for my taste, overall the dishes were very flavourful and well presented. Finally was dessert, with a chocolate cake, tiramisu, maple pudding, and citrus tart; although all were delicious, I preferred the tiramisu and chocolate cake mostly cause they aren't as sweet and I live for coffee and chocolate combos. 

The service was very attentive, from clearing the table to constantly filling our glasses, we were surely taken care of. The waitress was also very helpful with wine pairings, and I most enjoyed my chardonnay. 

This place is surely on my tops for the amazing food and service, and with a smaller price ticket for the quality of service and food, I will surely return again."}
{"text":"We gave this place a try after seeing it on many must eat lists for Montreal. We were pretty impressed with our food-though we only ordered one entree each and our waiter kept informing us that it would not be enough food (it was plenty). We ordered the tagliolini, the veal risotto, another pasta dish with pork, and the ravioli. The dishes were all excellent and unique. My biggest disappointment was my $12 Cosmo that tasted like water, so I don't suggest ordering a cocktail. Stick with wine instead. I greatly enjoyed our dinner but it is a pricy place. Also, we had trouble finding the place so yes the shady side door is the entrance."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch, food was great but service was slow at times. Pea risotto with pork belly was one of the favorites of the table, as well as zucchini flowers appetizer."}
{"text":"Unbelievable atmosphere. The space is beautiful with large windows and plenty of natural light. Decor is sophisticated and elegant, with artwork by several artists including Geneviève Cadieux.

Their menu is always changing, so I won't comment on specific dishes (I had the salmon), but in general their plating is beautiful, the dishes are detail-laden and crafted with care. Their staff is very attentive, and the servers are very knowledgable with regards to their dishes and wine menu.

One of the best in Montreal for fine dining."}
{"text":"What a great place! We came here on a Thursday night for my bachelorette party - we had 7 girls. The restaurant was extremely accommodating as we kept having to call prior to the reservation to make adjustments as we were running late (we were traveling in from the states). The management was super friendly and upon arrival had a perfect table set for us. 

The decor is very cool and the vibe of the restaurant is FUN. Walking down the street and into the front door, you would never expect such a unique restaurant hidden within the walls. 

We ordered some drinks and apps (burrata & octopus) and everything was delicious. The waitress was incredibly knowledgable about  the menu and had great recommendations. We ordered a bunch of their dishes (linguini, bucatini, lobster risotto, vegetables for the vegetarian, etc) and shared and everything I tasted was amazing. You can definitely tell the pasta is fresh and the consistently was just perfect. My favorite dish was the bucatini and I know I will continue to have dreams about it. As we did have a vegan and vegetarian, the restaurant again was incredibly accommodating despite such a limited menu for this restriction.

Overall, a wonderful experience and I highly recommend for the ambiance, the great service and delicious food."}
{"text":"Of the 2 dishes we had, 1 was overcooked (the halibut) but despite this the overall experience was superb... top notch cocktails, excellent service and the food was superb... really enjoyed all the flavors and would definitely recommend, despite the minor fish faux pas ;-)

We will definitely come back when we are in Montreal again..."}
{"text":"Great date night spot! If you are visiting Montreal for the first time would highly recommend! Everything we ordered was amazing - Duck was especially good! Great atmosphere! The space is very trendy!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant dans Griffinton, très bien caché alors ouvrez l'oeil! Dejà en rentrant, vous serez charmé par l'endroit ! Industriel, épuré et juste assez décoré pour bien balancer le tout ! 

Et que dire de la bouffe! C'est un peu cher, mais vous payerez pour de la qualité! Nous avons pris l'entrée de trois poissons crus, délicieux, avec un plat de pâtes,comme avant met principal, au porc effiloché et à l'ail noir et finalement, nous avons pris l'assiette du moment, un rôti de boeuf qui vient en entier avec l'os et qui était cuit à la perfection ! vraiment, c'est un endroit idéal pour redécouvrir les mets italiens ! 

Nous nous sommes faits offrir le dessert, un tiramisu dans une tasse, auquel il verse un shot d'espresso dessus! Ca fondait en bouche ! Vraiment du bon service avec des bonnes suggestions, nous ne sommes pas deçus ! 

Un incontournable à Montréal !"}
{"text":"Amazing. Order the oxtail ravioli and the duck. You won't regret it. The atmosphere is very cool too."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Montreal. Not only the food is exceptional, but a Great space and an extremely friendly staff... Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Went there with my girlfriend during the week, I think it was a on a Tuesday night. It was my second time at le Serpent. I absolutely enjoyed my experience, from the appetizers to the desert. Despite the fact that the portions are not very big, they make sure that was they serve are quality products with tasty accompaniments. The food was simply exquisite and makes you discover new flavors and food combinations."}
{"text":"Food: great menu with nice selection of appetizers. The beef carpaccio is to die for! The fresh burrata is melting in your mouth (highlight, must order it)
We had the lobster risotto, it was excellent, the sauce was creamy and flavourful (lobster broth) and cooked al dente which is perfect. We also had the linguini truffle pasta, it was good but not the best dish of the night.
We finished the night with 2 desserts: the tiramisu and chocolat raspberry cake. Both of them was delightful to end a nice dinner.

Ambiance: nice young professionals crowd, nice open space decor. Beautiful long marble bar counter.

Service: amazing service. They changed our plate and cutlery after each service which is a nice service attention.

Price: a little pricey for the portion but the quality of the ingredients are there.

Conclusion: a nice place to try"}
{"text":"Had the most amazing beef carpaccio served with creamy burrata. Every bite of this dish was heavenly. Compliments to the chef. Then the lobster risotto. Perfectly cooked. Delicious. The service was impeccale. Great restaurant! I'll be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Class class class. If a restaurant could be voted only on class this eatery will most likely take the first prize. What makes it 5 star that it also got the classy food to back up. 

From the moment we entered they treated us with class. Took our coats/jackets to be hung so we could enjoy the dinner with comfort. We were shown to our seats and boom our journey of a sexy restaurant night started. 

A lot of restaurants focus so much on being presentable and stylish that they lose focus on the other things. Our server was very humble yet informative about the menu. He was very detailed which helped us make our dinner choices. 

He didn't hover around and kept checking in on us at the appropriate intervals. Didn't feel rushed at all which was surprising considering how busy the place was. 

Food recommendations; the linguini. Yumm! The slight hint of truffle oil was just mind blowing. And of course the Friday evening special BBQ duck was just mouth watering. 

Since the night had been so amazing a dessert was in order and glad we didn't skip that. The chocolate roll with ice cream though sounds simple but it was just orgasmic. 

The interior is very industrial like yet feels warm. Though Friday night and I'm assuming same for sat, it's very busy and trendy. 

Looking for a place for a date night or hanging out with friends/family over scrumptious meals in Montreal then this is your destination."}
{"text":"Where to start? From the moment we walked in and realized that we had reserved on the wrong night, but efforts were still made to accommodate us, to the impeccable service and then on to the outstanding food ... Everything was just perfect! 

We are no strangers to Italian food, as it is one of our favourite countries visited based on food alone. So let me assure you that Le Serpent delivers on truly delicious Italian  food ... and more :)
It's Italy but with a twist of Asian/North American!

All the ingredients were so fresh and tasty, each dish held true to its description.
We started with the beef carpaccio served with a generous dollop of burrata (which is a fresh mozzarella stuffed with soft cream). It was divine! Best dish we've had in a while.
We followed with an excellent rabbit tartelette; flaky pastry, medium gamey meat, a bit on the saltier side though. 
For mains we had the linguini with speck, almonds and truffle bernoise. Each bite had the perfect balance of each ingredient; some crunch, some smoke and that heavenly hint of truffle! We also shared the classic lobster risotto. How can you go wrong with lobster risotto? Delicious and served Al Dente! 

Desserts did not disappoint either. We ordered the Tiramisu and were pleasantly surprised by a chocolate pistachio log, on the house! Both were pure joy and would satisfy any sweet tooth. 

Honestly if you haven't gone, go and try this place out... and then go back!  Because we know we will :)"}
{"text":"Tried three dishes and all underwhelmed. The venison tartare was surprisingly bland--no taste of truffle, little taste of soy, even the meat itself lacked gaminess. Squid ink gemelli promised a crayfish sauce with squid and cuttlefish but ended up with little shellfish flavor and heaps of basil and salt. The sea urchin risotto suffered the same imbalance--over-salted with no trace of curry as promised, the uni effectively a garnish on the plate. Everything screamed for some citrus or spice to awaken the palette. Counter service was particularly impersonal, especially after I declined alcohol (which wouldn't have salvaged the meal anyway). Not worth the trek."}
{"text":"La décoration est parfaite, l'ambiance est cool, le service par la suiteuse Marie Ève est sans faille... Et la nourriture est malheureusement seulement correcte. Aucun plat ne mérite vraiment d'y retourner a part le risotto au homard et le dessert au chocolat....le tartare de thon était beaucoup trop salé de même que la salade de crabe. La trilogie de poissons est bonne mais le pétoncle au général Tao vient tuer le goût délicat de celui ci.

On va définitivement au filet avant d'aller ici!!!"}
{"text":"Not going to lie, the entrance of Le Serpent was hard to find especially while my friend and I were being ambushed by snow coming in every possible direction, but it was worth the struggle! The interior design is quite industrial, pretty cool. The staff were really friendly and enthusiastic as they explained some of the menu items. Menus had both english and french which makes it easy for those of us who know minimal french. My friend and I ordered the kit of three to start off with, it featured three types of fish that were prepared in 3 diverse flavors. Fish was pretty fresh. For the mains we got the lobster risotto and linguine with speck, cauliflower and truffle brunoise.  The rice was al dente, and was coated nicely by the stock. Decent pieces of lobster. Overall, nicely seasoned. Just hoped there portion size could be a bit bigger. The linguine was amazing. One of the best linguine dishes I've had so far. The pasta was also al dente and coated by stock, very flavorful. Each component was great and complimented the linguine beautifully without overpowering it. Seasoning was perfect. Service was great! They accidentally forgot to put the nuts from the linguine on the side as I've requested. But they were quick to fire another one asap and our server, Ann, came and apologized for forgetting about my nut allergy and even treated us a couple of shooters on the house. The Le Serpent shooter featured apricot, amaretto, gin?, and lemon juice. Quite a refreshing touch (: all in all, tres bien and would totally recommend!"}
{"text":"Loved the food in this place. The food was delicious, a very interesting twist on modern italian. The lobster risotto and the truffle li guini were definitely the top choices. The crowd was a little bit older than expected (40s+ and even some grandparents with their family) but other than that the design and architecture is pretty cool. Our server was great in knowing what to recommend and was very nice however the service itself was not great, we had to ask for things multiple times and din't get much immediate attention."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. We had a team dinner here today and our team is admittedly demanding with our dietary restrictions and general inability to arrive on time, but the staff here is more than accommodating and our waiter, Maxime, provided the hands down the best service I've had in Montreal over my last year of time working here. 

Atmosphere aside, we shared 9 dishes and 4 desserts and they were all fantastic. Get the tiramisu, it is absolutely amazing. 

I will be moving this restaurant to the top of my recommendation list starting tomorrow. 

Tip: parking is kind of a pain, but there is a lot nearby (not the one across the street, though!)"}
{"text":"Had higher expectations for this restaurant, the rabbit appetizer with the optional ($)truffles was exquisite. The rest of the food was average for the price and reputation"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite restaurant in Montreal. It is quite simply excellent. I could talk about the food all day. It was such a creative, exciting thoughtful menu from appetizers to desserts along with really warm and welcoming service. We will definitely be back here happily!"}
{"text":"Had an incredibly memorable and delicious lunch! Enjoyed every bite!! From a beautiful decor to unique and flavourful dishes, it was a perfect experience."}
{"text":"Ok, so as you walk by and you think, \"There's no restaurant here. There are only warehouses.\" Then you know you'll arrived. We were walking down the street and I walked right by this place and had to double back because I definitely didn't think there was a legit resto inside.

We walked in and were immediately and energetically greeted by one of the bartenders. We were taken to our seats and were immediately given water. Just from that opening interaction, I was sold. Our server came over and went over the menu, but most importantly, gave us enough time to review it and make a decision. We started with the Crudi, which was 3 (very small) pieces of fish and seafood. To be specific, there was a piece of salmon, a piece of scallop, and some other type of fish. They were all served raw and prepared with different tastes. They were all delicious. One was savory, one was kinda sweet, and one was more acidic. I ordered the lobster risotto as my main dish and it was fire. It was a bit pricey for what you actually get, but I felt full after. My bf ordered the oxtail pasta and it was fiiiiirrre. It's rare that he orders something and I feel like we need to switch dishes, but let me tell you, I would have fought him for his dish. The oxtail was tender and melted in your mouth. I'm legit salivating as I type this.

The service was on point. I don't know our server's name, but she was fabulous. All in all, this was a fabulous experience."}
{"text":"On a quiet street in Montreal lies this gem that you would never know exists if walking by. Housed in a warehouse looking building and behind a mysterious black door, Le Serpent is a ultra modern restaurant that serves up some great food and offers an excellent wine selection.

I came on a Tuesday evening and dined at the bar because, well the bar is the best seat in any restaurant. Grabbed a few glasses of wine and then got the run down on the menu from the bartender. 

For my meal I had risotto and linguini. The risotto was very good and the linguini was delicious. The portions were a little on the small side, but the meals themselves were excellent. The other stand out, which kind of freaked me out a bit, was the fact that the meals were prepared and served in less than five minutes after I ordered. It was to the point where I had to ask if the food was already pre-made, to which the server replied that the chefs are just that good. Very impressive! 

All in all a great restaurant in a city that is overflowing with great dining options."}
{"text":"Pas de passion, pas d'amour, pas (peu) d'étoiles.

Installé dans un grand loft industriel, le Serpent est un restaurant à la déco industrio-moderne à la new-yorkaise assez joli, mais côté charme malheureusement, c'est proche du 0 ! Et il en va de même avec la cuisine et ce, même quand une tablée de 6 est traitée comme une reine, car l'un d'eux est un proche du patron.

La focaccia ? Sèche et totalement insipide.
Le parfait au foie gras n'a de parfait que le nom ; beaucoup trop chaud, il \"roulait dans la bouche\".
Le risotto de Homard et betterave jaune goûtait la tomate (!) et n'était vraiment pas appétissant.
La dorade grise était trop cuite et mal assaisonnée.
Le canard, une viande grasse ? Pas ici en tout cas.
La pieuvre était plutôt coriace, la mousseline de patates qui la surplombait était froide et n'avait aucune valeur ajoutée, quant à la salsa verde, je la cherche encore.

Le red velvet était ridiculement petit, sec et fade.
Le pudding au pain chocolaté ? A rayer de la carte, aussi vite que possible.

Si j'y retourne ? Seulement pour la (belle) carte de vins, qui permet de noyer son chagrin dans des crus peu connus et intéressants."}
{"text":"Some friends and I traveled to Montreal last weekend and ate at Le Serpent on Saturday. Every aspect was fantastic. The space is super cool. Great cocktails and amazing food. Probably the best foie gras I've ever had and one of my favorite restaurants to date actually. Sam was our waiter and he was the best. Super knowledgeable and so fun. The whole staff was so welcoming. Thanks Sam and Le Serpent! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant in Old Port with three other friends, so we got to try a variety of dishes through sharing amongst us. As entrée, we took oysters, cruds (raw seafood), beef carpaccio, all of them were excellent, especially the cruds, simply heavenly! And then I tried the lobster risotto, and wasn't impressed by the taste since it was too salty, but the lobster tasted good! I actually fell in love with the orzotto with beef that my friend took since it was so well balanced and the taste of beef was just amazing! The very well known linguini of Serpent also lived up to its reputation, as well as the fish plate that my other friend tried, we had a great time at this beautiful and trendy restaurant. To finish up with a sweet touch, we tried the citrus tart, and it was just AMAZING! Try it! Reserve early to make sure to get a spot since this restaurant is quite busy!"}
{"text":"If you ask me to recommend a good restaurant for fresh seafood and italien cuisine, this will be the one!!
I went there with two friends. We shared an oysters. Soooooo freeeeesh!
For the main dish, I got lobster risotto. It was so good. The flavour was balanced. The rice was neither too hard nor too sticky. One of my friends got duck meat. It burned a little bit from outside, but the meat inside was delicious! It was not too dry and it had a little bit grilled flavour. Another friend got truffle spaghetti. It tasted so good!
The service is spotless. I also like the ambiance and decorations in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Our experience at Le Serpent was incredible. We came on a Thursday evening around 1830 and were seated immediately. 

Although my partner and I were underdressed and do not speak French, the wait staff were welcoming, patient, and helpful. My only complaint was actually finding the entrance! It would be encouraging if some hours were posted on the door, I was not sure if I was at the right place or the restaurant was open!

Our meals were simply incredible. The food portions were reasonable, cooked to perfection and amazingly seasoned. Cocktails were also excellent.

Overall one of the top 5 a la carte dining experiences in my lifetime. We will be talking about this dinner for some time and will definitely return on our next visit to Montreal!"}
{"text":"From the same group that own club chasses peches and le filet and my favorite out of the 3.it is in a beautiful industrial art gallery building in the oldport.even though there are no windows there is a lot of sunlight and a good ambiance.my favorite items on the menu are the crudo appetizer and the lobster risotto.the service is professional and the wine is great.this is a good place to go after work during the week and to celebrate on the weekend."}
{"text":"Bel endroit avec une déco interessante! Éclairage parfait avec une belle ambiance. Les plats excellents, mais les portions légèrement petites"}
{"text":"From first impressions the restaurant feels like a garage , very little decorations and whop la , I respect the fact that they stand on their creative mixture of Italian n French cuisine . The staff very friendly and courteous, the food  amazing combinations.!!! Please look pics , everything tastes amazing great place to eat n go out afterwards...."}
{"text":"Favorite meal in Montreal hands down. The service, cocktails, food and ambiance were so special! 

I can't remember the last time I ordered roast chicken as my entree, but it is a MUST at Le Serpent. I've never had better chicken in my life!

Definitely order the bread on request for the table!! It was similar to focaccia and so tasty. 

We spent about $50/person and so well worth it."}
{"text":"Le Serpent is one of those places that perfectly balances ambiance, food quality, service, and \"hip\" factor. The speck linguini has to be one of the best pasta dishes I've had in the city. I shared a half portion with a friend, but will most certainly get the full plate next time."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant. Les aliments sont de très bonne qualité. La viande à la broche et les pâtes sont excellents. Le service est accueillant et chaleureux. Nous avons été servis rapidement. Ma note de 3 étoiles se reflète plus sur les aspects suivants : bruyant (nous ne pouvions pas parler sans crier) et très cher pour ce que nous avions dans l'assiette (en moyenne 30$ pour un plat principal et 10$ pour un dessert). J'y retournerais certainement mais pas régulièrement."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their burrata-carpaccio appetizer. Highlight of meal to me. Also ordered their pork jowl but mainly out of curiosity. Seemed well executed but, as it turns out, not my thing. One potentially informative critique: I felt that, aside from the cipollini onions, the side elements weren't ideal complements to the main ingredient. Finished with the lemon dessert. It was a nice way to end things and not too heavy.

My colleagues liked the wine they tried but I couldn't partake (work call just after dinner for some reason...).

Staff was competent and reliable but not particularly warm. So not additive but, more fundamentally, not subtractive in any way either. Not the kind of place where you'll get to know the staff after several visits - but, in most settings, that's perfectly fine for sure."}
{"text":"Very swanky spot serving great food, with the prices to match. It's hidden in what looks like an industrial building from the outside, but on the inside it's a very warehouse-chic.

To be honest, I wouldn't come here on my own unless it was for a special occasion, but I was brought here by a colleague. She was treating, which always makes me kind of wary of ordering too much or anything expensive, so I didn't eat a whole lot as a result. But what I did have was excellent. We ordered a really nice wine, shared some oysters (they really know their oysters!), and I had a pasta dish.

This place is an interesting concept because their dishes are kind of fusion - East meets West with heavy emphasis on the West. Or maybe it's better put to say it's Italianish with some Asian influences. But the structure of the menu is Italian for sure - there are first course pasta dishes (you can get a larger size if you're only having pasta), and then meat dishes. I had a first course-sized pasta, which was not enough because I'm a big eater but again, a colleague was treating. It was al dente, deliciously flavoured, and beautifully presented.

This is the kind of place you might take a date if you really want to impress them!"}
{"text":"This place is solid! The service was good, the menu was diverse and very interesting, the decor is nice. We went with a group of ten and everybody loved their food!!! My boyfriend is a vegetarian and his food was perfect!! He normally always finds something wrong and he didn't. I had the lobster lasagna omg omg omg it was perfect ."}
