{"text":"Doughnuts was good and fresh . And LOVE there boba smoothies, Never had a boba drink before but it was very good and I will try all the flavors next time I'm around there . Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Soft fluffy delicious donuts, comparable to Bosa donuts, but better. Would recommend if you're looking for a good donut place."}
{"text":"Excellent donuts and friendly service. 
Buttermilk donuts are my favorite. 
All their donuts are fresh and better quality than donut chain stores/grocery."}
{"text":"Great donuts, good prices. They taste fresh. I took my family for grand opening and we each got a free donut!"}
{"text":"Best donuts I've ever tried. Even better than Krispy Kreme. By the way, the employees are super friendly. Wonderful customer service! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"If you want fresh amazing, tasty Donuts  at a great price with staff that is actually kind and happy to have your business; then Donut Worry is where you need to go!! The Donuts are always fresh and the staff is always happy and helpful! The glazed donut holes are too die for,  so are the cinnamon rolls,  apple fritters, maple bars, ham and cheese crossants, breakfast sandwiches, regular sandwiches, smoothies.....basically everything is fabulous! Do yourself a favor and check this place out!"}
{"text":"Best donuts I've had. The staff were very friendly, it was clean inside and the donuts are pretty cheap. They were very soft and fresh. Great place for donut lovers."}
{"text":"Best donuts I have had in a long time! Great service friendly and they take special requests! If they don't have a doughnut you're looking for just ask they may be able to make it up right there for you!"}
{"text":"Been there twice for the vanilla cream glazed donuts.  Delicious."}
{"text":"Best apple fritters... ever...

Went in a couple days after they opened.  My wife picked up some of my favorites.  We live nearby and like to support local, small business.  

Loved the donuts and will be back in soon.

Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Best donuts around! Better than Bosa Donuts. The cake is delicious and not overly sweet, and the icings aren't grainy or goopy. The iced coffee and breakfast sandwiches are also well-made. My husband really like his egg and bacon croissant sandwich. 

Great atmosphere, clean, friendly staff. This is the only donut place I like in the valley."}
{"text":"While visiting from Utah we had a craving for donuts & breakfast sandwiches. We found the perfect spot! Donut Worry is a great family owned shop. Everything is made fresh daily and the prices are very good. We had donuts, breakfast sandwiches, a smoothie & 5 dozen donut holes. It was all YUMMY! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went to this donut shop that just opened yesterday, and I was not disappointed!  The donuts are very fresh and delicious.  I got an apple fritter, that had just the right amount of crunch on the outside, and was tender on the inside with just the right amount of sweet apple filling.  I also tried a maple long john, which was real fresh and tender.  I love donuts, and these are some of the best I've had.  Can't wait to try some different ones.  They also have boba and smoothies and Thai iced tea."}
{"text":"So I just order apple fritters and a cinnamon roll. WOW. They taste heavenly.

For a price of $3 , for both donuts and a medium coffee, you'll be crazy not to go there lol. I found my new coffee place.

I'm actually in the car as I'm typing this out, eating the donuts."}
{"text":"So, my usual routine is going to Dunkin Donuts every morning for coffee. Today when I went by there the line for the drive-thru was so long I just didn't want to deal. I drove around the block and had planned to go into Starbucks at Safeway but saw this little place and decided to give it a chance. I ordered a large iced caramel coffee and a buttermilk donut. The donut was fabulous! It was crunchy on the outside and gooey/moisty in the middle, just like it should be. The coffee I would say is average, but it's good. The man behind the register was VERY nice and made sure I knew about all the deals they have going right now and how long they would last. I would most definitely recommend trying this little gem. The ONLY reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I feel like maybe the coffee could be a little better. As I said, it's good, just not super memorable. The donut though? Amazing. I will be recommending to friends!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were out for an early evening motorcycle ride when it started lightly raining. We happened to see the sign for Donut Worry which we had read about on YELP. So why not reward ourselves and try out a new donut shop. The folks who greeted us were very friendly. At 6:30 in the evening not much business which makes some sense as coffee time was a bit passed. Anyway, to the important part. We picked up an apple fritter, cinnamon roll and a vanilla filled Bismarck to try out. We took them home cut them up (so we could try a bit of everything) and sampled. A bit late for coffee so milk was the drink of choice. The apple fritter and cinnamon roll were both excellent. The vanilla filled Bismarck needed coffee. It just wasn't right with the milk. Next time we will pick up early morning and have at coffee time. Already have my sight set on there cinnamon twist as my next taste test. Have a Great Day!!"}
{"text":"Keep it going, guys.  I wake up EARLY.  Whenever I want to be bad and forego my usually healty....I come here about 5am and indulge myself in a large coffee and a couple of donuts to go home with and savor.  All pleasure and skip the guilt!!   FRESH. FRESH. FRESH.  The owner ( I can tell I think from his pic here on Yelp)  is in the back always and concentrating on his craft.  I love the chocolate and blueberry cake and the glazed is better than a Krispy Kream.  Coffee always fresh and strong too.  PLUS....in this age of LOUSY CUSTOMER SERVICE...the sweet, nice women he has at the front could not provide any better service.  A+ for bakery and staff.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"SERIOUSLY THE BEST DONUTS in the world! I felt like I was bitting into a cloud! Get the glaze donut! Great customer service. The owner was very friendly."}
{"text":"So good! Today was my first time going their and the woman at the counter was so helpful and nice!"}
{"text":"Yum! Pretty new little donut shop in Mesa, and they were gold. Tons and tons of different flavors & all at a very fair price. They have smoothies and sandwiches too and the staff was friendly! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Best donuts in the east valley! Great customer service and everything is fresh! I would recommend this place to anyone in the Arizona area."}
{"text":"Here for the grand opening! Everyone is so friendly and welcoming. The donuts are fresh."}
{"text":"One of the best Donut shops. They always have a great selection of donuts even when they are busy. Their smoothies are amazing, so many flavors to choice from. The pricing is normal and the staff is nice."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and everyone is always so friendly. The donuts are AMAZING! The iced coffee is very sweet, similar to DD on the sweet level. This time I ordered a hot medium coffee and a donut. Came out less than three dollars. Great pricing and great quality. I'd highly recommend the pumpkin glaze donut! So amazing!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I love Bosa, but these donuts are x10s better!! They are so light and fluffy!! The raspberry jelly donut was the best I ever had! It actually tasted like raspberries and not cough syrup! Seriously, next time you wanna get donuts, SKIP BOSA and go to this place!"}
{"text":"Great place Great owner. Newsflash America the cost to do business goes up everyday. Labor and Materials does not stay static deal with it. The price is still fair and the product is excellent. If you are not savvy enough to search for their coupons that is on you. He takes competitors coupons and has plenty of his own."}
{"text":"Fresh and wonderful! Fat worthy! If you're going to be bad Donut worry has it covered! 

Warm and Soft! Friendly staff! And definitely try their ham n cheese!

We made a pit stop because we were craving for some donuts and the last thing we want is old and tasteless donuts but donut worry saved our day! We also tried the coconut boba for the first time here. Can't explain the flavor but I know I will have trouble craving their coconut boba as I live in California. Mmmmmm! 

Cravings Satisfied!"}
{"text":"AWESOME DONUTS!!  
We've always been big fans of Krispy Kreme, but every donut we tried at Donut Worry was surprisingly BETTER!  Unlike Krispy Kreme, the glazed donuts (as well as ALL of them) at Donut Worry are amazing even when they're not warm.  It's almost like you're eating personalized little gourmet cakes with amazing flavor and texture in every bite!
Personal favorites were the buttermilk, blueberry cake, and apple fritter donuts. 
But seriously, everything was delicious!
The owner, Sam, was friendly and fun. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Special ordered cream filled long johns today....and they were every bit as delicious as my favorite long johns from Golden Brown bakery in St Joseph, MI....
You guys should think about adding them to the permanent menu....
And...best sprinkle cakes donuts, maybe, in America...glad i found you....keep up the great work...
Plus...staff is wonderful..."}
{"text":"A measure of a good business isn't always what they do right, it's how they react when something doesn't go right.  Donut Worry excels at customer service!  We ordered some specialty donuts for a special event and scheduled them to be picked up very early.  They had an incident beyond their control and were unable to make the speciality donuts.  They tried to call me but I was already on my way.  They gave us any donut I wanted free of charge to make up for it- 4 dozen!  And they were delicious!  The only thing special about what I ordered was the shapes, so it didn't ruin anything for us! They more than made up for the minor inconvenience and We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The staff members I just met must be the most genuinely kind people I've met in a while. It wasn't that fake/annoying customer service you get at most places. The store was very clean and smelled delicious. I got an Irish cream iced coffee and a buttermilk cruller. The selection of donuts was overwhelming, but my eyes rested on that cruller and I'm glad I got it. So yummy. The coffee is very good too. I'll be going back to work from lunch very happy. I donut worry anymore!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST donut shop we have tried in Gilbert 
The donuts are always fresh.  They also carry croissant breakfast sandwiches that are so flaky and warm.  I love the ham, cheese and jalapeño!
Donuts are light and fluffy.
Bonus:  the servers are very friendly."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this spot since they've first open the doors. Lots of fresh donuts throughout most of the day with a great selection to choose from. The cake donuts aren't too greasy which is a instant win in my book.

Also this is one of the only places in the area I can get my Thai Iced Tea fix. They also have a large variety of boba drinks.

Friendly staff is also a plus here!

Get here early on Saturday's if you want to get your hands on some Malasadas."}
{"text":"There is a relationship somehow to Bosa. Menu is the same but I think the doughnuts are a little better here. Always friendly, cheerful service. I'm not positive but the few times I ordered donut holes there had to have been more than 12 in a dozen."}
{"text":"Love them!!!  We are always welcomed with a smiling face. The staff is always sweet and helpful. We all love the donuts and I will go out of my way to get a croissant sandwich or pick up donuts for my class. We can get donuts on Sunday and they are still fabulously on Tuesday morning. Nothing like fresh donuts!!"}
{"text":"Simply the best donuts in town. So fresh and fluffy an amazing light in texture. Definitely recommended"}
{"text":"While visiting Arizona I came here with my husband and baby today for lunch. We had a tuna croissant sandwich, turkey croissant sandwich, taro smoothie, honeydew smoothie and blueberry donuts. Everything was amazing! The food tasted fresh and the service was impressive. Clean, friendly environment! I highly recommend this donut shop. It has so much options. The best blueberry donuts I've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Manager welcomed us in and took the time to go over the menu with us. After we made our donut choices and sat down to eat, he checked in with us to make sure everything was to our liking. As we were leaving he even refilled our coffee. He loves his job and his attitude is infectious. Clean, fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Super soft donuts!! Came in here to get my daughter a chocolate bar and I had to get one as well as their machine doesn't accept any purchases of less than a dollar when using a card. I got the Boston cream donut and it was soft and delicious!!!! Fresh and tasted amazing!! -1 star for making me wait and not greeting me."}
{"text":"Yelp told me this place opened recently, so we went to check it out. Owned by Bosa Donuts and much of the same selection but their staff definitely puts it over the top. The man at the counter was extremely friendly and made it a point to address my four year old as the man in charge and patiently let him choose between all the options. He was proud of the restaurant and gave us all of the promotional offers and ensured we would come back soon. Not something you often get at a donut shop and definitely refreshing. Happy to take my business somewhere where they actually care about what they are doing! Donuts were delicious- just like everyone else says, their apple fritters are the best!"}
{"text":"Great food and coffee. Very friendly staff. Nice place to stop for just a light breakfast. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite donut place! Close to work and you can even call ahead. They make croissants in house and the donuts. The owner is friendly and is there pretty often. I'm surprise they are not always busy!! They have coffee breakfast sandwiches lunch and they're local! Spread the word"}
{"text":"I've been hooked on the awesome donuts from Donut Worry ever since I first tried them a few months ago. I bought them to take to my office and now my co-workers regularly request them. Great donuts and great customer service every time I go in."}
{"text":"I visited this location after seeing all the great reviews on yelp and i gotta tell you I was not disappointed. I order two donuts one devil food and other cinnamon roll and they were both absolutely delicious! Friendly staff and very clean establishment."}
{"text":"We love it!!! Especially my Son. There location on Baseline Road in Mesa is awesome as well."}
{"text":"Amazing!   Every single donut is sheer perfection!   They have malsadas that are delightful, Boston cream donuts are to die for, fritters are crisp on the outside and have plenty of fruit - all types are delicious!    

Counter help is always professional and pleasant :)"}
{"text":"The donut holes are the best!!!!! And ham and cheese croissant!!!! And Thai iced tea with boba!!!!!! You know what's even better than the food and beverages? The service!!!!! What a great staff!!!! Can't wait to visit again!!!!"}
{"text":"I normally go to bosa donuts every Sunday but this morning on this beautiful Sunday I decided to try this new place that opened up near me, donut worry. I walked in and it wasn't as busy as I would think it would be on a Sunday morning, but based on all the other reviews for their business I new it must be good! I ordered a chocolate sprinkle donut and a chocolate bar donut with their watermelon smoothie. The donuts were delicious, they tasted very similar to Bosa. The customer services was amazing and they were also very quick. The watermelon smoothie was okay, they put either milk or cream in it so it wasn't the best smoothie I've had but it wasn't the worse either. Definitely a must try for anyone who hasn't tried it"}
{"text":"WORST DONUTS EVER. Me and my husband went for early morning donuts and we were left very disappointed. Staff touching hair and eating donuts in the back. Very unprofessional. Won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Awesome bakery goods!
You must check it out.
Love the thai tea !
Always come back for more!"}
{"text":"I really like the Apple fritters there really amazing you're super Yum me. And I love that your next-door to panda express"}

{"text":"My wife and I have been here twice and LOVE EVERY BITE of everything! We will be regulars now and 4-ever! OMG it is so GOOD!"}
{"text":"We got your basic doughnuts; sprinkles, old fashioned, buttermilk. They were all delicious!!!  We will definitely be going back. The employees were all very nice as well!  Can't wait to try more here!"}
{"text":"Just moved into the area and it was our first time visiting this shop. They are friendly and eager to please! And the donuts are amazing!! We will definitley be coming here for our sweets from now on."}
{"text":"Best donuts in Arizona! The owners are the friendliest, hardest working, most genuine people. Them as well as the employees care about the product and your experience. You have to check them out!"}
{"text":"Good quality fresh donuts!!  Keep on doing what you're doing and don't change the price and you'll do fine. Your donuts are very good and addictive. You can't have just one!  :)"}
{"text":"Seriously THE best vanilla cream filled donuts! My mother in law from Tucson has to stop here each visit. We have yet to try a donut we don't love. The staff is so friendly and welcoming and ya just can't beat the prices!"}
{"text":"Great service. Delicious donuts! Only negative is they use processed Swiss cheese and not the real stuff."}
{"text":"Really yummy donuts! Great prices as well. I also had a breakfast sandwich and it was delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent donuts at a good price.  Donuts always fresh and delicious, with a huge selection!"}
{"text":"These are bosa donuts enough said they are the best in town. DD for coffee but skip their donuts. So many flavors and varieties that it makes it hard to choose they also serve breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"Donuts were descent, the coffee was stale and the smoothie started to separate. I suppose I was expecting something different."}
{"text":"Delicious donuts and clean restaurant.  Very fresh.  The smoothies are insanely good."}
{"text":"By far the best donut shop I have been too. Really good service and it's nice and clean and of course there donuts are  fire definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"Sunday mornings they offer Malasadas. If u have not tried one.....u need to. I get mine filled with custard, but they also offer them with vanilla filling and plain. Have not had them since I was in Hawaii and was excited when I found out you could get them here!!"}
{"text":"Donuts always are fresh no matter the time of day
Good product
Owner is frequently on cite promoting his business in a nice manner"}
{"text":"Fun and friendly!!! Loved going in to see Santa and eat doughnuts. Happy kids = happy mama."}
{"text":"As a fat guy I consider myself to be a doughnut expert. These are amazing doughnuts! Made in house from scratch they are perfect.  Not overly sweet they yield to the bite perfectly. The muffins are tasty and the slight crunch of the muffin tops makes me very happy! 
The coffee is hot and strong enough to wake up properly.  They also have smoothies and boba tea. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Went here on the way to my grandson football practice this morning. Very impressed donuts were so fresh and very good, service was good as well.  I will definitely be returning!! Good selection as well."}
{"text":"CRAZY GOOD !
Best internet connection at 22.6 mgbs around. 
The owner has set the price at .89 cents for any donut! I am a huge donut/pastry eater and was so impressed beyond my normal expectations. 
  ITS A MUST IF YOU LOVE DONUTS"}
{"text":"Every once in awhile you run into a small business where the owner is a true \"artist\" in their wares.  This is one of those places. The donuts are seriously world class & I'm originally from Detroit where there is a donut shop on every corner (so i know donuts). They always have a new item they are testing out and tweaking to perfection. Today, they were testing Portugese Malasadas and they brought a hot one out for me to test. Just go check 'em out. I guarantee you'll go back again and again."}
{"text":"I did like this place but then came in today to et what I always get at this time and all of a sudden they won't do it. When there menu says served all day. Apparently you can't trust there menu or workers anymore. All I know is I Won't be coming back here"}
{"text":"We tried a dozen donuts and some donut holes, great donuts!!  The plain glaze is one of the best I've ever had.  The glazed vanilla filled was also very good.  Apple fritter was great.   Really they were all good.  Donut holes are like the glazed, worth it!   Btw, they are $9.99 a dozen."}
{"text":"Very good donuts, always fresh!  Very nice staff, always friendly! This location has a drive through too, which is always nice!  Definitely worth a try if you are in the area!  

5 star donuts for sure!"}
{"text":"Donuts are amazing!  This spot makes good donuts.  Had the buttermilk and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Great place,great doughnuts! And love that its close to my house.definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, we got there when they just opened and they didn't have everything out so the gal behind the counter said they if we didn't see it she could get it for us. The cake donuts are amazing. So all in all they are great friendly, clean and I will be back again."}
{"text":"I found this place a few weeks ago (thanks to Yelp) and after having a nice conversation with the owner, I ordered a dozen donuts and two cappuccinos. 

The donuts were excellent! Especially the cake donuts and the apple fritters. Best donuts I have had in a long time!

I was a little disappointed to see the cappuccinos coming from a machine but I must say, that is the best coffee product I've ever had from a machine and I've tried lots of them over the years.

The owner and his staff are very friendly and I like how clean it is inside. There is ample parking and the price is about average for donuts of this quality ($10.50 a dozen with tax).

I went in several times after that first visit and haven't been disappointed yet. Between this place and Soda Rush across the street, East Mesa has a nice little section of sweets stores!"}
{"text":"This place is the best donut shop ever! It's small business owned, great customer service and the most delicious donuts I've ever had. If you're in the East Valley I highly recommend this shop for all your donut needs. Mmmmmmm....fabulous!"}
{"text":"The Thai tea was the best ever! The guy working the front counter was incredibly friendly as well. Very clean establishment. All of the baked goods looked tempting and delicious. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Donut holes and buttermilk donut is all we got and they were delicious. Store is very clean. Reminded me of a Bosa but it was yummy."}
{"text":"Really great donuts. Highly recommend. Awesome service."}
{"text":"Exploring Yelp in anticipation of a Saturday morning craving for donuts, Donut Worry's 5 star rating immediately caught my attention. The store was very easy to find for this East Valley newcomer. I immediately noticed the bright and clean, inviting environment. Then I noticed the donuts. And fritters (regular and monster!). And more donuts. And decadent goodies. My day was complete by oh-620!  Friendly service, reasonable prices, and incredibly tasty donuts. And fritters. And cinnamon twists.  Oh yeah, I'll be back. Maybe bring a  box of power rings  to my cardiologist. Well deserved 5 stars for Donut Worry."}
{"text":"Delicious donuts and great customer service! They gave my kids a basket of free donut holes :)"}
{"text":"AHHH I FOUD THAI ICED TEA BY MY HOUSE!!! I JUST CANNOT CONTAIN THE EXCITEMENT!!! Also the dounts are very good, in general I only eat Krispy Kreme donuts or that ridiculously delicious canned biscuit donut from Okra, BUT these are absolutely fantastic!! They have both cake and raised (my favorite), I used the Yelp Check In deal to have a Raspberry filled donut and it was great!! Perfect balance of tart and sweet!  They also have menu items that are not donuts! The staff has all been really friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Very delicious, but very similar to Bosa donuts! (Which is also delicious, so its ok!)"}
{"text":"I saw this place open up next to Safeway/ panda and wanted to check it out.  Given I have a newborn and a toddler it hasn't worked out for me to go.  Well last week my husband ran into the grocery store to grab a few items while I sat in the car with the kids-when they both started crying and would not quit.  At my wits end, I got them out of the car to feed the baby and give the toddler a change of scenery.  We popped into the donut store and found a piece of heaven! My husband joined us soon after and we ended up taking a half dozen home.  The glazed vanilla were to die for, the cinnamon apple buttercream were delicious and even the plain glazed were yummy. My husband picked up a boba tea which he thought was really good too. 
These are the kind of donuts you crave, the kind you'll go out of your way to get, the ones that are still good at 6 pm at night.  I know because we got some more last night!  The only problem I see is they don't have a drive thru  (which would be a real problem to my pp weight loss haha). 
Seriously good donuts. Try the vanilla filled, just make sure to save one for me"}
{"text":"This donut shop is by far the best donuts I have had in a very long time.  Perfect glaze, cream,  and batter. My husband and I are frequent flyers and will continue to come back for some more delicious donuts!"}
