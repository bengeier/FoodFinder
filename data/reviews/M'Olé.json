{"text":"This is a great lunch spot for the downtown office crowd.  It's tucked into the southwest corner of the 101 building. The concept for the space is that it's going to have 2 additional counter-order restaurants and then open seating for all three restaurants.  With respect to M'ole, the menu is not extensive, but they do a really solid job. I love the 3 for $10 lunch menu, which allows you to puck any three menu items, so you can mix and match tacos, sides and dessert, or all tacos, etc. The tacos are simple, but delicious.  I've had the carne asada and the chicken. My friends rave about the vegetarian, which is essentially a chile rellano in a tortilla. The salsas have just enough kick for me (a mild-medium spice person), without overwhelming the tacos themselves. I love that the street corn comes in a bowl and is already cut off of the cob so that you don't have to struggle with that in your work clothes.  The fried plantains  with vanilla ice cream are delicious, and the perfect way to end the meal. My understanding is that they're still in a \"soft open\" phase, so the staff seems pretty limited, but the food has come out quickly all three times I've been in. I really hope they succeed. The food is good and the lunch deal is hard to beat."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I eat here twice a week. He makes his own corn tortillas and they are uniquely delicious.  Pick three for 10 is a great deal. I normaly do not go for anything vegetarian but his veggie taco is totally legit. Also try his elote (Mexican corn)."}
{"text":"It hits the spot every time! Tortillas hechas a mano (hand made tortillas)...yes please."}
{"text":"Liked the veggie taco - innovative.  The rice was a cut above the usual dry Spanish rice. Bananas on top, to my surprise, worked quite well.  The salad was not over-dressed and had nice soft cheese and walnuts. Kudos also for the quick service and recyclable to-go containers."}
{"text":"Yum!  While not a ton of options- the tacos were super yummy ,  fresh and homemade.  I had the chicken taco with mole and veggie with a whole rellano chili.  Corn side was crispy and flavorful.  Will go back and am excited to try the other restaurant options in the same space."}
{"text":"I stopped in a little over a week ago to pick-up a quick lunch for my husband and I.  I had been curious about this place since it is across the street from where I live, but the hours are limited to Monday - Friday during the day only.  We ended up with 2 beef tacos, a chicken taco, street corn, red rice and rice pudding - everything was absolutely delicious...especially the beef tacos, corn and rice.  We'll definitely be back for simple, but tasty food as a very reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Don't walk by and not try this spot out! Just ate here the other day. Tried a few different dishes. The tortillas are hand made on site. There's 3 different taco choices of chicken, beef, and chili relleno. There's 4 different hot sauces that vary in spiciness. The street corn is also super legit! Also the churros with ice cream is a must dish to wash it all down. Will make sure I eat here again on my next trip to downtown Phoenix.  Recommendation: Tacos, street corn, and churros"}
{"text":"The corn tortillas were good. I found the chicken and beef bland. Very simple with only little radish and cilantro. The sauces were also bland and generic. Spice it up and be more than normal!"}
{"text":"Only open a few weeks, so maybe it will get better, but my first try for lunch here was quite underwhelming. The beef street tacos were average at best. The street corn, even though it has an ear of corn shown on the menu, was a bowl of canned corn with some chili powder and cojita cheese sprinkled on top. The rice pudding tasted and looked suspiciously like the rice pudding at Costco. Hopefully things improve, but right now, definitely well below average for a downtown Phoenix lunch."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. I was wandering aimlessly around my office building trying to find something that appealed to me for lunch. I remember my SIL mentioned she has been here before for their soft opening. There is no signage and although I work across the street, I have never seen an indication that a restaurant actually exists in this location. I almost walked right by it. For clarification, it is on the NE corner of Adams and 1st ave, next to Spoonz cafe.   The interior is confusing. Looks like a big, undecorated restaurant. They take orders at a counter but there is no menu up on a wall, just paper menus.  The menu is refreshingly simple. Mix and match 3 items for $10. They have 3 different types of tacos, rice, guac and chips, salad, street corn, and desserts. I really wanted to try 2 sides plus dessert in addition to my taco so I was pleased to hear you can also do 4 for $12.  I had the chili relleno taco, rice, street corn, and churro. I was at first disappointed that the relleno wasn't battered and fried but it was very tasty. Filled with a zesty mix of veggies and tofu and topped with cheese. It was a welcome unique choice for vegetarians, such as myself. It was small though but luckily the side dishes are generous portions and will fill you up.  Street corn was yummy. I prefer my corn off the cob and was happy that it was. The rice was good but nothing special. I added some of their zippy salsa which really elevated the taste. The churro was OMG good. They were mini churros served with vanilla ice cream. (Also a warning for people who get it to-go... I have a tendency to put my dessert aside for later. Glad I checked it when I got back to my office otherwise it would have been vanilla soup!)  Overall, great experience. I wish they offered beans. I know the menu is simple but beans are a Mexican staple and I really missed them with my meal. I would also recommend getting some signage and sprucing the place up inside. It has great potential and the food is 10x better than any nearby Mexican place."}
{"text":"Work downtown so any new establishment is a plus. Found this little gem on way to another spot. Gave it a shot. We have been back about 10x now. Pick 3 items from menu for $10. Chicken or steak tacos on corn tort. He touches it off with signature shaved radish and a nice green sauce. Also offers elotes in a bowl, churros, fried plantains and a chile relleno served in a corn tortilla they push it as a \"vegetarian taco\". Also red rice, chips and guac and house salad. Any of the above are 3 for $10. Easy to miss as there aren't signs up besides in the window.  Just a few spots down from yasda bento (rice bowl place). Worth a try. Soon it will be a part of a trio of restaurants. Waiting on the other 2 guys to set up shop."}
{"text":"Downtown Phoenix location: I have NO IDEA how this place has 4 stars. You get 3 items for $10, so I chose a chicken taco, a steak taco and paired it with the corn.  Chicken taco: The brown sauce used in it tasted burned and what little of the chicken that was on it had zero flavor, could have been boiled as far as I could tell with thin slices of radish and a little Mexican cheese.  Steak taco: At least this one had some guacamole and cilantro on it to add some flavor, but again there was very little meat and what meat there was had zero flavor to it.   Corn: I was pretty excited for the corn (I love the street corn vendors) and was SO DISAPPOINTED with this corn. It had very little cheese and the powder seemed to be chili powder and not the kind used by the street vendors.    I must say the tortillas are very good, must be homemade. But they need to change the filling.  For $10, I will never visit this establishment again, nor will I suggest it to anyone."}
{"text":"Mexican food with a Cuban twist! Exciting to your taste buds. Looking forward to them getting the shrimp tacos! You must try the red rice with bananas, it was very yummy! I also had the guacamole and chicken taco. Influenced by his grandmothers Cuban background, Michael is the owner and he exhibits excellent customer service. I will definitely be returning with some work colleagues in the near future."}
{"text":"Best Mexican spot I've been to downtown. Really enjoyed my meal. I had a chicken taco, steak taco, and bowl of elote for $10.  Everything was excellent and I'll definitely be coming back. The staff is friendly and the service was fast. I ordered and had my food within a few minutes."}
