{"text":"The food is really good here. I have been to this place a couple of times, and usually the service varies. If you go during the evening there are a couple of nice and friendly ladies serving you. But on another hand, during the day, especially lunch time, the service is really poor and the staff is usually not friendly enough.  When you go to a restaurant, you're not only looking for good food, remember you want the whole experience; meaning good service as well!"}
{"text":"The food here was good and with generous portions. I had the souvlaki while my friend went with the salmon. The service on the other hand was poor. We were the only people sitting in the bar area and our server was the bartender. Even though we were in her direct line of sight, we had to wait more than ten minutes respectively to order our food and get our check.  The final insult was when the server separated our bills without being asked to, which was bizarre. It was like she presumed that I couldn't possibly be out with such a beautiful woman unless it was a platonic situation."}
{"text":"Well maybe it was a nice place before,  but looks very old now. Seats ripped,  tables chipped.  Food took forever. ..and wasn't hot...restaurant was empty. ..wondering what server was doing? !"}
{"text":"J'ai mangé ici un sandwich smoke-meat à la suite d'un après-midi de magasinage par temps froid sur Ste-Cath. Déception : La viande fumée du sandwich ne goutait à peu près rien. Du buf en tranche, c'est tout. Aucune saveur de fumée ou d'épice. J'accorde une étoile pour la portion gigantesque et une autre pour le service souriant et courtois de notre serveuse. C'est tout. Pour le reste, c'est un resto à oublier. Et je passe sous silence l'aspect délabré des banquettes.    Au final, j'ai entendu dire que cette place était sur le point de fermer pour passer le flambeau à une autre bannière de restauration rapide. Puisque tous les restos Nickels sont à peu près les mêmes, cette critiques s'adresse aussi à n'importe quel autre franchise de ce type."}
{"text":"I should remember to check the reviews first! I am not sure why this place has so many customers eating here, because it certainly does not deserve the clientele! I had a chicken club with Cesar salad. I  asked for Cesar salad and got fries, sent it back once and the salad was pre-made and soggy, with some fries underneath. The toasted bread was soft as it appeared to be pre-made, the tomatoes were old and dried out, the lettuce wilted and one piece of over cooked bacon crumbled and spread over the sandwich. The chicken breast was a thinly sliced piece of a chicken breast that barely made it through the entire sandwich. Needless to say not a good sandwich. Thank goodness the soup was ok, or I would have to find another place to eat! The service was short and abrupt. If you are looking for a Denny's style of restaurant, this place would qualify!"}
{"text":"My cousin and I stopped in on our way to a concert for a quick bite and boy were we disappointed. We boht got fish and chips which tasted frozen and bland. Our servers were terrible and rude. Homeless people kept walking through the restaurant. The bathrooms smelled and looked terrible. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"I don't know if Nickels was ever popular, but boy do they suck now. I've tried their St Catherine location which really is disappointing and this Atwater one isn't any better.  I figured it would be a good place to grab a quick bite before watching a movie at the Forum theater since it's right next to it, but this place falls short. I should have paid attention to the warning signs. It is badly situated in the mall, very little foot traffic around so the place was dead even though it was a supper time on a Thursday.  Everything looks outdated, and unappealing. Crossover between a family style chain and diner.  Menu has quite a fair amount of choices, I settled on a fish filet which came with rice and steamed vegetables. Fish was overcooked, burnt and crispy on some sides. Rice and veggies were fine.  The worse part was the service. We were seated towards the back of the restaurant, right next to their kitchen and could continuously hear staff talking and laughing or yelling at each other. Yet our waitress never came to check up on us. When we wanted to leave, we had to go practically behind the kitchen and ask for another girl to get our waitress for the bill.  There's just not enough people dining at this restaurant, you can tell the staff doesn't care and the odd customer or two isn't enough to draw their attention.  I predict it will close very soon unless Place Alexis Nihon mall reinvents itself and brings in a whole new crowd of people."}
{"text":"Not my first choice, but, despite all the negative reviews, these guys give you a very hearty breakfast (they must have a potato farm in the kitchen or something). The service is average, but courteous. The food is a bit greasy, and it has that 'diner (it's too cold outside)' type feeling. We missed the early breakfast prices, but it was still quite cheap less than $30 for two people. One can get away with less, but we ordered a lot of bacon (be careful, a single portion is pretty large). Not too shabby!"}
{"text":"Not sure why I ate here??? But it was desperate times! I had the grilled chicken Caesars salad. Which was just OK. place was busy!!"}
