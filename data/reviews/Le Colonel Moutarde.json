{"text":"I love board games, I love good food, and I love pubs that combine both. I've been a regular at Randolph Pub for a while, and I kept meaning to try Colonel Moutarde, but somehow never got around to it until this month.

First, the good: The curry pizza was just delicious. OMG so worth it just for that! Also, the selection of board games is pretty decent, and the beer selection isn't bad. 

Now, the not-so-good: The red shirts (i.e. the staff who are there specifically to give game advice) don't seem to know the games very well. Maybe I'm being unfair comparing them to the Randolph game staff, who know every game inside out and backwards. But here, they didn't bother to make recommendations, and when we asked them for instructions on a few games, they admitted they didn't know them and left it to us to read the instructions ourselves. Which we could've stayed home to do, to be fair, rather than paying the cover charge to come to a gaming pub. 

Also, the pub is pricey. And they only have a food-with-alcohol license, so they require you to order food if you want a beer -- which they only tell you AFTER you've ordered. I wanted food anyway so I didn't care, but a few people I was with had just stopped in after dinner for drinks and games. Since they also charge a cover, it adds up quickly. 

And finally, half the pub is very dark and the lighting is insufficient to see the games. We kept having to use the flashlights on our phones to see what we were doing. Not a great setup for games.

I wanted to like you more than this, Colonel Moutarde. And since you're close to home and your pizza is delicious, I'll probably be back. But I have to say I think Randolph does it better."}
{"text":"Fun place to go for a drink and play games. 
At first I was a little skeptical of their menu when I saw the list of drinks - it's clearly intended to be 'different', and might even stray into 'forced quirkiness' territory. That being said, you can't argue with good mixing and good flavors. The signature menu is just smartly crafted and competently made. I tasted a gin and tonic )they make their own tonic with cedar, it's nice) and a drink called \"l'herbal\"- very refreshing and light without being either flavorless or sugar-sweet. 
The food menu is similar to the drinks. Unusual flavor combinations (chili bourguignon?) odd ingredients like crushed doritos etc. The doritos especially made me roll my eyes, because their prices are well above doritos level. But then the food comes out, and there's just no arguing with the flavor. I tasted the chili with naan chips(really tasty if maybe a little short on actual meat) and some of the mac and cheese. Both had really good flavors in a moderate serving size (I felt full but not stuffed). 
As for the games, there is a staff of hosts/hostesses who are only responsible for bringing them out, explaining rules etc. and I was very pleased with their service. I could tell that the girl I dealt with was more comfortable in French than English, but she was very accommodating and explained the rules of the game I played very clearly and patiently. 
One minor complaint- when I came in (in a party of 2) I was immediately directed to a hightop table without much room for spreading out a game to play. I understand that it was busy, and the bigger tables would be needed for larger parties, but I did feel cramped at the little table I got, and I didn't have any choice in the matter really. Not a huge complaint, just rubbed me the wrong way a little bit. 
All in all, I had a really nice time. I had a tasty dinner, a well-made drink, and I got to try a board game that I'd been hemming and hawing about actually paying for. (Machi Koro- definitely getting it now. It was a lot of fun). A few little gripes, but it doesn't change the fact that it was a good night. Underneath the hipster facade there's a really good bar here. 

Anglophones take note- I didn't get a detailed look, but I have the impression that there's a good deal more games in French than in English. They definitely have both, but the balance is a little skewed towards French."}
{"text":"Perfect place to hang with friends while playing board games all night. They have a large collection of games, ranging from very bobo to hyper complex multi-hour ones. The best part is they have game experts on hand, who can recommend games for your particular mood & walk you through all the basic rules (total time saver!).

Since we weren't feeling too intellectual, we ended up playing Pikomimo a German game with domino worms, which was a lot of fun! 

Down side is they require everyone buy food, since they don't have a bar license. Not idea if your planning on just grabbing a drink. 

So we tried the food, but I have to say it was disappointing. I shared the chilli and quesadillas, and both fell flat. I also tried their fresh oven baked cookies, which I think would have been ok had they not come 30 minutes late and burnt. 

So overall, good place to play games, but remember you'll need to eat to order a drink and the food is meh.."}
{"text":"Great food, great games, great staff, great location. 

They have a huge variety of games and it's the perfect place go bond with friends or coworkers. The staff is super nice and friendly and will explain every game you choose. They can also make recommendations depending on the number of people on the table and what genre of games you want. 

The food is good and you don't have a time limit so they won't kick you out after a while. 

Definitely a fun place to go to!"}
{"text":"C'est l'endroit où vous retrouver entre amis un après-midi pluvieux ou pour fêter un anniversaire! Bien sûr ceux qui n'aiment pas les jeux de société doivent s'abstenir....car c'est le temple incontesté du jeu avec ses 500 boîtes environ!
À ce propos, je salue le calme, la bienveillance et la gentillesse de la personne qui nous aide toujours à trouver jeu à notre pied, et qui prend le temps de nous expliquer les règles patiemment, alors que nous faisons les pitres ou que nous nous racontons le dernier gossip! 
Le colonel moutarde est très bien placé sur la rue St Denis en plein cur du plateau et à deux pas du métro Mont royal! 
Ce qui est bien pratique est que vous pouvez disputer une partie de cluedo endiablée tout en dégustant de bonnes collations...
Les quelques plats proposés sont bons et classiques et vous trouverez votre bonheur pour un déjeuner sur le pouce....
Mes coups de cur culinaire vont à deux desserts, les biscuits chauds sortis du four avec un verre de lait et le dessert \"cochonou\" par excellence le S'mores (biscuit, chocolat fondu et chamallows au four.....)
J'appelle cela un véritable dessert régressif....mais c'est ce qui est bon!"}
{"text":"Amazing find! The herbal cocktail was out of this world delicious, I could drink that all the time! Staff was super friendly and help us learn how to play a new board game. They do have darts in the back, which I guess is rare in Montreal, just ask the bar tender for the darts."}
{"text":"Bel endroit, faisant à la fois bar, restaurant et salle de jeux de société! Il y a une quantité incroyable de jeux, pour tous les goûts, tous les âges (enfin 18+) et toutes les tailles de groupe!
Il faut manger un plat (entre 8 et 14$ environ) pour pouvoir consommer de l'alcool (lié au permis, pas le choix) et si vous ne mangez pas, il y aura des frais de 8$ par personne, pour compenser et payer en quelque sorte le jeu.
Il n'y a pas énormément de choix de bouffe, ms assez pour tous les goûts (mac&cheese, pizza, plateau de charcuterie et fromage à 18$, etc..+ desserts...)
Service très agréable, et les serveurs sont là pour vous conseiller sur les jeux, vous les expliquer et vous rappeler les règles du jeu au cas où..
Attendez vous à passer des heures à jouer entre amis, tout en buvant et mangeant!
Vraiment nice, surtout pour les soirées d'hiver!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! I was not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. My family and I were visiting Montreal on vacation and found this spot. It was different. Not only was having game night great, but the food and whiskey/scotch/bourbon was outstanding. You definitely need to take a break here when visiting."}
{"text":"I might be biased a bit because I love board games, but I had a blast at Colonel Moutarde. 

As soon as we sat down, the owner came to us and explained the concept of the \"restaurant\": He is a bartender who loves board games and somehow could only obtain a permit to open a \"restaurant.\" So basically, he decreased our expectations for the food. The menu changes once every few weeks, but when I was there, the menu was pretty ordinary: pizza, sandwiches, burgers, mac&cheese, and pretty much everything comes with a special salad. The plates are also made long and thin, so that you have space to play games while eating. I got the pulled pork burger, which came with chips and a special salad with nuts. I also tasted the mac & cheese with chorizo. Would recommend the mac & cheese more: very rich and flavourful, and a generous portion. Throughout the night, as we played board games, we also got desserts. We tried the s'mores and the oven baked cookies with milk. COOKIES FRESH OUT OF THE OVEN. AND MILK. Nuff said.

The drinks are very special indeed, with most ingredients local or homemade. There are fewer games than Randolph, but more than a good selection. Plus, there is no mandatory consumption every hour. You have to order a meal, but after that, you can stay the whole night. They also have a game master who explains the rules to the games pretty well. Overall would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A decent board game bar. I don't drink so I mainly come to these to eat and play games with friends. As opposed to Randolph's, this place doesn't have a cover charge. Instead, you have to order food (If you don't, it's an 8$ charge). They have these really cute menu's and quite a selection. Most options come with Dorito's so if you aren't a fan, that could be a bummer. 

I ordered the mac and cheese and it was just meh, wasn't very cheesy or tasty. It had Dorito bits inside that added unnecessary crunch and no flavour.  
My friend got the jumbo hot dog and she really loved hers. 

We played abalone, a Japanese strategy game, and some word association game.

Abalone: kind of like checkers but with marbles
Japanese strategy game: Chess but with limited moves that vary each game
Word association game: It gives you a category and a letter, first one to find the word wins the card. This can be played forever.

Our server was nice but he refused to speak english even though my friend really prefers english. So that was a bit annoying.

When you enter, head for the tables on the left if you can. You'll be closer to the games and the tables are more suited to gaming (lighting). 
This place is basically separated into an area more for gaming and more for drinking. We mistakenly sat in the drinking section so the lighting was terrible and the table was uneven.

Still enjoyed myself a lot!"}
{"text":"We had a great time visiting Le Colonel Moutarde for a game night! Keep in mind - each person in the party has to order food, so only go when hungry. I had the tacos, and my husband had the hot dog. The food is fine, but not great. Just think of it as your cover to be able to play the games! The beer list was pretty decent, and they looked like they could make a great cocktail.

We waited a little while for our game host to come visit our table, but were very well attended to after that. He asked us what kind of games we like/what mood we were in (knowledge games, competitive games) and chose two great options. We started with a game where you placed events/inventions on a historical timeline (got to practice our french) and then moved to a chess-like game. Very fun night!"}
{"text":"Snap out of it! You don't have to do the usual nightly search, I also find myself in so often... Mediterranean... Italian... Japanese... you know what I'm talking about. Sure the mouth sensations differ but the mind experiences the same thing - stare at menu, cut and chew, swish drink, pay, and leave. Next day, repeat. Repeat. Die of old age.

Let the Le Colonel rescue your evening.

Disclaimer: We're not gamers. Unless you could Go Fish or Uno. So I'll be honest, we were a bit overwhelmed. We fumbled through our first game until the game concierge/guru/all around friendly guy came by. He took us by the hand, and said everything would be alright. Then based on a quick chat, Quatro appeared. Well instructed we were off playing through dinner.

0-2: My wife started strong, or maybe I was distracted by the great wine the waitress recommended. Mm, the light effervescence brings out the geek in me.

1-2: She was distracted when her order of \"The Nerd\" arrived. How can you pick between chicken fingers, mini hotdogs, or Doritos.

2-2: Tied up. My perfectly balanced Bahn Mi sandwich with tender meat and veggies was giving me the mental clarity needed to keep track of dastardly pieces.

3-2: In the lead. Now with a second drink in hand, I confidently played my hands while stealing my wife's Doritos. Perhaps it was too much.

Winner! Look, it's not whether you win or lose, you'll have a fun and memorable evening. I want to thank the knowledgeable game guru, our friendly waitress and the on point bar staff, for a great night. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"A really nice location, a really nice atmosphere The Colonel is a great place to hang with friends. Food and games, is there anything better? We had lots of fun with simple games (we felt too burn as a group to play anything too cerebral) and got a bite to eat at the same time. 

The food presentation was excellent, but the food was only good. We had the quesadilla and chilli as well as popcorn and fresh baked cookies. My favorite by far was fresh baked cookies! Check out the full menu in my attached photos. 

Still a great option for those nights you wanna hang with friends and grab some food. Only thing our waitress was clear everyone needed to order food. Not sure if that is 100% true but can impact a group plan. With a full bar and full wall of games (as well as a game curator) it was a really great night."}
{"text":"Really, really loved this place! Walked in off the street but really appreciated the hospitality of the Sunday night weight staff. The atmosphere was good, the food was tasty, and the drinks were prime. Good selection of beers and craft cocktails. Lots of fun board games as well. I was alone, but the bartender (who DJ'ed some early 2000's punk rock off her iPod) took very good care of me, invited me to play a board game, and sent me on my way with a shot for the road!"}
{"text":"Great staff, really cool vibe! I love the games! I got the mac and cheese and it was absolutely incredible!"}
{"text":"Our family had a wonderful time here this evening. The food was delicious and the game master suggested a few games to play and explained our choice clearly. Wish we lived nearer so we could return."}
{"text":"Perfect food, atmosphere, and service, especially on a cold winter afternoon. Owner Gizmo took *incredible* care of us. Recommended cocktails, food and board games (there are hundreds) and every single one was fantastic."}
{"text":"Belle ambiance décontractée pour apprendre de nouveaux jeux. La musique n'est pas trop forte alors il est facile de comprendre les règles sans crier. Un \" sommelier \" de jeux se fait un plaisir de trouver un jeu qui convient à la tablée. Des trous aux 4 coins des tables préviennent les accidents et les dégâts : on y dépose son verre.

Le brise-glace est un cocktail maison aux bleuets. Le hot-dog géant est savoureux. Je vais revenir ici !"}
