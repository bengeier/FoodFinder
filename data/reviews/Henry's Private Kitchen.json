{"text":"As a Taiwanese, I was very disappointed by this place. We ordered 6 dishes the other night and none of them were authentic. The owner clearly have not tasted real Taiwanese food before. Various items on the menu should not be considered \"Taiwanese cuisine,\" the spicy boiling fish pot for example. The service was ok but the food was quite pricy. I hesitate to recommend this restaurant if you are looking for authentic \"Taiwanese\" food. Personally, I will not go again."}
{"text":"Horrible! I came here when it first opened and it was good. This has since been sold to a group who does not cook authentic Taiwanese food nor is it worth the cost.  The food court food is better! Don't bother wasting money here and be disappointed. 



I typically don't bother writing reviews, but I have to warn all hopeful customer who craves good food to don't waste your time or money.

The oyster pancake was SOUR, nothing was fresh, and I wondered why there were only a few  customer on a Friday night. Clearly most prior visitors have all left!

Also, I almost double tipped because they Automatically added 20% tip to our bill when nowhere on their menu or anywhere in the restaurant they post they may do that!  We only have 3 adults in our party!  When confronted, the waitress simply said that was the management'a decision and many have complained about it before and there is nothing shr can do.

I will never come back again!"}
{"text":"As a Chinese, I personally had really good experience here! The food are awesome! The hot pot, three cup chicken, Taiwanese snack... Everything is just perfect for me!Best chinese food in the town! (They have over 120 items on the menu!!!)"}
{"text":"Though a little bit more expensive than average, their food are awesome! Really authentic delicious Chinese food. They also offer delivery to ASU. They have to improve their menu and the water quality"}
{"text":"Having just come back from china myself, I can honestly say that the food here is the most authentic I've had in the valley! Excellent service and food!"}
{"text":"We've been to their Tempe location and this location many times. I prefer the Mesa location"}
{"text":"Perhaps this is only one in a few times that I have been dining in a taiwanese restaurant... there is a definite difference in how food is prepared...it is not mainland Chinese food...

With that said...it was difficult to choose any dinner entrees, and the very helpful host offered some nice suggestions... I settled on the beef in hot sauce... I wanted something spicy so with some hesitation she brought my order to be cooked...and...spice it up a bit...!!!

My meal arrived after only a short period of time...piping hot, with a small bowl of steamed rice. My goodness, remarkable flavors...yes a little kick...oh it was delicious...!!!

My first visit, greeted immediately by a very polite young lady...very nice atmosphere, good decor...warm and inviting. The music playing was nice but a little bit to loud for me.

This is a small business...these are your friends and neighbors...extend some support...go enjoy a great night out, sharing some remarkable foods with your family and friends...see you there...!!!"}
{"text":"service was very bad but they had stinky tofu so i didnt complain how long it took for them to bring me water let alone a menu. but when i said service was bad i meant it was BAAAD! i had to flag them down for everything. the food is decent, not the best i have had. i have definitely had better stinky tofu, but i was just happy they made it at their restaurant. i honestly wouldnt come back here again, because there are other places who care about their customers more."}
{"text":"the three cup pork feet is really delicious??? and I love the basil chicken and three cup pork feet"}
{"text":"What can I say about Henry's private kitchen ? A little disappointed! My husband and I drove here to eat last night all the way from north scottsdale, and was expecting something yummy. We ordered three dishes: oyster pancake, fried chicken tenders, and kejia stir fry with four ingredients. (I had high expectations , because I have been to Henry's kitchen in Tempe a few times and really liked their food. )The only dish I liked was the fried chicken tenders, portion was okay, but it could have used a little more seasoning. The kejia stir fry was the worst, it had dried bean curd , thinly sliced pork, celery and some squid. Some of the pork slices were just completely pure fat! I had to choose and pick through this dish..... Oyster pancake was a mistake on our end. I have never been a big fan of this dish, my husband loves to eat oysters but he had forgotten last time he ordered this he didn't like it. Be aware! If you like your pancake crispy, this is not the dish for you. The oyster pancake comes standard like other Taiwanese places I have tried before, however this particular dish is kind of soggy and it's just how it is. Will I ever come back again? Maybe.. I would definitely not order these dishes again though."}
{"text":"Most Newly Open Restaurants do open with a few hiccups and that is to be expected. Henry's Private Kitchen opened with a big menu of 200 items but you can't order any of unless you can read Mandarin Chinese. They do have a one page menu without descriptions of 38 items for Americans. Our host seemed very friendly and tried to be very helpful during our visit but only recommended dishes to us from the American Menu. I do note our host made the effort to ask me what I liked and might have actually suggested the dishes I might have enjoyed most. The host suggested a Korean Dish to me and a Thai Style Eggplant. I insisted I wanted to try Taiwanese Dishes and that's why I came here. So he then suggested the Three Cup Chicken and the Luffa.

First comes out the Luffa. The Luffa was very fresh and had a refreshing quality to it like a cucumber but a meatier texture in a silky chicken based sauce. We both were surprised on how good it was. I usually can eat with chop sticks but I wasn't advanced enough with chop sticks for luffa it just keep slipping out and the kind host offered me a fork.

Next comes out the Three Cup Chicken. It is called Three Cup Chicken because the recipe was based on one cup vinegar, one cup sugar and one cup soy sauce along with garlic and ginger and studded with that perfect amount of fresh Thai Basil (that you only get at BEST Thai places) it's a Classic Taiwanese Dish. I thought the Chicken was very flavorful and Moist and Good! I am good with Chicken on the bone but the pieces of as tasty as it was chicken were very small and not only was the dish filled with many small bones I had many sharp shards of bones all threw the chicken. 

I do think if the chicken was in slightly bigger pieces it would be fine but I also realize it would have to cook longer.

For me the food was good. Three stars is not negative in anyway but it means worth trying but with some reservations. I do also note again that this business has only been open a week offers something different and is certain to improve.

5 star potential is here."}
{"text":"Glad to be back in AZ to try some more of the Henry's!

As I remember it from last school year, the menu isn't exactly kind to the Chinese illiterate (including myself). But ask the servers and they'll be very helpful with ordering your food.

Kitchen in the back seems clean, and it's run by real Chinese chefs! I mean, literally, they don't speak much English. That has got to be legit.

For the price and ambiance of the outdoor-style tents pitched up indoors, I love coming here to gorge on some authentic Chinese food.

Best part-- Opens until very late."}
{"text":"??????????????????????"}
{"text":"Positives - Food is great: Very authentic to Taiwan. The beef sate is my favorite.  Service is friendly and pretty fast. Negatives - dishes are pricey. Almost every one is $10 or more.  Even just a plate of vegetables is $9 or more.  Also,  the menu is huge but the majority of items are not a available and I don't believe they ever will be. One funny thing is they don't give you any napkins unless you ask for them."}
{"text":"I don't know why and when they closed this restaurant. But I lost my favorite Chinese restaurant in that area."}
{"text":"Henry's Private Kitchen is the pricier version of Henry's Kitchen. They serve some \"fancier\" dishes that usually have a bit of flare (not really street food).

I ordered the fried tofu with pepper and the minced pork rice bowl with my wife. The dishes were quite large and seriously tasty. Service was quick and the restaurant itself was clean and tidy.

My only issue was the price which is higher than I expected when I first saw the menu. 

I actually prefer Henry's Private Kitchen over the regular Henry's restaurant which serves more along the lines of street food type dishes."}
{"text":"Ending up here on a whim after looking at the noodle shop down the side walk. I didn't feel like noodles, so another time.
     We made the right choice.
     This isn't your normal westernized Chinese food. It's from Taiwan and it's great. 
     There are no egg rolls or crab puffs or other apps. Just great food.
     We had the King Pao Chicken, There was a ton of chicken and the peanuts were tender and fresh.
     The Shrimp Fried Rice was fantastic. It had a wonderful light flavor and the shrimp was tender and perfectly cooked.
     We nibbled on the spare ribs. They had a nice light crunch on the skin and a delicate sauce.
     I'll be back soon so I can enjoy a Hot Pot by myself when my wife visits her sister. No one likes to share the best foods."}
