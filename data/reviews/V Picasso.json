{"text":"Wow. This was a side of Champaign I didn't know existed. The space is warm without being rustic, artistic and art-deco is more apt. There is jewelry displayed in windows and on the walls, so the place feels like a foodie art gallery in some ways. The waiter was the most friendly and helpful and conversational waitstaff I have ever encountered. 

And the food. Man. What a way to break from my campus habits of Chipotle and Torticas. A friend and I did two started and shared the entree and dessert. We chose the beef tartare and roasted bone marrow appetizers. It was my first time trying steak tartare and I was really pleased with it, though the potato chips that come with it to eat are a little overpowering for the tartare. The bone marrow is as rich and indulgent as you might expect, and well complemented by the toasts it comes with. 

Our entree was the grilled Berkshire farms pork chop and came with a side of cheesy macaroni and arugula. The pork chop was very substantial and somehow crispy, almost like it was fried. Very nicely done and the apple sauce is delicious made from local apples from Curtis Orchard.

Dessert was a funnel cake drizzled with caramel and topped with whipped cream. So good! Definitely lighter than your average Funnel cake, and also super crispy and crunchy."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The server was friendly and knowledgeable as but the food preparation and history of the restaurant. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had an amazing time we loved the food I had the salmon and it was fantastic my husband had the pasta with the rabbit and morale and he said it was the best he has had. it's so exciting to have something like this z in our community nice job Victor."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff that goes the extra mile to accommodate vegan diners. Beautiful outdoor dining area. Great food!"}
{"text":"had the steak, would have been better off going to Longhorn, the 14 oz steak was 7 oz of fat. should have sent it back. and the fries that came with it were soggy."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. Ambiance is five stars. Great light fixtures, bathroom was fantastic, fun little lounge area in the bar. Our server was extremely friendly, a little chatty, but some people dig that so I won't fault them for that. My drink was also super tasty. 

In theory, the dishes sound great and I enjoy the fact that they locally source some menu items, but they just really dropped the ball on execution. The number one issue: salt. Only one of our dishes came out almost seasoned. It blew my mind how every single dish was lacking the quintessential seasoning. Kosher salt is your friend, kids. And the fact that they didn't have any placed on the table was a real misstep. 

Our fried brussel sprouts came out rather soggy. If the batter had been crisp and hit with a sprinkle of kosher immediately after the fry, they would've been great. The mashed potatoes which came with our (unseasoned) fried chicken tasted like a straight boiled potato fresh out of unsalted boiling water. I'm not someone who has to drown everything in butter to make it taste better, but when mashing potatoes you have to add a fat component to get that creaminess- whether it be butter, cream, or even milk. There seemed to be nothing but straight potato. 
Smoked salmon was... odd. It seemed somewhere between raw and smoked in texture. Very little smoke flavor. Potato pancakes served with this also needed (you guessed it) salt. Luckily it was served with capers which added a nice salt component. 
Overall it was a pretty bland meal which is really unfortunate. I think they're almost there, but just really need to step up the game on seasoning. You don't need a ton when you have good ingredients but that doesn't mean you can omit it completely. I hope they pull it together because I'd love to return and be blown away. Rooting for you guys."}
{"text":"Great brunch food. We had the steak and eggs, chicken and waffles and eggs Benedict and all three were great. Also need to try the chocolate warm donut, it was so good and enough to share for three people. Price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"the cheese platter was awesome. the ambience is great as well.

the food is definitely interesting..we tried rabbit meat and venison. didn't really take to it because new meats take me some getting used to.

if you like gourmet food, you will enjoy this place."}
{"text":"We had an excellent dinner here last night. Very concerned that the place was almost empty.
Appetizers were a wedge salad and crostini both of which were excellent.
Mains were scallops with fried green tomatoes and a seafood stew. Both were very good but the seafood stew had some rubbery octopus in it."}
{"text":"My second time there and both times I thought the food was very good. They just rolled out their new menu and I had the duck. Service though was a bit lacking though. Jen our waitress was fine, the issue was the very slow service both getting our drinks and our entrees. It was a nice night and the outdoor seating was very full and that was their excuse for the slow service. If that is the case then they need to add a bartender and another sous chef to handle the volume. We were inside and it was only about half full so they will be in real trouble if they pack the house."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I decided to go exploring and we found V Picasso - which we haven't been to before so we were excited. The place has a very romantic atmosphere. Being on a temp vegetarian diet unfortunately norrowed my option for most of the main dishes. Of the two I was able to taste I can whole heartily say they were awesome. The vegetarian lasangia was amazing and the rizoto was also pretty awesome - but a bit too much for me... So I'm happy my dish was the lasaniga :)
Our server was very attentive and helped us to a great wine selection. 
It's important to mention that the place is a bit pricy especially for the tiny portions you get. Our goat cheese and arugula salad appetizer was super tiny - but super super tasty. 
All in all it's definitely worth a try. Especily since there aren't many great restaurants in our area that take their food seriously."}
{"text":"Pretty pricey, but great for special occasions. Also good to grab some wine and sit on their fun, albeit small, couch area. So much outdoor seating in the summer!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today with my husband, mother-in-law, and my 4 year old daughter and it was wonderful. Everything was really good, pricey but good. Of course between three adults we had 5 beers and 2 glasses of wine so over a third of our bill was alcohol...whoopsy ;) We tried the fried green tomato starter, pork belly flatbread, grilled chicken flatbread, and the cuban burger. All were delicious and quite filling. They don't' have a children's menu so the waiter was kind enough to ask the chef to make the Croque Monsieur into just a roasted ham and gruyere sandwich for my daughter on a pretzel bun instead with fries (a side option for all sandwiches) and they were more than willing. In fact we all had a bite and loved it! It was probably the best ham sandwich that little girl had ever eaten! Haha!"}
{"text":"Sat outside on a perfect evening, the waiter was outstanding and his recommendations were perfect. A musician was playing a sax to some terrific music! This was my first time at V Picasso, but will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Came here with a party that booked a reservation weeks in advanced, yet somehow the restaurant was still incredibly unprepared. First round of drinks took 10+ minutes to get to the table, second round was ordered but never received, still wound up on our check though which ended up being corrected. We started off with the bruschetta, and one under-cooked bacon wrapped sea scallop which I suspect to be the culprit of an issue later in this review. I ordered the steak, which was an 8 oz filet, cooked medium rare. It came out as a Pittsburgh rare, instead of being traditionally grilled, which wasn't mentioned beforehand at all by our server, who we also failed to see for at least a solid hour after our order was taken. The steak was tender, but had a very bland taste, unlike the catfish that my friend ordered which was burnt almost to a crisp and tasted like a bag of over-seasoned chex mix. Our table had finished eating before the table next to us had even received their food, all of our party ordered at relatively the same time. I talked myself out of creating a profile, and writing a negative review, until I woke up at 4AM this morning with what I can only imagine to be food poisoning. Will not be coming back, would not recommend.

The cheese plate was okay.

TLDR: Spent $80 to receive less than mediocre service, and food poisoning."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and great drinks! The food was so well prepared - I can't wait to sit outside again and try the whole menu! I had never tried one marrow before (I was a total skeptic) but I did for the first time, and I can't wait to try it again. The way the food is prepared makes you want to try things you never have before!"}
{"text":"Warm atmosphere and exquisite menu. Really love the bone marrow as appetizer, and the angus burger is also exceedingly awesome. Definitely a restaurant deserving being recommended to my friends."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding. The produce was farm  to table, very fresh. We had a salad with a light cream sauce, tuna tartar, and two different flatbreads: pork belly and beet/white bean humus. We will go back. 

We had dinner outside. When we return, we will sit further from the street or inside. Neil street is pretty well transited and the traffic can be distracting. 

The service was very nice."}
{"text":"Dinner here is not good. At all. My duck breast was severely undercooked, with half of it inedible, and the server nowhere to be found once I discovered it. My wife's ribeye was similar very rare. They must be cooking with an EZ-Bake oven in the back.

And the prices for the quality of the food, even if cooked correctly, are outrageous. The food was underseasoned and just did not go well together. 

Brunch is decent, however, and will be the only meal I'll be returning to this restaurant for, if I ever do choose to visit again."}
{"text":"Picasso is a welcomed addition to the downtown Champaign food scene. Among my favorite menu items are the crawfish flatbread and the fried oysters( which are no longer on the menu). Picasso is also the place where I have discovered a love for the true daquari. I appreciate the decor and inner city feel of the restaurant, which is a welcome escape living in a college town. Definitely one of my new go-to restaurants in the area. Please note: the price point is a bit higher than other restaurants in the area and could be considered a downside for those on stricter budgets."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my gf couple nights ago. The place itself looks very nice and elegant. However my gf's steak came out medium well when asked for a medium rare/rare. We were one of two couples eating at the time In the entire restaurant, I don't see how the steak could come out over.

 I had the rabbit pasta dish. Although good, it was not good enough for the price and quantity given.  I asked the waiter about the size of the dish because I was very hungry. He definitely exaggerated the size by at least double. I was given an appetizer amount of food that I finished in less than 10 bites. 

Once our bill came I noticed we were also charged for a glass of wine that we did not order. We had no wine at all that night.

I would give them some time to get settled before going back for a second time."}
{"text":"AVOID !!! Their food taste better as vomit. I have met a few of their cooks and they are always high or drunk, if you walk to the alley you can tell the area reeks of sativa. Pretty unsanitary for my standards, which are not particularly high. Save yourself an uncontrollable and explosive bowel movement and go to the closest restaurant : Destihl, Big Grove are much better options."}
{"text":"Good menu for a small town that gives you big city variety.  Charcuterie board is great.   Bourbon menu could be stepped up a bit. 

Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"I don't typically write reviews, but this place is incredible. We have been two times. The first time was good, but the second time it was outstanding. You can tell that they are tweaking the restaurant to make it very good. 

I highly recommend the salmon with bacon jam and zucchini - one of my favorite meals I've ever had. Prices are a bit high, but I feel that the quality makes it worth it."}
{"text":"Neat little bar/ sit-down restaurant. Decorations are rustic and reminds me of a small bar in cities. I got the prosecco and moderno (?) which were both good! Only downside is that it closes at midnight. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"The good: I had a pleasant, cozy, leisurely early dinner at the couch seating area near front door.  The desserts are phenomenal.  I've never had a more luxurious doughnut experience. Beautiful, stylish decor and furniture.  Even the bathroom sinks are noteworthy.  The waitstaff are very, very nice and not rushed, even though they're undoubtedly busy.  

The awkward: The coffee table at the couch is one-foot wide--not nearly enough for 2 tapas & 3 drinks (and there was seating for 5).  Any time something new was brought to the table, we all had to participate in the shuffle and rearrangement to make it all fit, or just hold our drinks. Not a big deal, but this could've been prevented with a bigger table to begin with.

The bad: The glasses of wine were served about 1/4 full, what would pass for a \"taste\" by many other standards. Either I'm ignorant about wine serving portions or we were ripped off.  I felt ripped off.  We went in expecting to burn some money at this place, but everything was painfully expensive. Either I'm a cheapskate, or we got ripped off.  I felt ripped off.  Do they want an \"exclusive\" clientele?  Do I \"belong\" there?  I wanted to love this place, but sadly I won't be back until I can save up for it."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for a glass of wine while out on a last minute date night. 
We had already eaten, so we just sat in the bar. I had a glass of wine and my husband skipped having anything once we had been treated as lesser customers. Sadly, the bar tender didn't seem to think we were worth much attention... maybe because we weren't dressed fancy enough. I don't know... don't judge a book by its cover. (I digress) 

So the wine was great and the menu looked stunning! We will be back for a real meal at some point. (Don't worry snobby bar tender... I'll dress up next time to meet you expectations and judgmental side glare.) 

Hopefully next time I'll find this place is with more stars... based on the look and menu, it should be! Very impressive."}
{"text":"Been meaning to review this place for sometime now. Came in a few weeks ago with my lady and a few of her friends. This place fills up quick on the weekends we didn't have a reservation and the wait was longer than host mentioned no biggie. We sat at the bar grabbed a few drinks. My girl asked the guy bartending if something was sweet and he responded kinda shitty \"compared to what\"? Our server was real cool so informative food was killer."}
{"text":"Dinner is great, I love the red wine selections. 
Brunch is awesome too. Coffee is piping hot and perfectly brewed, and I had the egg and corn tortilla dish - out of this world. I love this place and will always return!"}
{"text":"Dinner for 7 was a disappointment. One of the pork chop dinners was served raw. The Osso buco was dry and over cooked, although it tasted good. The scallops we very good and our waitress was also very good. Just not worth the money."}
{"text":"I brought my visiting gal pals to V Picasso for a nice dinner on the town. I had never had dinner there before, but I had brunch once and it was absolutely fantastic! From the start we loved the service with quirky, yet charming, 143 (aka \"Trent\"). 

We curated a cheese and meat board with the assistance of Trent. His recommendations were on point (loved the Prairie Fruit Farm Brie) and were paired well with the jams, honey (RIP the bees), and focaccia. Our meals were delicious. The linguine and clams had surprising kick to it and the squid ink pasta was so fresh! The risotto and salmon were also great choices. 

While the restaurant was out of all desserts, this place still gets 5 stars and I highly recommend it! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, and excellent food. I really appreciated the range of vegetarian options (all excellent!) and the friendliness of the service. We went here for an anniversary dinner and loved it. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"In Champaign for a job assignment and had a day off so I wanted to drive around and find some good eats. Came upon this place V Picasso which had a sign next to it that says \"We grow our own\" which pretty much means farm to table. That always attracts me so I gave it a try. I had the grilled duck breast with veggies on it. The dish was very delicious but my only mistake was that I should have ask for the duck skin on the breast to be crispy for the duck fat is what makes the dish but nonetheless I loved it and it was very satisfying. Had a glass of Malbec wine to go with it and to finish off, I had an espresso and the Halva Shortbread for dessert. Many might find that the food is on the pricey side but I don't care. I'll pay to eat good and healthy especially when it's farm to table. The service was great as the waiter was very attentive."}
{"text":"Having sufficiently procrastinated on making reservations for graduation weekend, we were pleasantly surprised to find that the recently-opened V. Picasso had plenty of availability for lunch.

The cocktail and wine menus are comprehensive and priced relatively reasonably, given the average entree cost. As other reviewers have noted, the staff are very quick to bring you the \"correct\" glass for the type of wine you're ordering, which can lead to the server running around like a chicken with its head cut off when things get busy.

The new iteration is slightly less tapas-focused than the old Urbana location, but still has plenty of dishes to share. The bone marrow, octopus ceviche, and ahi tuna were all highlights, although small enough to the point where two people struggled to share each of them. The entrees were tasty as well, although on the smaller side and probably priced just a bit too high for the market.

Ambiance is nice, with a large, open dining room with high ceilings, which helps to dampen noise a bit. Outdoor seating is available for nicer days, and there is plenty of space to accommodate groups. 

The restaurant is still working on rolling out a lunch menu, so the only items offered during the day are off the dinner menu. This should be changing in June 2015, but something to keep in mind if you'd pop in during the day.

Overall, I'd eat here again, but it wouldn't be on the top of my list unless I was celebrating a special occasion or in town on a per diem."}
{"text":"Really awesome food and service here! Mostly been for brunch but went recently for dinner. The biscuit and jam is so good and homemade! I loved the potatoes the way they make then is unique. The food always tastes fresh and I like that they are connected with a local farm. 

The linguine and clam was so good. I heard the salmon was pretty good as well!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had a wonderful dinner experience. We ordered Mushroom ravioli (with sage and goat cheese), which was cooked to perfection and the portion was just the right size, and braised pork belly with avocado grits and fried lotus root. The pork was juicy and had a crispy, charred exterior. Lotus fried roots were crunchy and quite enjoyable. We ordered Moscato wine to go with it and it was quite good. Our server was a lovely young woman, who knew the menu quite well. The service was a bit slow and we had to wait long periods to pay the bill and all, but it was a good experience overall. Would be back for food and drinks."}
{"text":"Only the interior decoration worth the star. 

The scallops were too salty to eat. My friend got the lamb which was just ok. We also ordered the shrimp toast, which was very sour......

Service was slow. The waiter forgot to give us the 
knives and fork after the entrees were served......

With all due respect, I can't relate myself to those who gave five stars to this restaurant . 

Well, I would very much like to spend the money elsewhere........."}
{"text":"Excellent choices of wine, Food is fantastic, and very well made mixed drinks by the bartender.
 
Best part of the wine is they have it on tap incase you want it as fresh as it gets. Friday half off wine makes it accessible to get a good grasp of their wide variety of wine, with the vary knowledgeable barkeep referring some great wine based off of merely asking what type of flavor you like. 
Food is even fresher, with new menus based on food based locally. The chef has great talent in making new food, like Sorghum Roasted WCF Pork Belly or remixing classic favorites like French Onion soup and the classic burger with different cheeses. The Sunday brunch also has my favorite Eggs Benedict with easily the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had. 
The Bartender is an excellent Mixologist as well, making classics like my favorite the Martini. The Martini wasn't my favorite until I had it here and now I refuse to go without at least having one made by Jake. There are also brand new drinks made either on the fly, or on the drink menu, with drinks being rotated out with every new food menu. 

All in all, if you visit Champaign-Urbana, V. Picasso is a must"}
{"text":"Here on a Sunday, no one else in the place, still took 20 minutes to get drinks. Had to tell waiter and bartender how to make a sidecar  desserts were not good. Like they were in fridge for a week. Not plated properly, missing components. Very sub par. Fortunately the manager on duty"}
{"text":"Came in last night and was seated with no drink menu (thought it was a wine bar?) then given waters and ignored for 15 minutes. Got up and left. Thanks a ton"}
{"text":"This is my fiance and my's favorite place. Brunch, lunch, dinner, entertaining friends from out of town, stopping in for a glass of wine after a movie -- it's all great. I love trying their seasonal dishes, and am a huge fan of the build-your-own bloody mary, where you can add veggies, fried hand-pulled mozzarella, shrimp, et.c It's like a mini meal of it's own! The staff are always friendly and well-versed in the food and wine. I appreciate what they do and am happy they've set up shop in downtown Champaign!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I can't say that this place stands out. I came in on a Saturday evening with 3 friends and was seated super quickly. The server was by far my favorite part, he was friendly, had great suggestions, and was really interesting to talk to (apparently he roasts peppers for their jelly in his front yard?) The food was the part that I didn't particularly like. My friends ordered Green Tomato Gumbo, Scallops, and Cerviche. I had Pork with orecchiette. We all shared a charcuterie board.


The board game with some pickled veg in the middle along with foccacia, a honey and a jelly spread, and meat and cheese we ordered. I thought that the meat and cheese and bread were great but the jelly/honey/vegetables were pretty unpalatable. My pork was alright but it was rather dry and the orecchiette was overcooked and cold when it arrived in front of me. The main reason why I can't give it a 4 stars is the pesto came with my food, it was incredibly bitter and I didn't eat of the food that was touching it because it was that bad."}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate here during finals week as a break from all the studying. It was our first time and we chose it based on the menu, location and atmosphere. Our server was very welcoming and helpful. We decided to \"graze\" on a cheese plate and two appetizers. The cheese plate was served with a tapenade, grainy mustard and two jellies along with plenty of wonderful focaccia. Then we went on to beef tartare with toast points and Parmesan crisps and the acorn squash and goat cheese salad. We thought the food was amazing, delicious, fresh and high quality. Our only complaints were about the wines as we tasted four different ones. Two by the glass and two \"on tap\". Unfortunately the red wine on tap was chilled which dulled the taste. The Chardonnay on tap was better but tasted weak. So overall, it was a good experience and we would go back but this time will take them up on the offer to sample a few wines before deciding on one."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior, terrible food.  Brunch order took forever, simple enough eggs came out cold and congealed.  Another cold dish was clearly reheated in the microwave, making it soggy.  Waitstaff was nice and apologetic, but that doesn't make up for poor quality for expensive prices.  Won't return."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great atmosphere, It feels very warm and inviting in the dining area. Everything we tasted was so delicious! We had the tuna appetizer, quail, salmon flatbread... tried tasting couple wines. Our server was very knowledgeable and made great recommendations on food and wine. My favorite part was probably the desserts. The donuts and the chocolate torte was awesome! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Service was awful, pork belly overdone and hard as a rock. Had to walk up to bar to get drink refills because such poor wait service."}
{"text":"It was date night! My boyfriend had decided to surprise me and take me to dinner since it was my last night is Champaign-Urbana. Reservations were made for saturday night at 830 and we chose to sit indoors. The inside dining area was not busy at all we had even showed up about 15 minutes early and they had zero trouble seating us early. However, the outdoor seating area was completely full. 
 The decor of the restaurant was very simple and elegant. Twinkling tea lights, white lines, low classic music. It was very easy to take our seats and relax and carry conversation.
 Our waiter was very nice and very helpful. As usual we asked for wine recommendations and he knew exactly what to recommend. I personally love a sweeter wine, and let me tell you the glass of  Giancarlo Moscato I had was so good! He had a glass of red wine, which he enjoyed as well.
 We ordered an appetizer to share, the lamb meatballs. They where very good, the red sauce they come served in was so good! The meatballs them self had a very mild and yummy flavor and the cheese served with it was also very creamy and yummy too. 
 Our main courses were also so good! I had ordered the seafood pasta which was a ribbon noodle with steamed mussels, blu crab and lobster. Everything about this dish was visually appealing as well as were all the flavors. Though if I where to make one critic I would say maybe more pasta to the seafood ratio. My date had ordered the lobster roll and it was served with homemade chips. He said his roll was very good and I had to steal a few of his chips and omg they were so good! Everything had come out in a very timely manner and once again our waiter was very nice and helpful.
 Over all our experience here was very good. Delicious food and great wine. However, we felt they were a little pricey for what they are. If you're looking for a yummy meal on the nicer dinning side of Champaign V. Picasso is a great place."}
{"text":"Well I am not writing about the food but for my terrible experience on the reservation. I made an reservation for Monday dinner and called on Friday and Saturday before to confirm.since it was a quite special dinner.  However on Monday it was CLOSED when we arrive, without any prior notification. That's a one star."}
{"text":"This review is more for management, but they lost all their stars for one very bad decision.  After receiving my doctorate degree yesterday, and having made BRUNCH reservations 7 weeks prior as it is graduation weekend and my family is in town, we showed up for our brunch reservation only to be told that they decided to do \"Dinner all day\" instead.  Now my wife had called to confirm a BRUNCH reservation 3 days prior and we were not told of this, which might have left us a chance to find another option for 7 people.  Instead, their management decided to change their menu, not call people with a 10:30am brunch reservation to alert them to the decision.  I don't care what field or industry you're in, that is just not acceptable.  The host offered a pity gift certificate, by only after we had been standing on the sidewalk for 10 minutes trying to find another option. If that had been offered immediately, maybe I wouldn't be so sour to V.Picasso, but It was not prompt or offered easily. Be careful if you are planning anything special here, it might fall apart when you arrive.  So very disappointing."}
{"text":"This meal for myself and all 3 of my dinner mates was meh at best. The asparagus appetizer was the highlight for me for sure. Served with chips and capers, we polished it off. The market New York strip my husband ordered was pretty good, not great. My gnocchi was inedible. It was cold so I sent it back. When they brought me a new plate, it looked better visually but didn't taste much better in actuality. My mom's scallops were ok. She didn't really care for them so my dad and husband finished them for her but neither of them were raving about it. My dad's rack of pork was over cooked and dry. Overall, incredibly underwhelming for a $200+ dinner. Service and asparagus were the highlights. Our server was very sweet and bubbly."}
{"text":"I made reservations for a Saturday night even though the place was half empty. I came in skeptical, some reviews read that the place is great, others mentioned bland food and a too good to be true drink menu. Unfortunately we experienced both of the poor reviews, the pork shank and fettuccini both were bland and over priced for what they were and three different drinks we attempted to order were out of stock. 

This place is beautiful inside and has a great atmosphere and very helpful, friendly service. I will return because I really want to find good food here, but if my next visit is as bland as the last I won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"The fish stew was, for lack of a better word, awful.

However, the service was excellent and the onion strings fabulous."}
{"text":"Good food, great intimate atmosphere. If you go avoid Zack as your server or your experience will be tainted. The cocktails are fantastic and Josh the bartender is amazing. Interesting menu items and lots of great specials. Sunday brunch is fun and they feature $20 mimosa bottles  Definitely a wonderful addition to the downtown Champaign restaurant scene."}
{"text":"We went on a date night and this is a heaven for wine and sea food lovers..the oysters were amazing and so was the octopus ceviche..the ahi tuna was a perfect entree to go with the wine suggested (Taken Complicated).."}
{"text":"Warm Red wine in wrong glass... Smallish pour... Guess this flys in Champaign, near Chicago they'd be closed. Didn't try the food after the wine experience."}
{"text":"Went with big groups the two times I went here. Ambiance is lovely and rustic. The concept is terrific (farm to table), too. The service--I had a very professional and friendly mid-aged man--was also very knowledgeable and attentive. One of my party (a visiting professor) put up a mild huff about how the wine \"not being cold enough\" (something my cheap ass would probably let go from the get-go), but he handled it with aplomb. We got multiple dishes, including a cheese and bread tray, eggplant parm, some sort or cheesy kimchi thing, and another kind of braised beef. All were fresh and mouth-watering to the eyes. And the wine selection was fantastic. My only complaint--and it's enough to knock off a star--is that the food was just to darn salty. You had to drown out many of the dishes with the extra bread on the table. It's possible most of V Picasso's regular patrons like their food on the extra salty side, but I as well as my other dinner mates agree that you couldn't eat too much of the food because of the salt content. So that was a big disappointment, particularly given that everything else was spades. So if they can just cut back on the salt, maybe they're be on the track to 4 (hell even 5 stars) in my book. But until then... one can only hope and wait."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and have enjoyed the food and service.  Last night however was not the case.  The food was still good the service was just off.  We were running late (3 kids to grandmas is never easy), the plan was to have a glass of wine or two before dinner and to take advantage of the happy hour special.  My wife sat down at the bar at 5:57pm (3 minutes left of happy hour) and ordered us each a glass.  The bartender said he would give her one... like he was doing her a favor. She was actually there earlier and was waiting on him.  He finally obliged and gave her and I one.  Later when we ordered our second glass with dinner it had 25% more wine in the glass.  So he gave us 3/4 of a pour.

It was our 10 year anniversary and when they called to confirm earlier that day they said \"Is it true you will be celebrating your 10 year anniversary with us?, we have something really nice for you\".  Not once was it mentioned that it was our anniversary.  As we left the restaurant the hostess finally said happy anniversary.  I wasn't expecting much but dont call me and say you have something special for me and then just give me crappy service. 

Like I said, the place is nice. Just avoid the bar and hope for good service."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch Review: 

Not sure I would have found this place if I wasn't with someone who knew where it was. I luhh the vibe of this place, but I just love wine bars in general. The wood/metal combo just does it for me. When you first walk in the space is narrow and features the bar area. Head towards the back and it expands to an open area with tables and booths. No need for ressies there was no wait.

I ordered the veggie omelette and it had ALL THE VEGGIES! It had bell peppers, zucchini squash, tomato, mushroom, swiss chard, AND spinach! Like how did they fit all of them in this omelette?! But really, the veggies tasted so fresh! Most likely one of the best omelette's I've had. So this AMAZEE omelette came with a large serving of breakfast potatoes. I am more of a well done type of girl when it comes to breakfast potatoes/home fries/hash browns. So these ones were not exactly my type, but I don't mind because it stopped me from eating all of them. Other orders at the table featured the pumpkin pancakes, & the V breakfast. Our server was pleasant & attentive so no complaints there.

Now for the most important part of brunch... the beverages. My table ordered a bottle of already mixed blood orange mimosa. Split between 4 people we each got 1.5 glasses of BOM and it came out to $8 per person. According to the other humans at my table the carafes don't have the IDEAL ratios. 

So if you are tight on ca$h money not sure this is the best place for a boozy brunch, but if you want a BOMB veggie omelette this is the place. 

Will return for dinner & wine."}
{"text":"Last night I was traveling a went to this very nice restaurant.  The from what I read chef was young and adventurous.  A graduate of probably on the top two culinary schools in the USA. Worked under an chef for  few years  before coming on here. I read the menu and  tasted several interesting dishes and some staples.  Eating here got me thinking about my years in on the line and in the kitchen.  I must say that I think many chefs are loosing sight of their mission to be creative and feed people amazing food.  This may not be an issue with the the chef a V Picasso but in my opinion he is overzealous in his use of one  too many ingredients.  I tried the crawfish raviolli. It was fantastic with one drawback the quantity of bold sausage was over powering the delicate flavors Raviolli. I also tried a fried lobster Ravioli, which was not breaded and fried but the pasta was fried. This was totally unnecessary and felt the pasta was tough. I had trouble cutting it with table knife.  The waitress said it had a quarter pound of lobster in it,  it was hard to tell with the creamy soft cheese inside.  I could see the lobster pieces but chewing through the fried firm pasta and cheese really detracted from the delicate sweet meat of the lobster.  I also have a charcuterie with manchego and Jamon Serrano. If a chef doesn't know the prosciutto or jamon needs to be sliced so thin that you can practically ses thru it,  then I really have to question his training. I'm saying this because what I got looked like a pile of thin slices but as I tried to pull a piece the whole pile came up in one lump and unraveled into one giant thick slice. When not cut thin parts can very tough. I also had the chocolate cremeux with berry soaked in red wine.  It was good but felt the red wine was over powering and a bit bitter.  A touch for flavor would have been good but I could no longer tell by taste.  I by am no means knocking each of his creations just thinking that how amazing it was but for very slight drawbacks.  Like a only a little sausage in the ravioli,  or don't saturated the fruit in the wine and definitely thin slice the jamon would have made it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience. Seated next to the only other table of customers inside. Wrong appetizer was served and sent back. Out of both wines on tap that we ordered, and \"Substitute along the same same line\" was six dollars a glass more. Burger and fries were excellent but the risotto was not good at all. Server was very personable but not very attentive (or very good) When the bill arrived, we were charged for the appetizer that was returned. However we weren't charged for a second glass of wine so we just called it even and left."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant in downtown Champaign. Not only is their food incredible, but their hospitality is second to none. If you want true farm to table food, this is the place to go. Also, if you are someone like me, who has special dietary needs, they are more than accommodating. I just went there for my birthday, and they special adapted their organic salmon and shrimp cocktail to meet my needs. Oh, then they went out of their way to get me dairy free milk for my coffee at the end.  Oh and if you want an awesome waiter to enhance the experience even more, ask for Moody :)"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! Service was excellent. The only problem was with dessert. We ordered the ricotta pound cake and it was rather dry and unappealing. The strawberries they had on the side were good, though scant."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We always have an incredible meal and the menu is fresh and new each time. The ingredients are farm to table whenever possible. They purchase their meats and produce from a family farm outside of Urbana. The food is seriously so good...you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"WOW.  I love this place!

I've been wanting to come here forever, but don't have a lot of people who are willing to try new places and new things with me.  I'm so pleased that I got the opportunity to visit last night.  The second we walked in, I loved the ambiance.  They had a little live music in the bar area that drifted into the dining room--so it wasn't too loud to talk and was just the perfect backdrop to a fun evening with a friend.  The pressed tin ceilings made the space feel warm and the eclectic art was well lit and positioned to draw interest.  

But enough about the building--let's get down to brass tacks and talk about food and wine.

You want an authentic local farm-to-table concept?  Go no further.  V. Picasso partners locally with Willow Creek Farm in Urbana and features Prairie Fruits Farms cheese on its menu as well.  They supplement with wonderful food items from around the world--they know an insane amount of information about where EXACTLY each food item is sourced and can tell you what makes it distinctive.  (Case in point:  One of their specials last night was a smoked venison osso buco that was described in incredible detail.  This place is serious about what they serve.)

VPicasso has an amazing wine list with eclectic selections around the world.  They also offer 'wine on tap' which sounds interesting.  Our awesome waiter, Trent, suggested a wonderful Montepulciano D'Abruzzo that was light and not super acidic.  It's totally a new fave.

Although the specials sounded AMAZING (osso buco?  you truly know the way to my heart, chef...) and the entrees looked fabulous (lobster ravioli? black cod? lamb shank?  risotto?) we weren't particularly hungry and wanted to just enjoy some of the wonderful cheese they offered.  (Major props to both the Manchego and the tangy Bohemian Blue)  The cheese board is served with fabulous honey from the farm, a yummy olive tapenade that was so good I thought we were going to get into a duel with our forks over it, and a jam in addition to lovely bread.  We ordered the roasted beet and arugula salad that had a perfect dressing on it that paired perfectly with the cheese we were eating (who knew!) and the shrimp toast.  It was fantastic.  Even though we were kinda full, it was too hard to resist the interesting desserts.  We landed on the chai funnel cake.  Seriously good.

And call me crazy, but half of what makes or breaks a restaurant for me is service.  The staff was super friendly and easy-going and tremendously knowledgeable and professional.  I'm kind of a service snob--there are servers who do the job for the tips and there are servers who have restaurant in their blood and are actually concerned about the experience their guests have.  Chef Adam hires VERY well.

So all in all, I'm more than pleased.  Don't you love Champaign?  Where else can you have all of this in the heart of your town?"}
{"text":"Update: Adam from V. Picasso contacted me after seeing this review and offered to make it up. He wanted my wife and I to come back in for dinner on their dime. I tried a few times to schedule but wasn't able to find a time that met my schedule. His offering was much appreciated though. 

My wife decided to make reservations last night for my birthday dinner with friends, and we had a wonderful evening. My ribeye was cooked perfectly and the marrow appraiser was like butter. Drinks were mixed well and the atmosphere and waiter were great. It made up for the mistake of NYE. 

It should be noted that I did not accept a free meal, nor did Adam or anyone else know I was returning. I contemplated contacting him, but felt I was over my bad experience and ready to move on. We will return. 


Original review:  My wife made dinner reservations online, a week in advance for NYE. We arrived about 10 minutes early and saw another couple just staring at the front door. We obviously asked them what was going on and they pointed to the front door where there was a sign stating that V. Picasso was closed for NYE due to a wedding. My jaw dropped as did my wife's. It's not like it was a regular old night, this was New Years Eve and again, we made reservations a week prior. The other couple just hung their heads low and walked off. 

I entered the business and spoke to the bartender and explained what had happened. The bartender was just as stunned as I was and did everything he could to apologize for the businesses error and after seeing how disappointed I was, handed me a gift certificate for $20. I thanked him for it, and for how he handled the situation and walked away. 

My wife and I tried Hamilton Walkers but their reservations were full as were several other restaurants in the area. Just when we thought our NYE date was over, Bacaro came to the rescue and was able to fit us in. We were very grateful four our NYE rescue. 

We have eaten at V. Picasso several times in the past with mixed reviews, but their NYE failure will be forever noted. I will give them one more chance since I have a gift certificate, and will go from there.  But I will never forget the unacceptable experience on NYE."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their farm-to-table approach. This place has a very nice atmosphere/decor and friendly staff. Both our server and the host checked on us multiple times throughout the meal and were cheerful and accommodating.

I tried the cherry smash cocktail but swapped the gin for vodka; really enjoyed it. The cheese plate is excellent, and ours was served with a pepper jelly that was fabulous. We had the manchego and a firm goat cheese. Both were delicious, though we favored the manchego. My mother-in-law got the eggplant dish, and she highly enjoyed it. My husband ordered the salmon with risotto and both of those were cooked perfectly. I had the steak and mashed potatoes. The potatoes were flavorful and served under the steak, which was a large ribeye that I couldn't finish. There were also some melted slices of Brie on the plate. 

The chocolate donut dessert was just okay for me. A little dry and chewy, for my taste. 

We definitely took home a doggy bag, as the portions are generous. Overall, wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"I would have given this 4 stars, but the service was absolutely the worst. I was there for brunch and ordered a pancake on the side. After asking for it 3 times, I gave up.

The waiter couldn't get the checks separated correctly, even after we wrote down who got what. My drink ended up on somebody else's check. The waiter kept apologizing, but apologies only go so far. I paid cash and tipped against my better judgement, but it was only to get away from the table because I was so mad."}
{"text":"V. Picasso is a fast favorite. I love to celebrate special occasions here over dinner! I also love the restaurant's partnership with Willow Creek Farm. 

We celebrated a birthday here this past year and called to make a reservation in the evening in case it was busy. We mentioned what we were celebrating and, when we arrived, the table had been set with two glasses of champagne. It was such a thoughtful and lovely gesture. We enjoyed steamed mussels, fried avocado, mushroom ravioli, and lamb chop. Everything was beautifully plated and so delicious!

We have also frequented here for brunch. The lemon poppyseed french toast is amazing, as is the fried chicken and chilaquilles!

I would recommend placing a reservation on busier holidays (such as Mother's Day, graduation, etc.), but the wait time is not too awful if you're willing to sit in the bar area."}
{"text":"Would call it a bit of work in progress, but hey it's only been a couple of months and they just went to a whole new menu.  First the food is interesting (always one of my highest criteria).  Two of us chose the \"cured dish of the day\", fried green tomatoes, quail entree and duck entree.  There was a bit of southern Americana bent.  

Of the dishes, the cured fish was a bust from my point of view.  Wonderfully cured salmon, served with paprika whole grain mustard, tapinade, moderately spicy grilled peppers and grilled baguette.  If you put it all together the salmon is lost in the mix.  Don't know what it all had to do with each other but....

Fried green tomatoes were wonderful not much more to say.  The quail was stuffed with a rhubarb. The quail was nicely cooked but as a matter of personal taste didn't like the stuffing.  Duck was wonderfully cooked over a corn risotto.

Wines by the glass was a high point.  A bit pricey, but they had probably 20 wines by the glass or even for small tasting pours.  Choices were interesting.  We decided for wine pairings by the glass vs a bottle and were quite happy.

So I think as the restaurant matures a bit it will be well worth it."}
{"text":"V Picasso has an okay wine selection, but I was honestly expecting more interesting choices given that this place touts itself as a wine bar. The menu is not particularly vegetarian friendly, so keep that in mind if you're a more herbivorous diner. Servers here often seem a little uncomfortable, but never rude. The patio is lovely for drinks and hors d'oeuvres on warm summer evenings. Worth a shot if you're looking for a semi-fancy place to hang out."}
{"text":"It is not the same as their last location with this name by the same owners. They had some items that you won't know how much or what the are. If you are going for that I would think you would have a menu easy and cost effective to change day to day. Kind of strange having the doors to the jewelry store open. I can't see this location bee ing open long either."}
{"text":"Had brunch here today and had a fantastic experience. Our waitress was friendly, bubbly, and just the right amount of attentive. The rustic interior creates a cool vibe and the food did not disappoint. 

I ordered the steak omelet and although the steak was a bit more done and chewy than I normally prefer, it was still a great meal. The side potatoes were particularly noteworthy, very large pieces with a crispy outer layer and soft core. Someone else in my group ordered the mushroom omelet and it tasted fantastic. The final dish in our group was challah French toast, which had an amazing lemon curd coating. All very filling and very worth the price. 5/5"}
{"text":"Brunch: Excellent, maybe the best in town
Dinner: Good

I would absolutely return for brunch. I ordered the fried green tomato breakfast sandwich and it was delicious and a huge portion. I went with a large party of 20 and everyone enjoyed their food.

Went for dinner on Valentine's Day this year for the first time and it was good. We got a few appetizers, the charcuterie board which is always a safe bet and the lox which was not anything special. I ordered the scallops for dinner and I liked it. More upscale so the dinner portions were smaller and it was expensive. 

A nice date spot with a great interior, but I am more likely to come back for brunch than dinner."}
{"text":"Just had a fantastic Sunday brunch with friends.  Great mimosas, bloody mary's, eggs Benedict, steak and eggs and biscuits and gravy!  Server \" Moody\" was definitely NOT Moody!  Very pleasant experience!  Kudos to management!!!!"}
{"text":"The brunch here is amazing. I have been several times out and gotten different dishes each time. The last time I got a salad dish that was delicious. The yolk on the egg that I asked to be over easy was very runny just how I like it.
 However my favorite part about brunch is the drinks!! I always go with other people and the $20 bottle of champagne with your choice of juice is a real steel. We always get several and you can't go wrong with either the fresh orange juice or fresh grapefruit juice. It is never very busy when I have been but our service was still amazing and I would guess it would be even if it were busy. I'll have to go some other time other than brunch to check out what they have. But in the meantime I can highly recommend brunch here on the weekends."}
{"text":"We have an awesome experience every time we go to V. Picasso. Several times it's been a celebration, and the food has been incredible. For my birthday the waiter brought me a free glass of champagne, which felt very special. Sometimes it's just drinks or dessert at the bar, and we're still treated very well. Our servers and bartenders are knowledgeable, friendly, and generous. No, it's not the cheapest, but it's well worth it. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The summer menu is great!! We were sitting outside and had amazing time!! The mussles and the fried oyster is just delicious!! Great!! Will come back again :) Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Swanky, upscale, and hip. It's undoubtedly expensive, but the food was absolutely delicious. The smoked salmon starter tasted amazing with the caviar, and the potato blinis complemented the dish nicely. For the entree, I had pan-roasted seabass, which was cooked perfectly. I also had a glass of Jean-Marc Borchard, a chablis wine; although there were a lot of chardonnays to choose from, too. Overall, a 5-star experience."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday with a group of 10 and we all loved it.  I had eggplant parm. and it was so flavorful I was talking about how good it was all night.  They didn't have a kids menu but were willing to create a small pasta dish for my 3 year old.   They didn't have milk for him either, but had a very good lemonade that he liked.  Others in our party had a fillet, pork belly, salmon, and fried chicken and all reported that the food was excellent.  The service and presentation were very good also.  We enjoyed our night. Food tasted very fresh. Atmosphere was nice too! We will be back."}
{"text":"This place certainly tries hard to please and it's a bit of an uneven experience that offered more highs than lows.  It's got a really cool vibe inside, contemporary gothic, and a farm-to-table mantra that seems authentic.  The beverage program features trendy wines on tap which are an excellent value.  There are standard starters and entrees and a seasonal menu featuring more starters and entrees.  My large group got to try a number of items.  We did not have dessert.

Good:
French Onion soup - decent.
Fried oysters - Delicious!  These are not on the menu but are apparently always available.  Fresh oysters are on the menu but were not available that night.
Deviled egg with crispy pork belly and pickled cucumber - ok, but why not just say bacon and pickles?  I see, for $2 each, it's crispy pork belly and pickled cucumber!
Chef's market steak (NY strip) - nicely prepared.
Cedar planked salmon - good, not great.
Fried brussels sprouts, spiced maple aioli - tasty.

Not so good:
Butternut squash bisque with maple foam and roasted butternut squash seeds - soup was good but the squash seeds weren't husked so they were chewy and bitter.  Would have been much better to just use roasted and husked pumpkin seeds.
Slow roasted pork belly - the meat was tough and the cornbread stuffing was cold.
Mushroom bolognese - this dish was strangely light (as in not hearty) and was not served with any grated cheese and when we asked for some, it took so long to get it the dish had become cold.

Service was great up front but then became scarce.  Where were you in our time of grated cheese need?"}
{"text":"I felt like I was back in downtown Austin, TX or dining off of Randolph Street in Chicago, IL. This restaurant brings major city dining, service and ambiance to a small college town. 

Ambiance - The entire experience was spot on. From the moment we walked in, we were pleasantly surprised by the attention to decor details. Backlit stained glass windows, wine bar with lounge, reclaimed wood on walls, \"edison\" bulb lighting, short mason jars with candles on tables. It felt great being in the space. 

Getting a table - The hostess was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. Took down our number to call us when the table was ready. Said it would take 30-40 minutes, told us the group sizes ahead of us. 40 minutes later phone rang and our table was ready. We arrived around 7 - 7:30pm. They were getting ready to do their second seating. If you aren't going to arrive by 6, consider arriving between 7:30 - 8:30pm as things appeared to clear out a bit by then. 

Seating - We sat in a booth, which I love doing so I can sit next to my husband. There are a limited QTY of booths, thus if this is your preference you should consider putting in that request with a hostess early. If weather is nice, they have a lot of outdoor tables on Neil Street. Bonus - when Cowboy Monkey has bands playing (around the corner), you can get music for free!

Service - I don't know if all waiters that work here are as talented and knowledgeable as ours, but as a previous server at a high-end restaurant while in college - wow! He was attentive, well-spoken, knew the menu inside and out (props to the chef for letting your servers try everything - it makes a big difference), and was super knowledgeable about wines (we are not). My husband had ordered a malbec, enjoyed it, and put in an order for another. The server told him he should really try another one by the glass and that he'd like it more -- which he did and was pleasantly surprised. 

Food - We were so pleased by our meal. For a starter, we ordered 12 month manchego cheese with 15 month-aged jamon (ham). It comes out on a butchers block serving tray with an assortment of warm and soft bread slices, date chutney, several hot peppers and an olive tapenade. Yum! We then put in an order for foccacia bread with chicken sausage on top and fennel. It's perfectly bite-sized sliced and great for sharing. For entries, we ordered shrimp with pork belly over grits. The second entrée was scallops with crispy proscuito over perfectly tender potatoes. 

Management - The chef circled around to tables twice to visit personally with everyone. He was very gracious and attentive. Nice gesture!

Props - It is also worth noting, they've only been open 2 weeks! The amount of work it requires to have a beautiful space, menu hammered out, well-trained and lovely staff and to provide a great dining experience so soon after opening is impressive. We were truly delighted with our meal and surprised / thankful to have a restaurant of this nature in Champaign!  

Final Tips: 
1. Put in your name and if it is crowded, go next door to Blind Pig Brewery or Quality for a pint. 
2. Request a booth as they are more private against the walls. 
3. Focaccia bread dishes are great for sharing. 
4. Entres run around $18-$25. Plenty of options for wine by the glass and tapas too. 
5. Don't be in a  rush. This is not churn tables out kind of restaurant. It is slower-paced and a relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'll be brief. The restaurant wasn't that busy for a Saturday night, but that didn't stop our waiter from being exceptionally distracted. It took a long time to even put a drink order in, and an even longer time to have the drinks delivered. The same went for our appetizers. 
I will say that the wine, cheese plate, and oysters tasted very good. 
When our waiter finally got around to taking our entrée order, the food came out in a fair time.  The problem was that the waiter took our silverware and did not replace it for several minutes while the food got cold.
My order of a rabbit pasta with greens was so salty I couldn't eat it. The waiter replaced the order with a scallop plate, that was also extremely salty. I gave up at this point. 
When the check came, it was incorrect and had to be sent back as well. 
I don't mind paying $100 for a meal, but not for food and service like this."}
{"text":"Had an incredible dinner here! Definitely get the steak - it came with a hefty helping of delicious mashed potatoes, so you definitely get your money's worth. My mom got the salmon, and my dad got the scallops. Everything was cooked so perfectly!

Great, attentive service. The interior is large, clean, and modern. There is also plenty of outside seating. This is the perfect place to bring your parents or friends from out of town!"}
{"text":"I noticed.. there is a new bar in downtown Champaign.  I visit Shampoo Banana periodically and have learned to always stay downtown... easy to get to restaurants after a long day of whatever you're doing in the city.

Finally a wine bar!  I like that...  Blind pig is fun too but there is no wine.  And now there is no Boltinis.. it's a good addition.

The wine wasn't awesome but it was definitely at city prices.. which makes me kind of roll my eyes.  We are still in Champaign.

It's broken up into two rooms.  Seems more of a restaurant than a bar really.  Didn't try the food.. and there was a jazz band singing a tortured version of Beyoncé's song..."}
{"text":"I always just sit at the bar, so I can't speak for the service from the wait staff, but the bartenders are always awesome. It's a little pricey, but the food is good and if you just want drinks and something small it's not going to hurt your wallet too much."}
{"text":"Outstanding in every way! Beautiful space, food and wine were spectacular, and service at the bar with Jake was wonderful and very knowledgeable. Yelpers and staff were right - the seabass is incredible!  Great wine list, including a lot of options by the glass that you won't see anywhere else. Also right down the street from the Hyatt, so a perfect choice for business travelers. Will definitely return on my next visit!"}
{"text":"One of my last weekends in Champaign before coming home, I took my lovely girlfriend here for a nice going-away dinner.

We made reservations but the place was pretty much empty on a Friday night in June, although many people were sitting outside.

We sat inside and the décor of the restaurant is really nice, kind of a modern but rustic feel and slightly upscale.

V Picasso prides itself on quality food and wine, much of that coming from a local Urbana farm, which is awesome! I am a big fan of the farm-to-table concept.

We began with the lamb meatball appetizer and a couple glasses of wine, my girlfriend had a moscato which she absolutely loved, and I had a Spanish red of the Rioja variety (I think). Both were good. The lamb appetizer was delicious, the meat almost melted in our mouths and the tomato sauce was also tasty.

For our main plates, my girlfriend had the seafood pasta, which was a pappardelle-style ribbon noodle with a mix of crab, lobster and clam (I think). She really liked it. I had the lobster roll with homemade chips. This was pretty good, but not exceptional. Also a little small as far as portion size goes in my opinion, at least for the lobster roll, which was nearly $30.

Service was good, I forget our server's name but he knew his stuff and was very nice to us. 

Overall, quality food and wine in a sweet atmosphere, but small portions at kind of steep prices. Still a very good option for quality, unique food in downtown Champaign."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend for Valentine's Day.  We had the sampler with wine pairings, and overall it was a good fine dining experience.  The wait staff was very courteous, and even moved us to a different table when ours was a bit wobbly.  However, they are serious when they mean \"samplers\", in which I finished the sampler and was still hungry.  Also it was super expensive! The food was great nonetheless and the presentation was meticulous.   We ordered the steak, which was huge and that filled me up.  I may try V Picasso on a different, non-holiday date when the prices aren't astronomical and the portions are larger."}
{"text":"It was a girls' night out. We each had salmon, meatloaf, pork shank, and duck and tasted each other's dish a bit. They all were fresh and really good. The balance between the main (protein) and garnish was very nice - nothing creative but still good.

The service was good, too. Our glasses were always full. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"First time here and it looked pretty fancy for Champaign (the rest of downtown is pretty much jeans and boots culture). It wasn't busy at all on a Friday night around 9 and we came for small plates and drinks. I love the decor here, rustic wood meets mosaics and  stained glass with these really cool round light fixtures. I always give points to anyplace that takes time to create ambiance in our little bar town. Anyway, we had a super nice server named Ryan who suggested some good drinks. Ever since Boltini (RIP) closed, I've been searching for a good cocktail in this town. Hoping for a miracle, I tried two cocktails here. I'm happy to report the standout was the Martinez. It was flavorful without overpowering the palette with that gin tanginess. It does pack quite the wallop so make sure you're eating too. We also sampled some cheese and meats with the best being The \"Spanish\" variety: jamon Serrano and the manchego. I also tried the salmon flat bread which was red wine cured salmon with dill cream. It was perfectly light and left you with room for drinks. For a larger dining space, the noise was a low din. I'm pretty sure we were the loudest people there. This place is on the pricey side compared to the other restaurants in the area (my salmon and 2 cocktails was 25 or so) but it is well worth it. I'm looking forward to coming back on a date or just to try more cocktails!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time this weekend for brunch. Ordered the eggs Benedict and a mimosa! The breakfast potatoes are cooked perfectly! Might be one of the best potatoes I've had. 
They have mimosas for $4 a glass or you can go unlimited for $10!
The ambience is rustic and relaxing, perfect spot for brunch with friends and for date night!
Can't wait to go back and for dinner and maybe check out their wine bar!"}
{"text":"Service was good but the food was under seasoned, specifically under salted. The braised lamb shank had great texture, but lacked flavor."}
{"text":"I love this place. Service CANNOT be better. Moody is awesome. It is a little pricey, but not crazy bad. We went for drinks and apps last night - going back for dinner tonight. We sat outside even though it was a little warm. I really like the vibe of this place. It is nice but not pretentious. We went late last night and it wasn't busy. We did not have a reservation - just went on a whim. Early dinner reservations tonight."}
{"text":"My sister and I headed to V. Picasso for a sisters night out when I was home in Champaign this month. We really wanted to sit inside and enjoy the great interior decor (it's really clever and well done!) but the AC was on full blast and it was just too cold. Brrrrr! We sat outside instead and so lost some of the ambience.

The service was terrific / our server was a young woman who knew her food service stuff well. We were impressed! I've lost the note with her name it she'd get kudos.

Drinks were well made and food was yummy. Next time I'm bringing a sweater so I can give this place the five stars it deserves."}
{"text":"A beautiful dining experience in a superb location in downtown Champaign...from the tin ceilings and the wine barrel ring lights to the repurposed barn-wood walls and cathedral stain glass windows...this all sets the perfect surrounding to compliment with the \"which item on the menu do I order!?\" 
So far you CAN'T go wrong with any thing that lists Pork Belly...crisp and BACONY!! 
The Salmon is of a generous portion cooked to perfection! No flaws in any of the culinary skills that go on in the kitchen...can't wait for my next visit again, and again!"}
{"text":"A co-worker and I ordered some brunch to go. When we got back to work and sat down to eat we noticed some things on our order were not correct. I called back to ask how it could be resolved. The staff was super helpful and eager to fix the issue. The manager offered to walk a new order over to us so we wouldn't be inconvenienced. They brought us  our corrected order extremely quickly and were genuinely apologetic. We appreciated that so much! We know if we go to V. Picasso we will be taken care of and we will be happy to eat there again in the future, everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"You go there for the wine and you stay for the Elijah. Super nice bartender. Good food as well. Nice ambiance as well. Cool little lounge area too. Will be back"}
{"text":"I don't make it back to Champaign very often, but V. Picasso has been a real treat to discover. Along with a great waitstaff, Champaign finally has a selection (albeit different) of wines to keep up with the quality of Bacaro.  Throw Josh in there with his incredible knowledge and inviting personality (honestly he's what's kept me coming back), and you have a restaurant that has shown up to compete.  Color me impressed."}
{"text":"This is an overall nice place to go to if you're looking for something fancier in Chambana. They serve classier takes on traditional American dishes and charge a premium for the nicer plating and everything. In my opinion the food's not worth the price. I've had the eggplant parmesan, duck pasta, and beef tartare. Eggplant parmesan doesn't come with any carbs and the salad underneath it doesn't absorb a lot of the oil that comes from it. It has a nice velvety texture though. Beef tartare has a good flavor but there's not a lot of bread that comes with it. The pasta I had was SALTY and made me really thirsty. I've also had a moscow mule, peach jazz, and king's ginger tonic. The moscow mule was good and was really refreshing. The peach jazz and king's ginger tonic had A LOT of alcohol and overwhelmed me a bit, but it's good for the price."}
{"text":"The decor and ambience was great from the minute we walked in! The staff was very nice and informative.  We had the Pork Belly over Avocado Grits and The Lamb Shenk over Lemon Risotto.  Both of these dishes were done perfectly and good portions.  For dessert we had the Butternut Squash Cake, very good and moist!  Loved the sourcing of produce and meats from the local farm Willow Creek.  Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Went to V Picasso last night to try their new menu.  Loved it, as did my friends.  We each got something different.  I love raw oysters, but I thought I'd try the fried oysters last night.  Oh my!  I will probably never get the raw ones again as long as the fried are on the menu.  In addition I tried a scallop wrapped in bacon.  Delish.  For dinner I had the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and greens.  The mashed potatoes were absolutely the best.  I will also admit that I am not a greens fan, but V Picasso makes the best greens I've ever eaten.  I now crave them. Another thing about V PIcasso's chicken...it is the most tender chicken I have ever eaten.  I have chicken there several times and each time it is so amazingly tender.  I suspect it is due to their local farmer's free range approach.  That and the freshness.  Oh, and how could I forget the dessert.  Panna Cotta w/a pink peppercorn syrup.  Not something I would think goes together, but it absolutely does.  Many thanks to V Picasso for yet another great meal."}
{"text":"The food here is very refined, flavors are balanced.  Service was friendly and at the right pace... if not a little bit too much service..
I guess it was a new menu but all 3 dishes we tried were very good.  I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"It's the little things that make places bad or good or even great. Big things matter, but if you don't have the finishing touches down you are just going to be average. It doesn't matter how well a wall is painted if there's little spots of paint on the trim. 99% of a mirror can be clean, but the one thumb print is the thing that you'll notice. 
V Picasso has the nicest bathroom I've ever seen! Pushing open the ornate wooden door leads you into a place that I felt guilty urinating in. I saw this piece of art on the wall, that made me feel bad for pissing in. The ceilings looked as though they were covered in ornate copper. The sink made me feel bad for having sullied my hands. I can't imagine taking a poop in here, because the door that you shut in the stall is a miniature version of the bathroom door. This must be how kings poop! It's not some fake imitation wood either, or plastic molded to look like wood, this door is heavy and it's artfully crafted. The room was spotless as well. When you care that much about how the friggin bathroom looks, you will definitely be in for a treat for the other things... you know, like the food. 
When I came in, I was offered the food and drink menu. It was my first time here, and I don't think any of the wait staff knew me. I looked at the draft selection, which didn't make a difference to me because it's all wine, and then looked at the bottles in front of me. I decided on a St. Bernadus Abt. 12. An excellent beer. They have others, not too many, probably about a dozen to choose from, ranging from Bud Light, up to the St.B 12. Most of the beers were either 4,5 or 7 bucks. Which isn't horrible. They had Triptych Can listed on the menu, but Triptych won't be canning again until the new canning line comes on. Initially I wasn't sure of what to eat. I thought back to a Smile Politely article from a couple of months ago about how to be a man (or something similar), and it recommended \"get the special\". I asked what the special was, and it sounded great, even though I have no idea the words that he said. When I found out it was some sort of fish... I went with the steak. (probably pictured below). I asked \"who was in the kitchen\" and the bartender said \"Eric M\". So, I ordered the steak rare. \"Eric M\" was just out of the kitchen moments before surveying the crowd before I got there (the crowd of 1 table), and so when an order for a steak rare printed out, he came out of the kitchen to see who the new person was. He smiled as he came over, and told me \"heck, it's probably done already for you virgil\". It was served with a Brussels sprouts and potato cubes in a cream sauce, with some red peppers on top. Cooked excellent, lightly seasoned. It was a big ass T-bone. As I ate, Mookie and I told stories of everything to the giant bartender. Gabe was also in the kitchen. It's a radio reunion kitchen. Executive Chef Adam, Mookie, Gabe... the good times are here. For some reason I was still hungry after the big ass steak, (probably because I didn't pick it up and chew on the bone like I would of were I at the house, (they told me it was ok to do so, as I pretty much had the place to myself) but I didn't, not because I didn't want to be \"that guy\" at the restaurant, so much as I would have needed a shower to get all of the juices and sauces out of my beard) so I asked for a recommendation, Mooke offered a couple of items, until we both settled on the scotch egg. Which is possibly the greatest invention ever. A local egg (not sure which farm), that's basically turned into a deviled egg, and wrapped in sausage. I could probably go broke eating those. 
Basically, if you want to eat like a king, and do your bodily functions in a room thats nicer than anything in your house, go to V Picasso."}
{"text":"I have been to V. Picasso 2 times, once on my birthday and another on my wedding anniversary. My experience on my birthday was nice. We had ordered mussels and crab cakes for appetizers and quail and scallops for mains. All dishes were nice, although mussels were overcooked. After this, we decided to give it another try on our anniversary. Service as usual was very nice. We ordered shrimp toast for appetizer and lamb shank and duck for the mains. Shrimp toast was just ok. My husband did not like it at all. Hence, our all hopes were on mains. Lamb shank was fine but it did not have any freshness of vegetables or salads to cut the richness of dish. On the other hand, duck had some freshness but was overcooked. Overall, it was just an ok experience. My overall ratings are below:

Shrimp toast: 5/10
Lamb shank: 6/10
Duck: 6/10

They have changed their menu since we first went there. I will only try it again if they add more seafood selection and also accompany their dishes with some salad to cleanse the palate."}
{"text":"New chef and management has made a complete difference.  I had the lamb with a french onion soup. Super delicious with great drinks."}
{"text":"So I was in the mood for oysters and I had a pretty dude in tow, so I went to Picasso and then returned again. Yeah, oysters were fresh (but I am not a fan of corn on them), the rest of the food was great.  

Go to the bartender and have him make you a drink. (You're welcome). 

Service was on point.  The two additional times I have gone I wasn't disappointed. I guess my first review was an anomaly."}
{"text":"Salmon was excellent! Loved the ambiance. Only comment is that I wish there had been more vegetarian options on the menu as there were a few in my group."}
{"text":"This was an amazing restaurant--definitely the best we've had in Champaign/Urbana. My wife and I went there for our 5th wedding anniversary and it didn't disappoint. Our waitress Alexa really made the evening with some amazing suggestions, including my wife getting scallops, which were phenomenal. The oysters were also delicious. 

It is an expensive restaurant, so we won't be heading there on a random Tuesday, but it will definitely be our top pick for future special occasions."}
