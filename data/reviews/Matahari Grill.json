{"text":"I grew up in singapore, so im always looking for good south east asian food and matahari grill really hits the spot. started with the grilled eggplant appetizer which was grilled to perfection and seasoned with spices. i really recommend ordering it. then we had the char kway teow, which was tasty, and the beef rendang, which was subliminal. the meat fell off the bone and  seasoned perfectly. caught a glimpse of another tables cashew chicken and it looked deadly, covered with dried chillies, so i know what im ordering next time im back. service was good if not a little hectic. this restaurant would have gotten 5 stars if only the prices were the same as back home, but i think im asking to much."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves mediocre food with VERY sloooww service! They need to hire more waiters or find new ones who are more attentive to customers. Had to wait almost 10 minutes before being seated when clearly the restaurant was not even packed. Appetizers (shrimp satay & clam satay) took awhile to arrive, I would say about 20 minutes which tasted okay, not bad. The main dish I ordered was the Malaysian Chicken Curry with their crispy roti and coconut rice. I thought the curry was a bit on the salty side but maybe some people like that, I was able to side sweep the saltiness by eating the curry together with my rice and drinking alot of water! ( a little spicy). I Ended the night with desserts which were the highlight of my night. Though it almost took another 20 minutes to arrive, I really enjoyed the Penang Crepe and Durian Ice Cream. Yum! But when asked for the bill it took forever to receive! I just think this kind of service is unacceptable no matter how good the food is. this really ruined my night. I would say that, only come to this restaurant if you have a lot of time on your hands."}
{"text":"Get the rendang beef and DEFINITELY the pandan crepe for dessert"}
{"text":"This restaurant is clean, the service is very professional, and the food is good. I had the mango chicken and I recommend it."}
{"text":"Ate here one night while looking for Indonesian cuisine. We sat right down at 8 on a Saturday night during the summer- it wasn't busy at all. There only appeared to be 1 server, so it took her a while to get us water and come back and take our orders, but she was pleasant. She was not too knowledgable about certain menu items and answering questions, but she was able to find out from the kitchen staff. 

We ordered chicken satay with peanut sauce for an app. Very tasty and delicious. My boyfriend ordered Nyonya Lamb for dinner with a side of the coconut rice. He really liked it, but I am not crazy about lamb. The flavor of the sauce was very good though, soy sauce based with chili pepper and lemongrass. I ordered Curry Laksa, curry based sauce with lots of noodles, chicken, tofu, and a few bean sprouts. A little spicy too. Excellent flavor!

My only gripe was that it was sauna-hot in the place, as it was a 90 degree day and high humidity, and the restaurant did not seem to have any AC running. We ate our food very slowly because it was so hot inside, we were sweating during dinner, and mine was a little spicy.  

It's a quiet place and we could easily hear other conversations going on next to us, but they had pleasant music playing in the background to muffle out the voices a little. 

Would come here again!"}
{"text":"Let me first clear that the food here is great. There was not a single complaint from the large group of 15 coworkers I was with. A little on the spicy side for some, but certainly authentic Malaysian. 

What irked me about this experience though was the incredibly long wait to have our orders taken (30 minutes), and then the even longer wait for our food to arrive (~ 50 mins). And this is with reservations made 2 days in advance.

While our waiter was apologetic throughout the lunch, and assured us on several occasions that our orders were on their way, they simply took their sweet time to arrive. One of my coworkers even left before the food arrived to catch a meeting! Having learned this, the waiter didn't even offer her meal for free. Not cool.

Admittedly, this place gets incredibly busy during lunch, almost on a daily basis. Considering this, I would think that the owners of this establishment would either 1) hire more staff in the kitchen, or 2) not accept reservations from large parties. 

After this lunch, I learned from others that they had similar experiences of insanely long waits. Clearly, the owners of this establishment have no intention of  1) hiring more staff in the kitchen, and 2) not accepting reservations from large parties."}
{"text":"The services was poor.  The dishes doesn't taste ethnic Malaysian.  There are better ethnic Malaysian restaurants out there.  The service could be better.  The place is dark. It look closed from the outside.  The place does not taste the same since the owner changed. They were true Malaysians."}
{"text":"The food here is so good! 
I ordered Char Kway Teow, satays and chicken curry. Truly Malaysian food with great flavours! I've been there twice and will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"3.5/5. Recommend the Rendang beef and Matahari seafood curry grill. Avoid the noodle dishes."}
{"text":"1. Food taste good, 2. Slow service, 3. Way over-priced

Conclusion: not reasonable for what you pay. Not going back."}
{"text":"Had the Nasi Lemak and Spring Rolls.

That DRIED ANCHOVY STIR FRY that comes with the Nasi Lemak!!! It's freaking gorgeous. Texture and flavour explosion in your mouth. The other components of the dish? Nothing notable. Spring Rolls were okay. Tasted like most spring rolls I've had before, though there were some super crunchy veggies inside. 

Given the lack of Malay cuisine near Toronto's downtown core, this place is worth a go. Just note they have really terrible lighting."}
{"text":"Went here with a Malaysian friend who told me that this was the most authentic Malay place in Toronto. Only had dessert this time, but  I intend to go back for a full meal as the menu and foods look great. Have a small patio and the place was hopping on a Thurday, Summer evening."}
{"text":"I think Matahari earned a 3.5 - 4 rating overall for me.

We had a craving for Indonesian food, left by our honeymoon earlier this year.  We recently stopped at a nice place in NYC, and thought it was time to give Matahari a try for something close to home.

To recapture our adventures, we ordered Mee Goreng and Nasi Goreng.  this was the first time we have had it that they were vastly different, usually there's a few differences, but they still had a similar vibe.  The Nasi Goreng (rice) was good basic fare, and was pretty much in keeping with what we had all over Indonesia.  The Mee Goreng (noodles), however, was in a much spicier kind of Thai chili/BBQ sauce.  It was quite tasty, if not what we were expecting.  Going back to the Nasi Goring left it a little bland in comparison, but it was a nice contrast regardless.

The service was good, no complaints there.  The restaurant itself could possibly use some upgrades, most notably in the washroom area, but I won't hold that against it.   The prices might be a little high, but compared to what?  If the only other place I can get decent Nasi Goreng is a 40 minute drive away, that puts it in perspective and I'll gladly pay the extra couple of dollars.  As far as I'm aware there isn't anywhere in the city to get pure Indonesian these days anyway, so this blend of Indo and Malay(?) will fit the bill.

Overall a good dinner out, and a good experience."}

{"text":"I came here for their Winterlicious 2016 lunch menu. I arrived at a busy and noisier time, but it quieted at around 1pm. The soup I ordered was too sour for my taste. However, I did enjoy the spicy curry, which I found too spicy later, but no worries if you have a higher tolerance for spicy food. I do wish that they put more vegetables to counter the spiciness. The waiters were very nice and friendly...but they sometimes left my friend and I hanging (as they temporarily got distracted and forgot about it; but, one time thing so all is forgiven)."}
{"text":"I've been going to Matahari for a few years for its laksa soup which is the best laksa in Toronto/the best I've ever had anywhere.You can get it \"vegetarian\" (thee base is still a shrimp paste..) with tofu and veggies. 

The Nasi Lemak is also DELICIOUS. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the anchovy dish is SO good and I've never found anything else like it in Toronto. 

Definitely order the coconut rice if it doesn't come with your order- it is fantastic. The appetizer combo platter is also a good sampler. 

The only reason why I didn't choose 5 stars is because the last time I was there a few days ago, the food didn't come out piping hot as I would have liked, and the first dish I ordered (a vegetarian tempeh dish) wasn't available! (?!?!)

I go to Baldwin for Gateways of India and Matahari..but now since Gateways has closed, Matahari is definitely the best spot."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant on Baldwin. The service is quick and efficient, and the food is so flavourful - it's surprising I don't eat here all the time! There's really nothing I don't like about this little place.
On most of my trips here I've ordered the Casbah Cashew Chicken (sub veggies and tofu for chicken). They are generous with the cashews and the portion sizes do not disappoint. The dish comes with rice, but I always upgrade to coconut rice. There's always enough food left over for me to eat later in the day which makes me so happy because I can't get enough of the wonderful flavours they're able to pack into one plate. I once ordered the green tea ice cream for dessert, but the server was suggesting the Pandan Crepe because he was sure I would like it (I really come here a LOT!). I wasn't feeling particularly adventurous so I decided to go with the ice cream anyway. But when he brought out the dessert, he brought both (no charge for the Pandan Crepe) because he really wanted me to try it. I was so glad he did! Because it was delicious...YUMM! I just ate here yesterday and now I'm craving it again. Can't wait for next time :)"}
{"text":"We had an overpriced but okay meal here. The Beef Rendang, the purpose of our trip, was wonderful and enough to take home to munch on all weekend.  The roti and the rice was good.  The soup with chicken and tofu had no flavour or depth, and the seafood curry also lacked any true depth of flavour.  For $75.00 it was not worth it. I'd recommend getting the beef rendang to go and skipping the rest.

Also I come from a queer parent family:  To the two elderly women having the loudest and rudest relationship fight, you ruined my dinner.  Please be courteous to other diners and keep your fights at home or at least in hushed tones.  It went on and on and we eventually just packed up our half eaten food and left.  

I asked the server to turn on music to muffle the sound, but he didn't."}
{"text":"Matahari Grill gets a 3.5 for me. I've been here a couple of times, a few years apart but I definitely intend on returning much sooner. My first time dining here was at lunch on a weekday and second was during dinner. Both were very different experiences ambiance and service-wise. Service at lunch was fast as it was busy. Dinner service (it was a Friday night) was rather slow, though we were there for a special occasion and rather enjoyed the low lighting the relaxed vibe. Definitely though, there is a lack of consistency with the level of service. 

As for the food, I've enjoyed pretty much everything I have ever ordered here. I've had their spicy eggplant appetizer and their famous beef rendang during both visits and both times have enjoyed them immensely. I'm a creature of habit and have a difficult time veering from menu favourites but have made a conscious effort to try some of the other menu items next time. While the crepe dessert is so-so. it's hard to pass up as the sweet pandan leaf flavour nicely rounds out your meal. 

Matahari ranks as a fave for me when it comes to restaurants that serve South East Asian cuisine here in Toronto (not that my list is very extensive though, to begin with). If their service improved, I'd definitely be there more often and recommending it a bit more to friends."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

We had a group of five and ordered an appetizer to share, beef rendang, a vegetable dish and some noodles. I can't recall the exact name of each dish but they were certainly tasty with a nice mix of sweet  and spicy.

I liked the sago sago dessert which had coconut milk and tapioca. Fav dishes were probably the shrimp chips dipped in peanut satay (as a part of the appetizer platter) and  the beef rendang which was stewed in texture and tender.

The bill totalled about $40 each which was a bit surprising. Most of the dishes are $10-20, so it can add up. Doubt it was worth the price but it was a solid meal."}
{"text":"Went to Matahari Grill for lunch and I'm torn between giving 3 and 4 stars, so I guess I'd say it's a 3.5.  The food is good for Toronto Malaysian food - I'd say slightly better than Restoran Malaysia in Richmond Hill - but I still find it a bit expensive for what you're getting (lunch entrees for around $12+tax+tip) and the service was slow, particularly for lunch time. We ended up taking 1.5 hours for three people at a 1pm lunch.  Our server also wasn't particularly professional; we had a hard time understanding him and he often left our table with us wondering if we were going to get our water, or exactly what was in a certain dish, etc. Food-wise, we tried some different curries and the nasi lamek, which all seemed authentic and tasted good.

Things that would make Matahari Grill a definite four star: if it was either cheaper, had better service, or if the food was better (obv - that would make it five star!). As it stands, Matahari Grill is like eating overpriced fast food at table-clothed tables. That being said, it was good enough that I would return at least once more, particularly to check out the beef rendang for dinner because it's not on their lunch menu."}
{"text":"Me and my friends came here for Winterlicious. The prawn soup was a bit watery and sour, my entree arrived cold (and had to be reheated), and the dessert was underwhelming. Left full, but a bit disappointed and no intention of returning."}
{"text":"It used to be good. WHAT HAPPENED?

Long story short, take the trek up to Restoran Malaysia instead.

 It will be a longer drive, and perhaps WAY out of your way (you will need a car, no TTC), but it is TRUE Malaysian fare for cheaper!!!!!

http://www.restoranmalaysia.com/

The food is not authentic, the curry is lackluster (no flavour at all), the Beef Rendang is too soft (some might like that), and lacks in flavour.

The rice is too mushy (they overcooked it and added too much water), and this is just not what I consider to be good Malaysian food.

The only good thing on the menu was the satay, but even that, I was not sold.

The desserts were okay though. Sago Sago and the Pandan Crepe was all right, but not for $8 each. I'd say $5 each considering that it isn't THAT amazing.

I also find the restaurant too dark (so sue me, I don't like to strain my eyes) and the service was slow and awful.

The head manager (Indian I think he said he was), was on his cellphone the entire time, ignored us, didn't fill our water glasses in a timely manner, and the food just took too darn long.

I don't think they prepared a proper mise en place to be ready to serve the food fast, and there wasn't Roti Canai or any other delicious meals I'm used to having in Toronto.

For $90 for 2, we didn't feel happy or full, and I wish I had just eaten some cheap pho instead of wasting money on that meal.

I'm so disappointed, I will never go back there again."}
{"text":"This place is a bomb. It was a $20 worth meal but cost you $60. The char kueh teow is ok but nothing special and the beef rendang was not good as well."}
{"text":"By far the worst south East Asian food in all the cities I've ever visited.  Even London's Malaysian dishes are miles ahead.  I'd give it negative stars if I could.

The satay beef was too salty, the chicken satay we rubbery and tasteless and the dip was basically peanut butter spoon hand stirred with lukewarm water.

Laksa sauce looked authentic, but tastes like it came from an expired sauce packet with a hint of ethylene glycol and embalming fluid.  The nyonya lamb was llamb cubes microwaved in a pool of well preserved spent motor oil with tons of soya sauce.

I can't understand why this restaurant is open, but after looking at the bill, I imagine they probably soak the few unsuspecting souls looking for Malaysian food in Toronto unlucky enough to sit down and ordering from the menu and hoping to get food.

Stay away,"}
{"text":"2nd visit after ages for lunch. Value proposition (Price, Quality/Taste, Quantity) is good. Is this the best Malaysian or South East Asian food joint in TO? No. But it is yummy. Is this a date spot? Can be.  

Service was helpful and the ambiance is fine. 

Repeat: Yes"}
{"text":"Just came from there. Had the Keropok appetizer and the Mango Chicken. The appetizer came with very little sauce (the peanut sauce is really tasty, by the way), and the main dish tasted only okay, like any other mid tier asian restaurant. It is not bad, but for such regular food it is definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"Poor quality food, cook does not seem to care what they made, and bad service. I went there twice, the first time I ordered non spicy version of tilapia and the waiter acknowledged my request for NON SPICY, but in the end they still bring a spicy dish. When I asked, they said they did not have non spicy version. Then why they did not mention it when I order? Second time I went there, they served cashew chicken with one big piece of chicken that is still raw and cold. It seems that the cook just did not even look at when he is cooking. And the waiter is very rude and just say it is very normal to have such things. I never eat there again."}
{"text":"Matahari is our go to place for Malaysian food in Toronto.  Most times we visit the city we ensure that we have dinner at Matahari.  

Favourite dishes are the mango chicken, rang dang beef, and the beef satay with peanut sauce.

Downsides are that the menu is a little pricey, but it pays off in quality.  As well, it's hard to count on them for delivery.  More nights than not, if you call for delivery, the driver hasn't shown up.  On the nights the driver does show up, the food is delicious when it is delivered.  Make sure you give yourself about an hour before you want to eat though, they're not the speediest!"}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious with my girls on a beautiful day. It was pretty empty around 6 but got busy after. We were seated on the patio. It is such a nice street full of other restaurants of different backgrounds. Lots of street parking but busy so get there early. Our server was really nice and made great recommendations. I started with the satay and it was so flavorful. The peanut sauce complimented it so well. I wish I had it right now. For my main i had the popular rendang beef that came with white rice. This was a huge portion for their 25 prix fixed menu. It was very yummy but a bit of an overload on beef. Some pieces were more soft than others. I thought it would be more saucy but the marinade is more thick. Regardless i would still recommend. My friend got a noodle dish and that was even better than mine. For dessert the server insisted we get the pandan crepe. It was crazy good. It was warm and simple. The sugar went so well with it and it was perfect. Don't let the images fool you. Way better than it looks. Ordered prosecco for my drink and it came in a cute champagne bottle. Great service great food great company."}
{"text":"I find it hard to believe that for such a multicultural city, this is the only Malaysian restaurant downtown. Whilst it's not entirely authentic, the food here is really great. I came here with a friend for Winterlicious on Saturday evening. The restaurant itself has a nice ambiance, and the service was fast, friendly and unobtrusive. The kitchen was a bit slow, but we weren't in a rush and it was no biggie. With a glass of wine in front of us, we barely even noticed.

The real reason I wanted to come here is because I absolutely looooove Malaysian roti, but sadly the one they serve here is flatter and a lot more buttery than a traditional roti. I'm also a bit disappointed they don't have any actual roti dishes on the menu, like a murtabak or roti canai.

I had the chicken satay skewers for starters which I really liked (but how can you go wrong with satay?). For main I had the beef rendang which was tender and flavourful. My friend also really liked her sambal chicken and pandan crepes. For 3 courses and 2 glasses of wine each, the bill totalled $50 each which I thought was pretty good value!"}
{"text":"We went there for winterlicious last week. I liked the place. The service was gast and efficient. The food was good. I had spring rolls, veggie curry and crepes. My only complaint about the food - really not spicy enough. I did not feel the kick at all. I guess next time I go I will ask for more heat in my food. :)"}
{"text":"The food is good, not great.  We'd been here before and decided to try it again.  It was good food.  Some of it is authentic, some is more fusiony new.  I just wanted some blow your mind awesome food, and it isn't that.  Just try it and let me know what you think."}
{"text":"After two occasions dining here for lunch, i think I've fairly made up my mind that there really isn't anything worth returning for.  Lunch took almost 2 hrs. again, not ideal if you have a busy schedule with meetings lined up.  I actually learnt my lesson this time and had no meetings booked after lunch!  Don't get me wrong, the food was delicious as usual, no complaints there.  Just this time, our table had an unwelcomed cockroach running around our table!  One of us actually lost her appetite and had to leave.  \"Came from the outside!\" the host/presumed manager/owner told us...yes, and your job is to keep it out!  Too many negatives to make this eatery worth another visit...too bad..."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday for lunch with a few coworkers after making reservations on the phone answering machine.  Their website has incorrect hours posted.  I was worried the restaurant would be closed, since their website says it's closed Monday and Tuesday.   Our group ended up walking there anyways because of the close proximity.  
Matahari was empty when we arrived at noon, we were quickly served by the lone server who's upbeat attitude lightened the uncertainty we had.  We asked for the prix-fix menu which is offered only Monday to Friday. It includes a three course meal for $18. 
The majority of my group really wanted the tilapia, but to our surprise, they only had enough to make one dish, so the rest of us had to made the hard choice of picking something else while watching only one person from the group getting the tilapia. 
When the first course arrived, I got the mango salad which was a blend of green mangoes and lettuce and my coworkers got the spring rolls (you can't mess up fried food).  The main dish arrived shortly and I ordered the curry chicken and so did the rest of my group.  It consisted of only cubed chicken breast and potatoes in a luke warm curry sauce served with a small plate of jasmine rice.  The one person from our group who got the tilapia was also disappointing as well, the filet was only a half portion, it must have been whatever that was left over from the previous day.   Another person from my group selected the cashew chicken, which appeared to be the only appetizing meal.  I could see the look of disappointment in our group.  For desserts, we all selected the pandan crepe and was told, they had no vanilla ice cream and only chocolate. Matahari, if you plan on opening your doors for business, please make sure you have the ingredients available to cook what you offer in your  menu to avoid disappointing your restaurant patrons."}
{"text":"One of the GTA's few Malaysian restaurants and definitely worth checking out. Ordered four dishes to split with friends and everyone agreed that each was just as delicious. Some of the highlights were plump grilled prawns and stretchy thin rotis perfect for scooping the last bit of curry sauce off the plate. The laksa is also exceptional here compared to other Malaysian restaurants I've been too. It's more coconut curry based rather than tomotaey. 
   The decor is similar to many mid-priced Asian restaurants; a little modern and quite clean.
   The food was a little slow to come out as someone mentioned, but the service was at least attentive. Check it out instead of Thai one night."}
{"text":"Our appetizers arrived quickly after we had placed our orders.  The Chicken Satay was grilled, served with Matahari's own peanut sauce, and marinated with their secret mix of spices and herbs. There were two pieces of chicken satay on the two skewers with the peanut sauce on the side.  I thought that the chicken meat was not tender enough and quite hard to chew through.  The peanut sauce was devoid of much peanuts.

For the main, I ordered the Mee Goreng which was a plate of \"egg noodles stir fried with a blend of spices, and had chicken, tofu, potato, bean sprouts, and egg\".  It was \"topped with crushed peanuts\".  I was actually really excited to try this Malaysian/Singaporean dish but I was a little disappointed.  The flavour and taste were quite good but I found the egg noodles to be quite chewy.  I thought that the chicken was also too hard and could have been more tender.  I didn't see many crushed peanuts on top of the dish.

For dessert, we both ordered the Pandan Crepe which was a fresh screwpine leaf crepe filled with freshly grated coconut palm sugar.  I had never tried this dessert before and it was really unique!  The fresh screwpine leaf crepe was green in colour and so soft (but didn't really taste of anything in significance).  The freshly grated coconut palm sugar was nestled inside the crepe.  I'm not a huge fan of coconut flakes or chunks which was what the texture of the palm sugar tasted like.  I enjoyed the ice cream that was included with this dish though."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for me! 
Another Baldwin Village favourite of mine! The reason it's missing out on 4 stars is that it's slightly more pricey than I think it should be (it's still not expensive though) and while the food quality here is good, compared to authentic Malaysian food Matahari does not come real close (but you could say that to almost every type of cuisine out there?), so if you are from that region of the world don't have very high expectations, but if it's your first go at Malaysian (or \"Chinese, Peranakan (Nyonya), Indian, and Eurasian.\" to quote their site) it is definitely worth a visit. 

The Mee/Nasi Goreng have always been favourites of mine, and for me personally, they are what I consider classic Malaysian food. For a very unique dessert experience, go for the Ais Kacahng (Summer only) I love it, but it is a very random dish which some might not be a fan of. Matahari does do a good job with these and more dishes, but on my first visit the portion sizes were a tad bit disappointing, but since I ordered appetizers and dessert it didn't really matter. 

The staff are pretty friendly (have not experienced them go the extra mile yet), the design of the restaurant is very nice and gives off a classy feel (more classy than most other Balwin establishments save Bocca and Bodega).  Not a huge fan of the lettering on one side of the wall.

It is a nice date spot like someone else mentioned, I would highly recommend it if you're looking for a different sort of dinner outing!"}
{"text":"Nothing overly specular, food was average in taste and quality but over priced for sure. Strangely, most of the dishes sported a bitter aftertaste that's hard to describe. Tried it on a whim, but 4 dishes split between four people and still leaving the restaurant with a $25 bill before tip make my question my life choices... Worth a try once of you've got the money to blow, ehh"}
{"text":"Chicken kapitan was wonderful. Rendang beef was amazing. Roti was unique and the coconut rice is a must. It was my birthday and our waiter brought me a complimentary mango sorbet with chocolate ice cream. A wonderful birthday meal highly recommended."}
{"text":"The Matahari is a good date spot - dark, cozy, quiet, trendy....and not too expensive, so you can pick up the full bill and not regret it the next day. 

I recommend ordering a serving of rice/coconut rice for each person, then choosing a few items to share (much the way we eat Chinese food). The plates are so flavorful, and the curry's so saucy that one dish- although delicious- is a bit of an overload for one person. 

The coconut rice is perfection - it is not sweetened so it is more mild than the Thai style and easier to eat with your entree without feeling like you're dipping into dessert early. 

I tried the mango and chicken stir-fry. Had it not been snowing that night, I'm certain the mango-chicken combination could have transported me to a white sand beach kilometers away!

If we crave Malaysian food again, this will likely be our choice, however it was not so phenomenal that I will make it a weekly or even monthly stop."}
{"text":"Matahari Grill is pricy, but its one of the few Malaysian restaurants in the city (as far as I know - if I'm wrong, please correct me lmao), so I'll let the price tag slide for now.

We came here for Winterlicious (still can't get over how cringe the name of the event sounds hahhaha) and we got the following: peanut butter chicken satay, char kway teow, beef rendang, Lindt ice cream (funnily enough, it was spelt LINT ice cream on the menu hahahahahahaha), and fried banana desert.

The food and service were great. I read a few reviews that complained about the time it took to receive the food. Maybe we just happened to pick a good day, or maybe I've just got terrible time orientation (would not be surprised TBH), but I felt like the wait was reasonable!

Anyway, let's spend some time talking about the food, because it was great. And it's been more than a week since I've eaten there, so the fact that my forgetful brain still remembers the food is a good sign.

The chicken satay was great. Perfectly seasoned. I have to say that the peanut butter sauce was not as peanut butter-y as I would have liked, but the chicken was so nicely seasoned that the lack of peanut in the peanut butter sauce (sounds silly to say) was not an issue.

Okay, now for the main course(s). The beef rendang was great... for the first few bites. I don't know how to explain, but it's one of those dishes that you immediately fall in love with and also very quickly fall out of love. It was very filling, and surprisingly (disappointingly?) not at all spicy. I guess if spicy food isn't your thing, then this would be a safe bet for you. For me, the real star was the char kway teow. Spicy, flavorful, excellent. The only bad thing was that it was finite, and before I knew it, the plate was empty.

As for the dessert, it was not at all memorable. I'm trying to think of the tastes and nothing comes to mind. Honestly, the most memorable thing about the dessert was that Lindt was misspelled as \"Lint\" on the menu.

tl;dr: Order the char kway teow."}
{"text":"Went today for an early dinner with some colleagues..a little too early, as we were there by ourselves for quite some time before anyone else showed up. 
Service as such was very good and food was fresh. 
I ordered the matahari curry chicken, which is one of their signature dishes. Very tasty, full of spice: similar to butter chicken. Dish was large (a lot of chicken), but I feel that for the price ($15), they could have given less chicken and attached a small serving of rice along with it. 
Had to get rice on the side.
Comfy, quiet, place. Great for groups. Fountain going on one of the walls."}

Since there are a lot of Malaysian dishes that cross over, it provides enough of a similarity that I'll turn to Malay cuisine to get my comfort food fix. Unfortunately, the food at Matahari Grill is just a'ight -- the food, though fairly authentic, just doesn't deliver the punch of good Malaysian cooking. 

First, the service is quite slow, and the servers tend not to come by of their own accord -- you've got to flag them down for stuff like water, drink orders, and entree orders. You know, all the usual stuff that servers do. :/

Also, the proper answer to the question, \"what wines are blended in this wine you're offering called 'The Procrastinator'?\" is NOT \"pinot noir and a couple of other things, I'm no sure.\" -- and then giving me a blank face, andthen  not offering to find out what the answer to the question is. Just saying.

Anyway. My 6 dining companions and I split a couple of Sate Ayam (chicken skewers) appetizers, which was pretty good, but skimpy on the peanut sauce. I also had the Soto Ayam (chicken soup) to start, which should have been more accurately called Chicken Tom Yum, because that's what the broth tasted like. The soup had a hot and sour flavor, and none of the turmeric color or taste that makes Soto Ayam its own distinct dish. Huge fail. 

My Mee Goreng (fried noodles with shrimp, vegetables and tofu) entree was a little bit better. It was spicy and flavorful, but the noodles were thicker than what's typically used, and on the mushy side. Meh.

For dessert, my companions and I split the Bananas Matahari (essentially fried bananas with caramel sauce and whipped cream), and the Sago-Sago (tapioca pearls with palm sugar and coconut cream), both of which were quite good. The Sago-Sago has a different kind of sweetness, not sugary but more earthy sweet... and who doesn't love tapioca balls? :) 

The decor is a little bizarre. I don't care for the giant platitudes on the walls, but... whatever. 

In sum, Matahari Grill is a fair introduction to Malaysian/Indonesian cuisine for the uninitiated, but for those familiar with the dishes and tastes, it'll end up being a disappointment. Compounded with the underperforming service, it'll probably be awhile 'till I make my way back to Matahari."}
{"text":"This would be the restaurant to go if you crave Malaysian or South East Asian food. 

I went there last Friday for their Winterlicious dinner. It is truly a hidden gem. If you just walked pass this restaurant at night, you wouldn't even notice it since it was very quite from outside. But when you opened their sliding door, you will see a totally different picture: a warm and cozy restaurant packed with dinners that all look very relaxed and happy. This is a great place to celebrate the end of one busy week on Friday night. 

I had their winterlicious menu: Chicken Satay for appetizer, Rendang Beef for entree, and Pandan Crêpe for desert. My friend ordered from their regular menu: spring rolls for appetizer, Matahari Seafood Curry Grill for entree, and Sago-Sago for desert. My favorite three are deep-fried spring roll, Matahari Seafood Curry Grill and Pandan Crepe. It has been three days but I still remeber the tastes of their food."}
{"text":"I was looking for an Indonesian restaurant in Toronto but I could not find any. Matahari Grill was the closest Malaysian restaurant to where I stayed. We decided to give this place a try for dinner.

The restaurant was small, probably about 20 tables or so. It had a patio seating area with tables and umbrellas. Had it not been drizzling, it would've been nice to sit outside and relax. We decided to take the inside table nearest to the window to outside. The ambiance inside was upscale, with low lighting and white tablecloth, meant to be for a romantic and intimate outing. 

The service was a bit slow. As far as I could tell, there was only one waiter, who that day had a big red sauce stain on his white shirt, and a lady who occasionally filled up our water glasses. 

We ordered some keropok, which we devoured in no time. The dipping sauce for the keropok was kind of different. The menu said it was peanut sauce but it was yellowish of turmeric and tasted really good. 

For the kids, I ordered some chicken satay with steamed rice. We ordered the Asam Matahari and the stir fried green beans with belacan. The green beans were good. But the Asam Matahari was just ok. I would probably put a little more tamarind and less sugar in the sauce. 

Maybe it just happened to be what we ordered. Although nothing on our table was bad, none of the dishes we ordered was a wow."}
{"text":"fantastic food that's hard to find elsewhere in toronto. service is friendly and fast. slogans on wall are cheesy."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I agreed to give it a 3. 

Why?

He ordered char kuey teow ($13) and his review:
Good amount of spice, shrimp was cooked well but there was no punch. It wasn't very favourable. I tried it and it was bland, not as charcoal-ish as I expected. 

I ordered nasi lemak ($13). It's supposed to be a simple dish yet it's flavour speaks for itself. However the one I got was far from my expectation. Where's the sambal? It was replaced with caramalized onions with anchovies. I could barely taste coconut in my coconut rice, another disappointment. The shrimp however was good, it has some rendang taste to it. Also, since when nasi lemak has mango salad? Never! It should be peanuts. Sigh."}
{"text":"So my friend and I were walking around Baldwin Village - and you know when you get to the point where it's like \"Man, I've been to every single restaurant here... okay, time to re-try something?\"  Yeah - so that was me yesterday.

Last time I went to Matahari Grill was literally three years ago.  The first time I went, it really detered me due to the service.  So I decided to give it one more try just to see how it goes.

The ambiance in this place is nice.  Small and chic.  Giant writing with a quote that makes me smile.  My friend ordered the Mee Goreng, and I had the Nasi Lemak.  My friend couldn't finish her Mee Goreng (but then again, she's a tiny little Asian girl, so I wasn't surprised).  The Nasi Lemak was great considering that it was coconut rice, with shrimp, dried anchovies, achar-char and egg (a little bti of everything).  It wasn't too spicy, and I was able to finish a great portion of the dish.

The service though was questionable.  I know I can't say that they have poor service due tot their accents; however, I was not impressed by their quick service here and there.  While my friend was trying to decide between two items (for less than a minute), the waiter walked away. Not only this, when we were paying, we wanted to give them a $100 bill, and he asked if we had credit cards, since they didn't have cash on hand.  I found that a little bit strange, but in the end, we pushed them to give us our change in cash.

Overall, food was really good - but service was very very poor.  If you want great Malaysian food with great service, head to Restoran Malay up north.  It's much better."}
{"text":"Rendang and satay is awesome service was quick! Must eat place while in downtown. The service was also over the top and they will try to accommodate and make you as comfortable as possible. Go try it! The ratings are a bit off and is worth it especially on my birthday."}
{"text":"This is, by far, one of the best restaurants in Toronto.

You literally need a cigarette after a good meal here, and you might walk out feeling weak in the knees.

It's owner run and operated as well, which is nice.  The decor is chic and the place is tiny.  No visit to Toronto is complete without swinging by this small but delicious restaurant.  They also have a lunch special which is much more affordable.  It is DELICIOUS - you MUST go here.  The prawns are especially good."}
{"text":"Went to Matahari for a Winterlicious lunch with my colleagues after Valens ended up full for us.

Considering the student domination along Baldwin Village due to its proximity to U of T, Matahari has the more businessy feel to the place. Matahari specializes in Southeast Asian food, so if you're looking for your standard Chinese/Japanese/East Asian flavour this isn't it.

The entrance door is a sliding door, which caught me off guard initially. It's definitely something of note when visiting here.

I ordered the Matahari vegetarian spring roll, mango chicken, and the pandan crepe. First criticism I had after ordering was that the food took a very long time to come out; our table of 8 came in at around 12pm and didn't leave until just after 2pm. Anyway, the spring roll was quite good; lightly crisped and delicious. The mango chicken was...mediocre. The mango felt like it was pineapple, though the chicken was decent. Nothing special in terms of the rice though. Finally, the pandan crepe is, in my opinion, an acquired taste. Some of my colleagues loved it, but I was never a fan of coconut too much. I'll give the benefit of the doubt for the dessert.

Again, service was too slow for lunch. I was lucky that my supervisor wasn't in the day we had lunch, so our whole department was able to stay beyond the lunch hour given.

With the options available along Baldwin, I don't think I'll return here unless requested."}
{"text":"Matahari has been around for a while and is a solid fixture of the Baldwin strip. The clear interior (with phrases on the wall in big white letters) and small patio are great for groups and the Malaysian food is well-priced and delicious. The menu is small but with a good variety of dishes, including vegetarian and vegan options. On my last visit I had the curry laksa, which was sweet and creamy with chicken, tofu, and 2 kinds of noodles (rice and egg) swimming in a spicy soup. It was yummy, although quite heavy for the summer and I couldn't finish it. For dessert, we shared a bunch including the crepes (just ok) and the \"snow mountain\" (sticky rice with syrup and milk on top, very sweet yet light). Service was okay. I was here with a big group. They were a bit slow and not everyone got their entree at the same time. I would come back if I were in the area, although there are a lot of other great places on Baldwin -- stiff competition!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place 3.5 stars. I came here a couple years ago during Winterlicious and their fixed menu was absolutely delicious. I wish I could tell you what I had, but I can't recall. 

I returned here again recently and the food was just alright. I got the Chicken Satay lunch entree and it was pretty good. I've had better chicken satay before, so it didn't blow my mind. That isn't to say that it wasn't good though - just that I expected a bit more. The side vegetables that came with the meal were kind of boring, so it just made the meal \"okay\" instead of amazing. 

I can, however, vouch for their Sago dessert. I absolutely love this desert. It is simply tiny tapioca balls covered in some sweet, dark, and runny sauce, as well as a sweet coconut cream. A definite must-try if you're looking for a light dessert.

Price is decent. I'll probably come back and try a different entree next time!"}
{"text":"I have never eaten this particular cuisine before, so I cannot give a review based on comparison. I will however state that I was exceptionally pleased by the food. I do not eat very spicy food and was very pleased that they catered to that when asked to keep it mild. We ordered a variety of items,  as we were with a group that frequented this place. I don't remember the names of all the dishes., we ate but I can say that they ALL tasted amazing. The service was great, the food came out as it was finished, and the price point was good. Would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Really delicious and different types of curry in every dish.  Must try!  I loved their home made vegetable spring rolls.  Crispy, fresh and the Matahari sauce is so nice and tasty.  

The Curry chicken dish was delicious although would have been a top notch dish with a few vegetables in there.  Its chicken and potatoes in a curry sauce and rice on the side.  The other dish was a vegetable curry which was delicious but if you added chicken to that dish it would have been perfect!!

Dessert, simple but tasty.

I highly recommend this place!

Only negative to say is the waiter we had (being the older one and indian) was a bit moody from the beginning and didn't say thank you even though we left him a 20% tip."}
{"text":"Service was okay. I ended up getting the Matahari Platter for two. Even though it says it's for two people, I got it for myself and it didn't really fill me up. The dish tasted amazing but overall portions were not enough especially since it cost $22. The place felt cozy too. I feel there are more affordable and better places serving Malaysian food though."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Matahari Grill today with 5 of my colleagues.  Everyone enjoyed their food.  We all had the prix fixe menu for $18.  

The chicken satay was very tasty but I enjoyed the green mango salad more.  It was fresh and light and the mangos were not overripe and not hard as a rock.  It's a small thing but a big deal.   

The portion sizes were very generous and the Curry Laksa (egg and rice noodle in a tantalizing coconut curry broth with chicken and tofu balls) was particularly huge.  The mango chicken was very good but tt was not spicy enough for me (although to be fair, I didn't ask for it to be made extra spicy).  The hot sauce they brought me had the right kick to it for my taste buds and no one else felt that the dish needed more heat.

The Matahari stir-fry (which I do not see on the regular menu) had a very plentiful and flavourful sauce over glass noodles and vegetables and chicken.  It was delicious.  

The dessert (fried bananas with a sweet sauce and whipped cream, was probably the weakest part of the meal but still provided a nice touch of sweetness to finish things off.  

I didn't find the food pricey like some reviewers have mentioned.  I thought that for $18, the value for the money was quite good.  The only real negative comment I have is that the food did not all come out at the same time and we often had to wait up to 5 minutes until the rest of our colleagues received their meal.  I do appreciate that this is a first world problem..."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and it is inconsistent. Sometimes good and sometimes bad. Service is generally slow. Prices are somewhat high."}
{"text":"Went here with my Indonesian spouse and we complexly enjoyed the meal.. All of the dishes were ordered were cooked to the standards we expect and were used to. We had the Chicken Satay Appetizer with Beef Rendang along with Chicken Mango which was served with a slice of orange. IF you are craving Malaysian or Indonesian food I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Matahari Grill is our 2nd stop for our Baldwin Food Crawl. 

Love the decor, chic, dark and romantic (definitely not good for photo taking!)

Though without reservations, we got seated right away at one of the tables at the back of the restaurant.

We just want a taste of the menu so ended up ordering:

Eggplant Malay ($10) - grilled eggplant appetizer

Char Kway Teow ($15) - stired fried flat rice noodle in dark soy sauce

Nasi Lemak ($15) - Malaysian Coconut Rice went really well with the savoury Anchovy

All nicely done, but just lack that wow factor. Though I requested spicy but none of the dishes were spicy enough to make my Yelp Friends sweat! 

Prices while definitely on the pricey side, though in line with the area restaurants."}
