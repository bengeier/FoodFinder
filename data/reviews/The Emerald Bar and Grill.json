{"text":"Great place for a traditional breakfast - ham/sausage/bacon, eggs, home fries & coffee, or a cheese omelette w/fries & coffee, for $5.50 including tax.  Good eating, especially the fries - huge slabs of potato lightly seasoned.  And surprisingly good coffee!"}
{"text":"I feel like this is the kind of place I'd come if I had a wife that I hated. It sounds as though half the people in here are avoiding some woman, I assume the other half are here for the company.   Domestic pints are 5.50$. The price isn't to die for but it ain't bad. Guinness pints are 7$... Same deal. Their selection is poor but the beer tastes like they have clean pipes.   The bartender seems to take a sort of clean-cut Irish pride in his work...  Which is kindve neat and unusual to see. The bar is decidedly Irish,  complete with flag and paraphernalia around bar. This is like...  A FAMILY DIVE BAR. Everyone's super friendly,  but kinda... Drunk... In aesthetic sense and probably literal sense (the kindve guys who sing loudly and terribly along to Hotel California, teetering dangerously on the line between just joking and actually thinking they sound good and possibly should've been rock stars themselves); it's messy and beaten around the edges, but it's a clean grime; and apparently-  by the look of previous reviews- they serve a CHEAP Greasy Spoon breakfast."}
{"text":"This place opened as the Emerald Grill in 1952 and operated as a diner, jukeboxes and all. It is still operated by the same family. The original location was next door, on the corner of Coxwell. They got their liquor license in the early 70's, but still serves a decent greasy spoon breakfast.   Large eggs, nice chunky home fries and decent bacon, and, according to our resident expert, perfectly toasted toast.  Breakfast is a steal at 5.95, tax in AND includes coffee. They even substituted an extra egg for me (totaling 3) instead of bacon. MANY places won't do this."}
{"text":"The worst food ever and service!!! They got me the wrong food that I had ordered and they started to argue me that i was wrong?! Very bad customer service! Never had this before. Will never come back again!   On top of it all there bathrooms look like they haven't been cleaned since they opened!"}
