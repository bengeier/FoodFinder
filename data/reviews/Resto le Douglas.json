{"text":"About 8 years ago we were in line for customs at the US/Canada border at 9 PM. Our alternator was giving out and our battery died right at the customs window!  We called AAA and the customs agent closed up his window and left us there until we were rescued. The tow truck operator asked if we wanted to be towed to Quebec or back to NY. We chose Quebec, so he recommended staying at Le Douglas which also had a restaurant. We were so enchanted by the cozy atmosphere and good hearty food (we ordered the escargot and 2 pizzas) that we now make this our regular stop after the border crossing. The breakfast is always a highlight of our trip. Fresh eggs, hearty toast, and friendly service. It's a good place to start warming up my basic French although English is spoken. We have had our share of what I call \"AAA vacations\" (because of unplanned breakdowns) and this was our favorite."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast en route to New York.  This place is a lot better than we expected.  Service was terrific.  Menu was good .  Simple diner food, well prepared.  I indulged in a croque monsieur (basically a french toast sandwich with ham and cheese) served with fruit salad and sweetened cream or maple syrup.  On the menu the Croque is called \"Le Super Sandwich.\" It was super.  So was the very pleasant older lady who served us.

Decor was nice enough - Italianish? Clean restrooms and convenient to the highway. About 10 mins to the border."}
{"text":"Je fréquente l'endroit depuis 7 ans. Il y a de tout au menu, mais je dois dire que certain plat on changer de goût au fil du temps, surement du au différent changement de chef en cuisine. Le menu est simple, rien de raffiner, du poulet, du boeuf, des pâtes, de la pizza, vous voyez le genre. Le service est rapide, mais l'endroit commence à être défriché un peu, un peu de sang neuf ferait du bien. C'est une institution là bas, le restaurant est ouvert depuis plus de 40 ans."}
