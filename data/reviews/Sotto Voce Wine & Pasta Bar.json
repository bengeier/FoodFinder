{"text":"Nothing special, over priced regular pasta, the portions are very small for no reason, the table I sat on was moving and the surface was not properly clean although I went on an empty Wednesday evening. save your money and go to another place"}
{"text":"Went here on a date with Groupon overall meal was great and service was exceptional. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We arrived in Toronto on Valentine's after a long drive and were lucky enough to find a table at Sotto Voce. The atmosphere was wonderful. Great music, good vibe and great service. The owner took care of us. We were with our 12 y.o. and made all of us feel welcome. She even went off menu and made a special dish for her. The apps were delicious. The Carciofi Fritti was a hit and the Crostini Tre Modi were delicious and portions are generous. We had 3 of the pasta dishes as well as the meatballs and all were a hit. If we were locals this would definitely be on our regular rotation."}
{"text":"I wandered over here with a date on a recent Saturday night.  The weather was incredible and I was looking for a patio in Little Italy, which as everyone knows, is difficult to find when the weather is great.  There were only two tables left outside, so we were squeezed in between two couples.  The tables were so close together that it was impossible for anyone to have private conversations.  Me being the kind of person I am, I struck up a few conversations with the women on either side of me, which made my date a much more enjoyable experience (was that a low blow?)...  The wine list is quite impressive, though I ended up sticking with a non-aIcoholic drink (very out of character for me).  I ordered the beet and goat cheese salad and Le Date had the Caesar.  I love goat cheese and beets, so I was really happy with it, but the Caesar was nothing to write home about.  It consisted of just four pieces of Romaine lettuce and a smattering of dressing.    For the meal, Le Date had a sandwich (the only one on the menu and what it is escapes me) and he said it was very bland.  I had the roasted garlic and chili pasta with olive oil.  It was pretty good.  I would normally have dessert (the options looked yummy) and coffee but wanted to split, so I will have to go back with different company."}
{"text":"Didn't bring bread or butter.  Had to ask.  Mussels were over cooked and tasted like rubber.  The pasta was just ok for the price. Nice ambience but the food and sevice were mediocre."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for a dinner that I purchased with a groupon. My only complaint was that she immediately (before we even had water) explained, in detail, the parameters of the groupon. Which detracted from the considerable ambiance. Perhaps, this particular server had had poor experiences with groupon customers in the past.  Other than that I had an excellent time and a wonderful dinner. We had the goat cheese and pear crustini, the beet salad, the meatball antipasti, the seared tuna entree and the tiramisu. I haven't a single complaint about any of them. In fact, I'd order them all again."}
{"text":"Fabulous atmosphere, outstanding food and friendly staff!  We could not have asked for a better experience!  We can't wait to go back!  Order the meatballs to taste authentic Italian taste."}
{"text":"This place was actually not to bad. The front entrance needs to be more clearly marked. Overall the atmosphere was excellent. I took a date their and it was very romantic. The prices are typical of the neighborhood but the food left something to be desired. Now I should mention that I do consider myself to be somewhat of a foody. The antipasto was just fine, the pasta was Cooked well and the tuna seared just as you would expect. The prices are just a little too high. If your looking for some decent Italian food and it's too cold to look around then I would definetly recommend this place, otherwise try something else."}
{"text":"There weren't that many street meat choices as like other festivals I had attended, so we decided to go to Sotto Voce.  The menu was decent enough and surprisingly the wait to get a table on the patio wasn't too bad.    I understand it was busy there, but we had two different servers come to our table at multiple times.  I know I'm not in the hospitality industry to understand logistics, but maybe some owners/managers handle customer service differently.    Anyway we ordered a white wine sangria which took quite a while to get.  Compared to the red wine sangria we ordered a few weeks ago at Milagro, I don't know if it was worth the price.  Hardly any fruits and it looked like more of a fruit punch.   We ordered a slew of appies - sliders, arancini and polenta fries.  The polenta fries were probably the best part of the meals with the exception of the dipping sauce which was served  in an espresso cup.  The arancini and the sliders lacked flavour.  I don't know if I really felt that pine nuts were needed in the sliders.    At the end, the manager (I assume) was apologetic for the food and service.  She mentioned to us that it's \"an experience\" and hopes we come back to visit.  Maybe she could tell we were disappointed.  Who knows?  This is why I jumped the rating from 2 to a 3."}
{"text":"We started here for our great night and food crawl.  We were welcomed with the Crostini Tre Modi (prosciutto with fig and goat cheese on bread, roasted peppers with parmesan on bread, and sauteed rapini with ricotta on bread). I had the rapini and the taste was very subtle - not overpowering by any means. The Sicilian meatballs came afterwards - Oh my God, these little balls were packed with flavour. I loved the pine nut crunch inside its texture, and the tomato sauce was amazing. We then moved onto the pasta, where we had the Campagne (potato gnocchi with swiss chard, cherry tomatoes, boar sausages, and lemon, garlic and olive oil) and some Linguine with a rose sauce and sundried tomatoes. I absolutely loved the gnocchi - the sauce was somewhat tangy and the gnocchi tasted very pillowy. The two Italians beside me was also blown away by the gnocchi (as was everyone else at the table!). I would definitely return, even if just for the gnocchi."}
{"text":"One of our favourite restaurants in Toronto.  It's a gem.  Intimate, incredible food, run by Anita an impresario with personality, flair, and style.   Great and reasonably priced wine, and go with the special, authentic, delicious and Italian.  Highly recommend - date night or with friends."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday on Friday with six friends, and we had an amazing time! The food was incredible, I loved every bite of the scallop linguini. My friends enjoyed the risotto and gnocchi. The staff was friendly, and the atmosphere was cozy and intimate. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The ambience here is wonderful. The wine list is exquisite. We had the Ripasso which was full and complimented the candle-lit room. Also had a slice of Dufflet's chocolate mousse cake which went well with the wine.  We got there around 8p on a Friday evening, and around 9p it got extremely busy. Be prepared to move to a smaller table if there are a larger group.  One of the nicer aspects of College & Manning."}
{"text":"Here for a company Christmas party and the staff is great! Amazing appetizer selection and such a cozy vibe."}
{"text":"I went here last night with a group of eight for a birthday dinner. They accommodated us well and Anita was so lovely! We started off with the Tre Modi with amazing flavours (definitely try this!) and the zucchini fritters with a very delicious sauce. Most of us in the group ordered the Campagne (with spicy sausage) which was a hit with everyone, although I do which they added more veggies and sausage in the dish. Will definitely be back! Thanks!"}
{"text":"I came on a Saturday night with my boyfriend We made reservations so we didn't have to wait since it was actually a pretty busy night. The weather was nice and the patio was pretty much completely full. Once we sat down, shortly after we were asked if we wanted drinks and the server was very knowledgeable and recommended something for my bf. She also let us know of the daily specials. Once we decided to order, for some odd reason, we had another server that took our order. We ordered the following items: Daily special crostini with prosciutto, fig and goat cheese Daily special- grilled calamari Grilled Rack of lamb with rapini Grilled New York strip loin  Side of their signature meatballs  I was quite disappointed with the grilled calamari as firstly I was not expecting the calamari to be sliced into small pieces; plus it was literally soaked in the tomato sauce. It was served in a bowl so it suppose to be a saucy dish- I have definitely had better grilled calamari at other Italian establishments. I did not like the crostini combination as I guess I am not a fig-liker- I didn't think the flavours went well together and basically just took out the fig. The one part of the meal where I thought would be great was the meatballs, but they were dry and the mozzarella inside was not thoroughly melted and was chunky. My lamb entree was okay but I though lamb was a bit small in comparison to my bf's steak. The rapini was also a little burnt so it wasn't the greatest dish.  At the end, when we wanted to pay, it took quite a long time for someone to come over as I guess it got super busy and they were all trying to bring the food out. Service at the beginning was great, but at the end, it wasn't so great.  I like Little Italy, so I will be trying a different restaurant next time."}
{"text":"A wonderful quaint spot to enjoy some authentic Italian cuisine! Our hostess/owner/server Anita made us feel like we were dining in her home. Food was exceptional but the staff and ambiance made us feel relaxed and at ease. Our special requests were honored and taken in stride. I can't recommend this special restaurant enough!"}
{"text":"Service is great in the beginning when we just got sat at 6:30pm. Appetizers were okay; ordered a crostini with goat cheese, fig & prosciutto, meatball sliders and beef carpaccio. Not much flavor in the carpaccio, for the crostini, it was toasted with goat cheese melted nicely but the prosciutto was cut way too thick. Should have been at least half or more thinner because it was just hard to chew off and was tough. The meatball sliders were nothing special, just meatballs in tomato sauce with arugula on a slider bun, but wasn't toasted or anything, room temperature.  For mains I got a lamb rack, seasoning is okay, could of used a little more salt, other than that there was no other herbs seasoned on nor marinated. Feels like I can buy it in a supermarket and cook myself at home. Came with sauté rapini, wasn't cooked through enough, still raw in the middle and still crunchy.   Also ordered a sirloin with frites. Sirloin was cooked to our request but as we ate the frites, we found a piece of hair in it, very disgusting. We told the server and she just threw out the plate and ask if there was something else we want. She wasn't sorry for what happened, didn't even feel bad.   Then we got seared tuna with mixed greens. Tuna was not seared on a hot enough surface, more meat was cooked then needed, it lacked seasoning and the mixed greens were tasteless. No seasoning in the salad and dressing was basically none but vinegar, that wasn't what it stated on the menu.  There was only 3 kinds of desserts they offered. Got the vanilla ice cream with espresso and lemon meringue cake. They poured the espresso over ice cream melting it making it taste like cold espresso, nothing special. The cake was huge and overly sweet, none of the tables around could finish it and wasn't anything spectacular.  I was disappointed and would not come back or recommend any of my friends."}
{"text":"Fridayevening was empty and we got a good table without reservation. friendly welcoming staff.  Zucchini Fritters that was v. good. Sicilian Meatballs was really good. Rustica Salad was really good. good size portion as main dish, or for share. Pasta Dal Mare, did not really meat my expectaion.  Street Parking is really challenging.  in general I find it overpriced for the service and food."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband right before going to a concert. My husband ordered a drink, we shared an appetizer (fried zucchini flowers) and both ordered different pasta as an entrées. The pasta was definitely not made fresh and they were overcooked. The service wasn't the greatest neither. The waitress seems to try to hard to look cool and hip that she lacked some simple service formalities. She never came back to ask how our dishes were. And at the very end, when we asked for the bill, she than asked how was the food. I told her it wasn't really good. She quickly wipe that smile off her face and change attitude right away. Didn't even bother asking what was wrong with the dishes. She just gave us the bill and left looking annoyed. Did I also mention that the ventilation is terrible here? We left there smelling like burnt food and was so embarrassed walking into the concert like that. This place is an insult to Italian cuisine. Will never come back."}
{"text":"We had a fish and seafood dinner, everything was great. They were very attentive to our needs.  Service was fast, we were early so I'm not sure if it gets busy later in the evening. Pasta plates are generous."}
{"text":"Great food,great atmosphere! I had the lamb chops with a side of Brussel sprouts with chorizo and raisins, I'm not a big fan of Brussel spouts but they were so amazing ! The Lamb chops were amazing !!"}
{"text":"(closer to 3.5 stars)  PROS + Customizable pasta dishes + Patio seating available  + Servers seem to be knowledgeable about the wine list + Takes credit cards  CONS - Patio tables are spaced too closely together - Slooowwww service (understaffed) - Antipasti plate was just okay  Came around 7pm as a group of 3. Initially we wanted to sit outside at the patio but we couldn't find space to accommodate the 3 of us (only 2-tops were available). We ended up sitting outside. With the wide-open doors and windows we were still able to catch the warmth and summer breeze from outside.  We shared a bottle of the ALBARINO. As a chilled white it was plenty refreshing enough for a hot June evening but I found it to be a bit uninteresting and too light in taste to be memorable. It was said to be similar to the pinot grigio, which they had run out of. Our waitress seemed to be fairly knowledgeable about the wine list, which I appreciate.  We also shared the ANTIPASTI plate. Came with 2 kinds of charcuterie, sliced fresh mozzarella, 1 piece each of grilled eggplant & grilled zucchini, slices of provolone-like cheese, and wedges of sundried tomato. Everything was in portions of 4 except for the grilled veggies. I guess the plate was meant to be shared between 4 people. It was strange to have to cut up the veggies to divvy up. The meats were good, the mozz was good, and the star of the plate was the sundried tomatoes. The provolone-like cheese was unmemorable.   I had the DAILY PASTA #2, which on that day was penne rigate w/ hot italian sausage, sweet onions, & peas in a Parmesan cream sauce. I switched out the penne for spaghettini. I appreciated that the chef was able to accommodate my pasta request. The sausage was delicious - had a nice spicy kick and well-flavored with fennel. Al dente pasta, just the way it should be. A solid pasta dish here.  My friends had the other daily pasta, an olive-oil based spaghettini with various vegetables and shrimp; and the risotto with chicken and mushrooms. I found the pasta dish to be a bit dry. The risotto had a nice rich broth.   Service was extremely slow due to being understaffed. It took a long time to flag down our server each time, but she was pleasant and took good care of us in between running around."}
{"text":"Nice place to go for patio lunch or drinks.   Bruschetta was delicious. The olive oil was quite good that I asked what the brand was.   They have those San Pellegrino sodas (aranciata).   Service is friendly. If I'm ever in the area again during patio season I can see myself coming here again for sure."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and the risotto is delicious. The last time I went, it was a little dry so perhaps there was a different chef that night. However, I think I added too much cheese to the dish as the server was very accomodating.  The best item that I just love is the fig appetizer. Who knew how delicious they could be? That is consistently wonderful. Great place for a date night!"}
