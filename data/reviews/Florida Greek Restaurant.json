{"text":"FLORIDA has the absolute GREATEST, most authentic, Greek food that I have ever had in my life!!!  The potatoes, the lamb, the souvlaki, the broccoli, the salad, the rice, the bread, and ESPECIALLY THE TZATZIKI!!!!! There is no substitute.  It's like BBQ sauce...not to be taken lightly...this tzatziki is always homemade by the owner, Helen, herself!!! 

They are also the only Greek restaurant in Toronto (or anywhere else I've ever seen) that has an authentic rotisserie grill room (where they cook the lamb!!!) on the beautiful outdoor dining patio. 

The waitresses are wonderful and considerate, and every time I eat here, there is always friendly conversation with the bartender and patrons. (And between us, I have seen local and international celebrities in there more than once!!) ;-)

Plus they pour whiskey the \"American way!\" :)"}
{"text":"I came here due to a suggestion from someone who loves Greek food. First thing I notice is how small the place is. It's hard to even walk past the take out counter as there were people ordering take out at 6:30 pm. I thought it might be good considering the line up. However, once I entered the hole in the wall mom and pop shop, I realized it's not somewhere to really chill out lounge in but rather grab a quick bite. There were lots of construction Europeans drinking and making noise. When the food finally came after above average wait, I was underwhelmed. There was too much tomatoes in the salad so we had to ask for more cucumbers and feta. The whole salad was very chunky and not cut up. It wasn't anything special and just tasted like putting a bunch of vegs and feta together. Then I tried the chicken skewer. It was a bit dry and bland. I love meat. But I only ended up eating one instead of two skewers. I then tried the rice and it lacked flavor and lemon. Everything needed more seasoning except the pita lol. Needless to say, I've had much better and would pay more for a better experience. This place is around a 2.25."}
{"text":"You know this place is going to be good when you walk in and everyone there is Greek. It feels so warm and friendly as the staff there is super attentive and it almost feels like you're in Greece (or what I imagine Greece would be like). The food here is absolutely delicious. I got the special which was fish. It was a bit on the pricier side ($20 for salad, fish and fries) but SO worth it. The fish was nice and crispy however it was literally as though they took the fish without cleaning it and just fried it. There were so many bones that is was a bit painful to eat. The fries were perfectly crispy. My friends got the pork souvlaki  and the ground beef dish which they all really enjoyed. The meals are big and I would say they're large enough to feed two people at a satisfied state (provided they're not heavy eaters). Will definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"This is the place in greektown where yo go when you want authentic Greek village food.  The ambience is basic but you don't come here for the ambience. There's a nice patio open through the summer.  The service is friendly and unassuming, just like in Greece.  If you want to feel superior to the servers you should try some other place.  I see a one star review accusing the staff of racism, but looking further into that review it seems that the reviewer herself has a race issue and a complex.  I've brought people of many different races here and everyone has always been super friendly.  

On to the food.  They have daily Greek small dishes (Mezes) which you should try, different every day and fresh.  Their souvlaki is made from top notch meat and grilled to perfection. Pork is amazing (pork is main meat back in Greece ) but other meats are great as well. Th bifteki is juicy and well spiced - good chuck used.  The fries with feta are what Greeks eat with beer and so should you. The prices are amazing.  Pork souvlaki stick with garlic bread is $2.50!  The garnish for the main dishes is a full fledged dish in itself.  A gem!"}
{"text":"Great food at cheap prices.

Pita (pork $4.50, chicken $5.00) came stuffed, more than enough to feed you if you're hungry and the souvlaki was juicy and tender. No overcooked burnt bits here! The greek salad was good, the lettuce was fresh and there was plenty in a large size for 2 to share.

Oh, and there's even complimentary bread and service that will ensure you're never thirsty on a hot summer's day. Bored of your dinner companion? The outdoor patio seating is equipped with a TV.

{"text":"This review is long overdue.  Didnt have a yelp account back then.  If you are of a white background, your food will be good.  If you are of another ethnicity, there is a very goof chance youll get cut-eye from both customers and staff.    My husband(white) and i(asian) went to this restuarant because the place we orginially wanted to go to wad closed.  We decided to eat on the patio.  And all we got was dirty looks from customers and attitude from our waitress.  She took a very long time to bring us our drinks and take our order.

We ordered the exact same thing.  Calamari, except mine was the dinner and his was the appetizer.  His food came first, and we didnt thing much of it at the moment, so he held off eating his food till mine came.  While waiting he wanted to order another drink, but our waitress avoided our table like the plegue.  So he got up and got his deink himself at the bar.  15min later, my food still hasnt come, so my husband and i started to share his food, thinking we would just split mine when it came.  It was delicious.  Cook on the calamari was perfect.  Gabe us something to look forward to.  Then another 10min went by.  We finally got the waitress' attenetion and asked why my food hasnt come out yet. She said she'd check on it.  Comes out with my plate in about 5 min. 

The food was so bad it deserves its own paragraph.  Texture of the calamari was like it was ready and had been sitting under a heat lamp.  Everything single thing on the plate was salty.  Excessively salty.  The salad, the rice, the potatoes.  It was like salt was sprinkled all over the whole dish just before serving it to me.  

We decided to just pay and leave.  And even that, when i put the money down on the tray, the waitress wished us a good day out of obligation, and my husbanf had to tell her i wanted change back.  And the waitress genuinely asked why?  We expressed our disappointment in the food, and before we could complain about the service, she cut me off to say the foods taste isnt her fault.  Then walked away.  She dropped the change off and left.

It was a really disgusting experience."}
