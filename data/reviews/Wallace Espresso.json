{"text":"Cute shop, delicious coffee! I was offered a free cup to replace the one I was holding - they were that convinced that their coffee was better & I have to say, they were right. I will definitely be back then next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Like, really, delicious stuff. Everything's a double without the extra charge. But, you can ask for a single or half decaf if your tummy is a wuss, like mine apparently is.

Good selection of baked goods, including gluten-free and vegan stuffs.

Friendly service and crowd - willing conversationalists that clientele. 

Not really a place to hang out though - just a bench and two bar stools. So if you want to chill with a bud, perhaps not the best place for you."}
{"text":"Cute!  Cute! Cute!  I had an amazing cappuccino and chocolate croissant.  I'll be back for sure.  The girl behind the counter was very nice."}
{"text":"Best latte I've had in the city. Espresso doesn't taste burnt or bitter. They don't charge extra for soy. Great customer service. Can't beat the prices. $3.50 for a medium, $4 for a large. 

Bonus: They sell the most delicious quinoa cookies from Defloured."}
{"text":"Wallace Espresso is a fantastic little local coffee spot. I've lived near the shop since it first opened, but have never visited until this summer - but I'm very glad that I finally went. The staff is great and everyone is super nice. I have yet to try everything, but their lattes are absolutely fantastic! If you're in the neighbourhood, I'd definitely recommend dropping by. 

Great people, great vibe, great coffee."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! I live by Dufferin Stn but almost always walk down Wallace Ave to Lansdowne Stn just so I can pop in here before work!

The staff are great! Always friendly and chatty and make an amazing flat white! As I always stop in on my way to work the lack of seating isn't an issue for me, but if you're looking to sit for a while this wouldn't be the place! My only negative comment is I'm not wild about the brown sugar at the condiment stand. Would be nice to have raw or even white sugar! Still 5 stars regardless!!"}
{"text":"$2 any size for drip coffee - how can you beat that? The staff are friendly and even the regulars that go there are as well. I haven't had any lattes, but I plan to the next time. 

It's a great cafe as a stopover for a quick pick-me-up or to catch up with an old friend with quite a few seating options inside and out. 

Overall: Very affordable for delicious roasts. Will come back and totally recommend for anyone in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee, great service.  Awesome addition to the neighbourhood, people who care about the product they serve and the people they service!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I hesitate to give this place 5 stars is so it stays relatively unknown.. Definitely one of the best espresso joints in town.  The coffee is cheap and good, the service is fast and friendly, and they offer a wide variety of delicious and locally made food items.  They also promote local artists in the Wallace-Emerson area.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Delicious coffee and pastries, at a reasonable price. I was pleased to find this place, considering how few good caf√©s there are in the area."}
{"text":"New location of the fantastic and always crowded Wallace Espresso. Great coffee and friendly service. Good place to meet neighbours & have casual chats."}
{"text":"I live around the corner and pop in often.  Great, quality coffee brewed right.  Simple space (more of a take out/away than a sit down cafe due to size) and very friendly service.  Attractive pricing too!  A great addition to our neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Super vibe-y at the original Wallace street location - I travel out of my way to go there. Love the dark roast espresso for my cortado. Yum. Also, well priced."}
{"text":"Best espresso and macchiato I have found in this city and many others. Highly recommended. Well worth a stop."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. The owner is insanely polite and courteous, as well as the people who work the bar. Good vibes, great coffee, very affordable. 

Anyone who lives in the neighborhood here knows this is the place to go to. 

Try the scones! Delicious to go with a cortado. 

Highly recommend if seeking a little caffeine fix."}
{"text":"A great local coffee shop located in the Lansdowne/Wallace area.  The place to go was previously Cafe Neon, but after I found out about Wallace Espresso, this is my new spot for caffeine in the West End.  It's small and they barely have any room to stand let alone sit, but I'm always on the go, so it's perfect. 

The service is quick, but there's often a line up and with only one barista you'll have to wait a bit.  Most of the servers are friendly and I must say the choice of music is always great.  I love drinking my Flat White while Schoolboy Q plays in the background.

With any size drip coffee @ $2 and the best Flat White  on the West End, this place is a bargain compared to Cafe Neon and even Starbucks.  They've got my business!"}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall coffee place. I visited yesterday at 5 while walking the wee Beastie and needing my Java fix. I've lived in the area for 3 years but the local coffeeshop thing has only started since having the dog. I got a good vibe from the shop , friendly staff, and decent and cheap $2 drip coffee.  I will report back when I have something more expensive like a latte."}
{"text":"The best coffee shop in the neighborhood! I go to Wallace Espresso daily for the delicious coffee and friendly baristas. Heads up its cash only! The owner Dan is the absolute best, and created a welcoming and awesome environment staffed by friendly, wonderful people. You get love in every coffee cup and the perfect start to your day:) GO HERE! Doesn't get better than WE."}
{"text":"Was a lovely small cafe. Would like it better if they have more seats."}
{"text":"Everytime i go to the gym, i always go to this spot. Coffee is great and the baristas are awesome. Also, tried the pastries and danish that they have and its worth it to pair with their coffee. My favorite is the quinoa cookies. Addition to that, the coffee has consistent taste when they make it. Unlike, some of coffee shops that one day is bitter and another day is flat."}
{"text":"Ew. Honestly I had heard great things, so maybe it was just my experience. But I've gone twice now. Here's the deal:

1) The service sucks. The brunette girl working the mornings clearly does not want to be there and must hate her job. She's rude, cold,1 and just makes your day feel more dreary than anything. You ask her a question and she's just so snooty, like I must be a total idiot for asking.

2) The croissants are stale. Being a bit of a self-proclaimed croissant connoisseur, I would say the croissant quality is actually probably quite good. However after getting a croissant on two different days, it's clear they are incredibly stale. Maybe they are taking croissants from a good place and selling them 3 days later? Either ways...garbage. 

3) The coffee is actually pretty good, but there are equal/better places to get coffee without the issue of crappy service and stale food."}
{"text":"Best coffee in the junction triangle! I will go out of my way to drop into Wallace simply because their coffee is really that good.  It is also the cheapest cortado I've found in Toronto! They also have fresh croissants daily which go fast! The service is really great and generally the place has a great vibe. I occasionally drop into their other location on Wallace avenue which is pretty small, but still awesome!"}
{"text":"Unpretentious, damn-good coffee. Tasty cookies too."}
{"text":"Good strong coffee, without tasting burnt or acidic.  They have delicious looking cookies and treats.  Tiny little place with a couple of chairs by a window and a small bench. More a take-out sort of spot. Considerate and friendly guy behind the counter, seems to know a lot of the people who come through, remembering their name and their usual order.  He feels like a good addition to the local community, not just another coffee shop.   Cash only. My Cappuccino was $3, and an Americano cost me $2."}
{"text":"First off, I love Wallace Espresso. I live only a few mins from their other location on Wallace and I go there all the time. Today was my first time visiting the Dupont location. I left a bit disappointed. I ordered a Flat White and for some reason it was served in a small paper cup, only half full. No idea why. I just took it, drank it, and didn't ask. But I'm still trying to figure out why I only got half a cup. Maybe she thought I ask for a macchiato, or maybe she just ran out of milk. Lol oh well, I'll stick to the Wallace Ave location. I always get a full cup there."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee.  Amazing food.  Amazing people.  It doesn't get much better than Wallace Espresso.  Thank you for being you"}
{"text":"The best cappuccino in the city See for yourself very affordable and always consistent. Dan and his staff are always excellent with their service and hospitality. come in and enjoy a five-star cappuccino."}
{"text":"Really quaint place with good coffee and bakings. I tried their quinoa cookie but their chocolate dipped muffin looks really good too. Nice staff and cool clients."}
{"text":"My new fav place for my lattes! Great price ($3), friendly staff, and the decor is great. It certainly feels like a treat. It'd be great if they offer more desserts"}
{"text":"Many times I wake up on the weekend and realize I don't have any coffee and/or milk. So this is my go-to spot to grab a couple large cups and some delicious banana bread or muffin -- and they're only a few steps down from my house!

Coffee is really good. All the snacks I've had there are also tasty. I've never been disappointed in either, and the staff are always nice and friendly. Great spot."}
{"text":"I've lived up the street from this place since it opened and I'm a little embarrassed to say I only started going recently. 

If we're being honest, a caffeine allergy usually keeps me away from coffee despite my love of the perfect cup but this past week I've been on a consequences-be-dammed tear and giving in to the urge despite the feeling gross afterward. 

But allergies aside, this place offers a simply fantastic no bullshit good quality cup. The lattes and flat whites are well crafted and well priced ($3-3.50) and the barista knows what he's doing. I haven't tried the pastries but they do look fantastic. 

It's a great little spot and very highly recommended. Check it out!"}
{"text":"My favourite local coffee shop. Definitely more of a grab and go place as they only have two stools and a bench. Any size drip coffee for $2 and lattes are $3.50. They use Social beans for their drinks, the dark roast from Mexico is pretty good. The quality of steamed milk depends on who is working, but I can't say I've ever had a bad latte from there."}
{"text":"Best espresso in Toronto hands down. Friendly service and also so much more affordable than any of espresso shops in queen/spadina, west queen west, bloor/bathurst areas."}
{"text":"A teensie weensie coffee joint on the corner of dupont and edwin. Drip coffee and espresso based drinks. The quality is great and the service is good. Snacks and treats also available but the selection is quite small. Good americano and latte. No fuss or frills but great for a pop-in!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars ... price is decent value and it appears to be a nice little neighbourhood spot.  Quick note... cash only!

Wallace Espresso is a quiet little place that seems to cater well to the neighbourhood.  Nothing pretentious ... no gimmicks or fussy drinks.  Just good cups poured for you.  The place itself is quite small with no real seating and a bit bare bones.  There is a tiny bar stool seating for 2 in the front but that's it.  In the warmer moments, they do have several benches outside for you to sit on the side walks.  Service here is prompt and polite.

Flat White - I always appreciate when the barista spends the time to make a really great latte art.  This one does stand out as one of the better ones lately.  As for flavour, it was much better than the one we had that morning.  This bean was acidic and mildly bitter but not too sour ... personally I like a deeper flavour towards the nuttiness.  I dont think this is a bad cup at all but not my personal coffee bean favourite.  3.5/5

Overall, cute little spot and I can understand the local neighborhood love. For everyone else, if you're in the neighbourhood this would be a decent spot to try but for me, I may try other spots before heading back to this one."}
{"text":"On my way to the subway station I would drop by the little hole in the wall for an amazing shot of espresso!"}
{"text":"Pretty good coffee, no menu allows for creativity. Cash only Cafe. More details at dear crema blog."}
{"text":"Wallace Espresso is located in a quiet neighborhood of Junction Triangle situated at Lansdowne and Wallace. A 5 min walk away from the subway, this small, yet charming coffee shop makes stellar espresso based drinks and $2 drip coffees. I decided to head over to the cafe on the weekend.

The shop is fairly small and has minimal seating if you do decide to stay to enjoy your caffeine. The cafe is mostly a grab and go place and during my short visit there I saw people coming in and out to grab their daily fuel fix. I ordered a cappuccino and was asked if I wanted a medium or dark roast. My cappuccino was quickly made and very good. Will come back for more if I am around the area. Great little gem!"}
