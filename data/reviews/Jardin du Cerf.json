{"text":"I was a tourist who did not realize this was a canadian\american style chinese restaurant, I saw roast pork on rice and thought it was hong kong style. it wasnt. i think the kitchen started to make roast pork fried rice and tossed it once i clarified what i wanted. they still dumped a bunch of corn starchy veggies on it. it was not what i wanted but it didn't taste that bad and was cheap."}
{"text":"Short and sweet: Great service, but does not make up for the fact that they used rotten ingredients.   The bell pepper they used was bitter; we later found out after going through more than half the dish that the bell pepper was rotting. A piece was super soft and black, and it's not because it was burnt; it was a rotting part of the pepper!!! Also, the water chestnuts they used had gone bad...it had a sour aftertaste, and a pungent smell...  Any place that uses rotten ingredients only gets 1 star.   This place is located really close to China town- not inside it, but just a sidewalk crossing away from the China town \"gate\". It's a very old restaurant, and it has really gone downhill. You will find much better places inside China town. Btw, China town has, for no particular reason, a bunch of Pho places with pretty much the same offerings; just thought that was strange..."}
{"text":"We came across this place looking for a light meal in the middle of the afternoon, which can surprisingly be difficult in the area as many places close 2:30-5:00. We were happy with our choice! The food was quite good, large portion, and very reasonable. The noodle soup was especially good. Note the restaurant accepts cash only."}
{"text":"This is the same restaurant as \"Deer Garden Restaurant\". I am just adding my review for the sake of helping out the poor sap who stumbled upon this link.  As I am spending over 4 weeks in Montreal from out of town, I did not know where to look to eat that wasn't in the area mall complex.  Restaurant hunting alone for me meant that: - the place can't look dead inside (this is so that staff don't feel obligated to talk to me, as I certainly don't want to talk to anyone after a full day of training) - it had to be on some of the main strips - it needed to be in proximity to the Desjardins Complex and my hotel  Having walked up and down the streets around my area a few nights in a row, I decided to finally settle on Deer Garden Restaurant. This restaurant is located right across the street from my Hotel, the Zero 1, as well as 2 minutes away from the Desjardins Complex. As I was already on foot, it was easy to get to. Parking as a rule seems to be a pain in the ass in this city, and there is none available around here it seems that would be cost effective.  Deer Garden is an oriental restaurant. But you can bring your own beer! Beer-Deer!! The sign says it on the door! I should go back and take a picture!! How many more exclamation points can I fit in this paragraph?!!  They appear to have a lunch menu, as well as a Table d'Hote for evenings where your meal comes with soup, a roll, as well as your main portion of veggies, meats, and rice. Your supper table d'hote is 15.95, though browsing through the menu I did see other meals available for half that (but with less to go with it, I am sure).  When I was seated, they placed a menu, a paper, and a pen at my table. I was confused. Do I write my order? Will the waitress come and use this paper to write what I want? Well, after deciding on what I would eat (Thai Chicken), the waitress came over after I signaled her (it is a very small little restaurant, and she was waiting off to the side for me) and used the paper to write down what I wanted. Fwwwweewwww! Crisis averted.  They brought out tea, rolls and soup right away (and not in that order). I was pleased with how quick and arrived. I ate slowly while reading a book. There are approximately 15 tables around me and a wide variety of people eating at the restaurant. I was the only singleton.  Then my plate of veggies arrived. I took a few bites... very hot! But, disappointingly, the sauce that the veggies had been sitting in tasted a little like sock water. Hot sock water. I wasn't sure if it was my taste buds, or the dish. To be safe, I then mixed it in with the rice and thai chicken that came shortly after. This was a very large plate. After that I was pretty satisfied with what I was eating.  I kept reading and eating and wasn't bothered much after that.   I finished up, and looked at my watch. Only 25 minutes had past since I first sat down. I wasn't sure if I was happy or disappointed.  In summary, this restaurant actually looks like people eat there, they are fast at coming out with the dishes, the main dish is HUGE, nothing was really exceptional taste-wish, they only take cash, parking isn't accessible, and you're in and out quickly. I'm not really sure that I would go back and order from their table d'hote unless in the company of others. I can't help but feel like the time-money value wasn't there. I did see the Pad Thai Chicken on the menu for about 9$, so I will be sure to update this review with my next, hopefully more cost-effective, experience!"}
{"text":"I like the food here. Taste good but not expensive. Every one got a cup of tea. Importantly, we can bring our own win to have party!"}
{"text":"Horrible food. Vegetables are cut way too big and it's just not authentic. It lacks taste. It's so bland. I want my money back."}
{"text":"We tried the General Tso's chicken which was so crispy on the outside and yummy goodness of chicken on the inside, not too spicy - AMAZING. We also tried the house fried rice Tso Yon - awesome. The beef friend noodles, not so good. Highly recommend it, decor is cheesy cheap standard takeout Chinese restaurant type but the food is over the top."}
{"text":"Canadianized...but not too bad! typical Chinese food taste in the US or Canada, sweet, sour, sweet, and sour....that is it!"}
