{"text":"Quite simply: Not a good burger.   Forgive me, but I think if you're going to call yourself Gourmet Burger Co, your mainstay burger should be passable.   I honestly don't remember the last time I had a 'tough' burger before today. Lots of little hard bits. Just not quality beef. The bun is sort of dry and the tomatoes are green.   Staff was nice and salad was good (thankfully), but definitely not a repeat performance."}
{"text":"I wanted to try their \"POUTINE\" and sadly enough I should have just walked away from \"The Gourmet Burger & Co. It cost me $6.72 for something that they sell at New York Fries for $5.37 and I actually get cheese curds and gravy with it. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM \"The Gourmet Burger\" OVER-PRICED AND CRAPPY FOOD QUANTITY!  Will post pictures as a comparison and hopefully franchise owners get to see how they rip off people."}
{"text":"Best sweet potato fries ever! Thin cut, crispy, perfectly salted. This is the kind of fry that needs no dipping in any type of sauce.  Really like the burgers too. The buns are fresh, the ratio of meat to bread is just right. My favourite combination of possibilities pre-listed on the board would be the Cajun burger(satifying balance of heat and flavour). To top it all off they have a wide variety of free toppings including avocado, and sauteed mushrooms! and a great selection of cheeses. I hear the double smoked bacon is amazing as well.  The Chocolate milkshake was refreshing, but very \"i-am-made-out-of-Chapmans-icecream\"-ish. I prefer the old-school creamier one at Sliders.  Try not to go with a big group, space is tight. Or better, get takeout."}
{"text":"Good burgers, great fries, friendly fast service... just what you want in a burger place"}
{"text":"Like this place. They have great beer battered onion rings, and sweet potato fries. The burgers are a little above average.  Small place, always bought take-out. It's good for a quick meal. Friendly service, the prices are ok."}
{"text":"The good things - nice decor, quick & pleasant service, excellent crispy & flavorful onion rings & sweet potato fries.  The bad things - I had the mushroom melt burger.  I found it tasteless and the burger patty was chewy & dry (and not in a good way).  I also had a chocolate milkshake which was listed as \"old style thick shake with 2 scoops of premium ice cream\".  Maybe they were small scoops b/c my milkshake was the consistency of chocolate milk.  And premium ice cream?  I think not.  It tasted like that no name ice cream that comes in big plastic tubs at the supermarket.Not worth the $3.25 they charged for it.  The not so good thing - Their menu says toppings & sauces complimentary.  So I was surprised when I was charged an extra $0.50 for a side of mayo to go with my sweet potato fries.  So much for \"complimentary\".    Not worth the $15 I spent for my meal.  Harvey's would have been just as good.  And I don't even like Harvey's."}
{"text":"I've been to this location both as a meat eater and as a vegetarian. I've had their regular burgers, beef and chicken, and they were both fantastic. Fries? Superlative.   Since becoming a vegetarian, veggie burgers are high on my list. Unfortunately GBC's veggie burger is bland, boring and forgettable. I actually felt kind of sick after eating it. It tasted like rubber bands. Furthermore, they don't have a vegetarian gravy, so I'm unable to enjoy a poutine.   For a company touting they are a \"gourmet burger company,\" it strikes me as odd that their vegetarian offerings are horrible. One would believe they would be excellent in all burger offerings."}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the unfamiliar toppings on the Aussie burger - it's exactly what a burger is supposed to be constructed with.  The burgers are fantastic. 1 star off for not having more than a handful of seats."}
{"text":"I ordered the fish burger and sweet potatoe fries.  Fish was not fresh and deep fried in old oil.  The tartar sauce was horrible.  Sweet potatoe fries was ok, but you can tell it was frozen.  It didn't help that the oil was old.  Never again....you are better off going to McDonalds."}
{"text":"I'll describe the customer service fail first.  Ordered a burger and fries, and was asked if I wanted a drink, which I declined.  After paying, and while I'm waiting for my food, I notice a sign that says if I buy a burger and a Jones Soda, I get free fries.  I look up at the menu and notice that the Jones Soda actually costs less than the fries.  So I ask if I'm reading this right, and if my meal would have been cheaper with the drink than without, and he tells me yes...but.  He then proceeds to tell me that I would have needed to order the Jones Soda when I ordered my burger and that there was nothing he could do to fix that.  Can't reverse the charge and re-sell me the burger and the jones soda with the free fries...just, \"sorry, nothing I can do\" from which I hear \"tough shit...you shoulda read the sign earlier\"  So essentially I paid an extra fifty cents to NOT have a Jones Soda with my burger and fries.  I think that alone likely pissed me off enough to not want to go back.  Onto the food.  The fries were really good.  The works burger was so-so.  It got a bit squished and soggy on my ten minute walk home.  Not as much as I would have hoped for in the way of toppings.  We've been spoiled by one place we used to go when we lived in the St. Lawrence Market area that never disappointed.  Ah well."}
{"text":"Did many dinner orders from here when I worked a block away. The real win at GBC is their homemade ice cream sandwiches. Great ice cream between two gourmet cookies. If only there was a way to warm up the cookies without melting the ice cream...  I think their complete menu is done really well. Burgers are good (not super-awesome, but solid). Onion rings and poutine is good. Shakes are great. They're pretty timely with orders, whether you do a large order for pick up or eat in. If you choose to eat there, they have a balcony from where you can people watch :).  Solid joint."}
{"text":"In a word: delicious. The burger itself actually isn't that great... kind of sawdusty, flat and hard, not particularly juicy. But the toppings... oh, the toppings! Fantastic cheese, double-smoked bacon, great sauces and avocado (free, unlike at other places). Plus amazing sweet potato fries and friendly service. Perfect to pick up for a casual night in."}
{"text":"I went to the new store at Yonge & Eglinton. GREAT burgers. AMAZING hand-cut fries - not greasy.  Nice staff, organized and clean.  LOVE IT.  Great value and good choice for quick and easy meal."}
{"text":"I ordered the Aussie (GBC burger with fried egg, bacon and pineapple) which came out to just under $10 after tax. Fairly reasonable price for a \"gourmet burger\" which is supposedly fresh (i.e. unfrozen) beef. There was just a bit too much miss for me. The fried egg was quite over-cooked (yolk ought to be gooey), the beef was far from juicy and tender, and the bacon came in less than ample portions. Well below the upper-echelon of burgers in T.O. Give me the Priest anyday, even with the inflated price tag!"}
{"text":"Wish I could say more but it's true, I've experienced MUCH better. Gourmet Burger enticed me with their gourmet-ness, half rustic-half sleek decor and their almost unlimited amount of complimentary premium toppings like caramelized onions and roasted red peppers.   I ordered a beef burger, whole wheat bun, with avocado, caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, tomato and chipotle mayo. Should be a slam dunk, right? Not quite.   When you put cold toppings on a burger, the burger gets cold. This burger was also a bit dry and the chipotle mayo had little to no zing. Oddly enough, I was the biggest fan of the bun. It had a great, fluffy texture and whole-wheaty taste.   Service wasn't what I'd call enthousiastic but we got the burgers pretty quickly. Time to freshen things up, GB. I have faith in you!"}
{"text":"Good burgers, fries are quite tasty. Make sure to order lots of toppings. The aussie burger is tasty."}
{"text":"It's a nice, solid burger, for the price. I found that the ingredients were fresher than that of certain competitors (i.e the lettuce was a dark green and actually looked fresh). The burger was good, but it was a different kind of good. By that I mean it didn't taste like a Hero Burger's patty, but it was good in its own way. The service was great; it's definitely an above-average burger place in my opinion."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in both their veggie burger and onion rings.  Even Harvey's is way better. Harvey's is priced better too.    Update Apr 2013 - I had there bacon burger and it was very good - not great...."}
{"text":"The sweet potato fries are super delicious!   The 6oz beef burgers are bit over priced for the sized patty and taste.   I liked that there were options for the bun with either white or wheat.     The signature burgers give a solid selection of different combinations with delectable additions.     To give context my favorite burgers are In N' Out, Culvers, Five Guys and Bongo Burgers and Barney's Burgers (California)."}
{"text":"Stopped by here by chance (Fish Market & Open Kitchen was closed!)  Ordered a veggie burger & sweet potato fries. The portion of sweet potato fries was a lot but very delicious! The veggie burger held up very well and overall, it was a great tasting veggie burger. A lot of places fail on putting out a proper veggie burger (one that holds together) and I think GBC has done it well.  But for the price I paid (~$11, combo), I would've just went back to another place for a beef burger. Recently discovered a place called Sequel Catering (which none of my friends know about). That simply TOPS ALL burgers in my opinion. Like other reviewers have said, it's not that much different from burgers at Hero or even South St."}
{"text":"Let's be honest; slapping the word \"gourmet\" on something doesn't make it any better than it actually is. GBC offers over-priced run of the mill burgers with no frills simplistic branding (which I dig). I mean, the burgers are decent but I've had better. On the plus side, their fries and onion rings are money in the bank!  Also, seating is quiet limited so consider yourself lucky if you get a spot during lunch hour. Eating on a Cabbagetown curbside isn't usually that fun.   In the end, it's a viable burger option if your in the neighbor but nothing to write home about. Seth Godin was right, marketers are liars because there's nothing gourmet about GBC."}
{"text":"Gourmet is great place to grab lunch and is pretty close to my school. They have a amazing sweet potato fries and the GBC burger is great, it's sorta like south burger co. Which is around the corner from there, but the price to high tho for a burger. But very small space especially during lunch hours be sure to pack it to go otherwise your gonna be standing eating your food!"}
{"text":"Worst burger joint EVER! The staff was very rude.        Anyways here is the story, I was at this joint with my friend. He doesn't have enough money so he asked me to pay for his burger. So I did, and I asked the cashier if it's possible for her to add $5 do the bill so she can give me a $5 bill from the cash register (I know it's absurd and it's probably not possible, but I really need a $5 bill at the time). At first, she didn't quite get my idea, then the store manager came out. He said that I can't do that (with an unpleasant face), of course I was expecting that. So I told him that I'll pay now. Then he just threw the debit card terminal at me and turned around not saying a word. He also gave me a very disrespectful face. After I paid, I left the store because I was enraged by how he treated me.   After I left, my friend got the burger, soon that store manager told him to leave. My friend said \"no\" because there is no reason for him to leave, he didn't cause any trouble inside the joint. Then the store manager shouted at him, he said \"get the fuck out\" and literally dragged him outside.    This is THE worst service I had to date. And I certainly would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"With the burgeoning of burger joints around Toronto, I was excited to go here.  It has all sorts of good word of mouth...but I was disapointed and probably wouldnt go again.    Ordered a lamb burger that was pretty flavorless.  The fries were limp and pretty flavorless as well.  I don't think it was worth the ten bucks when places like Craft Burger are around.  Overall, its ok if you're gonna grab a quick bite, but I wouldn't go out of the way to go there."}
{"text":"I'm always fascinated by fancy burger places. Like...what can you do to a burger to make it amazing????  Gourmet burger offers up a yummy selection of meats and toppings.  You can get beef, chicken, lamb or vegetarian.  The service was great and easy-going, and they were happy to suggest fun topping combinations for your burger.  The beef burger was shaped into a flat patty, and they piled on your selected toppings generously.  This was a messy meal, but I went home satisfied. Yes, it was a bit greasy, but nothing unexpected.  I also had the onion rings - very big and crispy.  I think that the onion ring is my new french fry.  If it's a choice between this place and South St Burger (located just south of Gourmet Burger), I would come here instead."}
{"text":"So very disappointing.  Got the Works but requested a fried egg on top to take it over the edge, but all I got was a pile of sadness.  The burger had no real flavour and lacked any kind've personality.  Cold buns sandwiching bland beef with indistinguishable toppings.   The smoked burger was over the top smoked and that's all you could taste.  I knew there was meat in there because the menu said there was but I couldn't taste it.  fml.  The fries in the poutine were great, too bad I ordered poutine so you'd expect a healthy amount of gravy and cheese. But no.  Couple of un-melted curds and barely enough gravy to penetrate the fries 1 layer down.  Onion rings were soggy.  End of story. At least I got to learn some history on Cabbagetown so all was not lost."}
{"text":"This place is actually called GBC.. It's yummy, service is fast and the only place to get an Aussie burger in town :)"}
{"text":"Another contender for burgers not 5 minutes from my friends apartment. She noticed this place popped up a few weeks ago and wanted to try it before we left for Montreal. I ordered the Aussi Burger and she made something up using mushrooms and cheeses. The burgers themselves were tasty but definitely greasy. In the sunlight the buns shimmered as though I was staring at a tranquil lake. The fries we ordered came in a Chinese takeout box and were nothing too special. I enjoyed my burger however the friend said hers was a little on the dry side. Quite a feat seeing the amount of grease that was everywhere. All the burgers are made to order so when you come in here expect to wait 10 or so minutes while everything is prepared. There is no fountain sodas only a case of various beverages ranging from coke, teas, and water.  Surroundings are small but adequate. Flat screen TV off to the left, a nice sized bar in front of the window to people watch. All high tops that are pretty comfy. We had a pretty good meal, I could probably come here again to give them another shot."}
{"text":"So this is how the story goes:  I love burgers, I love me some french fries, and some beer battered onion rings~  If the above describes you, you need to run over to Gourmet Burger Co.  You can build your own, but I like going for the Signature Burgers.  This time it's Spicy Cajun Burger:  this bad boy comes with Jalapeno Havarti, WHAT? Avocado with Cajun spice & Smokey chipotle & Honey mayo!  WHAT?  I know, awesome right?  I like going for the Onion Rings, but not all the time b/c they are soooo rich...  oh, these are not your average onion rings folks, these are beer battered massive work of art!  The burger + Onion rings and drink combo = total of around 12 bucks give or take  Not inexpensive, but why not treat yo self? with a fantastic burger from Gourmet Burger Co."}
{"text":"Great burger!  Big, fresh quality toppings, fresh cut fries, good service.  Small place with limited counter seating.  Onion rings, sweet potato fries and homemade ice cream sandwiches also very good!"}
{"text":"I want my GBC.  I love burgers. I really do. I will search out almost high and low for them and in my recent travels I came across the Gourmet Burger Company.  And what a find.  Gourmet burgers not priced out of this world, yet such succulent, juicy patties and mouth watering combinations.  I could not imagine a better way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon than grazing on one of the GBC's burgers.  My first foray to the GBC took me to the Mushroom Melt:  the 100% GBC beef patty, lettuce, tomato, portobello and sauteed mushrooms with Brie cheese. Mmmmm.  I held on the mayonnaise; I wanted nothing to interfere with the taste and texture of the Brie cheese.  The fries, tasted fresh; they were cut that very AM.  Much more delicious than most fast food chains, and much better than NYF.  These fries were cooked to perfection - I don't know if they were baked or cooked or deep fried - but they were not oily or heavy as some other french fries I have had.  The GBC sauce is a nice twist on most sauces. Going forward, I will always take my fries with ketchup (I see french fries as a ketchup-delivery vehicle more than anything else), but the GBC sauce was a nice change of pace: tangy and sweet at the same time.  The burger itself is quite filling, so if you can, share the fries with someone else, for no other reason than to have the ice cream sandwich, one of my weaknesses.  I swear, the ad for it looks so tantalizing that I almost ordered the ice cream sandwich instead of the burger.  For $3.25 you get two delicious cookies filled with premium ice cream. I had vanilla, and I could taste how different it was from most store-bought ice creams.  The cookies were good, and while my preference is for softer cookies,  I found out that softer ones usually crumble and leave you with an ice cream mess.  The proprietor, Raffi, is what all good ol' fashioned burger chains should have: someone to walk you through the different options and regale you with tales of burgers, local politics and entrepreneurship.   As Ahnold once said \"I'll be back\"."}
{"text":"Great burger and tons of fried. The combo was really worth it.   Decent price and left me full.  There are def better burgers in Toronto but worth a try."}
{"text":"Toppings - Yum!  During peak meal times, this place gets crowded - fast.  A great assortment of free 'fancy' toppings on burgers means you can customize to your delight without spending $16 on a suped-up burger!  I always order mine with everything, which means I usually have issues maintaining my graceful, ladylike appearance. It's always worth it.  The sweet potato fries are good, but the onion rings are great. Order those with a side of chipotle honey mayo, and you will feel complete."}
{"text":"I had the Smokey something burger; the meat in the patty was kind-of tough and over-salted without much flavour. Couldn't taste the cheese, the garlic mayo just tasted like mayo, and the bun was just okay.   Super-friendly service.  I'd go back to try something else, because there are so many great reviews that maybe I just got an off burger. But it definitely seems like salt was standing in for flavour."}
{"text":"I'm kinda feeling like Goldilocks and the three burgers. The 8 ounce patty at the Yellow Griffin was too big, the 4 ounce patty at the Burger Bar was too small but the 6 ounce patty at the Gourmet Burger Co. was just right.   I'm digging the burgers at Gourmet Burger Co. The 6 ounce patty had some really lovely smoke coming out in the flavour which was very distinct. For a change the meat wasn't completely overpowered by those goopy, gluey house sauces that plague the burgers at Hero or Acme. This burger was perfectly cooked, crispy and slightly caramelized at the edges but still juicy. They use the same kind of buns as Craft Burger which aren't super fat, just right for their 6 ounce patties.   I also really liked the assortment of freebie toppings you can indulge in. Can't honestly say I'd rush to add beets to my meats but the caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, avocados and roasted red peppers are great options. No extra charge for those toppings (take note Craft Burger!!!!) There is a burger combination for just about every set of taste buds. The toppings that add to the bottom line include a choice of 6 different cheese, double smoked bacon, portobello mushrooms and pea meal. I ordered a slab of brie and they put it on the bottom of the bun putting the patty on top so when I bit in I got this oozing, soft brie that was perfect with caramelized onions and sauteed mushrooms.   We ordered two combo's, both had cheese add ons and the bill came out to $22 bucks and this included some beverages. GBC rocked the fries but I was meh on the sweet potato fries. Previous reviews raved about the SPF's but I'm convinced they've been coated or pre-treated with something. I must preferred the SPF's at the Original Motorcycle Burger spot, at least they were, in my opinion, honest SPF's.   I really liked the GBC. Other than the fact that this spot is not much larger than my shoe closet (there are seats for about 10 people) it's a kick ass little burger spot. I can honestly say I think I've found a burger spot I like better than my most beloved Craft Burgers. Sorry CBs, but it's time to stop charging for those caramelized onions & mushrooms!"}
{"text":"The Good:  They have a small burger combo (it is small); they claim to be environmentally friendly, source locally and are powered by Bullfrog Power, which is a green, renewable energy provider. If you like Crush soda pop, they have it in stock.   The Mediocre: It's not a special burger. I see no distinguishable difference with Hero Burgers, in terms of selection, taste and fries. Even Crush tasted flat. I used to like that soda pop as a kid.  Is it really gourmet?  No.  Next time I want a gourmet burger, I will head to Coquine's and order their slider. I don;t mind the small size, I just want flavour and taste, which \"Gourmet\" Burger is seriously lacking."}
{"text":"The Man at the cash was actig like he was tweaking on something,  texting and generally irritable and impatient.  If you can get past the junky at the front the chicken burger was yummy..."}
{"text":"I changed it up today and got the chicken burger.  Its nice to see things like avocado, mushrooms, and carmelized onions as part of the topping list and not an extra charge.  The place is small with only a few tables and clearly we had just missed the lunch rush as the tables were a little messy.    The food was tasty, especially the sweet potato fries.    Overall a great place to grab an upscale burger."}
{"text":"We were running around trying to find a place to eat last Wednesday for dinner.  We ended up somehow in front of GBC, and I was craving a burger.  My friend ordered \"The works\" and I ordered the \"Smoke bacon burger\" containing 6oz GBC 100% beef burger, lettuce, tomatoes, double smoked bacon, Smoked Gouda, roasted garlic Dijon mustard mayo... I just really wanted smoked bacon.  I realized later that I should've just ordered a burger with my own choices of toppings; however, the burger was still delectable.  We also had the poutine -- I was pretty happy with the poutine considering I was craving it like mad that day.  However, I wouldnt' call these burgers really THAT gourmet.  Still delicious though."}
{"text":"Veg burger with the works minus relish plus a nice slice o' brie.  People...you must try their burgers.  The veg patty was really tasty although a bit loose and crumbly but it's really the complimentary toppings like mashed avocado, carmelized onions and sauteed mushrooms not to mention the additional toppings like jalapeno harvarti and brie that make this veg burger the best I've eaten so far in Toronto.  I also got the regular 6 oz beef burger for a bunch of friends and they also concluded that it was one of the best burgers they'd ever eaten.  I will say that it was incredibly filling.  I had to take a significant break half way through my burger and It's been 7 hours and I'm still achingly full.  The sweet potato fries were a little limp for my liking and the onion rings were a little oil-logged but the burgers are totally amazing!  Gotta try the Aussie toppings next time.  The cashier was real sweet and did not get annoyed that I was desperately trying to get an order together over my cell phone for 3 other people while holding up the line.  Check it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had GBC beef and sweet potato fries. The beef was done just about right and the fries were not over-cooked. Overall, it was a great meal!"}
{"text":"Horribly impatient and rude server. He was obviously upset with something (slamming fridge doors, slamming down the phone, constantly shaking his head), but that's no excuse to take it out on customers and even other staff. My burger was about average, nothing \"gourmet\" IMO, and the fries tasted burnt. 3 stars for the food, 1 star for the service."}
{"text":"The Aussie Burger is great Try it. If you don't, have something with cheese and bacon on it and don't forget the pickled beets. The fries are good as are the sweet potato fries.  Better than Burger Shoppe. As good as Burger Shoppe Quality Meats (on Ossington.) Better than Dangerous Dan's.  Not much seating.  http://www.blogto.com/restaurants/the_gourmet_burger_company"}
{"text":"Ordered a classic with jalapeño Havarti on whole wheat and sat by the window awaiting my burger. It was grilled, the bun was fresh, the Parliament view was interesting and it was less than $10.  I would return, although the patty was a bit smaller than I anticipated. Still, good burger, sits in my Top 5 upon first visit."}
{"text":"Came here this afternoon to grab lunch (01.21.11) as I work in the area. I pass by this place daily on the way home and was always intrigued.   When you first walk in, you smell the hamburgers on the grill ... mmmm. Staff members were quite friendly and explained to me how Gourmet Burger works as it was my first time here.  I ordered the regular burger ($5.50) and had all the complimentary toppings put into it. I had to wait a few minutes for the burger, but luckily there is seating with comfortable chairs so I didn't mind.   The burger was a-ok, it didn't knock me off my feet.... it did the trick though. I was no longer hungry.  Next time, I would love to try their poutine... the guy next to me was eating it, but obvi you can't ask a complete stranger if you can try some..."}
{"text":"Never had bad service or a bad meal at this Gourmet Burger Co establishment yet. The servers always bring my girlfriend and I our food. They ALWAYS ask how our food is. They ALWAYS have said goodbye. Which is solid customer service.  I usually tend to pick from their specialized combo's where as my girlfriend is obsessed with their fish burgers.  The only downside is the seating is not that comfortable. However its more than comfortable enough for you to enjoy your meal.  This is definitely coming from a return customer."}
{"text":"You know what I love about this place (other than the delicious burgers)? They have hand sanitizer at the counter. Such a brilliant idea (hello, flu season is not over yet!). I was riding on the College streetcar to GBC and thinking about how germ-y those streetcar poles are and then thinking that I was about to eat with my hands... Never have I been so relieved to see a little Purell.   Otherwise --  - I had the 6 oz beef burger with roasted red peppers, sauteed mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, and GBC sauce. All those toppings were free too. I think compared to other places, GBC's selection of free toppings is a lot better. The burger was juicy and delicious.  -You can choose a white or whole wheat bun.  - I made it a combo with a small mixed greens salad and mango nectar ($1 extra, the combo normally comes with a can of pop). Salad was decent, came with balsamic vinaigrette and some chopped carrots and sunflower seeds.  - They make the burgers to order, so expect to wait 5-10 mins.  - Small seating area, TV playing CP24, and copies of NOW at the counter. - They have a loyalty card, buy 10 combos, get 1 free."}
{"text":"This burger place was a bit over-hyped. It was packed at lunchtime - luckily my friends had gone a bit earlier to avoid the rush and nabbed a seat. The seating is limited - looks like it's more of a take-out place.  I had read some mixed reviews before going, so I'm not sure if it coloured my opinion, but I have to agree with the reviews that the burger is on the dry side. I like my meats really juicy, and the only juice on the burger was from the bacon (which I have to admit is always good - crispy, dry, juicy - i just love bacon!). The bun that it came on was good, as were the fries, but given the price and packed-ness... I don't think I will making any trips to return soon.  Just to put it into context - my favourite burgers are Shake Shack and Good Burger in NYC - juicy and sooo good! I also love the fries at 5 Guys and their burgers are not bad either."}
{"text":"Mmm, just thinking about this burger place makes me hungry!  Their burgers are nice, thick and juicy and their gravy is so beefy and good.  It's one of those places where I surprise myself and end up eating way more than I probably ought to.    The best thing about this place is the superb customer service, which I have to admit is rare at a burger joint.  I went on a Sunday, ordered a burger and was hoping to pop by the fro-yo place across the street before coming back to pick-up the burger.  Turns out, the fro-yo place was closed and I came back and instead ordered the fries and a Jones cream soda in addition to my burger.  The guy was super nice and even told the cooks in the back to have my fries and burger come out at the same time.  Mmm, the fries were so good too, I will definitely have to try the poutine next time because although Smoke's Poutinery is just a few blocks down, these fries definitely were superior and tasted great alone too."}
{"text":"If you are in the area, certainly worth checking out.  I've been wanting to stop in and finally did today.  Yay, nice warm day in Toronto.  What I liked about it was the different toppings, Gouda, pineapple, etc.  The serving sizes are good and the topping were fresh.  Didn't try the fries (regular or yam) but they looked good.  For some reason I thought this was a sit down place, but it's not.  Very small, and I felt 'in the way' waiting for my order, probably easier just to wait outside on the street.  Hope you are out enjoying the weather, wherever you are in the city:)"}
{"text":"As others have suggested, this place is all about the toppings. The meat itself is plenty tasty though, and the fries are top-notch. I take off one star because I think it's slightly overpriced for a take-out joint (over $10 for burger, fries and drink), and because I think they sometimes cook the patties a little too long, erring on the dry side.  The Aussie burger is interesting but a bit messy for my tastes -- I recommend choosing fewer ingredients unless you like sloppy, messy burgers. You can't go wrong with the smokey bacon burger."}
{"text":"Not a bad burger.  Had the beef burger and it was nice.  A bit dry as it was over cooked.  I liked the toppings they had to offer and especially avocado which brought the burger to life...   Will give them a try again..."}
{"text":"3.5 stars   VIBE I really like the layout of this joint. Right beside the Cupcake Shoppe, the high steel tables and comfortable bar stools make this the perfect place to grab a quick lunch.   WE ATE  I had the mushroom melt and though the mayo wasn't available that day my cashier suggested a substitute that worked fine. My colleague had the big smoke burger and really liked the bacon on his. Burger is greasy like Holy Chuck's but not a lot of flavour. Cooked well though. Yummy fries. If you like salt, like I do, you'll be satisfied.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Not really \"gourmet\" per se, but as everyone else has said, satiates the hunger."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice. Service is friendly but unfortunately the burgers are not up to par for that price point. I would place the quality of this burger at the price point of South Street Burger Co down the street, except that I didn't enjoy it as much as South Street Burger, which is affiliated with New York Fries. The burger was dried out and the patties are very thin. The location on Charles St. makes a better burger but still Gourmet Burger Co. has left me wanting more in a burger. If that Yonge and Eglinton I would much prefer to go to South Street Burger Co. or the Burger Cellar. I had the lamb burger and sweet potato fries, which weren't that great either. They charge you for dip which is funny because all of their signage boasts free toppings. They act like they have a leg up on their competition but their competition, like Craft Burger, doesn't charge for dip. Craft Burger is infinitely better and if you have the occasion I would recommend going there instead."}
{"text":"Are you familiar with that unsettling primordial craving for a burger because you haven't had one in ages (regardless of how long it's actually been)? Likely all too well.  With so many shmancy burger joints popping up on every street corner these days, everyone's always namedropping their new favourites. \"Blah Blah Burger is the best!\" It's been so hard to keep up that I just decided not to even try. Besides, my definition of \"soooo long\" is in fact quite long when it comes to burgers. Until the day that dreaded beef patty craving hit me so hard that it had me going out on the prowl like a mad cave woman, I blissfully didn't know what I was missing out on.  All it took to convince my empty stomached lunch date to go on this burger hunt was the mention of a burger. It didn't take us long to find and agree on the simply, but entirely germanely named Gourmet Burger. We thought that the minimalistic black interior felt quite severe, but also sanitary at the same time.   After too much deliberation that took the span of a six person deep line up, I decided on a smokey bacon burger. We sat on bar stools up against the spic and span storefront window and didn't mind one bit that we were inadvertently providing live advertising while we gorged ourselves half way into food comas. Although the optional whole wheat bun was dense and filling in a way that I could not appreciate, the complimentary creamy avocado and juicy beets did a great job of adding balance to the melange of textures.   It was both literally and figuratively refreshing to find juices such as mango and carrot orange instead of the run of the mill pop. My burger buddy's cheese burger was reportedly amazing and he was stuffed, but I eventually convinced him to finish the third of mine that I didn't have space for too."}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers, though I have to say the patty itself could be more juicy / tasty. Though their inventive toppings are a redeeming factor  The Aussie burger? I mean, what the....I'd never think of topping a burger with fried egg, bacon, cheese, pineapple, and beets, but damn, it works! I like to think of it as a breakfast burger, one that will keep you full for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Having been here three times in the past month I can safely say Gourmet Burger Co. deserves a solid 4 star rating for consistency.  For under $10 ($9.70, to be exact) you can make a combo of any burger - I call that a solid deal. Toppings like beets, avocado, caramelized onions and sauteed mushrooms are graciously included in the price, but cheese is $1 extra (which is fine). They have an excellent assortment of cheese options like goat cheese, brie, smoked gouda, havarti and aged white cheddar. If you're Australian and/or a weirdo you can add pineapple, fried egg or double smoked bacon to your burger too.  I always get a veggie burger combo with avocado and brie or goat cheese, tomatoes and mayo. The burger doesn't appear moments after you order it, which lends credibility to the fact that everything is prepared fresh and is gourmet-ly assembled. The french fries here are homemade and absolutely excellent - same goes for the sweet potato fries. I've never had a bad meal here - the burger tastes just as great from visit to visit.  If you want to buy pop separately it's also reasonably priced at $1.25 per can.  Room for improvement: they'd be smart to just remove the seating altogether and make it a takeout counter only. They keep adding more seating every time I visit and there just isn't any room for it. It's like those people who jam a king-sized bed into a 10x10 room and leave hardly any room to actually walk around the centrepiece."}
{"text":"I often have a dinner companion, Michael K, who when he's in my hood always suggests Gourmet Burger. He effing loves it.  I like it a lot, too, but it is a bit expensive for burgers, and there isn't really room to dine in. So, often my onions rings, or poutine (with real curds!) don't survive the 5 minute walk home without becoming mushy. You know what I'm talking about, take-out fans!   The burgers themselves are delicious, organic with lots of locally sourced toppings. I'm partial to the smoked bacon with blue cheese and hot peppers on the lamburger.  BONUS: All condiments are free. Sucka Free burgers.   NB: Call ahead for your orders, they grill 'em fresh so it takes about 10 minutes."}
