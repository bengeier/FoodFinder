{"text":"Pretty awesome! These ladies family-own and operate, and take care of their customers. They don't count meat when building your sub, and they have Italian wedding soup!"}
{"text":"Eaten here off & on the last few years. They deliver to my office so it's convenient. It's been over a year since I last had their meatball sammie so I ordered it today for take away.   Ten minutes later I'm picking up my lunch, anxious to bite into what I remember being one of the best meatball sammies ever.   There was an odor coming from my bag. I shrugged it off. Must be the sauce. When I arrived at my office - which is literally across the intersection- and opened the box, it didn't look hot. The cheese wasn't fully melted; I could make out that it was shredded. The sauce didn't look heated up; it was chunky. The meatballs were on the colder side of room temp. I smelled & tasted garlic; where it was I'm not sure but it was too much for my liking.   I'm disappointed.   Having never been to the actual shop before today...it's small & cute. I noticed several crock pots with ladles in the kitchen I assumed were keeping the hot sammie contents hot. (Not sure what happened to mine because it wasn't close to hot.)  Everyone was nice & friendly. Huge chip selection. Pepsi products only, so if you're a Coke person like me, beware. Tables were clean. Kitchen was clean.   Just wish my sammie was hot-I'm sure it would have been better than what it was and more fab like I remember it to be. I have half a sammie I'm not sure what to do with right now. It was loaded with meatballs too!  I ordered online. It's $1 delivery fee for across the intersection & a $10 min order. My sammie was $9.50 for a 12 inch. They serve breakfast too...mental note to try that one morning."}
{"text":"Great Subs, quality meats, awesome bread. HUGE portions. Great place for a sub."}
{"text":"In town for an installation. Used Yelp to find this place a couple of blocks away. Go glad I did. The 6\"Philly was huge with a very generous portion of meat, mushrooms, onions, and cheese. The service was great and with a friendly smile. If I lived here I would come over often. Thanks Yelp for the suggestion."}
{"text":"All's I can say is TONY'S BACK!  for those of you that were a part of the Tony era a couple of years ago, you know what that means.  the rest of you need to go and experience what a sub shop should be like for yourself.  The meat and cheeses are fresh (not brownish) and the bread is always fresh never soggy.  Portions sizes a very large so you timid eaters might want to try the 6\" subs at first. Crystal, give them another chance, if you are still out there, you won't be disapointed."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. I love sandwiches and there are a lot of places to get them in this area, but if I can pay the same amount for a quality fresh Ingredient sub why would I ever go to subway? Prices are fair, delivery is prompt. Yes they deliver. For less than 9 dollars for a 12 inch sandwich, everything from cold turkey to philly cheese steak, this is my go to sub spot."}
{"text":"I own a business around the corner from munch a sub and we call them atleast twice a week.  Contrary to past comments, ALL of our subs are always fresh and the bread is the best.  Your subs anywhere really suck if they sit and get old, so order when you get there and enjoy!  A dollar debit fee is hardly worth complaining about...a great mom and pop subshop..."}
{"text":"My office and I have eaten here several times, their food is fresh, quickly prepared and wonderful.  My favorite is their egg salad - just the egg salad, nothing else...and their sub bread is simply wonderful...  too bad we can't purchase it somewhere to use at home.  Staff is very polite and delivery is quick.   Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Good place. Had an Italian #19. As I was trying to figure out what to order I realized several repeat customers were there. I knew this because of the conversations they were having. Staff was very friendly. Order was quick.   So why there instead of any other sub joint?  The Bread!!  Anyone can make a sandwich but the bread was amazing.   The only thing keeping me from giving a five is the price. $8-9 for 6 inch and $9.50+ for 12 inch."}
{"text":"Munch-A-Sub is the best sandwich shop I have tried in Las Vegas, hands down! I first heard about this place from some co-workers who absolutely raved about it. They had their sandwiches at some training they were at and couldn't quite remember the name. when I finally figured out the name I was totally stoked because it turns out Munch-A-Sub is right on the way to work. Sadly though, they close at 4PM and I get off work at 4PM.  So I got off early one day and stopped by and picked up a 12\" roast beef sub with all the fixin's. YEE HAA DADDY! The roast beef was that perfect rosy red medium rare with tons of yummy beefy flavor goodness.  Yesterday I got off early again and took the wife. We shared a 12\" corned beef with cheese and sauerkraut, ruebenish as they called it, that was a hit for both my wife and I. And she's a very picky sandwich eater. Meaning that she is picky about her sandwiches, not that she will only eat picky sandwiches.  The 12\" subs are run around $10, but are worth every penny of that. They are easily twice the sandwich on multiple levels than those of a national sandwich chain that shall remain nameless.  I can't fail to mention the owner and staff; wonderful! Welcoming, gracious, appreciative and helpful.   We will be going back as often as timing allows"}
{"text":"I just ordered two breakfeat burritos and I can't believe it .......this is so good!!! I think this is better then gods virgina and its like a unicorn farted in my face and I was the lucky one to take a wiff"}
{"text":"Everyone knows Vegas is a burger town. The pizza is mediocre and the subs are downright terrible. But I was in the mood for a cold sandwich and just happened to be in the industrial part of town and found Munch A Sub.  The reviews were good, so I stopped in and was pleasantly surprised by the very East Coast vibe the place was giving off. I ordered a sandwich with roast beef, turkey and ham, trying to recreate a classic I grew up with in south Florida. To my surprise, the sandwich was really great.  It all starts with the bread, which is exactly the type of hoagie roll that every sub shop should be using. It was soft on the inside, but perfectly structured on the outside. The meats were a good portion and weren't the typical store bought slices you see around town.  I also ordered a soup, Italian Wedding, which was a great thing to eat alongside a cold sub. One of the owners of the shop, who also took my order, was nice enough to even bring me a meatball for free so I could try it. Needless to say, I'll be ordering the meatball sub next time I'm there.  Overall, this was probably the best sub I've had in my 8 years in Vegas. The Butcher Block over on Rainbow also does subs that are really good, but every time I go there, they act annoyed at the thought of making a sub and it seems like they really only want to sell their meats.  The only real knock I can give Munch A Sub is that they serve Pepsi instead of Coke, but that's just a preference. Oil and red vinegar would also be cool to have out on the tables, but that's just me trying to recreate my favorite sub shop from back home."}
{"text":"Got a turkey club, guess I should have read reviews and I would have known they close at 3pm and the subs are huge. Just do 1/2 six is plenty. Good sandwich, very safe fresh bread, although I'm not sure you can mess up a turkey club. I do prefer carved turkey over deli (what they serve), but can eat both.  Staff friendly got me in and out in 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Eat here on a regular basis. They have good, fresh food served timely. Everyone that works there is friendly.  Calling in orders works perfect as the food is ready at the time they say it is. Highly recommend this spot for breakfast or lunch if your in the area."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time.  Service was friendly and fast considering the number of people there for lunch.  Sandwich was great.  Cost was about $12 for 6\" sub, chips and a drink."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times now.  The first time I came here, I was actually pretty pleased.  The 12\" sub was plenty big and the bags of chips are a good size too.  I had the Italian sub and it was pretty good with fresh bread and good oil and vinaigrette.  So far so good.  I came back a second time, ordered the roast beef and it was not very good and pretty bland.  That wasn't the problem.  I could see right into the kitchen and one of the workers was eating a small piece of a sandwich while leaning over the bins.  If that wasn't bad enough, I saw her dip her finger into a sauce and lick her finger off then go back to making sandwiches.  Yuk!!!  Seriously???    Well, I figured that that probably happens in a lot of places so I came back another day because I was in a hurry and the place is close to my office.  This time, I see the same woman back there eating potato chips.  Neither of the 2 women working there wore gloves.  I saw the other one grabbing handfuls of lettuce and tomato slices out of a bag with her bare hands and putting them in a bin.  The wear no gloves for anything.....    I had the Italian sub again and it was covered with the vinaigrette - way too much - and a ton of pepper.  Very disappointed.  Between the hit or miss quality and disconcerting hygiene I don't think I will ever go back."}
{"text":"No joke one of the best sandwiches in Las Vegas and possibly the West Coast. This place is like the real deli's back east. It's all about the bread. Face it. Any idiot can slice meat and cheese but it takes talent to make great sub bread. This place will not disappoint and btw the 6 inch sub is MONSTER, most grown men I saw there are full off it."}
{"text":"Awesome, huge subs! Good, soft rolls and quality meat. Had a #19 Italian combo. Fast and friendly. A hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Looking for a lunch spot in the area and came across Munch-A-Sub and thought I would give a try. Nice little spot in an industrial area, small area for seating inside. Friendly staff, great menu selection. I had the Italian and loved it. I will be visiting again and trying some of the different sandwich options. If you are looking for a good sandwich place give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I drive by this place almost every day and didn't notice it at first. It's definitely a hole in the wall \"locals\" place. I finally gave it a try and the pastrami #51 gave me more life! This was the best sandwich I've had in a long while and I will definitely be stopping in more often during my commute."}
{"text":"I ordered through eat 24, my food was ready when I got there. The staff was friendly and greeted me as soon as I came in. The place was clean which is important when eating somewhere. The food was good and tasted fresh, the club sandwich was great everything tastes like it was sliced right before the sandwich was made and they were generous with the meat. The salad was big and tasted fresh, usually some places over cook the bacon or it was cooked earlier and they reheat it, their bacon was fresh and cooked perfectly. I will definitely be back to have lunch here!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today. Walking up to the door, you could smell wonderful flavors. When we walked in we were met with a line about 6 or 7 deep. The line cleared up really fast. I ordered the Rueben, my wife ordered the sausage and peppers with added meatballs. Both sandwiches were amazing. We will definitely be going back. The service was excellent and for being as busy as they were it was very quick. The rest of the menu looked awesome as well with a good combo of cold and hot sandwiches, wraps and salads. Great place!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this sandwich shop for 15 years. Not much has changed in that time and that includes the quality...I have not had a bad meal here. #28 is by far my most ordered but I have been getting the Reuben sub lately and couldn't be happier. Still one of the best kept secrets in town."}
{"text":"Holy shit the subs are huge. Whether it is 6\" or 9\" your leaving with a large sandwich. I got the meatball and it was fantastic. Meatballs are flavorful, the dice was great, and the cheese encompasses the meatballs. The bread is soft, prefer toasted, but this sandwich is great."}
{"text":"Awesome, just awesome. Likely the best 12\" cold-cut Italian sub I've had in so many years I can't even remember where that was. So when I ate here, it was sort of like traveling back in time!  When I walked through the door, the smell of the spices from the kitchen filled the whole space (and it's a small space) and it literally made my mouth start watering! I knew right then, before even looking at the menu, that I was in for a real treat.  The sub was gargantuan, a very generous portion of cold cuts, brimming with tomatoes and lettuce and such. And the bread, heavenly tasty, way beyond what is typical found embracing such a sub. The side of potato salad was also very good. Plus a small drink, came in at $10 before tax. The sub menu has plenty of choices, something to please anyone. They also serve several traditional spins on pasta&meat: spaghetti&meatballs, penne&sausage, you know the drill.  Again, it's a pretty small space. Partly of the expected Italian décor, only a light touch of the expected red & white motif. There's some vintage Vegas a bit of Manhattan on the walls that, I expect, speaks to the nostalgia, perhaps the history, of the owners.   Being of sharp business mind, I was also impressed with the business strategy of these owners. This restaurant is buried deep inside a large industrial zone ... I only stumbled in here because I was having some of my custom auto lighting worked on up the street (at 12 Volt Solutions) ... and I didn't see any dining competition anywhere in the neighborhood. A monopoly, sweet. And they deliver, demand for which I expect is constant. And, in harmony with the workforce that surrounds the place, it's open for breakfast at 7, lunch at 11 and dark at 3pm.  A virtual monopoly, superlative product priced as good value, and short working hours to boot - now THERE'S an enviable business strategy.   Not on any main drag, but not too far from one ... and not hard to find. On West Tropicana, near The Orleans, turn south onto Cameron. Then about a half-mile on the left.   Find it."}
{"text":"Great subs, great service, great value.  The whole family enjoyed the place.  If I lived in Vegas I would eat there more often."}
{"text":"Awesome sandos. I'm from the east coast and these were very reminiscent of the kind I had growing up. Great service and delicious tasting meats - thinly sliced and great toppings."}
{"text":"Solid sandwiches, nothing fancy, just straight forward gigantic sandwiches. If you meat, cheese, bread, and condiments, this place is for you."}
{"text":"Munch a sub? More like Massive Subs! This spot is semi-hidden in the warehouse area, and a hot spot for blue-collar boys grabbing lunch. Portions are large and prices are fair, with most 6\" sandwiches clocking in at a mere $8 and change. Menu also offers some soups, pastas, and specials, like chili cheese dogs.  The #43 is a roast beef and turkey combo, with super-fresh bread and an ample amount of meat. My only gripe is that I added provolone and didn't receive it, so maybe this isn't the best place for customized orders. BF was a little underwhelmed with the Pastrami sando, with minimal melted swiss and thousand island sauce, but it's definitely a large amount of meat.  Service was friendly and quick. Interior is clean with a ton of seating crammed into the small spot, ~30 chairs. Crowd is mostly men from the nearby businesses- if you're a single lady looking for a nice guy with a good job, try stopping in here to pick up more than your lunch! ;)"}
{"text":"Walked in today for lunch to go. I had a 6 inch Italian sub and a small bowl of split pea soup. YUM! The bread was the best, soft yet chewy. They were busy, but luckly I got my order taken quickly, and was ready within 5 minutes to go! Will be making another trip back, wish they were open on the weekends."}
{"text":"This mom and pop sub shop is off Cameron right before Hacienda if you are heading South. I stopped in for lunch a little after 1 and was informed I just missed the rush. I am sure they get a lot of traffic from the surrounding businesses. If you are in a hurry they do take orders over the phone and they also deliver.   Menu items include hot and cold subs, salads, soups and even pasta. The subs come either 6\" or 12\". I got the 6\" meatball which comes with provolone and marinara. I made my meal a combo that comes with a large bag of  chips and a drink. The sandwich although it was only 6\" was very filling. The bread was soft and chewy and the meatballs were tasty. The ladies who were helping me were very nice and you can tell they take pride in this place. This place is not too far from work, so I can definitely see myself coming back here."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the turkey here! Some of the best deli style sandwiches around!!"}
{"text":"Amazing such great food and customer service. They are super nice and prices are great for the quality of food. I highly recommend trying it if you haven't."}
{"text":"Quite disappointing considering the reviews. I called them last Tuesday and ordered 1 1/2 trays of sandwiches and chips to be delivered on Friday @ 11:00 AM for 14 of us at our office training meeting. We thought we would try somewhere different for a change. HMMM. The only positive thing I can say is that the delivery guy arrived right on time as promised. The downfall was that not only did they forget the plates and napkins, they also failed to add ANY condiments on the bread or even provide us with individual packets for use.  The result being DRY sandwiches. Fortunately, one of the employee's had a small container of mayonnaise in the lunchroom fridge which we all of course devoured. Needless to say, we will use our usual place next time."}
{"text":"Great staff and good food at a great price. And I mean great price. The beat is that there is hardly anywhere else to eat, and the staff, they are so awesome."}
{"text":"Great place! Forget Subway. Port of Subs, and Capriotti's-this is a great, local, quaint shop that has made me very happy a couple if times. Subs are great and the salads are huge. Plenty of choice on the menu-I always smell theirs italian meatballs and will make it a point to get next time. It's in a little office plex on Hacienda East of Arville."}
{"text":"I feel like Rachel Ray's evil twin when I talk about this place.  Yuck-O!  This is located by a bunch of office buildings in the industrial part of the city, so I know who they're catering to.  It's quick, it's easy, and I have a feeling that a lot of burly guys workin' fork lifts all day don't have the most delicate of palates.  However, I worked by here for a while and while I did sometimes I got stuck at my desk through lunch hour.  Munch a Sub (we ended up calling it Punch a Pud) was my only hope.   The bread was always ALWAYS soggy.  Their meat tasted like processed food stuffs instead of actual meat.  Veggies were limp, sauces were wrong, things were forgotten.  Munch A Sub should only be utilized in dire episodes of near starvation."}
{"text":"I am a super fan of this joint.  It is a little \"mom and pop\" style shop hidden away in an industrial area.  We often times order from them either over the phone or on the website and pick up lunch for the whole office.  The staff is super friendly and remembers the regulars all the time.    I love the Chicken Cordon Bleu sandwich but have had several other fantastic meals as well."}
{"text":"Ok so the sandwiches are pretty big here. However, the rating is based on the fact that the manager told me two days in advance that they'd deliver the food. I explained my situation and that I needed all food delivered and they confirmed that they could do it (I'm from out of town and was on a film set).  7am on the day of delivery I called to triple check and they told me they decided they wouldn't deliver. My job started at 8am.   Mind you...they were nice and prepared all food in morning but they totally lied to me and gave NO discount. Very nice people but I was infuriated and tried my hardest not going NYC on them.   Sandwiches=great  Coffee= instant coffee at best   I talked to the manager and co workers didn't follow through. BIG disappointment."}
{"text":"I used to love ordering from Munch-a-sub, but their new online system has ruined that. After my order was incorrectly placed by eatstreet, I was told I had to pay again for the sandwich I actually wanted. When my incorrect order arrived it wasn't even correct. They describe their \"Chicken Cordon Blue\" as having chicken, ham, and Swiss cheese, but mine had cheddar. I ordered wheat bread, and I got white."}
{"text":"This food kicks ass, the management is super nice, family owned. I got a massive calzone and drink for less than 9 bucks. I can barely finish it. These guys are real down to earth."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch, I ordered the pastrami and was more than satisfied! Check it out!"}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars!  Was in the area and did a search of places close by to eat for lunch and this place turned up only 1 mile away. This is one of those places that are located in a business type/plaza setting. Parking is adequate and there are just enough tables and chairs inside to seat about 15 people.  What I got was the 12 inch Philly Sub ($9.25). Has roast beef, melted provolone, mushrooms, onions, and special seasoning. I thought it was kind of weird that they used roast beef for the meat when it should be thinly sliced sirloin. In any case it was very good. They really load up on the meat and the bread was def the kind that you would get in Philly.  For a complete meal which includes chips and a drink will come out to 12 bucks and change. Kind of pricey but after eating the sandwich I was so full that I almost didn't eat dinner later on that night.  Some notables. Since they are in this business/plaza type setting they are only open Monday through Friday. On the Yelp listing the hours are 9 am to 4 pm. On their website it says 7 am to 3 pm. Im assuming the website is more correct because they are serving breakfast now. I recommend that you call first if you are bordering on these times.  In closing, this is a pretty good place to eat a nice sized sandwich. Just don't expect to come here for dinner.  Yelp 2015 review #6  505 overall"}
{"text":"I saw the pictures of the sandwiches and thought about it all day at work. So I figured I would head over there for lunch and check it out. They had a corned beef footlong with a large soda for $9.50 as a special of the day. I ordered it and like previously said stated by others, the sandwiches are 12\" and stuffed with meat. Now down to the taste. The corned beef sandwich I had was decent at best. It wasn't as salty as I've had or prefer. But It did make me full. It wasn't bad, I'm just a little picky when it comes to corned beef and pastrami. However the service was outstanding so I will give this sandwich shop another visit to see if I can raise my rating."}
{"text":"My friends shop is around the corner so stopped by for lunch.  Big selection of sandwiches.   I got the meatball sub on their recommendation.  Bread was pretty good but they didn't do anything to it. I like the bread thrown on the flaptop with a little butter.  The meatball themselves were decent with nice texture and flavor but they needed to put enough sauce on it.  They sprinkled a little mozzarella on it.  I wish they put it under the salamander or broiler and a little parmesan would have been nice.  All in all, pretty boring sandwhich but with decent ingredients."}
{"text":"Hidden little gem of a sandwich place! One of my favorite \"locals\" sub shop! The staff is super sweet! Sandwiches are big and delish!  You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Recently moving here to Vegas and not knowing much about my surroundings, I was happy to stumble upon this place right next to my job! (Literally, it takes me less than 45 seconds to get there--lord help me as this place will be the death of me.)   The moment you walk in, you are instantly greeted by beautiful smiles from all the ladies that work there. The shop itself is small, quaint, and actually quite perfect, They offer an array of subs, sandwiches and  salads and prepared with a fantastic attitude!  I ordered a hot Roast Beef sub sans the onions. Served on a soft luscious bread, so soft it makes me want to sleep on it. The roast beef comes in heaping amounts followed by generous servings of mushroom and provolone. I can only assume if ordered with onions you'd get no less of a treatment.   As I take my first bite, the juices from the roast beef come oozing out with an insane amount of italian flavor. The big chucks of mushroom add just the right amount of texture followed by the creaminess of the provolone.   Also the sub doesn't remind me much of New York City--it did satisfy every bit of craving I've been having.  I am definitely booking marking this place as my go-to sandwich shop near my job!"}
{"text":"Do you even munch bro?  Pretty much the only time you'll be around this place is... never. I mean it's tucked away in a industrial area that's directly behind the Delano. I only found the place because I left a meeting starving and Yelped, \"Random Sandwich\". Yelpers know, whenever you Yelp any type of food item and you're near the strip you either get chain locations or a fine dining restaurants where a salad cost $23.  Munch-A-Sub is very underwhelming from the outside, but when you walk-in the bright colors and the \"NY look\" perk up your taste buds. The menu is filled with salads, sammies, and a few pasta dishes. l was a little nervous to order pasta in a place like this so I went with the classic lunch. Pastrami on Wheat.   This thing was a monster, tons of veggies, heavy handed on the pastrami, and just the right amount of mustard. I ordered the twelve-inch sandwich and it was more than enough. If you do happen to head here, I recommend the six-inch, because this was a lot food.   The service here is basic and the food arrived promptly. A few things that bothered me: The bathroom, it's located in the back, through the kitchen, behind the prep table, and once you're in you realize it's also the storage closet. The Price, my sandwich with a bottled water cost $14 w/ tip, dayum. A little too rich for my blood when it comes to deli style sandwiches settings.   Not my first choice, but if you're near the Middle Earth of Las Vegas pop-in and spread some local love."}
{"text":"Really good sandwiches  we had the number 19. I ate half and took the rest on the road on the way back to LA. Worth going off the strip for. The bad thing it closes to early."}
{"text":"Stop here because I need something to eat for lunch. Was originally looking for a subway but didn't see one close but so I look for some sandwich places and there was this place about a block away from me so I went for it.   It was quite yummy I got a Italian sub, I do not remember the exact name of it, to me it was like a great anti-pasta salad but in a sub with some added meat. Plus it came with a couple of cookies, that tasted like it was made at home.  It's a small place, the lady behind the register was helpful and a true doll. They also have some breakfast stuff witch I would have taken advantage if I wasn't in a rush. I do recommend this spot if your looking for a good sub hot or cold."}
{"text":"Oh man this sandwich shop is truely diamond in the rough! It reminds me of a New York sandwich shop.The staff is super sweet, it smells amazing and sandwiches are absolutely delicious!!! Forget subway Munch-a-Sub is the place to go! They have a great selection. Whatever you have a taste for they probably have it. I got the pastrami with mustard and pickles.. Omg! The pastrami is tender and flavorful! No sore jaws from chewing here! And their sub roll is a bread lovers dream lol. I love this little oasis in the desert. I will definitely be recommending this place to everyone I know. You should most come on over and check them out."}
{"text":"Never knew this place existed until I started working for WWG. All the guys I work of go here and they love it!  I've gone a couple of times and every time, the sandwiches are always delicious! The gals that work there are super nice and spunky.  Love all the people that frequent this place too!"}
{"text":"With SO many sandwich/pasta shops in town that all share the same boring menu, I was hesitant to try this place out. I'm so glad I did! Glancing at the menu I noticed they offer tomatoes stuff with various salads. I hate tomatoes and would never order that lol, BUT I was impressed that they offered something different than the other guys.   I ordered the Cobb salad, it was GIANT with no shortage of toppings (THANK YOU)  Judging from the phone call and delivery guy, they seem like nice people on top of it. I will most definitely order here again."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. It filled me up but not w anything memorable. Chili was decent but very salty. Salad was ok. Was expensive for what I got. Friendly service. Near work so may be back if in a pinch.   Seems to be there are many who rate mainly on quantity."}
{"text":"The Italian sub was delicious! I recently moved to the Bay Area and I haven't found a decent sub! I'm here in Vegas for a few weeks and found this gem. The sub was perfectly sized and seasoned with this special sauce that reminded me of the Italian bakery that I used to frequent back in Massachusetts. The meats were sliced super thin as were the veggies. I prefer it this way because each bite is delicate but absorbs the seasoning so well. Service was quick and happy. I'll be back to try the many other options!"}
{"text":"Just started ordering from them, and so far its been the best service, and delicious food !"}
{"text":"Got off work a little early today and decided to take my husband some lunch at his work. I yelped food and came across this place and realized he has talked about it before. So I said what the heck I will try that!! I think I must have showed up right after the lunch rush because it was empty. I was happy though!! I received my two sandwiches faster then the speed of light! Food was awesome and service was great!!! I bought two #58 which is the California sub. Comes on a croissant with turkey bacon avocado mayo and it awesome!! Hopefully I can eat here again when I am down in this area."}
{"text":"This place has the east coast taste that is so rare and difficult to find in Vegas. You can tell it's legit from the moment you walk in and are greeted by the cooks just doing their thing; making proper sandwiches. We ordered the chicken parm sub and a toasted tuna salad sandwich. Both were generous portions and super good value for your dollar. Toasted, meaty, and made with love. They also have a great selection of chips, making this spot an awesome lunch option. Thank goodness for finally seeking a deli/sandwich shop that does it right."}
{"text":"Munch a sub's is a great lil sandwich shop. All of there sub's that I've had taste great. They have a good selection of sandwiches as well as other foods. If your looking for a good sub and good service I recommend it."}
{"text":"Was craving something \"fresh\" on a fine Monday afternoon and came across this place. Ordered the #58 to go- California croissant which came with the most delicious, fatty turkey meat, mayo, avocado, and the crispiest bacon (none of that microwavable nonsense most sub places serve). Got the boyfriend a 12\" hot pastrami w/ lettuce, tomato, and mustard; added yellow peppers and jalapenos.   LOVED my sandwich. Pretty much inhaled it during the car ride. Only complaint my bf had was that he got yellow peppers instead of pepperoncini in his sub.  They have a whole list of soups I'd love to try, and even their salads looked bomb diggity. Tight seating area so taking it to-go would be your best bet!  I will ditch work and return again one of these days."}
{"text":"Their subs were so good. It was nice they open early, so we get pack some delicious subs on our way to Valley of Fire."}
{"text":"This is a great lunch spot Lasagna is good. Sandwiches cold or hot also very good.  Soups never disappoint    I recommend this spot to everyone."}
{"text":"the food is pretty good and fresh and delivery is always quick. I just wish they had more breakfast menu items."}
{"text":"Personally not my type of place but some of my co workers really like it. To me it is like some home made food and sandwiches that doesn't have that pop or flare that I look for. The menu doesn't impress me much either seeing as how I am pretty picky about my food."}
{"text":"For $1 more I was able to get twice the sandwich. It doesn't make sense not to. And since I ordered a sub yesterday for lunch, only ate half, I haven't stopped thinking about it since. Like, woke up this morning craving the other half of the sandwich good.   So for lunch I was looking for a sandwich but I'm generally unimpressed by Port of Subs which is the closest sandwich shop to me. Thanks to Yelp, I spent some time researching the number of sandwich shops within a 5 mile radius. Narrowing it down to two choices, Munch a Sub won, mostly because of the Yelp photos and the name. It's a good name. Oh, and you can pre-order online. Personally I think preordering food is 2016's greatest gift to us.  Anyhoo, I preordered a meat & cheese sub with banana peppers. By the time I got there it was ready. This is great compared to some other lunch places nearby that really do want 30 minutes to make my food. I don't understand how that's helpful, I get like 30 minutes for lunch and I can't waste it waiting on someone to get through a line of people to make my food. Some places just don't understand pre-ordering. So I get to Munch a Sub and I notice it is almost a hole in the wall. People are right, there are probably enough chairs & tables to cater to the die hard, must eat in the place, patrons. I am not one of them.   Apparently they also cater so I think I'll push for their sandwiches & salads in our next group meeting."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about how much I love this place! First of all, the service is fantastic. These ladies are always friendly and accommodating. It's nice to see a familiar smiling face at lunch. Secondly, the food is delicious - and you get A LOT of it. I can never eat an entire sandwich for lunch, so I always have some to take home for dinner. Crab salad sandwich and the #19 (ham, salami, and capicola) are my favorites. For a few extra dollars, you can make it a combo with chips and a drink. While others may give you small sides, this place does not skip out. Large bag of chips and a huge drink. Definitely the most bang for your buck. I remain a devoted sandwich follower of this place!"}
{"text":"Had lunch delivered to my office a few weeks ago since it was only $1.00. I ordered the pastrami sandwich. Was very tasty and they dressed it just they way I wanted. Delivery was very speedy"}
{"text":"Munch A Sub is not just a sub shop anymore! Munch A Sub has breakfast as well.  I work in the area and had gone into Munch A Sub a couple years back for lunch. The sandwich I had then was good, and the guy working was really nice... But Vegas is a city with many options for lunch, so I didn't go back for a while... Actually, I kind of forgot it even existed...   Some of my coworkers started getting lunch delivered by Munch A Sub, and they left a menu in the break area. I noticed that the selection of food offered had dramatically increased since I had eaten there, so I saved the menu...  From time to time my boss likes to treat his staff with breakfast, and therefore we are always on the lookout for a new place to try. I remembered Munch A Sub had expanded their menu so we decided to get breakfast sandwiches from them. The sandwiches come on either an english muffin or a croissant (higher price for the later), choice of breakfast meat, and cheese.   Damn these are some good breakfast sandwiches! I split one with a coworker because the croissants are on the large size, and I am trying to watch my figure. It was still plenty of food for both of us... And according to my boss, it's the best breakfast sandwich he has ever had!   If you are in the area and want to support a local business, give Munch A Sub a try!"}
{"text":"To quote others..., Munch-A-Sub IS the best sandwich place in town. Their motto is \"the best kept secret in town\" and I understand why. They're located in a convenient but out-a-the-way small business district that you could drive by for years without noticing. They're also only open for the local business crowd but believe me, it's worth searching them out.   They are the antithesis of the crappy corporate sandwich chains.  Yes... Some chains bake their own bread, but not like this. This is real home made bread. It has flavor, it had body, it has a great chewy crust.  These people know what a great sandwich should consist of.   They do all the usuals, only better than you've ever had em before, and they do others like Italian sausage or meat ball mix, and the best meatloaf sandwich that equals my own mothers. They make a calzone that's pretty incredible. Their French dip with au jus.... Heck, they're all good.  You can not make the best sandwich with ordinary ingredients or ordinary bread. These people have it down.... No wonder they want to keep it a secret.   Best of all, no chain environment. These are people you can talk to.  Not assembly line sandwich zombies."}
{"text":"Food is fresh.I'd compare it to Jimmy Johns but way more pricier.I paid 15$ for a California sandwich,water bottle & bag of chips.Not worth the prices if you ask me.Seems like organic prices"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great service, Great sandwich... it's a must on your next luncheon!!! I had the Club sandwich and the bread, meat, topping, all fresh and the presentation was on point! Loved it!!"}
{"text":"nice place! compact place, biiig subs, I ordered the full size pastrami, chips and soda for $14.  not cheap, but you get what you pay for in this place - pay a little more for quality, right?  If I can remember to, I'll stop into this place again for their hot dishes - they close early since they're in an industrial area - so be sure to get in for lunch!"}
{"text":"I am currently eating their philly steak sandwich. It's bomb. Huge portion and the meat, cheese, and seasoning kills it. This is my second trip but I now know I'll certainly be coming back for more after this reaffirmation. The service was exceptionally friendly and the ordering process was easy.  Enjoy every sandwich. -  Warren Zevon"}
{"text":"Love Munch A Sub! I forgot about it for a while and when I found it again I was so happy! The turkey bacon avocado is where its at!"}
{"text":"I have bee. In Vegas for over 10 years. I moved from the DC area and have looked high and low for a good sandwich spot. I found it..."}
{"text":"Great subs. I had the NY Special, they made it really fast, and it was delicious. Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"What a great sub especially the Italian I think the best in town only bad thing about this place is that I don't live closer and great customer service"}
{"text":"I was waiting for my husband to get tattooed and this happened to be next door. The service was awesome, the food came out quick, and it was really tasty! I would go again!"}
{"text":"Huge subs! I mean HUGE! I got the Philly hot sub. Instead of sautéed yellow onion they put fresh red onion slivers. I prefer grilled/sautéed onions on my cheesesteak subs. Oh well. Lots of tender beef and sautéed mushrooms and the bread was fluffy. Pretty pricey though for a sandwich. $8.50 for a 6 inch sub? Makes Subways $5 foot longs sound like an amazing deal. Lol.   I also got the Italian Wedding soup and that was my favorite part of the meal. The soup was filled with pasta and meatballs and had a great flavor. I'd definitely recommend their soups or at least the Italian Wedding soup."}
{"text":"Good food... BBQ Pork Sandwich - Best Ever!    Philly Cheese Steak Sub - yummy!      Deli Sub with Turkey and Capicola - superb deli meats and fantastic bread! There is only 1 item that I would not recommend - egg salad stuffed tomato. It did not live up to expectations. But everything else I've had has been delicious."}
{"text":"Hot or cold subs and breakfast! What more could you want out of your sub shop. I ordered a philly and at first was put off because it wasn't a traditional style of meat on the sandwich. However the beef was plentiful and the sandwich was delicious. Also I've never had Tostitos salsa verde chips in snack size so those being available was just wonderful! Love this place officially, anytime I'm down in this neighborhood I'll be back."}
{"text":"I met a friend that works nearby at Munch-A-Sub for lunch.  Friendly counter service and food quality was very good, with freshest bread and generous portions.  I have a feeling if you wanted something special they would accommodate your cravings, providing they had the ingredients. Many thanks to my friend Ray for the invite and turning me on to a classic sub shop that offers so much more! I ordered through yelp using Eat24"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! It's a hidden gem in an industrial park! Everything coming out looked amazing! My husband ordered the Italian which is absolutely delicious and I ordered a chicken cordon bleu and was surprised with cheddar cheese instead of Swiss and it was amazing! Their bread is fresh and fluffy! We've been looking for our go to sub shop in Vegas and so far nothing has compared to the quality of service or food that we've received here! Stoked that it's literally 5 mins from our apartment!"}
{"text":"I ordered food through yelp at this place and I must say that their service was awesome. I requested a 12\" sub in a sour dough and Stepahnie called me very quick to let me know the consequences of having my sub in a sour dough since I added a bunch of things to it, so I changed the bread to the white sub. The sandwich was awesome and it was just as I expected it except that it was a 6\" sub, for which I called back and they explained that when I made the bread switch it reset back to a standard 6\", but Stephanie didn't hesitate to send the other half within minutes of the initial delivery, which was an awesome gesture of hers. The delivery arrived sooner than expected so I'm very pleased fort that as well. The reason I'm giving a 4 start eating is due to the food itself. Although it has an awesome presentation the taste is very ordinary, good enough to calm one's  hunger but nothing out of this world; the potato salad however was a bit old, the potatoes were rubbery and tasted weird, not spoiled just funny due to the age I suppose. Price is good as well, can't complain for that, I would just suggest putting more flavor to the food. Will definitely come back due to the awesome service, but will stick to the subs only."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here looking for a great deli that would fill us up with a big sandwich. Boy did we find it. The staff was super friendly and nice and knowledgeable and help us with our right choice of sandwich we were looking for. We will definitely return and suggest this to anyone looking for a mom-and-pop's deli."}
{"text":"Little mom & pop shop in an industrial part of town. They're very liberal with their meats which you can't beat in my opinion. Pretty much the reason I never go to Subway because I feel like I get jipped with only two turkey slices on my sandwhich, but I digress. I got the chicken salad on a sub roll. Delicious chicken salad. Literally THE BEST chicken salad I have had in my life. The bread wasn't that great, but I'm partial to wheat. It was also soggy, but I waited a good 20 minutes to eat it. Next time I'm definitely just gonna grab a seat and eat there to avoid the soggy bread. I'm telling you though I grabbed a fork and just ate the chicken salad right off the bread. It's a little pricier than your standard sub chain, but keep in mind their gonna give you a heaping helping of meat. You can tell that the owners really care about their business and customers too. Very polite speedy service. If you're looking for a $5 foot long this isn't your place, but if you want to support local business and get a yummy lunch look no further!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  I happened to be in the area for training,  and I was lucky to find this place.  Sandwiches are amazing (great bread), and food comes out quickly.   Liked it so much I came back for breakfast.   Fingers crossed."}
{"text":"Total hole-in-the-wall that happens to have the best subs in town. Seriously. If you are accustomed to East coast style subs that are filled with quality ingredients on great bread... This is your place. Where the other sub shops (looking at you Capri...) have a lot of bread and not much inside... This place piles it on.   My favorite by far is the Roast Beef #29. Their marinated mushrooms they put on it are unbelievable.   Really cool family ownership. Just wish I didn't have to drive in the middle of an industrial park I don't work in to get it."}
{"text":"Expensive, but good, mostly. I was really bummed that they used canned mushrooms on my sandwich, really ruined it for me. The wife liked the CA croissant sandwich she had and the kids enjoyed their roast beef but I think it was overpriced and the canned mushrooms killed it."}
{"text":"There's no way I would've found this place without yelp.  Listen to the other reviewers.  This is in the middle of nowhere surrounded by businesses you don't typically go to, but the sandwiches are really really good.  A tad bit expensive, but worth it in my opinion.  My favorite is the 4b (I get the large, so it's $10 instead of $9.25 for a regular with a drink).  It's a meatball sub with marinara and bacon.  I also got a breakfast burrito here once (their salsa was great in it), and I couldn't eat the rest of the day.    One warning: there is a $1 surcharge for credit/debit cards."}
{"text":"Ordered a \"make your own \" turkey sandwich and chips for delivery to my hotel...super fast, less than 20 minutes.  Sandwich was just as ordered and had a ton of turkey!"}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Philly\" Sub.  They used canned mushrooms in it.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"THE BEST FOOD I HAVE EVER HAD FOR LUNCH! I just moved here for work and I have not had a \"home-cooked\" meal in months. This was the closest I have come to my family's cooking. WOW! loved it.   I ordered at the counter and had my food within minutes. Everyone is genuine and humble and they will serve you an extra side of kindness that makes the world go round."}
{"text":"Munch a Sub makes me want to munch on a sub.  What I am honestly a fan of is their breakfast menu. They offer good food at reasonable rates. The English muffin sausage with cheese is huge and the sausage is King of that meal.   Whether you want to walk in or have delivery this place is a must. It is good, fresh and tasty food.  You can't go wrong with their roast beef sandwich, one of my favorites. You can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches. They have like 30 options to chose from when it comes to their lunch menu.  Want something local with a lots of flavor? Then this is must do for you."}
{"text":"This is one of the best philly subs I've ever had. The bread was so fresh! They said they get it from a local bakery every morning. Nice staff. If you like the feel of mom & pop restaurants, this is your place."}
{"text":"Love the ladies at Munch-A-Sub! They are always friendly, efficient and once in awhile, throw in a delicious homemade cookie with my sandwich.  Try the BLT and the Chicken Salad on toasted wheat...you won't be disappointed!"}
