{"text":"Despite all of the new multi-story buildings going up in the area, the Entertainment district is still full of lively, exciting, cool and truly unique places to check out; from the theatres to the restaurants, it is a great area to spend a night or two and explore.  I hesitate to say I \"stumbled\" upon this particular location as it is quite visible across from the main strip of theatres on this part of King Street, but I did enter on quite the spontaneous whim.  Their contemporary and inviting atmosphere is infused with Motown and Blues décor and music, which sets the mood perfectly for their southern dishes.  They offer up a nicely balanced menu of traditional Cajun-style grub and the more typical Canadian restaurant fare; from fish and fried foods galore, to goat-cheese-adorned salads and honey-garlic chicken, there really is something for everyone.  I popped in early and was greeted with the notice of half-priced appetizers before 8:00 p.m. - a great opportunity to try a couple.  There are plenty of barbecued chicken, rib and steak platters to choose from, but what could be more appropriate than their cornmeal crusted catfish sticks?  I had them with the goat cheese and Cajun-roasted pistachio salad, and it turned out to be a delightful meal.  The catfish sticks are a must. After I ordered, a small plate with one tiny morsel of something arrived in front of me - this was worrisome.  Thankfully, it was just a mini-muffin sized, mildly sweet portion of cornbread (a side note: not enough restaurants give you complimentary bread at the table anymore; it does not have to be an overflowing basket of buns, but just a small bite of something light and delicious starts the meal off right). When the fish did arrive, I was more than impressed with the serving size. They were light and crispy and with smokey-sweet Cajun spice and served a tangy tartar sauce.  The salad had a hint of that same Cajun spice on the pistachios, but was otherwise just as expected for greens, except for one crucial detail - the copious amount of cheese!  Finally, a restaurant after my own dairy-loving heart!  I have too often overpaid for goat-cheese-promising pastas and salads that have fallen short.  Joe Mamas, on the other hand, gave me a meal-size salad, with more than my fair share of cheese, and all at half-price no less!  I eased myself into my first southern cuisine experience with a dinner of appetizers, worried that I might be confronted with an over-spiced and over-fried spread.  Thankfully proven wrong, on my next visit to Joe Mamas, I'll be diving into their menu with less hesitancy."}
{"text":"I went to Joe Mamas on Sunday night, the place had very good ambiance and an excellent band.  When it came to the food, I must say it was a horrible experience. Who puts mustard and hot spices with Ravioli? The wine selection was also pretty dismal, we ended up giving away the $60 bottle to the couple beside us.  If I may say, they need to also improve the dressing of their wait staff. The bartenderess was wearing a tight shirt with her belly hanging out. Gosh, not the service that I expect after spending a small fortune."}
{"text":"The food is not good, I tried the steak and shrimps and my husband ate ribs and there was no flavor at all, for that price, I expected better food.  Also the service is bad, I asked for a glass of water and the waitress completly ignored me."}
{"text":"This is a neat jazz bar to have friends celebrate a birthday party. There was a good live band playing the night I went and the place was crowded like a can of sardines, the more the merrier here! Their signature corn bread is awesome but I can't say so much for the main dishes. The fried calamaris were the worst I've ever had, at least the home green salad was fine although I made a bad choice of drinking it with Zinfandel. The prices are reasonable considering you get to watch or dance to a live show; for 2 glasses of wine and the above cost $35 excluding tip."}
{"text":"A saturday night must! Stopped in randomly with some girl friends because we heard the music. They had a band playing called \"sugar\".  We had a few snacks at the bar, the 3 type rib platter and avocado bruschetta, which were amazing, if we hadn't eaten dinner before coming here were would have tried more stuff on the menu.  There's always next time and there will definitely be a next time.  The front of house staff was lovely, and good looking ;)  The bartenders that night were very busy, but not busy enough to smile and make us \"girly shots\". They do have a cover, it's 10 $ but who doesn't on a saturday night? well worth it."}
{"text":"The food, service and ambience were great! We went on a Friday night, without reservations and though the place was packed, the hostess was nice enough to accomodate us. Fun. lively atmosphere with a nice band playing. Food was delicious - based on some of the previous reviews, we ordered the catfish sticks and ribs which were excellent. I also had the soup with lobster and shrimps covered in philo pastry - it was delicious. Overall, fun place with a good vibe and great food. Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"excellent music great look..the food not so great . the waitress took way too long to serve and had an attitude collecting the food.  Didn't even ask if we liked the food. my friend ordered a chicken gumbo and the chef forgot the chicken."}
{"text":"We came here for our one one and only summerlicious dinner and it was great. There were 9 of us so it was a semi large group. I had the goat cheese and pistachio salad which was so good and it was a very large portion. My co-workers had the pulled pork which they said they enjoyed. Everyone had ribs has their main course and we all had different sauces. I had the Carolina sauce which had a bit of kick and my ribs were very saucy exactly how I liked them. The ribs were a bit on the small side but they were cooked to perfection. The Jack Daniel's sauce and the house sauce were also good...just not quite as good as the Carolina. We all had a chocolate mousse cake for desert which was also very yummy.  The ambience here was very cool and they had a live singer during our meal. He was amazing and took requests. They had Delerium on tap which also made me happy since it's one of my favourites. Overall, an excellent dinner and atmosphere.  My only complaint was that it took our server 40 minutes to get our cheques but I'm going to chalk that up to the fact that she had initially put it all on one bill and then we asked her to split it all out at the last minute.  I'm definitely coming back here for all you can eat ribs. Great find."}
{"text":"I went out to Joe Mamas with my Ultimate Frisbee team last night. This was the first time I had been to this joint. I have avoided (rightly or wrongly) this stretch of King st. However, Joe Mamas has made me curious to explore some of the other restaurants on this strip, even if they are touristy.   Joe Mamas is a pretty cool place. Bathed in red and having a really cool in house blues band gives it a hip vibe that is good for drinks or casual dinner with friends. The food is primarily 'continental' with a southern/creole spin. Instead of white bread, the servers bring warm cornbread muffins and you can order dishes like cornmeal crusted catfish, which is exactly what I did.   The cornmeal crusted catfish is a nice take on the battered and fried white fish (aka fish and chips). I wouldn't say that this dish would be near the top of my fish and chips list. But it is definitely a nice dish and the cornmeal batter is different from the typical flour batter. There is a nice crispness to the cornmeal and the catfish stays nice and moist.  Cornmeal is certainly not a light airy batter, but it manages not to be overly heavy. I got the seasonal vegetables and mashed potatoes for my 2 sides. These were pretty good. Although, something makes me think that the seasonal vegetables don't change with the season given that they were peppers, broccoli, beans.   All and all I would say that this is a decent restaurant. The food is alright and the service was pretty good. But what really makes this place worth checking out is the band and the overall vibe of the restaurant. We were there on a Wednesday night at about about 8pm and there was a pretty good crowd."}
{"text":"Visited Mr.Joe Mama's on a Saturday night with a few friends for dinner/drinks. It's a small, trendy lounge right in the heart of the city. The crowd is a great mix of people, 25-35 age group and what a great atmosphere!   We arrived at about 8:30pm in time for dinner and the place was already packing it in, so I'm glad we had made a reservation. The waitress was a little hard to find at times but I chopped that up to short staff. I ordered the seafood pasta and although it wasn't the best I've ever had, it was pleasantly good! Next time if we go for dinner I'd be sure to arrive a bit earlier to enjoy the place being well lit and quiet enough for conversation flow during dinner. Reason for that is because around 9:30pm they have a live band that takes the floor and by then the lights go down, music goes up (a tad \"TOO\" up) and there isn't an empty table in the house! The band was called \"Suga\" and they were absolutely amazing!! Playing R&B classics all night long.  We didn't aim to stay all night but enjoyed ourselves so much that we ended up shutting the place down - a winner:)"}
{"text":"Very rude hostess!!! Food is OK. We went back to celebrate our anniversary and the hostess was so rude, impatient and not friendly at all! We never go back! That's not the way to treat returning customers who booked a table 3 weeks in advance! You lost a customer! McDonald's treat the customers better!"}
{"text":"If you are here at night for a live band and you are 3 people or less then sit at the bar, just to the left of the beer fountain or more and you will have a class A seating.  Miraculous place. Wonderful drinks, friendly staff and great performers. I tried to eat here once while the band is playing and it was too much for me. But as a night fun, it's 5/5."}
{"text":"Ribs were great... Great service(Ashley was awesome). We were pleased, and band came on at perfect time. We'll return for sure.try the etoffe (shrimp,  lobster) delish and arrived hot.  Marco outside makes it seem too touristy... Don't be fooled.. C'mon in!!!"}
{"text":"I checked this place out as part of their Winterlicious promotion. Their Winterlicious menu really appealed to me and so I decided to check them out. The customer service was really good, but the only complaint is that it took a while to arrive (usually wouldn't not be an issue, but there were only like 5 other customers there). Aside from the wait, the food was amazing! I got the pulled pork plate and it was so good! For the main, I got the JD Bourbon Ribs and they were great as well. I'd definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Just went in for a drink and some appetizers. Had the Wibs and Fried Shrimp. All very tasty, albeit a tad pricey for the portion size. However, judging from the fantastic taste, I'll definitely want to head back for a regular dinner."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in this place. If I could give minus a few stars I would!  We heard they were having a live band so we go in to check it out. When you walk in to the right are tables and the bar area to the left very small. We were told we couldn't sit at any table because it was only for dinner. It is 11pm not too sure who's having dinner that late. The waitress that explained it was extremely rude about it! We were told we had to stand in the bar area. Well it was so packed it was no room. Because of the rude worker & no room to stand we decided to leave.   This is were I have the big issue. The rude worker follows us out and proceeds to yell at us asking why we yelled at her. My friend exchanged words with her. We didn't yell anything at her. But all I kept thinking was it was a so called manager right by the door. He did absolutely nothing! What a horrible place that allows their employees to harass customers who have no where to sit or stand & decide to leave.   I guarantee I will never return and tell everyone I know how horrible we were treated."}
{"text":"location   In restuarant row - theatre district.    format ..  essentially this place has 2 options   1 - sit down dinner to the left   2- bar and stand up area to the left . it gets very crowded later at night  and if you dont mind standing up and listening to live music..then this is the place for you   To the rear their is a stage which is visible  to both restuarant and bar  with an adjacent dance floor which is the most compact I have ever seen .  again they do pack em in to that tiny dance floor   Music   Monday: 7:30pm - 11:30pm Tuesday: 8:00pm- 12:00am Wednesday: 8:00pm- 12:00am Thursday: 8:30pm - 12:30am Friday and Saturday: 9:30pm - 1:30am  Sunday: 6:30pm- 10:30pm  I''ve had just about everthing on the menu from goat cheese to  chicken and ribs ..the prices range from $9 to $23 for mains  its a bargain .   the food is fantastic ....  However the best part is the vibe - live jazz - funk   This is not a place for rowdy teens ..yes there is an abundace of  boobs , botox and bacardi   I love it .."}
{"text":"The vibe here was great! Loved the live music it really set the tone. The food was good but a little pricy. But I would like to go back and order whatever I want."}
{"text":"We came here for a work Christmas Party (60+ people) on a Friday night. The party including dinner and an evening of drinks, mingling, listening to live music, and a bit of dancing.  My initial impression when I walked into this place that it was going to be cramped but that quickly changed, and instead I would say it was cozy.   The food was decent, but certainly nothing special and not worth the premium they ask for it. I had the opportunity to sample:   Guacamole Bruschetta - Big portion, tasty enough, a bit different than your usual bruschetta  Grilled Tiger Shrimp Salad - Not bad, but nothing outstanding  Steak and Shrimp - Pretty tasty, though there was no wow factor  Cajun Mixed Grill - The steak was not juicy though it was ordered 'blue rare' which seemed a bit odd, and both the chicken and ribs tasted just like meat brushed with sauce you could buy from the grocery store.    After 9pm the place turns 21+ only, but the crowd is older than that (30's and 40's). The band playing had a real R&B vibe to them and were quite good. There were a few people dancing (the dance floor is very tiny).  There was a very friendly blond server taking care of our group who did an excellent job of making sure everyone had what they needed. Considering they're a small venue they did a pretty great job of taking care of our party of 60+. Thumbs up for that.  My personal recommendation for this place would be to go ahead and check it out if you're in the area already and looking for drinks and live music, but skip eating dinner here. My impression was that this place would be best suited to going out with a small group or just a date."}
{"text":"Disclaimer - I haven't eaten here yet!  Apparently Joe Mama's has a decent steak, but - for totally valid reasons that I will explain in detail below - I've only dipped into this spot after the kitchen is closed.  So... what's the scenario?    It's nearing midnight.  It's Thursday (or Friday, or Saturday).  You're with a lady friend (or a manly friend). You're not quite sure where to take your date next, but your m.o. is to impress and elevate this night to the next level.  Your answer: Joe Mamas.  Snug tight in Restaurant Row on King St. (just west of John), Joe Mamas' evening entertainment is, bar none, the most consistent and top ranking in the T Dot.  The house band (Shugga) consists of 10 players who are constantly rotating, so on any given night, you'll catch 5 of them jamming out for you and yours.  The players are stupid tight and they love what they do.  In fact, you can often catch them winking a little kudos to each other when a band member steps up their game with an unexpected little something special, to break the crowd off right.  Improv + Talent = 1 happy G.  The band has two rotating vocalists who are both superb, but if you get the white boy (don't front, he looks like a fit version of Drew Carey) you're in for quite a night!  Belting out soulful pop classics by Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Marvin Gaye and some hot contemporaries like JT, this dude is ON POINT.  I couldn't find any YouTube clips that do the night justice, so you'll have to trust me on this one.  The downside is as such.  The decor isn't all that fresh and I wouldn't write home about the wine selections or beverage options.  The standing area is really tight and bar service isn't the best.  I'd suggest grabbing a table as the waitresses get around (almost too) quick.  Joe Mamas is the perfect spot to have a few drinks, enjoy some incredible music, indulge in some playful conversation (in between sets) and be on your way.  It kills me to make this place sound like a strip club, but the space and service lead me to believe that you're there for the entertainment, not the food.  If you keep your visit short, sweet and well-timed, you'll consistently have an amazing night, and your date will likely end after breakfast - zing! ;)"}
{"text":"Went there last night. The best hang out place, with bar, dance and live r&b music. Staff was great and the musicians were great. A good time."}
{"text":"Food was ok , service was  lacklaster and it wasnt even busy. I even gave 3 stars because it was summerlicious and I was full after. But  hey at least I can say Ive  been to Joe Mamas after all these years of wanting to go . I think if they revamp the decor it was a little blah , orange and red walls are not a good match nor easy on the eyes. It made the place  dim and not in a romantic way. Seating was horrible anytime you have to adjust the table to fit into your seat , while trying not to bump into the person behind you is never a good sign. Its way better then Harlem thats what I'll say that place is terrible . Maybe Im a little biased because Ive had  impecciable soul food in New York , Detroit  & D.C but Toronto you have to do better. I guess the quest for great soul food continues I mean we have every other cuisine imagineable why not that."}
{"text":"I love joe mamas. They are a funky little spot on king west. They have great martini deals on special for 5 dollars for two oz of alcohol. On most nights they have a live band playing mellow music making it a very nice environment. Only thing is since it's a small place the music is quite loud making it hard to have a conversation. It's perfect for a night out. Super easy to get to via king streetcar so it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"No longer impressed by their guacamole bruschetta which used to be the best in the City. Now it's a 3 piece, semi soggy $12 mess.  The waitress was kind enough to offer a new batch but we didn't have the stomach to bother. The Chardonnay seemed watered down and the calamari, although fried, seemed grilled. Service was slow and we constantly had to flag down the waitressing staff for service! The music is fine however the acoustics aren't the best, making it very difficult to have any sort of conversation without having to yell to the person sitting next to you. Perhaps the demands of TIFF 2015 have made Joe Mamas cut various corners, or the chef has changed. Whatever it is, go for the loud music or because you're a poser, not the overpriced, low end food."}
{"text":"Absolutely hate this place.... Be warned if you go there with a teambuy deal... They give you a menu that's 25% more expensive than the regular menu and also has less selection....  Ended up paying the same amount that I would have paid if I wouldn't have had a teambuy deal... Food was mediocre at best and service is pretty horrible too! The ribs tasted like the PC brand ribs you can buy at loblaws.... and the portions are really small as well for the price...   This place is a total rip off, stay away!!!!"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for live music this is the place to go. Food ok, nice atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"Great music venue and appies place.  IT has everything you want on a casual girls night out.  Are you tired of the bar scene?  Don't want to go to another pub?  And want to dance but don't want to have to resort to going to an entertainment district club?  Go to Joe Mamas!  I've been here a few times and have loved it everytime.  The vibe is casual, the bar is full, the drinks are affordable and the food is souther/filling/fried and delicious.  And they have live music too where some people end up on a small, and slightly awkward the dance floor after 10pm.  The resto is split into two with half sit-down for food and half bar with an obvious pickup vibe.  The crowd is friendly and its a nice place to end up on a weekend when you don't want to have to think too hard about having a good time with a small group of friends."}
{"text":"It's located on restaurant row on King St West.  We visited for a few drinks and a snack at a fairly quiet time in the late afternoon.  The service wasn't the greatest but the server seemed like he was in charge of serving all on his own.  The mixed drinks seemed a bit watered down (we ordered martinis) and the appetizer platter we ordered was quite a small serving given the $30 price tag.  As it got later, they had live music which was ok but we kind of felt sorry for the guy as nobody seemed to be paying attention at all.  They sometimes have food/drinks specials although I can't see myself frequenting this venue."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Given that it us in the most touristy part of The City it's a place worth checking out.  If your not ordering food you have to sit at the bar which is first come first served seating.  We ordered appetizers to be able to have a table near the band.  Calamari came grilled with a spicy rub and was not too chewy.  Complimentary cornbread was very nice--savory with a slight touch of sweetness.  Band performing were excellent.  The guitarist  stood out nice solo on Word Up! Riffs sounded similar to Eddie Hazel.  Tables emptied out around 11pm but by midnight they were pretty packed again.  Nice mix of crowd.  Service was perfectly fine given that they were busy."}
{"text":"The food in general is ok, i felt the price is bit over for the quality. There is a cover charge to get in ($5). The ambiance is very nice live music and very friendly staff. Cocktails are close to $10 a pop we had catfish with lobster; butter shrimps; and mixed grill ($90 with tax). I probably won't get the seafood again but the ribs are to die for! Very tender with just enough source! hmmm"}
{"text":"A great find on King West! We have been in twice now and this restaurant has yet to disappoint. We had steaks that were sizzling and perfectly cooked.  This place makes mashed potatoes taste unbelievably good.  The drinks were interesting and unique.  Service was very good. We left before the music started, but we plan to go back this summer."}
{"text":"Great location for music and drinks.  I went with a large party, therefore I expected the service to be slow.  This was painfully slow!  It was a set menu and took 2.5 hours for our mains to come out.  The starter was good but the main wasn't worth eating.  My ribs were good, my chicken was tastless and my steak burnt.  I returned the steak just to get another cut which was mostly grizzle.  So turned off by my dinner for didn't bother with dessert.  I did see it, looked like a supermarket cake. Stick to music and booze!"}
{"text":"(Good) music every night of the week. love the band on wed/thurs, playing jazz/blues/funk. Half price appetizers before 8pm every night is great. The Guacamole Bruschetta is great (and only $5!).  Show up just before 8pm, order your half price apps. You'll have more than enough time to eat and have a full conversation before the band goes on at around 8:45. They play about a 50 minute set. Not too loud either, but loud enough that you don't hear random chatter.  -1 star because the bartender wouldn't split our bill. \"Sorry, I already entered it!\" well than.. re-enter it? I don't accept the excuse of blaming \"our system\". We live in the computer age, keep up (especially if you're on KING street).  And they don't accept debit!!! (credit is fine though)"}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and music.  Amazing Jazz music on Tuesday.  Most concerts I have paid for weren't good as the music at this place.  The service was great they set you up with food and drinks and we asked to be left alone and they did!  Lots of parking around at TIFF or at the hotel across the way for $6!  If it wasn't a work night we would have stayed longer.  What a find.  A Toronto gem!"}
{"text":"I've been to Joe Mama's countless times, the food is incredible, the vibes were great, music is excellent. However, this will be the last and final time i support this establishment after my encounter.   Went in for a girls night out, got a seat pretty quickly considering how busy they were. Our waiter seemed off, like he didn't want to be working. i work in the industry so i know how it could be sometimes so i just allowed it. However, seeing him interact with other tables with a lot more...happiness...irked me. My girlfriend asked him if he was having a bad day and he said he wasn't, then took our order.  My girlfriends coke was extremely watered down, he told us that they serve 'watered down coke', when she told him she didn't want it anymore he snickered and walked away. I almost lost my cool, as soon as he returned we asked for another waiter and he went on a rant about how he is the manager and blah blah blah, at that point we really wanted to leave but we were hungry, the wait at other restaurants on King street were way to long so we stuck it out, new waiter and all.   THIS is where i got upset. I got the BBQ chicken with a side of collard greens. NOWHERE on the menu does it say that there is PORK in the collard greens. I'm not a fan of pork so as soon as i realized there was some meat in my collard greens i asked our new waitress who told me, \"yes, there is pork inside\". I asked her why it doesn't say it on the menu and she responded in the most ignorant and rudest way \"well, you didn't tell me you don't eat pork\".....I wanted to grab the mic and start throwing out expletives but i didn't, thank God.  I told her there would be no reason for me to tell her i don't eat Pork considering nothing I ordered states it has pork in it....from what I'm aware BBQ chicken is just chicken and collard greens are collard greens....not collard greens +pork.   OVERALL, never going back...food is so good but the service i received was just downright horrible."}
{"text":"Possibly my favorite Toronto hang- beautiful decor and ambiance, a delectable and diverse menu, with incredible live jazz and blues every single night!  There aren't many better places to take a date or just hang with some friends!  They even have half price appetizers at the bar before 8pm!"}
{"text":"An unequivocal five stars!  A bunch of us organized a surprise going away party for a friend of ours and we had a very enjoyable experience.  The restaurant staff were super accommodating of our situation, despite the fact that many of our guests did not show up on time for the reservation.    Our server was extremely helpful and made great suggestions.  The food was absolutely delicious.  The guacamole bruschetta and the spiced chicken skewers were unbelievably good (especially the latter).  The mains also received rave reviews.  My catch of the day (spiced tliapia) which came with two sides totally hit the spot, and the ribs that some of the other guests had also received high praise.  When it came to settle up, we were informed that it would be on one bill, which was no big deal and I took the responsibility of informing everyone what they owed and collecting the funds.  Somehow the credit card charges on two cards that were used for payment (in addition to the cash) were mixed up, but our server was very gracious about reversing the charges.  Another point of note is that the automatic gratuity for our party was only 15% (as opposed to other places that automatically charge you 20%), and we of course bumped that up because of our outstanding service.  Overall, the experience at Joe Mamas was uniformly positive and I look forward to going back again."}
{"text":"I went here last week as I had a Travelzoo coupon.  I have been to this place a few times before..but not recently.  I remember it being much better than what it is now.  I remember the last time I had this scrumptious dill lobster pasta dish...my mouth just waters thinking about it!  This time I didn't really find anything on the menu that I wanted to really really try..i settled on the gnocchi, but alas was told they had sold out the day before.  I tried some other pasta dish filled with goat cheese...it was ok...nothing particularly special.  Wasn't too impressed.  They have bands playing and on this particular night the band was ok too.  From past times I remember the band (the singer was a blond guy) and they were amazing!  Oh well...looks like things have changed....I don't think I would come back here.  Too loud to have a conversation and uninteresting food and overpriced and yucky drinks."}
{"text":"Since I haven't written one of my fun Yelp reviews lately, here I am!  Returning with a ton of new places to yelp about, here is my latest discovery on the King Street strip of restos near my apartment... JOE MAMAS!  During TIFF, I was thinking about restaurants I have not experienced or ate at near my apartment.  Living behind the long strip of restos on King Street, in between John Street and Peter Street, we came across Joe Mamas and had an amazing meal there! And it definitely did not lack in romance in terms of its atmosphere for any people look for a fun date spot!  Joe Mamas is a warm feeling restaurant with the sounds of jazz and R&B music in the background - creating a sexy and sultry feeling right when you walk in. The dark red and deep wooden interior also makes you feel all romanced.  For dinner, I ordered the Surf and Turf Fettucini, which was packed with juicy pieces of chicken breast and HUGE tiger shrimps - all topped off with white wine alfredo sauce and a small amount of parmesan cheese. This lovely meal was $23, but it was a HUGE portion and did not skimp on the shrimp.  My friend ordered the classic Honey Garlic chicken, smothered in the tasty honey garlic sauce and cooked to perfection. She paired her chicken with seasoned veggies and some wild rice - all for $20.  For dessert, we split the \"melt in your mouth\" (as I would call it) RED VELVET CAKE! This cake was absolutely to die for! I am being serious!  After our meal, dessert and coffees came to an end, our bill came to around $55, which is more expensive than usual but well worth it!  I would definitely recommend Joe Mamas as a food spot, a key date spot, a resto stop if you are catching a movie at the Bell Lightbox later in the night (it is right across the street from it) or if you are looking for food with that great Southern taste!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Joe mama's is always really nice, their live bands play  alot of great old school R&B songs. It's a good place to go for drinks abd some live music especially on weekends!   I don't recommend the food, the theme is very New Orleans/ Creole style but I don't think it's that great."}
{"text":"The four of us came for dinner on a Thursday night.  We were seated immediately.  The place was fairly busy.  There was a live band playing jazz.  The music was great but very loud.  It was impossible to talk without yelling. The food was underwhelming at best.  The ribs and the calamari were dry and flavourless.  Definitely worth a visit for the drinks and the music.  However, my advise is to have dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm somewhat surprised by the prevalence of four stars granted to this place, but, hey, to each his own.  Reading more into it, I gather I missed out on the music scene here, which may have affected my grading. From what I did experience, they serve up a lot of meat, ranging from bland to quite good. I know this, having been here only once, because we ordered the (fully-loaded) meat platter, which fed us for days. The only item that really stood out was the ribs. You can pass on the others."}
{"text":"Came for dinner and had a great time.   It was very busy and we had to wait for about 15 mins for a table - but that was better than any other restaurant on Queen street that night!   We all decided to do the 45$ set menu - great idea, bc with too many choices, I can never figure out what to have...  I ordered the pistachio and goat cheese salad to start and the jerk chicken alfredo - dessert I can't actually remember, but I'm sure it was delicious!   The chicken was just the right amount of jerk and the Alfredo was perfect! Portions were huge tho, so I ended up taking some home with me :)"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner for a friend's going away. Decor was nice. Very chilled vibe. There was a live music which was pretty good. That was the best part. It goes downhill from there. I found service was slow. There was one guy servicing the place it seems and he was running all over the place. Ordered Jerk Chicken Alfredo and my wife ordered the catfish. Both dish were disappointing. I found the jerk chicken hardly tasted like jerk. There was ample chicken, but not enough pasta oddly enough. There were a lot more sauce for the pasta. You would figure that's where they would have sufficient serving for, but I guess this place would be good if you are watching your carb. This is the same with the catfish. They didn't serve it with enough rice. The catfish had a nice crisp, but again, bland. I left the place pretty hungry. Further to that, they tacked on 18% service charge probably because there was 8 of us, but I guess 18% is the new 15%? The service didn't even reflect that tip. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I am kind of torn about this place.   The drinks and the band are very much worth a visit.   The food left more to be desired. I had the etouffe and my friend at the fried catfish..mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Pulled Pork can be sublime. Here, just pedestrian at best.  Limited sauce ( which was good ) but pork was not fork tender."}
{"text":"I didn't get a chance to eat there but the music was great! I would defiantely go back. It's cozy and a great place to go on a date. The band that night was great (thursday). The drinks were cheap 5$ martinis!! We had great time.   www.joemamas.ca"}
{"text":"Went for drinks and it seemed like they weren't into making money because my drink was always empty. I could have drank probably 5 more drinks if the server cared."}
{"text":"! I SO love my life right now!!!this place is really love the vibe and the food and the people !!  I dropped in here while looking for a place that had food, drink and (hopefully) music. The color and energy of this place is what drew us into it. From the moment we arrived we knew we were in the right place. The setup of the place allowed us to sit at the bar (and eat there too) while being able to appreciate the band and (amazing) singer) without being overpowered by the volume. There was also places for you to sit and just enjoy the music while you're eating as well. I had a blast. Later I was told by a Canadian friend of mine back in LA and he was more excited about the fact that I'd been there than I was having GONE there. Now I know why. Go, go GO!!!!"}
{"text":"After a very long week, my friend and I decided to go along King Street for dinner on a Friday night. As there is a block of restaurants to choose from, we had difficulty finalizing on a place to eat. Fortunately for Joe Mamas, by the time we were in front of it, my feet were killing me (the joy of wearing heels to work) so we decided to just go into this establishment.  We were greeted by a friendly hostess who sat us right away. Before ordering food, the friend and I decided to order a drink. Their drink menu has a variety to choose from - all their drinks are named after Motown legends. The Marvin Gaye is what we decided on and had two glasses of it each. With our drinks came corn bread, which I found to be delicious.  The friend and I kept everything simple and ordered the exact same entree : the BBQ chicken breast with mushrooms and mashed potatoes. It wouldn't be right to rave about the entree because I truly think that I've had better elsewhere.  We left before the live music began, but I've heard from numerous sources that the music is always great. I wouldn't come here for simply the food, but for the experience. King Street has always been a favourite of mine. The atmosphere is great and there are so many places to check out after your meal.   For a reasonable night out with friends, start at Joe Mamas for dinner."}
{"text":"Looked interesting but was told we couldn't sit for dinner with our 12 and 10 year old at 9pm. Went to Nawlins a few places down. Very friendly and had a great time. We will just go there next time and not even bother with this place. Very rude."}
{"text":"We arrived at around 9pm it was busy but not packed. I should mention the hostess was extremely rude, the rest of the staff were great but when your first introduction to a place is someone being nasty, that's not a good look for your business.   We ended up getting seats at the bar, and ordering food, now here's where the food matches that nasty hostess' behaviour. One friend got the catfish sticks and that catfish was not fresh, as in they should not be serving that for human consumption. She took two bites and did not eat the rest. My other friend ordered the bbq chicken breast. The chicken breast was huge but when she bit into it it was rubbery, tasteless, and wet (????) she didn't finish it either. I had the calamari, which was tasteless but surprisingly not overcooked, it was the best thing out of the three things we ordered. Oh and the fries are good if not a little over salted.   The live music was okay, if not slightly boring. The demographic that night was 40+, I can speak to that being the trend every night since this was my first and last time at this place but the scene was a too mature for me (late 20s).   If you're looking for live music and southern cooking go to N'awlins down the street, better food, better service, and better music."}
{"text":"Friday night Summerlicious dinner. Awesome live music. Quick friendly service. Our group of four was impressed with the bourbon  ribs and strawberry cheesecake. Definately coming back"}
{"text":"We were able to snag a patio table to watch the street while we ate.  We were so early that the kitchen had not yet settled on a soup of the day (really fresh), which turned out to be chili.  Since He and She live in chili country, we passed, and had the daily special of blackened ribeye served with scallops and collard greens and the ribs and shrimp (also with the greens, which were freshly sautéed and some of the best we've had).  She had an interesting house drink called a James Brown (vodka and creme de cocoa)...twice.  Good meal, great service, reasonable price.  We have eaten many good meals in New Orleans, and this would stack up against the best."}
{"text":"One of my good friends adores Joe Mamas' jazz band, so I've joined him there on quite a few Thursdays over the years. The dark red walls of the dim, buzzy interior are great for kicking back and relaxing over live music played so loud that you won't even hear yourself think, let alone think of topics to talk about. It's almost always extremely busy and the availability of the distinct areas (sidewalk patio dining, inside dining, bar, and dance floor) is nice for changing things up.  I was recently brought back to Joe Mamas by the same friend on a weekend and was reminded of how seriously bustling the place gets. The R 'n B cover band played everything from Ginuwine to Bob Marley while the packed room swayed along in recognition. The token stagette party  was properly serenaded by the band. Our bottles of wine and mains took a very long time to be served by our visibly overworked server. The tables were also quite tight in the dining area. Despite being sat at the very farthest table possible from the stage, it was still impossible to hear any of my friends sitting across from me.  Food-wise, the blackened sirloin salad I had was simply over seasoned. The rack of ribs that my friend was nice enough to share was fantastic. I've generally enjoyed good food at Joe Mamas though. If I ever came just for the food, I'd certainly ask to sit on the patio. The music is loud enough to be heard across the street!"}
{"text":"Really nice restaurant. The Grilled Cajun Halibut was really good, as were the ribs. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant on a regular Wednesday night. The restaurant was empty except for 2 other tables. Most of the food was good. ( don't order the etouffee! it is gross) the prices are very high! and the music very very loud. this explains the empty dining area. The service was pitiful. Incredibly slow service even though there were only 3 tables. I would go again because of their good food... but I would first check to see how loud the  band was and how longer until the musicians ended their shift!... or I would go with someone I found boring... this way I wouldn't get to hear their conversation!"}
{"text":"Came here on Friday night around 8:30 PM for a friend's birthday. Overall experience was alright, but felt like something was lacking... mediocrity all-around in my opinion.  I ordered the Seafood Soul Pasta, which was underwhelming to say the least. The portion was a lot smaller than I expected. I will say there was a decent amount of seafood in the pasta, with scallops, tiger shrimp and lobster claw meat... however, that was pretty much the highlight. The Jack Daniel's bourbon tomato sauce was okay... you could kind of taste the Jack Daniel's, but for the most part it just tasted like regular tomato sauce. It was overall not a bad dish, but was disappointing for $24 because it felt like something I could have just thrown together at home myself.  I didn't order a drink myself, but I tried some of my friend's drink (Gladys Knight - Absolut Mandarin, triple sec, Malibu rum, grenadine, and pineapple juice) and it was QUITE strong... definitely a very strong alcohol flavour. I guess you do get your money's worth in terms of quantity of alcohol, but I wouldn't say it was super delicious or anything.  It was super super loud while we were there. Apparently there had been a band playing before I arrived, but the whole time I was there they were just blasting music from their stereo system. Kind of like older music. To be honest, I wasn't too much of a fan, since I felt like the music was too loud to have enjoyable conversation, and left my ears ringing a little.  Given the other positive reviews, I'm thinking maybe I just ordered the wrong thing? I wouldn't be opposed to potentially giving this place another try in the future, but my personal experience with it was just kind of meh."}
{"text":"Like the red themed interior. Didn't get to enjoy the live music. You can sit at the outdoor patio too and enjoy the awesome and busy street vibe. Nice selection of beers and drinks. Cajun chicken with wild rice and baked potato was very good. I would definitely come back on a weekend with live music and friends."}
{"text":"The live music was the innitial attraction. So we walked in and te quickly sat all 6 of us. Music was fantastic and so was the glass of cab. The food was incredible. We had the fried brie, which I could eat for days. Complete afrodisiac. Then we had the rack of ribs.......... Please do yourself a favor and eat here. I highly recommed this place. It has become my go to place in torontos entertainment district."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant!!! I was staying at the Hyatt Regency for the Fan Expo and my boyfriend and I got hungry so, we decided to check out the restaurants across the street. We stopped in our tracks when we saw a sign outside Joe Mamas for \"All You Can Eat Ribs.\" We high tailed it through the door and asked for a table. The waitress was so nice and helpful when it came to choosing a sauce for the ribs. They had probably 7 or 8 different home made sauces. The honey garlic was sticky, sweet, and delectable. Each plate contained a half a of a rack of ribs....not too shabby!   The restaurant was dimly lit except for some spotlights on the stage where a blues band had been playing. The walls were dressed with photos and memorabilia from musicians throughout history. I felt very comfortable and relaxed in this environment.   The only thing I did not like was the fact that I had to walk down a flight of dimly lit stairs to go to the bathroom. Other than that, I really enjoyed my experience here and I would definitely come back if I visit Toronto again.   Here are my ratings for Joe Mamas (1-5, 5 being the highest): Location: 5 Decor: 4 Parking: 2 (street parking) Bathroom cleanliness: 4 Restaurant cleanliness: 4 Wait staff: 4 Food: 5 Price: 4"}
{"text":"Yeah, well, the food or service did not rock my world. I arrived a little early in the evening, so with the restaurant empty sat at the bar and had food and drinks. Everything was, average. If you want an average night out, you will be happy.  Saw-dust on the floor might be a great option, then you could be fully justified in calling it a dive bar."}
{"text":"My pre-requisite for a Friday night: fun, casual, live band, good drinks and maybe a little dancing?!?! Am soooo glad we landed on Joe Mama's!! What a great hangout place =)  The live band was pretty unreal.... Soul, reggae, hip-hop ergo lots of dancing!! The crowd was lively and interactive. It just makes the experience 10x better!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so maybe I'm biased, being from the states and from a family with southern roots, but I just don't understand the rave reviews this place gets.  I mean, what kind of place claims to serve southern/soul food and doesn't have fried chicken on the menu?   As tourists during the Caribana festival, my friends and I had been walking around all day and were hungry, thirsty and tired.  One of my friends was in the mood for fried chicken so we figured this might be a good spot.  Despite my friend's disappointment when we found out fried chicken was not on the menu, we decided to stay since they had a good Sunday afternoon special going on...1/2 price starters, soups, and salads if you sat at the bar.  The place was pretty empty, probably because it was a bit early for dinner on a weekend.  The decor has a dark jazzy feel and there was a stage in the corner, but live entertainment didn't start until the 8 or 10 (understandably).  All the drinks are named after Motown singers.  I think I had the Gladys Knight which was very good and probably the best thing I ordered there.  For my meal,  I ordered the catfish sticks and the tiger shrimp salad.  The catfish was freshly made, hot and flaky, but had no seasoning or flavor.  Catfish is pretty bland on its own so it definitely needs good seasoning.  The tiger shrimp salad has a lot of fruit in it, which I liked, but the shrimp was over cooked and underseasoned.  My friends did not rave about their food either.  In addition, the food took a really long time to come out.  Yes, it was hot, but it doesn't take long to cook seafood or make a salad.    Maybe the night time scene/ entertainment scene make this place a hot spot but the food certainly does not."}
{"text":"What did you say about my mama?!  Hey Tiff, how was....  The Reason:  I was in Toronto for a girls weekend and we were looking for a late night spot to grab a drunk after a long flight.  To our delight, we were told to stop by Joe Mamas. The best advice, EVER!  The Scene:   Very chill, laid-back vibe.  Great for casual conversation with friends or hell strangers at the bar.  Great for an intimate dinner or out for drinks.  The Playlist: Live R&B music   The Drinks:  Good but not craft drinks  The Food:  Sorry guys, I was went for the drinks and music  The Service:  The bartender was nice but slow  The Dam$ge:  Responsibly priced - 10 - 15 dollars  The Location:  Toronto's entertainment district off King Street  The Parking:  There's a parking lot a few meters (look at me converting to meters vs. miles) down, short walk  The D'Over?:  100% - yes  Because you asked....  #WhereToGo #WhatToDo #WhereToParty #Toronto #Jetsetter @joemamastoronto  #RealMusic #TorontoNights #NightLife  #curatedlife #Toronto #Ask_Tiff   Where is Tiff?
