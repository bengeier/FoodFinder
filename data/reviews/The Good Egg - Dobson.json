{"text":"I ate here for the first time before going to the spa for my birthday. It was good food, and the hot sauce they have on the table was amazing- I wish I had written down the name! The waitress was kind of standoff-ish, she seemed weirded out that it was only me eating, and that I didn't have people with me. She didn't even attempt a smile... so other than the less than friendly waitress, the food it good, and fresh! Didn't have to wait long for it either."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple of times and have always been satisfied with the quality and quantity of my food. The reason I felt compelled to write this review is amazing customer service.

So my wife is particular about the way her over-medium eggs are cooked and this morning she ordered them this way and recieved them between over-easy and over-medium. Being the awesome wife that she is she remarked on it and proceeded to cut them up to eat anyways. As she was doing so, our server (Hope M.) approached and asked if her eggs were undercooked. She explained that she also eats them over-medium and saw that they were not perfect and already put in an order for perfectly cooked eggs. My wife and I were both impressed that without any complaints, the server paid so much attention to us that she noticed a little dissatisfaction and acted to remedy the situation. One thing that will always earn my gratitude and repeat visits is customer service and The Good Egg does it right!! Oh, and my Lumberjack Skillet was also yummylicious!"}
{"text":"I've live near this place & have gone there on at least a dozen occasions over the past several years. We're always at least slightly disappointed for one reason or another, though not necessarily deal breakers (service, food, screaming babies, etc). Though I actually walked out the last time about a year ago saying I won't go back, but this time it's for good! We'd only gone back today since we had enough stamps for a free plate & wanted something close. 

Almost 40 minutes for our food & it wasn't busy. Finally got my omelette & it was cooked at least 15 minutes prior, but my wife's BLT was thrown together in a hurry. My omelette came with a tiny cup of salsa, but they served it half spilled on my plate. The cashier wrongly hassled me about our diner stamps, then realized she was wrong yet no apology. Silent treatment from her after that. 

Food can be decent & so can the service, but we've never had those both happen at the same time. Today was their last chance. After today we only needed 1 more stamp for another free plate, but I threw them away so we won't be tempted to go back again."}
{"text":"There are some bizarrely noisy birds frequenting this location. 
Aside from that, I can't really complain about this reliable breakfast place. Mesa is lacking considerably in the morning-eats department so The Good Egg is the best you're going to get if you find yourself stuck in this armpit of Phoenix. 

Biggest plus in my book - their hash is the kind out of the red 'n' white checkered can. I loves me nothing more than an unabashed greasy-spoon start to my weekend."}
{"text":"Pros:
Lots of options to customize an order of pancakes. Fruit, chocolate, oatmeal, nuts, etc. Option for \"real\" maple syrup as an up-charge if you like

A fairly broad selection of other choices for breakfast and lunch, enough that most people will find something that they want.

On more than one occasion, they've offered a beverage \"to go\", either soda or coffee to take with after the meal, although this isn't offered every time. Still, was a nice touch when it was.


Cons:
Parking can be an issue.
Gets rather packed during peak hours
Not as much better than the big chains (Denny's, IHOP, Waffle House) as I'd have hoped."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place, and particularly this location, for years. Their menu is vast and I just love the selection. 99% of the time I'm in here for breakfast. Since I'm a pescaterian (and I eat poultry), I'm limited to what I order from the menu, but I've never had a bad plate. I love the nurse's bialy, the castroville omelette, the cloud 9, the crabby one and many more. I've been here once for lunch and their sandwiches are fantastic! 

Every time I've modified my order, they have never said they couldn't do it. They are always accommodating. Their service is great and always friendly. Food comes out hot, delicious and I've never turned down a plate due to a wrong order or something not cooked properly.

Keeping them from getting the coveted 5 star rating is their refusal to budge on charging me extra on the fruit bowl.  I'm allergic to melon and they charge me extra to modify the fruit bowl.... really?  Also, their coffee is less than desirable. Their flavored coffee is watery. But I don't come here for the coffee and they don't claim to specialize in it. On a few occasions, I've been served dirty glasses and flatware."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for eating breakfast. As the name implies, the menu revolves around mostly egg dishes. I've never had a meal I didn't like at this restaurant. I like to order the \"La Vida Loca.\""}
{"text":"Terrible service. The server never cleared our table so we were surrounded by dirty dishes throughout our entire meal. We had to ask for a refill while our server was rushing past us. After getting our meals no one checked on us so my fiancé had to get up from the booth & walk around the restaurant in search of an employee to ask for a bottle of mustard. When we paid our bill I took out our loyalty cards for a stamp. It would be our tenth stamp, meaning we would get a free meal at our next visit. The cashier told us they no longer honored them. We asked to speak with a manager, I believe her name was Hope. I asked if they would at least honor these because it would be the last stamp. She denied my request. It's really dishonorable for a company to promise their loyal customers something to keep them coming back & then back out of it when the time comes to reward them. I thanked her and told her we wouldn't be back, & we won't. There are so many other restaurants out there that have tastier food anyway."}
{"text":"I don't waste my time and money anywhere else. I'm kinda baffled at any negative reviews,  but you cannot have the ying without the yang I guess. I would give this place 6 stars if they had waffles.   I like the pineapple upside down pancakes and their $1 menú sides. I have had 5 different dishes. All have been superb. Huge portions,  excellent sides and substitutions. They have ruined IHOP for me. I'd rather eat at the good egg and spend the extra $10 for a family of 4. We still leave with leftovers and aren't hungry again until 4 in the afternoon. Plus village inn is just hot garbage."}
{"text":"Great omelets. Good food all around. Pretty friendly staff and reasonable prices. It's a good breakfast place for sure."}
{"text":"Breakfast was good and the place was clean. Nothing too catchy as far as theme, probably would not go back unless i am in the area."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Tons of lovely options. Everything is big portions. I love the green eggs and ham as well as the mile high omelette."}
{"text":"Took these guys 5 minutes to do what Waffle House took 20 minutes for! And for that they get a 5! Obviously sunday  mornings are busy but these guys/girls have an obvious grasp on that. Good: service/food/experience! Would recommend in the future!"}
{"text":"Have been to this Good Egg many times, the food never disappoints. Great place for breakfast or lunch and even coffee!"}
{"text":"Used to love it here, got violently sick last time I ate here. Don't get anything with too many veggies, I don't think they're properly washed. The bananas Presley pancakes are godly though."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. They have the best coffee and pancakes ever. The wait staff is always amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Service was okay, never offered water and the ice tea glass went dry for a couple minutes. Food was good and reasonably priced for the intent of a quick breakfast, not the case though about 25 min to get food once ordered whiched seem to be what everyone else was experiencing at that time. Overall decent but not a have to go back like some other breakfast joints."}
{"text":"Yummy! Fresh food and good service! I had the castroville omlette. Tasty! I do wish they has hasbrowns instead of diced potatoes but that is just my preference. Our server was friendly and definitey took care of us. We went on a sunday and it was pretty busy but we didnt suffer from that at all. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Mrs Q and myself visited this establishment today and was extremely impressed with the service here.  The atmosphere is pleasant and there was no wait to be seated.  We did arrive at 11 and the place was pretty full but still the breakfast crowd.  I always love the flavored coffee.  I would highly recommend any of there omelettes or the pancakes.  Mrs Q got the rocky mountain omelette and loved it.

The best part of the menu is that it informs you of how many calories each meal has right next to the meal.  This might help you make a well informed decision on what to eat if you're on a diet.

{"text":"well two stars it is. I bit my tongue wile checking out but let me tell you I was let down. First, I find a bug in my water. I ask for a refill cup all is well,  but I ordered a smoothie and that was also a disappointing use of 4 dollars. As we leave my server rabecca wants to know if I'd like some waters to go? We both know I would not like waters to go. I was a first timer here so I know my experience doesn't hold weight but I will not be back."}
{"text":"This was our second time here and they didn't disappoint! The food is fantastic! They have monthly pancake specials which are to die for, dessert for breakfast for sure! Last month it was peach cobbler pancakes and this month it's blueberry lemon and almond. Their eggs benedict is amazing as well. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! You can call ahead and have your food in no time. I use to live close by and would treat myself to this restaurant on the weekends! The staff is friendly and service is quick :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I lovingly call this location \"our spot\"... We come here almost every weekend. We started coming here before the transition to First Watch (about 6 months ago), but the menu items were being added- the food is delicious, and they have multiple clean eating options including juices squeezed daily- they're a tad different visit to visit so it's nice to know they're fresh and made in house THAT day. The atmosphere has been slowly changing, and the First Watch look is nice, very clean and modernized with darker wood, chalkboard accents, and neat decorative hanging lights. I haven't had issues with cold food, and I don't pay attention to wait times unless it's sincerely notable, like over 45 minutes, so I can't comment on that. Overall, I've had great experiences each time I've come here, save for one or two servers who aren't very attentive when we get them, which is the reason for 4 stars as opposed to 5. 

I feel like the people complaining about \"missing 'The Good Egg' are old, and I mean it ok, you're old- your taste buds go- you start liking bland food... Hey, that's alright, it happens, but the Good Egg was nothing to write home about. I had eaten there 3 or 4 times in the past 3 years (I live across the street, so it's very convenient) and it was always similar to the experience and food quality of a village inn, which if that impresses you, and village inn is your cup of tea, then there's one across the 60 on southern and Dobson, quit your griping and go there. Whoever cooked at the Good Egg couldn't ever get my food right or even hot. I had such a bad experience here the time before we decided to give it \"one last chance\" in fact, that the manager at the time didn't charge for our meal, which sucks, it wasn't her fault that jerk couldn't cook, or my waiter couldn't record the order correctly; whatever the case was... The only reason we came back is because she gave us a gift card, but I'm glad we decided to go back when we did (about 8 months after that had happened) when we noticed there were new menu signs out front."}
{"text":"My sister is a huge fan of this place.  She insisted that my whole family descend on it for breakfast one of the days we were visiting, and we weren't disappointed.  They have healthy options (like the Bialy breakfast thing I got, yummy), as well as less healthy options like scrambles with sausage and Hollandaise sauce or huge cinnamon rolls, apparently also quite yummy.  Our waitress was wonderful - all of our dozen meals were out at about the same time, without problems, and we were kept stocked with waters, coffees, and OJs the entire time.  I'd highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This chain seriously has the best pancakes in the world, hands-down!  We always trek out here whenever in the PHX area.

Coffee could use some work, but heck, I'm a Seattleite."}
{"text":"I feel the meal didn't justify the price. If locally grown meant it can reach an elitist price, than I learned something new for breakfast. Before, I thought breakfast was about getting full to start a good day. When I  was served nearly a carbon copy of Denny's, I feel vexed knowing I agreed to a 30% price hype. Service was alright though."}
{"text":"I have come here a few more times to give it a second chance, and after today my family won't be returning to The Good Egg (on Dobson). My egg sandwich was subpar, but my husband's eggs Benedict was inedible. We had told the manager about his eggs, and the manager did not empathize. We had to basically ask him for new eggs (awkward!), and when my husband finally got his new eggs Benedict they were even worse--hurried, not poached, and oily beyond belief. Truly inedible.  But we didn't want to be \"those guys,\" so we just wanted to quietly leave and pay our bill. The manager stopped us on the way out to ask why my husband didn't eat his eggs, and we told him they were awful. He was polite enough to remove them from our bill, which is why I'm giving 2 stars rating (rather than 1 star). 

For a place called \"the good egg,\" y'all need to learn how to poach a flippin egg!!!!! Basics of cooking. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst service in the entire town of Mesa. Our server was young with braces and the one of the most air headed persons I've ever met. After confirming that I wanted my eggs sunny side up 2 different times she still brought them out scrambled like I wouldn't notice. The food also took 40+ minutes to get out of the kitchen. I'll never be back. Fudge this place."}
{"text":"The staff at this restaurant is great.  They are prompt in getting your meal to you, good at refilling drinks, and so pleasant.  The food is consistently good and we love breakfast out at least once per week.  However, since the restaurants were bought out from the individual owner the prices have gone up quite a bit and the menu is briefer.  We'll probably start trying new places and this has been our go to breakfast location for over ten years.  Very sad."}
{"text":"This location is a bit more lively than the one I'm used to going in Scottsdale.  So if you like a younger crowd, this location is for you!  It has a more \"get em in & out\" vibe.  I prefer to \"luxuriate\" when I eat, so the Scottsdale location is my preference.  The waitresses here are very sweet (and busy), so I appreciate their service.  Be careful of the pancake sizes!  One waitress neglected to tell me how large the regular pancakes were!  Although they were good, I had leftover pancakes for days!!  The standout meal I've had here was the Apple Crunch Crepes! Yum!"}
{"text":"This has been one of our favorite breakfast places for years. It has changed to new managment we have gone in 3 times since then and had horrible experiences each time. The bacon was the best in town nice thick bacon, now thin & blah. Each time we've  gone back since it's changed the food has been brought to us cold. One of those times I didn't even get my food until everyone else was done eating. Since the change we have not had 1 good experience. We were told when coming into the restaurant that they would honor our Good Egg punch card then when paying the second manager agrued with my husband stating that she would not honor it and whom ever told us that was incorrect not good customer service. 
 We will not be going back even though it used to be our go to place for years. I won't eat and pay for Cold food."}
{"text":"The Sunrise Benedict, delicious!   Fresh avocado and tomato, yum!! Freshly squeezed OJ. And our server Dave was very friendly and great customer service.   A must stop every year we are in the area."}
{"text":"I love this Good Egg location. The food is delicious, the staff is friendly, and the pancakes are the best around. Great place for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Super good as always! Got the lumber jack skillet which was a great choice. Always make sure to get a side of Veracruz sauce!"}

{"text":"Tired. The place seems tired.

I always thought of it a step above Denny's.

I had spinach Benedict . Poached eggs were severely undercooked, muffin was burned. Waitress came by three times. Once for order, once for food and once for check. I got charged 3 bucks for each small glass of watered down orange juice. Potatoes were hurried, meaning burned on outside and cold inside. Couple next to meet moved due to all the kitchen noise with Mostly empty restaurant.

Manager seemed nice but could not make up for a bad meal and mediocre service."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this still doesn't help my experience that my 3rd trimester, pregnant girlfriend and I had at the Dobson location, so I'm still giving this one star. Like I stated in my last review, someone called me supposedly from First Watch, yet, when I ran the cell number under identity search, I got nothing, except that it was a Verizon number (NUMBER REDACTED TO COMPLY WITH YELP GENERAL CONTENT GUIDELINES)

I went through the effort of transferring the voicemail *.3gp file to my computer, ran it through Audacity, ran the audio through an equalizer.. I THINK it was from Kevin Hall, who is the VP of Operations at Good Egg according to LinkedIn (THIS COMPLIES WITH YELP GENERAL GUIDELINES: \"don't post other people's full names unless you're referring to service providers who are commonly identified by or commonly share their own full names\" THIS IS PUBLIC ON LINKEDIN A SOCIAL MEDIA PROVIDER)

Anyway, in the voicemail, the caller says they're from First Watch. So, is the caller really Kevin Hall or not?

I texted the number seeking clarification, but I never got a response. I don't call numbers that I can't verify with secondary verification online first, that's just stupid from a cybersecurity standpoint.

All in all, a customer should not have to go through all this effort just to figure out who is calling me to handle a customer service issue. State WHO you are (Kevin Hall?), WHAT you are (VP Operations?) and WHY you are calling me in your voicemail (to handle a social media complaint). Only one of these things were stated in the voicemail I received, and was so muffled I couldn't tell who they were at first.

EDIT 5/9/2016 10:31 PM: To clarify, Yelp removed my review for containing personal information and referred me to their general content guidelines. So, I re-wrote my review to be compliant with said guidelines."}
{"text":"Our server Christie was awesome. She had an awesome and upbeat personality. Anything we needed she was on it. A lot of the times she just brought it before we even asked. It was like she was in tune with us and our food. 

I ordered the nurse bialy from the lighter side of the menu, but I ordered regular eggs. I found it was a very good meal. My wife ordered macho nacho. She liked it a lot, and she loves the coffee."}
{"text":"Breakfast is pretty much breakfast, but there are more combinations of those staple 5 ingredients here than at most eggjoints.  The inside is country cutesy and clean.  There's an outside patio but its small and the sun always seems to hit you right in the eyes no matter when you're out there.   The healthy items dont taste bad which makes the place a keeper.   Only open until early afternoon, but hey its better than Dennys."}
{"text":"I have passed by this place several time just because I thought the name was strange. Well never again. I thought the portions were excellent. The waitress was fabulous and the atmosphere was relaxing. I would definitely bring my family here for breakfast from now on. Oh and the price advertised by the front door says no meal over ten dollars."}
{"text":"Great food.  I ordered \"green eggs n ham\" and substituted turkey sausage....it was delish. The flavors went together so well.  I also had a berry smoothie that was good as well."}
{"text":"This was the best breakfast I have ever had. I had the veggie skillet with a small side of pancakes. Great friendly service."}
{"text":"I typically don't give a place 5 stars unless the food knocks me off my chair but today The Good Egg on Dobson does. Christie was our server and she was super friendly. I ordered the eggs Benny and the sauce wasn't up to par. I made mention of it and asked if their batch was typ like this. They offered to bring me a new one or asked if I wanted to order off the menu, which I declined saying I would just eat around the sauce.. No biggie! But low and behold they bring me a new plate of Benny which my husband ended up eating. When we got the bill we noticed they didn't charge us for either Benny's and we asked if they could since I ate one but they insisted. So they get an awesome review today. We've been going here since we moved to the area in August and will continue to go here for brunch in the future."}
{"text":"Stopped here while visiting from out of state, food tasted amazing, good sized portions and reasonably priced. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"We have come here more than a few times over the years. Today we came around lunch time, just missing the rush!
 We got a nice booth for starters. Our server was Annette ,she was friendly and very quick with everything.
I got the Lumberjack scramble. It was a lot of food and I ordered an English Muffin instead of the bisquits that come with it. Lots of gravey,(Country style) I liked it but, I had to scrape some off because, it is so much. Something else that they had,that I thought was pretty good was the Marion Berry jam.
T got The Krabby one,it is an Egg crepe (made with Crab) I had some and it was really good ,nice and light.
I have to say there potatoes are awesome and the coffee is nice. Not bitter at all.
We have always been happy with our meal at all the locations.
Something else to love is the stamp card system they have. so many stamps and you get one meal free. Gotta love that!"}
{"text":"The service was decent and the place felt homely. The only, and most important, problem was that the food kinda sucked."}
{"text":"Food is healthy. Staff is attentive.  Pricing is on point. Food also tastes great. Great location. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Place had a dingy diner feel to it.  I ordered Eggs Benedict with my eggs hard poached (I KNOW I am probably the only person who likes them that way, but that is beside the point).  Was super awkward when I poked the egg in front of the waiter and yolk poured out :(  Once I got my food back properly cooked, I discovered the only good thing about it was the English muffin!  Their hollandaise sauce was SOOO salty.  Also ordered bread pudding and it tasted like it had been soaked in raisin flavored syrup or something.  Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this Good Egg in months. Had brunch with my sweetie on a Friday. 

We were seated quickly and offered inside or out. Our server greeted us within five minutes and offered menus and coffee. The service slowed a bit after that but it was rather busy so it was okay. 

My wife ordered the special: a chorizo scramble with poblanos, onions, cheese and potatoes, plus coffee. I ordered the Eggs Benedict, juice and a side of crispy bacon. 

The coffee and juice arrived about ten minutes later, which pleased my wife since she was cold. Brunch arrived shortly after. 

The scramble was disappointing because it was just a muddle. I know a scramble is a mixture of ingredients but this one really didn't sing. None of the ingredients took center stage. 

Mine was very good, except for the slightly undercooked potatoes. The bacon was crispy as requested, the English muffin was toasty, there was plenty of hollandaise sauce (although somewhat tame flavors) and the egg was cooked to perfection. 

We've had Good Egg before and we will again, hopefully with better results."}
{"text":"Too crowded and too small a waiting area.  Kind of becoming an ihop breakfast place, not unique anymore when everyone comes here.  Not too impressed by the seats they have and how close you are to the other tables.

Food is good with a large variety of choices and creation.   I believe they have been adding items to their menu based on what their customers order and thus a lot of the menu items are just variations and customizations with some items different from another menu item.  I think if other newer breakfast place are around longer, they would start doing that and also end up with a good egg menu, cluttered and full of items.  Good and bad if you ask me.  Gives everyone a chance to find something 
they like.  But makes it look full and unorganized.

Would be a backup breakfast place I bring friends to if they are from out of town, I can think of 2 nearby which are more unique."}
{"text":"This has become our Saturday morning, post Weight  Watchers meeting, breakfast hangout. Love the Nurse's breakfast, my fiancée typically gets the breakfast tacos. Good service, front patio is nice, the side patio is too cramped for my taste. Parking can be tight during peak hours so carpool if possible."}
{"text":"Sure do miss our OLD Good Egg.  Many things have changed from the menu to the prices.  We as regulars will be looking for a new regular place.  The only up side is that there appears to not be a wait for a table any longer.  That is most likely due to the increase in prices and the abrupt end to their frequent customer stamp cards.  We were a group of 4 and used 4 full stamp cards (Which equals nearly 30 paid meals).  It still were charged almost $20 for the drinks.  Too bad So Sad to say Good Bye.   We are looking for a new Regular spot."}
{"text":"I've been going to the good egg for breakfast since I moved to Phoenix in 1999...while there are some breakfast restaurants in the Phoenix area that have some amazing dishes, The Good Egg is just the perfect all around breakfast place...not a greasy spoon place, something for everyone from their great huevos rancheros to their fruit plate and to my favorite the traditional breakfast (more well done on the potatoes is my preference) they just do it right...whether busy or slow, the food comes out pretty quick, the servers are all very pleasant and do a great job, they have a frequent dinning program for free breakfast, the place is light and always spotless, and prices are reasonable...my go to breakfast joint and well worth the visit!!"}
{"text":"Dude...who can hate on the Good Egg? I've been frequenting several of the Good Egg/ Eggery locations for many years now and it's amazingly consistent. I'm just throwing the review down for this location since I make it here more than the others now, and I was here Sunday afternoon. 
I always get the same item regardless of what location I'm at: the three cheese omelet with bacon which comes with the addictive country potatoes and an English muffin. It's perfect every single time! I can only remember one out of a few dozen times that it was a little too greasy. Besides that, it's admirable how consistent they are with the quality of their food. Then this past Sunday my lady got the biscuits and gravy and I had the distinct pleasure of trying that for the first time...so so good. Plus I'm an iced tea junkie and the Good Egg has some of the best in town. 
I use to have issues with slow service at some Good Eggs, but the Dobson location rarely has that issue. It was usually the Frank Lloyd Wright location that had horrendously slow service. But I think that was more the fault of management mishandling staff as opposed the servers. 
Plus, who doesn't love the unintentional hilarity of the hokey interior design of the Good Egg? It's like they had members of a retirement center do the interior decorating...I love it. 
So all in all, due to the quality and consistency of the food, I'll still take the Good Egg over any newer, trendier breakfast places that I've tried (I'm looking at you, Over easy)."}
{"text":"The restaurants entrance is very dirty and unapealing the carpet had stuff all over it that is something that should be continuously cleaned up. Server needs to introduce her self and welcome you and ask if there were any questions .. The manager seemed to be upfront putting people's name down. I think the manager should be overlooking and not be upfront unless ur dressed up nicely rather than wearing jeans and a dirty t shirt and constantly picking his nose.. Thats just disgusting .. Put a younger girl with a smile to greet customers and take their names down.... I cant stand servers or workers in restaurant with DIRTY clothes .. Though our server was very sweet and nice but other ones werent. The crepe looked nothing like french crepes i've had It was soaked in sauce and tons of whipped cream. I did not like it at all. The lumberjack skillet was descent except ginormous chunks of potatoes  ... If you want low quality food in a not so clean restaurant then this is your place.. It scares me to think how dirty the kitchen is. I dont have crazy high expectation in food but this is disappointing. To the owner; please improve the esthetic of this place with some nice flowers and nice decoration. It is repulsive as soon as you walk in and stop picking your nose. One of my worst restaurant experience living in USA for 16 yrs.."}
{"text":"The owners at First Watch are trying to polish a turd here.  Taking the turd that is The Good Egg and nailing reclaimed wood on the walls does not consist of a new and modern restaurant. This is the same kitchen with the same cooks and wait staff and same tired menu.  We tried the Avocado toast which turned out to be rancid guacamole toast.  The water comes with no ice in a carafe but it is not filtered, what restaurant does not serve filtered water in Arizona, come on, a R.O. unit costs pennies/gallon.  The coffee is worse than the free coffee at Home Depot!"}
{"text":"We got the lumberjack, the mushroom caps and the eggs Benedict with spinach. The food came out a little slow but was very good. Their golden roast coffee is very good and the hot sauces are delicious   Good breAkfast!"}
{"text":"I rarely go here not because its not good but because there really isn't one fairly close to me. But when I do it's for special occasions! I love everything on their menu, from the standard ol' breakfast (eggs/pancakes) to a hot breakfast burrito or skillet. Everything is amazing."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast while visiting some family in AZ...must recommend the Macho Nacho and the fresh squeezed apple juice...fast service, nice staff...couldn't ask for too much more!"}

{"text":"Average breakfast place with average food, average service, average prices for breakfast foods, etc. 
If you go before the massage place next door open up, the parking is not too bad, but once they are open the parking is VERY tight."}
{"text":"There was no real wait for a group of six which helps when two of them are my younglings :). My kids' food was worth the $5 in flavor and portion.
I got eggs scrambled well (which are hard to do w/o turning them to rubber) -they were cooked beautifully. I also enjoyed their not overly salted bacon. The country potatoes were recommended. Alas, they were cooked fine but very very very under seasoned. My brother let me try his Pueblo X skillet and the flavor profile w/the chirizo was awesome!!
Overall food was good. However, the cleanliness of the restaurant can only be described by the sticky table, dishwasher residue on the glasses, and bees in the window."}
{"text":"Okay all,  we have not been here much lately.   The menu, atmosphere and staff have all gone through changes.   However, I found a new favorite dish.   THE AVOCADO TOAST  IS AWESOME!Also trying the Kale Tonic..  WOW!!  I must say I am hooked!!  Its not a traditional breakfast staple. I would consider this a breakfast treat!  For working a long hard week, my reward."}
{"text":"Went back to try their other dishes. This time I had the Breakfast Tacos at the suggestions of one of the hostess at the front. It was very tasty and twice is good as the last dish I tried which was the Potencia. I ate those Breakfast Tacos and was quite full. The tacos had no meat and was filled with egg whites which was quite unique. It went very well with the salsa, beans, avocado and green Tabasco sauce. The tastiness was there!

Staff was accommodating and very friendly. Orange juice was awesome like last time. Next time I go, I'll try their Organic Apple Juice and have their staff recommend something good again."}
{"text":"First things first: I am not a morning person. And as such, frequenting breakfast restaurants aren't real high on my must-do list. At least at home I can eat my pancakes with my hair all nasty and one eye open.

But I was coaxed out of my hovel one morning and discovered the joys of The Good Egg. I never know there were SO MANY ways to cook eggs! And, judging by my dish and the tastes I stole off my companions', all of them at The Good Egg are very good. For those not too hot on eggs, they also serve bakery items, sandwiches and others. 

One neat thing about The Good Egg is that when it gets crowded they serve coffee, water and mini-portions of their baked items in the waiting area."}
{"text":"THE STORY (THEN)

I first reviewed this location of the The Good Egg as a 1 star out of 5 stars about 7 months ago and it's almost like I had ESP about coming back to give them another try.

I felt horrible that I had such a bad experience, especially since I have been coming to this Dobson location for well over 20 years, but it legitimately deserved the poor review. 

THE STORY (NOW)

Anyway, I got the urge to go back and give them another chance, and wow, was I pleasantly surprised!

Apparently, First Watch has purchased The Good Egg and has been doing serious makeovers on all of the locations, and the Dobson location was just renovated about a week ago. The decor is now bright and fresh, with wood tables, new wood floors and cute edgy lighting. (see pics)

Unfortunately, there were still several messy tables and dirty condiment bottles, even though the place was pretty empty. It seemed like either everyone was in back or they were understaffed, but I was so pleased to see so much progress, I didn't mind.

The menu is now a mixture of The Good Egg and First Watch. I got the Day Glow juice (carrot, orange, lemon and organic ginger) from the First Watch menu, which was super yum. And I got the berry blinzes from The Good Egg menu, which were very much improved from 7 months ago. I think I'm just not a big fan of heavy berry compote in general, but the filling was a lot better, with fresh strawberries and blueberries inside. (see pics)

SERVICE EXPERIENCE 

The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.

CONCLUSION 

I love to see a comeback success story and Dobson location of The Good Egg/First Watch has definitely made some serious positive changes, which I hope just keep getting better!

I will definitely come back!

{"text":"I picked this place for breakfast to take a friend that was in from out of town, wanted to take him someplace that isn't a chain (ihop). We got to their around 12:30ish, the place was still busy, however they were starting to remove the chairs to the tables outside, but to be honest it was already 80 something outside & I wanted in the in ac not the heat. About 85% of the menu is egg base, not too sure about the sandwiches they offer cuz to be honest I can't make it past their breakfast menu. I ordered the spanish omelet that came with the county potatoes, which are my fav, english muffin and I even ordered some buttermilk pancakes....man everything was DELISH!!! I finished everything. My friend ordered the lumberjack frittata which looked like heaven on a plate and came with a homemade biscuit, next time I go I think I am going to try that! We both had the coffee, which for restaurant coffee was good and the service was good as well. If you are in the mood for a good country breakfast & don't want the normal chain give The Good Egg a try, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"It was decent. I got a pretty traditional plate with eggs, bacon, and potatoes. The eggs and potatoes were perfect, but the bacon was sub-par quality and taste. My daughter had the yogurt parfait which was awesome and delicious. I gave The Good Egg 3 stars because nothing really stood out to me: the people, place, or the food..."}
{"text":"Always a great go-to breakfast place, especially if you want somewhere a little different than a Denny's. The wait is never too long during the week but be prepared to wait an hour or so on the weekends and the parking lot is super tiny so you may need to park on the residential street close by. They offer healthy options, such se the Nurse Bialy breakfast (one of my favorites!) and aren't too expensive. The service isn't fast so don't plan on getting out of here quick if you are on a schedule. They also offer a punch card and double stamps I believe on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"BY FAR the best breakfast place I have ever been to. I love when restaurants are consistent. Every time I come in, I am greeted by the friendliest staff around. No matter how busy they are they always say hi with a smile. It can get busy but the wait is never too long. The food tastes perfect every time. Very fast service as well. 

I ALWAYS order the Light one, it is wonderful. It is an omelet with crepe over it. I sub the toast for little pancakes (no charge) I have tried other things on the menu and they are so good as well. 

They are great at splitting checks! I cannot say enough great things about good egg. I ALWAYS crave it"}
{"text":"My Thanksgiving hangover made me wake up and yearn for a spicy omelet.  After annoying the boy to wake up at 8:30 after a long night, he eventually gave in and insisted that he would only take me if we went to The Good Egg over U.S Egg.  Fine, as long as I could get my spicy omelet.

Standard Good Egg location, but bigger than the one I have been to.  The service is always fast, friendly and consistent and today was no different.  They always seem to realize that breakfast should be a fast meal.

My La Vida Loca was awesome, as usual.  As was my sinful hot chocolate.  

The Good Egg is consistent and I am happy to know what I am getting when I head there for breakfast.  

Minus one star for the kitchiness and lack of mimosas."}
{"text":"This place is not for people that enjoy a freshly cooked breakfast.  The microwave their food.  The omelets are not made on a grill and they lack taste.  I ordered a veggie omelet and the vegetables were not cooked.  They were merely heated up.  Skip this place and go somewhere that puts care into how they cook their food!!!!"}
{"text":"Aaaaaahhhhh, my good friend The Good Egg.  You can't ever go wrong at this place.  I've said it once and I'll say it again, whole wheat pancakes with walnuts and oatmeal.  I know it sounds weird but trust me.  I always add a few of those to my Monterey omelet and it's heaven on a plate.  Needless to say I'm a pig.  I also like that they put a pot of coffee on the table and will bring you sugar free syrup to help trick yourself into thinking that what you are eating is good for you."}
{"text":"I'm so bummed that First Watch has ruined The Good Egg. This used to be one of our go-to breakfast places but after our last visit I doubt we will ever go back. 

While many items on the menu seem the same they have cheapened the quality of their ingredients. For example, Good Egg had really good bacon. Now the bacon is thin, cheap, blah bacon.

Another example: I ordered oatmeal that came with the muffin of the day. When I asked the server \"what kind of muffin?\" she said \"I dunno, whatever they have back there.\" Okay... So the surprise muffin was a banana nut on the level of a gas station Otis Spunkmeyer garbage muffin. Blech. No thanks.

Also, they no longer do the loyalty cards. Lame. 

Alas, it's time to find a new place for pancakes."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of the wait, the run down location or all the birds attacking you for the food.  The food was great, but the atmosphere was kind of annoying."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service, reasonable prices and the french toast was big, fluffy and delicious. If you don't beat the morning rush expect to have to wait a while. On the plus side they do offer complimentary coffee while you wait.   How busy it gets is definitely a testament to the quality of the restaurant."}
{"text":"We frequent this place often and the service and food are excellent every time. On the weekends it can get rather crowded for early breakfast and brunch, but it's well worth the wait.  We are eating Paleo so it's hard for us to find places with variety that meet our lifestyle.  The Good Egg certainly does. I like flavorful sauces and salsas and Good Egg has a great selection. Eggs, bacon, avocado and salsa, all tasty and well done.  They also have daily specials and a daily speciality tea. It suits my breakfast needs perfectly."}
{"text":"Ate here on my lunch break about a week ago and received amazing service. My waitress was Erin. She was attentive and efficient. Definitely one of the best if not the best waitresses I've ever had. I work nearby and will be coming back often. It's always hard to find a restaurant who will give you fast and good quality service during the lunch hour so it's nice to have found a new place."}
{"text":"I love the Good Egg/First Watch and the one on Dobson, north of Baseline, is especially good!  Ryan our server was very attentive, polite, and his service was excellent.
The service was especially good.  I always order the avocado toast and the cucumber/mint drink which is always fantastic.  The eggs were done to a perfection.
I always return and will continue doing so!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. 
They were busy, but wait time quoted was accurate. Biscuits and gravy tasted home-made, pancakes were fluffy. 
Coffee was excellent. 
Service was adequate: not bad/not stellar."}
{"text":"Had a whole-wheat pancake with double servings each of blueberries and glazed pecans here two Tuesdays ago (Tuesdays are double-stamp days at the Dobson location).  Nice-sized pancake- its diameter was the size of the plate, which is the usual.  Wish I could say the same of this week's visit at the Central Ave. location (this past Monday; please refer to my review and photos).  I also ordered an Isle of Capri omelette for my lunch later that day.  Good portion (the platter included an English muffin and country potatoes) which easily feeds two.  Would've included a photo, but I didn't think it looked great folded in a styrofoam box...  Don't let the scent of feta and olives turn you off from trying it.  It is delicious!"}
{"text":"Was very good, non greasy and healthy.  A great choice.  Service was fast and friendly.  We sat on the patio with outside temperature at 59 degrees but with the patio heaters was perfect for a nice Sunday morning.   I had the Rocky Mountain Omelet which was the perfect amount and was delicious."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I ordered tea w honey and lemon and they bought out a whole bowl of lemon and a huge honey dispenser. The monte Cristo sandwich was delicious. Turkey, ham and bacon on a cinnamon toast and Havarti. The biscuits and gravy were fresh and delicious. Our waitress was accommodating and the service was fast."}
{"text":"I have been going here for breakfast.. Love their flavored coffees!! Service is always good. Great, huge, pancakes!! Cinammon rolls are to die for. They also have a great hamburger.. Would highly recommend for breakfast and lunch!!"}
{"text":"Im in town from Southern CA, found this location with high ratings. 

They dont have specialty coffee, can't seem to find decent coffee in arizona period. I ordered an iced coffee. They brought it out in a big gulp cup which I though was ridiculous with a side of creamers. Not impressed at all, but I guess it will do.

I ordered the traditional breakfast.  2 scrambled eggs, bacon, english muffin and potatoes. The eggs were DISGUSTING,  they taste watery. The potatoes did not taste fresh, they tasted reheated.  The bacon and english muffin were delicious which is the only reason im goving it 2 stars"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast spots. You get quick-kind service...even on the busy weekend mornings. 

You'll never go wrong with their whole wheat pancakes! Ask them to mix in some bananas, walnuts, blueberries and oatmeal & you'll be all set!"}
{"text":"I waited for 15 minutes for someone to come to my table.  No coffee or water offered,  no one came, yet there were more than enough waitstaff standing around. I have been going to this establishment at least once a week for years and witnessed a gradual decline in service and quality. I will not be there to see any further decline, since I will not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"I like the Good Egg.  Really, I do.  I have eaten here sporatically at a few different locations.  This one gets busy, obviously, but not as busy as the other locations, from what I have noticed.

Anyways, I came here this AM for breakfast.  I was out and about when I realized I was starving. I usually dont keep breakfast food in the house, so I knew it was time to stop.

Came here and the service was quick and efficent.  I was in and out of here in no time.   I had scrambled eggs, an english muffin and hash browns.  Food was tasty!!

I will probably be back.  Rock on Good Egg!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly staff. I recommend the huevos rancheros for only $7.50! Sometimes the lines are a bit long on the weekends, but they churn people pretty quickly and it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Had the crepegg - sort of a crepe with an omelet in it. The food was ok nothing special. The coffee was ok as well. If I need to go to a breakfast chain again I think I'll chose the nearby IHOP over the good egg. The booths are massive and can easily fit six people comfortably. I didn't have the pancakes but thought it was weird that they charge extra if you want the real maple syrup."}
{"text":"Service can make or break a business, and in this instance, it totally made the difference.

Coffee was piping hot and fresh. The waitress was pleasant and checked in on us. The food was good. Nothing spectacular, but satisfying. 

However, one in our party had a problem in the kitchen with his breakfast and, as a result, had his food come out last. Instead of being freshly made, his food was lukewarm. Already having to wait, he ate his breakfast and didn't mention it to the waitress.

When it came time to pay, the man at the register asked how everything was and we mentioned it was just ok, and that one person didn't have a hot breakfast. He said that since we weren't completely happy, he took that meal off the bill! We were all pretty surprised at this display of customer service, since we weren't even looking to complain. 

I also noticed they had coffee and iced tea available outside near the front door for people waiting to be seated. It's a nice gesture that says they care about making people happy."}
{"text":"It seems that First Watch has ruined my favorite place to go for breakfast. I used to be in there every day and was known as a regular. While the food is still good, the staff and atmosphere are terrible. The makeover looks nice, but the overall feel is bad. They're often short tempered, the wait times are terrible and when I call in a Togo order, I've been placed on hold for more than five minutes and or hung up on. They're just seems to be no cohesion as a team, or care for the guest any longer
 Sad"}
{"text":"Actually have been coming in here everyday for a week for an early morning breakfast within walking distance from my hotel room. The staff (Dobson location) is great and the food has been consistently good. My standard has been the light, 'traditional' breakfast of scrambled eggs and bacon with vegetable soup and tomato slices (or sub in avocado) for $9, which I broke for a daily special one day: Cheesy eggs, mushrooms, tomato and bacon in a skillet with accompanying sides for about $11... Very delicious!"}
{"text":"I'll give this Good Egg 3 stars for standard breakfast food.  We came on a very busy Sunday and our food still arrived fast and fresh.  Many a chain diner or breakfast place cannot pull that off.  I've never really understood why that is.  Breakfast & diner food is short order stuff and should move out of the kitchen quickly.

Our server bordered on an attitude when we were seated but quickly regained his composure.  I guess he was just flustered.  I have not ventured beyond breakfast food here."}
{"text":"The health spring juices they have are amazing I got with kale apple cucumber and lemon. Drank the who thing in minutes I highly recommend that drink. I also got the egg Benedict I forgot the name but it has mushrooms, spinach, onions, baccon crumbs with holiday sasue also came with a side of potatoes. Which was also amazing I also added a slices of ham for $5 more. 
Their service was okay nothingness exceptional that definitely was not bad.  Their you play your bill up front after the waiter drops it off at your table. Ones she sat the bill on the table we were still their finishing up our meals. Like we were forgotten about. Also your plates are every small. It's hard to cut you food because their is no room the food falls off the plate."}
{"text":"This was the first time ever coming to this place with my family and it was absolutely amazing. I would definitely recommend it! The biscuits and gravy are amazing with the Arizona Peppers hot sauce. My son had the Mickey Mouse pancakes with bananas and we all had a bite of it. The strawberry lemonade was outstanding! Plus the waitress we had was very nice!! Loves this place."}
{"text":"Very diverse menu. First time visitor and I had teh Brie and Bleu omelette. I'm not a bleu cheese fan, but this was de-lish! It was broccoli and water chestnuts in it which was very unusual. The potatoes were good as well, not greasy at all like some places. The staff was very friendly and our server got our order exactly right even though she did not write anything down. Impressive!!!

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The Good Egg has certainly lost some of their luster over the years, but they still make a great breakfast.  There usually isn't much of a wait, unless you are going on a Sunday around the time mass gets out.  The restaurant is generally clean most of the time, and service is middle of the road. One of my favorites is their Mushroom Caps and Eggs that comes with a whole side dish of sauteed mushroom caps loaded with melted cheese alongside eggs, potatoes, and an English muffin.  Very tasty!  Some of the omelette's have come to the table a bit on the greasier side before. The prices are pretty reasonable and their lunch menu is mostly as good as everything on the breakfast side. A face lift and a new updated look could do the business a lot of good."}
{"text":"This place has hands down the best healthy options EVER! This is not your typical pancake, egg and hashbrown place that only lets you sub toast for sausage. No. This place is legit alternative choices to keep your heart healthy and your body unbloated by sodium.
Why do I say this? Pancakes. 
Want whole wheat pancakes? Ok. Want whole wheat with organic flax seed, organic agave syrup, coconut, almond, and a shot of protein powder in it? OK!!!!! I kid you not, they have a mind blowing amount of options for your pancakes. At addition price, of course :).
My boyfriend got a healthy plate of fruit (nice and fresh) an egg white scramble with turkey, and a side of whole wheat pancakes (for just a dollar more!) and I got a plate full of huge buttermilk pancakes and a side of hashbrowns (cuz I'm a fatty). The hashbrowns were unfortunately not to my liking as some were over cooked to the point of being burned, and others were still raw. The pancakes, however, were pretty good.
With our room key we got a 10% discount and it all came out to 17$ before the tip."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in here for breakfast and sandwiches to go for lunch while we were on our way to Salt River. Our waitress was friendly and perky, wakening me up with her bright, cheerful smile better than the coffee (which, by the way, was acceptable). My boyfriend wanted to order two pancakes until she explained that their pancakes are 12\" in diameter. At her suggestion, he went with two petite pancakes which were still abnormally larger than your average pancakes. I got two eggs scrambled soft over hash brown and potatoes in a skillet. 

For our lunch sandwiches, my boyfriend got the Hearty Half Pounder of Angus beef patty and I asked for the California Tuna Salad. Tuna? Love it. Avocado? Love it. Cucumber? Love it. Lettuce? Love it. Grilled croissant? Definitely love it. The Hearty Beef Pounder resembled more of a filet mignon and tasted just as good. Oh, how I wish they would export the chain to New York..."}
{"text":"I tried the \"Wildcat Omelet (chorizo, black beans, corn tortillas strips, jalapeños, Pico and some type of enchilada sauce) Delicious! It comes with breakfast potatoes and two flour tortillas. Waitress was friendly and attentive and the coffee was fresh. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Old Pueblo! The service was good too. Much higher quality place to eat than the usual chains :-) recommend it highly!!!

As for what I had for my breakfast meal: Eggs over easy, potatoes, chorizo, coffee, and a small OJ. Totally yummy!!"}
{"text":"No reservations allowed.  Can't even call on the way in to get on the list.  Better get there early.

Still like the food and it is good for small parties. Just not for big groups."}
{"text":"I used to come here about once a week solid for 2 years. I obviously liked the place. It was always consistently yummy but I've found that if you plan on going, it's best to time it. Either come right before the church crowd gets out, or a couple hours after, otherwise you could be waiting for quite awhile. They have a free coffee station outside when it gets packed, so at least you can drink some hot coffee while you wait. 

I've always enjoyed the Chilaquiles (don't think they have that on the menu anymore) and the Nurse's Bialy Breakfast- 3 egg whites w/ turkey, spinach, onion, and tomato with a toasted bialy and cream cheese. I used to be fond of their fried breakfast potatoes but for me, I'm finding them too greasy and usually make my stomach hurt, even though they taste great. 

If you ask, your server will refill your drink and put it in a to-go cup when you're done with your meal. That's always cool."}
{"text":"Been going to this location of The Good Egg for about 8 years. They have the best pancakes in town IMO. In fact, we're always happy with the food.

We used to be happy with the service until a couple years ago. I don't know if they changed ownership or management or what. But it seems everyone, from the servers to the hostess to the manager, has an attitude these days. Definitely affects whether I want to go and spend my money at this place. Lately I've been going to TC Eggington's instead, which has a killer omelet!"}
{"text":"I love the food at The Good Egg. It is one of my favorite breakfast restaurants. The coffee is good and they give you a carafe at the table. The quality of the food is consistent and I love the fact that they have some healthy options. Try the oatmeal and you won't be disappointed. Even if you are not an oatmeal person, theirs is really tasty and they serve it with so many \"mix-ins\" that it is really delicious (and filling). 

The hubby and I went to this location for the first time on Saturday. We were pleasantly surprised that there was not much of a wait. Even though the place was full and there was a steady stream of patrons arriving, the staff seemed to be keeping up just fine. Much better than the nearby TC Eggington's which is always pure chaos on the weekends. I saw some of the other reviews regarding the service but what we experienced was friendly and prompt. I do know that they recently got a new general manager so that is probably the reason for the improvement. I think Jason and his team are doing a phenomenal job!

One more note about this location is that I did notice parking was a bit of a nightmare.  Lots of cars coming in and out due to the adjacent Starbucks and the fact that there was only one entrance/exit.  Apparently the restaurant has an arrangement with the hotel directly behind them (think it was a Wingate but I don't really remember) so save yourself some frustration and park there and walk over."}
