{"text":"This is a under a new ownership now. They also remodeled the shop.  Good pizza, but insensible and terrible customer service!!!! I used go there a lot before the place was bought out, but after trying it today I don't I'll ever go back. Their new remodeled design is horrendous. It makes the shop very unwelcoming. You can't see much of the kitchen anymore as they've put up a wall. Their counter top is so tall that you can only see their heads. And the employees are usually nowhere to be seen. They are in the back talking."}
{"text":"Best late night pizza on Carson! Drunk eats can't be beat, and the staff was really cool as well."}
{"text":"Very tasty. Everything we ordered was fresh and hot out the oven. Will be returning and would definitely recommend it to friends and coworkers"}
{"text":"Such a nice place! I've been there couple times, ordered slices and some appetizers... can't complain the food was delicious. Very good customer service."}
{"text":"This place is the worse pizza shop I've tried to order from! I ordered a pizza and two hours later they still never put the pizza in the oven. I called to ask them about the status of the pizza and the guys picked and this is the following conversation.  Me- hello Guy- hello is this art? Me- no this ****** Guy- oh sorry I must've called the wrong number   After that he hung up HOW COULD HE HAVE CALLED THE WRONG NUMBER IF I CALLED HIM??  I then tried to call them back to get info on my pizza that's late by 2 hours at this point. They declined my phone call 10 times in a row before  got through and when i did the guy lied about the info I gave HIM. Grub hub was super helpful though and finally got me a refund and gave me a discount on my next order.  DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE IF YOU EVER WANT TO SEE A PIZZA AND IF YOU WANT COMMPITENT SERVICE."}
{"text":"2 for 2. When I'm with my sister and her bf a few drinks and Sola pizza usually gets brought up. Definitely make a good pie. Worth a shot for sure."}
{"text":"Delivery came earlier than estimated. Hot and fresh, thicker crust than I expected for NY style but still good!"}
{"text":"AMAZING PIZZA. Would absolutely recommend. Very nice service, great food & a good time"}
{"text":"The pizza was mediocre at best. Took an hour and a half for delivery after being told 45 minutes (ordered 2 small pizzas and 2 small salads). Our sauces which were on the order didn't come. Salad was nothing to write home about, and they didn't even give us plastic forks with the salads! Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Well at least they try... A bad attempt at NY pizza. I have to say the crust is good but the cheese leaves something to be desired. It's thick, matted, and oily."}
{"text":"This is my first order from Sola and it will probably be my last. I got a large plain cheese, crust was decent and it was hot when I picked it up. However the taste wasn't good. It had way more sauce than cheese, so had a very Saucy flavor and the sauce is Bland. Even appearance wise, looked very red. Had the sauce/cheese ratio been better,  it might have tasted differently but it was not.  There's enough pizza places to order from that's better, esp for the price."}
{"text":"If you want to feel like you are in a big city, maybe have your own \"Louie\" moment like the opening to the acclaimed FX series, Pizza Sola in South Side is the place to be.   Pizza by the slice displayed on big trays, thrown back in the over when you order, so that it can finish cooking and be served hot, and the slices are HUGE!  Once you have it you can sit and the small counters by the windows and watch the headlights of the traffic go by and feel, for just a moment, that you are in a much much larger city.  This place is great. The sister shop in Shady Side (bearing the same name) has better seating, and due to the larger pizza counter, usually has a better selection, but the South Side location is awesome nonetheless.   One word of Warning- I only recommend this for getting pizza by the slice (large slices that they are) since they cost about $4 each. I once ordered a whole pizza, and it wasn't significantly larger than a normal pizza, but it cost me over $20. Just go by the slice."}
{"text":"Worst place in the Southside. Waited 25 minutes for 3 slices and Tom the staff member was extremely rude to me. I asked to cancel my order and he told me he wasn't sure what to do without a manager around. I had to ask Tom 3 times for him to give me his name before he finally said it very sarcastically then he walked away. You are better off ordering delivery than to go here."}
{"text":"Tried it, NOPE!!! Ordered a Steak Sandwich, received a   Salad Shooter sandwich instead with a thin grey meat layer of mush!!!!! Wife received Gyro, no sauce she said it was OK! (She's a Marvel Super hero -Cast Iron Stomach Woman) My son got the meat ball hero, they looked dry and mushy, he said they were OK but he didn't really sell it like he does McNuggets, he's a teenager. His fries looked disgusting like they were made a lonnnnng time ago. Wait my son doesn't look too good right now, tossed the balance of his sandwich. Sola should be NOla!"}
{"text":"Its never a good sign that when you are drunk, and the food tastes bad.  If Patrick, H is correct and this is the best pizza in Pittsburgh, this is just plain sad.  Greasy, slow and expensive. It filled the void, but that is all I'll enjoy.  I agree with the old comedy bit that pizza is like sex and even bad pizza is still good.  Consider waking up, rolling over, seeing someone there and saying OH GOD WHAT DID I DO LAST NIGHT? Yep, that's Pizza Sola."}
{"text":"Finally a decent slice of pizza in Pittsburgh!  The pizza was tasty and the staff was amazing.  A fantastic experience, I'm sure to be back again and again!"}
{"text":"I've had pizza ALL over the country, even the Big Apple...can't top these guys!   You enter the pizzeria, it's a single room, show casing about 10-12 full pizzas all sold by the slice or the whole pie. You pick your slice and its served on a paper plate if it's for-here, topped with a second paper plate if it's to-go. So simple and simply delicious!  The slices are huge, and one is enough to fill me up.  Seating is limited to two bar style areas in the window of this shop, facing busy Carson street. Get em' while you can, if your a fan of people watching. I also love to just grab food, and walk around the south side.  The staff is a very friendly group of forward-thinkers. I'm just as pleased to b.s. with the staff, as I am to get my slice! I'll always be back, as long as I'm within driving distance!"}
{"text":"My in-laws recommended this restaurant. My husband and I, though, felt a bit disappointed in the food. The pizza tasted a just-OK 3 stars. The salad was 99% iceberg lettuce and had only a few pieces of cucumber and tomato. My husband ended up going into our refrigerator and cabinet to find additional toppings for the salad. We give the salad 1 star. The Italian sandwich tasted a good 4 stars. I guess that the overall average would be about a 3."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh hands down.  Only bad part is seeing Mike and Tonys across the street.  What a hard decision to make."}
{"text":"It was a beautiful late afternoon on Carson St and I'd had an adult libation or two or three.  I had an attack of the munchies and this place was calling me.  I stopped in and was greeted by two friendly guys behind the counter and several good looking pies ready to buy by-the-slice.  First I tried the banana pepper and pepperoni variety.  It was ready quickly and was served piping hot.  The slice was big but I was a little surprised that the tab was just under $5.  It tasted just fine albeit a little greasy.  Next I tried the classic pepperoni and mushroom variety and once again it was just under $5, a little greasy and tasted fine.  I enjoyed sitting by the front window and people watching while I munched.  I come from the Philly area and of course there is lots of seriously great pizza in South Philly.  These slices were fine but could not compare to those masterpieces of Italian delight in Philly.  I feel that $5 a slice to too high but I'll give them that they fill a need if you are cruising Carson Street.  I'm going for three stars."}
{"text":"Standard New York style pizza join. Good enough to get the job done. I've had better, but I've had way way worst."}
{"text":"Didn't bring any plates, napkins or anything. Delivery driver was somewhat rude. He didn't even have to deliver it to our hotel room we walked down ourselves"}
{"text":"Great pizza for the price. The size was huge. The cheese was a Parmesan blend which is my personal favorite."}
{"text":"I was raised on pizza in NYC and, since I started visiting Pittsburgh have been looking for a reasonable facsimile.  I knew somewhere in the city there had to be a decent slice of pizza.  Had been to another well rated establishment, Mineo's, back in August and it was OK greasy pie.  Pizza Sola, however, is the closest thing to NY style pizza that I've had in the 'Burgh.  Went to the Pizza Sola in South Side today..ordered up a couple of slices and yes...it was very good.  Worth a return trip."}
{"text":"Pretty good New York style pizza.  Open late night for some drunk eats on the southside.  They only had a couple basic topping options when we stopped in around 1am on a Friday, just wish they had a little bigger selection of single slices."}
{"text":"The East Carson Street Pizza Gauntlet Part 3  Just as RJ said, we seemed to keep buildling towards something. There was an escalation of sorts at hand, if not in terms of quality but size, stature, poshness of surroundings. Zeeno's was still on top, defeating Sal's, demonstrating that a pizza needs to taste better than it looks. The unassuming Zeno's was on a tear.   So here we were, working our way down Carson, finding Pizza Sola. There are stools, hard, finished wooden counters, a young perky gal behind the counter. This was a New York pizzeria by way of Shadyside.   The pizzas behind the glass were even better looking than that ones at Sal's, more sophisticated, as if they actually read books that weren't about beauty, celebrities, or metrosexual vampires. One can have an intelligent conversation with this pizza.   I bucked the trend somewhat and went with a white pizza adorned with breaded eggplant.   It was like Sal's Pizza (large, crispy crust) but even bigger and with more flavor despite it being sauceless. This was the smarter sister, the one that rebels by going to poetry readings and book club meetings instead of house parties. She's also better looking, knows it, but isn't hung up on it. She doesn't even wear makeup. She doesn't need to.   If there is such a thing as Gourmet New York Street Pizza, this would serve as an example. The eggplant worked brilliantly as a topping as well and was a new twist for me.  I tasted RJ's standard pep pizza and Kay's plain Sicilian after they griped about the sauce tasting canned. It took a few tastes, but yeah, it came off as supplied-by-third-party-in-buckets as opposed to made-by-Nana-at-6-this-morning.   She's a brainiac, a knockout, and sees modeling as a sideline to a career in academia.  But she eats ice cream bars incessantly, leaves candy wrappers everywhere, makes a weird grunting sound when she laughs, and is obsessed with Cake Mania. She's a keeper though. Nobody's perfect.   Right now, Zeeno's and Pizza Sola are tied.    Which one will I marry? Dilemmas...I have 'em...  P.S. They also have a nice selection of  Boylan brand bottled sodas. Kay got Jamaican Ginger Beer, and it has some bite to it let me tell you! I drank Black Cherry, the dark horse of soft drinks."}
{"text":"Some pretty decent pizza on a normal night, and a great \"snack\" after a night out in the Southside.  As thin crust pizza is the ONLY kind of pizza worth eating (yes, I take flak for that), Pizza Sola offers some pretty decent options, from the typical plain and pepperoni to pizzas topped with lots of veggies and meats.  The slices are fairly generous in size as well, so one or two slices max can fill up the average stomach.  I typically just order a slice from the counter, as the quality is consistent from one style of pizza to the next.    Tip: if you are leaving the bars at 2 AM and want a whole pie, just call them around 1:45 and place your order.  You don't have to wait in line then."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic new york slice of pizza in pittsburgh. The crust is elastic and crunchy on the outside, but still more stubborn than I like. The sauce is pretty good but there will always be something about the cheeses on pizzas in pittsburgh. What's the deal? It's always a little darker and always tastes a little like bad memories from the school cafeteria \"pizza\" in middle school. After finding this place, I'm afraid to venture new territory. I went up and down murray ave sampling and being disappointed by every local place there was so I think I'll stick to p.sola for thin crust and vocelli's (they have improved) for anything with toppings.   Oh, the workers are really cool (and always helpful with directions) at the southside locations. Frightened teenagers work at the new oakland location, but the place has coat racks at your table and nice wood finish."}
{"text":"Authentic NY style pizza... Mmmm :-)"}
{"text":"Went here last night after driving home from the airport and not wanting to stop for Wendy's/McDonalds.   When we got there I was a little worried. As it was late the selection was very sparse, but the guy behind the counter assured us that they had a fresh half pepperoni/half plain pie coming out of the oven. We ordered a plain to stay and a few slices of the pepperoni to go.   The pizza was huge, hot, and delicious. I was so happy! I am reserving the 5th star for when I return and see what the selection is like earlier in the day and when they have to reheat a slice."}
{"text":"We waited for Pizza Sola, our reliable source of New York style thin crust pizza to reopen.  We were so pleased when we saw the lights on again and visited last night.  The remodeling was not what we expected: more LA liquor store than neighborhood bistro.  The menu had changed, despite its name no longer pizza sola, but other fast food offerings.  But the pizza! What a disappointment.  We expected overnight-risen hand pulled dough, thin crust bubbly around the edges, with a touch of cornmeal on the bottom, stringy cheese, just the right amount of tomato sauce and a hint of olive oil.  What we got was an awful bready, stiff (possibly premade) crust with inferior greasy cheese.  Our family of 3 did not finish the large pie and did not save the leftover slices to eat cold the next day.  In our house that's about the worst condemnation possible.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Neon lights and open signs should mean that they are willing to serve! Not at this establishment!! Please tell me or note things that cannot be done prior to a time. I'm merely wanting food, there is no need to be explicit with your language. Thank you I will NEVER come here AGAIN"}
