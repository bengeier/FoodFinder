{"text":"It's a total fluke that I stumbled upon this place, but I am super glad that I did.   This store carries a wide variety of Mediterranean groceries and when I went, it wasn't busy at all! The prices are AMAZING and their selection is impressive. They've got everything from baklava to Jordan almonds, fresh produce to halwa.  It's conveniently located in a strip mall that's got a ginormous Shopper's Drug Mart, and yes, a Tim Horton's as well.  Do some shoppin', have some java and get all the ingredients you need for that fab Mediterranean dinner, all in one stop. What could be better?"}
{"text":"We were walking off an excellent bowl of Pho and found a small store that supplied mediterranean food. Most items I have not seen any place else. Took some time to look at all of the amazing finds. I am going back for the spices, great prices on fresh vegetables and more I am sure. Omer the owner said he sources the Veg from the Medison Hat area and has been doing so for 20 years. He will sell bulk and wholesale too."}
{"text":"Well, this is a cute little Mediterranean grocery store where you can buy unusual food and ingredients.  It's located in a strip mall, and isn't all that big, but it serves its purpose all the same.  They sell a bunch of different stuff like canned goods, fresh vegetables, and even hookah pipes and coals.  This surprised me when I went in.  And, man, do they have some good prices in there!  I mean, I bought a giant bag of carrots for only $1.50, something that would cost at least $3 in a regular supermarket.  They were also selling bags of ginger for only $0.99.  I don't use ginger that much, but at that price I couldn't refuse.  Now I need to make some for dinner consisting of carrots and ginger!  I might just go out of my way to stop by here.  A regular grocery store would sell the same stuff as this place, but for much more money.  I guess you pay for the convenience of having large chains nearby."}
