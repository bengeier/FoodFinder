{"text":"OMG this place is the BOMB!!  It is tucked away in the Cotswold Village  Y2 is such a hip little place.  The Sushi is probably the best I have ever eaten.  Portions are huge.  \"Tanner Roll\" & \"Guru Roll\" are outstanding.  SUSHI CHEF LOUIS is top notch.  A true artist.  SERVICE PROFESSIONAL Hannah is also a total pro.  I was impressed  by the way she steered me through the specialty rolls and teas.  My new place for sushi.  Dine In or Carry Out.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I met two girlfriends for lunch today and the food was amazing!  After a busy morning, we were all hungry and ready to dive into the new menu!  We started with the tri-color hummus, which was unbelievably fresh, served with big carrot slices!  We also took Tanner's suggestion to share avocado fries too.  I know it sounds weird, but they are delicious!  Next we moved on to salads topped with the famous beet burger!  The beet burger is the perfect consistency and SO GOOD!  Everything was so fresh and good! I will definitely go back when I can enjoy a glass (or bottle) of wine!  Oh and the sushi looked so amazing that I ordered that to go...for dinner!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING and we were so excited to have discovered this place which is tucked behind Panera and Salsarita right beside the Yoga studio. 

They have incredible healthy menu. We ordered a panini with turkey, turkey bacon with basil aioli sauce on this amazing wheat bread. We also tried 
couple of their sushi rolls which was so fresh and DAMNED GOOD! We will definitely go back and try the beet burger which was highly recommended by our server to get next time."}
{"text":"So glad I discovered this little gem! They have a chef from Sushi Guru that makes Guru rolls or house specialty rolls. The menu offers several organic options which is great to see. Healthy smoothies, salads and wraps that are great for on the go. I will definitely be ordering take out soon from here!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Sushi Guru and had high hopes for this second location, a tad bit closer to home. (It's hard to find the first time. Tucked in the back of the Cotswold shopping center, behind Panera and Salsaritas.) Unfortunately, it's just not as good. The atmosphere is super weird, attached to a yoga studio, and the prices are way too high for the \"cafe\" concept. Speaking of, the menu is part sushi, part sandwich/salad. Again, just weird and didn't quite work for me. The sushi itself was average -- we had the ceviche app and guru roll. Next time I have a hankering for sushi, I'm going to drive past this location and trek the extra 2-3 miles to the South Park Sushi Guru!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Beautiful people and beautiful food. It's is the best sushi in Charlotte. It's got something for everyone. It's veg/vegan friendly too."}
