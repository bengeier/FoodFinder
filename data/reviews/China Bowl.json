{"text":"I've been going to China Bowl since forever. I always come and get an order of their buffalo wings. It's so delicious! Giving only three stars because the quality of the wings have gone down. They used to be so plump and lately, my wings have been tiny and over fried. Hopefully they fix this!"}
{"text":"I been here over 23 yrs in this area and the china bowl is not good at all. The people that use to have it the food was good. She doesn't understand english"}
{"text":"Place is great! Awesome value and super tasty. The babe got sweet and sour chicken and I went with the boneless spare rib. Both were great and will be out new spot for take out since we a right around the corner!"}
{"text":"Fast food Chinese restaurants are as good as their Sweet and Sour Chicken dish and I can't say I was impressed by China Bowl's.  Granted, the lunch special was a mere $5 (not including the .75 charge for using debit) but the sweet and sour chicken was tasteless.  The chicken was soggy and the disturbingly dark sauce was tasted burnt yet bland. The portions were decent however. Maybe I need to try more dishes or \"upgrade\" to non-lunch specials, but I'm definitely not ordering S & S chicken again.  Will give China Bowl another try thanks to the review of the reputable Mr. Jared Y.."}
{"text":"Three words: Hole in the wall, inexpensive,  and convenient. They give you enough food for your buck, and quite tasty as well. I suggest the sweet and sour pork, yum!!!"}
{"text":"Location, location, location.  Amongst all the tire shops and barber shops that smatter that stretch of The Plaza and next to the Food Lion is the very unassuming China Bowl.  Do not be intimidated by the neighborhood, the bright orange exterior, or the bars on the front windows, the China Bowl is a gem!  This is AMAZING Chinese takeout!  Opening for and offering lunch specials, the Bowl is open until 9pm weeknights and 9.30pm Friday and Saturday (closed Sunday).  With standard Chinese takeout fare, I was lured in for beef and broccoli and was pleasantly surprised with their wings.  Great flavor for fried chicken wings.  They also do Buffalo, Sesame and BBQ wings which I will be sure to try as well as their boneless spare ribs.  Call ahead as there really isn't any seating and it may take a few minutes for your grub to be ready."}
{"text":"Sure, everything about this place screams sketchy but the food is great, cheap and fast. China Bowl has prevented and saved me from some awful hangovers."}
{"text":"This place is not appealing on the eye at all but has some of the best Chinese food in town everything takes 15 minutes according to them I would suggest calling your order in is you will be waiting about 30 minutes no matter what you order. Even if you got an egg roll that's 30 minutes. Looks are deceiving because the food does not look like it came out of that place very tasty"}
{"text":"Nothing special at all. Tastes average. No different from any other Chinese restaurant. Standard sauces add sesame = sesame chicken... Etc etc. Wasn't sure if the chicken was really chicken!"}
{"text":"Meh. I wish this place was awesome because it is so close to my house. But it's the kind of greasy, MSG-laden cuisine that is often served as Chinese fare. Portions are good, but the food is just ok. It's takeout-only."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, minimal menu and poor customer service. I love Chinese food and live around the corner but can't go back here."}
{"text":"China Bowl is a solid bet for takeout Chinese! Their fried rice had crisp vegetables, and I really enjoyed their hot & sour soup. Their combos come with rice and an egg roll, and I think the sesame chicken combo was only $7. Definitely really good quality for the price!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 4 stars not because the food is spectacular, but it's really well priced for the quantity and the taste. You can get a really decent amount of food for like six bucks here. Quick, easy and right near the NODA area. It's a solely take out place just a forewarning.  I've had the sesame chicken, the sweet and sour and the chicken and broccoli. The chicken and broccoli is the best so far. Highly recommend that or the sesame chicken."}
{"text":"The wings are the best wings in the city! Try them plain, or extra spicy buffalo! The pork fried rice is a must too."}
