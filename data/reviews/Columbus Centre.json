{"text":"This place is so dirty , staff is very unfriendly (unless they want to sign you up) , the cleaning staff is non-existant and when they do show up they take way too many short cuts .

Machines are OLD , there is NO AIR circulation in the workout rooms, there is dust everywhere.  The changerooms:  the General membership changeroom is slightly cleaner than the more expensive membership...  too many people bringing in Food and eating at their lockers!!  Too much cheap perfume sprayed everywhere.   The sauna is too cold (they say they can't set it too high as they have a very big senior citizen membership and the seniors can't handle the sauna too hot) The whirlpool is dirty and disgusting , and most of the time it's not working.  The showers are old and the water temps go hot and cold all the time.  Hair everywhere.  REally gross.

The caffe is nice though, big screen tv, food is good , service is friendly.  The art work in the Entrance is exceptional.  

Parking is pain the lot is dirty and sometime over crowed with cars there for other events etc.. but not too bad overall.

This gym needs to be demolished and start over and into 2016."}
{"text":"Was disappointed by the food as it was not fresh and the service was very slow. Will not be recommending this place. Could not post my comment until I gave this place one star. But I wouldn't have even given it that."}
{"text":"I am a member of the Columbus Centre. I can't wait for the new building. It will still have Cafe Cinquecento. Dante Alighieri Catholic high school will move into that new building from it's original Playfair Avenue location around the corner. I love this neighbourhood. It's across from this new Treviso condos. I am planning to move near there in the near future."}
