{"text":"Great food, great service, always a pleasant greeting and a nice pot of tea. I'm always excited to go and always happy that I went. 

Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Golden Gate for several years now, and I have to say everytime I go the food is always great.  If we dine in or take out food, is hot and tasty.  Decor is a little dated, but that makes it kind of fun as well.  Portions are good sized.  Egg rolls are great, and so is the Hot and Sour soup.  My fav is the Kung Pao chicken and house fried rice.  Another thing I always look at is Maricopa County inspections.  These guys do a GREAT job of keeping kitchen clean.  Their inspections are always good."}
{"text":"We have been going here for more than 35 years. It is consistently good. I really like the Kung Pao chicken. We go about once a month. The lunch special is a very good deal. The service is quick and they are very observant keeping water glasses full. I have tried Kung Pao chicken in many places and find it to sometimes contain bone chips, fatty pieces but not at Golden Gate."}
{"text":"I've been going to Golden Gate Chinese Restaurant for 31 years. That's most of my life (at the moment of this review). It has weathered the storms and continues to be my favorite Chinese American eatery in the area. So many items are amazing, but my all-time favorite is their Mongolian Beef, which I picked up yesterday and inhaled. It's amazing. If you're low on iron, order it. Seriously. And their egg drop and hot 'n sour soup are also nice. 

The current service is extremely fast, which can be good and bad. If you're going in a group, I recommend sitting at a table rather than the booths. Meals seem to go at a better pace there. Ordering takeaway is also super fast and efficient.

It's a bit tight in terms of wheelchairs/powerchairs, but doable and worth the visit."}
{"text":"Best chinese food in Mesa. My family has brought me here since I was an infant, and I am happy to say nothing has changed, not even the atmosphere! The food is awesome, I suggest the happy platter for 2 for an amazing appeteizer, and get a mai tai while you're at it. The service is perfect, never having to wait long for a refill, and also make sure you try the mustard. It will make the hairs in your nose stand up. I love the dark atmosphere, kind of like a dive bar of chinese restaurants, but never dirty. A great neighborhood chinese restaurant, and my favorite! Think of it as something you may see in the movie Big Trouble in Little China, but with customers."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch and both left feeling really full and satisfied. 
We both ordered the lunch special (sweet & sour pork for me, shrimp with lobster sauce for him) and the portions were very generous. Lunch specials come with soup, egg rolls, rice (fried or steamed), AND chow mein. We felt like it was a pretty good deal for just $5.25 and $6.25. 
On top of that, all of our food tasted fresh, like it was JUST made...and the guy who took our order (I think he is the owner too) actually said that they had just made the soup. 
Quality of service was good as well, the ambience was decent, and the place was clean. 
I think the dinner prices are a couple dollars more expensive, but we really liked the lunch special and would recommend this place to anyone who is craving Americanized Chinese food!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the first time last Saturday, and the owner told us she just took over the business 4 days ago. I was a nervous little at first, but it's clear she's an old pro. She was very sweet, and it's clear that she wants the customers to like the food. We ordered General Tso's, Moo Shu Shrimp, and Hot and Sour Soup. I wouldn't call it the best food I've ever had, but it hits the spot when I'm craving Chinese food. The initial waitress was the owner's teenaged daughter and you can tell she's too cool for school. The owner's super nice though, she made sure to refill our water and stopped by several times to make sure everything tasted okay. I told her the General Tso's wasn't as spicy as I expected and she kindly packed some house made hot sauce for us to take home with the leftovers."}
{"text":"What has happened to this place?  A former favorite of ours is now never to be visited again.  The service was acceptable, however, the food stunk.  The food tasted as if it had been cooked in plastic!  Plastic I tell you!  The service was fine as they were good with the littles, but I was not able to get past the food having once loved this place.  Perhaps it was an off day, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Staff is amazing and food is yummy!! Prices are reasonable. Great small seating area. Best chicken fried rice!!"}
{"text":"Love this place so much! The staff is great and the overall atmosphere is the best of any Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. Very authentic and aesthetically pleasing. Oh, and the food is amazing, too!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Golden Gate off and on for about ten years ( I live in surprise so not exactly close) and the food is awesome. The service is awesome as well considering how few places you can go to wher your remembered at all. I can walk in after 6 months of not going and everyone remembers me and what I usually order. Also got to go celebrate the chinese new year there once. OH MY GOD real (REAL) chinese food not half the stuff americans order. My personal favorites are the golden gate special beef , the moo shu ( with tableside service...i mean come on who else does that, and the crab angels. The crab angels are to die for, they are so fat and plump here unlike all the other places grease filled triangles. these are little golden purses of crab so good who needs a sauce ( i mean who eats them with sauce anyways... if you need sauce for your crab angels they must be horrible .) if you call yourself a chinese food fan this is a must try!!!!"}
{"text":"I grew up in this neighborhood and Golden Gate Chinese was one of the first places I ever ate Chinese food that wasn't La Choy canned chow mein.  I am happy to see that after all these years it is still going strong.  

This restaurant makes standard Chinese food - sweet and sour pork, moo goo gai pan, etc. not any sort of new Thai or fusion or other unusual new stuff, which for me is frankly a relief.  I am willing to give them four stars just because they make a decent pressed duck which seems to be unavailable at 90 percent of the Chinese restaurants I've been to in four different states.  Golden China also makes a lot of its food, such as dumplings, egg rolls, ribs etc.  fresh on site and the difference from most other Chinese places is noticeable.  I know of a few spotty experiences over the years where something wasn't made quite right or wasn't fresh as expected (for example - they usually make the sweet sauce homemade but a couple of times they must have run out or something because we got packaged sauce with the order), but I have heard many more tales of people who drive all the way from Avon to get dumplings here. They had a fire last Christmas but have bounced back nicely. 

The sauces do tend a little towards the bland unless you order a dish specifically advertised as \"Hot\".  I still think they're very good though, and would rather have it bland than loaded with onions like I get at some other joints.

I can't comment on the wait service as we almost always get takeout to go, but the folks who provide the takeout are always friendly and helpful, and the dining room is a pleasant place for the couple of times we did eat in.  You do need to ask if you want extra condiments - they give you very little otherwise, not like some places that throw a whole fistful of soy sauce packs in. 

With the huge number of trendy restaurants in Lakewood, it's nice to see a few old favorites like Golden Gate Chinese live long and prosper.  They will continue to be my Lakewood go-to place for takeout Chinese at a good low price. I think they do deliver as well, if you need that."}
{"text":"Golden Gate Chinese is the most authentic Chinese in the valley that I have encountered. However, it's still not as authentic as I'd like it to be. I'm still searching!! 

I really enjoyed all the dishes we tried and found all to be quite flavorful. We were a little disappointed in the Szechwan Chicken as it wasn't as spicy as we hoped for. The Crab Angels on the other hand made up for it. These little guys are a flavor explosion! The Mongolian Beef, Chow Mein, and Chop Suey were really good. No leftovers to be had. :) 

The atmosphere was pretty much what I had thought it would be -seemed fitting. It didn't bother me that there were no windows. The restaurant was really clean, had spacious tables and excellent service!"}
{"text":"My Husband & I ate here tonight for first time and we're both impressed. We ordered egg foo young with chicken. They were really light &fluffy with no heavy fried taste, the sauce was right there too. The price was awesome $9.95.. can not be beat the taste or price. Beats Aimlee Chinese by far and half the price. Also had some sesame chicken, cooked to perfection. 

The only thing I would suggest to the owners is ion blinds, people drive by all the time because they think it's closed. 

Looking forward to our next visit,close to where we live and great to support a business that is worth while."}
{"text":"it was kinda stale tasting. I order sweet and sour chicken. I figured since most reviews were good, I gave it a try.

So far if you want to get your money's worth, visit KING WAH in rocky river. Very tasty and worth it."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner about an hour & 15 minutes before close & it was absolutely dead. My friend and I were the only ones there. That being said, the service was terrible, I waited about 15 minutes before I got a refill on water. The food was mediocre. Ordered the sesame chicken and I could tell it was not fresh, had a weird taste to it. The rice was cold. The only thing I managed to eat with no problem were the crab Angels. The check was brought to us immediately after our food was, made us feel rushed. Over all, just not a good experience. Would rather have spent so much money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Just did carry out. Panda Express is WAY better. Actually, Taco Bell is better."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. It's always delicious and never disappoints. The service is almost always fantastic, and they fill up your water glass constantly. I love this place and will not go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Fast and very friendly service. This place is our new go to restaurant and you can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"Waited half an hour for a pint of chicken fried rice and an order of crab Rangoon. The crab Rangoon had several shells in it. The sauces and the fried rice had no flavor. I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"Came here 30 minutes before closing. Man This place was so dirty. Huge crumbs all over the floor, dirty plates. My cousin had lipstick on her glass, dirt in my glass and on my plate. Mid way through dinner we hear this odd noise in the ceiling. I thought maybe it was something settling but it happened 3 different time. RATS MAN. It was rats. Never coming back, come here if you like dirty stuff. Oh good by the way was mediocre"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this awesome place !! Our first time was to celebrate my daughter\"s birthday. We chose the Mandarin dinner.  Everything about the meal was amazing from the tea ,appetizers, entrees and beautiful decor. They have a wonderful chef!!  We received the VIP treated as if we were the only customers. Food was fast, hot , and delicious!! The owner personally came to our table to see how satisfied we were!! We let her know we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"If you want some really delicious Chinese food, this is the place to go! The food is excellent and so is the service. We are not from this area and just happened to stumble upon this place and are we glad we did! The wait staff is very prompt and attentive and helped us pick out 2 excellent dishes because we didn't know the restaurant and didn't know what was good. Their menu also helps out by telling you what is a house specialty and what is recommended. We will definitely go again whenever we are in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I went here of the first time this weekend.  It was a bittersweet visit.  While the decor is lacking, the service is some of the best I've ever seen.  We were only 2 of 2 tables that had customers. I get the feeling that they do more take out., than sit down.

That said, the menu is very unorganized and there are few vegetarian options available (at least from what I could tell from the mishmash.  They do offer pressed duck, which is unusual.  I decided on the Govenor's chicken (spelled the way it was) since I will eat chicken and the boy friend got the moo-goo gai pan.  My diner was supposed to be is a spicy brown sauce.  It was brown....both dinners were woefully under seasoned and mine was inedible (at least the one of the large \"nuggets\" for lack of a better word. They were the size of tangerines)  I ate my rice and the server was right there, offering me a new dinner or to have mine re-made.  Since the boyfriend ate another \"nugget\" and it was fine, we decided to take it home and he would eat it.  On the upside, the veggies were cooked to perfection in both of our dishes, his with peapods, water chestnuts and mushrooms, mine on a bed of broccoli that was still bright green and quite tasty.


 When they brought the check, they also brought a refreshing half an orange cut into wedges along with the fortune cookie.  They did take a few bucks off the bill to make up for my dinner ,so that was nice.  The sweet and sour sauce is a lurid orange pink color with little flavor.   The hot mustard on the other had will take you sinuses to Pluto if you are not careful, and that is NOT a complaint! 

Oh and watch the lot.  No lines and people park willy-nilly.


All in all, I will go back and give this place one more shot.  They were nice enough and perhaps it was an off dish for me to order.  I do know that I still like Dragon Towers at Kamm's  much better."}
{"text":"One of my friends took me here after raving about their parent's passion for this place and how they have been going here year after year.  Oh my god!  This place is sooooo amazing!  The owner is so sweet as well.  It's authentic, delicious, and really reasonably priced, too.  If you even think your left overs will make it to your house (or even the 101) think again.  This place is just plain awesome!"}
{"text":"My parents have been going here for 20+ years and still this is the only Chinese they will eat in Cleveland. I live very close and frequently get take out. The Hunan beef is great, my girlfriend loves the sweet n sour chicken and crab Rangoon. 

It will not rock your socks off but it will satisfy a craving for Chinese with fast service and solid meals at a cheap price."}
{"text":"Definitly a family favorite!  We have been going here for 22 years now... Great service and staff are like family to us.  Food is delicious and affordable!  Always full and happy after Golden Gate!  :)"}
{"text":"We tried this place because of the good reviews here and we were not disappointed. The food was fresh and flavorful and inexpensive. With a modest bill we were able to fill up and have plenty leftover for weekday lunches.The staff is friendly and professional. On our first visit we were able to meet the owner and she was very personable and accommodating. This is our new go-to place for Asian food"}
{"text":"I gave this place 5 stars cause, for Arizona, this is a great Chinese restaurant. The complimentary tea is awesome. The service is always great & the food is really good(not as salty & overpriced as others in the area). Super cheap, especially at lunch! My bf & I are used to NY chinese & Arizona doesn't usually come close. The ambiance & authenticity here are just what you get in NY. Unlike the other strip mall types around the Tempe/Mesa area, this is tucked away with a lot of regulars inside(mainly older folks), but the restaurant is a real set up with very sweet decorations(not saying completely tasteful, but very sweet). The only thing that ever surprised us was mushrooms in one of our orders & it wan't on the menu. Other than that, they're nearly always on point & super nice. We prefer the beef & brocolli or the mongolian beef, but we're moving our way through the rest of the menu. We love it!   :)"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years... they have a great lunch menu, friendly service, and they get the food out fast! If you go during dinner time, try their garlic chicken wings... YUM."}
{"text":"The owners have changed the food is very good now!! Everyone is very nice I really like the dine in over take out."}
{"text":"By far the best place to find Chinese food. Egg Rolls are F'ing Great & The Duck Sauce is an original recipe! Besides they actual make authentic fried rice , not that yellow stuff you find everywhere else."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying: I'm a New York girl who loves her NY Chinese. Thick egg roles, big meaty spare ribs - you get the drift. After moving to the southwest I had to give up my two loves, real pizza and tasty Chinese...

UNTIL I DISCOVERED GOLDEN GATE CHINESE on Baseline in Mesa!

GOOD LORD! THICK egg rolls! HOT & SOUR soup with a generous amount of heat and spice. GARLIC CHICKEN THAT CAN NOT BE BEAT! And the owner, Sue, has been there for 23 years - her chef has been with her for 22 of those years. This is, far and away, the BEST CHINESE FOOD I HAVE EATEN WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI.

RUN, don't walk, to GOLDEN GATE!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time today, after living nearby for the last 13 years and never stopping in. 

I've been wanting a old-fashioned Chinese restaurant who served food family-style, but with a hubby who considers Pei Wei's Orange Peel Chicken as asian as he'll eat, I never really had the opportunity to search places out. Now that my daughter is old enough to eat at a restaurant without making a scene (you parents know what I'm talking about) I've started to venture out with her to try new places.

On the kid-friendly front, they've got a nice aquarium with some large colorful fish in them and a fountain right in the center of the restaurant. We were lucky enough to be seated right across from it. My daughter loved watching the fish while we waited.

After reading all the reviews on Yelp for this place, I decided to give it a try, and I'm SO glad I did. This place is fabulous. And their prices are very reasonable, especially for their lunch specials!

I'm on a calorie/carb restricted diet, so I'm always really careful with what I ordered. I was happily surprised to find lots of veggie/protein combos to choose from. The sauces that came on them were nice and light. I didn't feel like I was \"cheating\" by not ordering them without the sauce. 

I'm SO thrilled that I've finally found my Chinese place and will be coming back regularly! (My daughter has already demanded that it becomes our regular eat-out lunch place - which we do once a week). 

The service was prompt and responsive. Sue, I'm assuming, was roving around making sure all of the guests were happy. A few patrons called her by name, which is always a good sign. 

We will definitely be back. I'm even planning on dragging my hubby in and making him try it. I know he'll love it once he gives the place a shot!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were at the Galleria Mall (2 blocks away) until 8:15 pm on a Wednesday night until we realized that we're huuuungry.  Decided to look for a Chinese restaurant and Yelp served up this spot.  It was 8:25pm and they close at 9pm, so when we got there I made sure with the lady working if it was still ok to have a sit down dinner.  She was really friendly and welcomed us with open arms.  Since it was late, there was only one other family dining in.

We ordered the \"B\" dinner for 2 (or more like 3).  It came with soup (we chose the hot and sour soup) a small veggie egg roll and a cream cheese crispy won ton.  They were all hot and fresh with a good taste.
For our entree (you pick 2 from a list) we got the volcano shrimp and kung pao chicken/shrimp.
I thought I had overdone it choosing 2 spicy dishes, however they weren't that spicy at all.  These, too, were hot and fresh.  Even though the volcano shrimp was doused in their spicy sauce, it still retained some of the crispness.  The kung pao dish was very good except for the peanuts, which seemed to be a bit soggy.  That, too, was not as spicy as it looked.  But the rest of that dish was so good that the peanut thing made little difference.

Service/friendliness:  yay
Comfort/cleanliness: yay ('clean' and 'Chinese restaurant' are two phrases rarely used together)
Food: yay

I enjoyed this spot and will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food, clean restaurant, friendly staff! Egg roll was NOT greasy, packed fat with veggies and meat, aand delightful with or without sweet n sour sauce.  Hot and sour soup was just that- spicy hot, fairly tangy, and loaded w egg, mushrooms, and tofu. Chicken entree had crisp broccoli, bamboo shoots, tender mushrooms, and a deliciously seasoned and ample sauce.  Other than neighboring crying baby determined to throw his entire lunch on over the floor (poor waitress!), was a very nice-AND quite affordable- dining experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there the other day for lunch because of all the good reviews.  I was craving fish with black bean sauce and Stanley C. wrote a good review on this dish.  So I ordered the fish and my husband ordered the Egg Foo Young.  Let me tell you, this was the worst Chinese food I have ever had!  We're use to driving to Chinatown for our favorite Chinese dishes.  On this particular day, we weren't in the mood to drive so I looked up reviews on Yelp for a restaurant close by.  First off, it seemed like they use the same basic sauce for both dishes, with black beans in the fish dish.  Anyway, the fish they used in this dish was haddock (I asked the waiter because I couldn't believe the chewiness of the fish).  Haddock is best served deep fried (such as in McDonald's Filet o Fish).  If not cooked properly, it will become chewy.  This fish is not meant to be stir fried.  I should have asked what kind of fish they used in this dish before ordering, but I assumed that their cook (notice I didn't say \"chef\") would already know the best fish for stir fry.  OK, so on to the Egg Foo Young.  My husband thought that they were premade earlier, then frozen, because they were ice cold in the center and hot on the edges.  The sauce poured over it was hot but it was not hot enough to penetrate the center of the egg foo young. It's not like this restaurant was packed so they have to prepare their food in advance.  The only people in the restaurant when we went was my husband and I.  The place was entirely empty, except for the one guy who picked up a take out.  We only took a few bites of our meal and left.  Didn't even bother to pack the rest to go.  The waiter was nice and for this I am giving 1 star, besides, that is the minimum you can rate on Yelp."}
{"text":"Honestly first time we came here we got a service that was unacceptable they definitely sit Latin cultures on the top side white culture on the bottom you are not asked if anything is needed nor they come and check on you just to pick up your plates. But all the white folks get all the VIP I'm not racist, but I know when I'm being discriminated against. I am Latina so if you're Latino don't go there if you're white go for it because you will get VIP service. I will not be spending my dollars at this restaurant anymore. Decided to give this place a second shot nothing has changed service is still the same if your Latin."}
{"text":"We stopped by this restaurant on a trip to Las Vegas. The restaurant is mostly focused on take out and delivery, which means they don't have a lot of tables. That's actually a good thing. It has a nice intimate atmosphere, not crowded.

Because they don't have tons of tables, they focus on making good food. We ordered the Orange Chicken, Wor Wonton Soup, and Egg Foo Young, which they make fresh, unlike other restaurants.

I definitely recommend Golden Gate if you're looking for good, fresh Chinese food, either for delivery or to sit down."}
{"text":"Our third time here at Golden Gate - staff is attentive and pleasant and the food is quick, good and plenty! We've been here for lunch and dinner, and have gotten take out as well. My husband and family are from the San Francisco Bay Area and super picky about their Chinese food and they love it too!! Definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food is good and reasonably priced but the friendly owner and staff makes the experience. She remembers details about our lives even when we haven't been in for months. It's a great family atmosphere. A great traditional Chinese food restaurant."}
{"text":"AMAZING hole in the wall kind of place, my family's been coming here since my parents dated in high school, and to this day we still drive 40 minutes to our favorite restaurant. Incredibly kind staff, amazing food, great prices, and the best Chinese food in the valley. My personal favorite dishes are the lemon chicken, Mongolian beef, and hot and sour soup. When you go for dinner, they give you a plate of appetizers with a flame at the top so you can cook your own food, and there is a teapot with teacups on the table for lunch and dinner. After dinner, the staff brings out fried bananas with powdered sugar to your table. All of this is free!

Make sure to come here, it is an unappreciated but incredible restaurant!"}
{"text":"Not like it used to be.  I used to come here all the time about 6 years ago.  I always got the Golden Gate Special Beef, which was a huge pile of beef in a thick red sauce, sprinkled with candy-coated walnuts.  I decided to get that again and was disappointed to find a small plate of soggy fried beef in a watery sauce with a few plain walnuts.  My dining companion had the garlic chicken and it was a little slimy.  The crab angels tasted fishy and the pot stickers were more wrapper than filling, so everything was a disappointment.  It definitely isn't as good and it's far more expensive than I remember it.  Too bad."}
{"text":"We have been customers for years and including take out. Never ever have we had a wrong order! Always so delicious and dependable! This place is the real deal!!! Outstanding in every way always."}
{"text":"We ordered this for pick-up
first off, the lady that works here is the nicest ever.....however......we ordered the following:
Veggie egg roll-pretty sure these are the frozen ones from trader joes
Combo chow mein-chicken slimy, beef wierd, shrimp inedible-were afraid of getting sick
White rice-at least from day before, possibly 2 days old
Crab Rangoon-overcooked, no crab, minimal cream cheese- wierd at best
Scallion pancake-flat, dense, completely flavorless in every way
Crispy orange chicken- ok flavor, lots of inedible orange peel, broccoli? Half yellow=old
Overall the service was excellent. The food was honestly the worst Chinese food I have ever had no questions asked. The owner are awesome but the food failed on every level, we threw most of it in the trash.......and when I ordered this online our total was 28.05 and when my wife picked it up our total was 30.35......wtf?"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this locatin for so long. Depending on time I eat there or call in and pick up. My last trip was eat-in and I decided to try something different. I order the chicken pad thai and it was HORRIBLE!  Tasted like a plate of noodles dipped in fish sauce and nothing else. I should have stuck with what I know and like. I suggest anyone should try this place at least once. Their Wonton soup is delicious. The service is not so great...the owner is mean. Good Luck!"}
{"text":"I visited this place over and over again it just doesn't get old we ordered shrimp and vegetables for the adults, sesame chicken for the children. The meals are very generous and full of taste. We will keep coming back even if is way out of our way."}
{"text":"Great full service- traditional Chinese restaurant, I say traditional because it reminded me of restaurants from my childhood. 

Food is priced right, portions are ample, and tasty."}
{"text":"UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT


Now that this amazing restaurant is under new management there is a world of a difference. The service is amazing and don't get me started on the food. I've never been to a Chinese Restaurant that I enjoy this much. The food makes it feel like you died and went to heaven. My week is not complete until I have visited Golden Gate.

The food is always fresh and that's hard to find in competing restaurants. I'm used to having chewy meat and limp vegetables but, at the Golden Gate the meat is tender and the vegetables are filled with life. The popcorn shrimp has a crispy crust and fresh shrimp perfectly seasoned inside. Their egg foo young, comes with 3 pancakes and a to die for sauce, is the best I ever had and might I say that their black pepper steak melts in your mouth. I definitely recommend all the dishes they have on their menu.

The service is amazing. The owner is very sweet and she knows what she is doing. If i was ever to look for some amazing Chinese food I would go to her. The waitress is her teenage daughter, and when I normally think of teenagers I picture brats with a lot of sass. She is just as sweet as her mother and they make you feel welcomed. 

The restaurant is kept very clean and I am impressed with the high standards they hold themselves to. 

I recommend Golden Gate to anyone and everyone who loves Chinese food as much as I do. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a long time for the happy platter. Food is always good and fairly priced. Will be back again soon I'm sure."}
{"text":"This has been a favorite lunch spot of mine for over ten years.  The food is always excellent, service is prompt, and it is a good value.  I mostly just order the generic items, kung pao chicken, twiced cooked pork, and garlic chicken so I can't review the rest of the menu.  Their hot sour soup is the standard by which I judge all other Chinese places.

At lunch I've rarely had to wait for a seat but the place is almost always at least half full -- just right.

The owner is friendly and so are the servers; many of them have been there the whole time I've been going.

The dark lighting (no windows) seems a little odd at first but it ends up making it a comfortable little hideout for a relaxing lunch break."}
{"text":"I've been going to GG for decades and I have always enjoyed the place. Of course, why would I return if I didn't like it. 

I stopped by today for lunch before heading to downtown Mesa. I live about 6 miles away from GG and it is definitely not on my way to downtown Mesa--so it meant going out of my way to get there.

I've eaten here many times by myself when I am out running errands. I walked in today and stood at the entrance, and I stood and stood. A hostess was not present and a busgirl(?) passed by me twice without looking my way or acknowledging me. She was going around with a pitcher of water. I can understand that she might not know English, but she should at least know how to say hello or \"Someone will be with you in a moment.\" 

She didn't go to back to get someone or acknowledge me. I just felt invisible. Diners were looking at me just standing by the hostess counter for quite a while. 

Finally, someone came out from the back carrying soup and an eggroll for a table. As she passed me, on her way to a table, she asked, \"Takeout?\" I said no and waited for her to come back. She then asked again, \"Takeout or eat in?\" I said eat in and she led to me table. 

I don't know why, but the whole experience put me in a bad mood. I was just turned off to being there. I guess I was viewing it as a treat to have a leisurely lunch before running errands. I placed my order, and the soup and egg roll were delivered, but I just sat there. I finally just got up and left. 

This was around 2 pm. Usually Sue is there and I am greeted immediately by either Sue or someone else. But I felt ignored and put upon today. I felt like I was imposing on them rather than feeling welcomed. 

I will go back, and will just think of this as bad timing--passed the lunch rush and served by someone I had never seen there before. This woman definitely did not make me feel welcomed."}

It was a small place, only a few tables (of which I must have picked the wrong one), but clean and quiet -- the perfect place for a quick break while running errands, all conveniently on the corner of Warm Springs and Arroyo Grande.

I went to my absolute favorite dish, Pineapple Fried Rice. It usually combines the sweet with the savory with the spicy perfectly. But this place just didn't hack it.

First, I had to ask what kind of meat came in it. Almost everywhere I've been has had either chicken, pork, beef, or something mixed in. Then he told me it was just the pineapple and the fried rice, but he said I could order some meat with it, so I got some beef added in. Again, odd, but not too off-putting.

The portion was nice and big... and pretty plain. It was just pineapple, egg, and a tiny bit of green onion on top. Don't most fried rices come with more veggies? At the very least some carrots and peas, right? Not this one. And it was pretty bland. I was kind of disappointed. It wasn't BAD, per se, but it left a lot to be desired.

I don't know how the rest of the dishes are, so maybe I just caught them on an off-day, but I don't know if I'll ever be back to find out."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, attentive waiters, food comes out fast. We enjoyed it, but wouldn't say it is \"the best\". We had shrimp chow mein, fried dumplings (potstickers), hot & sour soup and Golden Gate shrimp with white rice. The shrimp were large, but not exceptionally flavorful. Overall the meal was fine, no real complaints, but no real high marks either. A nice, slightly better than average, Chinese meal; their take out business was very brisk early on a Saturday evening. If I could give 1/2 stars, I'd say 3 1/2."}
{"text":"Old school Chinese food.  served with complimentary hot tea and crispy wontons. Excellent customer service.  Great food..."}
{"text":"This place was decent until I saw them on Dirty Dining. Yes, they got demerits from the health department for not being very clean. I won't be back. I don't believe in giving these places a second chance because after the health department goes away they'll be back to their unclean ways in time. It's too bad, though, because I really liked their mixed won ton soup. Now, no telling where they chopped the vegetables...on top of the garage can?? My health is more important!"}
{"text":"The fancy is in the food!  This by far was the second best chinese food I have had (other place was in China Town in San Fran).  I ordered the Sesame Chicken and it was just the right flavor, and crispy and not doughy.  Very nice quality food."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh food, classy ambience, and fantastic service. A very satisfying dining experience!"}
{"text":"The only place that seems to be open in Lakewood on a Sunday night after 9pm!

I drive by this place every day to and from work and finally I made it there to check it out! This place has a small menu but the food is delicious! It only took 10 minutes to have my food ready. The beef is delicious as well as the pan fried dumplings."}
{"text":"Our first time visiting here and we were not disappointed. Food great, service wonderful. This is definitely our \"go to\" restaurant for Chinese food. Wait staff is clean, efficient and gracious. something you don't find very often in today's eateries."}
{"text":"Cute little Chinese restaurant.  Get packed at lunch time.  Great lunch specials.  Good price for a big lunch.  When you get in its all dim and you have to get get used to the lighting.  When you open the front door to leave restaurant you get blinded by the sunlight.  Love coming back for lunch for the price."}
{"text":"Started with the egg flower soup and it was honestly the best I've ever had. Ordered the imperial combo dinner. The egg roll, crab angel and fried shrimp were all part of the appetizer (single pieces) and all were wonderful. I had the Mongolian Beef as an entree and it was very good as well. The amount of food I received go $13.95 was overwhelming. A huge bowl of fried rice came with the entree and the service was perfect. The ladies were always checking in on me and dinner was served up very quickly. I was pretty much full after the appetizer so I had a lot to take home. 
I highly recommend Golden Gate. One of the best Chinese Food restaurants I've experienced."}
{"text":"Ok folks, I think we have a winner!  If you've read my other reviews, you would know that I've been on the hunt for a good Chinese restaurant since I moved to AZ from NY.  Golden Gate has a beautiful decor.  The owner Sue is so elegant and charming.  She's been in business for 24 years and very proud of that fact.  Can you blame her?  The options are plentiful.  This place is really a \"have it your way\" establishment.  You can substitute tofu instead of meat for virtually any dish and can substitute veggie fried rice instead of white for 50 cents.  A little pricey, but the food is fresh and they give plenty of it.   I have enough for leftovers.  I was able to add broccoli to my meal and they actually know how to fry tofu correctly!   They even slipped in a nice little bag of crispy wonton chips!  Thanks Yelpers for helping me find this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Great prices! Large quantities of food! And a very nice man that helped me each time I went! Definitely our new Chinese food spot!"}
{"text":"I go to eat Chinese food here at least once a year even though its far from my house. I like the quaint feel of the restaurant and the service and taste if the food is wonderful."}
{"text":"This is seriously one of my favorite Chinese restaurants. We typically go for the incredible lunch specials but most recently went for dinner. Still delicious but you just can't beat how good of a deal lunch is!!

Family favorites include crab Angels, wonton soup, beef with broccoli, almond chicken, orange chicken and the egg rolls! Can't forget to sip on the Jasmine tea provided as well! So good!!

It's a classic staple and the owner is always there and so sweet!"}
{"text":"I love this place.

The food is the greatest, the service is always great and there's just something about the place that makes it feel like you're at a family friend's. 

Go here. If nothing else to see the tweens breaking their backs trying to carry their oversized bass guitars into the nearby music lessons studio. There's also a massage parlor that's always open a few doors down. I'd imagine it's not a very classy establishment. 

Regardless, try the crab angels with the beef with peppers."}
{"text":"I've been here twice--First time was dine in and a mediocre experience. Lunchtime and no one was there. Second time was takeout. Person at the front counter wasn't very friendly, then actually compared my signature on my credit card to the receipt and questioned it. What?! Then one of the things we ordered was incorrect. Subgum instead of chow mein. I didn't even bother calling to complain--I just won't go back."}
{"text":"Place is horrible... Service was terrible and everyone was downright rude. This place also is dirty, complete filth- it looks like it has been there since the '70's... I don't understand how everyone was giving such rave reviews... The Board of Health needs to make a stop in here... The food was in edible..."}
{"text":"Haven't had GG in a while but it did not disappoint my taste buds. Still love terkayai chicken stocked.  Only problem the bathroom needs a over haul in cleaning!! Unable to use!!"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this place for years. Great chinese food. The food is always better if you go for dinner. Dining in is waaay better than take out and lunch time. For dinner they bring out fresh fried wontons and for dessert you get fried banana wontons and fortune cookies. Brings back childhood memories :)
We always order the golden gate fish which is fried pieces of fish in a sweet sauce with toasted walnuts. It's very good, better than the shrimp version. The szechuan chicken is really good too. If you like it spicy make sure you specify that when you order. I always need chilli oil on the side. But the food is very good, I keep going back. 
Service can be slow, so if you get a hold of the waitress tell her everything you want at once, cuz you don't know when she will be back :P But the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"It's great to walk into a restaurant recommended by Yelpers and get the feeling that it is going to be a good meal.  Traditional chinese decor without being gaudy.  Quickly treated to free tea and  served crispy, fresh, non-greasy noodles.  How attentive!  Even the table has the traditional condiments right on it (soy sauce, real-hot mustard, duck sauce).  Nowadays you have to ask for these as restaurants are cutting down, and the mustard is not the great strong Chinese mustard--it is a watered down type.  Ordered soups: egg drop which had bits of chicken in it and wonton.  The egg drop was very good and the broth of the wonton soup was delicious--the wontons lacked meat inside or at least one of the wonton did not have meat but for $2.25 each I cannot complain about a thing! 
Ordered Schezehan chicken,chicken fried rice and shrimp with lobster sauce.  I wanted to try the shrimp with lobster sauce after the fiasco I experienced at Qwik Chinese Bistro in Scottsdale.  You can read the details in that review.  This one did not let me down.  12 large shrimp in a nice, non-sweet sauce with water chestnuts.  Lovely and delicious.  Made me forget about the prior fiasco.  The chicken fried rice was a large, delicious plate of a multi-ingredient rice. Wow, and they added bean sprouts which i think really makes it even better.  The Schezuhan chicken was made without breading and spicy just as he ordered it.  What a great meal this was.  With our check came the typical fortune cookies AND as a bonus, wontons filled with mashed bananas with powered sugar.  These were better than you might expect.  Such a simple treat and yet so delicious.  They didn't have to do this but they did.  The service was spot-on without being overbearing.  I had to bag up the shrimp and lobster sauce that's how large the portion was.
BTW, pricing is very reasonable and the service was impeccable.  
Thanks to all at GOLDEN GATE who made this delicious meal possible!"}
{"text":"Well...I have had this before and it was GREAT! I don't know if they have a new staff or what but I literally HATED the $30 worth of food I bought for dinner yesterday 12/15/2016 for my family. My daughter had sesame chicken...looked great! The broccoli looked perfectly steamed...when she bit into the broccoli she said it \"Tasted like how a nursing home smells\" I allowed her to throw it away. When she tasted the sesame chicken she said it tasted like \"nasty old sugar\" I tasted her chicken and I agreed...she also had to heat it up in the microwave...WHY??? when I had waited inside the restaurant for it to be \"freshly cooked\" for over 15 minutes!! Now, on to my food...I had the shrimp egg foo young...good GAWD ALMIGHTY! It tasted super fishy and so did my egg roll (I'm thinking they must have had a bad batch of shrimp)...the sweet dipping sauce was HORRIBLE too...tasted like someone had poured perfume in the mixture and it ALL left bad tastes in our mouths. I was too outdone to give them a call to complain because I remembered the woman at the front desk that took my order had what appeared to be a stank ass attitude...I wonder why she was acting like this?...I wonder what's going on in the kitchen....oh well...I'll never know because I can GUARANTEE you I will never patronize that location ever again. I would have given 0 STARS...but that isn't an option on here. Oh, I can't review my husband's food because he works 2nd shift and I haven't heard his complaints yet. Save your money people and head to CHINA GATE at Cedar Center in University Heights...THEEE BEST AUTHENTIC CHINESE FOOD IN OHIO. Maybe the people at Golden Gate should take a journey up there and get a dayum clue."}
{"text":"Service was great at lunch time! Food was mediocre..the meat was shiny and thin. Not great quality meat.Everyone has different style and taste. I would return and try something like soup.The restaurant is dated but I enjoyed it !"}
{"text":"I grew up in an area with a high Asian population, so I'm spoiled when it comes to Chinese food. This place makes great food. Although it doesn't look like much from the outside, it's actually very nice inside. They even have an aquarium. It looks and feels authentic, although I guess I technically am not qualified to say that it is. The owners are very nice and the servers are happy to help and accomodate. I just love eating there - the atmosphere is very relaxing and the food and tea are comforting."}
{"text":"We stopped in for takeout - beef and snow peas, shrimp with vegetables, and chicken fried rice. The beef was a knockout - tender slices of beef and perfectly cooked snow peas. I loved the shrimp as well, although it was a darker sauce rather than the white sauce I expected for shrimp. Sadly, the chicken fried rice wasn't up to par - gristle on the chicken and dried-out peas and carrots (I wish restaurants wouldn't resort to this shortcut with fried rice; a little fresh onion and bean sprouts would be much better). I'll go back for lunch on my own, but chicken fried rice is my husband's go-to order, so a place won't wind up in our regular rotation unless they nail it. Bummer, because the rest was great!"}
{"text":"Okay. First off, I've been going here since the mid to late 80's. It's a long standing, proven Chinese Restaurant. It's years serving good food is telling enough to it's quality. Is it the best in the world? No. But it sure is darned close! I've never had a bad meal here. Their complimentary hot tea and crispy won tons with sweet & sour are always the perfect appetizer. Add some hot mustard for spice ;-)

The staff are always courteous and make sure you are well taken care of as soon as you walk in the door. Tsing-Tao? YES PLEASE!

I have a little secret for you - Order their Garlic Beef. This is the only restaurant in the valley (that I know of) that actually sells it! It is PHENOMENAL!  Tangy, saucy, garlicy beef that melts in your mouth. Your entrees come with a container of steamed rice that add just the right touch of Asian flair.

Don't listen to the haters out there, this is a really great place for old school Chinese food. If you aren't in the mood for the trendy overpriced nonsense of \"other\" restaurants, go visit Golden Gate! YOU WON'T BE SORRY!

Oh, at the end of it all? Crispy fried won tons with a banana center and powered sugar! YAY!!

Get out there and check out Golden Gate!"}
{"text":"Wow!...I'm going back!  I was a waiter in a Chinese owned and operated restaurant in college, and I lived in Asia for a year, AND, visited both China & Hong Kong, so I KNOW authentic Chinese food.  This place is the real thing.  Not to mention great friendly service, and their water is definitely not tap water...It tastes great.  I love these 'mom & pop' family-owned businesses.  You just know you are going to get great food when the place is not much to look at from the inside or the outside, which means the ONLY reason they are still in business is really good food & service!  I was surprised they were pretty busy for a Monday night, with several take-out orders.  It is hard to fine a Chinese place that is open 7 days a week, and particularly on Mondays.  If you don't like this place, you don't know REAL Chinese food, so just go back to your chain China Gate & Pei Wei crap! LOL"}
{"text":"best Chinese food in the valley. I pretty much don't go anywhere else.

I don't really understand what that other reviewer's problem is with the lack of windows? it's not like the place is a dungeon. it's a somewhat dim, peaceful restaurant.

Golden Gate special shrimp with walnuts is one of the most delicious things to eat, ever. their hot & sour soup is bomb. and their fried rice is delightful & not overly, disgustingly greasy. this place is so much better than the myriad of stupid \"Chinese\" chain restaurants or nasty take-out type places. for realz."}
{"text":"Don't pay attention to any of the negative and critical reviews.

I have been eating at this restaurant for 20 years. First, they seat you, bring tea and  chips (sauce for the chips are already at your table when you are seated). My mom and I love their fried dumplings and crab puffs. Add red chili sauce. Delicious!! Try this restaurant, you won't be disappointed. My favorite dish is the garlic chicken with their amazing sauce and fried rice! Their fried rice is top notch! The food is absolutely delicious! Best Chinese food in Arizona!

The owner of the restaurant is very nice and welcoming! We have known her for years. They place white butcher paper on top of the table cloth because of spills and to protect the table cloth. 

The decorating of the restaurant does need to be updated, however, it still has its charm. Booths are pretty low for those who are in the tall club. Nevertheless, my family and I enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I can't seem to find a good Chinese place anywhere in Henderson! The restaurant was clean, and the staff was super friendly, and I even got a free drink while I waited for my take-out. But unfortunately, the food wasn't that good. My pork fried rice was mushy and bland. The spring rolls were really greasy and had no flavor. The pepper steak was alright- definitely had fresh ingredients, big chunks of onion and bell peppers. But it too was devoid of any real flavor. If I could rate just the service though, it was exceptional!"}
{"text":"Eat here! Get the crunchy orange chicken. The food was fresh and very good. Lunch prices are reasonable and comes with choice of soup AND choice of rice, plus an egg roll. All of it was wonderful. Staff is friendly and the place was clean."}
{"text":"So if you looked up \"Chinese Restaurant\" in your Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, the picture that would pop up along with the description would probably be this place. Standard Chinese place with all of the usual suspects that your grandma would expect from such a place. Heck even Vogons would have loved this place if it weren't for that stupid hyperspace express route. But back to the restaurant - looks like kind of Chinese restaurant my parents would have taken to me back when it wasn't one of many choices but THE Chinese restaurant in that part of town where everybody in that area went to get their Chinese fix. Back when asking someone if they preferred Hunan to Szechwan would get you a response like \"what'd you call me?\" So my usual dining companions decided on this place when we tried to go to Beavers Choice but they were closed for lunch due to some odd circumstances. Place is in a mall right near the 101 and has plenty of parking. We entered and were seated right away. Looked like the lunch specials were the thing to go with so we each got our own lunch combo. I got the sweet and sour pork and it came with an eggroll and egg flower soup and also some white rice. Meal was decent and filling - the type I would expect from a place like this. The layout is a little weird - we were seated in a raised area. If you want to get up to use the restroom, you have to cross tiny walkways which also act like delivery express lanes with servers carrying plates back and forth so it ends up being like a game of Frogger - you gotta cross quickly and at the right time. Good times. Price - it was very cheap for what you get - like the prices got stuck in another decade - so my coworkers want to come back here again. Myself, not as enthused as I felt there wasn't anything really that special about the place or the food. Of course, my coworkers were also entertained by our neighbors at the next table whose conversation overpowered ours. Several old gals who talked about past husbands sparing little detail - what little we heard was enough to make my coworkers want to introduce themselves so they could hear more at a future date. I had to drag them away back to work. Would come back if in the area and out of other options and if my coworkers really start working on their script for Fifty Shades Of Grey-haired Bastards."}
{"text":"Me and my bf stopped here for a somewhat late lunch. I love the fact that they give you free hot tea and ice water, but the water is in small glasses which since my bf was incredibly thirsty he gulped down 3 glasses and he complained about the size of them. (-1)
Service wasn't as friendly as China Village on Indian school and 28th but the food was still good. They gave us a whole bowl filled with fried rice for lunch (the container that has the white rice that you get for dinner) it was good but a bit too much.

 They don't have the combo plates that other places have. They give you the lunch deal in 3 phases: soup then appetizers and then the entree that comes on a separate plate that you have to scoop out yourself (-1)"}
{"text":"Went here for New Years dinner. It was amazing! Even though it was so busy.  Great food, and awesome service! Ordered the Happy Plate apatizer, which was great. Nice variation. Fried rice and chow  mien was perfect! Definitely order the house, comes with chicken, beef, and shrimp. Had limited wine availability, but that was the only con. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I am from the East Coast and this is the closest to what we get back East for excellent Chinese Food!  Every other place I tried since moving here was horrible!  Staff is super friendly and after going here only for a few weeks begins to recognize you!  It has become a weekly outing!"}
{"text":"This was my first Chinese restaurant that I tried in the area.  I came for the lunch special and had the orange chicken.  While it was good, I felt that the portion was very small for the price and I left still feeling hungry."}
{"text":"Great homemade dumplings! Otherwise, I'd say good food. The dumplings (and the wonderful staff) are the stars."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, although at first I was alittle worried because of the location and the inside of the restaurant was dim, but it suited the theme well.  When you first walk in there is a lot of red colors and dim lighting, it is a great place to bring your loved ones.  Immediatly your eyes will go to the giant fish tank to the left of the walk way which is always fun.

When we first got seated we were served hot tea and wontons with sweet and sour sauce, I had the orange chicken and it came with an egg roll and soup of your choice, I chose the hot and sour soup.  I thought that it was all delicious, but my favorite was the hot and sour soup, it tasted alittle vinegary but I really liked the crunchy bamboo shoots.

The service was great the owner was walking around talking to all of the customers making sure that all of our food tasted good.  Another great thing about the service is that the food got to us super fast.  I would definetly recommend this place to all of my friends and family!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place four stars because the people who own it are the sweetest people I've ever encountered in a Chinese restaurant.
Extremely friendly and knowledgable.
China tango is definitely better for what I order but if this was my only option I would go back again and try something different.
Ready in about 10 minutes which was nice!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little restaurant that I will always come back to! The service is always great and Sue the owner is wonderful!!! 

The food is delicious and the portions are decent sized. You get a complimentary kettle of hot tea and chips when you get seated, and they are both so good! 

The Phoenix dragon soup is AMAZINGGGG! (as I'm writing this I'm wishing I could have some)

There are many foods to choose from (chicken, duck, seafood, beef) and prices are reasonable! Definitely give this place a try if you are in the area and are wanting great food!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite go-to Chinese restaurant! I love the complimentary tea, always delicious. Lunch deals are very affordable and delicious. Any entree comes with an egg roll and soup for under ten dollars. The dinner specials are good as well. I have never had a negative experience here! Service is also ALWAYS the best. The decor may seem dated, but the quality is on point."}
{"text":"Lunch.   Clean restroom, which is always a good sign at a restaurant.  Hot Tea was fresh.  Spicy pork was not to spicy but just right. Portions are perfect size for lunchtime price.  The owner Sue is super friendly and cute.  1st time customer.   Will be back."}
{"text":"The place is old but clearly has maintained an enduring spirit of excellence,  especially based on the history behind some of these reviews. 

First time here. It's a cold day so I was going to order hot tea, only to be surprised with a complimentary pot brought out along with water! Yeah baby. My hubz liked the free chips too, but I saved my room for the good stuff :)

So then we ordered 2 cups of hot and sour soup which was fantastic. Really warms you from the inside, and it had a nice after-kick (without kicking your ass). Also got the fried wontons- they weren't served with cream cheese filling so as a personal preference I might skip next time. However,  if you like a little chicken or beef filling, these have your name on 'em!

We shared the chicken curry. Loved the layers of spices and flavors in there, and the sauce was generously portioned, too. Chicken, bell peppers, onions, peas and carrots came along as the accompaniment to the sauce and the whole combo together was a win.

Our waters were never empty. We're both camels so that's impressive.

All these reviews that whine how outdated or dirty this place is are completely off. The decor strikes me as more vintage than \"dated\", and I didn't see anything that indicated this place is not kept clean. Haters gonna hate.

But I loved it! 
PS- also, a great value for your buck here. Prices were great"}
{"text":"The food here is really good and reasonably priced. This is definitely one of our favorite restaurants in the neighborhood. If you like spicy food, ask for the hot chili sauce to add to your food. We always get a few happy platters to split .  They give you hot tea that's also pretty tasty. -I always get the hot and sour soup to start and the pork egg foo yung (PERFECT here... Some places Definitely do it wrong)!
The ambiance is nice and the service is good- they're really friendly and since it is not too big, it is kind of home-y in a way!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are obsessed with Golden Gate!

We have lived in the Tempe-Chandler area forever and had never tried it until this last November.  The atmosphere is your typical Chinese Restaurant complete with authentic decor and a giant fish tank.  We love the hot tea and the meals that are meant to split.  Everything we tried was tasty and had us very satisfied!

The owner is so sweet and friendly.  On our second trip for dinner, she came over and introduced herself to us.  She shared her story with us and just gave us more reason to want to come back again and again."}
{"text":"I read the reviews on Yelp after driving by on my way home.  I don't like fast food Chinese or Mexican.  The reviews looked great so we decided to give it a try about 3 weeks ago on a Saturday at about 6p.m.  There was no one there and a note on the door closed for emergency.  Seemed odd but being a family business we figured that no back up staff which is silly when in business especially restaurant business.  Last week we decided to give another chance and stopped there on a Friday evening.  Same thing closed but no sign indicating closed.
Not sure what happened but all the furniture is there but closed during regular hours.  Bummer because we need good Chinese."}
{"text":"We went here the other day because my fiancee used to go all the time with her dad when she was a kid. She hadn't been back in 15 years or so. Apparently, it's exactly the same, and the food was still pretty good. The servers were friendly, the food came out fast, and there seemed to be a lot of \"regulars\" in attendance.

It's pretty standard Chinese food, but a nice, intimate atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great and amazing Chinese Food! It's under new ownership now and the owners are super nice and friendly. I recommend the Chinese popcorn chicken and the black pepper steak!"}
{"text":"i'll admit it: i've gotten old. i hate going out on NYE. i hate dealing with the drunk masses that inevitably have popped collars and think Pabst Blue Ribbon is the bombdiggity. sure, i could solve that problem by going to a friend's place to party, but then i have to drive home and let's face it, i like to get my drink on. driving home just blows. so, we have a nye tradition (in its second year) of staying home, eating chinese food, drinking, and watching movies. it works out pretty well except for the fact that we hadn't found a great chinese food place yet.

enter Golden Gate Chinese restaurant. i had driven by this place almost every day since i moved here in December 09 and always wondered what kind of restaurant didn't have windows. i'm serious. the entire building = windowless. it looked more like a money laundering operation than it did a chinese food place. since we really had exhausted our chinese options around the area, we figured we might as well try Golden Gate for new years. hell, if it was horrible, we could always have frozen pizza. 

much to our surprise, we found that Golden Gate was freaking fantastic. we ordered the crab angels (crab wontons), mushu pork, veggie friend rice, and honey walnut shrimp. this stuff was like crack! i think we demolished everything. the honey walnut shrimp was a perfect combo of sweet honey and crispy walnuts. they didnt drown the shrimpies which was much appreciated. the crab angels kicked ass. you know how when you order crab wontons at places and they give you a metric ass ton of wonton and a tiny dab of crap in the middle? not this place. they were like sacks (crunchy, tasty sacks) FILLED with crabby cream cheesy deliciousness. the veggie fried rice was perfect and the mushu pork rocked. they didnt put the plum sauce in it and left it on the side so you could add as much as you wanted. 

no, they dont have delivery but the food is definitely worth the effort of take out or dine in. i might even have to try dining without windows sometime :)"}
{"text":"I love the food here but the service, sucks! My husband and I went the other day and ordered our usual. The potstickers which we know take a long time took 45 mins to come out!! That is ridiculous! At the 30 minute mark when we asked about them it was as if we bothered the waitress. She came back and said sarcastically 5 mins. Yeah, it was another 15 minutes! The food is 5 stars but the service is 0-1 stars! We'll get our food to go from now on!"}
{"text":"Found this place on a whim. Amazing food and decent prices. Even our kid loved this place."}
{"text":"We have been going here for years. Great food! Fantasic lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Sue still remembers us (as do her wonderful waitresses!) And the food was better than the last time we ate here too. I still recommend the Golden Gate Beef. My husband had their Kung Pao and was in heaven."}
{"text":"Do not let the exterior fool you! Once you walk in you are greeted with a scenery of nice table settings! It was the first time eating here and I was impressed.  My mother uses a walker and after being seated the waitress made sure to help me stow it away but keep it accessible in case it was needed while eating dinner.  We ordered  a Happy Platter (which made us very happy), chicken chop suey,  beef chop suey,  sweet and sour pork and garlic chicken.  The portions were so big, we ended up sharing among 4 people and still had leftovers. The chop sueys was quite tasty! The egg rolls and chicken wings in the happy platter were on point! (I definitely want to go back for the wings!) additionally, they were able to accommodate due to food allergies. The waitresses were very efficient and friendly. In fact,  when they found out it was my dad's birthday,  they came out with a cupcake and sang Happy Birthday.  (we were all surprised ) I would definitely recommend this place if you happen to be in the east valley or if you just feel like having a nice sit down dinner than your average Chinese takeout. Oh, they also have cocktails!"}
{"text":"can i give 6 stars?

reheated leftovers last night and they were delicious. not at all weird like leftovers can get.  AND i was full when we left the restaurant with our leftovers, i didn't think i brought that much home...i was full again last night. i am so happy with this place!

i will probably want to go here again this saturday night!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner for the first time.. we were greated by Sue who must be the owner since she says she has worked every day for 28 years. She told us that she has all the answers! Started with hot tea and fried wonton (included!) And since it was our first time...crab puffs on the house!! Yum. So we ordered house beef and a shrimp dish. All was amazing and this is a must go to place! Photos added!"}
{"text":"This is the only Chinese restaurant I dine at. I have been going to Golden Gate for over 15 years, and in that time I have always had top notch service and terrific food. The prices are extremely fair. I recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is good! Total hole in the wall place, very Asian style decor, and decent size menu. Try the garlic beef and sesame chicken. Food came out quick and they always came by for refills."}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant is great they never let you run out of water. Right away we were given free wontons,  nothing special but still nice and we were served hot oolong tea. The portions are pretty large and served with white rice. You are also offered a free dessert, it was a fried wonton filled with banana and dusted with powdered sugar. The vibe in the restaurant is pretty authentic and the owner walks around to check on you. All in all I enjoyed his place very much."}
{"text":"Worst service, unfriendly host,and owner is the most phony lady you will ever meet! Food not that good skip this place 20 yrs have proven nothing but they are all done in the business."}
{"text":"Not my favorite Chinese restaurant. Just my favorite restaurant.
You want a personal hotspot for a humble dining experience? Golden gate. Do you want immediate prompt service with intimate ambiance? Golden gate? Delicious food with friendly service, without a moment to wait? Golden gate. 
Please support this place, I absolutely love it"}
{"text":"While in the same vein as all American Chinese Takeout restaurants we all know and love to some degree.  Most of those though all taste the same and are indistinguishable from each other in my opinion.

Golden Gate is more than that and is by far the best Chinese takeout I have ever had.  Best Kung Po Chicken by far I have ever had, though only try it if oyu like spicy food as it is quite spicy.  Spring Rolls by far the best as well.

But its their Sweet and Sour Chicken which amazed me the most.  While most Chinese takeout's sweet and sour chicken seems like its made of McDonald's Chicken McNuggets, Golden Gate's is actual pieces of chicken breasts that has been hand breaded and deep fried.  Really really good.

The only con of theirs is they don't do delivery. But I am more than willing to drive for their food."}
{"text":"Been back a couple times since.  I just want to point out that even on their busiest nights, this restaurant remains calms, cool and welcoming. Warm and happy servers, wonderful food.  They just don't miss!  If there were more than 5 stars, this is one Restaurant I'd surely give the best rating to.  :-)"}
{"text":"Went in for some quick take out. The only person available to talk to couldn't answer any questions. She didn't the know what was in any of the dishes and she couldn't tell me what dishes the pictures were of on the menu. I finally just chose two dishes that I was already familiar with just because I was tired of hearing \"I don't know.\" I definitely will not be back to this establishment."}
{"text":"Happy nice folks;

Quit decent food and a reasonable price.

If you are in the neighborhood give it a shot."}
{"text":"By far the worst food I've ever had in Lakewood. Kung Pao Chicken? Unseasoned chicken with undercooked vegetables and red glop... 
Lakewood is known for it's good restaurants, this is not one of them. It almost seems like they were trying to make it mediocre.
I can't imagine this place will be around much longer with this kind of quality."}
{"text":"Good ole time type Chinese restaurant. Slow service at times. But good food. Gotta try it for the lunch SPECIAL."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, I LOVE the food! Take out is fast and eating in is awesome! The staff is always friendly and efficient. My cup was never less than half full. I have several favorites on the menu, the worst part about this restaurant is trying to decide which one to order!"}
{"text":"Threw my lemon chicken in the trash - felt bad about it, realized that poor 'bird' already had far worse things done to it. 

Accompanying fried rice was sweet and weird. Won't return. I highly encourage the owners of Golden Gate Chinese to drive up to Chinatown and try some actual good food. Heck maybe they could bring some back to Henderson and sell it to me."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst Chinese I've ever had. I can't believe this place had decent yelp reviews. I feel like a stone cold sucker!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for about 30 yrs.   Always love the food. Big portions. Great service.   Full lunch, I mean alot of food for under $ 9.00.  Mom they Saturday  until 3.    We were there today for lunch"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaraunt in the valley.  The service is fast and friendly and the prices are reasonable.  The staff here is so amazing, I can't stress it enough.  Very recently I called them with a sizeable order late one evening, only 20 minutes before they were set to close. They assured me that it was no problem at all.  When I ran up to their door they were there waiting for me, order in hand, and greeted me by name!

I have tried several of the dishes and I have found them all to be delightful. I frequently order take out and it never takes more than 15 minutes to be ready and is always fresh and hot.  Eating in is equally enjoyable, the service is prompt, they serve complimentary tea, and at the end of the meal they serve a complimentary pastry filled with banana and dusted with powdered sugar. 

I've enjoyed the lunch specials on numerous occasions and they are awesome.  The egg rolls here are the best I've had in a long time!  Even at lunch the portions are very large, but are super cheap!  The lunch specials even extend to Saturdays!

Recommended dishes: Garlic Chicken, Golden Gate Special Beef, Mushu Pork, Pork Fried Rice"}
{"text":"I had never purchased food that was entirely inedible until I made the unfortunate mistake of ordering here. Smelled awful, tasted worse."}
{"text":"I have not had better chinese food since moving to Arizona.  The restaurant was 3/4 full on a Tuesday night!!!  With many Asian people.  I thought in this \"recession\" that having a restaurant that packed was a pretty amazing thing.  The service was superb.  The food was overall yummy.  I did not enjoy the greasy wonton chips that are served for free before the meal.  My friend really like them though?!?!  The hot tea was good.  My veggie dish (something with bamboo shoots, mushrooms, green pepper, broccoli, ect.) and steamed rice was good.  I ate every single bite.  The free dessert (wontons filled with banana and others with plum maybe?) were yummy.  The total bill with tax and tip for 2 entrees and 1 soda was $24.  I left full and happy."}
{"text":"Depending what you order, it can be very delicious or just good food. 

As an adult, I am use to specialty hipster foods now. 

However, this restaurant carries a lot of nostalgia for me since I ate here during my teen years.  

I love the lunch specials, they are always very delicious to me.  Plus the service is always good and friendly.  

I'm happy they treated my little one (5 months old) very kindly.  

I like places that are baby friendly.  I do not know about their bathrooms.  So I don't know if it's baby friendly that way.... Just that it's a nice restaurant and I had a good time with my family"}
{"text":"Let me just say thank you to everyone that left a good review because it is your reviews that led me to this gem. OMG!!!!!! From the moment we walked in it smelled delicious. We started off with the stuffed shrimp and it just got better from there. I chose the house special chicken with the sherry wine sauce and damn was it good. My honey had the Mongolian beef and oooooh weeeeee it was bomb.com. We were on the search to find a Chinese place that would become one our faves and we have found it. The servers were attentive and friendly and checked on us often. The ONLY thing I would wish for would be a larger serving of the house fried rice. Overall we were more than pleased and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very tasty food.  Maybe a little pricey for what you get but great taste and atmosphere.  The banana desert they give is really good."}
{"text":"Very tasty authentic food.  Very well cooked and tasty, the garlic chicken is delicious.  Some of the staff are less friendly than others and they have occasionally given me the wrong take out order by mistake... but overall a great place to eat.  If you're looking for authentic Chinese food this is where it's at!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food we've found nearby so far. Had the crab angels and house/garlic chicken. Both were great. Pork fried rice was good."}
{"text":"There are numerous Chinese restaurants in and around this area.......with that being said This one is pretty good. I wish the portions were a little bigger but the food flavor is pretty good. I've had the kung pao chicken, sweet and sour chicken, and the pork fried rice....they are all worth a try."}
{"text":"Tried this place for my second ... and final time. 

Golden Gate reminds me of Chinese in the Midwest, only ignorant people would rate this 4 stars. That this placed has existed at this location for many years shows there is no accounting for taste. 

This is Lazy Chinese Food for White People .... LCFWP

You've been warned!

Do yourself a favor an head a few miles south (past C-Fu) to China King for Dim Sum an authentic Chinese Dishes."}
{"text":"Some colleagues and I decided to come here for lunch after our show was over. I am from Los Angeles so I know good Chinese food and good Amercanized Chinese food.  Most of their food is geared to the American palette.

When we first walked in I was very happy that they had the AC cranked up on high. The Décor was new and the place was very Clean. 

A very sweet lady seated us in the large table in the back of the dining room. The Service was very fast and friendly. Our group was very hungry so we over ordered which was great because I enjoyed almost every dish. 
We ordered:
Walnut Shrimp *****
House Fried Rice****
Steamed Fish*****
Chicken with String Beans*****
Beef with Broccoli*****
MaoPao ToFu****
Stir Fried Veggies****
Stuffed Bitter Melon****

I officially love this place. I chatted with the owner for a little bit and found out they were originally moved to Las Vegas from Alababma a couple of years ago. Must be why they were so nice. Next time I am back in Las Vegas I am definitely coming back and saying hello to the owners. I rate this place 4.5 Stars and I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"You have to try the popcorn chicken and pepper steak!!! I do not know how much I need to emphasize this. For the longest time, ever since I came back from my trip from Taiwan, I craved for Chinese popcorn chicken. I've tried multiple places, but theirs is the closest to authentic popcorn chicken. It's crispy on the outside and so juicy on the inside!!! As for the pepper steak, it's the sauce and meat that will make you wanting to come back for more!"}
{"text":"A friend turned us onto this place, and I'm so glad she did. We've eaten here multiple times and have never been disappointed. Our favorite thing to do is order the happy platter and then split an entree. We've tried a number of the chicken dishes--all are tasty, especially the garlic chicken. And now, we have fun taking other friends and family members here."}
{"text":"Inexpensive Chinese food, but quite bland.  If you like Szechwuan or other spicy varieties, this is not your place.  Sweet and sour was okay."}
{"text":"There is a reason this place has been open for 30years. Staff was wonderful and welcoming. Food was delicious and plated beautifully.  We ordered the House Special Eggfoo Young and Mapodofou is a must have. My favorite dish was actually their Hot and Sour Soup and my 2yr old love it too :)"}
{"text":"Golden Gate is very disappointing.  I wonder how it could muster a 4-star average on yelp.  I went there with my neighbor on a whim and a prayer.  The place was clean and the service was good.  The table top had a stack of about 4 sheets of commercial paper for easy clean up.  The seats were covered in a plastic sheathe.   The food was thoroughly unremarkable.  We started with the crab puffs and teriyaki chicken skewers.  The crab puffs appeared to have a decent amount of crab, but the wanton casing appeared old and stale.  It wasn't served with any type of dipping sauce.  The teriyaki chicken skewer appeared to be deep-fried chicken tenders with absolutely no teriyaki sauce or flavor besides a soy sauce marinade.  They were left unfinished.  The entrees looked like 100% frozen meats and sauces.  They were absolutely artificial and flavorless.  Simply heated to a warm temperature and served on \"Golden Gate\" etched faux-china.  The place really needs to catch up about 30 years."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in years and much has not changed. I like the fact the the booths and tables are spread out over several rooms (keeps the noise down) and that your meal comes with tea (piping hot in its own little metal pot). I was seated immediately for lunch at 11:30am and my order was taken promptly. You get a steaming bowl of either egg drop soup or sweet and sour soup with your meal. I got the egg drop. It was good, but not the best I have ever had. The meals also come with an spring roll (very good) and 2 small fried won tons (mainly won ton wrappers with so little filling I could not figure out what the filling was supposed to be) and a fortune cookie.

For my entree I chose the Lemon Chicken ($6.75). This includes a large bowl of fresh fried rice and enough lemon chicken for 2 meals. I needed a to-go box and have plenty left over for supper. The dish has large pieces of chicken breast, battered and fried with a lemon sauce poured over it. If you get some of the sauce it tastes very strong of lemon. If you get a piece without the sauce then it just tastes like fried chick. I wondered if a little lemon zest in the chicken batter would amp up the lemon flavor in the chicken itself?

Service is terrific. The restaurant is very clean (but I was baffled with the white butcher paper on top of the table cloth). Parking is close to the door. Oh, and I loved the aquarium in the dining area (it was very clean, with lively gold-colored fish)."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, reasonable price and the food is good. Service is excellent for a chinese restaurant, place is clean. Its not the best tasting chinese you can find but its a lot better than most."}
{"text":"I thought I was trying out a divey Chinese restaurant today.  It's in a broken down strip mall that looks like it was built too closely to the freeway.

Funny thing is that it wasn't a dive inside.  It was dark and a little plain, but the food and decor reminded me of East Coast Chinese places.  Fish tank.  Hot tea and spicy mustard on the table.  Awesome egg drop soup, and the egg rolls were fresh and crunchy.  The chicken & shrimp lunch entree was nothing special, but it came with a small pot of fried rice, which is another nice touch.

Fast service.  Reasonably priced.  The place was crowded, and now I know why.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm from San Francisco and we have lots of Chinese restaurants. My mother and I are on vacation and looked this place up on yelp. We wanted Chinese and yelp showed this place to be closer but was a few blocks off. We walked close to a mile or the place and it was well worth it. Better then some Chinese restaurants where I'm from. We ordered the fish with black bean sauce and the braised beans both really good. Also ordered the beef fried rice that lacked flavor. Other than that if I'm in the area I would come again. Also friendly staff. Thanks guys. :)"}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in the valley!    

We have been dining here over 30 years. 

Great food selection with awesome customer service.
Everything here is absolutely delicious!  Quality is top drawer.

It is worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for the past 13 years, and each visit is just as amazing as it has always been. The hot and sour soup, egg rolls, crab puffs, and garlic chicken are family favorites, and are consistently delicious!! You cannot beat the lunch specials--huge portions of amazing fresh food for less money than I would spend on a meal at Wendy's. I LOVE Golden Gate!"}
{"text":"Great prices and friendly staff.  Our waiter didn't seem to speak English very well, but understood enough that our orders were all heard and made as ordered.  I've only had the Egg Drop Soup, Orange Chicken, and Lemon Chicken all on three separate visits and they were fantastic every time!"}
{"text":"Spent a few weeks in China and My daughter spent 6 months there, so we were looking for a place to give us that \"We're eating real Chinese food\"  feeling...  This place SAYS that, but it is standard stuff.  If you like sweet Americanized \"Panda Express\" type food  (I like my Panda Express too at times), then this might be a place to go.  When we asked for different dishes to see if they had any traditional ones we were told  \"well in China, when Americans show up they give you a different menu...\"  Those of you who have been to China know that frequently there are just a bunch of pictures of food on the wall as a menu, the menus you do get typically are in Chinese, and that the food you get in China tastes QUITE different from what you get here, unless you go to KFC or Pizza Hut....  Our quest continues - I'll post if I find one that is really great!"}
{"text":"Fast service and attentive! The pekking noodles are great and the pad thai! I also love the complementary items."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for almost 30 years because the food is so amazing! Service is always great, whether you dine in or take out. Several friends are now fans of this place after going with me and the owner Sue is such a sweet lady! Decor is pretty outdated but this place is definitely the hidden gem in this old strip mall. Inexpensive food that is much better than any high priced Asian restaurants. No joke, I'd take Golden Gate over P.F. Chang's or Benihana ANY DAY! :-)"}
{"text":"I have no idea what's up with reviews here. It's an American Chinese restaurant and for most dishes it's better than New China King across the street, which somehow has a 4/5 average here (New China King's meat quality is AWFUL. Deep fried chicken for kung pao chicken? Cha siu for every single pork dish?).

I was happy to see Moo Shu Pork on the menu as many places in Lakewood don't have it. I ordered it with beef (Moo Shu Beef) and it was better than expected - much better flavor than the same dish at Jackie Chen Dragon Tower (another 4/5 average here) and the portion was huge (though there wasn't a ton of meat). The beef was good quality and you could tell the veggies were fresh. They gave me five large pancakes and I easily filled all five. Pretty good for $9. They also gave a bag of oolong tea in the bag which I enjoyed.

No, it's not in the same league as any of the places in Asia Town but it's definitely a better spot than many of numerous Chinese restaurants in the area and a good restaurant in the \"Chinese American\" genre. I wouldn't let the Yelp reviews put you off from this place - I did and I was missing out! This place has great reviews on Google which is what made me try this place and if you want some basic comfort food, give it a try.

I suppose it's possible over the past couple of years they served some food that wasn't up to their name - there was apparently family drama (same family running this place since 1981!) and it was briefly up for sale. But since a couple of weeks ago, after a lot of consideration, it's no longer up for sale and is staying in the family so I'm sure you can expect good stuff from here on out."}
{"text":"When i first move to an area i have a checklist...grocery store, hole in the wall bar, a couple great restaurants...one of which much be chinese.

i was not let down by Golden Gate. Its a small dark ambiance which i love. The staff is courteous and by now know me when i place my order or walk in with new recruits. 

almost as if routine i order the usual sweet and sour pork *light delicious sauce with generous vegetables* crab angels, chow mein and fried rice. i love all of it. then just when you think you're finished, here comes the fried banana for dessert. unbelievable.

every time i recommend this place to my friends, they take a look at the plain exterior and give me the sideways look. the if something goes down im throwing you directly in front of me as a human shield look. then they sink their teeth into their first bite of food. 

they they too become golden gate addicts. in a couple words? i HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"Food is always spot on. Very yummy! Whenever I crave Chinese food they are the place I run too."}
{"text":"First visit recently and I thought highly of it...

Pro's
- value.   For the lunch price and what you get, it's a great value!! (that's what earned the 5th star)
- quality of food I felt was very good.  Had twice cooked pork and veggies and the pork were all good 
- several people waited on me; good, friendly service. 

Cons'
- it is a little dark inside.  

There are several options for this cuisine; I'll come back...."}
{"text":"This place is hidden and not the best decor, but the food is pretty good. The portions are big, which is good since we have a big family.  I like that they serve white rice with all the meals and you can always get more. It's definitely not the best place that I have been. But the food was good and the service was good. Very attentive and they make sure you have everything you need. I will go back to eat there again."}
{"text":"Dad's pick for lunch. The outside has no visual sign for entrance  other than the bright red asian door. The interior decor is very dated. ..don't be alarmed!!
Owners certainly could invest in the outdated decor and a good scrubbing wouldn't hurt either.  Very busy for 2pm on a Sunday afternoon.  So business is good! 

 The quality of the meats are very good and the flavors were very good.  The cashew shrimp was very bland.  The garlic chicken was good,  not spicy. Portion sizes were mediocre for the prices.  Came with white rice,  would have liked a choice of brown or fried.  
 
Service was excellent.  I was very thirsty and my water glass was never left empty for long considering how busy they were.  Will come back and try different dishes next time."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find a Chinese food place near me and by the yelp reviews I thought this place is worth a try. I got the combo lo mein, orange chicken, crab Rangoon and egg rolls. The lo mein noodles were very tasty but the chicken, beef and especially the shrimp were not very good. Lacked flavor and the shrimp tasted really fishy. The orange chicken had no flavor and the tempura coating was soggy. I will say the crab Rangoon was delicious and the egg rolls were tasty as well. Unfortunately although the guy working there was nice I won't be returning here. My search continues!"}
{"text":"Super good food! Also the service is extraordinary!  I've been three times and can't wait for more."}
{"text":"The best Chinese fast food place so far. We bough Mongolian beef, general Tao chicken, combo kungpao, chow mein and the stuffed wontons. All were pretty good except the wontons lacked flavor and stuffing. But overall pretty good..."}
{"text":"Food: excellent. Everything I've tried has been great.
Service: excellent.
Ambience: yes, it's dark. I always get takeout so I don't care either way. The only problem I have with Golden Gate is a lingering cloud of sewer funk out front; it's there every time I go."}
{"text":"The owner is one of the most beautiful people I have ever met. Today was my first time here and I got carry out.   The house fried rice and egg drop soup was amazing.   I will be back to dine in next."}
{"text":"It was blend but good cooked food for the pad thai but everything else was good."}
{"text":"The best restuarant in the Valley.  I love everything I've had there and have never been disappointed.  Sue the owner walks around and talks to the people.  Our favorite waitress is Annie.  She is superb.. We go there at least one a month."}
{"text":"This place scared me. It didn't have windows. :(

I took my order to go. Did I mention this place didn't have windows?!

I ordered their lemon chicken, pad thai (at a chinese restaurant?!) and wonton soup.

It was ok, but not enough for me to warrant writing anymore on this place aside from...

This place didn't have any windows!!! It was a bit creepy. :("}
{"text":"This place is great. Love the Orange Chicken and the House Fried Rice. 

Clean and Great Service."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite Chinese restaurant in the area, but it seems it has been taken over by new ownership. The flavor is nowhere near what it used to be. The husband and wife who used to run the restaurant were very nice and we knew our food would be delicious every time. With the recent changes, they have lost the flavor and therefore, have lost us as customers."}
{"text":"Been going here for 10+ years! Food is still excellent. Service is great! Old school Chinese food and decor.. What you think about a Chinese food place should taste and look like!"}
{"text":"This is a love note. It's gonna be gushy. If that is gonna annoy you, the short story is: this place is amazing you should go; get the Golden Gate Special Beef, Kun Po Chicken, and you should be very happy. If you are OK to indulge me, read on.

This accurate review will be strewn with sentimental nostalgia. You have been warned. Also, for those that enjoy humorous anecdotes of sensitive lads taking themselves too seriously, I've added something at the end for ya... 

The Golden Gate atmosphere is comfortably classic in its Chinese Restaurant rendering. I have never had bad service. It has always been courteous, graceful, and swift.

My love affair with Golden Gate began in 1982. I was 17. I was taken to GG by Jong Kil Kang and his wife Soon following a Tae Kwon Do tournament at MCC. We were famished. The meal was a victory lap for us. We had mopped up the competition.

We had War Wonton Soup, Hot and Sour Soup, Kun Po Chicken, Peking Chow Mein, Moo Shu Pork, GG Special Fish Filets, Szechwan Beef, Golden Gate Special Beef, House Fried Rice, and eggrolls. We even got some Kimchi. God I love Kimchi. Don't expect that now. The kimchi hookup was back in the day and this place is Chinese not Korean.

Ok, so this smorgasbord was life transforming. It was a flavorful awakening to Chinese food possibilities. It set the bar high, stratospherically high for Asian cuisine experiences to come. As I look back on all my previous visits, I cannot think of a time when service or food quality dipped below my high expectations.

Following my initial visit, this establishment soon became the family-style-dining gathering place for my friends. My friends weren't part of my TKD world, but everyone likes to eat and we were all family-close. We would save for weeks, then euphorically jump into a table for 8, lazy-Susan in the middle, gaze wide-eyed at our menu, hungrily and joyously embarking on our Chinese Food Adventure for the month. Friends do silly things, like challenging each other to eat exclusively with chopsticks or to do so left handed. It was awesome and tasty and none of us will ever forget those life-defining and life-affirming times. It was glorious. It was the Big Chill seasoned with the most amazing Chinese Food the Valley of the Sun had to offer... then or now.


To be continued, the evening of Feb 1st."}
{"text":"This place is my most favorite Chinese restaurant. I can drink the warm tea by the gallon and the service is always spot on along with the food. I go here every time I am in Phoenix or near. It's not exactly in a real great area, but it's worth the trip. I had pad thai with shrimp last time and we started with pork dumplings. The portions are good for a couple meals and this review makes me want to eat there now!"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you. I was recommended this place, and the outside almost stopped me from eating there. Once inside, it is beautiful. White table tops, with delicate china. Once seated, you are greeted with nice staff, and marvelous starters. The food is amazing. Had generous serving sizes. Overall the food was amazing, staff was excellent, and environment inside was perfect."}
{"text":"This place is spectacular.  Everything from the service to the food is top of the line.  They present a wonderful multiple course American-Chinese menu that satisfies many taste buds.  The complimentary tea with entrees could not be more of a plus. My family has eaten at this restaurant for years next to the the music lesson store and it has always been a special place for us. The owner treats us like family when we see her and the environment is always comforting.  I drive over forty five minutes to eat at golden gate still because it is worth it. Best crab angels."}
{"text":"A surprisingly lovely restaurant! The complimentary hot tea, fried \"chips,\" and dessert were all very welcome, and the relaxing atmosphere offered a nice respite. The service was attentive but not pesky. The flavors of our particular dishes didn't \"wow\" me, hence the lack of 5 stars, but the food was flavorful and good for the price! Both of our servings were generous enough for leftovers, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT! 

Nothing can describe it better. The restaurant has been transformed in every aspect. Owners, staff, food, atmosphere, service, absolutely everything. 

Honestly, this is a whole new restaurant and you must try it. I use to be a regular at the old golden gate and it was just plain mediocre. 

I ordered the sesame chicken, kung pao chicken and fried rice. You will taste the difference right away. The meat was FRESH! Not old meat like a lot of Chinese restaurants use. I would know. My whole family is from China. 

What's even better? The service! A lot of Chinese restaurants aren't known for service, but this place is different. The owner herself, Maggie came to talk to us and even gave us a sample of their famous popcorn chicken! 

The chef himself, is the owner as well! They never hire anyone that will water down the quality of their food. 

This is my new favorite Chinese restaurant and I have become a new regular of this place."}
{"text":"yeah, it might be a little eerie and kill bill-ish in there, but the food is fantastic. we were the only ones in there for a while so it was extra eerie..the service was alright. very ethnic and authentic chinese atmosphere, not so americanized.

the pot of tea was piping hot but especially delicious. the wonton chips were a good start. we went with the moo shoo pork and kung pao chicken, both pretty good. the crepes that the moo shoo pork came in were so soft and fluffy and the meat and seasonings were spot on. the kung pao chicken was a little water and not as spicy as i thought it was going to be. but it had peanuts, bamboo shoots, and my favorite chinese vegetable, water chestnuts...mmmm. the big bowl of rice we got was delicious as well.

and all for under $20. grubby good. especially for a city with lackluster chinese food."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Good food and good atmosphere for dine-in. I've tried a few different dishes that I have enjoyed. Unlike alot of places lately their food has not been greasy at all each time. Appetizers were a little better than average and the soup was very decent. The main dishes is what I enjoyed most."}
{"text":"My BF and I were in town for the Insight Bowl, won by ISU, 14-13!!!  We decided to try GG as we wanted to get away from the crowds for dinner.  This was a good choice and much better than we expected.  We ordered the egg drop soup.  It was hot, not luke warm, had good flavor and bits of chicken.  The dumpling order was 8 large pcs, with plenty of meat and the skin was thick and hearty!  Very good and the sauce was just spicy enough, too!.  The first dish was the Mongolian Beef.  It was well marinated and very tasty with sauteed green and white onions.  We also had the chicken with plum sauce.  I wanted mild today and the server suggested this.  I was hesitate at first because it said it had bamboo shoots.  Sometimes they are added as filler to make the dish look like more food.  This was not the case as there was almost no bamboo and no waterchestnuts!  The veggies were green peppers, onions, pea pods and mushrooms.  And there was plenty of chicken too!  We were not able to finish and took the rest home in an ice chect!  Definitely one Chinese Restaurant to try if you're in Mesa, Az!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  I moved not far from this establishment.  I needed a quick night out and talked husband into chinese food.

We ordered the family B dinner special.  I ordered garlic shrimp and husband ordered orange chicken.  We had wonton soup, egg rolls, crab ragoons, and chicken fried rice with the meal.  

The meal started off strong with the wonton soup.  Fresh veggies, good flavor.  The egg roll didn't taste like much and the crab ragoon made me sad.

I enjoyed the garlic shrimp, but husband's orange chicken was not good.  I made him take home the extra, but even my son won't eat it.  We should have just gone to Panda Express.  That's what I get for being fancy."}
{"text":"I have to start by saying we have loved this restaurant over the years and the owner and staff have always made it a great experience. The food  was very good. Having said that,  the owner sold the place and the food is not good at all now. The new owner took a good place  with good food and cheapened it and the food is not fresh or tasty.  They now have cheap watered down squeeze bottles of mustard and sweet and sour  to put on the food that I'm sure has been reheated in a microwave.  What a travesty! A sad day for us."}
{"text":"ALWAYS so impressed with this restaurant. 
Impeccable service. 
Outstanding food. 
Nuff said."}
{"text":"After reading all of the other reviews, I can't help but think that I hit this place up on an off night.(?) My bf ordered some kind of chicken, that was fried and served with a clear sauce.  It was o.k.  I ordered a scallop dish, and honestly, the sauce just smelled like something that was spoiled.  It was not edible.  I am Asian, I have consumed all sorts of things, so it was not the smell of the seafood, or anything like that.  I have eaten Chinese in Hawaii, Japan and California.  I do not consider myself a chinese food snob, as I have been known to eat at Panda Express on occasion.  I really wanted to like this place, but I couldn't.  Even the eggrolls were bad.I cannot comment on the service, as we had take-out.   Sorry,  Golden Gate...."}
{"text":"Def one of the better if  not my best of the East Valley. The owners are very welcoming and its a nice quiet place. I'm a huge fan of fried rice and sweet and sour and they do both very well. I love the chips in the beginning and who doesn't love ending a meal with a fried banana delicious bite!! MMmmmmm Enjoy"}
{"text":"We have been going to this restaurant for years! They have wonderful service, delish food and a great atmosphere! Su is such a friendly and sweet host, our family loves it!"}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere! A proper Chinese restaurant with excellent service and ambience. You would never guess it from the outside, but this is a fabulous Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"Ordered some delicious take-out from Golden Gate tonight. Had the Golden Gate Beef. The food was great and the ladies who served us were extremely friendly. They even gave us a free calendar! Such nice folks."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch last Friday.  Their lunch specials menu runs to 4PM.  I had the kung pao triple--chicken, beef, and shrimp. There was a good amount of meat in the dish and the beef was especially tasty for a quick service place.  The egg rolls could use some work, though."}
{"text":"Adding my love for Golden Gate.  I live just on the other side of the 101 so it's either GG or Wong's for Chinese options (and Lychee Inn but I've yet to venture in). I strongly prefer GG after trying each a few times.  My faves at GG are the sesame chicken, the crab angels, and the house chicken.  The beef and broccoli is a family favorite as well. Takeout service is uber fast - usually about 5 minutes so it's good I live only a quarter mile away :)"}
{"text":"Same as it was 20 years ago. Went for lunch after recently returning to the valley of the sun. Not much to write about my lunch. Portion was small. just some breaded chicken some sickeningly sweet sauce and some walnuts. Boring. I had the hot and sour soup that was oddly thick and had WAY too much tofu. The place inside was dark and old and seemed dirty. The bathroom opens to the dining area, so that made it seem worse. Probably wont be back. Disappointing. I remember something better. but maybe its because i was young and hadnt experienced a better place."}
{"text":"My family has been going here since I was really little and we have never had a bad experience. Nothing about it has changed in the past 20 years. They have your food out fast and are always around to fill your water cup. Love it!"}
{"text":"Stop and read before eating here so you can save yourself. I don't understand how the reviews are decent for this joint or that this place is still open. There was 3 of us and we were there for almost 2 hours for 3 cocktails and 2 egg drop soups, potstickers and 2 entrees both with chicken. The restaurant wasn't packed either. One of the egg drop soups came out and had a black hair in it, none of us at the table have black hair. also when the lady came back we told her about the hair in the soup and she apologized, picked up the bowl of hair soup started to take one step away and sat the bowl of soup on the table in front of us (which also had guest) and i never saw her pick back up the bowl of soup which means the hair soup was served to the table in front of us. The potstickers were decent. Once out entrees arrived (almost an hour later) we started eating when we noticed the chicken wasn't quite right so we stopped eating it. We couldn't figure out if the chicken was just very poor quality, microwaved, under cooked (bcuz it was pink in some pieces) or even chicken at all. Now it's the next day and 2 of us are sick as 10 dogs. I would give 2 stars since the pot stickers were fine but currently 2 of us are camping out in the bathrooms and 1 of us had to MISS WORK! This place needs to be investigated by the Health Dept ASAP!"}
{"text":"My family loves eating at Golden Gate.  We've been here about 4 times.  Food is great and reasonably priced.  The owner, Sue Kao, who seems to be there everytime we go, is extremely nice.  We enjoy supporting this local, family owned business.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We tried this place today because of all the favorable reviews on here and it turned out awesome!  Service, prices, and the quality of food were top-notch!  We will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"It was my turn to pick a restaurant, so based on the reviews from YELP, I choose this one. We ordered the Mu Shu Pork, crispy duck and Peking Pan Fried noodles.

The service was wonderful and courteous. Now, when they bring out the hot tea without asking and its complimentary, that is old school and what I am used to. The crispy wonton skins was an added plus.

The waitress made up the mu shu pork with the pan cakes. They used a lot of bean sprouts which took away some of the flavor but it still was good. As for the Peking Pan Fried noodles, I guess I like the Hong Kong style of noodles better which is more crisp. It looked like they added the Chow King noodles from the can and had the sauce soften them. Again, there were a lot of bean sprouts in the dish. The crispy duck was good, but my wife thought it was a little dry. I loved it. Told her she should have ordered the Roast Duck instead.

To top it off, we were given a fortune cookie and a wonton puff  with honey inside and powdered sugar on top. Nice way to end the meal. BTW, I had enough left over to enjoy lunch the next day."}
{"text":"This place is the best!!! Their customer service is 100%! Been coming to this restaurant for a couple of years now and the owner is always there. She remembers you and always welcome you with a smile. She has been paining this place for 30 years! Amazing. Have tried their sesame chicken, garlic chicken and their pepper steak. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood chinese restaurant. We've been going there for 15 years. Try the War Wonton Soup!"}
{"text":"My family and I were in search of something new.  We were greeted with kind smiles and seated promptly. Our glasses were never empty, our food served fresh and hot, the food absolutely delicious, and we had the pleasure to meet the owner Sue. Sue introduced herself to everyone, shared stories about the business, and said her goodbyes when we were walking out. It's such a pleasure to meet a business owner who has passion for what she does. We will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"We've been searching for a good Chinese Restaurant for some time and think we have found it.  At first glance I thought the portions small however, we had large quantities of food to take home.  The food was not overpowering nor high in sodium, but had a good texture and well blended flavor.  Although the establishment isn't huge, it was clean; ambiance was good; food was excellent; and service was quick, efficient, & served with a smile.  

If you're searching for a good Asian/Chinese  restaurant, you should definitely try this HIDDEN GEM.  I don't think you will be sorry.

Definitely going back--all the way from SE Mesa."}
{"text":"As a long time resident of the east valley, Golden Gate was always our \"go to\" for Chinese food. A relocation to Idaho has made me even more aware as to just how much I miss this place. Nothing in Idaho compares. However on recent visits back to the valley and Golden Gate I have noticed some changes that warrant 2 stars rather than 5. Things are just not what they used to be. Where is Sue? Golden Gate, affectionately known as \"GG\" to many regular customers, was lovingly referred to as \"Sue's\" in my family. Sue, the gracious owner, was just about always there to greet you with a smile and make you feel welcome. She made a point of visiting with her customers, treating them like family. Her customers became her friends. Many of life's milestones were celebrated there at Golden Gate with Sue. On my last visit to the valley I had a chance run in with Sue. All of the changes that long time customers are so aware of make more sense after our visit. Sue has sold Golden Gate and is transitioning into retirement. The restaurant has been her passion, her life, for 30 plus years. She spoke of how much she misses her friends, the business, and also of how flattered and honored she was to have such loving and loyal customers. I'm certain that her faithful customers and friends  join me in wishing Sue every happiness as she embarks on this next chapter of her life."}
{"text":"Quiet and calm. The have a little fountain and a tank with huge goldfish. And they play relaxing oriental music. Your typical Chinese restaurant. They serve hot Oolong tea with your water which is really nice.
The food is basic but good. I've tried the Mooshu pork and the Sesame chicken. Both what you'd expect. My fav tho, is the Singing Rice soup. A pork and shrimp soup with a very light broth. It sings when the dehydrated fried rice hits the hot broth, it snap-crackle-pops like your rice crispys! Fun And tastey. You may need some soy tho, as it is a Very light broth.
Otherwise good service, good food"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Been there for lunch/dinner maybe 20 times, and have had ONE below average visit. The service borders on amazing. Somehow they are at your table constantly taking care of you WITHOUT being disruptive. It's very tricky!  The food is good, and the portions are generous. The one time we had an issue was simply because the tea came to us cold, and our waitress was having a seriously hard time explaining a dish to us, and taking our order (language issue). But every other time we dined there, it was amazing! The prices are so low for such quality/quantity/service, it will keep you coming back for more. I only wish they had some more variety insofar as vegetarian dishes go....Their menu could be from the '70's. Try it for lunch, the specials are a bargain."}
{"text":"This is still one of my favorite Chinese food places. Take out was quick and yummy!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since before I was born. It was one of my parents' first date places back in the day and remains a family favorite. If I'm looking to impress friends I take them here. The food and service are consistently good. The owner is very involved and will remember regulars by name even if they have been gone for years. The portions are served family style and there is always extra. Left overs are great the next day. When I'm feeling sick there's nothing like the Hot and Sour Soup to make me feel better. My personal favorite is the crab angels."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Chinese restaurant ever! We've been coming here for over 17 years!! Today was extra special as we celebrated our son's bday. The staff went above and beyond to make certain we had a wonderful time. The food was amazing as usual! Thank you again for such an amazing time!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years and years. Tonight was my daughters 15th birthday and this is where she wanted dinner. The first time she ate here she was 2!! The owner knows us by name and always has kind words for our kids...but I ramble...the food never disappoints. The Hot and Sour Soup is the best in town and I have never eaten a dish I was unhappy with. Our family favorites are the Orange Chicken, the Cashew Nut Chicken, and the Mu Shu Pork. They always serve hot tea to the table and the service is VERY attentive. Come it at lunch you will be amazed how far your dollar goes! Thank you Golden Gate for the wonderful birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Quick and good service. It's a good deal for the amount and quality of food you get. The restaurant is both fancy and casual at the same time so you can make it whatever kind of outing you would like!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Phoenix! The crab angels are amazing, both the orange chicken and sweet and sour chicken are excellent, and the fried rice is delicious! I have eaten here for over 15 years and never once been disappointed. Amazing restaurant!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at Golden Gate today. It's a charming place. Very nicely decorated. Service was good. Best of all the food was delicious! Sweet and sour chicken was very tasty and tender. Hot and Sour soup great. My guest had Pad Thai and was delicious. We ordered from the lunch menu and could NOT finish all the food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Apparently this place has been here for 30+ years. I can see why, I really can. 
Tonight is my second visit here. It's time for me to review.
Golden Gate is definitely a step up from anywhere around here. The staff is extremely friendly. They go around and talk to the guests. I say guests and not customers because they really make you feel welcome. The décor is a bit out dated. But I've seen other restaurants close to here that look even older. They keep this place clean and uncluttered. Unlike other older places that tend to have piles of junk in corners and stuff on shelves... We've all seen places like those. This is NOT that type of establishment. They obviously take pride in their business.
The menu is far better than others as well. My first visit I had the double cooked pork. Which was on my scale 8.5/10 only because I was expecting breaded pork but theirs is not. Still it was very good. 
The second visit I had the Golden Gate spicy shrimp. MAN! It was GOOD! 10/10 for sure! Their hot and sour soup is excellent too! They bring you complimentary hot tea and won ton chips as you sit down. Nice touch. 
They play nice soothing music, quietly so you can hear your own conversations. I can't believe it took me so long to come here. This place is TOP NOTCH. Srsly.


If I would change anything it would be this, they charge $4 for noodles if you want to replace it for the rice. (as a Diabetic the less rice you eat the better, noodles aren't that much better but every little bit helps) they should offer the noodles as a substitute for a lower price than $4. 

Other than that, this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time tonight and I am drinking the Golden Gate KoolAid!


The service was top notch, also nice to see a place bring out hot tea right away with out needing to ask for it.


Had the sesame chicken meal with crab puffs, shrimp and the egg roll.

Wow!



Will be back!


Very warm and tasteful place."}
{"text":"This place is very small but offers great service. I liked the flavors in the chicken with string beans and the bqq pork fried rice. I did not enjoy the dipping sauce for the potsticker, way too bland. I also did not enjoy the thai iced tea. It's CANNED! What an agregious offense. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"I am so sad to give this restaurant a 2! My husband and I have been coming here for 20 years. Had our second date here. Never once have had a complaint EVER. Tonight we decided to get a take out order, when we got home we discovered that the pan fried dumplings (the best in az) were not the same and the sauce had completely changed. The food was sub par at best and everything was different. I decided to call and ask if they were under new management and to my sadness the answer was yes. Sue if you are reading this I hope that you know that golden gate has always been amazing! Very very sad to see the food go down so far!"}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was a wee lass and over the years not much has changed.

The service is always polite, the hot tea is always piping hot, the wonton chips are always delightfully greasy, and the food is always tasty and plentiful.

It seems they always have coupons in the local mailers for 15% off. 

Do like I do--place a phone order for a mountain of food, take it home and watch bad movies. Hahaha! You thought all that food was for a family?! Boy, I sure pulled one over on you."}
{"text":"Don't be deceived by the outside! This was a great restaurant. Finding vegetarian options is usually hard to find, but they even suggested dishes they would modify for us. The food came fast and tasted great. Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Some people have said that this place serves the best Chinese food in the Valley.  Others say it sucks.  I have an opinion between the two extremes.

Being from the San Francisco Bay Area, I have had a lot of Chinese food of all qualities and types.  This stuff was pretty mediocre, middle of the road stuff.  The place really does have the look of a 1970s Chinese joint as has been said by other reviewers.  They also have that little mini grill lit by sterno that they put on the table so you can cook meat on a stick (or burn it if you are not careful).  They don't have that back home. . .

Sure, I'd eat there again some time, but this place can't compete even with the average Chinese restaurant in the Bay Area.  You will get a plate of quite edible food here for your dollar, will get good, attentive service, and will leave full--just don't expect anything special in terms of taste."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for 20 years!! Tried just about everything on the menu and never disappointed with our meal. The lunch special is awesome! Also go with Golden Gate Special Beef! My absolute fave!"}
{"text":"Disgusting! 

Terrible service, food was gross! Used to be great going there!

It smells like old dirty wet laundry! 

#stayawayfromthisjoint"}
{"text":"A great favorite of ours. Service is constantly friendly. Food is of excellent quality and portions are huge. They also accept Restaurant.com gift certificates. I highly recommend Golden Gate Chinese Restaurant. After moving from NYC two years ago, this has become our favorite Chinese restaurant in the Phoenix market!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Food was great. This lady knows how to take care of her customers. Not stingy with the food.   We had 5 adults and we ordered one of her specials at $$ per person. She said there would be plenty of food and she only charged us for only four people. What a great business decision. She was more interested  in us being satisfied and made sure we did not overpay for the meal.   She bought our business from now on.   The food was delicious  as was the service. We will definitely go back there again & again. Thant you for age eat meal at a very reasonable"}
{"text":"We were impressed with Golden Gate.

We started with an order of Crab Angels.  $4.50 for 6.  They were plump and the filling had a much higher mixture of crab than most Chinese restaurants provide.

We shared House Fried Rice, Triple Seafood Delight and House Special Chicken.  The fried rice had chicken, beef and shrimp.  The rice alone I would give 3 stars.  The seafood delight lived up to it's name.  I'm normally not a fan of the traditional white wine sauce on this dish but Golden Gate's is very nice.  The scallops were done just right, melt in your mouth.  The crab also was tender and cooked just right with no taste of fishiness.  The shrimp was slightly overdone but still very good.  The house special chicken was a whole chicken breast dipped in a thin coating and deep fried, then sliced and placed over a small serving of vegetables.  The chicken was very tender and flavorful with a robust brown sauce.

My daughter had chosen the restaurant for her birthday dinner and they must have heard us mention it because after the meal they brought out fried dough pockets filled with banana and sprinkled with confectioners sugar.  Nice touch and very tasty.

Our total bill was about $38, a great deal for the quality and quantity of service.  An appetizer, fried rice and 2 entrees shared among 4 people and we brought home 3 boxes of leftovers."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for over 10 years. I grew up in Europe where the Asian restaurants are far more authentic. Golden Gate is about as good as it gets in Phoenix.
It's small and intimate, the service is fast and friendly, the food is amazing, the prices are remarkably low, and it is privately owned and operated. You can't beat it!"}
{"text":"On our first night in Phoenix, after flying in from Savannah, we opted to stay in, relax, unwind, and get caught up with daughter/step daughter, son-in-law/step son-in-law and granddaughter, Izabel. We had not seen each another in over a year. Take out Chinese seemed like the perfect way to fill our bellies with a minimum amount of effort or interruption of our family social objectives. Upon consulting Yelp reviewers and looking at the map, we easily settled on Golden Gate. We were not looking for gourmet or exotic, just good old fashioned take out. 

If it isn't already obvious however, we were hungry. Our order included egg rolls, crab angels, fried dumplings, kun po shrimp, Mongolian beef, sweet and sour chicken, moo shu pork and both white and brown rice. Every choice was well received although the crab angels, dumplings and Mongolian beef received the highest marks. One person thought the moo shu was too runny and would have benefited from more pork. Another commented that the chicken could have had more veggies while a third remarked that they liked the way the chicken and its sauce were packaged separately, thus preventing the fried meat from getting soggy. All in all, this was a very satisfying meal, with tons of leftovers, and all for just $56.60. 

An excellent way to enjoy the first evening of our long weekend in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery. The staff was very pleasant , efficient , and fast. They arrived less then 20 minutes. The food was really good. We ordered pepper beef steak, egg soup , and spicy chicken fried rice(this was our request to make it spicy) everything was cooked to perfection . Definitely will be ordering from this place again. Highly recommend . Plus if you just want a night in and just want delivery . This is the place to call."}
{"text":"I've passed this place for years and years and always appreciated the old-school appearance--similar to all of those Chinese places I grew up with. The other day we finally got around to trying it.

I was not expecting genuine Chinese food, on the contrary, I was expecting old-school, Chinese-American stuff like chop-suey. In that, I was not disappointed. With a couple of exceptions, their menu could have come out of a Chinese restaurant in the Midwest circa 1970. 

I was, however, disappointed with the food, sadly. This is one of those places I was anxious to like--a real throwback and a survivor. But truly, the food was not good. In fact, my egg foo young tasted a little spoiled. I threw it away and ate the friend won tons they gave us. The rest of the food, according to my family, was not that bad, but nothing great. Even the spicy dishes tasted rather bland. 

I do love the look of the place, and the service was friendly and efficient. I hate to give it a two star review, but I can't muster any more than that right now."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place because of all the good reviews but ended up disappointed. The place is super cute and the staff were very friendly. Even the prices and portions were good. Because we were in a hurry my husband ordered to go, I got Kung Pao chicken and he got beef and broccoli. My chicken and veggies tasted old and microwaved. The steamed rice tasted watery, is how I can best describe it. My husband's broccoli was sour and he described his beef as being shiny. Needless to say we ended up throwing our food away."}
{"text":"When I got there, I waited for 10 mins to place an order. Couple of waitresses even looked at me while I was waiting and there was no acknowledgement.
I ordered Chicken Chowmein and when got home, found exact four little pieces of chicken. Not worth $10 after taxes.
I am sorry first impression was the last impression, not going back there again."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon the restaurant with my Fiance one night a few months ago, and have been back a few times since then.  

The food has always been fantastic, and the staff is awesome.  Meet and talked with the owner for a little bit last night, she was very nice.

This is the kind of place that you could easily drive past without thinking twice, but it is definitely worth the stop

I recommend the Crab Angels, and the House Special Chicken, both are really good"}
{"text":"One of the better Asian meals I have had here in the valley.  The egg drop soup is nearly perfect, the Kung Po Chicken is nice and spicy. My dinner date requested Orange Chicken (wasn't on the menu, but they gladly offered to make it). It was huge in proportion and well seasoned. 

The atmosphere is dark-smallish-old-school Chinese, and very clean.

The staff and service is impeccable.

The price is right! (less than $10 a person)"}
{"text":"This might be my new favourite Lunch time restaurant.  Very quick, fresh and so much food.  Great value."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Golden Gate since the 80's and well it has not changed at all.  I like that it brings back good memories every time.  The food is good and we order a couple of dishes to share.  I really like the crab angels and happy platter as well.  The little flaming grill on the happy latter still makes my eyes light up as when I was a child.  The hot tea is free and the service on water refills is spot on.  The place has no windows and is right next to a animal vet but don't let that bother you.  I recommend the Snow White chicken for sure.  I really love this place!  I hope it never closes!"}
{"text":"Im not sure if eating here one time is enough to give it a serious review, but I probably wont be returning. The food at Golden Gate wasnt bad, it just wasnt great. Do they use MSG? For me the sodium level was off the charts and the food lacked flavor. We tried the pineapple fried rice, moo goo gai pan and singapore noodles, none of which really stood out. On a happy note the people were very friendly."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the sesame chicken. Great experience and great food, will come back"}
{"text":"I'm staying at a friends condo and Henderson and I just wanted something quick and found this place on Yelp. Small Mom and Pop Chinese but good customer service and the food was good and not too salty. The lady in the front was sweet and gave me a small egg drop soup for free!"}
{"text":"Golden Gate isn't much to look at, both inside and out. They could certainly benefit from a makeover. Despite the appearance, they consistently cook some of the BEST Chinese food in the valley. The current owner is so sweet and friendly, and always makes it a point to walk around to tables and make sure the customers are happy with their experience. The tea is excellent and so are the egg rolls. It's also very difficult to find a restaurant that makes a good Egg Foo Young...Golden Gate's is superb! So is their Lemon Chicken, Kung Po, Moo Shoo, and pretty much everything else on the menu. There's only one other tiny problem with Golden Gate...they're located next to a sewer treatment center. Sometimes the smell on the walk just through the parking lot is unbearable. There's nothing they can do about the location, other than move, which isn't possible when you've been in the same spot for as many years as they have. Overall, Golden Gate is a Five star restaurant with one star interior design and one star one location. I hope to see them redesign in the future!"}
{"text":"Food was really tasty. The portions were an excellent size and each item came out hot and perfect.  My only problem was the super-rude girl at the counter. Other than that, for this type of cafe, definitely would've given them five stars."}
{"text":"What a find!!!  I drive by this place all the time and always mentally say \"humm Jess, you should try that place\" next time i am going to listen to my gut, because i was missing out! 

Inside is a very cute, cozy set up. everyone is super nice here. You get complimentary won ton chips and delicious Chinese tea when you get seated( this is pretty rare). The menu is large which lead us into gluttony...and people i am NOT ashamed because everything was derrrlicious :)

edamame, ribs, angel puffs(crab puff), garlic steak, lemon chicken, honey walmut shrimp (catching my breath)..sake..more hot tea..and then cookies and chocolate for dessert....yummmm

honestly i eat Chinese/Asian/Thai A LOT, and this was one of the best places i have came across in my quest for  great Asian food. 

why not five stars then you say?? well i am a fan of windows(none here), and i just can't hand out five stars like candy. But def a high four!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for take out.  Everything is always hot and delicious.  The broccoli in garlic sauce is delicious and the pork fried rice is amazing! 

The hot and sour soup is hit or miss.  The broth is always great but sometimes it's just loaded with nothing but tofu while other times it has all sorts of goodness!  

There isn't much on the menu I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good Chinese restaurant for years! Now we have found it. The food and service was excellent. The restaurant is comfortable and clean. We would recommend the Golden Gate to friends and family. You wont be disappointed in this place!"}
{"text":"FInally found good Chinese in Las Vegas.  Prices are excellent, too. Go out of their way to please...I wanted a particular item...they made it special for me.  Of course, language skills are always a problem with most ethnic restaurants...but for everything that matters, it is great food at a great price."}
{"text":"This place has been here for decades for a reason;  good food, good service, good price.  Classic old school Chinese, family run restaurant.  Lunch specials are superb and leave little left to be desired. Winning."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their food.  Their dishes were not prepared in the same 'ole \"Americanized Chinese\" food that's common around these parts.  I really enjoyed the sauces and the food in general was very good.  

It was a very interesting experience for us when the power went out as we were enjoying our soup!  The owners brought candles to our table and kept cooking our dishes (kitchen runs on gas) and bringing them out 1 by one!  We all dined by candlelight and I really enjoyed it.  lol

We had Sizzling Rice Soup, Egg Drop Soup, Dumplings, Mongolian Beef,  Sichuan (aka: Szechwan) Shrimp, and Crispy Duck with some VERY good white rice cooked perfectly... finished off with some fried banana. hao chi !!

The service was very good and friendly and we enjoyed some time chatting it up with the owner at the end."}
{"text":"So as I said before, this place has great garlic chicken. Delicious. I went back here last night and actually ate there (I've always gotten take out.. so this was a first). It is so worth it to eat there! They give you tea, which is good, and little fried wonton skins with red sauce... yum. So I got the wonton soup again and it was delicious just like the last times... I love their soup. Also, the BF and I decided we wanted to try their potstickers (So he has never liked potstickers, but they are my favorite part of chinese food. So I have not ordered potstickers cuz he won't share them with me... so about a month ago he decided he likes them, so now I can finally have them....yay!). Their potstickers are delicious!!!! They are all crispy on the bottom and still soft on the top and when you cut them open they have the juice on the inside, which is a sign of a good potsticker. The sauce also is good, not the best I've ever had, but very good. It is a bit spicy and has a few green onions, though more would be better. Then we had the wonderful garlic chicken. So the best part about eating in the restaurant is at the end they give you a little fried thing with powered sugar on top.... and in the middle there is banana!!!! So. Good. So go Golden Gate!"}
{"text":"My wife and I frequented this place more than 30 years ago when dating. We had favorite dishes that we never found an equaled anywhere in our travels. We returned to Cleveland to visit family and were amazed to find the resuraunt still open and operating under the same ownership. We ordered our favorites and again were suprised to find the food to taste just as we remember it. There are generous portions and lots of good memories to be made here. It might be worth a visit. I know you can't go home again but in regards to this place you can still get the same great tasting food you enjoyed years ago,"}
{"text":"Sue and company have run an outstanding restaurant for 23 years in the east valley. Terrific Chinese cuisine, in a very pleasant sit down setting. You will not find better service at any restaurant, anywhere. Not sure what \"pretty standard\" Chinese food means; but compared to several other east valley Asian fares, including the major chains, this place is superior. 
Plus, if you're going to gamble on taking out Moo Shu, the dish that is typically created and rolled at your table, well, you takes your chances.

If you like the occasional fried delicacy, try the Golden Gate shrimp; love it!

Spend your precious eat-out dollars at locally owned businesses."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food.  I think Chinese food can be hard to find, and I am very happy I found Golden Gate.  They also have a great lunch special-you get so much food for a great price!  We will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Once upon a time when I lived in Lakewood, I would frequent this establishment. Delivery available. Owners are very polite and take care of their customers to ensure their happiness with their purchase. 

Personally, I like their sweet and sour chicken above any other Chinese take-out. Food seems just a but more fresh and better quality than most places. Dining in is also a pleasant experience, its a dark, soothing atmosphere. 

If the mood strikes me right, I still come out here from the Gordon Sq. area where I stay now to indulge in some top notch (American-style)Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"Almost a perfect pre-experience. I did an order to go on a Monday lunch. The place was easy to find. As you get in, you're faced with this beautiful well decorated quiet ambience typical Oriental. 

I didn't have much time so I was hoping they were quick on the order. The lady immediately showed me lunch specials so here's what I got: 

- hot and sour soup...DELICIOUS!! For some reasons I got two of those (maybe I didn't express myself clearly);
- fried rice was also good and even more tasty with some soy sauce on it (eat it hot cause it tends to dry up);
- sweet and sour pork...and here's why I don't give 5 stars: it was very mushy and pretty tasteless even with additional sauce. Too bad. It's one of my favorite dishes of the Chinese cuisine. 

Service was quick. I would say they probably took less than 10 minutes. I would go back, just not for the sweet and sour pork."}
{"text":"First timers here, went here based on the good reviews. A big let-down. Maybe we just got unlucky like the other poster.

We just got take-out (garlic chicken and sweet & sour chicken) and sadly much of it was bone dry and very tough. Rice was ok, but that is just the side. We couldn't finish either of the chickens, and would have sent them back if we were eating sit down. The servers seemed very nice, but we can't justify going back if we can't eat the food ..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant! Order the crab angels for your appetizer and the Golden Gate shrimp for your meal. The best drink is the \"Scorpion,\" which is a punch that comes in a ceramic pineapple...which once made me lose all feeling in my legs. I promise you won't be disappointed! After your meal, they bring you a powdered wanton with banana inside. I love this place! The owner is so sweet and will stop by your table to thank you for your business. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"No acknowledgement for 10 min. I am literally standing at the front while I am typing this and waitresses keep walking by not even saying a word. How can you make eye contact with someone who is standing at the front of your restaurant and not say anything! It's not even busy.

Finally got acknowledged. 15 minutes later. What in the world..."}
{"text":"I have been going to Golden Gate Chinese for about 20 years now.  Always owned and run by \"Sue\" who is almost always there.  For over 20 years I have loved GG (we call it GG in my family...........all know what GG is.......Golden Gate)   Their chicken on a stick appetizer and stuffed shrimp are the best.  Great deal/amount of food on pupu platter.

I love their fried rice,
orange chicken.
honey shrimp
Mongolian beef
........it's all good at Golden Gate.

they do great lunch (taste and price) too that I recall."}
{"text":"LOVE IT! Before my husband and I moved to Laveen we used to eat here once a week! Now it's a semi-rare treat for us. The food is always delicious (way better than PF changs), especially the chow mein and garlic chicken. The prices are super low and the waitresses, while they don't always speak the best english, are always really helpful and great about refilling drinks. If you're in the area and feeling Chinese, this is definitely the place for you!"}
{"text":"Food was great, ordered take out Mongolian beef and pork fried rice. Both tasted great got my order in about 10 minutes.  My problem is I ordered food for me and my girlfriend, and for $11 you'd expect more than two servings of the Mongolian beef, I got more cabbage in the container than I got beef.  I guess I'll just order something other than the Mongolian beef next time. Hopefully this isn't the same with other dishes."}
{"text":"The best sweet & sour sauce!  I have yet to find another that compares.  I have coming to Golden Gate since 1998.    The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Disgusting. 

We ordered...

2 egg rolls. : G-R-O-S-S.

Crab Angels. : freaking inedible. 

Yushang Lamb. : Lamb was tender, but my husband vomited onto his plate when he bit into a Chinese Hair. 

Twice cooked pork. : Flavorless

Chicken Chow mein. : large lo mein noodles that were lacking flavor. 

Pork Fried Rice: the best item we order, and most tasty. However, after hair was found in the lamb I immediately threw all dishes in the trash.

Beef N Broccoli: Flavorless and gross. 

This meal was anything BUT good. 

$56 down the drain, and we will never dine here again. We suggest you don't either!

{"text":"Love love love this place! Friendly and attentive staff. Always great food. Always clean. I've been coming here for years, and their crab angels are the best!!! Thanks for staying consistent!"}
{"text":"So many good reviews about this place, but the food was so mediocre and service was not all that great."}
