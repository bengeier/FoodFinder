{"text":"Just another dive gaming bar tucked in the corner of a small strip shopping center. Nothing special at all inside or out. Very dark and smokey mostly frequented by neighborhood locals. Drinks are relatively inexpensive. There is no food which really sucks sometimes. They allow outside food to be brought in. The service is really spotty. Some of the bartenders like to hang in the corner chatting up with the regulars which makes you have to literally walk over waving your arms to get another drink. All in all nothing special at all."}
{"text":"yes...i used to go to this place they now call a bar...or pub....well...since the economy crunch has hit...please dont bother going there...they will hound you to play max bets before you are seated for more than a minute....COMPS?you want comps????at tee shots???NO friggin way...you wont get em...even though they need the business more than they think...forget about it...maybe its because i won so much money from them in the past by playing 50 cent bets as opposed to their MUCH DEMANDED dollar bets now...that place went straight to the crapper...never go there again..."}
{"text":"The best bartenders in Vegas period! Old School feel with the best service. Pool table darts great music."}
{"text":"Just to clarify--Tee Shots does not currently have a kitchen. However, EXCELLENT bartenders provide superb service and pour a drink in which I can actually taste the vodka! The folks who gave bad reviews in past years must have been sour grapes. Yes, it is a neighborhood locals place. And the bartenders are more like friends with the regulars, but I have never seen anyone go thirsty or be given preferential treatment. And I am new. Yes, it is smoky, but no more than any other drinking/gaming establishment that does not serve food. Speaking of the food, while it does not have a kitchen (due to the smoking law), mention you are hungry and one of the friendly bartenders will likely offer to order you a hot dog, pizza or sandwich from the Chevron in the same strip mall. And they will bring it right to your seat. Regarding the gaming...you get lots of play for your dollar, and I personally think their Gambler's Bonus comps are as good as any rewards program. I've hit four relatively big payouts in the few months I have been here. I do believe in tipping well for good service, so these ladies do get our tips, but that is just the way of reciprocity! Tee Shots is a pleasantly divey neighborhood joint where I have had some of my best times since being in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to visit Tee Shots after having passed by it about a million times over the years.  On one fine and chilled out morning I thought I would take the GF and go out exploring, visiting  a new place to eat and drink.

Upon walking in the place was sort of dead but that did not bother us as we thought we would  relax, enjoy a beer (or two) and grab a bite to eat.  

The bartender greeted us, gave took our beer order, gave us a menu and that was basically it. She bailed on us after what appeared to be regulars popped in. After what amounted to ten minutes she never returned and left us hanging be fore she returned.

Finished up the one beer and chose to forgo the food order and finish the one beer and leave.

I can become a a \"regular\" too!  I don't need a lot of love,  hell..you don't even really need to like me (much), just show me some respect as a patron of your establishment."}
{"text":"First Tee Shots Bar & Grill no longer serves food, but it is okay to take food in and yes they have gaming.

I have been going here for the better part of a year on a weekly basis.  This place has become my third home it's my cheers.  The people are friendly, the bartenders are awesome.  They have darts, pool and a weekly shuffle board tournament on Wednesday's that start at 12:30am(Thursday).

If you want to go somewhere where the bartenders will remember your name and actually talk to you for a while this is the place for you.  You want to chill and just have a good drink this is the place."}
{"text":"This place is a dump. No doubt. It is the opposite of bougie. It's is the anti cool spot. It's dark and dingy. I asked what kind of scotch they had and the bartender nicely told me they were not a fancy place and the selection was limited.   My buddy and I ordered jack and Coke's and they were strong. The drinks were 5 bucks each. Stiff and cheap, just like me. Then we played pool. They have darts which illuminated this dimly lit place.  The bartender gave hugs to some regulars. There were about 6 people there on a Saturday night. Just because this place is a dump doesn't mean that it can't get 4 stars in my book, it just can't 5"}
{"text":"Love Tee Shots!  The bartenders are all super nice and the place has a nice local bar feel.  They have a great selection of music and several tv's to watch games on.  Stop by, play a game of pool, maybe some video poker,  have something to eat and have fun chatting with the diverse people who go there.  One of my favorite \"off strip\" places to hang."}
{"text":"Wonderful establishment. Staff and gaming are top notch. Taco place next door for food. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I love my neighborhood bar!  I've been hanging out here for three years and have met some great friends.  It may seem kinda lackluster to the outsider, but what other place has a jukebox where Type O Negative, Dropkick Murphys, Hanson, Slayer, and the Eagles all gets played in the same 30 minutes.  Not that all of that is a good thing, but it's funnier than hell when all the chi-chi girls get up and line dance to Hanson in a drunken slither and then try to headbang to Slayer.  Let's not forget the new dartboards and darts league!  And Devin, Adam, Marisol, and Mariah are the friendliest bartenders in town!"}
