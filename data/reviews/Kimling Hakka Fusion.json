{"text":"If you want authentic Indian Chinese Hakka food this is a good place to go. It's a family run business and the owners are actually Hakka Chinese from India. They know how to cook. Being Hakka I know what good Hakka food is"}
{"text":"Location: South-East corner on Birchmount and Lawrence, in a plaza.   Yay! Awesome food.  I highly recommend checking out this place. The plaza, to the Elitist and Royalty Wannabe might be unappealing, but the restaurant inside, while having that older feel (They're all like that!)  is actually pleasant, and clean. Again, only in Scarborough will you get Hakka Chinese food like this.    The lady server (seemed like the owner) was nice, attentive, and knew English well.  She has a certain charm to her.    I read the reviews here, and decided to try it for a mid-week anniversary dinner.  I definitely concur.      The Manchurian soup is awesome.  Familiar but different.  Kind of like a egg drop soup, but with shrimp and other ingregients, not as 'gooey', spicier, beefier but a tad zesty taste.  See menu I scanned for prices and sizes.   The other dish we ordered was Garlic Green Beans.  Nicely cooked, not too soggy, good texture. Plump and juicy.    Masala Beef was nice and peppery, with the masala taste and spice.  Served with vegetables.    And finally, the Chili chicken.  Almost like bits of fried chicken, with gravy on it.  This was the tastiest chili chicken I've had.  I still have to try other local, less known 'Hakka' restaurant staples (I have tried: Lucky's, Frederick's, Chung Moi, new on on Ellesmere and Markham)   This one, I still crave.  Light, but crispy, not too salty, good spice (not too spicey though).   Everything we ordered tasted fresh to order.  I recently had Lucky's Chili chicken and it tasted like it was sitting around for awhile, cooked in a big batch, and sitting under a heat lamp before being microwaved or quickly re-heated.    Also, I didn't need much Hot Sauce at all (normally a sauce monster), because the food itself was just that good.    We will definitely recommend this to friends, or take them here for any casual lunch/dinner gatherings.    I also just noticed they serve Lobster and Crab.  Will definitely have to try that sometime too. Try it and give the 'established' Hakka places a break (which I think they sometimes take things for granted), by checking out this hidden gem of a place.  Kimling Indian Chinese Restaurant."}
{"text":"Great Hakka Chinese food. The manchurian soup is to die for. Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"As Hakka Chinese myself, I can't recommend this place enough. Great Hakka cuisine located in the middle of the city. Only seconds away from the DVP. Two words: Manchurian Soup. Probably the best I've ever had! Spicy and flavourful. Another goodie is the chilli chicken. You can order them dry or with gravy. I recommend getting this dish with gravy, served over a bed of rice. So good.  A traditional Hakka Chinese noodle dish worth trying is fung mi mein (stir fried noodle with molasses soy sauce). A true staple in my household. If you love Chinese, Indian or trying new and delicious cusine, visit Kimling. So good, you'll be bragging about it!"}
{"text":"I love a great hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant.  That kind of secret one with amazing food that you share with friends, but only on a need-to-know basis.  this is one of those kind of places, but spicier!  I went this past Saturday for lunch with my son.  We both loved our dishes, He Wonton noodles, me crispy pepper fish.  We shared a delicious Hot and Sour soup.    Good food, really good value, friendly people.  Go there."}
{"text":"Highly disappointing food. Chilly Chicken ,the national dish of India was hard as stone. They used old chicken ( I hope it was chicken ) and it wasn't even spicy .. It was between bland and mild.  The noodles were pathetic . They tasted like shoelaces ( shoelaces must be tasting that way I am imagining )  Giving it a 2 because the Veg Manchurian was decent . Although I would never buy that again . The fried rice was ok. If you are a bachelor and stay near by may be you can try eating here once in a while . Food is affordable but make sure you choose wisely.   If you are married ... As Ryan Gosling said in one of his movies \"rise above the GAP\" ...  Get a life . Eat somewhere else . You love your spouse right ? don't feed him/her all this .. Go cook at home , but a bottle of wine  instead."}
{"text":"I don't understand. The food was tasteless. And I mean tasteless. I've been to many places and the food always has some sort of flavor. Not here though. The service was good."}
{"text":"5 Star food & service! The best Indian-Chinese food in the GTA -- we've been to many Indo-Chinese restaurants & can vouch for it. Susan, the owner, is very friendly & gives a lot of personal attention. The vegetarian Manchurian balls are crispy on the outside & soft inside. The spicy pepper tofu was delicious, the veggie hakka noodles outstanding! We'll certainly go back with friends."}
{"text":"Was In the area and tried this place out based on recommendations.  I just had the chilli chicken to go.  It was above average...my only gripe was it was a bit salty.   I would come back and try other things."}
{"text":"best dry chilli squid in city,they know how to deepfry....and how.lovely lady owner is always there,their hakka green beans are to die for as well, everything good always,sawa  bad review for them from a us guest,too bad they had a substellar experrience,ive eaten there countless times and its worth a drive to scarberia.mmmmm love da hakka............."}
{"text":"Simply the best hakka food and the nicest people running the place. Best hakka chow mein and chili chicken. Service is quick and attentive."}
{"text":"I wanted and was craving some Hakka food yesterday. I came on this site to see what was the closest to my house and was happy I found this place. Hakka food is a fusion between Indian spices on Chinese cuisine.  I ordered the Chicken Pakora, Chili Chicken on Rice, and the Beef Hakka Chow Main. All three dishes were delicious, Full of flavour, big portion size, and fulfilled the craving I had.  The Place is a tiny restaurant. I phoned in advance to place the order and the lady on the phone said 20 mins. I arrived on time as this was my first time going there so I wanted to make sure I didn't miss it. I didn't even have to tell her my name she came out of the back with my order. She was friendly, and had a very positive attitude towards her.. She quoted me a price over the phone which was exactly the same..   I will return here when i'm in the mood to have some spice in my cuisine.."}
