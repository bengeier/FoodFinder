{"text":"Best flank steak I've ever tasted!  Done pink and just right.  Served with perfect green beans and frites.  This looks like the best item on their Summerlicious menu.  It's my first time at this restaurant and likely won't be my last.  The grilled calamari with salad is good although could be more \"grilled\".  Dessert of Apple crisps was too sweet and gooey to my liking.  Service was okay although server could be more attentive - gave me the wrong first course, gave my dinner companion yogurt in her gazpacho and ice cream in her dessert in spite being told not to.  But it was quickly corrected.

And yes, I like the quiet.  It's great to be able to have some dinner conversation for a change!"}
{"text":"I just went here for our office holiday lunch and it was really, really bad.  
I ordered the Nicoise salad which is a pretty standard thing, I didn't think it was possible to screw such a simple thing up actually, boy was I wrong!
I wish I had taken a pic of what they presented me with but I sent it away too quickly to get a chance.  The plate they put in from of me consisted of big pieces of potato, steamed broccoli, cucumber (yes, cucumber mixed in with hot  steamed veggies), pieces of tuna and on the very top half of an omelette.  Yep. HALF an OMELETTE!  (some else at my table ordered the same thing and got the other half lol) When I told the waiter this was not what I ordered, and not as their own menu described it , he told me this is how \"they make it\", and that they were out of a lot of the things. Oh boy. In hindsight I actually feel embarassed for a \"chef\" that would serve such a thing and think it was acceptable.  They were having an omelette special that day so he obviously just didn't feel like taking the time to hard boil an egg or two and I suspect all the rest was just stuff they wanted to get rid of.  Also, someone else at my table ordered a brownie which I tasted and it  was gross and dry. 

Bottom line, don't go here ever if you like good food."}
{"text":"Fantastic place.  Been there many times and the food is always delicious.  Favourite thing I've ever had there is the lamb sausage - just amazing.  Staff is friendly, atmosphere is nice.  Great place to go for a fancier night out."}
{"text":"I don't quite understand the bad reviews. Yes the menu is slightly uninspired but it's always delicious! I've been here about 5 times and there is always great wine, salads, mains, etc. 
Last visit I had the Rack of lamb. The lamb was perfect!! I think it was about $25 which is pricey but reasonable for Lamb...and with amazing mashed potatoes...though the greens it came with were way too salty. 
The salads are great and other apps are excellent as well. The atmosphere is very, how shall I say, \"old\" rosedale. Lol but it's very comfy and cute. Servers are hit and miss. I've had some that are decent and knowledgable and others that were kinda odd. Owners/managements seems quite nice. 
I'll definitely be back. They keep things pretty simple yet decadent and I dig it!"}
{"text":"Simple food done well. Nothing fancy here, but everything is always cooked to perfection. The sardines app is absolutely one of the best fish dishes you'll ever eat."}
{"text":"Worst service I've experienced in some time! The waiter was rude, ignored us and was petulant. Too many stellar establishments in TO to go back.

Be careful Bistro - you are unlikely to attract a new generation of customers with this poor attitude."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of Bistros usually cos there are many that neither do justice to the wine nor the food. A friend suggested this restaurant in this sleepy retirement home neighborhood. Not a lot going on around the restaurant.
The food, however was nothing short of mind-blowing. I got to share with my friends on the table, and we tried the mussels, the lamb shank, the cornish hen and a steak together. Every single dish was cooked to perfection and flavored perfectly. There was no overdose of cheese or spices.
The wine pairing was good too, though a bit priced. But the food compensates in pricing as well - don't remember having a lamb shank for $25 - especially this tasty.
This would be 5-star except for the boring neighborhood. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"After Bachata at Babaluu in nearby Yorkville, we met up with Chef Benett at Brownes Bistro after close for a specially prepared meal that blew our taste buds away.  His specially prepared liver (that was easily the best liver I've ever had), ice blanched vegetables that had so much flavor I couldn't remember the last time I enjoyed eating broccoli this much, not to mention his melt-in-your-mouth mashed potatoes.  I don't know he does it, but he consistently out does himself every time.  The meal was paired beautifully with his house favorite Kenwood Merlot.  Do yourself a favour and check this place out; and tell Benett about this review, you will get a little extra something something. :)"}
{"text":"This is a neighbourhood gem. So nice to be able to walk in and have a great meal when you don't feel like cooking. Service is always friendly, food quite good. Music not too loud, which I appreciate in my older age!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner one evening with my family and had the angel hair pasta dish (Angel hair with grilled chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, red onion, roasted garlic in a light olive oil-herbed tomato sauce). The dish was very good; however, I found the sauce to be a bit too salty for my liking. 

Service was good and the waiters were knowledgeable and attentive. It is a lovely, sophisticated, and relaxed restaurant that caters a bit more to the older generation."}
{"text":"I was here for summer licious. It was OK. Very mature, grown up place to go. I asked for a cocktail and the waiter said \"we don't make strange cocktails here\", apparently all they had were wine and rum and coke."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. I didn't love our waitress, rushing us to order. No cocktail list. Main courses did not come out all together so we sat and waited. I had lamb shank and it was alright, not as soft and braised as i had expected, and I didn't care the it's sides of mash potatoes and yam and lentils of some sort all soft and mushy no contrast in texture, I would have wanted green beans. The grilled octopus was small portioned and a little mushy. Not sure if I would visit here again. Difficult street parking and location in middle of nowhere on Yonge."}
{"text":"This is a gem tucked away in a good neighbourhood. It was quite crowded on a Monday night, and while there were mostly elderly people, I found the place great for a quiet evening with good service and food. Excellent service - attentive without being obtrusive. Food - we all enjoyed the dishes wed had ordered and the deserts were fantastic too. The spiced lamb sausage dish was good as was the pasta with pesto. The wine selection was good. We wanted a rose wine, and while it wasn't on the menu, they had a couple of bottles tucked away, which were great. Fine dining without the hefty pricetag, and not very hoity-toity. The only reason for the four stars is the size of the portions - they were a little small for the young men in our group."}
{"text":"My son and I visited BB this evening because I purchased a restaurant coupon and hadn't been to Brownes in 15 + years.

It says on the coupon to present it to the waiter upon arrival which I did.  His first comment is \"We hate these things\".  Well thanks for the warm welcome. Bad start.

I ordered the venison because the same waiter told me that we won't be disappointed. I ordered it medium rare as that same waiter suggested.

The venison came shortly thereafter and it was probable the WORST meat I've had in years. It was overcooked and was well done NOT medium rare and it tasted like liver, which tells you about the quality of meat.

I called the owner over and he looked at the venison and said 'This is no good\" took it away and brought me a different entree which I agreed to.

After we finished our meal no one asked us how the second attempt was and when we paid we didn't get a thank you nor a come again.

Wow what ever happened to charm, or 'I'm sorry for that' or some regret that our evening was totally ruined with a combination of poor service, inedible food and I just don't care attitude.

Very poorly done gentlemen.  My only question is how have you remained in business?"}
