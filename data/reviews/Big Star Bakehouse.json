{"text":"While in Calgary visiting a friend, we happened upon this 100% dedicated gluten free bakery by chance this afternoon.  While heading into town to hunt down some GF poutine at Big Cheese, we literally parked directly across from Big Star Bakehouse and their 100% dedicated Gluten Free Bakery sign immediately caught our eye.

We headed on in and it was a mecca of gluten free goodness.  I over bought, as usual, but their goods were, well...too good to be missed out on.  Their lemon loaf was phenomenal, the vanilla cupcake with lemon curd filling and strawberry butter cream frosting is a must have.  I could not have created a more perfect treat for my taste buds.  I also sampled the baguette, yes you read that correctly, GLUTEN FREE BAGUETTE which is crusty on the outside and soft on the inside.  Waiting to be tried is the cheese bun and Italian loaf bun, but each looks and feels equally as yummy as the baguette.  I'm saving those for dinner.

If you're in Calgary this is a must stop if you are gluten free.  If you're not gluten free, you'll be just as impressed with their goods.

Well done Big Star Bake House!"}
{"text":"Really good gluten free dinner buns and cheese buns :)"}
{"text":"I've had goodies from this place twice and I am blown away. This place is 100% gluten free and it tastes AMAZING! I had an apple cinnamon muffin, a carrot cake muffin with cream cheese icing of course and the best - the chocolate cupcake... not sure what the icing was but it tasted like a mccain deep dish chocolate cake (from what i can remember). The only thing is that you have to go early or else they will be sold out of almost everything.
Whether you eat gf or not, I highly recommend this place. You won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"How I didn't know this spot existed is beyond me! Although I must say I was slightly disappointed. I went with the carrot cake, as it was one of my fave cakes when I was able to eat cake, and I have to say, it didn't measure up to what I remember. The cake was a little dry, super crumbly and didn't have the spice kick you find in carrot cake. 

The mini coffee was pretty tasty, I'm just not into these type of baked goods anymore, as it's been years since I've ate them. 

There is still other goodies I would try."}
{"text":"I visited Big Star Bakehouse for the first time, and was pleasantly surprised.  I bought a little carrot cake to take to a BBQ - it's nice that they have smaller portions.  I like to take these to events, so I can still have dessert without worrying about gluten.  The carrot cake was moist and delicious!

I also tried a cheese bun - I wouldn't buy them again, as I found them dry (the typical texture you think of when you think about GF food).  Other than that, I enjoyed coming here and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Over the years, I've come to enjoy some homemade gluten-free dishes. Not because I have an intolerance, but rather I have a best friend with an intolerance. One year I even went so far as to bake her a gluten-free birthday cake (which she reminded of the other day. It tasted really good the day of, but somehow it turned to mush over the course of the weekend. I don't think it's supposed to do that!)

Anyway, at the time, gluten friendly places were hard to come by round these parts. But now, it's getting pretty easy to find options for the wheatless... like Big Star Bakehouse!

I popped in this afternoon to see what this place is all about. While there aren't rows upon rows of goods, there was at least variety in what I could choose from a couple of different kinds of cupcakes and cookies to loaves of bread and and even individual coffee cakes. 

I came out with a bag of gingersnaps and two cupcakes. See, the best friend just moved to Calgary AND started a new job. I think she deserves a treat that won't revert back to mush. I may have already eaten one of the gingersnaps and a cupcake. Shhh... don't tell! She doesn't need to know I couldn't wait. :p.

I hear many a-person talking about how bought gluten-free things generally aren't very good. Mind you, these comments generally come from folks who've had the allergy awhile and long since given up on commercial GF food. I think I should start bringing them cookies from Big Star. And cupcakes. They're not cheap ($5.00 for 4 cookies and $4.00 per cupcake), but I'd totally eat those again. 

Next, I'm testing out the bread."}
{"text":"are you shitting me?! that carrot cake! I don't even LIKE carrot cake, but I went mental for this carrot cake! SO GOOD! I can't wait to go back, and I'm kicking myself for not stopping in sooner!"}
