{"text":"Me and my friends thought it was A-Okay also. The food was slightly expensive and the food was okay!"}
{"text":"We ordered online, took 2 hours for delivery. Our office was only 15 mins away from Markham ThaiOneOn. I don't get why it took so long?? When the food arrived, the delivery guy told us that ordering by phone would have been a lot quicker. What is the point of having the website then? Not only that, we realized they forgot to give us the salad which we have ordered online. So we called, waited another 1.5 hours -still no delivery - we were very frustrated as it was already 4 30 PM (time to get off work - still no salad)therefore we called to cancel order to get a refund. The owner asked us to call another number to get a refund because we ordered it online which was ridiculous . So another option they gave us was to go to their store to pick up the money. Which was even ludicrous!!! Not only did they missed our order and super late delivery, no incentives were given even though we asked. I will never order from them again. Worse customer service ever. Giving them One star is too good for them."}
{"text":"Ordered take out a few days ago. Delivery time was pretty swift.
We ordered the classic pad Thai, and it was a waste of money. Upon the first taste, the pad Thai was just drowning in sauce, which was way too sour from the usual pad Thai I've been eating.  Honestly will not be giving this place another chance."}
{"text":"The service was ok but food was really bad! Skewers served to us was rock hard. The Thai basil beef was a disappointment too because the meat was tough!

When the bill came, I had a little talk with the server and she was kind enough to take out the skewer from it. 

Not sure if this place is always like this or just the time that I went. But if you ask me, I will not come back again."}
{"text":"Thought the curry pad thai was good. Lots of comments complaining that it had too much sauce.. but I personally like it less dry. 

Hate the parking in the plaza though. Impossible to find a parking spot."}
{"text":"I have only been to this restaurant a couple of times. All I can say is the portions are HUGE, however, I wish the food tasted better. 
I have had great thai food before, and this place just doesn't do it for me.
I have never seen the restaurant busy, so I not sure if that is the reason for it always looking spotless, but it also gives the sense that it always \"just opened.\" Not sure if that is a good thing."}
{"text":"It's ok food not everything on the menu is great but for a chain restaurant it's good the prices are maybe a little high but if you are going to eat here I suggest the mango chicken or coconut mango chicken with coconut rice. 
The spring rolls and mango salad are also good."}
{"text":"Although this place may have been a hit in earlier years, it sure as hell ain't anymore. There's a reason why people don't come here anymore, and I could tell when my parents and I walked into this restaurant. This was our first time at the restaurant. 

We walk in and there's literally no one inside except us, the waitress, and another couple who left shortly after. 

We waited about 25 minutes for our food, even though there was nobody in the restaurant. We ordered the sauteed spinach, red curry chicken, and curry pad thai. The food may look appetizing in big portions, but it tastes horrendous, especially the red curry, which we barely finished. So whatever you do, DON'T get the red curry. I don't even know what they put in that, because it tasted incredibly gross. I was extremely disappointed because green / red curry is usually the best thing on a thai menu. 

The only thing that edible would be the curry pad thai, but that is literally just chinese curry and pad thai mixed together. We also ordered the sauteed spinach, which is drenched in a coconut milk, curry sauce? Not sure, but that was OK, even though we only wanted spinach and they put a whole bunch of other vegetables in it too. 

If you're looking for an authentic thai place to eat, this is definitely not your spot lol! This place is far from authentic, and the workers / chefs are not thai. And, if you're even thinking about coming here turn your car around and go somewhere else. McDonald's makes better food than this place!"}
{"text":"Service = 8/10
Atmosphere = 3/10
Pad Thai = 3/10
Basil Chicken = 7/10
There wasn't anyone else in the restaurant but the 5 of us...and that was from 6:30 to approx.7:30.  But looked like lots of phone in orders.  The pad Thai had an ok flavour...but it there was way too much sauce...it was more like a \"sloup\".

Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I often order from this location of Thai One On.  However in the recent past the quality has deteriorated to the extent that one will not be able to eat some of the dishes.  50% of the food ordered yesterday was to be junked since it was not edible. When the soup was tasty, the coconut rice was smelling of rotten coconut, and chicken wings were burnt (probably once cooked and kept in the fridge and then again deep fried).  Considering the quality we did not even eat the PadThai that was ordered.
When called, the response was that they will call us back as they were busy.  However no call was returned.  Probably due to the guilt of supplying stale food."}
{"text":"Ordered
1. Spicy Seafood Salad - totally not what I was expecting.  Perhaps this was their version but I've had this dish many times (in Thailand) and the one we had tonight was pretty awful.  Not sure why they added a creamy mayo-type sauce to it but that's not how it's made!
2. Pad Thai with Chicken & Shrimp - super saucy and way too sweet!  
3. Mango Chicken - was the best out of the 3 dishes (considering the other 2 failed).

Would I return: NO."}
{"text":"Definitely has gone down in quality.
The pad thai is just a pile of noodles drenched in what tastes like ketchup. Got it with beef and the beef was extremely rubbery.
The glass noodles, while flavourful, again had too much sauce and the noodles were mushy in texture.
Probably, I am sad to say, one of the worst restaurant meals I have had in awhile. If they keep this up I am not sure how much longer this place will stay in business."}
{"text":"It's not amazing Thai food, it satisfies a craving. The atmosphere is decent and the service is usually good - even in big groups.

We ate here two times since my last review- both more out of convenience. Sometimes the pad Thai can be a hit/miss being too 'curry powder like'--- other times it's fine-- sometimes is soupy. 

I give a one star theoretically for my last experience where we went at 9:25 on a Friday to be turned away at an empty restaurant saying they close at 10:00 --- I looked at my watch confused. If they sent the staff home just say it-- that's fine. Don't keep the lights on and doors unlocked when I come half hour before the closing time."}
{"text":"There are a few locations but I'm referring to the Markham location. I give this  restaurant an average rating overall. I tried the food on two different occasions. First the good:

- The food portions are huge. 
- You get a free Pad Thai if you spend more than $30.
- They have home delivery.
- Good Pad Thai, and pineapple fried rice and spicy basil chicken.
- Reasonable prices.

And the not so good:
- Food is a little greasy.
- Restaurant interior dated.
- The spicy dishes are never very spicy
- The restaurant was empty both times I visited (which always gives me concern)

Bottom line - it's an OK place, food is not bad (but not great). If you have a thai craving and in the area, Thai One On will do the job."}
{"text":"This review is based on take-out from this location. I don't care much for the physical restaurant.

In terms of take-out, it's pretty reliable and the portions are good value. For $40-50 you can get a lot of food, and you can usually get free spring rolls or pad thai.

The devil chicken/beef is not quite as spicy as I'd like, but there is a bit of a kick to it.

I really like the chicken fired rice here as the  spiced used are great. I also really like the chicken pad thai here. It's a bit greasy, but I still find it tasty."}
{"text":"This review is specific to my take out order.

It was my first time ordering from Thai One On, and will likely be the last time as well. 

My order consisted of Lemongrass Coconut soup, Calamari, and Chicken Satay.

Lemongrass Coconut Soup: 
On the plus side, it was loaded with mushrooms and chicken. However, I found the soup much too sour. 

Calamari: Based on the description in the menu, I was expected just a light coating of spices. The description is inaccurate as they are also dipped in batter. Although the batter wasn't heavy, the oil they used had a slightly bitter taste to it, which indicates that the oil is heavily reused. 

Chicken Satay: ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Saying the chicken was overdone is a gross understatement. Both sticks were completely charred! I nibbled on the uncharred side (which was still dry and over-cooked) and threw out half of the meat as it was completely unedible. I was insulted that they would even think to serve a dish of such a low calibre to any customer! 

All I can say is NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Came during dinner time on a weekend and it was eerily empty when we came in... 

We ordered:
- green curry with lamb - we ordered 2 rotis on the side for this dish. The curry was meh... it lacks a strong flavour. Slight curry and coconut flavour but ultimately bland. 
- Mango chicken - flavour was OK but anything saucy can be OK. Chicken was on the dry side and the mango pieces were beyond the ripeness.... 
- mango sticky rice dessert - we were already full when we ordered this but this was good. 

Service was good, only one server but we were the only one in the restaurant for the whole duration.... 
Probably won't return and could get something better in a foodcourt."}
{"text":"I had been to this location of Thai One On before but that had probably been more than 10 years ago.  Nothing had changed inside the restaurant and by the looks of it, since they hadn't changed anything up, it looked rather drab and old inside when compared to other restaurants these days that have a more refreshed decor.

We were the only customers dining in on this Monday evening.  Even when we arrived to the restaurant and walked to a table, that was only when the automatic lights flickered on.

Instead of actual restaurant menus that they had before, they now only use their take-out paper menu as the dine-in one.  We found that telling that they cater much more to take-out orders rather than dine-in customers.

We decided on and placed our orders quickly and the food arrived momentarily too.  I found it a bit awkward to be the only ones dining in the restaurant.  There was no background music at all which meant all of our conversations could be heard by the staff if they really paid attention to us.  There was a TV showing CP24 News but there was no sound coming from it.  I really think all restaurants should have some type of music or soundtrack in the background.  It makes it a lot less awkward for their customers and makes for a more cozy dining environment.

Anyway, we ordered the Coconut Mango Chicken and Pineapple Red Curry Shrimp and an extra bowl of rice to share.  This was the perfect portion since the two dishes were actually quite substantial!

The Coconut Mango Chicken was a plate of deep fried chicken with coconut, fresh mango, baby corn, and sweet peppers.  There was a lot of chicken indeed!

The Pineapple Red Curry Shrimp was a bowl of shrimp with red curry sauce, pineapple, snow peas, sweet peppers, and fresh basil leaves.  This dish already came with one bowl of steamed rice.  I was really impressed with how many shrimps there were in the bowl and also how firm and silky the shrimps were!  The red curry sauce wasn't too spicy and was milky in texture.

I liked that the three of us shared two dishes and we only had to pay around $12 or so for our dinner.  It was a good and affordable meal."}
{"text":"I haven't had much experience with Thai restaurants, but this place has me sold.  We ordered the Classic Pad Thai, Coconut Vegetables and Crab Curry.  I would definitely pass on the coconut vegetables as it seemed bland to me.  This could've been in part because the Pad Thai and Crab Curry (especially the crab curry) had rich flavours and overpowered the vegetables.  The Crab Curry was good, but they could probably do better on plating, as it came in a bowl and seemed more like a stew than anything else.  It also came solo, no side dishes. You have to pay extra for rice as an accompaniment, which we passed on since we ordered Pad Thai.  With that said, I would come back again."}
{"text":"Was tasty delivery about a hour . For 60 bucks I expected more food . Probably won't order again from them . Also the noodle dish ingot was so spicy and in ad said nothing about being hot like that . And i can't eat spicy so ya was a bit mad . Was the soy glass noodle dish."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on Wednesday, July 15, 2009 with my friends, and I had a pretty good experience. The tables are kind of small, so if you're coming here with people who are a little taller, you might be better off not sitting in a booth, if that is possible at all!

We ordered a green mango salad, green curry chicken, beef devil, thai basil tofu, and Thai One On beef fried rice. The food came pretty quickly, within 10-15 minutes or so, and it was sweat-inducing. The Thai One On beef fried rice came after the green mango salad, and the rice itself wasn't so bad but the beef had some good kick behind it. The beef devil seemed less spicy, but it seemed the vegetables held a little more spice than their meat counterparts. The thai basil tofu and the green curry chicken were the least spicy of the four main entrees, and I enjoyed the most because they were delicious and the right amount of kick.

Overall, the experience was good, good food with great service, but I felt that it was a little pricey. It worked out to just about $60 for four people with a tiny amount of left overs, which isn't too bad. The green curry chicken was a bit small for the price, but it was pretty dang good.

Hope you guys enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst Thai food I've had within the GTA.. or probably ever. We ordered the veggie pad Thai and green curry and were beyond disappointed with both. 

Firstly, the pad Thai was overly sauced - it was way too salty and sour. Nothing about it was authentic or even tasty for that matter. Some of the vegetables had a weird disinfectant taste to it too, yuck. 

The rice for the green curry was next level disgusting. It was 100% leftover rice and it was hard and clumpy. The actual curry was again very salty, and it was just not good. 

The portions here are big, but what good is that when the food is horrendous? Also, the place reeks of grease - it smelt like they've been using a 30 year-old vat of unchanged canola oil. Never again will I visit Thai One On nor would I recommend it to anyone, unless they are awful people."}
{"text":"Been ordering takeout from this location for a number of years. In the last couple of years or so they have changed some of their recipes ; while the food is still good,  it's no longer great.  And it's become very pricey.  You will easily pay double for your takeout or dine in food than you would at other Thai restaurants.  The curry pad Thai noodles are my favourite dish.  The chicken devil is delightful. Stay away from the chicken wings tho,  I've had them twice and each time they were dry and burned with no flavour ( being a very expensive appetizer, it was quite disappointing).   The service is very friendly. Not sure I'll be going back however  unless I have extra money that I feel like giving away rather than ordering Thai from a more reasonably priced establishment."}
{"text":"This place is very dark on the outside so I wouldn't have even noticed until my friends hubby suggested us to try. So we did and we didn't like the taste of almost all things we ordered. 

We ordered the Thai One On platter, red curry, green curry, pineapple fried rice assuming these are probably signature dishes from Thailand. I should have yelped it before sitting down note to self..

We upgraded our rice to coconut rice with the curry. The platter came with mainly fried items and I knew it was fried with old oil...everything was dark and hard in colour and texture..even the shrimp chips were stale (minus 1 star) 

The pineapple fried rice looked oily and wet, it wasn't served in a pineapple and didn't have pineapple pieces in it so does that beat the purpose? We ordered that for the kids expecting it wouldn't be spicy but it ended up being spicy....that wasn't stated on the menu and (minus 1 star) 

Red and green curry was super sweet and not spicy, the colour and taste wasn't anything close to curry (minus 1 star),  there was only one server for the whole restaurant and we were not really being attended to as she had to do everything herself. 


All in all, will not be back....Thai Basil still my favorite Thai place!"}
{"text":"Very helpful staff and I really want to give them a better review but the food is a total disappointment. I ordered rolls which tasted like they were the frozen kind. The hot and sour soup was bland and watery. The rice was substandard and the food was similarly so as well as being tasteless. sorry guys...you need a new cook"}
{"text":"Quoting another yelper, this place \"is a solid meh\".

The food here is consistent. You don't have to worry about dishes tasting different every time or anything like that. That's why when I have friends over, I'll order pick up from here. Good portion sizes and I know exactly what I'm getting each time. 

Usually I go for the green curry with beef. Once in a while I'll substitute for the coconut rice, but it does get very sweet. I think while the food is good and satisfying, it's not, in my opinion, special or what I would call amazingly scrumptious.  

Their curries are good and I do enjoy their skewers. 

Service is inconsistent. When we dine in, sometimes it's great and sometimes it takes forever to get some assistance. Pick up is better cause there's almost always someone at the desk. Problem is, they make you feel a lot less important because half way through talking to me and taking my payment, the girl would have a full conversation with another guest... Completely leaving me standing there for 5-7 minutes midway through confirming my order and payment. It's not even just bad service, it's just plain rude. It's happened three times now.

 I only keep returning cause it's convenient and the food is consistent. So if your looking for a quick decent meal, this is a good place."}
{"text":"Ugh. 

Came here with a date who said Thai One On was his usual lunch spot (Why??). It was Thursday night and the restaurant was mostly empty.  I ordered Pad Thai, and was presented with a generous lump of orange mush. The dish was comprised of dry noodles that broke when I tried to pick them up. 

As my date talked, I noticed movement behind his head. Upon closer inspection, I saw it was a shiny brown insect creeping up the wall. I paid and got out of there.  

My date asked in the parking lot how I would rate the evening. I can't say much about him, but the restaurant gets a big fat F!"}
{"text":"This is by far my best experience in oriental food. The flavor, great portions, excellent service, prices quite  reasonable, nice decor (almost looks expensive) - but the bottom line is food. Simply the best. Had basil beef and uuh ooh so yummy. See pic of the dish. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment. We are customers of the downtown Toronto locations and thought that the quality would be the same so we decided to come in for dinner this past Friday night. 

730pm the place is empty save for one other family. The interior is dated, which isn't so much an issue, as is the fact the the place is visibly dirty. The tables and menu are sticky. Being very hungry and motivated by our experiences at the other locations, we decided to stay. Big mistake. 

I ordered a Thai seafood salad and a large lemongrass shrimp soup. The seafood salad should not have had 'thai' anywhere in the name of it as it was iceberg lettuce with some seafood strewn on top doused in what appeared to be 1000 islands salad dressing. Absolutely unappealing. 

The soup had nothing to do with lemongrass; no flavour at all. The broth was lacklustre and definitely NOT Thai style of cooking. 

My husband had one of the yellow curries which he said was so salty it ruined the flavour entirely. Coconut rice was overly 'wet' and gloppy. 

A mango salad looked like it had been cut up with a wood chipper. 

Over $58 for a meal that we felt was one of our worst in Markham."}
{"text":"When I go to Canada, I always eat here. I was surprised how it wasn't that great this last time. The restaurant is in a shopping center with a few other restaurants so parking can sometimes be difficult. We got sat right away so that was good. There was only 1 server out of the whole restaurant. The restaurant isn't that big but big enough to have more than 1 server. She was nice but very overwhelmed. 

We ordered our drinks. If you want a soda, it only comes in a can. If you want ice, forget about it. They do NOT have a ice machine. You do get chilled water so that's good. We ordered our food without any complications. But it was annoying when they were bringing the food 2-3 plates at a time. We were all waiting til all of our food was at the table to eat so some of our food was cold. 

My husband ordered the regular fried rice with chicken and my aunt ordered the pineapple fried rice with chicken and shrimp. When they were calling out the food, the server said \"Fried rice with chicken\" and my husband raised his hand. As he was eating it, he noticed a few shrimp in it and said it tasted really sweet. I looked at my aunt's plate and noticed she only had chicken in hers. I tried her fried rice and it wasn't sweet and tasted normal. We asked our server if what they ordered was what they got and she said yes. My husband told her his fried rice was really sweet and she looked closer and said \"Yeah, because it's pineapple fried rice.\" We looked at her confused and told her she said it was chicken fried rice. She quickly apologized. My husband and aunt ended up switching plates during dinner. 

After we were done eating, she cleared out of a few plates. We waited and waited. She was attending other tables. We finally had to ask for our check since she never brought it out to us. 

I'm so sad this place isn't as good as it used to be! But, I guess I'm ready to try another thai restaurant in Canada."}
{"text":"I just ordered from this place to work for lunch.

The food couldn't be any more mediocre than what I had. This main I had wasn't crispy like the menu said. I ordered the spring rolls and they tasted like what I can only imagine what horse manure tastes like. i couldn't even bring myself to finish them. The satay was lacking salt and the whole order was WAY too sweet for my linking. Even the peanut dipping sauce for the satay was sweet.

The service was quick though I will admit that and the guy who dropped it off gave me a ring before he got here so it was all really efficient. I just can't get over how I was expecting something a little greater than what I had ordered.

Also they are registered with just-eat.ca and will deliver with a minimum order of $20 for those who are stuck in the office like me.

Would I recommend them? Not really, but at the same time I'm not going to go out of my way to make sure no one ever goes there again. The food just wasn't for me."}
{"text":"I have tried this restaurant before for delivery. Food came an hour late no excuse for a house that is like 10 mins down the road. I called them even after the delivery scheduled time."}
{"text":"I give this place a solid 'meh.' I end up eating here often enough because I work in the culinary dead-zone that is industrial-farm Markham, and there are simply few other options. I usually get green curry chicken, and it's fine, if inconsistent (sometimes quite spicy, other times not at all). I usually just go in for pick up, but it's always ready when they say it will be and the staff are friendly. 

One weird thing - if you get the lunch special, the meals come with rice. Dinner time, the same meal, same price, no rice. What gives?"}
{"text":"went here for my dad's bday dinner. suprisingly, the place wasn't busy on a sunday evening. I originally called in to reserve for 11 people and booked a private room but when we got there the room was small and didn't have a large table but 3 small tables (one of them a small table for 2). So not so good first impression.

we started off with the assorted platter & veggie platter. the calamaries on the assorted were too small. the mango salad was good. didn't get a chance to try the shrimp skewer but it looked good. there was an item that was deep tried in a small triangle pattern. I thought it was tofu or maybe yam but i couldn't tell. it was good too. 

I was dissapointed with the entree dishes because of the abundance of sauce. it was just overloaded. it made the dishes like the thai curry steak and beef with oyster sauce too salty tasting.The pineapple fried rice wasn't even close to what I've tasted at other thai restaurants in markham. that's a no-go. another downer was the fish. we ordered the tamarind fried fish and the amount of meat in the fish was only good for 1-2 people. for the amount u pay for one fish dish ($16) it's not worth the amount your getting. PASS. 

The service was more of a highlight than the food. there were only 2 people working but they were quick with orders and came around our table every once in awhile to ask if we were ok with everything. Although, there was only about 15 other guests I doubt they could handle larger traffic."}
{"text":"This is the only Thai restaurant I've recently tried in the Markham area for a sit-in meal.  In the three times I've been here these the past 12 months for dinner, there're hardly any dine-in customers but lots and lots of takeaway patrons. 

We've tried the golden curry, green curry, and pad thai.  Food pieces in the curry could be chopped into slightly smaller sizes, but the curries all taste authentic. The pad thai noodles stick to each other a lot and is difficult to fork up without lobbing a huge chunk of noodles, and though most people enjoy Thai food because they are heavy on savoury sauces, the noodles were too salty for my palate preference.

Portions are generous and staff are polite.  But if you are going for a particular ambience to match the restaurant's offerings, there is little to expect from their dark walls, dim lights, and big tv screen (televisions in restaurants have almost annihilated the art of dining and conversation and I am still in mourning). If there was Thai music playing in this restaurant, I don't even recall hearing it.

If you want authentic curry dishes and don't mind the larger portions of food, then this is the place to go for dine-in and takeout. For a better pad thai restaurant, I'd direct you to my recommendation for a small place in Kitchener called Northern Thai.

If you are looking for an Orientalized* atmosphere to make a date night interesting, I wouldn't suggest this restaurant unless staring at the television screen and your neighboring diner's dishes is your Plan B exit out of an awkward firstdate!

*(Pardon the patronizing Western term but this is the best one I can think of to describe any kitschy-decor expectations readers may have when they think \"Let's go get Thai food and have an authentic Thai experience in Markham!\")"}
{"text":"Awful, awful, awful pad thai. It was like noodles mixed with Ketchup and lemon"}
{"text":"The orange chicken and devil chicken are good options. Kind of pricey but it is good food. A negative thing is the fact that such orders do not come with rice like Hakka restaurants do provide for free. You do have to pay for the serving of rice (which is understandable) but I'm so used to getting my chicken with a free rice serving. I recommend anyone to try the food. 

Enjoy the food."}
