{"text":"This place has been bookmarked by me ever since I started passing by it to goto work, and to say the least I am not disappointed!  My boyfriend absolutely LOVED the chicken katsu - the portions are huge (two pieces of chicken steak) with a good amount of rice & covered in this magic sauce!   I had the pork bone soup, which was decent, but not spicy enough. The portions were also larger than the average. No other tables actually ordered anything BBQ, but reviews are all raving about their fried chicken, so that's on my Must Try list!   The waiter did not really speak English, but he was very polite and tried to move as fast as he could, given he was the only waiter working that night.   Summary: Good value, Good food, Good Service - would return!"}
{"text":"This is a new family-run restaurant close to Yonge/Finch area. Standard korean fare - I ordered the pork bone soup for 6.99. Even though I was by myself I got 6 banchan - they are home-made and quite good, albeit a bit salty - kimchi, green beans, bean sprouts, radish, etc.  Everything is done well - the food is a 3 - 3.5 star, but the service is exceptional - and they always ask if you want more banchan, so I'd give this restaurant a 4."}
{"text":"Surprising good food, but I wish they didn't use this name as it is a popular chicken franchise in Korea. Decent prices and great service."}
{"text":"Kyochon BBQ apparently is not really a Korean BBQ place... at least for the night I went, none of the tables was doing any grilling and cooking.  Kamponggi and Gamjatang set ($19.80) Tuesday Special:  - Kamponggi (fried chicken) is just delicious!! I was so lucky to have that plate of freshly fried chicken covered in sweet and spicy sauce right in front of me. I lost count of how many pieces I had and surprisingly I could have more!   - Pork Bone Soup served bubbling hot!! It was A-OK..enough flavour but lack the spiciness...   Dak Galbi ($12.95X2) for Table Cooking:  - Table cooking?? More like table heating as the chicken were all pre cooked already Just a little strange to just mixed up the ingredients and call that cooking :) I am a good cook then - I do enjoy the hot sauces, the rice cakes and the vegetables  Kyochon BBQ offers lunch specials too.   Maybe I can try eating that plate of Kamponggi next time all by myself? But should I?"}
{"text":"This place is solidly down the middle for me. Nothing really stood out as great, nothing was horrible. I dined here with fellow yelpers and it was a first for all of us. We ordered the dakgalbi, gamjatang and kamponggi.   The dakgalbi comes as table-cooking only if you do 2 or more orders of it so we did that. Surprisingly then, it came out as a table-cooking but the chicken was already cooked. They mix it up all the ingredients at the table for you on top of the burner though. I suppose she figured it was done and she shut off the burner but we were just starting our meal and so we turned it back on at low heat. No big deal, right? Guess they're saving fuel money or something because as soon as she noticed she came right over and shut if off without looking at us or saying a word. Strange, indeed.   The kamponggi was alright. I love when it's freshly fried and still has that crispiness on the outside although it's covered in sauce, which is totally just my preference and I know I can get it like that at a few places up the street. The kamponggi here was already soft on the outside. The chicken was nice and tender.   The kamjatang came bubbling hot which was great and with a bowl of rice. The meat fell off the bone nicely. The actual soup base could use some work.. with more spices to give it a thicker, fuller flavour.   I would probably not go here again."}
