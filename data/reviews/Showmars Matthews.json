{"text":"The food is very good and the service is fast and friendly but they don't give you enough food for your money. I have been to this location 3 times the first time was perfect and the second time it was good but the third time was horrible don't know if I will give them a fourth."}
{"text":"Always good. My daughter loves it! Matthews location has great customer service!"}
{"text":"Showmars is one of the few places I feel like I could honestly say I've had the entire menu. It's a local staple, so I've been going to various locations my entire life, sampling all that they have to offer. They've pretty much got fast casual down to a science, and I've never been disappointed.  A few of my personal faves are the Grilled Chicken pita, the Old Fashioned Pita Burger, and the seafood, which is better than a lot of places that specialize in seafood only.  But everything is good. If you've never been, just look at the menu, and pick a dish you typically enjoy. You'll love their take on it, no doubt."}
{"text":"Their website is confusing as to what location has what special. The specials should be the same across the board. Management does not seem to care much.  They have repeatedly screwed up orders, which when you are a to-go customer, is HUGELY inconvenient. This is the LAST time I will give them my business."}
{"text":"So we have friends who love this place and decided to check it out.  Check in was quick. The girl who took our order was in training and from what I saw she was pretty new. Hubby tried to order the chicken stir-fry without veggies and we should've known then the food wasn't going to be very good.  The cashier told us it all comes together and cannot be separated so he got the grilled chicken breast and a side of rice.  It was ok. I ordered the flounder and shrimp platter with a fresh fruit cup and vegetable soup.  The shrimp was pretty good.  LOVED the hushpuppies.  Everything else was definitely not good.  The fruit was old and actually rotten looking.  Returned it and got the steamed veggies but they tasted gross and the soup tasted like it was out of a cheap can..not even a Campbell's can.  Needless to say we will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to Shomars over ten years ago and I've been sold ever since. Nine out of ten times I get the flounder and have never had a bad meal there, nothing but fresh and flaky, not greasy or heavy as in some of the restaurants that are solely fish places, no pun intended.  Great service, and great iced tea, a southern MUST."}
{"text":"Showmars is pretty much the same from store to store. Everything tastes good and is fresh. Walked right in and got my to go order fast. $11.99 for fish and shrimp platter, got a lot of food. $9 for chicken santorini, got a tiny serving. You should get more than what I got home with. More pita bread than chicken."}
{"text":"The dining room and entrance were littered with garbage and nasty food all over the booth seats.  No way could I eat here after seeing that.  I can only imagine how disgusting the kitchen is if they think that's acceptable."}
{"text":"A 5 star review...woohoo!! Showmar's deserves it,  and not just this location...but all of them. Yep this is a chain, a small local to the Charlotte area chain. Their tag line is \"Casual Dining....Fast\" and they do not disappoint. Greek based dishes are done to perfection, and they cross the line to American food with ease. My favs are the grilled chicken chef salad (huge) and the Old fashioned pita burger. The menu is varied enough to not tire of certain dishes and the prices are great. Although I have only eaten at about half of the 27 locations I feel comfortable giving Shomar's a blanket 5 star rating. Bottom line.....great food and service at a great price, enjoy."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. It's advertised as a greek place so I was kinda expecting kabobs or something but the menu offered a variety of options I wasn't expecting like burgers, a chili and a pretty nice selection of salads. I opted for the chicken blt salad and the portion size was pretty good. The cashier was super friendly and answered all of our questions without hesitation. We didn't have a long wait time for takeout and everything was correct. Overall it was a good experience and I wouldn't mind coming here again"}
{"text":"Great little fast-casual dining option that caters to families. The folks that work here are friendly and quite helpful.  If you are not in the mood for fried food, don't worry - they have a good greek salad that you can order with grilled chicken. You can get this in a shell or you can have pita bread on the side.  Prices are good."}
{"text":"Always good, dining room was a little messy last time I  visited but the food was fresh and they were pretty busy."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and quick take-outs! My favorite dish is fish sandwich. YUM It's on special on wednesdays!"}
{"text":"Okay, so just left the gym to come here to get their Greek salad, it was good and all, but my only complaint is I dined in, asked for a larger water than their cheap kid size cups, and the girl told me there would be an upcharge! Really?! For a larger water, this is really irritating, kinda ruined my whole experience here. They gave me another dressing for my salad for free, but a larger water is extra???? Wow... still like their food and will continue to visit, but maybe next time I'll try another location. I don't want to get up every 5 seconds for a refill, I drink ALOT of water."}
{"text":"We always enjoy eating here.  Great food, excellent customer service, and decent ambience.  Oven potatoes, greek salad, roasted chicken, fried fish, etc etc are all delicious.  Fresh, well-prepared food quick.  Much of the menu is (deliciously) fried, but there are some very good healthier choices, too. Excellent value for the money."}
{"text":"Showmars. What's different about the massive chain? Lets just say, there are very slight distinctions of each one. Each one puts their own twists on their menus. For this one, I really enjoy it because they offer a Philly Cheesesteak Pita. However, the only one thing is that the cheese they use for the default pita is Cheddar Cheese...  Who has ever heard of a Philly Cheesesteak with Cheddar Cheese?! That was probably the most disappointing thing I have to say about this Showmars. Other than that, it's like every other showmars you'll find in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"I ordered dinner for the family and went into the location to the order in the restaurant. The location is was very clean and we were greeted by a very sweet person at the register. We ordered an American Pita Burger and a Flounder Dinner 3 piece . The service was fast and the staff were very nice. Once home I was impressed with the food. The flounder dinner was hot, delicious and comes with a fries, coleslaw and a really good tarter sauce. The flounder is lightly breaded and succulent and tender. The American burger (REG) is very large with 3 burger patties and delicious cheese. The pita was crispy warm and toasty, the fries are typical Krinkle Cut Fries, but the  hush puppies are nice and crispy and tastier than cook-outs. Overall a very pleasant experience. I would say the fries are the only item slightly disappointing because they do lack salt as others have mentioned, however I will be back."}
{"text":"Just always remember that they don't serve Good Fast Food. They serve really Good Food Fast. I haven't ordered anything but they Gyro dinner for many years   it is my Gyro standard. But today I decided to try the Limited time Pepperjelly burger. It was very good. I was hoping for a little,  are lot as I like,  heat. It is also a little messy eating because the jelly melts and is sticky. Very glad I tried it. And the service was excellent as always.  And they had the prettiest cashier anywhere today. Just saying"}
{"text":"A Charlotte tradition. And treasure. Nothing fancy, just fast caz -- before it was fast caz, let it be known -- grill fare, with a few outriggers like fried flounder and really solid gyros. And salads.  Oh, and burgers? The \"fresh never frozen\" tagline seems from a by-gone age, but it is real -- and you can taste it. Best description I can come up with is a dime store lunch counter burger, where everything is churned out to order. The Old Fashioned (American cheese, mustard, slaw, chili and onions) is just that.  Fries and onion rings are nice, and the aforementioned flounder is among the best I've had anywhere -- and fried shrimp is very popular as well. Both can be on special at an given time.   But for me the gyros and gyro salads are the draw, the latter in particular. Big bowl of veggies, tangy Greek vinaigrette, and creamy tzatziki along for the ride. Big slices of gyro meat and pita wedges slapped on top. If there is a better quick, yummy, filling lunch out there for $8 I have not had it.  Oh, and asked for your iced tea half-and-half -- that way you'll get just enough sweet without a coma. Service is bright and cheerful, but kinda assumes a certain grasp of the menu that may not be obvious to newbies. Such is the price of visiting a Metrolina institution."}
{"text":"Stopped and had lunch with my son Nicholas McCarthy he had chicken strips I had a gyro both were very good place was clean staff was friendly enjoyed lunch immensely"}
{"text":"Apparently in the south it is common to enter a restaurant, place an order with a cashier, take a number and await one's food.  I find it odd, but then again, I can go with the flow.  My husband and I  had the gyros and a side salad.  This simple order required major undertaking as the cashier insisted that we could not have the side salad as requested and kept increasing the size of the salad.  A trip to the displayed menu at the entrance of the restaurant helped her to see our request and it then proceeded without further delay.  Our local area has many casual dining locations which feature a gyro and I have to say, our local fare is better.  Once seated the staff provided refills on our water and the beverages of our dining companions.  The table staff was very pleasant and timely in their refills.  I don't like fried food and I lament that I and my clothing and hair smelled of fried food when I left this establishment.  I think their exhaust system needs to be tweeked.  That said, people love their fried fish.  A large family group sat near us and spoke quite loudly about subject matter unfitting to the consumption of food.  I think I will refrain from returning to this particular restaurant."}
{"text":"We go here often for lunch and the service is top notch with the food being fresh and delicious each time.  The ladies will come around to check and see how everything is with a smile and will be fast to offer you a drink refill.  Popcorn ice- BONUS!!  Clean, casual and always enjoyable:)"}
{"text":"Our second trip to Showmars for lunch today.  Our meals were delivered to our table very quickly.  The food was good, especially the gyro meat.  I have had better pitas and Greek salads.  The fries were also very common, nothing special.  However, if you want fast service and good, not great Greek food, Showmars is the place for you."}
{"text":"The gyro platter was good, just so much lamb I couldn't eat it all! Their fries were great, fresh and hot and crispy! The servers were quick with refills and they were more than happy to take photographs for us. All in all, a nice experience."}
{"text":"Just consistency and a great price. Service staff are impeccably trained/cross trained, engaging & friendly. If there is a better piece of flounder or old fashioned cheeseburger out there, I dare to see it!  Value is what's served here every single time! Thanks  Bill Lassiter CEC,CCE CPCC- Hospitality Ed"}
{"text":"One of the better showmars in town the service is good food always comes out hot fresh and fast"}
{"text":"This place is so darn expensive it's not worth coming out to.   The salads have shrunk to small size.   The cashiers are all green and the biggie is no military discount and they don't shy away from not being upset about not having one they seemed proud of it. Pretty damn sad.    We don't want much I don't even care if it's a free drink just if the place recognizes the veteran.   You basically pay all the overhead for the televisions and video menus.  Sad won't be back anytime soon thought after a year there might be a change.   Sad"}
{"text":"No matter when or which location I go to I am always pleased with Showmars. The customer service is awesome. They are always pleasant. Everyone! They even come to your table to see if they everything is ok. The food is always fresh. OMG I love the fish."}
{"text":"Showmar's has redone all of their restaurants apparently and they did a pretty nice job!  The inside is neat and clean, with a nice layout-very modern!  The staff is very pleasant and welcoming.  You order at the counter and then your food is brought out to you.  They have servers bringing out refills, or anything that you may need-friendly and convenient.  The crispy chicken salad was awesome as usual. I ask for my chicken extra crispy! :)"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here.  I've been to 5 or 6 different Showmars locations and they are fairly consistent.  I usually get the old fashioned pita burger or gyro pita.  The crinkle fries suck, no thanks.  The fish sandwich is one of the best I've ever had and the tartar sauce is out of this world.  This is my \"old standby\" food option; when my GF and I cannot figure out what we want for dinner we usually just go here.  My only annoyance for Showmars is not having a \"non cash\" option to tip the waitstaff (drink refiller/table wipers).  I feel guilty leaving without having a dollar to throw down...but I don't carry cash and there's no option to write in a tip on the receipt so.....!?!?!  Cool thing is this location has free wifi...so ask for the password if you need wifi."}
{"text":"How is possible that there are only 30 something reviews on ShowMars? The first thing I fell in love with when I came to Charlotte was this place. Greek food fast and throw in some pita burgers. Why not? The service is always exceptional, the place is clean, and the gyros are delicious. My fave though is the Cheddar Mac, chicken, mac&cheese, bacon with some pita bread. There is some fusion for ya. The price is a little high, but it seems up to par. Had to give ShowMars some love..."}
{"text":"I've been on a huge greek salad kick lately.  Literally I go to this place once a week to get my fix.  What keeps me coming back?  My good always comes out quickly, which is a huge plus when I'm ordering \"to go\" to get back to work.  The counter staff and wait staff are always very friendly and my food is consistently fresh and delicious.  I know exactly what to expect every time.    I dont consider myself a fast food connoisseur, but I will make an exception for this place.  No guilt and a full tummy every time.    The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5, is I do feel $10 is a bit steep for a take out salad.  But then again, that hasnt stopped me from coming back."}
{"text":"Fast and quick..... Usually go here for a quick salad or some fried comfort foods.  Although this last trip was disappointing since they closed 1 hr before we got there.  I guess they are cutting back on hours.  3pm on Sundays...  at least we know for next time.  Food is not overpriced, you are ordering from the counter and a server brings it to you, so no extra tip needed.  Just don't come here with a lot of expectations - it's in between fast food place and a sit-down which is something I need sometimes."}
