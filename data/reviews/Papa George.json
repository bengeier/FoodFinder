{"text":"Papa George Cafe is a hidden gem. Tucked at the end of the plaza, I really didn't expect it to be busy. To my surprise, there was actually a small line up when we got there at 2pm on Sunday. We were seated relatively quickly. They have a good selection of food, nothing out of the ordinary. I ordered the smoked salmon with chicken angel hair pasta in cream sauce. It was very creamy and seasoned just right. The chicken was tender and went really well with the rest of the dish. Everyone else ordered ham and chicken pasta, steak with spaghetti,  and rice with tomato minced meat sauce topped with fried egg. Overall, everyone was really satisfied with their dishes. We also ordered a hk style French toast which was delicious as well. Instead of the usual toast that is served in most Chinese restaurants, this one is cut up into cubes so each piece is crispy all around. A few Chinese restaurants serve French toasts this way and Papa George does it quite well. We felt that we got a good value for the food with the price we paid and will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Usually I have fettuccine  in Alfredo sauce. This restaurant offers me a new prospective of fettuccine . Of course with CAD 14.50, I don't expect the truffle is of top grade, but still taste very good.  The clam chowder comes with it is good too."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday.  Make sure to come early or make reservations because the restaurant does get filled due to them having roughly 25-30 seats available.  Decor/atmosphere, it is decently decorated, nothing fancy.  They don't play loud music so it is nice, good place to chat with others.  Service, typical Chinese, they did come by to take our order which is nice since I normally expect to flag someone down.  They did come by once to get the bread basket back and once to refill our tea.  No issues here.  Food, typical Chinese cafe food in my opinion.  It seems to be rated well, but I don't understand why.  Meals all seemed to be combos where you would get a soup and drink or some where you just get a drink.  Things like baked pork chop on rice, curry chicken, and some Italian pastas are present in the menu.  Cost, for a lunch combo (I didn't see an option for it not to be) it includes a soup (clam chowder or borscht along with garlic bread), a Chinese style drink (hot milk tea or coffee, cold drinks was $1.25 extra) and your main dish (they have a variety of baked dishes like pork chop, ox tongue, curries, and others) for roughly $10 before tax/tip.  Price isn't bad for what you get, seems typical for what I expect to pay.  I don't think I'd come back.  I wouldn't say it isn't worth it, but it is your typical Chinese cafe.  If you didn't have to wait, it is okay, but I don't think it is worth waiting for.  We arrived at 11am when it opened and it didn't fill up quickly, but by the time we left at around 12:30pm, there were customers waiting outside to come in.  Cash only!  This is slightly annoying to find out at the end (unless we missed the sign)."}
{"text":"Came here around 8, just a bit before their last call. It was a lot less crowded in the evening, as I tried to get a table during lunch hours, the doors are usually crammed with people.   They don't accept credit or debit, so rmb take cash with you. Overall, great experience. Really big portions, might want to share.  I've heard their pastas taste great, haven't tried yet. But will soon"}
{"text":"Papa George has gone out of business and is CLOSED."}
{"text":"Came for the HK style milk tea and was disappointed. The tea was burnt/old and overly creamy.  Ordered the satay beef instant noodles, honey garlic chicken wings and fish cutlet spaghetti. Food was mediocre but at the price point it's on par. The chicken wings were decent but the spaghetti was bland and the satay beef was tenderized with meat tenderizer. For $1-2 more per dish, I think you can get the same dishes with much better ingredient quality at other diners."}
{"text":"I gave it 4stars based on comparison of other HK style restaurants in the surrounding area. Food  is reminecent of \"Dicken's\" cafe back when they were at Chalmers gate but this place seems better in terms of taste.  I came here for lunch. Ordered truffle oil and shrimp angel hair pasta, and baked tomato rice with ox tongue. Lunch set menu are about $8~10, includes soup, garlic bread and drink. I enjoyed their clam chowder soup. Truffle oil pasta was quite good in flavour. I wasn't crazy about the baked ox tongue dish. Portions indeed are big.   Next time I might try their crispy fried pork cutlet or baked chicken with gravy with roasted veggies. Seems like they have option to opt out of rice or pasta as a side and load up on the veggies instead. Saw other tables eating it and looked quite good. Gotta study the menu more next time..  Hopefully they will keep the quality of food high and prices at a great value. Did I mention they had great service too? For the  nine or ten tables, they had 3 attentive servers. That's a bonus point for any Chinese restaurant! Tip:closes at 7pm."}
{"text":"DH and I checked this out tonight, having seen the ads on the sign for flaming cheese and Greek wines, and were less than impressed.  Having the old Pickles decor is a little jarring, I must say, although I can see why they have kept it.  The food was decent, but not as good as other Mediterranean places here in town.  We had the hummus appetizer, after being told that the flaming cheese, which was advertised on both the outdoor sign and the specials board, was no longer available.  However, while we were finishing our hummus, we saw no less than three other tables enjoying their flaming cheese.  To her credit, our waitress told us about the communication snafu, but this was well after we had received our meals.  Despite the fact that the restaurant wasn't particularly busy, service was quite slow.  The portions were decent, but not great.  We both thought the prices were high for what we got.  For the same amount of money, one can definitely have a better Greek/Mediterranean meal and better ambience elsewhere in town."}
{"text":"Of all the lack luster HK style restaurants around the neighborhood, this small and quaint spot is quite refreshing.  The decor and ambiance is one of the better ones, and the portions are very generous.  Service and quality of food is pleasant enough to return."}
{"text":"Papa George is a small diner with around 8-10 tables that serves amazing HK diner food with a twist of Italian(mostly pastas).  I got the chicken steak with spaghetti.  The meal included soup which I didn't get to pick nor the server tell me what it was. It also included a drink.  The portion is a good size and the servers are friendly and attentive.   Will def be back for the baked pork chop or the spaghetti with meat sauce."}
{"text":"I have had far better Greek food at other places, and there are better diners, but nothing matches the combination of good food and absolutely top-notch service that you find at Papa George's.  \"Of course! This is Papa George's--We ain't no chain!\" the owner said when I asked for a small menu substitution.  I feel if your'e going for teh Greek/Diner combo, you can't go wrong with the \"American\" Gyros, French fries, and if you have room later--baklava sundaes! (ice cream sundaes with baklava crumbs atop them.  Reflect on how unhealthily delicious that is).  Sunday brunch is also tasty, although perhaps not exceptional.  Again the service tips it from a 4 star to a 5 star review.  Additionally, they have a happy hour on Thursdays with $2 martinis (unfortunately, they're about as good as you can expect for $2).  Don't fail to check out their weekly $5 lunch specials, though.  THOSE are fantastic.  Can you tell I have a soft spot for Papa George?  'cuz I do."}
{"text":"Looking for a warm plate of HK style pasta the way your mom used to make?  Craving that cup of HK milk tea that you had during your travels in Hong Kong?  Just looking for a bite on the fly, but you don't want to drop more than $15 on a meal?  Well Big Papa George just might be your jam.  This place is similar to any staple HK cafe you have been to, except the quality is a bit better.  The milk tea is great, and the selection of dishes certainly keeps you coming back for more.  I usually order the spaghetti and the rose sausage pasta in particular.  It's good and fills you up, I mean it's not like eating at Scarpettas in NYC or anything, but what do you expect for under $15.  Come here if you're hungry and don't mind the crowds.  This place is relatively new to the area so it gets packed quick.  Also it closes mad early, at like 6pm or so on weekends (weird I know), so make sure you come for lunch and don't stay for dinner knowmsayin?    I love it when we eat at Big Pop-pa."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the food I received is more of an acquired taste but for even for the low price I paid I was bitterly disappointed. I got a fettuccine with beef in pepper sauce and it was awful. The beef was essentially rubber and the sauce was edible at best. I tossed it out as soon as I got home. I got a lemon tea that was 90% lemon and 10% tea. Basically by the end of this meal I had to go eat another one. 2 stars just because of how cheap it is."}
{"text":"As a HK style restaurant, I would say this one has the better food quality and taste when comparing to other HK style restaurants in TO. But of course, it's abit more expensive as well, but on average about 2-3 bucks more per dish than the norm. So for me, who prefer quality over price, especially when the difference is 2-3 bucks more, I would pick this restaurant.  I have tried several dishes there but the one I liked the most is the \"baked pork chops on fried rice\". The pork chop is thicker than the one you usually get in a HK style restaurant and actually has some real meat taste (which often lacks in HK style restaurants). So I would recommend this dish because it just work so well with my palate.  But the place closes at 8pm, i wish they would open just abit longer so it can fit my work schedule better as well. :) But I guess I cannot have the whole world."}
{"text":"When I first checked it out I was not impressed. The Pickles decor was garish, the waiter rude, and the meat kind of dry.   After a visit tonight...all I can say is that the improvement is amazing. The service was fantastic, the evil Pickles stuff is mostly gone, and the food was incredible. They now serve local lamb and heritage Berkshire pork. The souvlaki is now even better than I remember from when they had a booth at the farmer's market. But the lamb ribs I had...wow...marinated to perfection with delicious tangy vegetables on the side. I'm a picky eater and I was practically gnawing on the bones.  Considering the meat was all local and sustainable, I was amazed that my entree only cost $13. If you want to support local farmers and eat truly delicious food, check this place out."}
{"text":"my first visit since it changed from pickles....  i ordered what i always order here - the breaded pork tenderloin. it's exactly the same as it always was - and that's a GOOD thing, in my book. it's only on the menu as grilled, but they have that old standard breaded one, if you ask for it.  my son ordered a gyros, & liked it. he chose lamb slices. they offer standard gyros meat as well, plus a spicey version.  the decor hasn't changed.  next time, i'll try a greek entre...  cool touch - the new owner was walking around talking to patrons with his young daughter. she's learning to cook & likes to cook, especially eggs, she told us...scrambled!"}
{"text":"The reason for visiting this place was because it was so mysterious and hidden. I had no idea what this place was and what the rave was all about. My brother had recently visited the place and said it had good quality food for the price/portion. Decided to come try this place tonight and I was immediately impressed.  I had high hopes for this place, but seeing the exterior of the restaurant made me feel like I was going to regret coming. Walked in and was greeted immediately - didn't have to wait a second before a gentleman seated us. Service was polite and snappy, unlike other western HK cafes. I ordered the pork chop + chicken steak w/ honey mustard sauce and my lady had the tiger shrimp pasta. The (veggie) soup came first, which I must say was pretty good. They didn't go easy on the salt though, which was my only gripe. However, the entree was a totally different story. The pork chop was unbelievably tender/soft (something I can only dream of cooking one day) and the chicken steak was juicy to the point of no return (what I mean is you will never EVAR go back to eating chicken your old way). Maybe I'm exaggerating a little, but I reckon I'm not far off. Mine came with spaghetti and that was also to perfection - soft enough to be chewy. The pasta was also very good, but I think it might need some cheese.. perhaps I'm just picky with pasta (bc I'm pasta man), but I usually take my pasta with cheese.. NOMS! I also had HK milk tea that came with my dinner, which was also gracefully made. I had such a FUL-filling night (hee hee I'm so CHEESY)  Before I end this, I have to backtrack all the way to when I was being seated. I had to use the mens room so badly, I barged in and was stunned to see... A TABLE AND TWO CHAIRS IN THERE! I think that's a great idea, especially when the place gets too busy. They won't need to do renovations to make more room - just send guests into the washroom! They get a private dining room + all you can pee private toilet! lol  Before before I end this, I really liked their idea for this restaurant. I know for a fact that they already thought of how to run this place. They strategically planned their kitchen at the front of the restaurant, while the back was for cleaning. So when they're working, there's always a free flow type of motion - they get the food, send the food, pick up dirty dishes on the way, bring them to the back, go back to the front and the cycle repeats itself. That's pretty damn smart.. well done, Papa George!  Before before before I end this, I took off 0.5 because of the \"private\" room service lol. I don't want to do my business in there and feel like someone is sitting there or will be sitting there. It's kind of scary if it was darker in there..  Again, well done! Till we meet again..   Jennifer K mentioned that the kitchen was at the front prior to Papa George being there, so props to the previous owner! :)"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the Pickles' sign and decor - Papa George is open for business. I could careless about interior design as long as the food is off the hook. And that it was!   Dolmades, juicy pork souvlaki skewers and rich spanakotiropita are made to perfection - even though it's different from how my family prepares it. Their tzatziki is loaded with dill and is probably the most flavorful one I have tasted in quite some time.   I do, however, prefer warm dolmades with lamb (you can opt to have them served warm) and the pork portions could be a little larger for the price. The spanakotiropita could have had flakier phyllo. But it was well worth the calories. And what Greek menu would be complete without egg lemon soup? I'm crossing my fingers for it to appear on the menu.   Finish off the meal with baklava - my favorite dessert! It's honeyed phyllo with nuts and cinnamon. Opt for the baklava sundae if you need a sweeter kick.   Eventually, the nasty Pickles' menu & ridiculous top 50 songs pumped through the speakers will end soon enough (unless you let the manager know which items you can't live without), the staff will continue to be employed and more Greek plates will be introduced.   Upscale snobs - find another place to dine."}
{"text":"This place. This. Place.  Let me shoo out the elephant in the room here - I am white. I really like HK-style food although I haven't had a ton of experience with it. I don't feel that this was the problem here - I genuinely think this place has some issues.  They only take cash, which is annoying but not a deal-breaker. What's the deal-breaker? I would say the food quality, for the most part. I ordered a seafood dish with cream sauce over rice - there was actually a lot of seafood, but I got some shell bits. The sauce was fine and the rice was good. The (white, not red) clam chowder that came with it was good, as was the garlic bread.  My companion's dish, however - steak with fruit and potato salad. The potato salad was sweet and loaded with mayonnaise, the fruit was flaccid, and the meat - oh my goodness. Neither of us were convinced it was beef - I thought it may have been horse meat, but my dining partner (who has actually eaten horse) thought it was something more sinister. The meat was greasy, slippery, and chewy. There was gristle in the middle. How????  I mean, they were obviously trying here, with the presentation and everything. I just can't deal with the glistening meat slab of unknown origin surrounded by, like, apple slices. smh"}
{"text":"For nostalgic reasons I find Papa George to be the feel good place to be.  I found myself as a single diner at lunch and felt so comfortable I had a nice conversation with the table next to me and soon after discussed about Hokkaido vs. Hong Kong weather 2 tables down.  Demographically aged these Hong Kong customers made the restaurant feel like dining with a bus-load of Casinorama retirees.  Along with caring thoughtful servers, HK style menu, reasonable pricing, I can understand why I felt like I fit in so much.  Nothing on the menu is complicating, it's simply done and done the right HK way.  I savour their Chicken steak so much, I've had it with spinach cream sauce and on borscht-instant-noodle.  Always packed during lunch and surprisingly never felt rushed out while chilling with my Lemon iced-tea, Milk Tea, or iced Milk Tea(a bit sweet but so silky smooth).  Papa George is a monthly treat, do be aware once you find that special dish of your liking do not venture out too far.  Certain dishes do tend to be unusual and the beef chunks in the borscht is purely for aesthetic purposes, do not bite in there."}
{"text":"Think a step up from Mykonos.  Papa George has kept many of the Pickles menu options, but came up with an inexpensive Greek menu for those who want a sample of the Mediterranean.  Certainly not my first choice for authentic Greek food, but on a budget it definitely works and is filling, too."}
{"text":"Another surprise tucked inside of a plaza. This is a very tiny Hong Kong Cafe. We came for afternoon tea and was seated quickly as we just missed the lunch rush.  They have a good variety of items for afternoon tea.  I chose the black pepper beef with fettuccine.  The other dish we ordered was on their lunch menu,  baked pork chop with tomato sauce with rice. Imo to really try if a hk cafe is good, you need to try a baked item.   First and foremost the afternoon pasta dish was a really good portion (even for lunch) and their beef was really fresh and the sauce had just the right amount of saltiness.  They also added some mushrooms which was a nice touch.  Pasta was cooked al dente. I would definitely order this again and would recommend it.  The baked pork chop with rice was delicious.  Ingredients were fresh, sauce was tasty and not too salty.   One more thing to add is that their lunch combos come with a soup and garlic toast. The soup we got was cream of mushroom and I loved how they pureed it as not often do I see hk cafés doing this. Thumbs up!   The only thing that was not too good were the drinks.  The honey lemon water was a tad too sweet and the yin yang drink was not as smooth as I am use to. I would definitely come back though for their food!!"}
{"text":"Fancy and refined does not always equate to great food and this is most apparent at Papa George. With their exclusive hours, few tables and their insistence that you make reservations I can see why they make come across as pretentious. Even their chef is all dressed up with a true chef's hat and all.  But there's not a whole lot of substance to hold up all that pretentious vibe. The food is OK at best. There is something lacking about this place that I just can't quite sum it up. Their food reminds me of Dickens -- the once hip HK style restaurant that was once the very definition of refined HK style cafe in Scarborough. They are now reduced to  a shadow of their former self--seeking refuge in very defunct Richlane mall (Fu sic guy).  Anyhow, I wouldn't necessarily say they are bad per se. You will leave with a full stomach for sure but also an emptiness in your appetite."}
{"text":"First off, I love how secluded the location is. The restaurant itself is not big but honestly it makes it even more homey and cozy. Their renovations also has a warm, cozy and retro theme to it, super cute.   Service was fantastic, food and price is a little more upscale than most hk style restaurants. I love their penne with mushroom, bacon and cheese. I am a regular customer."}
{"text":"Grand opening today and it's packed.  Even though it's packed; the food have been arrived fast.  We have a few things to share:  Pork cutlet with fruits and salad.  It's nicely presented with fresh fruits.  The pork cutlet is crispy golden brown on the outside and tender inside.  Both the curry veal on rice and baked chicken A La Portuguese are rich in flavor.  The veal and chicken are juicy and tender.  The lunch set comes with soup and drink.  I love their borscht soup. Just seeing its rich tomato red color makes my mouth water.  All of us ended our meal with a cup of hot milk tea.  It's great to warm us up before going out in the freezing cold day!"}
{"text":"Café George is a Hong Kong cafe that serves Hong Kong style Western food, such as baked rice, pasta, steaks/chops with sauce on rice/pasta, etc..  Don't mix it up with HK cafés that serve mainly Chinese dishes such as stir fry rice and noodle, noodle soup, etc..  or those that serve a bit of both.    We ordered a pasta and a beef on rice.  Both tasted all right.  I thought the rose pasta sauce tasted bland.  Mental note-order tomato sauce next time.  The portion was very generous.  The services was effective and efficient.  The price was cheap.  The value was good.  I would return for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This is a real hidden gem at a rather less popular plaza. We actually parked at the wrong place when we first got here because the plaza next door was a lot more popular, I'm glad that this restaurant is at the less popular plaza because parking is a lot easier.   Environment: I liked the cozy environment here as I walked in the door. Even though the renovation feels dated, it's gives a nice HK family restaurant vibe, especially with classic 70/80s HK music playing in the background. The restaurant is rather small and is best suited for small groups of 4 or under.  Food: I wanted the French toast but apparently they don't offer it for dinner. Bummer. But I got the mixed steak from their dinner special (19.99) and my friend ordered the smoked salmon chicken spaghetti (12.99). They both comes with a complementary soup (tomato soup/clam chowder) and a hot drink (coffee/tea/milk tea/lemon tea). I enjoyed the portion size of the food and quite honestly was impressed by the flavour of my steak. The pork chop and chicken has good flavour, the beef was a little bland and too well done for my liking, but the cream sauce adds additional flavour as well.  Service: This is a small restaurant with only 1 actual server and another who does serving and kitchen work. Overall the servers were friendly and promptly came to our table to ask if we want our hot drink to be served as we were about to finish our meal."}
{"text":"Came here at 6:30 on a Saturday on a whim.  Upon walking in, the entrance is a short small corridor that is basically single file as they seem to cram tables where they can  Upon entering, a table for 4 was just leaving. When the waitress came over she asked for \"how many\", which we said 2. She then said \"fully booked\" and turned away.  No clue why they would ask for how many if they are fully booked. Also no clue why they would just say \"fully booked\" when a table for 4 just left.  Can't recommend at all, and won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon. The place is very small just like everyone mentioned already. There was a small line up but we only had to wait about 5 minutes. I think service was very fast. Within 5 minutes from ordering the food began arriving. Everything was made fresh too since all the food we ordered was scolding hot.   From the all day breakfast menu we ordered the black truffle scrambled eggs with toast, fruits and potato wedges $9.99 - tried some of the eggs and it was pretty good. Meal comes with drink so we got milk tea.   For my own main dish I got the smoked salmon and chicken pasta for $8.99 - It comes with garlic toast, soup and the milk tea. For the pasta you can choose the different types of pasta they have available like angel hair, spaghetti and fusilli. You can also add extra cheese for $1. For the sauce there are no options and came with a cream based sauce. As for the smoked salmon it came sliced thin and had four large pieces. For the soup we all choose the clam chowder and it tasted okay. Not overly salty and decent flavours but with very little clam. Overall, I thought the main part of the dish was pretty average but good value for all the things you get with it.  I also got to try the curry fish with rice $8.99 - The fish was soft and smooth plus the portion was very generous. The curry sauce was not overly spicy but it had a small kick to it with all the ginger flavour it had. Comes with the garlic toast, soup and milk tea. Once again, average dish but good value.  Finally, for dessert we shared the French toast cubes $5.99 - The size of this thing is ridiculously huge. They were more like French toast bricks. Deep fried to perfection with a slight crisp on the outside but still soft on the inside. Drizzled with maple syrup and butter. This dish is definitely for sharing because if one person were to eat this thing then you would have consumed all the calories you need for a day in one dish.   To sum things up; average food, good value, fast service and a French toast which is to die for. +0.5 for the amazing French toast.   3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Papa George was definitely a huge surprise for me. I originally visited on Tuesday, but they close every Tuesday...so I came back today to try this place out.  The design of this restaurant looks like some sort of French cuisine, but it is a western HK style cafe. It's also very small, so I can imagine long lineups on weekends, especially considering there was a small lineup at 3pm on a Wednesday. We were serviced immediately and were given the menus, but that was pretty much it to the extent of good service.  I ordered the spaghetti with clams and rose sauce, while my dad ordered the satay beef instant noodle soup. Despite the fact the presentation wasn't the best, the food itself was very good! The rose sauce was very creamy, there were plenty of spaghetti, and the clams didn't have any sand in them. The satay beef instant noodle soup had probably one of the best satay broths I've ever tasted. To make things even better, the beef felt like it was from a tender steak; thick but chewy! Definitely something I would personally try in the future as well.  Both the iced lemon tea and iced milk tea were nothing memorable.  Despite the shoddy service after the initial phase, I'm still confident in giving this place 4 stars, and will certainly come back. I wish it opened till 10pm though...oh well."}
{"text":"3.5  If I could describe Papa George in 2 words it would be Dickens lite.  Papa George is a nice HK style cafe to come for lunch or a very early dinner.  Pros: Very friendly staff Food quality is pretty good  Cons: Small place Hours are strange  If you've ever been to Dickens, Papa George will have a similar feel for you.  As soon as you walk in, there's a European feel to the place.  It feels like a small chalet nestled somewhere in France.  One think i notice it the clientele ranges from teens, families to the seniors.  Groups of all ages frequent this place.   The place is rather small.  There are about 10 tables total and it's fairly busy most of the time.  We had come twice before but it was so full that we had to go somewhere else.  One look at the menu and again I was reminded of Dickens.  We ordered the pan fried chicken steak with rice and the Portuguese chicken on pasta.  All meals come with garlic bread, soup and a drink here. (just like Dickens)  The food comes rather quickly which is nice.  My chicken steak is very nice.  I ordered the same thing at Dickens and it looks very much the same, right down to the sauce.  overall very good dish.  My GF's Portuguese chicken though, was more like a curry than Portuguese sauce.  Portuguese sauce should be a lighter coconut based curry.  When it's more curry it takes away from the dish.  It was still OK, but could of been better.  Another thing to note, the drink (like Dickens) is served at the end of the meal.  If you want it with your meal, you will have to tell the server.  The servers here are all very nice.  There were many regulars there the servers knew well and the conversations were almost like the servers were eating with them  They maintained good service while still mingling with regulars when they could very well. Another thing to note is the hours of this place.  They close at 8 which is early by HK style cafe standards.  If you want to have dinner here which I know I would, you have to have an earlier one.  It's a very strange hour to close for HK style cafes but it is what it is.  Papa George for me is basically Dickens with a smaller menu, space and hours.  It still does things very well though.  If it weren't for the hours, this would be an excellent choice for dinner.  If you're a fan of Dickens you should definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a weekday afternoon (made a reservation for noon - they get to capacity!).  I ordered the baked fish filet with cream sauce & cheese on rice and ham & clam spaghetti in tomato sauce. Both of these meals were delicious! The bill came to ~$25 after tax and tips. I highly recommend the baked fish filet with cream sauce & cheese on rice, it was very delicious. The portions don't look huge on plate but it is definitely enough to fill you up!  Their meals come with soup and a slice of warm garlic toast, along with a beverage.  Will definitely be back here to try other things on the menu & afternoon tea.  PS. You can call ahead to make reservations, even on weekends! They are closed on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"not bad at all chinese diner providing more western food (pasta and such) comes in combo with coffee and tea"}
{"text":"OMG I don't know why I didn't notice this place until now... it is a bit hidden. But I'm now a fan. Staff were all super efficient.   Their lunch specials are great. Next time I will take a pic of the revised menu. I ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese, which includes a soup (veggie or cream), & HK style tea $9.99 and had it to go. Portions were generous and it was super yummy! I always order this dish at HK cafes but not all are tasty. Not all restaurants include a soup either for that price. I will definitely be coming back to Papa George again for lunch.   I will admit they could probably make the HK tea a bit stronger but otherwise everything else was awesome.   My order was placed and wrapped and done in... 5 mins! Super fast and I still had time to go next door to prepare for my yoga class."}
{"text":"I come here whenever I need to satisfy my craving for hk Cafe food. The milk tea is good and I always order the all day lunch black pepper sauce chicken steak with rice. I haven't yet found another dish that comes to par. The potato wedges are very bland in my opinion. I hope they expand the menu soon because there isn't too much variety to choose from. The employees treat every customer very nicely. But the restuarant seems a bit cramped up. Their honey garlic wings are to die for! But if you ever pass by or are near by you definitely won't be disappointed by papa George!"}
{"text":"Finally I got a chance to give this restaurant a try cause my friends always told me it's packed here.  It's a very small restaurant with about 10 tables and open kitchen.  It's almost full when we arrived on Sunday around 6pm.  Four of us ordered 2 salads-Salmon with mango and the other one is chicken with fruits (the first one under salad category), Baked pork chop with rice and bacon & shrimp with spagetti in white sauce.  To my surprise the pork chop is very tender.  Overall all the dishes taste good.  Servers are friendly.  Although the restaurant closed at 8pm, but there's still lineup at 7:30pm when we left."}
{"text":"Occasion: Saturday night dinner  Ordered:  - Gravy pork chop rice  - Black Truffle with Shrimp Pasta in cream sauce  Came with: - 2 drinks - garlic bread - 2 soup   The waiting area was so small I thought I was going to tumble over on someone's table and land on their food whenever people tried to exit.   Your typical hong kong style cafe except the environment makes it feel slightly more upscale. (Slightly more). Everything from the garlic bread to the cold lemon tea tasted very typical.   The clam chowder was surprisingly really good and so was the Russian borsch soup.   The gravy pork chop rice my bf ordered tasted like pizza o_O.. I don't think I'd want to eat pizza in a hk cafe.   The black truffle with shrimp pasta in cream sauce was very strong on the truffle - which I enjoyed. But it was hard to really get the full taste of this \"could have been wonderful dish\" if they cooked the pasta just a little bit longer. The pasta was hard. It tasted like it was undercooked. Raw pasta, yuck. It could have been such a good dish....sigh.  A little bit overpriced for a hk cafe compared to many others. Bill came up to about $30 something for the two of us. Usually hk cafes are closer to the $20 mark for the both of us.  Don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Why do my parents insist on making Papa George our go-to lunch place (other than dimsum)?  Could be that the prices are amazing for the portions. Could be the properly JOLTED Hong Kong Milk Tea. Could be the nice selection of salads, should you be on the market for \"healthy\" hk cafe food (relatively speaking). Could be the friendly staff, who quickly learn who their regulars are, and greet them happily. Could be their chicken steak. Get. it.  Many reasons. Whatever it is, there's usually a line in the tiny little space They serve the minestrone or cream soup with garlic bread, and ends with a nice tea/coffee, if you choose the combos. Their tea time menu is a steal, and ensures you get a lot of bang for your buck.   Oh, could also be their free wifi. Their password is conveniently on the chalkboard too!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed having dinner at this place.  I had the fish cream pasta.  Unlike 99.99% of all Chinese restaurants in Markham that attempt to serve Western food, this place got the texture of their pasta right (El Dente)!  So I was impressed by that.    The restaurant is quite small, so it's very difficult to get a seat without a reservation.  The prices are reasonable and food quality is good for a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Papa George . definitely promising if you looking for good quality well prepared Hong Kong Style Cafe food.  This restaurant is small and packed. This may not be the coolest new and hot place to hang out for a foodie but with all the Seniors eating here, you know it is good value.  Black Truffle and Shrimp with Pasta with Cream Sauce Meal Set ($9.99).  At this price point, what I served really exceeded my expectation. Garlic Bread and Soup with a choice of Borscht or Clam Chowder. Pasta with a choice of Spaghetti, Linguine, Penne, Rotini and more. And of course a choice of coffee/tea.  The portion size of the pasta is huge. Easily can feed 2 people. I can assure you that truffle oil had been used as I can smell and tasted the aroma of truffle. A few thing they can improve is not to overcook the pasta and not overdo the sauce. The pasta was a little to soggy and mushy for my taste.  I might try other items maybe their curry dish. Afternoon tea from 2:30 pm-6:00 pm.   Closes 7 pm with last call at 6 pm. Early dinner anyone?   Cash Only!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty far from where I live, but I still come here from time to time. The food here is great, I enjoy dining here with my friend. I would normal order the steak with egg and my friend would usually order the chicken/ pork cutlet.  They served some really good European/ Italian style cuisine, but it is on the pricy side compared to other cafés. The food here is amazing and very delicious. They also serve a really good clam chowder with garlic toast before the entrée. The soup is really rich and creamy, and I enjoy it very much.   Two downsides of this restaurant is it is really small (capacity around 30 people) and they close really early (8 pm). Sometimes I would have to meet up with my friends earlier to have dinner here, otherwise I would have to drive around that location and look for other restaurants.  Service: 3/5 Food: 4/5 Environment: 3/5  Overall: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"I have been debating whether this place is good or not, and I think I've finally figured out why I just can't get a feel for it.  I think Papa George is supposed to be an upscale place since its prices are comparable to Olive Garden and Biaggis ($9.69 patty melt; $11.85 lunch serving of spinach pie (spana...)), but with smaller portions. Yet its online specials include an entree + 6-pack of beer. (What upscale restaurant advertises six-packs of beer?) I also have a hard time separating the place from Pickles, and its location among blue-collar shops takes away from the restaurant's possible sophistication. So every time I go, I expect lower prices and/or bigger portions than what actually happens.  The food is not bad, but it is not great either. It's a place that you would not mind eating at if your friends asked you to, but you would never go there by your own decision. I think it's just poor execution of the restaurant's concept, which makes me sad because the owners and staff are nice and deserve to do well there."}
{"text":"I think it is clear that there is better mediterranean food in champaign (pasha) and probably also better diners (merry ann's) but my experience at pickles / papa george tonight was AWESOME.  There are so few times in life when an anticipated experience can live up to its imaginings, but when I sat down in that still-decorated-like-pickles restaurant and pulled out BOTH the old pickles menu AND the new, printed on paper, completely stylistically different greek menu, and our waitress came over wearing tan jeans and a tie-dye pickles tshirt and accepted our order for both a heineken in a frosty mug and a hummus appetizer, I almost lost it from the surreality of the situation.    It was unique, in an awesome, awesome way, for example, when the manager went over to the register at the bar, printed out a mysteriously long length of receipt tape, handed it to one of the waitresses, and told her that that was the wine list with prices.  Or that the specials whiteboard up front (a remnant of the pickles days) proclaimed that the side of the day was macaroni salad, but that the dessert of the day was baklava.  I kind of hope they keep it that way.    My pork souvlaki was actually very good.  The bread, vegetables, and rice that came with it were less than fresh but I really can't take any points away from them for low freshness when they are trying to pull off two full completely non-overlapping menus.  We ordered a hummus and pita appetizer, and they kept refilling our pita until all the hummus was gone, which was awesome.  We also sampled from the pickles menu; my friend ordered the hawaiian chicken sandwich and claims that it was \"actually really good.\"  Again, awesome."}
