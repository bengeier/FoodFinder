{"text":"What a great find this little place is! As the name suggests, they just provide pies and mash, but the range of pies is good and the items themselves are fantastic and only Â£5. Proper pastry, lovely mash and peas and served in enamel bowls! I had a great sausage and black pudding pie. Space inside is limited but the atmosphere is very welcoming, and he staff really friendly. Try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Humble Pie 'n' Mash is a hidden gem. When I walk past the restaurant I long for dinner time so I can go in. Every thing about this place is spot on. The restaurant is housed in a tiny old shop complete with inglenook fireplace and vintage decorations. The fire is always roaring, the tables always covered with pretty tablecloths and the service like popping round to a friend's house for supper.    The food is beautiful, really, really good stuff. Lovely pies and fresh, creamy mash served in tin pie dishes. I've never quite managed a pudding because the pies are really filling but my husband and father in law ensure me they are fantastic.    Seriously, this is the real Whitby. This isn't the tourist Whitby this is Whitby. Miss it at your peril."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat . Home cooked food . Great selection of pies and a great pie n mash dinner for 6.99 Miss this and you have missed out"}
{"text":"I am a definite regular to here when I come to whitby, I love the place, I have queued outside in the cold impatiently on many occasions!   Such good value, and always lovely staff, lovely quaint place, with dining space both upstairs and down, so don't be alarmed, that queue goes down quicker than you think.  Originally, I was reluctantly pulled in here by a particularly awful ex, but, am I glad he did! Vintage tunes on the radio, and the best pies I've had that I didn't bake myself.   Reasonably priced and served with lump free mash, good green peas (none of the over boiled grey ones here, thankfully!) and a good amount of gravy, though they will happily oblige with a little boat if you want more.  Pick from tea, camp coffee, and every fentimans pop you can get your mitts on, to go with your haggis and keeps/lamb and mint/steak and ale/ sausage and black pudding/hommity/ chicken and cider, roast veg and goats cheese, mince and onion, and they do do specials, the turkey christmas ice is pretty lovely.   They do run out sometimes, it's always busy, but everything I've had there has been lovely, and you're sat at tables cluttered with every condiment you could want too.   Good to note that they are also happy to let dogs in too."}
{"text":"Really great pie shop in Whitby, affordable and huge portions. Great service and love that since they don't have drinks on site they suggest you grab them from the pub next door! Wish I had more room in my stomach to try all the pies they had! Service was also excellent :) Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"I dreamt about the black pud & yorkshire sausage pie for weeks after eating it. As an American, it taught me that there's more to pie than just sweet fruit filling. I would absolutely recommend this place. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Pie Gravy Peas all for a fiver. We took the advice of our B & B owner and ate here for dinner. It was totally worth it everything is made in house and I mean everything the pastry crust the mash the filling. The whole shop just smells good think of Mrs Lovetts Pie shop in Sweeney Todd without the mashed up body parts and horrible pies. Its very small with only about 7 tables but its worth the wait if the tables are full. They do take away as well with the average time taking 15 to 20 minutes. They dont serve any beer or wine but from what Im told they will allow you to bring a bottle of your own. They do desserts that change everyday my wife got a jam roly poly which from what I was told was amazing and also hard to find in resturants now a days but it was served piping hot with freshly made custard. This place is the definition of a hole in the wall but it does what it says on the tin. HUMBLE PIE AND MASH and trust me its worth it."}
{"text":"Don't be put off from the appear when you enter.  The somewhat well worn look of the place and steamy interior could be off putting. The real reason to stay is the food. Pies are freshly made with mash, and peas.  You can pop across the road and bring back a cold pint to drink while you eat some of the best pies in all of Yorkshire. Charming, inexpensive and delicious food. A real winner.  Dog and kid friendly as well."}
