{"text":"My husband and I love grabbing takeout from his joint. It's our go-to spot for grabbing dinner when I'm too lazy to cook and when we have hungry guests.

Ravi is a perfectionist and we've been happy to go along for the ride as he tweaks his recipes. 

The food is not ready right away, but that just means that it hasn't been sitting around all day. The trick is to call ahead and ask what Ravi's got cooking that day.

Our fave order:
Fried fish with spinach rice (for our daughter)
Goat curry with roti gofer my husband)
Jerk chicken with rice and peas (for me)

We're still working our way through the menu, but it's tough to pass on our faves because they're solid every time :)"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to a hot meal this evening since my stove hasn't worked since Saturday. Boy was I disappointed! The chicken strips were way over done-- and I like my food well done but this was bad. The french fries were limp and way over done and far too greasy. Neither items tasted good, absolutely VILE. Can't finish them. What a waste of time and money. The payback has been worse. Even though it's just down the street, I won't return. EPIC FAIL. 
Next time I'll try 7-11 or drive to a chain."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I'm really impressed. The food is delicious and the customer service is amazing. I will definitely be back for the spinache rice and bbq chicken house special!"}
