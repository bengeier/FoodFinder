{"text":"I went there twice. It was not good when it first opened. But now is much better. Staff is friendly, food is okay. I like their mango slush. A convenient place for friends who live close by to gather."}
{"text":"Ordered a hot chocolate however the hot chocolate wasn't even hot it was barely luke warm, and took 5 minutes to make.   The cafe is never busy I wonder why; don't waste your time just go to Starbucks."}
{"text":"They don't have an exhaust fan, so if you stay inside you will smell like fried food. I ordered the wings, it was okay but for the price I wish it was bigger wings or they gave you more per order. Staff is friendly and being a resident of the condo nearby it's a convenient place to get food if you don't want to cook. They offer free delivery which is a fantastic!   A tip for the owners:  Fix the spelling errors from the signs displayed on your window to your menu. Chicken vs Chickren, Peking vs Perking, Original vs Orginal. You have the potential to be something great for our area, keep prices low or compensate with bigger portions (not just more rice). Consider adding bubble tea to the menu. :)"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to having a place I could walk to, to get a coffee & a bagel. I was let down. No bagels or sandwiches.  This place shouldn't be a restaurant. Cords are running around the floor. Health and safety issues all over. No proper ventilation. A guy was cutting his nails in the back area over a garbage bin. Appetizing! I waited 20 minutes for 2 coffees. It wasn't busy. The coffees were awful. The menu is too broad. If they just stuck to bagels, sandwiches, wraps and different drinks it would be much better. Instead they try cooking meals on electric pans that are plugged in. (Hence the cords all over). It's not a proper kitchen to offer the meals they're offering. They have sushi, hot rice dishes, different meats and other randomly added menu items. Spelling errors galore.  Everything looks unprofessional. The menu & Cafe.  The fridge for pop looked empty. The cafe has potential. They need more talkative staff, a proper kitchen and possibly a smaller menu. Quality over quantity.  I'll keep going to Starbucks in the meantime."}
{"text":"This isn't a restaurant or a cafe.  Its like its someone house that they just happen to sell food out of.  They don't have a full kitchen yet offer a massive menu, they don't even have proper ventilation so you will smell like their food for the rest of the day."}
