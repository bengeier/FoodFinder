{"text":"Saturday night and we were looking to go out, have some nice dinner...we were going to try out P.F. Changs since we had never been to it. Alas, two hour wait! No way.   So a short walk later we found Kyo. The inside was very nicely decorated, very quite, not many people.  We ordered two specialty rolls: The Golden Roll (which on the board it looked like the Goiden roll)  and the Four Seasons. Also, a miso soup that was simple and satisfying.  The Four Seasons was not very exciting, but good, tasted fresh. The Golden roll however was great. A big chunk of  deep fried soft shell crab, some more crab bits that were super delicious, good size...an overall great choice.    The service was polite, the food took a little bit but nothing I mind.  It made me think that it was a shame to have a two hour wait some short steps away and crickets chirping here because we left very satisfied with the food and the experience.  I will give it three stars for now and hopefully update it when I have a chance to come back.  I am not sure what Kevin K. is saying about getting plastic and styrofoam instead of the nice plates. We got everything on nice plates. Maybe they brought them back?"}
{"text":"Not a big sushi person. The hibachi however is pretty freaking good! A return trip here is inevitable."}
{"text":"The space is nicely decorated and well appointed. The food was tasty enough though the portion size was little on the smallish size. One thing I would suggest is that they use real silver ware and bowls/plate. Seems like when you drop a 10 spot for lunch you shouldn't be eating with a plastic fork out of a styrofoam bowl."}
{"text":"For a strip mall dive .... the combination fried rice especially with the Yum Yum sauce is just delicious."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte to have lunch. I can get fresh, delicious sushi for the same price I'd pay another restaurant to make a sandwich or something I can easily make at home.   The food is excellent. The restaurant is exceptionally clean and the wait staff and employees are very nice and attentive.  I'd give Kyo Cafe 10 stars if I had that option!"}
{"text":"I ordered on December 29, 2014, tempura shrimp sushi and hibachi steak and shrimp. I was really surprised how distasteful the food was. I received numerous menus on my door step because I live close by so I decided to give it a try. However, that was a mistake. The entire meal had an unusual taste to it. I had hibachi before nd nothing about this food was similar. In addition the steak was dry and  tough. The rice was hard barely fried. The sushi was nasty as well. I will not be returning. I have yet to find good Asian/Japanese food in Charlotte. The only sushi place that is adequate is sushi star so I will stick with them in Huntersville. I swear the dingy places have better food than these fancy places."}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi restaurant. The rolls were good however I would not recommend salad or spring rolls because the spring rolls are very greasy and the salad was terribly plain!"}
{"text":"We have gotten many delivery orders, all were fine, until last night. We waited 2 1/2 hours for our order. We called three times and all three times we were told it's on the way. It never came. When we called this morning to complain we basically got brushed off and the person on the phone blamed the driver and said they never received the order, we have the printed order confirmation and email. Her response was that she would give us 20% our next order. Really? We waited 2 1/2 hours for a dinner you kept telling us was coming and all you will give us is $5.00 off? You just lost a customer"}
{"text":"I often go to Kyo Cafe for lunch and I always get the Sushi lunch special. I have always found the food to be excellent and the staff has always been very friendly. The lunch specials are also offered at a very fair price. I highly recommend Kyo Cafe."}
{"text":"I never write reviews, but this place is disgusting.  I ordered the yellowtail appetizer and teriyaki beef.  Both were inedible.  The fish looked smelled and tasted horrible. Same for the steak, of that's what you want to call it.  I literally couldn't eat it  On a positive note.. The prices are great if you can stand to eat dog food."}
{"text":"I wish I could comment on this restaurant's food, but I was not given the opportunity to eat any. I arrived at the restaurant on a Friday evening at 9:20 pm, open sign absolutely BLARING on the front and back of the restaurant, and checked the hours sign on the door on the way in to ensure the restaurant wasn't closing at 9:30 (I'm not that person!). I was greeted by a glum hostess who just stared at me and then says, \"um, we're about to close soon... at 10:00.\" More staring ensues and I just turned and walked out. I can't have a meal at an EXPRESS restaurant 40 minutes prior to their closing?! The place was completely empty of patrons, by the way. Their booming business clearly didn't need one more customer. I was/am so po'd by this experience that I will never ever return. If you're in the mood for Japanese nearby, swing by Edomae in the Target lot."}
{"text":"Great place. Stopped by on a whim to find sushi. The staff was engaging and very kind. They had great suggestions on not just what is good but their personal favorites, which is nice since it isn't just them pushing the expensive rolls.  The food took a little to get out initially but after that it took no time. Wonderful place and I suggest the Joah Ark roll"}
{"text":"The best Hibachi in Charlotte. I have been here three times and am never disappointed with the food. Steak is super tender a veggies are amazing"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best sushi I have had in a long time. Got 3 special rolls( Cherry Blossom, The Surfer and Samurai). There are a lot of sushi places in charlotte but this is probably one of the better smaller restaurants."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this little spot. The food is amazing and very reasonable.  Although depending on the staff things can get a little chaotic.  But for the price & amount of food you can't go wrong.  Last time I was there a waitress indicated they let their liquor license expire, not good."}
{"text":"I stopped here on my lunch break. The first thing that struck me was how nice the ambience was. I was greeted within 15 seconds of walking through the door and immediately seated.  My girlfriend and I each ordered a sushi roll. I had the Golden roll which was absolutely wonderful! The perfect amount of spice and fried crab. My girlfriend had the Surfer roll which she was quite pleased with.  The waitress was friendly, and we were served our food within minutes of ordering. I only took away a star because the special (buy one sushi roll, get the 2nd half off) was never brought to our attention. If my girlfriend had not noticed it on a chalkboard sign near the door, we would not have taken advantage of the deal.  Over all: a great place for afternoon sushi!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place doesn't have more stars. It's the best sushi place in the area. Prices are affordable, sushi is fresh and delicious, service was superb and atmosphere is delightful. We split a bottle of wine,split a few egg rolls and had a couple of rolls (I recommend cherry blossom roll), it was a wonderful meal! I will be back here again for sure."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and not crowded at 1 or so.  The rolls are great and served fast!  Sushi at lunch can be a gamble but not here. I will be in!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is wonderful! They also have a great hibachi menu. I also love that they deliver to my apartment and never get lost!!"}
{"text":"Dining experience was not very good. I will not be going back. They served the appetizer after one of their entrees was served.  Sushi was okay. They also don't have sake."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good but the food was just \"meh.\" Sushi wasn't that great, and the hibachi was sub-par (the lack of shrimp sauce was a big strike). Steak was tough and overcooked. The shrimp were dry and overcooked. Nothing special."}
{"text":"I love that they have lunch specials on the weekends.  Service was great and sushi was fresh and delicious.  Hibachi was also really good!"}
{"text":"The food was great as usual, but an employee obviously brought their child to work. He was running around and riding a scooter. That didn't make for a relaxing dining experience. :("}
{"text":"They give you a lot of food. They have good food. I order takeout from them all the time. Pretty fast delivery."}
{"text":"Tried sushi here with my bf and it was pretty good. The interior is simple with the black wood and red walls but the Christmas lights made it a bit out of place lol, nothing to mind though. The dragon egg I must say was the BOMB; our first time having it. Our waitress was nice too. If I'm ever in the area, I'd go back here again for some sushi."}
{"text":"Pretty average Chinese food. Nothing special but I do LOVE that they deliver. Pretty good food at a great price and an inexpensive delivery fee."}
{"text":"I should've really listened to some of the reviews I read before giving this place a try... I ordered the chicken and steak combination with fried rice and a spring roll... The only thing I could stand to eat is the spring roll... The food had an awful smell with made me not want to eat the food. I tried it anyway and was very disappointed that I wasted my time and money... I wish I could've gave a better review but I simply can't"}
{"text":"The service is terrible. The food is average. Delivery is quoted 30-45 minutes. Sushi was delivered an hour and 15 minutes late and the man that answered the phone laughed about the lack of service. NEVER again will we order again. GROSS."}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable lunch specials, caterpillar rolls melt in your mouth.  Refreshing after driving all day!"}
{"text":"This place is meh. If you have a craving, it's a good spot to grab some cheapish sushi rolls for lunch: 2 rolls at $8.61 (with tax). Fresh isn't a word I use to describe the sushi (tastes more like supermarket sushi) but it's good in a pinch.  I've only had the sushi so I can't speak to any of the other menu items. I don't have any particular desire to try other items but, if the mood strikes, I wouldn't turn any down especially since they are located a few minutes from my job."}
{"text":"The sushi is mediocre as the seaweed paper is not chewable much less digestible. It certainly isn't fresh and tasted like they made it this morning and waited for someone to order it. Glad I started with just one roll.   The potstickers are okay. The flavor is good, but the meat inside is not as firm as I typically like it. I've had better, but it merited the 2nd star.   I wouldn't return and wouldn't recommend. You'll get better sushi from the Chinese buffet in University city. And perhaps friendlier service too."}
{"text":"If you asked me a few weeks ago, I would have given it 4 stars; but during my last two recent visits I have had some complaints. When they first opened, the food was served on nice plates and bowls with nice flatware. Now, they serve everything in plastic and styrofoam, big negative when I am spending around $14 for a combo.   The food is better than most other casual Japanese spots in Charlotte and the interior is impressive. Everything is nice and new with comfortable booths all around. Great for my occasional hibachi craving.   Bring back the nice dinnerware and I'll be able to justify dining here more often."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in the  charlotte area. The food is always fantastic and the staff is friendly and provide. Excellent service!"}
{"text":"We spent $50 on 3 rolls and a skimpy salad. Won't return. The rolls were subpar. The yellowtail was dry and nothing was fresh. The rice was a little over cooked and gummy.   This was a first and last trip."}
{"text":"Took an over an hour to get food. People who were seated after us were fed. Refilled drink one time during the hour wait for food. Had to request our salads which came with dressing when requested no dressing. Had to reorder food because someone forgot to enter our order all together.  Terrible experience all around.  Finally just left."}
{"text":"Sadly the food has decreased in quality since my last review. I thought it was a fluke the last time I was here but it seems to be true. Unfortunately I think the decrease in business has led to the decrease in quality of food and this cycle is very hard to break out of."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints...  Fresh delicious vegetables and dishes prepared to perfection. .. I  love  it  and the deliveries are quick hot and fresh.  No commercial are fast food taste. .. Just expertly prepared delicious entrees and appetizers  I highly recommend this restaurant...."}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch to check it out. I had the Yellowtail Jalapeño appetizer and the Maguro Madness roll. The service staff was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"So. 2 hours and still no food from delivery. In hotel. Excuse is they are busy. I bet this food will be cold and horrible."}
{"text":"Kyo Cafe changed my life when I discovered that they delivered to me.   The delivery minimum is average, $12. Delivery fee was $1.50. They also took an average amount of time to deliver, about 20 minutes. The food was still hot upon arrival.   I ordered miso soup and the seafood soup. My boyfriend ordered chicken hibachi. My miso was okay, I wish there were more scallions and flavor. The seafood soup was delicious. My boyfriends hibachi looked delicious and I had to beg to get him to let me get a taste. It was as good as it looked. The portion looked smaller in comparison to our go to take out but he didn't even finish his food. He reports it being filling.   For the price, quality, and location, this will definitely be a restaurant I return to to explore the menu."}
{"text":"I am DIGUSTED! This was the worst and I mean worst Japanese take out I've ever eaten! I ordered the teriyaki steak and chicken..large orders at that. The steak looked like they boiled it instead of cooking it on the griddle! I called them and asked for a refund before I left the parking lot and they told me no! I was not expecting my teriyaki steak to taste like garlic and onion powder. I've never tasted any Hibachi food like this. The chicken was not as bad but after I first tasted the steak I couldn't get the past the taste or the smell. Thumbs down for me."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Sushi place in my area! They deliver which is a HUGE plus! I haven't had any food from this great restaurant that I haven't liked. Ocean Rolls, Philly Rolls, Dragon Egg, Miso Soup, Hibachi veggies! You just can't go wrong! I will continue to be a repeat customer! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi place that is not too busy. Sushi looks better (and tastes better) than the menu would suggest."}
{"text":"Love the sushi here! The spicy shrimp roll is a favorite of mine and the special rolls are good (and fairly inexpensive) as well. I have yet to eat in but they deliver and the pick up is decently quick too. My favorite part is that there is an online ordering option and they actually pay attention to any changes you make to the order. I'll have to sit in and eat sometime because they have the cutest decor!"}
