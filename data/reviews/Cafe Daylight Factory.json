{"text":"Great menu although it hasn't changed in a while. Good service. Fantastic terrace in the summer...!"}
{"text":"Worse service ever, it took forever to get water, bread and our bill. We told them we were in a rush and it seems they didn't care. Too bad cause they have a nice terasse."}
{"text":"This is an place definitely worth a lunch visit. Food is fresh, tasty and served by confident staff. Every time I have visited it has been full of people chatting with each other and NOT staring morosely at their smartphones. The decor is unique and comfortable."}
{"text":"First, let us say that we love Montréal. We visited a few years ago, and it seems nothing can keep us from coming back. So, when we decided to celebrate our wedding in the city - and bring 32 of our closest friends and family with us - we needed a top-notch spot for our reception. No Vieux-Port Steakhouse or Chez Suzette for us. Café Daylight Factory was the absolute perfect fit.

The restaurant is only open for lunch during weekdays, so we had full reign of the entire space for an incredibly nominal fee. It was literally all ours. The menu was catered just to us, allowing us to show our family the food and flavors we absolutely love about the Montréal food scene: curried butternut squash soup, beet tartare, filet, sea bass, chocolate-mocha mousse cake, salmon tartare, vegetable rolls, coriander shrimp...I could go on and on and on... 

The service from the staff was impeccable. Wine glasses were never empty, there were food options for everyone and every diet (vegetarians and gluten-free, too!), and even a bumping sound system (complete with mixer!) to be your own DJ. Even our grandmother ate raw fish, and that's something that should go down in history and is a testament to Duane's prowess in the kitchen. There was absolutely nothing that could have been better.

Alex and his staff also took care of setting up the space, working with our wedding manager to make sure everything was beyond perfect. We were even able to rent a portable outdoor heater for the gorgeous terrace so our party could spill into the courtyard throughout the evening.

So, I'm sure you're thinking, \"Oh wow, this must be a REALLY expensive place to have a wedding reception.\" Nope. Not at all. It's actually a fraction of the price you'd pay at standard hotel and event venues with MUCH more personal touches. Our family and friends are STILL talking about how wonderful the food, ambiance, and event space were. Café Daylight Factory really left an impression.

Alex, Duane, and Nadia left no stone unturned to make our day the best of our lives. From the beginning of the planning process, they were attentive and openly communicated with us. Alex provided several quotes throughout the months as our guest list took shape, helped us with seating arrangements, and answered so many of our questions. We never felt like we were in the wrong hands. 

Overall, you can't go wrong with this venue for a wedding. We plan on returning to Montréal yearly, and Café Daylight Factory will always be on our list to re-visit. We'll always make it a point to have a glass of wine at the bar with the staff, too. In large part, they became our friends over the last several months.

Do yourself a favor and book this place before it becomes THE PLACE to have wedding receptions in the city."}
{"text":"Another spot to add to my list of Places to Lunch in the Old Port. A keeper, this one.

Depending on the weather, you can stay inside and stay cool in the spacious, chic interior room, or you can go outside and sun yourself on the fairly sizable terrace. 

They have a fresh, seasonal menu of a daily soup, a collection of tasty-sounding sandwiches and salads, and a meal of the day. My friend found the meal of today (rice noodles with a meat sauce) a bit heavy for her taste, but most of the rest of the options are fairly light. My salad with blackened chicken, feta cheese, walnuts, and maple vinaigrette was just right for lunch on a hot summer day. We had a small bowl of gazpacho to start as well, which was unusually spiced and good. 

They have what looks like a nice by-the-glass wine list, but the work waiting for me in the afternoon kept me from sampling it. So I opted for a limonata, which was especially refreshing when the sun started hitting my back.

They're mostly a weekday lunch place, opened Monday-Friday. But they occasionally do events, and I am curious to check out their weekly Thursday 5 à 7.

I spied a few moving plates of the house gravlax served with baby potatoes and arugula on my way out. I think I've already found my next lunch at Daylight Factory."}
{"text":"We had our wedding at Cafe Daylight Factory. It was great - the food for all 50+ guests was delicious and served promptly. The chef and all the staff worked extra hard and Marc, who runs the place was extremely helpful and just an amazing guy to deal with. Everyone went far above and beyond what we have expected and created a truly excellent experience."}
